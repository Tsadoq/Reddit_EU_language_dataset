Same goes for a lot of crops etc. For species that have evolved over millions of years in one area it's not that easy to just adapt within a century to a completely different environment. It's not like the temperature rises uniformly over the whole planet, so that the north becomes the same as what is now the south. For example the north will still have more pronounced seasonal variation which the species further south is not adapted to. Also the ocean and ground will overall become more acidic.

As soon as they were distributed commercially, yes. If their contents were spread person-to-person by unpaid members of the electorate,  no.

Unless they can prove that they both believed it to be true based on  convincing evidence, and that they put proportional good-faith effort into investigating allegations against every other side of politics. Selectively reporting the truth is as bad if not worse than reporting falshoods. 

The obvjtive is to obliterate all forms of paid or magnified potiltical messaging, and to place all candidates on an absolutely even footing.

Why do so many Eastern European nations that used to be associated with the Soviet Union/Russia now reject it- to the point that they wish to kill any influence it might have moving into the future? 

The problem that many in the world have with Russia is based solely on its actions, its posture towards the world and has nothing to do with conspiracy theories or media coverage. It is because of what Russia chooses to represent.

**Edit:** To the [bad faith](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/9hfpdt/all_27_eu_leaders_believe_theresa_mays_brexit/e6d58i3/) argument below me: we don't have free movement with any European country, so naturally we enforce immigration controls on a national level. You don't allow Canadians to freely move to Europe. Does that mean you don't believe in Free Movement? Of course not.

If people are circumventing our immigration controls, we need to put processes in place to to prevent that. It's not because we're anti-immigration but because false asylum claims eat up a lot of resources. As soon as a claim is made these people are enrolled in health care, can freely seek work, and take away asylum resources from those that might be more deserving. Everyone gets a hearing and is assume to qualify until the claim is evaluated.

In the case of free movement, it only works if it comes with an agreement for healthcare sharing arrangements. Unless those are in place, we aren't left with many choices *but* to enforce our controls more rigidly or abuse of the systems could create an unfair burden on Canada.

As evidence for our willingness to explore free movement options I'd point to CANZUK polling opinions that put us at [75% support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANZUK_International), while acknowledging that this organization is particularly biased and so the results should be taken with a grain of salt. That said, the Conservative Party of Canada (the second major party in Canada, who formed government from 2006‚Äì2015) put adopting a CANZUK agreement in their election platform. For their discussion at their national convention see: [this video](http://www.cpac.ca/en/programs/cpac-special/episodes/64121390) at around 01:04:00.

&gt;**In the 12 weeks to mid-September, US soybeans accounted for 52% of imports to the EU, rising 133 percent compared with the same period last year to 1.47 million tonnes. The United States had just 25% of the market in the same period of 2017.**

&gt;Imports from Brazil dropped to a 40% share of the bloc‚Äôs roughly 35 million tonne annual import market for the animal feed staple.

&gt;**European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker pledged in a White House deal in late July that Europeans would buy more US soy as part of a package to avert threatened tariffs from Washington on US imports of EU cars.**

&gt;The EU executive has been collating frequent new import data to prove it is keeping its side of the bargain ‚Äì even though the trends are largely the result of price movements in world markets. The EU had no previous barriers to US soybeans.

&gt;In June, China largely stopped buying US soybeans in retaliation for trade measures Trump targeted at Beijing ‚Äî prompting European farmers to switch to buying cheaper US soy.

2) Stanislaw Piotrowicz, the Polish Law and Justice Party MP who propagates the Polish ‚Äòjudicial reform‚Äô project in parliament, for example, is a former communist prosecutor who locked up dissidents in the 1980s.


Author states that Polish judiciary does not need decommunisation and than points out that leading force behind these changes is an ex commie. This is not contradictory sensu stricto, but it makes one think whether the author is not presenting a biased version of reality.

 Let me just say that Chief Justice (I think he  just retired) worked for communist apparatus of repression (WSW). And he was not the only one who supported totalitarian system.

&gt; 1. Fascism is an organic nationalist ideology founded by Giovanni Gentile and Benito Mussolini, it believes that the nation should act like an organ, like the human body. We all have a part to play, when one part fails to do it's part the nation crumbles. To achieve this organic nationalism, Fascism believes in State Corporatism. State Corporatism is a mix of both left wing economics and right wing economics, believing in the value of private property but realizing that socialist economics can fight the inherent flaws in the Capitalist system. With State Corporatism , Fascism also strongly believes in Tradition, believing that peoples should protect their culture and society as we have done for thousands of years. To create this society Fascism believes in Totalitarianism, as it sees the State as the great unifier of the masses, without the State there is no unity. Fascism takes this to its logical conclusion giving the State total control over the nation with the goal of creating and preserving a Fascist society.

It‚Äôs hard to lose an election when you control ballot access, the government bureaucracy, the courts, the media, and the votes of vast swathes of the population dependent on state support ‚Äì and when you are personally endorsed by the supposedly admired national leader. Yet Vladimir Putin‚Äôs ruling United Russia party still managed to come out on the wrong end of last week‚Äôs gubernatorial election in Primorye region, Russia‚Äôs far eastern territory. With 98 percent of the ballots counted, the Kremlin-appointed incumbent was [trailing](https://meduza.io/feature/2018/09/17/samye-strannye-vybory-2018-goda-kommunist-ischenko-protiv-edinorossa-tarasenko-v-primorie-glavnoe) the Communist Party candidate by 47 percent of the vote to 50 percent. The only trick left to the authorities was old-fashioned ballot-stuffing: the incumbent, Acting Gov. Andrei Tarasenko, was declared the winner after [several dozen precincts](https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2018/09/17/781050-gubernator-dalnego-plavaniya) gave him 100 percent of the vote on a 100-percent turnout in the final two hours of counting.

The real winner, a 37-year-old construction executive and regional legislator by the name of Andrei Ishchenko, has no major political achievements, no charisma and no proposals worthy of note. His personality, his politics and his party affiliation did not matter. He had only one advantage in the eyes of voters: He was running against the candidate Putin endorsed.

‚ÄúRussians are slowly coming to the idea of ‚ÄòAnyone but United Russia,‚Äô‚Äù [noted](https://www.facebook.com/visboris/posts/1831628190248684?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAloG6iVhd7pkVbL8aZYnDs2kGfrBvhLOlXBNZies5FyR-Cq6jVWYkbA-k-yeRYSIso-dyTB9szulTZ6o1QF5THosSnP7oIrPj7khqnbJJWB9txJ6Txl2zRgPCHKJZPn3HaGv458tYzUGitLj4qFnHYYe8v79VqTGiyTVbhYNlXwlIC5MYqug&amp;__tn__=-R) Boris Vishnevsky, an opposition lawmaker in the St. Petersburg Legislative Assembly. ‚ÄúThis is very similar to 1990, when it was ‚ÄòAnyone but the Communists.‚Äô The mole of history digs slowly, but irrevocably.‚Äù

 

Vishnevsky knows what he is talking about: He was first elected as a municipal legislator in what was then Leningrad in the pro-democracy wave of 1990, when opposition to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was almost enough to guarantee victory. Nationwide, that election gave rise to a generation of democratic politicians, including Boris Nemtsov, Sergei Yushenkov and Pyotr Filippov; the leader of the pro-democracy movement, Boris Yeltsin, became speaker of Russia‚Äôs parliament. Amazingly, that election was still officially (though no longer in practice) held within the constraints of a one-party system.

The one issue that turned so many residents of Russia‚Äôs Far East into protest voters was the pension reform recently announced by the Russian government. Citing a shortage of money ‚Äî and, in effect, admitting that Russia‚Äôs windfall of oil revenues has been wasted (or misappropriated) ‚Äî the government proposed to raise the retirement age from 55 to 60 for women, and from 60 to 65 for men (in a country where the average male life expectancy is [67 years.](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.MA.IN?locations=ru)) [Street protests](https://snob.ru/entry/165469)¬† broke out all over the country. As is customary, peaceful demonstrators were met with police batons and jail sentences.

 

In a [statement](https://navalny.com/p/5960/) from his jail cell, where he was sent ahead of the rallies, anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny called on the residents of the Far East to go to the streets to defend their votes and on people from other regions to support them. ‚ÄúLet us forget about ideological differences, it doesn‚Äôt matter which party Ishchenko represents,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThe blatant and brazen election fraud in Primorye is an insult ‚Ä¶ to the whole country.‚Äù Even before Navalny‚Äôs call, people [began to gather](https://vladnews.ru/2018-09-17/138210/miting_storonnikov) on Vladivostok‚Äôs main square, in front of the governor‚Äôs office, to protest the fraud.

In the end, the protests did not have time to get underway. The Kremlin calculated that the fraud was too blatant even by its own standards,and dispatched a delegation from the Central Election Commission to Vladivostok. Playing the ‚Äúgood cop,‚Äù the commission‚Äôs chair, Ella Pamfilova, directed local officials to annul the election results. It is the first time this has happened in Russia since 2002. A rerun will be held in December.

Whatever its outcome, nothing will change in practical terms. The Communist Party has long accepted its role as a loyal opposition in the Kremlin‚Äôs managed political system. Its members elected to positions of authority, such as Irkutsk Gov. Sergei Levchenko or Novosibirsk Mayor Anatoly Lokot, have faithfully toed the Kremlin line where it mattered. The significance of what happened in Russia‚Äôs Far East on Sept. 16 lies elsewhere: It is a sign that Russians are beginning to look for any alternative to a regime increasingly seen as corrupt and out of touch. For a long time, the Kremlin has managed to maintain its political dominance and its facade of popularity by [preventing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2018/08/14/the-kremlin-is-taking-no-chances-as-moscow-moves-ahead-with-its-sham-mayoral-election/?utm_term=.7fbc6265b395) the strongest opponents from getting on the ballot.

344,"Except... no, the US wasn't a clean slate, you didn't pop out of nothingness without any idea and went ""meh, democracy ?"". I feel like I'm repeating his name all over Reddit these days, but go read Emmanuel Todd's theories on the relationship between family structures and political ideologies. US had, and still does have, a British-like cultural base. France had, for centuries, a different family structure that lead to different ideas becoming important.

&amp;#x200B;

And no, the system wasn't halfway between democracy and monarchy. For nearly a century, we went from one to the other (from one system based on ideas of the Revolution to one based on monarchy) nearly every 15 to 20 years. The first system to stand more than 20 years was the Third Republic that started in 1870. France lost a lot to this instability, it also won a lot. Example : UK still has a queen, US still has electoral college, these systems are old and will continue to age, our instability kept our system young and fresh. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be very surprised if the 5th Republic makes it to 2027, at which point it would become the longest lasting political system France had since the Revolution, and if a 6th Republic were to come, it would either be a big jump back, or a big jump forward, as France tends to do, only history will tell which one it is.

So it's not about the GFA and the use of Ireland as a wedge issue then? The point is that the GFA isn't going to be breached, indeed the UK and Irish positions maintain the aims of the GFA. The issue is that the EU is using the threat of a hard border to try and win a concession that keeps NI in the SM and CU, and so breaches UK territorial integrity and tethers the UK to the EU in unacceptable ways. Arguably that's as much of an issue for the GFA (if we are using as broad a definition as you seem to be) as anything else could be.

The solution would seem to be off border customs checks, coupled with a decently neat agreement on the trade of goods with the EU, but for reasons that I don't entirely understand, the EU has been claiming that the former is unacceptable (again, until today..) and that the latter is somehow cherry picking, or splitting up the four freedoms.",,/r/europe/comments/9hfpdt/all_27_eu_leaders_believe_theresa_mays_brexit/e6cidk3/,ajehals,1537485049

&gt;Emmanuel Macron explained France‚Äôs hard line Brexit stance, saying the U.K.‚Äôs departure from the European Union must come at a cost or it would threaten the bloc‚Äôs integrity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Speaking to reporters after a summit in Salzburg, Austria, the French president said that the EU would be at risk if it failed to show the consequences of leaving and branded U.K. hard-liners who insisted the process would be easy as ""liars.""  
&gt;  
&gt;France consistently takes the toughest stance in Brexit discussions, EU diplomats say. It opposes nearly every European idea aimed at finding a compromise and insists that Britain must be seen to lose from Brexit, according to one official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Yes, i disagree with this, because her motivation with the pics was not even close to this. She wanted to use her influence to create a fake ""nationalist"" protest, which can (and probably will) become violent. And if it will become violent (f.e. they will start beating random innocent foreigners, destroying cars, buildings etc) and the police will beat the shit out from the ""protesters"" then she can post tons of pics, videos etc. about the ""BRUTALITY OF THE STATE"".




&gt; bringing the topic to the public's mind is undeniably correct.

But this topic was ALWAYS public.. Holy shit, you think she get those pics from some secret agency or what? The liveleak, 4chan and the watchpeopledie are full with ISIS videos / pictures... And i will repeat it again: in France is illegal to share anything like this to anybody. She knew this, this is the reason why they will do psychiatric test on her. 

We will see, she did this because she wanted to create some kind of chaos (so the thing what putin want) or she is just mental ill. 

I think she is not 100% because of the bombing in the '70s but her motivation was political in this case.

https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/citizens-guide-us-federal-law-obscenity

This is the US version. Notice its basically the exact same thing she's being charged with, exept it's based around sex rather than violence.

The penalty for knowingly showing obscene material (with obscene being entirely subjective even in the law itself) is up to 10 years in prison.

During the Bush administration the DoJ started an obscenity task force which was stopped by the Obama administration, but Jeff Sessions is on record that he would go after pornography.

To cut to the chase. The SCOTUS ruled that obscenity is an exption to free speech and made the definition exceptionally broad in Miller v. California. If this were tried in the US the burden would actually be on Le Pen to show that the video had ""serious political value"" which would be possible, but nowhere near a slam dunk and it would most certainly survive a motion to dismiss as weather a beheading video has said political value is question of fact, not one of law.

Expert of course for the fact that only sex is obscene under US law (being expressly listed in 2 of the 3 tests) so she would never go to trial for that video, but would if it was sexual. ",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/9hfd68/frances_marine_le_pen_ordered_to_undergo/e6c0npt/,neohellpoet,1537469624

And other tribes remember that. So if their authority drops too low, some might start to wonder...

Another thing is that oil no longer as profitable as it used to be. New sources have opened in USA and Europe, while push for cleaner economy led to preference for other fuels like natural gas.

638,"&gt; It's about being confident to strike out into the world.

You can be confident to strike out off of a cliff, but we generally call that madness.

The analogy wasn't picked randomly either, since a no deal brexit means precisely striding off a cliff, with the sudden voiding of many fundamental deals that enable the basic logistics of international commerce, on which all countries depend.

If the UK wants to go into the sea and leave the mainland behind (still following the analogy), it should avoid the cliff and negotiate to take the longer route around. Six, maybe ten years of transition to fully untangle all the shared issues and make ready alternate systems to pick up where the old ones terminate.

But that's not what your government is doing. It's boldly marching towards that cliff, all the while requesting that the rest of Europe build it a slip-and-slide to its specifications.

652,"&gt; That doesn‚Äôt make it more democratic, each country appoints a commissioner in a similar way to the UK cabinet 

But unlike the cabinate i can't vote them out of office if i disagree with them. 

They are also more powerful than the cabinate because unlike in the UK only they are the only people in the EU who can write and put legislation to a vote. 

Basically if they don't approve of something the elected representatives don't even get a chance to vote on it. 

So i will agree that they are like a more powerful less accountable version of the UK cabinate.

No they wouldn't the EU is the most difficult organisation on earth to deal with when it comes to trade agreements. That's why all there trade deals take 5x longer than everyone else and tend to fall apart at the last min. 

Also they tend to be focused on goods instead of services which is great for Germany but not helpful for the UK. 

&gt;They don‚Äôt trade on WTO terms like the UK would potentially do under a no deal scenario.

687,"Oh I don't believe it should be an obligation to use a term or not, obviously that would be bizarre, my point was disagreeing that they are merely technical terms and that when if we use the correct term to describe what happened then we are being accurate but on the other hand when there is intention to not describe the event as it occurred then other terms are used on purpose. As for moral, social or psychological connotations or qualifications, that is another debate, but I do not see why these should cause not to use accurate descriptions of events - that wouldn't be an honest nor accurate way of going on about describing and expressing facts. In any case a murder could be a more tragic event for a family than a loved one killed in an accident, but this doesn't mean that the latter was not tragic. Similarly a genocide is an act against a group and not individuals and as such *could* have a deeper effect than massacres or killings, but this doesn't mean that the latter are not tragedies either. But yes this is debatable as it goes beyond the mere description of facts and circumstances and enters the terrain of morality, psychology and social issues.

It doesn't help at all that terms such as *genocide* are politicised beyond reason by all sides, the advocates as well as the deniers. After all most nations have committed genocides and it just happens that many do not want to face it so they involved themselves in the politicisation of such terms and notions. But this doesn't mean that the term itself isn't *the only accurate* description of something which has occurred many times - the intentional destruction of a group as that group.

Actually in law a War Crime or Crime Against Humanity (which are separate crimes than genocide) have equally bad consequences for the perpetrators as the the Crime of Genocide. So it is politics (and Hollywood) which have caused these problems.

For example to go to an extreme and politically incorrect example to get my point across, killing 900 Chinese in a massacre somewhere in China is not the same as killing 900 people of a specific group of which only 900 people exist (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_War) - The families and friends of the Chinese sure will suffer, but there would be no families and friends who suffer for the latter case. The latter case would be a genocide in whole. There is a fundamental difference between what a genocide is and what a massacre is. Genocide is not simply about killing people, but about killing a group as that group. This distinction is what sets it apart from other descriptions of crimes and events.

&gt; In conclusion, if we accept these events as genocide; it will be ""That asshole Leopold"" and ""Cruel Belgium"" 

This is part of the problem. Genocides are usually attributed to the nations whose members committed it - and this is very wrong for a start because the crime of genocide does not deal with nations, but individual perpetrators (a tribunal doesn't take the country to trial, it takes the individual people who committed the crimes) so it begs the question why is a whole nation marked as ""Cruel Belgium"" or you know, how the Armenian genocide is used against Turks as an outlet for anti-Turkish sentiment or political purposes. This is wrong on too many levels to list here. In any case ""That asshole Leopold"" would be accurate regardless.

I agree.

742,"&gt;Man that's a lot of words for some basic stupidity and some pedantic bullshit.

You consider that short comment a lot of words?

What's ""pedantic"" or ""stupid"" about anything I said? Being precise and careful with words doesn't mean being pedantic. It's simply the basis of any constructive debate.

&gt;We are talking about a free market here. 

No. We are talking about right-wing economic views. Which has nothing to do with a ""free market"". Right wingers generally try and restrict markets as much as possible. One example has already been given: Copyrights. 

Again: Right wing simply means regulating the market in favour of elites. 

In the meantime, no such thing as a free market exists.

&gt;The free market always tends to the most profitable outcome for suppliers. 

Citation needed. How do workers supplying labour benefit from the free market? Oh, that's right: They don't. 

The free market does nothing but consolidate wealth due to its monopolizing effect. The party with more leverage wins. A ""free"" market is inherently inefficient and often also incredibly ineffective as it inhibits competition and therefore progress.

&gt;In almost all cases regulations do not directly apply to consumers, but to suppliers. 

Left wing regulations usually serve to prevent market failure. They almost exclusively apply to parties directly causing negative externalities or being in a privileged position (re: information asymmetry, economic inequality) or to protect the supply of public goods from being undermined by private interests. That is usually capitalist manufacturers or employers. Except when it comes to contract law, regulations don't concern themselves with ""suppliers"" or ""consumers"". In fact, left wing regulations usually target manufacturers in the role of a *consumer* (e.g. if you consume fossil fuels, you need to pay carbon tax).

Right wing regulations usually serve to protect the interests of elites. They concern themselves with promoting market failure (e.g. by creating artificial private monopolies or by preventing others from assessing information), enabling rent seeking, disenfranchising opposition supporting competition, and generally preventing competition from forming (especially by preventing nationalization or the creation of public entities), or using tariffs and taxes to make people from other nations less competitive.

Neither type of regulation concerns itself with who the ""supplier"" of a good or service is. All regulation concerns itself with preventing specific economic behaviour by restricting the *source* of said behaviour.


&gt;Thus, more regulations is almost always something that cuts into profits for companies in order to achieve some goal that is deemed more important than profits.

Not really. 

*Left wing* regulation often is something designed to prevent the exploitation of workers or society as a whole. It might certainly cut into the profit of companies. 

*Right wing* regulation is usually designed to increase the profit of companies but usually comes at the expense of society as a whole (usually the workers or people paying for health care).

Now explain what your point is in the context of this conversation.

You have asked a question. It has been answered. It was also explained why your opinion is wrong in the context of the conversation about right wing politics and regulation. Now you just stated some truisms without really relating them to anything that was said so far. Could you elaborate?


Maybe try and learn to express yourself more thoroughly and clearly. Use more words to express your ideas instead of throwing some oversimplified truisms into the ring and pretending them to be self-evident. Also learn to address what was actually said. The arguments against your position are a bit more thorough than your limited and dismissive comments capture. If you can't follow, ask questions instead of pretending people are wrong. You haven't even acknowledged the answer you received in response to your own question, so it seems you just want to push an unsubstantiated opinion without actually caring about facts (while not actually substantiating that opinion when asked).

That's like saying ""Saddam Hussein won"" his election in the 90s. It's true in the sense that there was an election and he was declared the winner of it, but false in any meaningful sense.

The majority of people would rather Democrats be in power, but Republicans have spent decades rigging the game in their favor.

If you then think that somehow an article like this is why the Democrats ""lost"", that says more about your ignorance of American political realities than anything.

Stalin climaxed with the words, ""And such an Army was insulted by no one else but Djilas! Djilas, of whom I could least have expected such a thing, a man whom I received so well! And an Army which did not spare its blood for you! Does Djilas, who is himself a writer, not know what human suffering and the human heart are?

1084,"&gt; In any case, the UK is also building a nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point, if they ever get around to finishing it. Which is projected at 3200MW. 

Yes. It's projected to generate 25 TWH a year. All the wind farms in the UK generated about 50 TWH last year. All the existing nuclear in the UK generated 70 TWH.

&gt;Nuclear energy is being phased out not because its bad, but because its too expensive 

It's being phased back in in the UK because it's cheaper. Wind energy in the UK receives 11p per KWH. Hinkley will receive 9.25p. Wind also requires large supporting batteries for frequency management, grid reinforcement because it's built in out of the way locations, and support for backup gas and coal plants because it's systemically unreliable.

And because wind has capacity factors around 30%, coal and gas have to provide around the same amount of power as wind generates. That's why wind (and solar) can reduce the UK's emissions, but only to about 180 grams per KWH. Nuclear can take us below the 50 gram target we need to meet in future.

&gt;Hinkley is projected to be completed in 2025 at a cost of ¬£20bn - so if we add in the usual 100% time &amp; cost overruns we should get it online at around 2034 for a cost of ¬£40bn.

Hinkley is being built by the private sector for a fixed strike price. If the cost overruns, the bill payers don't pay extra for it. 

That's almost certainly the wrong way for the contract to have been written, but the government were only interested in minimising risk to the public. The National Audit Office calculated the electricity produced by Hinkley could have been about half the price if the government had absorbed some of the financial risk. That's probably what will happen for future reactors.",,/r/europe/comments/9hc8ey/uk_wind_breaks_through_20_gigawatt_mark/e6b2rfu/,WhiteSatanicMills,1537433782

1177,"Okay, I can't agree with you on Peter's stance on peasants, but you do make a good point.

The war though, have you read up on it? Sure, Charles was an extraordinary commander, and the swedish army of that time was one of the best in Europe, but up to the stage where Charles went on southwards, stretching his supply lines and losing a whole lot of men to sickness, the military genius of Peter's army amounted to mustering more men and being confident that an advantage in numbers alone will win the battle. Seriously, count the battles in which Russian military command was sure Charles wouldn't go on a suicide attack against a superior force, while Charles just exploited the tactical advantages he had or could create! That's incompetence on a level close to 1941's, even without a preceding purge, and the only response was to keep throwing meat in the grinder and do the same thing all over again, quite similar to what was done in 1941.

On top of that, are you seriously going to defend the cost of St. Petersburg's construction? Sure, a port in the Baltic was needed. Building a port in the middle of a swamp specifically to show off and get an ego boost from its name and fame was not.

If you're trying to justify Peter from the standpoint of using people as a resource, I've got bad news for you again: the terror of 1937 significantly diminished the potential for a fifth column during the war, and the GULag, the part that IIRC claimed by far the most lives out of all forms of said terror, was a system of forced labor camps.

&gt; Ach Berlin. Was ist Berlin? Berlin ist die Stadt f√ºr die man sich als Deutscher auf internationaler B√ºhne sch√§men muss. Wenn man Berlin mit anderen europ√§ischen Hauptst√§dten wie London, Paris, Madrid und Amsterdam vergleicht, treibt es jedem anst√§ndigen Menschen die Schamesr√∂te ins Gesicht. Selbst kleine L√§nder wie √ñsterreich, Belgien oder die Schweiz haben mit Wien, Br√ºssel und Z√ºrich international vorzeigbare St√§dte mit hoher Lebensqualit√§t. Deutschland ist gestraft mit Berlin, der Hauptstadt der Versager. Berlin beheimatet mit Abstand am meisten Arschl√∂cher in der gesamten Republik. Deutsche Bahn, Bundestag, Air Berlin und der Axel Springer Verlag sind nur einige Beispiele f√ºr den unf√§higen Abschaum der hier beherbergt wird.
&gt; 
&gt; Glorreiche Zeit sind schon l√§ngst vorbei, diese Stadt liegt am Boden. Der Berliner an sich ist durch und durch ein fauler Lump. Charaktereigenschaften die in jedem zivilisierten Kulturkreis als pure Faulheit, Unfreundlichkeit, Unf√§higkeit, dissoziale Pers√∂nlichkeitsst√∂rung und Dummheit gelten, erkl√§rt der Berliner kurzerhand zur Berliner Wesensart. Ein weiteres zentrales Merkmal ist der alles beherrschende Minderwertigkeitskomplex. Deswegen projiziert der Berliner auf jeden der in irgendeiner Weise besser ist als er, massive Hassgef√ºhle. Besonders die ihm in allen Belangen haushoch √ºberlegenen S√ºddeutschen sind ihm ein Dorn im Auge. Er neidet ihnen den Erfolg und M√ºnchen steht ganz oben auf seiner Hassliste. Diese Stadt ist alles und hat alles was der Berliner gerne w√§re und h√§tte. Das M√ºnchen dem Berliner sein Lotterleben finanziert, interessiert den Berliner nicht, er glaubt sogar insgeheim er h√§tte es verdient. Anstatt sich aus seiner aus Neid und Missgunst entstehenden Lethargie zu befreien und seine Stadt umzukrempeln, ergeht er sich in asozialen Schmarotzertum und h√§lt noch gro√üe St√ºcke auf seine vermeintliche Weltstadt.
&gt; 
&gt; Kulturell ist Berliner eher schwach veranlagt, gro√üe Werke liegen lang zur√ºck. Auch gilt hier bereits das Aussprechen des Buchstaben ¬ªg¬´ als ¬ªj¬´ als gro√üe Kulturleistung. Fortgeschrittene beherrschen sogar das Anh√§ngen eines ¬ªwa?¬´ an den Ende eines jeden Satzes. Das Leistungsniveau in der K√ºche bewegt sich auf √ºberschaubarem Niveau. Eine Wurst aus gemahlenem Seperatorenfleisch mit Ketchup und Currygew√ºrz wird hier als Currywurst und als kulinarischer Geniestreich verkauft. Jeder vern√ºnftig denkende Mensch h√§lt eine Wurst mit Ketchup wohl kaum f√ºr den heiligen Gral der K√ºchenkunst und wahrscheinlich noch nicht einmal f√ºr ein Rezept. Gro√üz√ºgig l√§sst der Rest der Republik den Berliner in diesem Glauben um seine Minderwertigkeitskomplexe nicht √ºberhand nehmen zu lassen.
&gt; 
&gt; Wirtschaftlich ist Berlin ein einziges Desaster, selbst die sp√§te DDR stand solider da. Ansonsten fu√üt die Berliner Wirtschaft auf alternativen Blogs, irgendwas mit Medien und Genderstudies wenn man den Universit√§ten glauben darf. Ungeachtet des wirtschaftlichen Bankrottes leistet sich der Berliner trotzdem Prestigeprojekte wie das Stadtschloss und einen Flughafen der mangels Funktionst√ºchtigkeit als Kunstprojekt gelten soll. Ebenso beherbergt diese Stadt s√§mtliche Zentralen der Volksparteien, die aus Marketinggr√ºnden auf das ¬ªVerr√§ter¬´ im Namen verzichten. B√ºrgermeister dieser Stadt war lange der lustige Wowib√§r der mit seiner Prestige&amp;Prosecco Politik alles in den Abgrund riss, was noch halbwegs pr√§sentabel war.
&gt; 
&gt; Kurzum: Berlin ist der Fliesentisch Deutschlands. Es ist das f√ºr Deutschland, was Griechenland f√ºr die Europ√§ische Union ist und h√§tte Berlin eine offene Kloake, w√§re es das Rum√§nien Deutschlands. Berlin ist ein Schandfleck, der Pickel am Arsche Deutschlands. Berlin ist der Typ der ohne Einladung auf deine Party kommt, noch nicht mal Alkohol mitbringt und auch nicht versteht dass er nicht erw√ºnscht ist wenn man ihm ein paar Z√§hne aus dem Gesicht klopft und die Treppe runterwirft. Berlin ist das Detroit Deutschlands und geh√∂rt f√ºr 200 Z≈Çoty an Polen verkauft.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/9hb70x/population_density_map_of_germany/e6aud66/,Isuckatnicknames,1537418906

I've worked at a small company selling through Amazon's marketplace. Honestly, we sold through pretty much every marketplace we could, and Amazon always made me angry; they look at what we sold, what was really working well, then bought tons of same product at trashed price we could not compete with (small company vs Amazon) and sold it lower than us. They did this I believe with everything that's going through their marketplace, and the reason why they're being investigated is this, I think.

1259,"I know Germans are very pragmatic and stuff, and that's what makes them great, but I gotta disagree here. Even if Ukraine is talking mostly out of self interest for transit fees(which I doubt). Ukraine is solidly pro EU and aligns with them. They are on the front lines with Russia every single day dying. Thousands have died. EU did not do enough to help Ukraine. Crimea annexation is one of the biggest scars on the Western prestige since the cold war ended. Obviously USA fucked up too, but this was Europe's backyard.

Russia was able to snatch territory in Europe, which really hasn't been done in an openly militaristic manner. And we were totally caught off guard. Just 4 years later, European countries are piling up left and right for those who want to loosen the sanctions. That is geopolitical weakness and it matters. 

Why is NS2 a threat? It's the same reason why if you add a gas subsidy you're harming electric cars. NS2, if built will severely harm diversification attempts. We all know it's primarily for economic reasons, other wise there's no way it would be worth pissing off a lot of people in the union that don't want it built. 

Regardless, I think it's important to see that as a smaller nation basically dependant on Germany for foreign policy(diplo and military), that it's easier and rational to take a harder stance. In general Germany should be more assertive when it comes to foreign policy.

It's also that Germany getting the NS2 will threaten other countries energy security and independence. 

All, I'm saying is while Germans are preaching solidarity about refugees(clusterfuck situation all across the board) and smaller countries are scared about Russia(a major threat) I think that's a decent reason why countries are skeptical of Germany's leadership on foreign policy when it comes to hard power.

Yes, the economic pain will probably be bad, but Russia and China teaming up, USA going AWOL and UK leaving, it's obvious the geopolitical situation is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.

&gt;
&gt;What‚Äôs wrong with a free market? Shouldn‚Äôt good businesses thrive without government aid? Why should the government step in to fix issues when a free market (supposedly) corrects itself? 

Do you think the free market always corrects issues? The market needs smart regulation, not all markets are free, and what I was talking about goes beyond where I think you're looking - such as the government adjusting legislation to allow for driverless cars. That's not really one that the market can dictate, at least not within our current legislative structure. 

&gt;And ‚Äòas much as possible‚Äô could lead to some pretty dark stuff. I‚Äôd argue supporting workers‚Äô unions would be better for the citizenry than sending in police as strike breakers. Our government has ‚Äòhelped business‚Äô that way before. 

You're really strawmanning me here. Maybe I'm not being clear, but when I say as much as possible I mean as much as possible without leading to other detrimental effects. IE enable businesses to thrive (as much as possible) by creating an environment where they can grow.

&gt;And, looking at people as primarily workers and consumers is a pretty dark (if accurate) way of valuing human life.

I don't think so, I think it's pragmatic. Look I'm on my phone here, and it's an abstract/simplified way of explaining things that makes a point - and I even said it was over simplified. Life is essentially a process of have need&gt;fulfill need&gt;repeat ad nauseum&gt;die. Primitive bands of humans rose up to help each other, then tribes and societies yada yada, all in order to support each other. I don't farm, so I can do something else and trade my services/goods I produce/currency to the guy who farms and in return we both are happier and have more than before. This is business, and on large scale it's the economy. That's a good thing, and at huge scale like in developed nations it needs to be fostered by regulatory agencies or it doesn't grow and thrive as well as if it's just an anachronistic barter system with zero management.

1372,"&gt;Could you possibly say something more ignorant and pretentious?

You ask that, then you follow up with:

&gt;Your argument can be easily dismissed as worthless trash written by an opinionated teenager who had been brainwashed by political propaganda.

Sorry, but to believe that slavery was just a secondary concern in the civil war requires you to reject literally every declaration of secession published by a seceding state (one of which managed to say ""slave"" or ""slavery"" 39 times in a 2-page document), and everything said by any Confederate leader on the subject.  Plus it requires you to forget everything about the south.  We're talking about states (example: South Carolina) in which the majority of the population was enslaved.  Slavery was absolutely the cornerstone of their society, their economy and their way of life.  It could not possibly have been a secondary issue to them.

Plus, it requires obliviousness to the national politics at the time, which was characterized by extreme polarization between defendants and opponents of slavery.  Slavery was THE political issue of the time.  The main crises, i.e. Bleeding Kansas, the Kansas/Nebraska Act, the Missouri Compromise, the Fugitive Slave Act, Harper's Ferry, etc., etc., were all about slavery.  Senator Charles Sumner was beaten almost to death on the floor of the Senate by Senator Preston Brooks, and the issue wasn't tariffs, it was slavery.  The partisanship was so extreme that Congress was forced to implement gag rules on the subject. Everyone in the 1850s could see that the issue would soon break up the union.  Lincoln said it himself in his House Divided speech in the 1850s, and he was only giving voice to popular sentiment.  Thomas Jefferson and John Adams both predicted it around 1820.  Everyone saw it coming.

&gt;He never was and never would be an Abolitionist as for an Abolitionist the idea that slavery could be - even temporarily - allowed to protect a political union (whch was Lincoln's strong view) was abhorrent.

That's certainly the radical point of view.  But most people favored legal abolition, as opposed to a bloody war in which millions fought and countless died.  The only legal path to abolition was a constitutional amendment, hence the position taken by Lincoln and other moderate Republicans, which was to forbid the expansion of slavery into new states and territories, thus paving the way for an amendment.

1378,"This article is a spot on. Czechia abroad and within portraits itself as a successful country that managed a transformation from a centrally planned economy, and everyone has prospered. However, within the country, there is a significant segment of people who are working poor. For these people, salaries are very minimal, social mobility is difficult, and the government under pretense of laissez faire economy does not care about them. This reflects with a very low political participation and one of the lowest voter turnaround in the EU. People in that demographic do not vote, the politicians do not care about their plight, and they are marginalized, living at the edge of the society, and seldom seen. For foreigners, who only see fixed historic cities do not see it, and so does the Czech majority. Yet, anyone can venture to outskirts of large cities or small, forgotten cities and villages from Moravian-Silesia to northwestern Bohemia, and will see a wide-spread poverty and society stuck in the 60s. 

However, I would emphasize that the poverty is not something that appeared after 1989. There was widespread poverty in Czechoslovakia under the communist regime. The problem was so prevalent that in the 60s there were numerous documentaries produced by relatively free media to address this issue. Around 1966 it was estimated that about 0.5 million of adults in Czechoslovakia lived on subsistence living. Novotny wanted these reports banned. Eventually, under Husak, the censorship made illegal mentioning poverty. For the next 20 years, an entire generation grew up in idea that poverty was not there. Slums in Prague were depicted as a temporary garden community (Jarov, Slatina, Old Pankrac,...), or many poors were moved into the border regions in the 60s and 70s. This unsolved social issues eventually became a larger social problem without any resolution after 1989.",,/r/europe/comments/9h3apr/if_the_czech_economy_is_thriving_why_are_we_so/e6aqdri/,kaik1914,1537414096

1421,"Could you possibly say something more ignorant and pretentious?

Your argument can be easily dismissed as worthless trash written by an opinionated teenager who had been brainwashed by political propaganda.

Lincoln's view on slavery does not matter because Lincoln was not an Abolitionist, as in: a member of a political minority active in the North who worked actively toward abolition of slavery and just restitution to the slaves as their main, defining political aim. Abolitionists were people who - correctly - recognized that slavery is the biggest issue and threat to American ideals and focused on that. People like Lincoln who being selfish crooks had no ethical backbone that wasn't paid for by donors did not even bother to understand how the very existence and tolerance of slavery was a problem that could harm American public life. And we know today that they were right and Lincoln was wrong.

He never was and never would be an Abolitionist as for an Abolitionist the idea that slavery could be - even temporarily - allowed to protect a political union (whch was Lincoln's strong view) was abhorrent. It was like saying ""that Hitler guy is bad, but at least we have peace for our time.""

The reason why today hypocrites pretend that Lincoln was anti-slavery is simple. He wasn't in a way that is ethical, while there were people who were.  That prevents the Union from being the ""good guys"" because they did not fight the war for just and ethical reasons. The abolition of slavery only happened to align with northern interest. What didn't align was the restitution to freed slaves which some people actually tried (look up Sherman's actions in Georgia) but the Union government stepped in and prevented that which led to the current racial debacle in America.

Lincoln was a Whig and argued against slavery on political grounds as it represented a competing economic interest to those he represented - of free white men and business interests being threatened by unfree labour. In a way he defended wage slavery as opposed to real slavery.  His sponsors were banking and heavy industry - hardly the ethical branches of civil society. He was not opposed to the idea of slavery existing in the southern states on principle because then he would be an ardent Abolitionist and that was an *unpopular* view in the North at the time.

The South seceded because Republican electoral victory meant that they lost the majority in the government and thus would no longer be able to maintain advantageous policies including resisting the push for more tariffs.

Before the war South provided an overwhelming majority of tax revenue to the federal budget. In a sense South financed the federal government so that it would provide a political entity to protect their interests as happened in the Revolutionary war which was fought more to protect slavery than to protect northern colonies' independence.

The reason why South declared slavery as the reason for secession was political. They had to use something that could be seen by the population as a threat and nobody is arguing that Southern society was fair and just and did not run on exploitation of a racially-defined group of people.

In other words I am arguing from the position of a Northern Abolitionist and point out that Lincoln was a fraud, a crook, a racist, a slavery-coddler and anyone who thinks him different is either an ignorant fool or  a lying scumbag who can't accept that he is not as good as he imagines himself to be.

But it is very common in America which in terms of mentality is the heir of the South far more than of Northern Abolitionism. 

It is up to you to decide which side of history you are on. If you are on Lincoln's side then there's no difference between you and the likes of Davis. Your opinions are only different because you want yourself to be better than others, not because you actually strive for ethical stances in the world.

1461,"Solar panels lose at least 0.5%  of their energy generation each year and average lifespans of turbines is less than 15 years. Depending on how insurance is handled nuclear is cheaper and has a lower carbon footprint, not even accounting for the space needed and how that would influence local wildlife, forests etc.  The levelised cost of energy puts nuclear as a cheaper option than most forms of energy,even solar depending on region and again I emphasis depending on how insurance is handled. France handles the insurance on a governmental level, which some may see as a subside. In 2011 France payed 50 euro per MWh because of State-covered insurance costs, in 2018 Electricite De France quotes 60 euro per MWh for new plants,lower if build in bulk. You can buy reactors abroad. KEPCO builds state of the art nuclear power plants for cheap  (their latest build is Barakah nuclear power plant, on budget and on time). And then there is china: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2015/10/22/china-shows-how-to-build-nuclear-reactors-fast-and-cheap

Kepco with 3 and 10% discount rate gives a rate of 29 to 51 $/MWh.

Far more realistic costs are in this report from IEA: https://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/pubs/2015/7057-proj-costs-electricity-2015.pdf. Despite all the regulation nuclear is the cheapest option for many countries https://i.imgur.com/Wyh9Lik.png

Report for Ontario, Canada from Fraser Institute - Rising Electricity Costs and Declining Employment in Ontario‚Äôs Manufacturing Sector, and summary for costs: https://i.imgur.com/YVaBxTF.png . It puts nuclear at around 66 $/MWh.


https://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/voices/energetics/taking-a-look-at-lazards-levelized-cost-estimates

Here's a researcher from the break through institute looking and comparing the numbers between studies.

The wind prices quoted in the report by LAZARD, the most favorable report to wind and solar(mainly because they invest in wind and solar and have been found to misrepresent nuclear tech by using only 1 type of reactor and quoting the price and costs which come up the first time it was build, 4 other reports by legitimate organizations contradict their findings, namely the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, International Energy Agency and Energy Information Administration) are for wind capacities of 45-55%, higher than most places will ever get or that their Solar- Crystaline utility assumes a tracking system and 30% capacity factor, which BTW almost no one in Europe gets. Renewables in the report are enjoying some unrealistic capacity factors, where reality CF is more like: UK 30% wind capacity factor, germany 21% wind and 10% solar capacity factor. China 23% wind, solar 18%, US 35% for wind. Or how about this little * they add

&gt; Certain Alternative Energy generation technologies are cost-competitive with conventional generation technologies under some scenarios

&gt; Analysis excludes integration (e.g., grid and conventional generation investment to overcome system intermittency) costs for costs for intermittent technologies.

The thing with renewables is the GRID upgrades needed to support the fluctuation in power generation. Really do look into German Wind power plant excess. Basically they build more Wind parks than they can use. The grid cannot take the power surges, and companies need to stop their production at peak wind conditions (up to 69% in some weather). Currently the German Wind and Solar market is worth 100 billion euro.While the grid would need an investment of 500 billion ‚Ç¨ to withstand the current fluctuations it produces. And here we are not even speaking of the General Grid enhancement Germany needs to Link north and south as well as east and west Germany.

http://www.herbert.saurugg.net/2017/blog/stromversorgung/stromnetz-kurz-vor-dem-zusammenbruch

The second shows the horrors of production the grid faces. Those power graphs are a nightmare for grid stability to maintain. And yes, they did think of batteries. They made the largest battery complex in the world. A whole building full of batteries to somewhat help a small portion of the grid, but not really. 

This study: http://www.world-nuclear.org/uploadedFiles/org/WNA/Publications/Working_Group_Reports/comparison_of_lifecycle.pdf

Puts the Co2 tonnes per GW for solar as 85 vs the 29 for nuclear. If we take that to account nuclear becomes very competitive. The prices shift towards nuclear if you have an adequate carbon tax.

Nuclear plant can work for 60+ years for old nuclear and 80 even 100 years for newer designs, with the possibility of increasing capacity as seen in the US, Finland, Spain, Sweden and others. 

Generation IV reactors are just around the corner and it would make nuclear even better and safer than it is now. Maybe Europe should invest in this venture AND renewebles. I'm for both but think we need nuclear as a base.

1464,"&gt; Absolutely off the mark. Subsidies are in national interest and can sustain or fuel strategic industry, among other things. Everybody does this, only hardcore globalists are against it, though that brand is well represented in Brussels or London. The shark type of dudes hope they can strong arm the other countries asymmetrically.

I didn't talk about subsidies, actually I'm against free trade. Countries don't have the same strengths, you can't let light weight competing on the same term in heavy weight competition. Also globalization fuels pollution like hell.

&gt; As for tech transfers, you didn't pick a wide enough viewpoint, only focusing on companies abroad while it goes much further in that it both lifts a huge chunk of humanity out of misery and comes back around in the form of foreign investment and science. It was well played from China, they and their population greatly benefited from it.

""Well played you stole work of others by exploiting greed"". I think you got to check your morality, thievery and bribery is not something to encourage.

&gt; but what goes around comes around through scientific community and industrial spying and reverse engineering, and State subsidies at home aimed at sustaining the resulting increase in competition where necessary. The more people on tech worldwide the faster it advances, and more competition only pushes this forward.

Until one nation comes ahead and eat others. There's no such thing as an united humanity currently, this is dangerously naive to think it's ok to give tech freely (it's the same thing as the no-borders idiotic thing). Part of a success of companies lies on its tech.

&gt; Europe by being too open has had its tech sector owned by the US along with a bunch of others including strategic assets. It was an ideological choice to let this happen instead of figuring out a robust way to get both foreign companies to settle and level our own companies at the same time.

You can thanks WW 2 for that. Also there's a good part of that ideology that is called greed and corruption.

1466,"Question: gas is just one type of fossil fuel. If supply security of gas is really such a concern, wouldn't it make sense to diversify? My aunt in the USA uses heating oil to keep warm in winter. I also hear that the USA is exporting a lot of oil so that could be helpful. There's also propane or LPG which we mostly use for cooking. Biomass could be good as an alternative source for heating that won't make the climate-conscious EU unhappy but it'll only cover a fraction at best. Then there's geothermal heating like in Iceland.

Another idea would be to switch to electric heating (preferably heat pumps for keeping warm). If building more power plants is off the table, some things can be done. Unfortunately, I hear the EU will not be happy with Poland burning more coal for this extra electricity. Importing electricity is an option but it may not provide very much. Eight now, I think Poland's net import of electricity is more or less zero so there's some room to import electricity from countries it's already connected with. Then there's putting up wind turbines in the Baltic Sea where the wind is stronger than on land. It's also windier in the winter months and that's the time you need energy for heat.

French people after WW1 didn't want to fight, French people after WW2 didn't want to fight, there wouldn't have been a civil war no matter who took the power. If the Resistance claimed the power, instead of De Gaulle himself, it wouldn't have lead to a civil war nor would it have lead to a British or American invasion... but the communist of the resistance believed in De Gaulle and when they realized he didn't share their political ideas, after the first election of the 4th Republic, it was already too late for them, '45 or even '46 France could have easily turned communist, '48 France was asking for stability, peace and nothing else, '48 communists in particular in the south west of France had already fought two wars, the Spanish Civil War and then the Resistance during WW2, they did not have the energy for a third one immediately after.

1567,"&gt;This is frequently brought up as a counter argument, but it actually isnt. We are talking about crime today. Crime today would drop dramatically without Migrants. 

&gt;It doesnt matter that it is at its lowest. There were days in world war 2 when only 10 000 people died, surely its lowest since 39 but still far too high. 

&gt;My point still stands. No migrants = Lower Crime Rate.

Sure, my point was that the migration since 1992 has not increased crimes rates at all, so even if crime rates dropped (of course they would, you would have less people) the inmigrants are not having a significant effect right now in the crimes rates, or at the very least their impact is severely smaller. 

&gt;Assault and Gang Rapes are a new phenomenon that was basically non existent in Germany. Also Migrants are massively overrepresented in the rape statistics. In some cities rape went up 300% due to the migrant influx. 

&gt;Again, my point is valid. Less migrants, less rapes.

The data I found by googling 5 minutes don't show a ""massive overrepresentation"" as you claimed. I mentioned and linked those data, but anyway.

&gt;You dont have to, because it is actually very simple. If only a single migrant is on welfare, deporting him would mean welfare spending decreases. If only a single migrant child is in a school class, deporting it would mean smaller classes. If only a single migrant occupies a flat or home deporting him would mean more free homes for Germans, subsequently less demand, prices would come down etc.

The reasons why I am skeptical:

1. There are studies showing most inmigrant are net contributors to the welfare system. 

2. Politicians would probably keep the same pupil/teacher ratio if you kicked inmigrants in order to cut costs. I doubt you would have more funds per pupil, just as I don't believe Leave.eu's ""¬£350 million for the NHS each week"". 

3. I doubt the rising housing market is driven by inmigrants buying homes, most likely it's hedge/investment funds speculating and wealthier Germans doing so. If anything, because they actually have the money to spend in a nice Berlin suburb house. 

&gt;I dont know why some people think it is acceptable to have, lets say 20% of all welfare recipients to be migrants, or 20% of a class be migrants. In any case, they take something away from the indeginous population. Even if there is only a single migrant.

Honestly, as long as they pay their taxes, learn the language and basic culture and respect the law, I don't care. 20% of German residents are from inmigrant origin, it is normal 20% recipients of welfare or education will be of inmigrant origin. 

&gt;So GDP goes down. So some transnational corporation doesnt get as much money. Who actually cares? Why should the German people pay for migrants again? So some corporations get rich? So the GDP is high? What for?

&gt;Again, why is this something bad again? So Monsanto doesnt make billions in Germany anymore. Wow, what a shocker. Whats next, Apple not selling enough Iphones? Only worth 900 billions instead of a trillion? 

&gt;GDP is an arbitrary number. No one cares if it is high, no once cares if it is low. No one can explain why Germans(or any other country for that matter) should suffer under migrants just for a number to be high or some investors making cash.

I am not sure you understand that it is German workers (as in, ethnic German workers) who build BMW, VW, Daimler, etc. cars. That German steel is smelted by German workers, in German factories, to support German families. 

So you should care about a drop of 20% GDP or leaving your main market (the EU), because both things will invariably send MANY people to unemployment. This is not about corporate profits, this is about the people who earn a living thanks to the things they produce, and the people who can earn a living thanks to those industry workers earning a living. 

Also, you do know that corporations have this nasty tendency to pass on the costs of economic crisis down to the workers, right? So you laugh at corporation X losing profits, but that would undoubtedly mean thousands of people losing their job. A loss of 20% of the workforce/GDP would probably cause the worst economic crisis in Germany since the end of WW2, and I am not sure there would be a ""German miracle"" this time around. 

And again: those inmigrants are there because the German economy can hold them, because there are jobs for them. Sure, wages would be higher in some sectors if they weren't there, but you would have a gap of 20% of your workforce. That means bankruptcy for many.

&gt;Who is this 500 million market for? The Germans? No, corporations and companies. Who pays for the EU? The german tax payer. Why should he pay so companies can have access to other countries again? What does he get by doing so? Migrants making his life worse?

Again, German workers have a job thanks to Germany's status as a powerhouse in Europe and abroad. But anyway...

1578,"When I say that it would have lead to a ""British or American invasion"", what I'm saying is that I assume that if the communists took power in France then they would have to get rid of democracy and create a dictatorship. There have been no democratic communist countries and I do not believe that communists governments can exist with democracy. If they allowed democracy then French people would just vote back in a non-communist government once the communists killed the economy and started seizing property. I also assume they would have been propped up the USSR. There was never a chance that France would actually practice communism. Even if the communists won an election they would just lose the next election once they started messing up the economy.

&amp;#x200B;

In that case the US and UK definitely would have invaded France. We already had troops in France at the time. The moment they got rid of democracy it would have been easy to. There would also have been large numbers of non-communist French units that would be there with us, like De Gaulle, (who was not communist at all).

&amp;#x200B;

The French Army was like non-existent in 1945. It has no ships, few aircraft, and few tanks. Almost all of the equipment they had at the time was stuff that the US had given to them. While at the same time we had millions of troops in Europe and more tanks and aircraft than even the Soviets had. We had millions of more men fighting the Japanese in Asia who would have returned to Europe. Plus the USSR would have had no way to supply a communist government in France. It would have been really easy to remove a communist government from France once they started rigging elections or curtailing democracy.  They had no army to speak of in 1946 and much of what French army there was would defect to the non-communists. to the US/UK.

Modern divisions of the language are mostly a product of d2d politics of the last 50 years, while historically the thing is so complicated it's not even worth starting the discussion here on reddit.

If I have understood correctly the Bengali famine wasn't an intentional campaign of extermination although the British can certainly be accused of many mistakes which exacerbated it. The victims of the Soviet purges were undeniably killed because of government policy. If we want to talk about government responses to famine I would compare the Bengali famine to the Ukrainian famine in the 1930's which (you would probably say) may not have been an intentional genocide. But actions by the Soviet government did make it much worse through forced collectivisation and terror. I doubt that British callousness in India exceeded the Soviet callousness in Ukraine.

Hungary decided to say: ""I don't agree with this vote, I refuse to agree to the consensus. My opinion matters more than any of yours, hence I won't bow to the consensus.""

That's really what that topic boils down to. You can't enter a group that relies on consensus and then put your own interest above the group consensus while also wanting that the group just accepts your dissent and moves on.

The EU wanted to redistribute a total of 120000 asylum seekers from Italy, Greece and Hungary across the EU. Hungary (which would have been able to redistribute 54000 of asylum seekers in Hungary) decided to vote against it because the deal included Hungary having to take 1294 asylum seekers. [[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_migrant_quota_referendum,_2016#Background)]

Hungary literally said ""Fuck all of you, I'd rather keep the 54000 people we don't want here to avoid having to take 1294.""

&gt; Are you admitting you¬¥d happily vote for nazis?

No I am not voting for NSDAP or NPD but I could maybe vote for AfD with a couples of thousand racists inside and within their voter base in the future.

&gt; Well then show me too please

If you haven't seen that happen yourself we are living in totally different realities anyway. The Green party has made my energy cost and other expenses explode with bad policy. The 1968s have crept the evil of marxism inside schools and other institutions. Greens and anticapitalists both want to destroy the car industry, energy sector and other industries that are base of our wealth. They hurt policemen when protesting illegally at ""Hambacher Forst"" after they have been given fluffy treatment and allowed everything for years. And they are actually acting against the Law and against the State and have hordes of supporters who don't care about that. When the RAF murdered peoples they had Hordes of supporters too and the State almost surrendered to their bullies on multiples occasions. They were wrong as well when they protested against Reagan and his measures which ended the cold war (together with even more important Gorb.). And I have seen the same ideological naivety, nihilism and hatred of western civilisation in my personal life and no I won't give you video evidence. And I don't want to bash the Marxists its the other side who is using the violence. And you will say Nazis did worse back in 45 and you are right but they aren't in power and the AfD aren't them.
I am pretty sure we come to totally different conclusions anyway but I guess now you know where I stand. 

&gt; If it hurts you so much

Yes it hurts being falsely called Nazi without any evidence it can be very effective. 
Lets say I would show my face at one of those protests like day 1 Chemnitz for examples and have totally decent opinions about restricting economic migration and securing borders while keeping asylum and still being nice to foreigners and disavowing all racial ideology.
I could still be singled out by large media, framed as nazi sympathizer, stupid hater and whatever and targeted by other smaller leftwing organizations and might in the end maybe even loose my job or have other disadvantages.
Some of that are reasons why many middle class conservatives are rarely seen on street protests (there are many other reasons of course like psychological etc) because the ""Nazikeule"" has been very effective in the past.
I guess I have to restrict myself to words and maybe sending money to institutions and acting in my personal environment and leave the public activism to peoples who got less to loose.

This less democratic section of the EU is a crack in the EU's foundations. However, there is no way to correct these rules and thus the EU is flawed compared to what most people view as an ideal EU.

Not a question, but wanted to say I watched the interview you did for Mind at a work function and was very moved.

I really appreciate you putting yourself in the spotlight by pushing for a second referendum - especially as it is not a particularly popular opinion with a huge swathe of the voting public.

Although I am hugely anti-brexit, I have concerns of the impact of a 2nd referendum - if remain win, it will fuel the far right who will fee cheated. If remain lose, it will fuel the far right who will feel vindicated.

Creating and sharing a meme - to address this stupid propaganda - is clearly allowed under EU copyright laws and a movie still with some text on top is also easily differentiatable from the actually copyrighted movie.

1907,"&gt;You pretend that you are disagreeing with ""an opinion piece"" while you are disagreeing with the scientific community of political science. Just do a quick literature search on populism on Google scholar, and you'll find that this is the accepted definition.

This is an appeal to authority, and a bad one at that. Firstly, why does the opinions of someone become fact simply because they have a political science degree? It doesn't. The paper you linked demonstrates that this idea is purely based on the mere political opinions of these people. Their political opinoins do not matter, at least not if the paper you linked is any indication of the level of reasoning they use to justify their ideas! This is nothing but a bad appeal to authority because never have they demonstrated that they should have any authority on this subject.

&gt;It's not hard finding examples of current populists and their rhetoric, even though they might not proclaim themselves as such. Here is Wilders, literally tweeting ""the people are cheated by the elite again!"" 

This is circular reasoning, ""they are populists because they have these populist opinions, and these opinions are populist because populists are spouting them"". This is a fallacy. 

If the political science community cannot produce a good justification for why this should be changed, no one should respect their opinion on the subject. I have provided you with many arguments as to why this is a bad idea. It controls language and dumbs down conversation by removing important concepts from the dictionary, and creating an unfair vector of attack and misrepresentation for those who want to use the words in their original meaning.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/9h33n7/splitting_wedges/e69a27a/,mmmmph_on_reddit,1537368368

1918,"I have to say it's a strange democracy given that it rules over millions of people in the West Bank and Gaza yet doesn't give them a right to vote (whereas the Jewish settlers in the West Bank do). That seems about as much a democracy as apartheid South Africa was with its Bantustans.

&gt;Israel is a democracy and therefore should be peaceful and should not protect itself. /s

Israel has as much right to security or to defend itself as the Palestinians or its neighbouring countries do. But somehow, despite its military and the fact that it is the only country in the region with WMD (that have never been inspected), its security concerns always trump those of the Palestinians or neighbouring countries.

&gt;Hamas wants to eliminate one country, but doesn't have a problem with the other one is irrelevant. 

Hamas does want to destroy Israel as reflected in its charter. Yet given Israel's military might, such thinking is more fanciful than anything. Besides, behind closed doors both sides negotiate with each other (including prisoner exchanges and truces). Hamas is also far from friendly towards Egypt given that its Muslim Brotherhood comrades are now behind bars, have been murdered or are being tortured there.

For the record, plenty of Israelis want to make a Palestinian state impossible or ultimately ethnic cleanse them from the land. Netanyahu and many prominent politicians have sworn to make such a state impossible and are actively putting facts on the ground to make it so. There is a highly active campaign to colonise the West Bank, building settlements for Jews only on Arab land in complete violation of international law.

1935,"To be honest, I'm having a hard time following your logic using the analogy you use at the very end. But I'll do my best. 

You seem to agree with me that Greece, Italy, and Portugal (and probably a number of other countries (looking at you, France)) should never have been allowed to build their houses in the neighbourhood to begin with, because they violated the building codes. Probably some people knew about this at the time, but hey, the more the merrier, so water under the bridge, right?

As a result, the houses they built and that were supposed to be fire-proofed caught flame through a freak accident that occurred a few years after they moved in. The other tenants who invested heavily to ensure their places were equipped with insurances and safeguards all jumped in, and have been helping to try and prevent the houses of the newcomers from being utterly consumed by fire. After all, having one or more of these houses fall to the fire would give off a bad impression of the neighbourhood, right? They also all agreed that the owners of the burning houses would pay back the water used over time.

We're now many years further, and no payback ever occurred. Sure, the inhabitants of the burning houses have given back some of the the water used, whenever they received more water from the neighbourhood, but the fires are still slumbering, and they would still be SOL if the fire for whatever reason would start raging again. Except that when that happens, other houses might also catch fire, which might cause yet other houses to get in the danger zone. The water supply of the neighbourhood as a whole has been weakened, and the next time there might not be enough water to save everyone.

1937,"In recient history (ie, Post Franco), the very first prime minister, [Adolfo Su√°rez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolfo_Su%C3%A1rez), is usually considered the best, mostly for guiding Spain through turbulent times and transforming it into a modern democracy.

&amp;#x200B;

In older history I'd say [Charles I (or V for the Holy Roman Empire)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) is usually considered the best king, the one who took the Spanish Empire to its ceiling. His successor, [Philip II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain) is considered just as good although a bit too warmonger (which in the long run would lead to the decline of the Spanish Empire).

&amp;#x200B;

21st century:   ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø So far probably PM Zapatero or king Philip VI but there is still plenty of time to do much better than that.

20th century: Adolfo Su√°rez

19th century: Tie between Alfonso C√°novas and Mateo Sagasta (you can't really understand one without the other). No real good choices here though but they were the least bad I guess

18th century: Charles III

17th century: Philip III. No real good choices here though, but he was the least bad I guess.

16th century: Charles I

15th century: Tie between the 2 ""Catholic kings"" (Isabella of Castille, Ferdinand of Aragon)

Not matter how vehemently you defend the administration, no rational people will believe what it says given its track record of lying 100% of the time.

2017,"&gt;This is a very recent and top-down attempt of trying to change the meaning of the word into something it isn't.

It depends on what you mean with recent. In political science research this definition of populism has been in use since at least the seventies. See for example this highly cited article from the political science research that discusses the definition of populism, which appeared in 1968: [http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/lists/bibliography/bib111bLSE.pdf](http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/lists/bibliography/bib111bLSE.pdf)

&gt;Last decade when governments and media corporations have tried to make it into a bad word.

No, it's researchers from the political science community who came up with this definition. My previous comment even stated this.

&gt;Why even try to change the meaning of the word populism when a word already exist for that concept (demagoguery)?

Demagoguery is a much broader concept, defined as ""gaining popularity by exploiting prejudice and ignorance among the common people"". Populism definitely is demagoguery, but not all demagoguery is populism. In the populist form of demagoguery, the ""prejudice and ignorance"" of the definition of demagoguery concerns the false perception of ""the people"" versus ""the elite"" and the false believe in ""the populist providing the people with protection from the elite"".

*invasion* is wrongly used by many to describe the current immigration issue. it carries a whole load of underlying emotional meaning (remember the definition of populism?)

however, ""invasion"" is a military operation. also it requires a preexisting general plan or agenda, a specific goal and a certain level of cooperation and organisation .

in this case we are talking about personal initiative of hundreds of thousands of people. *personal initiative* and *invasion* are mutually exlusive. their motives vary from physical security, social security, hunger, economic pressure and so on. also there is no agenda or hidden goal. also there is no high level organisation.

otherwise, the mass immigration the US had 100 years ago would have been an ""invasion"", for instance.

In practice, specially in this century, it has more to do with finding overly simplistic ""solutions"" that do not function and, often times, are detrimental.

2270,"The Trump administration is a stage 3 or 4 fascist government.

&gt; In his 1998 paper ""The Five Stages of Fascism,"" he suggests that fascism cannot be defined solely by its ideology, since fascism is a complex political phenomenon rather than a relatively coherent body of doctrine like communism or socialism. Instead, he focuses on fascism's political context and functional development. The article identifies five paradigmatic stages of a fascist movement, although he notes that only Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy progressed through all five:

&gt;1. Intellectual exploration, where disillusionment with popular democracy manifests itself in discussions of lost national vigor
2. Rooting, where a fascist movement, aided by political deadlock and polarization, becomes a player on the national stage
3. Arrival to power, where conservatives seeking to control rising leftist opposition invite the movement to share power
4. Exercise of power, where the movement and its charismatic leader control the state in balance with state institutions such as the police and traditional elites such as the clergy and business magnates.
5. Radicalization or entropy, where the state either becomes increasingly radical, as did Nazi Germany, or slips into traditional authoritarian rule, as did Fascist Italy.

2348,"The Black Book of Communism is widely discredited today and one of the authors admitted to inflate numbers to get the 100 million. In any case, it's intellectually dishonest accounting and false statistics which are at work here, as it accounts for people dying from diseases, war and even old age. For example, the number for the USSR accounts for casualties in the Civil War (listed as ""Killed by the government""). Only the fewest amount of them was actually killed actively by Soviet state actors, an amount probably lower than 500.000 in Russia. To give [one source that works with multiple accountings](https://mltheory.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/austin-murphy-the-triumph-of-evil.pdf):

&gt;The claim that Stalin and other Soviet leaders killed millions (Conquest,
1990) also appears to be wildly exaggerated. More recent evidence
from the Soviet archives opened up by the anticommunist Yeltsin
government indicate that the total number of death sentences (including
of both existing prisoners and those outside captivity) over the
1921-1953 interval (covering the period of Stalin's partial and complete
rule) was between 775,866 and 786,098 (Getty, Rittersporn, and Zemskov,
1993). Given that the archive data originates from anti-Stalin (and
even anticommunist) sources, it is extremely unlikely that they underestimate
the true number (Thurston, 1996). In addition, the Soviet Union
has long admitted to executing at least 1 2,733 people between 1917 and
1921, mostly during the Foreign Interventionist Civil War of 191 8-22,
although it is possible that as many as 40,000 more may have been
executed unofficially (Andics, 1 969). These data would seem to imply
about 800,000 executions.
The figure of 800,000 may greatly overestimate the number of actual
executions, as it includes many who were sentenced to death but who
were not actually caught or who had their sentences reduced (Getty, Rittersporn,
and Zemskov, 1993). In fact, Vinton ( 1993) has provided evidence
indicating that the number of executions was significantly below
the number of civilian prisoners sentenced to death in the Soviet Union,
with only 7305 executions in a sample of 1 1 ,000 prisoners authorized
to be executed in 1940 (or scarcely 600/o ). 

And about GULag:

&gt;Like the myths of millions of executions, the fairy tales that Stalin
had tens of millions of people arrested and permanently thrown into
prison or labor camps to die in the 1 930-53 interval (Conquest, 1990)
appear to be untrue. In particular, the Soviet archives indicate that the
number of people in Soviet prisons, gulags, and labor camps in the
1 930s, 1 940s, and 1 950s averaged about 2 million, of whom 20-40%
were released each year, (Getty, Rittersporn, and Zemskov, 1 993). This
average, which includes desperate World War II years, is similar to the
number imprisoned in the USA in the 1 990s (Catalinotto, 1 998a) and is
only slightly higher as a percentage of the population. 

The ""65 million"" in China is also an insane fantasy number. Population did grow in China during the Mao era and sometimes statistics accounting for people moving to the cities [were listed as dead](https://monthlyreview.org/commentary/did-mao-really-kill-millions-in-the-great-leap-forward/). To compare it with the Nazis, they actively exterminated people with gas chambers and mass execution.

Even if we accept this number: Capitalism kills 25 million *per year*. So it would only take 5 years for capitalism to reach this level of death toll - not even talking about all the lives socialist states have saved from hunger, homelessness, war and illiteracy.",,/r/europe/comments/9gxaal/walmart_to_halt_sales_of_shirts_featuring_soviet/e68r3ts/,XasthurWithin,1537340518

2384,"I don't really disagree with you, I'm just describing the general mindset of a big part of our population and political representatives. In a way it's understandable, I'd say this passive resistence of foreign authorities is largely what kept us alive as a nation, it's what prevented us from being assimilated throughout the centuries. Obviously the EU nowadays doesn't aim for the assimilation of national cultures into one big European cultures, but in the past when we were a relatively small group of Slavic people in a common political entity with larger and more powerful German speaking population, assimilation was a real threat. So we developed natural defense mechanisms to prevent it in our collective mentality.

Our modern history (20th century) also created a large sense of distrust of the big Western European powers like France and the UK, or I should probably say a big distrust in general towards international alliances. There was a period of optimism in the 90s and early 00s about the West, but that largely disappeared with the 2009 financial crisis when most people realized that we will not be catching up with the West economically any time soon and even more so with the migration crisis that questioned whether the western model of how to organize their societies is even desirable. And regardless of how desirable it is or not, the EU was seen as too intrusive in our internal affairs anyway.

So nowadays, the feelings towards Western Europe are kinda lukewarm and the natural response to that is to stick with our allies in the V4 more. So when people see that two of these allies have issues with the EU, from their perspective, it means that the EU is attacking them and so they get defensive of them (for all they know if the EU is now attacking Poland and Hungary, they can attack us next time).

And even people who do realize that Poland and Hungary are indeed doing wrong things domestically and that the criticisim from the EU is in fact largely deserved, they still don't agree with the method, they think it's too aggressive and too intrusive and that this is now how the member states in the EU should be treated.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/9gt9xe/lithuania_promises_to_not_support_the_eu/e68rgi1/,kristynaZ,1537341203

I only compared her to Italy. Italy had one significant enemy that she attacked on her own terms, at the time of her own choosing, on a well-defined theater and still managed to achieve nothing and only narrowly avoided complete collapse during the last year of the war. Cadorna himself outperformed the collective ineptitude of the entire A-H staff - ask any Italian, probably.

In comparison the A-H Empire, despite spectacular defeats - at Kolubara or Przemysl, or during the events leading to the Russian incursion in '15 - performed slightly better in a much more difficult situation. The Przemysl defeat basically relegated her to defensive operations for the entirety of the war. This being evident, the Empire was subjected to surprise declarations of war at least twice (or thrice, if the second Romanian declaration of war counts). Nevertheless, she did win the war against Russia (which ultimately amounted to nothing) and held her enemies right until the war being decided on the Western Front.

(The 'excuse' for the failure of the first invasion is, of course, stupidity and underestimation of the terrain and the Serbian Army's experience.

2546,"&gt;I'm not sure where you live or what your laws are, but I assure you that's not the case in the EU. The ECHR's not vague, and I imagine that European courts have a perfectly clear 'idea' of what those rights are, because everyone in the Europe has them.

I understand that we're the bad guys here because I'm in the US, but that's my point. The EU conception of human rights is not 100% in line with how we all understood human rights back in the 1940s. Like all EU countries can't execute people under the ECHR. That was not a thing in the 1940s when the Nuremberg Trials were happening and human rights as a concept were taking off. I'm not saying that we disagree completely, but like this Swedish example makes no sense to use, (and no sense to many Europeans). 



Israel won't actually torture or kill this guy who firebombed a mosque trying to kill jews inside of it.  He's not even a citizen, he's a foreigner who could be deported for just shoplifting. It's not like he's being sent to North Korea and y'all are all talking like this is a big deal. 


The way the the ECHR has expanded human rights is almost meaningless.You have no idea what's actually in human rights, it's not universal. Law is not a science and language in not absolute, the ECHR has interpreted many articles of the convention in ways that were inconceivable to the framers who wrote it.

2581,"Will EU regulators also launch probe against European Commission? Because [European Commission knew in 2011](https://global.handelsblatt.com/companies/european-commission-knew-of-vw-emissions-scandal-360363) about allegations that Volkswagen manipulated emissions tests. 4 years before US came out about it.

That EU Commission in [may this year](https://phys.org/news/2018-05-eu-germany-court-air-pollution.html) said they'll sue Germany and other countries over air pollution because of this. ""Because air pollution.""

Also Oliver Krischer from German Greens [claimed](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/11884877/German-government-knew-VW-was-rigging-emissions-test.html) that German government knew about all of this.    
And they probably knew. As well as others in EU.    
And it was known for long time. 
That can be supported by [Mr. Kageson](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/world/europe/volkswagen-scandal-highlights-european-stalling-on-new-emissions-tests.html), the Swedish researcher, who said that discrepancy between reality and laboratory test results was already so well known in the 1990s that he had expected quick steps in Europe to ‚Äúmake it much more difficult for manufacturers to beat the tests.‚Äù But nothing was done, at least not in Europe.

‚ÄúThere was great unwillingness among politicians and in the European Commission and, of course, resistance from manufacturers, who were very content with the existing system.‚Äù

So. German government covered known widespread criminal activities of German car industry since 1990s. Hey it's multi billion industry.
German transport minister Andreas Scheuer still [keeps his word on (cleanenergywire.org)](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/dieselgate-timeline-germanys-car-emissions-fraud-scandal), with no intend to increase government pressure on the car industry. Lovely.

Also others are there. French fraud investigators found that Renault's [entire management](https://phys.org/news/2017-03-renault-entire-implicated-pollution-fraud.html) was implicated in pollution tests fraud for 25 years. Also [Peugeot and Citroen](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39699294). And [others](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/01/french-inquiry-confirms-widespread-irregularities-in-diesel-emissions-data).

Likely. There wont be big investigation and charges about all of this widespread governments supported fraud and criminal activities.
Would you love some sanctions, articles, charges against Germany? France maybe? Nah.

&amp;nbsp;

Germany and others commit fraud for 25+ years. Nothing to see there.
Hungarians and Poles chose their own governments through regular elections. EU goes MAD.
Look out for that bad man, villain, Orban and them Poles.
I support criminal investigations and charges against Orban, and against, whoever should be taken that way in Poland. Or wherever.

But. Seeing again and again, this hypocrisy from Brussels. On one side they will sanction Hungary. On the other, they will tap German shoulder with probe from EU Commission, which already knew about all of this, like hey Germans they saw you, be more careful, right. Germans [suggested](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/reactions-eu-air-quality-lawsuit-100-renewables-possible-study/mixed-reactions-eu-decision-sue-germany-and-other-countries-over-air-pollution) that to EU Commission.

2587,"I apologize, I didn't realize you were French till I re-read an other comment you made on this thread. I had thought you were English for some reason which was why I was responding like that. 


I think France's relationship with the US was kind of complicated early on. The French monarchy had given the US support during the 1770s and 1780s, but then the King was executed during the French revolution. There were factions in the US at the time which supported France, but then there were other factions that thought our alliance was with the (executed) French king and that the new French government was crazy anyway. 

That said, the Marquis de LaFayette was always one of the most celebrated figures in US history back then and even today. We have named lots of cities and streets after him. He seemed to sort of be on the same page with the ideology we had back then. He was even more anti-slavery than we were, which we didn't become (nationwide) until like 60 years later. 

But yeah... I think that the French would have done the same thing to North America if they had had the power to. My family (and most colonial Americans) were religious minorities in England who the English allowed to emigrate to America in the 1600s, that's why there were so many English colonists. The French restricted Huguenot emigration and other dissenters which I think severely curtailed the number of French colonists. But I think in retrospect they would have done the same thing that we did. 

Napoleon actually sold Louisiana to the US in 1803 (he was in his bathtub when he sold it negotiating with American diplomats) because he realized that it was too late to populate the place with Frenchmen so he might as well get money from the US because he calculated that the US would take it anyway in a few decades (because so few French people live there while the US population was already multiple million people next door and Louisiana was mostly uninhabited).


Louisiana, where I'm from, actually used to be more like Quebec. The population there was kind of suspicious of the Americans when the US took over after 1803. Then what happened was there was a war with the UK in 1812, and a British Army invaded New Orleans in 1814. There was a big battle where the local Franco-militia and the American army beat the British down to a pulp and after that it was really easy to assimilate Louisiana into the US because we had both shed blood together against the British so they became much easier incorporated into American nationalism. (France had sold them to the US for money so they no longer felt loyal to france, but they had caught the Republican bug with the US and fighting with American troops) 

But seriously, I think the US and France are more similar than people realize. Same desire to have their place in the world, same driving forces. Both presidential systems, both republics, both countries have their history in their respective revolutions, etc... 

The way that French people think and feel about the French Revolution is very similar to how the US thinks about the American Revolution. We both have our similar mytholigies, which I think have served us well as a unifying factor for our nations",,/r/europe/comments/9gel0h/would_you_join_a_largescale_uprising_against_the/e68kbiq/,sandyhands2,1537330253

2599,"1. Yeah, but we can always raise taxes later or print more money. All our debt is denominated in our own currency, which we can print. Also, the US economy does not do a lot of trade as a percentage of our economy. The US is a big country which produces lots of stuff and is less vulnerable to trade shocks. Tariffs aren't that important to the US compared to smaller European countries which have cross multiple borders to trade with others 200 miles away. Anyway, I don't thin think the tariffs are that big. It's only on a few sectors like steel. There is no real big trade war coming.
2. We don't elect judges, they are nominated by the president and voted on by the senate. The new judge does not want to protect Trump. And he's only 1 judge out of 9. I think that's a serious misreading of American politics. He's had a career as a federal judge for many years already and is very well qualified. Judges are completely independent in the US, federal judges serve for life in order to make them independent.

I don't think Europeans understand what's gong on in the US. Trump is a populist, but we've had populist presidents before. He's the 45th consecutive president elected over the last 230 years. There are short term changes over that long a period of time.

secondly, you tried to counter me when i said anatolian ethnicity does not exist with phrygians, who are are of the many anatolian cultures, and the most different from the others. so what is the point of getting phrygians here? what are you trying to prove? 

as a side not, since phrygians who are dinstinct to other anatolians and certainly migrated there not very long before greeks migrated to anatolia, would you include greeks to indegenous anatolians too? at the very least they have been to anatolia for far longer, considering they never got extinct.",,/r/europe/comments/9guzkm/number_of_years_regions_of_greece_were_part_of/e67t15p/,cupid91,1537303791

Among them were Abdullah Azzam and Osama bin Laden. The political scientist wrote, citing ""military experts,"" that Sikorski helped the United States and the United Kingdom in financing the organization. For money from the West, among others to create training camps for fighters in Peshawar.

&amp;#x200B;

This is bunk. So you are telling me that an article was published citing ""military experts"" that the US and UK funded Maktab al-Khidamat aka Osama bin Laden? The organizaiton Maktab al-Khidamat raised money from mosques in numerous Western Countries and Arab countries, including the United States. The US government and the UK government didn't even know who bin Laden or Zawahiri were in the 1980s because they were nobodies. They were just rich Arab kids going to play jihad in Afghanistan who got money from wealthy muslim donation. (And most money from Bin Laden's own personal fortune because his father was a Saudi Billionaire)

You must admit that the financial crisis had a massive impact on middle class America that no American President can fix overnight so stop lumping in Trump with all previous governments. He is non-party.  

Now look at the EU as a comparison. Gvt's experienced major financial difficulties got through massive spending cuts in health, education &amp; policing and unlike the US services have returned to their pre crisis levels. Put this down to better global climate for business or ECB acting as a safeguard either way the tide has turned.

This could all be a ticking time bomb for the next bubble to burst rest assured though more people are in a position to deal with shocks than they are before and contrary to idle talk Pres Trump has not altered how America is run.

Yes, I have written as much. I don't see the French football club from Polynesia here; it's obvious: the map shows only a selection.

It is your reading of it as propaganda that I am quizzed by, especially in the context of how you elaborated on it (""The map shows Russia as a little outskirt with barely a few teams. In reality it is not the case. There is no explanation other than it is made deliberately as propaganda.""). Your explanation fails - to my eyes - to account for Turkish mainland clubs, or more northern Swedish (let's not forget √ñstersunds FK, or GIF Sundsvall! - with all due respect) or Norwegian clubs.

In a word: I know it's only natural to look at your local perspective (as we say in Polish - ""bli≈ºsza koszula cia≈Çu"", the shirt is closer to the body), but I think you may have overreacted with calling this propaganda, especially one that is aimed against Russia (this is my understanding of the gist of your stance). That said, thanks for the map of Russian clubs, it was interesting to catch a glance of the variety.

Stronger as in becoming a bigger economy (world's largest even), gaining legitimacy in representing the continent, keeping stability and peace on the continent, having more influence (this is especially visible in Ukraine and Georgia, where EU dreams have had powerful impact on the societies). Think of Poland now rivalling Russia in attracting workforce from Belarus and Ukraine, EU replacing Russia in Ukraine's trade partners, Romania managing to keep Russia's influence further away from Moldova etc. EU has become the dominating force on the continent, whereas without Eastern expansion, the continent could still be having some sort of a Cold War.

- Lithuania and Germany have different geopolitical interests and concerns
- Lithuania judge it to be better for them to support and be on good terms with Poland due to their geopolitical interests and concerns. This includes being a tiny nation, on the border with Russia, with Poland being their strongest nearby ally.
- Germany is not a tiny nation, is not on the border with Russia, and has other strong allies around it, so are not as reliant on Poland. They are prepared to damage relations with Poland by supporting sanctions against them.

Following still? Here's the clincher - Germany's relative security compared to Lithuania only applies to Germany, not to Lithuania also. So when discussing Lithuania's interests, Germany's judgement on Germany's interests is not equal to, you know... Lithuania's judgement of Lithuania's.

I simply invite you to read some history books and you'll see that most of bohemian kings even from the middle ages were germans or other ethnies but not ethnic czech, and it is the bohemians who elected a habsurg king in the first place. ELECTED. so their king being german has never been a problem at all, hell having a foreign king has never been a problem to croats and hungarns since they chose a foreigner as king. Actually croats and bohemians were supportive of the monarchy, they just wanted to be recognized at the same level as the hungarns

They aren't really supporting it. They are just protecting it from an utter isolation in the EU. As long as PiS still has things to lose, it will act somewhat productively and responsibly. Push them into corner and they might freak out really badly. And other countries in the region with them.

&gt; Wars are won with money. Poland has neither the army nor the money.

Wars are won with money AND the willingness to carry the losses. It's about both the physical capabilities but also the tolerance towards engaging in a military conflict and making sacrifices. Germany has enough money, but it's questionable how much willingness they have to engage in a military conflict with Russia.

Also, regadless of how strong Polan is in the hard power, Poland's cooperation is still very much needed due to their geographic position.

Not gonna happen. All of this may happen just in Russia‚Äôs wildest dreams, but it‚Äôs simply not a plausible scenario

Nukes do not have to be used on either side, neither Russia nor Western countries would want to use nukes over the Baltics anyway.

As for NATO and EU - it would not be the first time when military alliances were broken. Trump is a wild cald, he is utterly unpredictable, and as I said, the willingess of Germany to engage in military conflicts is very questionable. France and the UK would hardly want to fight Russia on their own if they US decided to stay out.

I'm not saying all of this is a highly likely scenario, but it certainly cannot be ruled out.

Notice a pattern yet?

Those names really are boring though, the old ""son of"" names (like Iceland still has) were frozen in the 1800s, and now people are stuck with generic ""son of *insert-common-19th-century-name-here*""... 

We have plenty of more interesting surnames too, they are just much rarer. Lots of nature names, like different trees (Lind, Bj√∂rk: Linden, Birch), or named by places (Berg, Str√∂m: Mountain, Stream), and some purely military names (Sv√§rd, Stark: Sword, Strong). Most of those names are actually old ""military names"", given to recruits back in the day. 

But I think as people get married they have a tendency to shift towards the more interesting names. Which I really don't think is a bad thing. *something-sson* is just so boring.

3125,"&gt; ""Nazism"" as of itself IS an ideology

These things are opinions, and the prevalent theory about this is that nazism is an ideology. I tend towards disagreeing, for whatever value you want to put in my opinion, because it's hard to pin down what exactly *is* nazism. Personally I'm more comfortable with the word ""Hitlerism"". This is because, like Stalinism or Maoism, the ""ideology"" is so directly tied to the persona of the leader that such a connection takes primacy over purely ""ideological"" concerns.

Now, if we're to say that Nazism is the policies that were advanced by nazi-Germany, then nazism as a political ideology becomes riddled with contradictions as these policies were all over the place. Nazi Germany is famous for overlapping areas of responsibility thus creating competition between lower level leaders for Hitler's favor. For this reason these actors would act in accordance with their own interpretation of Hitlers will. I don't understand how one could perceive this patchwork of policies as a unified ideology.

Conversely, attempting to define nazism as an ideology through analyzing Hitler's stated opinions inevitably leads you to ignore the widely differing ways these words led to policy. 

Thus Nazi Germany to my eye, and as I understand it in the eyes of the nazis themselves at the time, is more of a vaguely defined political movement than an actual ideology.

There are other facets to this of course. Fascisms longstanding tendency towards anti-intellectualism means debates and grandly formulated thesis tend to escape the movement and make it harder to pin down exactly what it stands for. This is something that I understand to be by design.

&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyaram_Sloyan

You've literally linked that for the nth time now, going through your profile history. Kyaram and Safarov case are one-together, and you are linking them separately, almost as if they are different incidences... Hmm...

&gt;But again, I'm sure beheadings and murdering people in their sleep are some how justified because Armenia did something just as bad 30 years ago.

He killed one guy, who happened to be an Armenian military soldier. If you didn't know, Armenia and Azerbaijan are still at war with one another and that the Armenian soldier is still to be regarded as an enemy combatant.

Maybe Safarov learned from his Armenian neighbors who during the Karabakh war, were cutting the heads of Azerbaijanis by the truckload and were blowing the back of childrens and womens skulls apart into shreds of meat?

http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/03/world/massacre-by-armenians-being-reported.html

- Women and children had been scalped,"" said Assad Faradzhev, an aide to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. ""When we began to pick up bodies, they began firing at us.""

- The Azerbaijani militia chief in Agdam, Rashid Mamedov, said: ""The bodies are lying there like flocks of sheep. Even the fascists did nothing like this.""

- Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the backs of their heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians had prevented them from retrieving more bodies.


- Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a Reuters photographer, Frederique Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani bodies.

- ""In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there were almost as many in the second,"" she said. ""Some had their heads cut off, and many had been burned. They were all men, and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms.""

&gt;Why not just admit your country is evil? It's obvious to everyone.

Hmm, yes... Very evil country, it must be in our blood. You must be an admirer of Hitler, who claimed that Jews were an evil people as well. We all know what Hitler ended up doing. 

&gt;Whether Armenia is also evil doesn't change that fact.

Whatever you say, Armenians can never be evil. They are the purest souls.

Yes, they do. Not sure what the correct english term is but they're called ""Sp√§taussiedler"" in German.



A lot of countries offer similar deals. It's mostly due to WWI and WWII that re-shaped countries borders and tore apart thousands of families.


South Tyrol for example was annexed by Italy after WWI. Italy didn't expel the citizens but forced them to become Italian. They forbid the german language, every road sign was switched to italian, in school german was forbidden, etc. Italy also moved thousands of italian workers to south tyrol, simply to outnumber the german speaking people over time. The whole process was called [Italianization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italianization).

It didn't work. Austria always supported South Tyrol, the citizens kept their language and culture. South Tyrol became an autonomous region. A lot of people have family on both sides or are just much closer to Austria due to language&amp;culture. Let them have their dual citizenship and move on.

3250,"&gt; Hungarian government demanded more rights from the Austrians and the emperor, but at the same time denied the same allowances to Slovaks.

That's extremely oversimplified.

Hungarian government actually demanded freeing the serfs of all ethnicities, taxing the nobility and erasing privileges (resisted by Slovak and Hungarian noblemen alike), and respecting the Hungarian constitution and autonomy (we saw it as a personal union, Habsburgs wanted us to be fully integrated into their empire). When Vienna refused this idea the radical Hungarians decided to secede entirely, take arms against the Habsburgs and Kossuth even sketched the idea of a Danube Federation in which all ethnicities had the same rights - but you're right, Slovaks were seen as Czech-speaking Hungarians, not as a separate ethnicity.

Several minorities, however, took arms and fought *for* the Habsburgs which made Hungarian leadership extremely paranoid. The revolution was lost due to Russian intervention and after 10 years of Bach dictatorship (during which Hungarians were punished and Germanized while minorities rewarded for fighting against us), passive resistance here, unrest in the Italian part of the Empire and Hungarian emigrants actively turning courts against the Habsburgs, they gave up and proposed the Compromise which gave Hungarians superior rights and reduced other minority rights, then minorities were tried to be assimilated - partly due to nationalism, partly so that they will not fight against us once again.

I do appreciate that you noted the Slovak perspective and admitted the mistreatment afterwards (which is quite rare, sadly). The thing is that all countries interpret history differently to fit their national myth, conscience and current geopolitical goals. We should admit Magyarization more in history education but I think that you should also get the whole story, not just that evil Hungarians tried to assimilate you.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/9gr5lx/what_do_you_know_about_the_austrohungarian_empire/e66uyq7/,AllinWaker,1537275094

&gt;Suppose the new money created since 2009, instead of propping up bond prices, had simply been added to the bank accounts of all U.S. and British households. In the U.S., $2 trillion of QE could have financed a cash windfall of $6,500 for every man, woman and child, or $26,000 for a family of four. Britain‚Äôs QE of ¬£375 billion is worth ¬£6,000 per head or ¬£24,000 per family. Even if only half the new money created were distributed in this way, these sums would be easily large enough to transform economic conditions, whether the people receiving these windfalls decided to spend them on extra consumption or save them and reduce debts.

Makes it easier to manipulate to populus, which is something in which political parties always delight.

(This is why any and every honest, principled citizen should resist the self-serving acts of a given political party. In my opinion, parties should formulate policies based on sincere, magnanimous, and unselfish principles of such kind as meant to serve all the (honest, law-abiding) citizens, improve the whole country and strengthen the democracy. 

All too many people are instead willing to pledge loyalty to political parties (who do not almost ever truly reciprocate, parties' first and foremost loyalty lying only to themselves, and their most important goal being to promote themselves by whatever means - and base, divisionary and manipulative political rhetoric is the cheapest and most effective way in almost all countries) who merely seek to advance the goals of some interest groups (the religious, the conservative, the liberal, the nationalistic etc.). We ought to strive to *overcome* primitive tribalism, *not* treat politics as a team sport where you delude yourself counting as a ""winner"" when you cheerlead a given political party.)

&amp;#x200B;

You enter the station. No seating outside the ticket booth/entry doors. None inside it. You get on the superlong escalator going down. Unsure how long the tallest are, but more than 30 meters in height (90+ steps, each around 30cm high; often they don't work, because the company who built them and the one who ordered them are corrupt fuckwits in cahoots with each other). Then you get down to the middle section (sometimes there's an extra platform just before it, but no seating there either). You have to walk another 50-75 meters, (past where the photo above is taken) then you can find the most uncomfortable seating you can imagine. Maybe 20-30 places, which should be enough for people waiting for their trains. about 65000 people take these trains a normal winters day. Anyway. Let's go down to the platform. You'll find more of these leaning benches and maybe a total of 20 'chairs', all occupied by people.  


At least we can sit on the train, unless you travel during rush hours when they're full. Then a little less than half can sit down (750 out of 1800). When you arrive in the suburb, there's actually some seating; some metal seats in the outdoors (fun to sit on in -15 degrees celsius) and maybe 12 places indoors. (some stations have a little more, others less). They're usually taken by people waiting for another train.  


Leaving the office, I just assume I won't be sitting down until I get home, whenever that maybe. Usually an hour, sometimes two, in rare cases three or four.

Maybe you getting off by various polls regarding fate of USSR and whatever it should've been disbanded, but numbers there due to nostalgia of a better life that many percept was in the past as they can't see it in front of them.

Like pretend that Estonia was historically Russian land, i doubt that anyone will buy this shit in Russia at all? Maybe you tried to use the word revanchism, but in fact Russia society lacked this ideas till Bush Sr. stated that US won in Cold War, while majority consider that Cold War ended with Gorbachev and Reagen and in Russia we considered that we just dismantled dysfunctional system, but such statement allowed previous and current governments to reignite idea that we lost to someone and now we won't do that again, which is retarded on many levels.

3333,"&gt;So did the language not change much since then (separately)? That's pretty interesting.

I don't know how similar it is to actual 19th century Croatian, but because they mostly spoke it at home and it saw limited use, it saw limited change. They use some antiquated words which are no longer common in Croatian, also most of it is extremely dialectal because at the time public education wasn't a widespread thing and there was no Standard Croatian.

&gt;We have Santa on the 6th of December (the day of St Nicholas) and Small Jesus (technically Christkind) on Christmas Eve, 24th of Dec. The first one is minor and puts gifts in your boot (usually sweets) and the second under the Christmas tree. No socks, cookies, milk and the like. Adults don't have Santa but generally gift each other for Christmas. From a certain time in your teens you start gifting your parents, too.

We also have the 6th and it's Saint Nicholas, not Santa Claus, bringing gifts, the 13th Saint Lucy also brings gifts (I think this is Italian in origin, we do it in Dalmatia not sure about other parts), we also plant wheat on Saint Lucy's day, and of course there's Christmas, gifts are received on the morning of 25th, and they're traditionally brought by baby Jesus (Jesus was replaced by Djed Mraz during communism, some families use Djed Mraz, some don't), Saint Nicholas and Saint Lucy are minor gifts, so candy and such.

3345,"The central issue that is still not understood is what form of brexit can pass the UK parliament. Everything else, including if the EU would agree to it is kinda irrelevant if May cannot deliver anything at all. Over the summer months we saw the collapse of May's Chequers Plan in all but name. Evidence for this is clear from the lack of speeches May herself pushed out during the summer (grand total of 1 mayor push around the country), Borris and Cos hardline push for no deal and the abandonment of the plan from moderate tory remainers, who have now moved to support referendum 2.0. (For more discussion on this see the guardians weekly politics podcast summer recap)   


I doubt at this point there is any policy that could pass parliament for any specific plan. Lets say the UK would get any deal it wants as long as it fits into an existing EU styled relationship (EU redline). My appreciation is Labour is mostly split between Leave with Single Market Labour, and Remain. Lib dems are relatively insignificant but remainers. Tories are split between remainers, single market remainers, Chequers deal remainers, and of course the huge support for no deal brexit. Ukip obviously are hardline on the EU issue.   


None of those groups, even with cross party support, have the ability to pass their plan with 50% of the house. Even if we assume that labour would support some policy of the governments for brexit and not have any decent (which is totally not in their best interest if they want to topple the government for a new election), I doubt there is a first preference deal. Is it likely then that some compromised chequers plan will gain cross party support? Or do you think that Boris and Co will capitulate back to Chequers when they staked their political careers on crushing it? If there isnt a deal, the default position of the backstop is way more easily undone by no-deal supporters. They have all the incentive in the world to oppose the government at the last min and leave May with the fallout.   


I cant help but feel that we are all distracted by whether you like Brexit or not, whether there is going to be a deal or not between the Eu and the UK. I cannot see the math working out for May. Even if there still is support to leave the EU in some capacity (which seems iffy but possible according to the polls) there certainly isnt a majority position in favour of any one plan. Governing is about passing legislation, and if an exit deal doesnt pass, the hardline anti brexiteers win way more than in a compromise deal that has a chance of passing. 

&amp;#x200B;

And even if may gets a magical unicorn deal together that fixes everything in her tory party or attracts enough exit labour MPs, what then? Is it likely that the EU would just eat the deal because its bad not to? I think we should all be very prepared for No Deal regardless of if you like it or not.

We have just seen our biggest ally engulf itself in flames, almost entirely because the political left - and its voters - had gotten so smug, full of itself and cruel/dismissive of the other half of their country, that they elected a total lunatic because *he fought back*. Their country's on fucking fire, and people are still cheering him on *because he's fighting back*. If every time you talk to someone you disagree with, and you treat them like an 'enemy' that's doing 'damage', rather than just a citizen that has different views and wishes his government would act on those rather than yours, they will naturally gravitate to the far-right kind of assholes like Trump or Putin that promise to put your smug ass back in your place.

3391,"That's the problem with tourist traps. People visit Italian cities looking for a certain experience, which is usually offered by average businesses both in food quality and employees' skills. I see it all the time: people visit Venice and want to eat a carbonara. That's not how it works. If you really want to enjoy Italy you should consider the Italian lifestyle (and I mean the real one, not the stereotypical one). If you go in a city with high tourist presence you should expect that the majority of places have a menu conceived to attract tourists (with the usual pizza, carbonara, tortellini, etc) of average/low quality food. Once a tourist is inside, he/she usually eats, get scammed. If things go well the tourist spends a lot for low quality stuff but is satisfied (or slightly disappointed). If things go bad, the tourist spends a lot, swears that he/she will never return in such place and get rapidly replaced by a new gullible tourist.

In addition, Italy has a huge food variety.

""The system has to change allthough not in a way PiS is doing it. One thing people don't know outside of Poland is that 3 division of power in our constitution is super Montesqiuan with hordly any supervision mechanism between them not really seen elswhere. What it results in is that judiciary is devoid of any supervision or control accept its own insider thing. If the judge or procecutor is lazy ineffective or an asshole, all he has to fear is ""colleague court "" . What the result is that in impossible number of cases processes they would take years to judge a simple stuff. Actually majority of rulings of European Court of Justice against Poland was due to lenght of court procedings. Why the constitution sets it like that? It was implemented in 1997 and written on the recomendations of people from former Solidarity movement who experianced great injustice from legal system in commie times and had this silly idea that the whole problems come from too much power in the goverment hands and so on. As we have seen it's not only the case. The idea is to put some supervision on courts where lazy or evil judge can be punished because the ""colleague ""thing doesn't work. Problem is that the government is going too far with this plus theycannot do it without breaking the constitution. This is simply why none previous governments tried to change it. We knew we have a problem for many years now""

To add to this, polish people are supporting government even though they see risk because they have two choices, either stay with system that we know sucks for many years or take a risk and possibly(but unlikely) improve the situation, even if nothing changes for better polish people believe they will send message to judges that polish people wont tolerate what they are doing and if they do BS like this again, they will vote for someone who WILL replace them.

Also polish people are also supporting government with the changes because they are afraid what it would mean if this change fails, it would mean that juidicary in Poland is unreformable, which is pretty scary knowing that there is a ""caste"" in Poland that has huge impact on what is happening in Poland and who cant be touched if they do something bad.

&amp;#x200B;

There were some tensions, because of the lower status Alsace-Lorraine had compared to other regions of Germanys. However this never led to an urprising or  a situation were German rule was under threat.

\&gt; The sentiment of belonging to France, 40 years after German annexation, despite their language being Germanic, was still very present. 

After Germany lost the war in 1918 people were at first glad that French soldiers came and crushed the socialist republic. However shortly after the autonomy movement (demanding for equal status of German and French, plus exceptions of many French laws like seperation of state and church) became by far the strongest political movement in Alsace due to language supression and underdevelopment of the region promoted by Paris. 

\&gt; After French and allied victory in WW1, Alsace was given back to France. Then lost again to Nazi Germany in WW2,  

Here is the true reason why Alsace is French. Everytime one of two powers won a war they took Alsace without asking the population what they want. If Germany would have won WWI or WWII Alsace would ve just German today and nobody would care about France anymore.

\&gt; Nowadays, at best Alsatians have and demand a certain degree of autonomy.  

&amp;#x200B;

There is no such thing. Today Alsace is a normal region of France with at best a German tinct in architecture and culture albeit with the local dialect dying. First there was a systematic supression of the language by Paris and second the Alsatians decided to give up their culture after Germany lost WWII (we dont want to belong to the losers is a better phrase than ""malgr√©s nous"".",,/r/europe/comments/9gjysg/name_of_d√∂ner_kebab_in_francophone_europe/e66mdzv/,Spioenkop,1537260396

3425,"&gt; In the worst case, S√∂der forms a coalition government with the AfD, which is slated to come in third; that would give the AfD their very first seats in the federal upper chamber and completely take out Bavaria's votes in it, since AfD cabinet members can block everything. 

The problem for S√∂der at that point is that, if he does that, the CDU/CSU fraction would be dead. There is no way that the majority of CDU voters would accept the CDU keeping a faction with the CSU if they now openly enter a coalition with the AfD. That would be worse than if the SPD would form a coalition with the Linke. At that point, the CDU would be forced to break ties with the CSU and start to negotiate a new government with red/green while they start up a Bayern CDU, which would go in contest with the CSU from now on forward. That would endanger the power structure of the CSU deeply, as many people are unsatisfied with the CSU and would rather like to vote for the CDU instead. While the CSU at that point could go federal as well, they don't have the budget to suddenly expand their campaigning from one to 16 states, while the CDU would have little problem to just expand to Bavaria.

This would also make the new government of the CSU more diffiuclt. If a Bavarian CDU exist, it is possible that the moderate parts of the CSU would leave and enter the Bavaria CDU. A member of parliament, in states as well, are elected for 4 years, no matter if they end their party affiliation or not. The question if a CSU/AfD coalition could survive is based on the question how many people in parliament would dicide to move from CSU to a Bavarian CDU.

To whom? Who actually is expects anyone to be a caregiver? And who chooses to prioritize their family because the society wants it rather than because they want it?

In politics we see men showing a lot more interest in general to political jobs. I think this is similar to men showing more interest in their careers in general. However women vote more and show more interest in societal issues. So I really cannot see how they have less political power. 

Marriage and consent? Don‚Äôt know what you mean assuming we live in a western society. Obviously there are still societies that are patriarchal in the literal meaning of the word.

There are in my opinion a couple of fundamental problems with all your arguments. First you have given some implicit value to choices and for some reason think that the choices men do are more valuable. That women are stupid to choose the less valuable things or they must be oppressed to do so. However when you go down to individual level you see that people do not value things like that. I would like you to tell a woman who just got her first child that it is the patriarchal society that makes her choose to prioritize that child over her career. Another underlying problem is that you look at averages instead of individuals. You fail to see that women who choose to prioritize differently are equally successful (and get paid equally well) than the men who make those choices. The average doesn‚Äôt affect them at all. The average doesn‚Äôt affect anyone. It just describes a distribution. 

Stereotypes? Sure. People have stereotypes about everything. We think trough stereotypes every day. If that is patriarchy then there is nothing to do. ",Finland,/r/europe/comments/9ghn7c/male_domestic_abuse_not_enough_support_for/e66mlga/,jaaval,1537260877

1. EU treats Poland like shit (not only Poland, but Poland is topic here), enacts one hell of laws that change nothing for highly developped countries but is a big problem for lesser ones, since Poland cannot keep up, it gets sanctioned and more money go for sanctions that would go for actually investing in keeping up with the rest.
2. Polish government licks German boots, does nothing, only smiles and gets kicked around.
3. Poles are disillusioned. Those, who would vote for pro-EU party don't even go to vote during elections. Last elections had barely enough votes to be valid.
4. Anti-EU, nationalistic, authoritarian party wins with a strong majority in government. (Imagine one party having like 80% of seats)
5. This party enacts a lot of authoritarian changes, controls media etc. recently they decided that since west calls our judges corrupted, it may help to make judges government-appointed officials. **Very Bad Idea**
6. Poland gets sanctioned again for straying away from what other countries consider democratic. Through media control it is portrayed as another ""suck it Poles"" move for no valid reason.

Additionally:

Pro-EU party voted for internet censorship in recent EU events, anti-EU nationalists voted against. This information alone may make a lot of young people vote for them (anti-ACTA protests started in Poland after all, we care more strongly about freedom in internet than freedom outside of it). 

Currently poles are on a long-time low about their trust towards both Polish Government and European Union, people rarely vote in elections believing that it no longer changes anything as they believe Polish Government to hold no power in Poland any more, and EU to not even care about Poland as long as it's not about kicking Poles around.

&gt; [Humans] have been genetically programmed through hunting behavior: cooperation and sharing. Cooperation between members of the same band was a practical necessity for most hunting societies; so was the sharing of food. Since meat is perishable in most climates except that of the Arctic, it could not be preserved. Luck in hunting was not equally divided among all hunters; hence the practical outcome was that those who had luck today would share their food with those who would be lucky tomorrow. Assuming hunting behavior led to genetic changes, the conclusion would be that modern man has an innate impulse for cooperation and sharing, rather than for killing and cruelty.

&gt;&gt; That is, in a rule of law society, the erosion of particular protections, most relevant here being the protections for minorities and civil liberties, would require either constitutional change or even a new constitution altogether.

&gt; Why do you assume bad actors will act in good faith?

I didn't. I clearly stipulated the condition that there is a rule of law society, a rule of law society being one where the rule of law prevails. By contrast, a non-rule of law society is a society in which the rule of law does not prevail.

&gt; Americans have never changed their Bill of Rights, and yet there has been erosion of particular protections for freedom of speech, of religion, the right to keep and to bear arms, and the right to be free from warrantless searches and seizures. How? By judges (mis)interpreting the law.

The US does not have an official interpretation of its constitution. There are certain aspects that could be covered by the principle that the American constitution is a living document, in which case it would not make sense to hold an originalist position that a law is being misinterpreted. But I will agree that the egregious practices and injustices of the US are violations of the existing norms of the rule of law.

3572,"Never heard of it either, so I did a little research. To put it quickly, you can think of it as the Union-level equivalent of England's [Judges' Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judges%27_Council)  or France's *Conseil Sup√©rieur de la Magistrature*.

The purpose of such councils is to ensure that the judiciary order is effectively independant from the executive  and the legislative orders, as per the checks and balances that found every self-respecting democracy.

&gt;Why would national judiciaries of different countries need to ""cooperate""?

As you may have noticed, in the last fifty years, Union laws has become increasingly important in the national law of every member state. See also [subsidiarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity#General_principle_of_European_Union_law). So, the way a given European law is handled in various countries sure is a topic for scrutiny.


At any rate, the need for national judiciaries to  cooperate is pretty obvious, isn't it ?

&gt;This is the job of the EU institutions 

Which one of those exactly ?

The only Union-wide judiciary institution is the [Court of Justice of the European Union](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/), which, as you know, deals only with member *states* but has very little outreach as to everyday justice.

&gt;and the Polish legislature and executive,

Very precisely absolutely definitely ***not*** the legislature ***nor*** the executive. The basis of democracy is the separation of powers, meaning a judiciary distinct and independant from the executive and the legislature. (That is, until our scientists bioengineer a breed of *politicians so honest that they never abuse their power nor ever break the laws they make* ;-)

See also *rule of law*.

That last point indeed is the very core of all the feuds between the V4 and the rest of the Union.

&gt; In a 2 party election, majority rule is the only voting system that is anonymous, neutral, and monotone.

In short, according to May's Theorem, majority rule is the best voting system for 2-party voting. But it does not account for voting schemes with more than 2 alternatives, or let's say social pluralities with more than 2 groups, so its applicability and use is very restricted. Rather than demonstrating that democracy requires majority rule, it would be more accurate to say that majority rule is only shown to be justified in a competition between exactly 2 parties.

So, what is a relevant theorem then according to social choice theory? Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. Its definition:

&gt; In an election with more than 2 candidates, there is no fair method of voting that will simultaneously satisfy the majority criterion, the monoticity criterion, the condorcet criterion, and the independence of irrelevant alternatives criterion.

Well, fudge.

Democracy has not always meant majority rule. Certain liberal democracies have constitutional and legal limits over the scope of powers available to majority rule. Liberal democracies after all seek to mediate between pluralities. Such limits are specifically put in place to give legal protection for minorities from the 'tyranny of the majority' and antipluralist movements. That is, in a rule of law society, the erosion of particular protections, most relevant here being the protections for minorities and civil liberties, would require either constitutional change or even a new constitution altogether. Majoritarianism has been used often in the past to reinforce castes and persecute marginals. Therefore, certain provisions in particular constitutions may be made unamendable. A good example to consider is Art. 79 para. 3 of [Germany's Basic Law](https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf) that enscribes fundamental principles which even parliament cannot amend.

&gt; Amendments to this Basic Law affecting the division of

I must agree. The castles are eerily similar and it makes me nearly certain it's the correct castle. There are obviously no mountains but as mentioned there are no mountains like the ones portrayed in Prussia anyway.

Bedzin was part of the Kingdom of Prussia for a short period of time in the 1800s so that's another plus.  

Another big factor is the fact many other preserved castles in the Prussian area of Poland were Teutonic castles and they look differently (square towers with rooftops etc etc) so that there are not going to be too many  other castles to choose from.

3931,"&gt;What about him?

&gt;Du≈°an conquered a large part of southeast Europe, becoming one of the most powerful monarchs of the era. Under Dusan's rule Serbia was the major power in the Balkans, and the multi-lingual empire stretched from the Danube to the Gulf of Corynth, with its capital in Skopje.[1] He enacted the constitution of the Serbian Empire, known as Du≈°an's Code, perhaps the most important literary work of medieval Serbia.

By conquest they don't mean pillow fights and sleep overs.

&gt;Or testament of privilege

Serbia was the only Autonomous region in the empire. The only Officially recognized church within the Empire and its influence only expanded when Serbia was absorbed into the Ottomans. Serbian was taught,learned and studied, on the other hand Albanian was illegal till late 1800s.  Serbian cities in particular Belgrade became important trade hubs where they prospered and expanded their influences on the surrounding regions. 

&gt;ince either you believe Albanians were genetically superior to other people, or they had privilege in the Empire.

Lmao what the fuck? Read on The people of the Ottoman Empire. Serbians controlled the West Balkans Trade routes and were the most prominent Mercheants in this part of the region. They were so good at it they created enclaves in Italy where they are still known for this. Privilege?  Greeks were known for their larger than life plantations and diplomatic skills, hence why the richest people in the Empire were Greek. Privilege? Albanians were noted for being skilled warriors and determined on rising the ranks of the army. There were even ""affermative actions"" taken to bar them from doing so because they were getting power too  often. Privilege? According to you yes.

&gt;And seeing how only you ended up majority Muslim, id say it's the latter, not the former.

Albanians converted in the 1800s to avoid taxation. Unlike you we didn't kill our muslims. There is an entire nation next to you filled with Serbian Muslims who fled from you.

&gt;You think those migrations were peaceful?

You think your migrations to the balkans were?

&gt;You've been systematically oppressing/slaughtering Serbs in Kosovo for 350 years, with or without Ottoman/Hungarian help. That's what it has to do with the massacres 106 years ago.

As the russians say : Proofz.

I love this link. I have a really soft spot for it, because everytime you bring it up I debunk it, and yet your memory resets and you bring it up in another forum. Sources :

&gt;Apparently he worked with the Ottomans, how is it that your every 'anti- Ottoman' was first an Ottoman bitch?

Serbs worked with Ottomans under Brankovic during his whole life. According to your logic you are ""ottoman bitches"" ?

&gt;because you didn't have a state lmao

I am also a fan of this part. Albania is an artificial state created by Hungaria to stop serbs. Bosnia is a fake state too created by the West also to stop Serbia. Croatia too though you are more lenient there. Montenegrins are ""brainwashed serbs"" artificial state created by the West to stop Serbs. Macedonians too. Man there are so many fake artificial states in the Balkans all created to spite Serbia. What a shame. Deretic was right, Europeans are just jealous and spiteful of you.

The Nazis started out as a very broad party as a response to Bolshevism, but then removed left / socialist ideologues form the party when they centralised power around Hitler. Furthermore, Hitler despited socialism and communism. 

What we do have though, are facts that show that the NSDAP was a far right party. They despised Communism and Socialists (banning both parties in Germany and murdering thousands), they dissolved labour unions in favour of a centralised one under the NSDAP, work conditions got worse, cartels formed, race laws came into law and they waged war based on race ideologies. These are clear signs, that the NSDAP was a far-right party.

But it was voluntary and pretty commonplace around the world with the advent of new technologies and shared culture.

But there's this very new globalist phenomenon today, mass immigration, which you can't possibly compare to natural evolution of a native culture in the middle ages and Rennaissance, and modern times...

Because the majority weren't even processed, some were covered up by KFOR as well.

People flee from war, most of those returned when the war was over, how many Serbs returned?

&gt;and 9,000 died. 

Only 2000- something confirmed, and most of which happened when NATO intervened, not when Yugoslavia was fighting the Albanian terrorists.

How many massacres did Serbs commit after the war, i remember Albanians doing 3+? That's the most important question, war crimes are one thing, but peace time crimes are a whole different kind of animalistic behaviour. 

Furthermore, how many Albanians were sent to the ICTY?

1. Poland as independent kingdom existed to 1795.
2. Poland didn't have hereditary monarchy since 1569.
3. Constitution of 3 May 1791 restored it.
4. Last King of Poland had no legal children.
5. In case of king being childless, the crown would go to hands of  someone from House of Wettin.

Of course the Swedish officers don't know anything about that. For them, a graveyard might not be the nicest place to be at in the night time but whatevs, right?

So the Chinese ambassador is saying that since swedish police did something that's really insensitive and bad to chinese people (being transported close to a graveyard), then Sweden shouldn't complain that the chinese did something really insensitive and bad to a swedish person (Gui Minhai being locked up for life for selling books).

Some noble families of Bulgarian,Albanian,Greek,Vlach and Serbian descent were claiming her but the sources were not too convincing. We know her name was Vojsava so that means she was Orthodox. Other than that not much is known about her. We can't conclude her ethnicity due to religion either since Albanians in this era were part of the Serbian Orthodox Church and many names were adopted. Even on the wiki it says that there are too many conflicting ideas about her but people stick to what suits them. 

   Like that one video by that Arkan Dicksucker who used Gjon Muzaka as a source to try to prove Skanderbeg was pure Serb but when he was linked that Muzaka said Skanderbeg shares his blood due to Vojsava being part of their family he dropped the argument real quick and made a top 10 crazy montenegrin facts.

So, you've just changed the meaning of the words ""link tax"" to mean something entirely different.

Link tax =/= fraudulently claiming stuff

(Incidentally, the legislation also mentions systems to investigate and punish abuse like this)

&gt;There is no requirement to punish users, but the legislation is set up to be punitive because of the numerous technological loopholes it gives access to.

You're moving the goalposts here. Your original claim here was :

&gt;The directive requires the ISPs [...] sanction those that have infringed upon the copyright.

That is something completely different than ""bad implementation can hurt people.

&gt;There is no requirement to determine and pinpoint each and every case without failure, but the only alternative is to avoid hosting any sort of content, in order to avoid being subject to the legislation.

This is just plain false. The actual legislation states :

&gt;In the absence of the authorisation referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, Member States shall provide that an online content sharing service provider **shall not be liable
for acts of communication to the public or making available to the public within the meaning** of this Article when:
(a) it demonstrates that it has made best efforts to prevent the availability of specific works or other subject matter by implementing effective and proportionate measures, in
accordance with paragraph 5  ... (text continues and stipulates a few more things) 

So, if the service provider takes appropriate measures (what is appropriated is determined by the memberstate), then they are not liable.

&gt;Why wouldn't Ukraine, Lithuania, all of their subjects, including Crimea continue to belong to Russia?

Lithuania was never ""legally"" annexed. It was illegal occupation as our president never signed any papers. Don't know about Ukraine.

&gt; 1) If the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine was never legal in the first place (as I outlined) and Russia is the successor of the USSR, why wouldn't Crimea continue to belong to Russia?

Majority of Crimeans voted for independent Ukraine (with higher Russian percentage in 1991 than in 2014).

&gt; 2) Forget that, even if the transfer in 1954 of Crimea to Ukraine was legal, which you believe it is. Why doesn't the Soviet Court ruling overrule that? Do you think it's fair to pick and chose which rulings or decrees to base an opinion on?

What Soviet Court ruling are you even speaking about? Are you talking about the Russian (NOT Soviet) one? 

&gt;The earlier published documents and materials that have emerged more recently confirm that the transfer of Crimea from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR was carried out in accordance with the 1936 Soviet constitution, which in Article 18 stipulated that ""the territory of a Union Republic may not be altered without its consent."" The proceedings of the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium meeting indicate that both the Russian SFSR and the Ukrainian SSR had given their consent via their republic parliaments

U.S. gave from one to the other and then NJ seceded. Yes.

It's actually described who gets what. i.e. If you're a regional President, you'll get trialed by the Superior Court of Justice of your region, other than the provincial one. If you're the PM, you'll always be trialed by the Supreme Tribunal. If you're a judge, X; if you're military or police, you'll go to the Provicinal Courts and avoid the local one. Etc.

I've been doing some reading now, and one of the reasons this is argued for, is to favor a ""minor"" judge to not be pressured by the politician powers and influences, so you avoid what you could get as a regular citizen and go directly to a superior case.

I would argue it has the opposite effect, as you're assuming that influence to be there from the start.

And one immediate effect it always has, is that there's then 1 appeal less, for the good or the worse.

4364,"When someone points out something along the lines of ""not true feminism"" I always think of this quote by Karen Straughan:

¬†

""extremists? explain the following extremists heading the movement then. are they just radicals too?

So what you're saying is that you, a commenter using a username on an internet forum are the true feminist, and the feminists actually responsible for changing the laws, writing the academic theory, teaching the courses, influencing the public policies, and the massive, well-funded feminist organizations with thousands and thousands of members all of whom call themselves feminists... they are not ""real feminists"".

That's not just ""no true Scotsman"". That's delusional self deception.

Listen, if you want to call yourself a feminist, I don't care. I've been investigating feminism for more than 9 years now, and people like you used to piss me off, because to my mind all you were doing was providing cover and ballast for the powerful political and academic feminists you claim are just jerks. And believe me, they ARE jerks. If you knew half of what I know about the things they've done under the banner of feminism, maybe you'd stop calling yourself one.

But I want you to know. You don't matter. You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: ""Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,"" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, ""we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.""

You're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.

You're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were ""ambivalent about their sexual desires"" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.

You're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.

You're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.

You're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.

You're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.

You're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.

You're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's ""part of her sexual history.""

You're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is ""not a crime"" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a ""legal"" way to rape them.

And you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.

You're the true feminist. Some random person on the internet.""",Catalan-Spanish-Polish,/r/europe/comments/9ghn7c/male_domestic_abuse_not_enough_support_for/e64v0ub/,Daktush,1537196196

Very relevant to understand the context of what led to this as it was a direct result of the British and French betrayal of Czechoslovakia in their Munich agreement with Hitler. USSR and Germany were enemies and were buying time from a inevitable war at the time and USSR had no faith in help from its allies. Poland and this step was just pawn moving before war between the two.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement?wprov=sfla1

This was just prior to it:

&gt;On 22 May,¬†Juliusz ≈Åukasiewicz, the Polish ambassador to France, told the French Foreign Minister¬†Georges Bonnet¬†that if France moved against Germany in defense of Czechoslovakia: ""We shall not move."" ≈Åukasiewicz also told Bonnet that Poland would oppose any attempt by Soviet forces to defend Czechoslovakia from Germany.¬†Daladier¬†told¬†Jakob Surits, the Soviet ambassador to France: ""Not only can we not count on Polish support but we have no faith that Poland will not strike us in the back.""[17]

.

&gt;Joseph Stalin¬†was upset by the results of the Munich conference. The Soviets, who had a mutual military assistance treaty with Czechoslovakia, felt betrayed by France, who also had a mutual military assistance treaty with Czechoslovakia. The British and French, however, mostly used the Soviets as a threat to dangle over the Germans. Stalin concluded that the West had actively colluded with Hitler to hand over a¬†Central European¬†country to the Nazis, causing concern that they might do the same to the Soviet Union in the future, allowing the partition of the USSR between the western powers and the fascist¬†Axis. This belief led the Soviet Union to reorient its foreign policy towards a¬†rapprochement¬†with Germany, which eventually led to the signing of the¬†Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact¬†in 1939.[46]

It's pretty simple the outcome.

Also relevant.

&gt;Before the Munich Agreement Hitler's determination to invade Czechoslovakia on 1 October 1938 had provoked a major crisis in the German command structure. The Chief of the General Staff, General¬†Ludwig Beck, protested in a lengthy series of memos that it would start a world war that Germany would lose, and urged Hitler to put off the projected war. Hitler called Beck's arguments against war ""kindische Kr√§fteberechnungen"" (""childish force calculations""). On 4 August 1938, a secret Army meeting was held. Beck read his lengthy report to the assembled officers. They all agreed something had to be done to prevent certain disaster. Beck hoped they would all resign together but no one resigned except Beck. His replacement, General¬†Franz Halder, sympathised with Beck and they both conspired with several top generals, Admiral¬†Wilhelm Canaris¬†(Chief of German Intelligence), and¬†Graf von Helldorf¬†(Berlin's Police Chief) to arrest Hitler the moment he gave the invasion order. This plan would only work if Britain issued a strong warning and a letter to the effect that they would fight to preserve Czechoslovakia. This would help to convince the German people that certain defeat awaited Germany. Agents were therefore sent to England to tell Chamberlain that an attack on Czechoslovakia was planned, and of their intention to overthrow Hitler if this occurred. The proposal was rejected by the British Cabinet and no such letter was issued. Accordingly, the proposed removal of Hitler did not go ahead.¬†On this basis it has been argued that the Munich Agreement kept Hitler in power, although whether it would have been any more successful than the 1944 plot is doubtful.

And lastly in Hitlers own words about the agreement. At 6:35 he talks about it but the entire recording is informative and very rare. Almost all recordings of Hotler speaking especially about the war and strategies and politics was destroyed.

No, you also said ""if you post a picture/video online, if there is any copyrighted logo/image in view, even if it is not the main focus of the picture, it will likely be recognised by these algorithms as an infringement"". Which is not at all what Facebook and YouTube do.

&gt;You are missing the other parts. If the platform has the rights, the uploader has the rights.

&gt;&gt;Licensing agreements which are concluded by online content sharing service providers with right holders for the acts of communication referred to in paragraph 1, shall cover the liability for works uploaded by the users

I don't know what 'rights' you're talking about (the platform can't have copyright rights for uploads), but in any case: if the upload service never made a licensing agreement with a right holder, then there's no licensing agreement to cover any liability.

&gt;Furthermore, the very first paragraph of Article 13 states that the directive includes the content uploaded by users to the platform

Yes, because a different part of Article 13 addresses that. But does not hold the upload service liable for copyright infringement.

&gt;A major problem with these directive is precisely the fact that they leave a lot of room for interpertation.

Yes, that's always the case with directives. They're deliberately vague so that it's up to the individual countries to decide how to implement them.

4524,"&gt;I think you're confusing patriarchy with male gender and men being causative agents. 

Plenty of feminists certainly do. That's the whole problem.

&gt;You're also missing the point that patriarchy also hurts men.

Ah, the traditional clincher. ""Patriarchy also hurts men. Therefore, you must shut up and agree with anything we say."" Feminists have a cottage industry of redefining words to fit their ideology. But their actions speak louder than words. Why do feminists oppose shelter for male victims of domestic abuse? It's easily explained by the realization that feminism is an interest group for women, but it can't be explained with the idea: ""fighting the patriarchy is good for men too"".

&gt;That's the very reason why men expected to pay the meals, look after the women like if they're their children, they're expected to earn more, be in higher this and that, and such.

Then why do feminists never address these problems? No feminist every bothered to campaign to encourage women to split the bill. 

In the #metoo movement they *still* shove all the responsibility on the men when intimate relations went further than everyone involved wanted, and they don't put forward that healthy communication and initiative in that regard is a two way street between genders.  The revelations about Asia Argento are an easy illustration of the hypocrisy. 

They never encouraged women to be satisfied with men with lower status: this can be readily observed too in women who declare themselves feminists.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/9ghn7c/male_domestic_abuse_not_enough_support_for/e64itzn/,silverionmox,1537181375

4549,"Main highlights

The benefits of the adoption of the euro in Croatia exceed the costs. While 
benefits are permanent and relatively considerable, costs are predominantly 
low and one-off. The adoption of the euro will reduce the risks to financial and 
macroeconomic stability and positively affect financing conditions, thus accelerating 
growth and strengthening the economy‚Äôs resilience. All new EU Member States of 
comparable size have therefore already introduced the euro.
The adoption of the euro eliminates currency risk for citizens, corporations and 
the government. It eliminates the possibility of a currency crisis and diminishes 
the risk of potentially expensive banking and balance-of-payments crises. The new 
financial architecture of the euro area strengthens protective mechanisms in case of 
economic disturbances.
Interest rates and transaction costs will decrease. The elimination of the currency 
risk will favourably affect the country‚Äôs risk premium, while regulatory costs for banks 
will substantially reduce, having a positive effect on interest rate levels. In addition, 
citizens and corporations will save on currency conversion transactions and charges 
for cross-border payments in euro. The lowering of transaction costs and greater price 
comparability will spur international trade and tourism.
Investments are expected to be positively affected. Lower interest rates will boost 
the competitiveness of domestic corporations and provide additional impetus to 
investments and employment, while the elimination of currency risk will positively 
affect the confidence of international investors in Croatia and thus contribute to 
attracting foreign direct investments.
The loss of independent monetary and exchange rate policy will not represent 
a substantial cost for Croatia. High credit and deposit euroisation and dominance 
of foreign-owned banks in the domestic banking system have narrowed the room 
for active use of monetary and exchange rate policy in Croatia. The monetary policy 
of the European Central Bank will be well suited for the needs of Croatia‚Äôs economy 
because Croatia is, both economically and financially, firmly integrated in the euro 
area. Consequently, its business cycle largely mimics developments in the euro area. 
Should the business cycle in Croatia start to diverge, the Croatian National Bank 
will react through its macroprudential policy, while the Government will employ an 
appropriate fiscal policy.
The adoption of the euro will only negligibly affect prices. Oversight over the 
process of price recalculation will limit the room for their unjustified increase.
Experiences of euro area Member States show that the effect of the adoption of the 
euro on prices was one-off and very mild in intensity.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/9gj9o0/strategy_for_the_adoption_of_the_euro_in_croatia/e64iwpz/,011110101,1537181520

But for the vast majority of common people it did not make a big economic difference, but why would it need to? Most common people already owned their own land before the war. We weren‚Äôt peasants revolting for more bread, the war was purely a political war. There is near infinite good land in America (compared to Europe). Common people back then owned lots of land becaus land was cheap. 


The country was not controlled by some WASP elite. The US is a populist country and there is lots of democracy at all levels of government. We even elect judges. 200 years ago they were also electing judges. Is that a good idea? Probably not, but it‚Äôs not control by the elite. 


I think your trying to overlay European politics onto American politics. The US was already relatively wealthy in the 1770s. The war wasn‚Äôt being fought by anyone because they were poor and wanted a better life. People just thought the UK was trampling on their rights as Colonists by exerting jurisdiction over them.

4623,"&gt;I think the problem is the whole of the directive put together. If it goes through as it is in the final vote, hosting companies will likely have to incorporate algorithms to check for copyright violations.

Not really the mandate does not require 'upload filters' or even directing that it is a must have. It suggest 'upload filters' as an example to how copyright violations can be combated. It also does not put complete liability on hosting companies for violation of copyright. The person violating the copyright is who is liable for the infringement. Hosting companies need to do their best to show that they are trying to prevent copyright infringement. This can be anything from youtube style upload filters to a protocol for reporting and removing client reported copyright violation material. But GDPR so very well pointed out companies hate doing this as it requires them to pay for upgrades which are usually marginal in costs and time of implementation. 

&gt;So, if you post a picture/video online, if there is any copyrighted logo/image in view, even if it is not the main focus of the picture, it will likely be recognised by these algorithms as an infringement.

While this could happen it's unlikely as I doubt most companies will be implementing their anti-copyright-violation in form of a upload filter.

The problem with anarchy is that it wouldn't work in a real life scenario. Say you depose the gov't and make money worthless so everyone can live as they please and do whatever they want. Humans need things like food, water, shelter, etc to survive so the folks who take over the farms and water sources quickly enough will emerge as a new capitalist bourgeoisie class.

&gt;What about communism spits on individualism? Living in a classless society, free of markets and wage labour, seems like the perfect society for self determination.

The Party becomes the new ruling class. We've seen it happen before, the Party folk get all the extra privileges like warm water and western imports while everyone else slaves away at their job. In theory communism *could* work if it was something like syndicalism instead but then at the end of the day it would still have a capitalist economic structure.

4775,"&gt;  Living in a classless society, free of markets and wage labour, seems like the perfect society for self determination 

You're right, but to achieve such a society would require people to abandon their individualism for the collective - i.e. the revolution of the proletariat. Our class is a part of our identity. And, in my opinion, so long as the minimums of life are provided - food, water, clothing and housing - people should be free to live their life and be in the class they want to be - class mobility exists, y'know - it might not be as quick as I'd wish it for be (average 2-3 generations). My class does create parts of my identity, and I don't see anything wrong with it. It's like my school and my workplace creates parts of my identity. Human beings are social creatures, and we like to fit into certain boxes. Class is one of these boxes.

&gt; In capitalism majority live to create profit for the ruling class, how is that individualism?  

Because the system does allow exploration of your ''self'' both within labour, and with the financial assets you acquire? It's not perfect, but it sure as hell is more realistic than a post-scarcity society without classes and without markets.

&gt; LONDON: Thousands of Indian medical professionals can now apply for jobs in the UK after home secretary Sajid Javid removed international doctors and nurses from the Tier 2 visa cap.

-

&gt; In a move that has been long called for, the home office said non-EU doctors and nurses will be excluded from the cap currently set at 20,700 per year on tier 2 visas, meaning an unrestricted number of Indian doctors and nurses could now work in the UK to help fill the vast number of NHS vacancies.

-

&gt; ‚ÄúRight now we need 10,000 doctors in the UK and even more nurses. We don‚Äôt want a brain drain from India, but many Indian doctors are keen to have training in the UK. It will benefit them, they can stay a few years and then go back. BAPIO will now assist Health Education England in bringing Indian doctors to England. However, we are keen to ensure they are not just used as an extra pair of hands but that they get appropriate mentoring and training.‚Äù ",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9gdp2v/nhs_mental_health_crisis_worsens_as_2000_staff/e645hel/,vokegaf,1537156446

https://www.iana.org/time-zones

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database

&gt; The tz database is a collaborative compilation of information about the world's time zones, primarily intended for use with computer programs and operating systems.[2] Paul Eggert is its current editor and maintainer,[3] with the organizational backing of ICANN.[4] The tz database is also known as tzdata, the zoneinfo database or IANA time zone database, and occasionally as the Olson database, referring to the founding contributor, Arthur David Olson.[5]
&gt;
&gt; Its uniform naming convention for time zones, such as America/New_York and Europe/Paris, was designed by Paul Eggert.[6] The database attempts to record historical time zones and all civil changes since 1970, the Unix time epoch.[7] It also includes transitions such as daylight saving time, and also records leap seconds.[8]
&gt;
&gt; The database, as well as some reference source code, is in the public domain.[9] New editions of the database and code are published as changes warrant, usually several times per year.[10]

When I first learned how often (and how crazily) timekeeping changes around the world, it boggled my mind.  I had some vague idea of a fixed, unchanging clock with some nice, even, hour bands around the world.  In practice, timezones show up and disappear, change the geographic area they cover, change along with political affilliations and ideology, and so forth.

The TZ file for Europe is the largest of all continents.

Take a snippet of Portugal, for instance:

    # Portugal

    # From Paul Eggert (2014-08-11), after a heads-up from Stephen Colebourne:
    # According to a Portuguese decree (1911-05-26)
    # https://dre.pt/application/dir/pdf1sdip/1911/05/12500/23132313.pdf
    # Lisbon was at -0:36:44.68, but switched to GMT on 1912-01-01 at 00:00.
    # Round the old offset to -0:36:45.  This agrees with Willett....
    #
    # From Michael Deckers (2018-02-15):
    # article 5 [of the 1911 decree; Deckers's translation] ...:
    # These dispositions shall enter into force at the instant at which,
    # according to the 2nd article, the civil day January 1, 1912 begins,
    # all clocks therefore having to be advanced or set back correspondingly ...

    # From Rui Pedro Salgueiro (1992-11-12):
    # Portugal has recently (September, 27) changed timezone
    # (from WET to MET or CET) to harmonize with EEC.
    #
    # Martin Bruckmann (1996-02-29) reports via Peter Ilieve
    # that Portugal is reverting to 0:00 by not moving its clocks this spring.
    # The new Prime Minister was fed up with getting up in the dark in the winter.
    #
    # From Paul Eggert (1996-11-12):
    # IATA SSIM (1991-09) reports several 1991-09 and 1992-09 transitions
    # at 02:00u, not 01:00u.  Assume that these are typos.
    # IATA SSIM (1991/1992) reports that the Azores were at -1:00.
    # IATA SSIM (1993-02) says +0:00; later issues (through 1996-09) say -1:00.
    # Guess that the Azores changed to EU rules in 1992 (since that's when Portugal
    # harmonized with EU rules), and that they stayed +0:00 that winter.
    #
    # Rule  NAME    FROM    TO      TYPE    IN      ON      AT      SAVE    LETTER/S
    # DSH writes that despite Decree 1,469 (1915), the change to the clocks was not
    # done every year, depending on what Spain did, because of railroad schedules.

Sudeten Germans living in Sudetenland believed that the Western powers and the USSR will keep 1938 boundaries, so they were less prone to run. My mom who remembers the end of the WWII in Protectorate, said that Germans fled so quickly that they left everything behind hearing the approaching Red Army. One of the kids in her street returned from a school home to find out that his family fled without him. 

In 1950 there were still hundreds of thousands Germans living in Czechoslovakia. Many Germans left in the 70s when the West Germany was giving them German passports. When I went to HS, we had several German speaking kids who got a German passport during the communist era and left permanently after Soviet Invasion. In Czechoslovakia many people had a mixed parentage (about 10% of the population) and could 'choose' where to go after the war. Judita Cerovska who was a famous Czech-German singer in the 60s came from such marriage. My uncle married a German woman in the 30s and both lived and died in Czechoslovakia in the 80s.

5033,"&gt;True, for now, but as the last downturn period has shown, the US is very weak when growth isn't here, and doesn't resist well to shocks, whereas France had a a minimal loss of growth, both systems have pros and cons.


The US was clobbered by the crisis in 2008, and had a recession for 18 months over 2007-2009, then the US went back to normal growth. France didn‚Äôt shrink much economically from 2007-2009, but then it didn‚Äôt grow much either. Then it also had basically stagnant growth from 2009-2017 while the US was chugging along back to normal. The US economy has grown much larger since 2006 than france‚Äôs has because the back to normal growth from 2009-present more than made up for what was lost from 2007-2009.


I would say that shows a US that bounced back really well from a big shock. The banks were immediately recapitalized, budget stimulus was done, quantitative easing was started immediately in 2008, and then the unemployment rate went back down, growth went back up, and the stock market was back to all time highs. The government was decisive and the recovery was decisive. France and much of the euro zone on the hand, has been stuck in more of an economic purgatory for since 2009. The US got back to it‚Äôs pre-crisis peak in 2011, the euro zone didn‚Äôt get back to its pre-crisis GDP until 2016.

&gt; Frustrated over Macron‚Äôs wide-ranging labor and welfare reforms, nurses, teachers and other public sector workers walked off the job on Thursday over concerns about his plans to cut their headcount and introduce merit-based pay.
&gt;
&gt; Protesters also want to derail Macron‚Äôs plans to raise a special tax used to finance welfare which hits pensioners particularly hard, overhaul unemployment insurance and shake up the highly indebted state railway company. 

If he's implementing unpopular decisions that will tend to strengthen France's economic structure, more power to him.

https://www.thelocal.fr/20141125/french-welfare-spending-not-sustainable

&gt; As France topped the latest global rankings for welfare spending, the analyst behind the report tells The Local, France's much admired welfare system is simply unsustainable.
&gt;
&gt; Nearly a third of France‚Äôs GDP goes on its welfare system, making it the country with the highest social expenditure in the world, new figures revealed this week.
&gt;
&gt; France spends some 32 percent of its GDP on its welfare state, well ahead of the global average of 22 percent, according to a new report from the Paris-based economic think-tank the OECD.
&gt;
&gt; Finland, Belgium, and Denmark are the only other countries whose spending tops 30 percent of the GDP. In the UK it stood at 22 percent and in the US 19 percent.
&gt;
&gt;One of the authors of the report Maxime Ladaique told The Local that French levels of spending on pensions, health care and the like are no longer sustainable.
&gt;
&gt; ‚ÄúWe have to keep in mind the population is getting older,‚Äù said Ladaique. ‚ÄúWhen France introduced its social security system there were seven workers for every one retired person, now there are only four workers and there are estimates that say in 30 to 40 years there will only be two people working for every one retiree.
&gt;
&gt; ‚ÄúThe system is already in deficit. If nothing is done about it, then the welfare system won't be sustainable. There needs to be reforms,‚Äù he said.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9gdtif/emmanuel_macrons_approval_rating_dips_below_20/e63x3dc/,vokegaf,1537147541

major takeaway:

*""Even when some localities received the appointed Gediminid leaders, the Lithuanian higher nobility in the Ruthenian lands largely embraced the Slavic customs and Orthodox Christianity and became indistinguishable from a larger Ruthenian nobility resulting in the two cultures merging to the extent that much of the upper class of Ruthenians merged into Lithuanian nobility and began to call themselves Lithuanians gente Rutenus natione Lituanus.[2] (Litviny),[3] yet spoke the Ruthenian language[4][5][6] In the effect of the processes, Lithuanian higher nobility became largely Ruthenian,[7] while the nobility in the ethnic Lithuania and Samogitia continued to use their native Lithuanian language.

Some Belorussians remember that they formed a lot of Lithuanian part of PLC. Lithuanians as many other conquerors with limited demographics compared to the conquered people adopted their culture and language. Around 1600 -1700 they considered themselves Lithuanians, spoke Ruthenian and wrote in Polish. Later Ruthenian were replaced by Polish in some places.

Because countries such as the US may have very low unemployment rate, however their participation rate is not good, and consequently there is actually a huge difference in the structure of their working force, as the unemployment rate is just partially showing the truth by not adding inactive people.

Although considering you linked the bullshit site of Pescanik which keeps peddling fake/wrong stats (can't really tell if they don't know how to do a statistical analysis or are intentionally modifying it), I'm not surprised.

Here's a UNODC murder rates. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate

Here's EUROSTAT murder rates

None of which support the false information in Pescanik bullshit. And not the fourth place (even if you take 2009 which was the year according to eurostat where the murder rate was the highest) it wasn't fourth. Albania had more, which would make it 5th. Oh wait Montenegro had more, which would make it 6th. Oh wait Cyrus had more which would make it 7th. According to EUROSTAT in 2009 Serbia was 9th in murder rates from all EUROSTAT countries. Would be 10th if Latvia contributed their information but they haven't, still considering they still have the murder rate of 3.5 

Pescanik should never be taken as a source, they're amazingly bad. Worse than tabloids I'd say. None of the sources they claim to use ever confirm their ""statistical analysis""

Edit: UNODC data for all euro countries from 2003-2016

Not a single data source matches the wild fancy of being 4th from Pescanik. They are not reliable at all. Also guilty of cherry picking, because why pick 2009 ? Why not 2015 (which is much more recent) where we had less murder rate than France or 2011 less murders than Norway ?

Soviet and Nazi Germany are useful short hands to describe each side, but that does not mean that all combatants were necesarily adherents of the ideology of their country. A minority of Germans voted for Hitler and once he took over, the state dominated society with very powerful propaganda. You seem to underestimate the overwhelming effects of propaganda and conformism on a population . If you were born in Germany in the 20s there is a high chance you would have collaborated instead of resisted, statistically speaking. I recommend reading Propaganda by Jacques Ellul.

Yes, and Italy does that with African countries too. Remember Gaddafi and his links with Silvio Belursconi? And don't tell me Salvini is squeaky clean either.

&gt;I don't think unrepentant thieves can give meaningful moral lessons.

Its not a moral lesson, that's what you still don't get. Its a jibe at Salvini, hoping that he and his (stupid) electorate realise the irony of criticising northern countries for not doing enough.

&gt;Even if he were not who he is, his point is moot. They decided to allow a bunch of Italians in, treated them like shit, 

Piss off, yeah? You really think Italian miners were treated differently to any other miners? In my country Belgium flemish miners in Charleroi were actually treated worse. And yet we still learnt from our lessons, gave these people workers rights, healthcare, education, and one became our PM. And they sent a whole fuckload of wealth made on our soil to their people, who then elect people like Salvini. 

&gt;and now Italy has to accept everyone that wants to come in,

I know that there were a lot more Lithuanians there, but things have changed.

Soviets took the leftover piece, because they were in need of non-freezing, good sea port. Stalin also saw Kaliningrad as his well-deserved prize, and there was no chance he would give it to those *""unthankful for liberation""* Poles.

As I said. Why not do it three times instead ? Just to be sure, best out of three.

&gt;You could just have a referendum on the final deal. That would be fair and much more democratic than on some vague shit.

I fully agree with this, that is how it should have been done. Make a deal for it and then let people vote based on that deal. Sadly it didn't happen and pretty sure EU wouldn't go for that.

&gt;Well so the solution is to let rioters dictate the future of your country?

That is what you'd be doing by making a second referendum this early (Which I am against). You're showing to the population if you're loud enough they will make another referendum. If remain won the second one, what's a single reason that leave voters should just give up and not be the loud as they can to get a third referendum ? There's none unless you wanna be a hypocrite.


I agree with you on the point that it should have been done when there was a deal or at least most of the deal in place. 

Sadly the cat is out of the bag as they say, there has already been a referendum so a second referendum even on the deal day would be very controversial. Especially if another side won and it would be 1:1.

Besides, why should have Italy entered the war on the Central Powers' side when our so-called ally was 1) the one who started said war; 2) unwilling to make any concessions whatsoever; and 3) actually planning to pre-emptively strike the shit out of us by taking advantage of a natural disaster, at that?

I personally don't care that the castle was built for and housed the king/the aristocracy. What I care about is that ordinary people built these structures, often spending years of their short and harsh lives on getting them erected. I am sure many were maimed in that effort, or lost their lives, too.

And this absolute cunt, who claims to be a Communist and leader of working class people, turns around and doesn't spend a single second on the thought that maybe, just maybe, these structures also were a monument to exactly those simple people who erected them.

The same holds for a lot of churches that got torn down in my home city by the regime of the GDR. Sure, you guys were at odds with the church and the old regime. But why the f*ck do you have to tear down structures, where primarily working class people congregated?!

I just can't get it into my head why there was no way, apparently, to redefine and remake these buildings into something to be owned and used by that class of people that originally built them.

There were more atacks that occurred in Turkey, but for those it was uncertain if the motive was Islamist in nature or not. Articles were often in Turkish and the ones that were in English did a poor job of distinguishing if 1) is was the government‚Äôs or media‚Äôs information, and 2) if the accusations had evidence. For these reasons I left about 5 attacks out.

Also worth noting that although I read through most of the news articles on each page, information about citizenship was often unclear. I will say that three Belgian Moroccans and one Chechen/Russian had French citizenship, a Somali and Senegalese had Belgian citizenship, and a Kyrgyzstani-born Uzbek had Russian citizenship.

5675,"The split is an extreme version of the federalisation if the starting point is a highly centralised unitary state--incidentally, in the scenario I envision the newly-formed republics would be federations. The split is necessary because the levels of development between Mezzogiorno and the rest of the country are irreconcilable, thus as independent states both republics would be able to implement monetary, economic and social policies specifically tailored to their strengths and weaknesses.

Moreover, since the fiscal distance between taxpayers and administrative bodies would be curtailed, the level of accountability would increase and, as a result, the institutions would be less wasteful and more transparent.

The Italian state is managed so poorly because it is highly centralised, and such a centralisation is a consequence of the 1861 *m√©salliance* given that until then, save for the kingdom of Sardinia, self-rule in Italy was a novelty and, like now, it was culturally and economically too heterogeneous.

Lastly, it's worth mentioning that such a highly centralised state was perceived as oppressive, especially among southerners, and the Italian economic and monetary union led to the disappearance of the unremarkable industrial base that the Mezzogiorno had.

5755,"Spain's *stravaganza*.

*International*

- As the selling of 400 bombs to Saudi Arabia went ahead, the main excuse the Defence and Foreign Affairs ministers argued after the whole mess-up was that they are ""high precision equipment"".

- Catalan rapper Valtonyc, awaiting extradition in Belgium, declared that he won't probably ever be able to return to Spain (in the supposition he's not extradited) as he's been informed that there're new legal procedures started by Spanish police against him, for his new songs.

*Domestic*

- Politicians *curriculum vitae* fashion week! 1st line politicans, as in the ones that are actually fighting to become PM next elections and the PM himself, accusing each other of having faked curriculums, bought their titles, or having their doctoral thesis done via 'shadow writers'. That‚Äôs the current big thing in the country ‚Äîall started via the work of the most successful left wing online investigation journalism, eldiario.es. A minister actually resigned after being framed by that medium.

- Between this, one of the investigated Universities (Madrid‚Äôs Rey Juan Carlos) says they ""lost"" 6 years of mails, coinciding with the timespan in which many PP politicans got their Master‚Äôs degrees over there.

- Barcelona mayor didn't want to be excluded of the party, and decided to declare that, once into politics, she was ""offered"" by someone the chance to finish her career ""easily"". She then backed up once the University of Barcelona asked her of explanations.

- While Valtonyc is prosecuted again, the National Court dropped a few of the charges to another of the rappers that is facing prison, Pablo Hasel, reduing the sentence from 2 years to 9 months. He‚Äôs got a suspended sentence of 2 years prior this one though, which means that he would need to serve nonetheles (in Spain, and broadly speaking, you only serve if higher than 2 years for a 1st offence).

*Catalonia specific - International*

- Foreign Minister Borrell said that Catalonia ""is a nation"" in a BBC interview, only to start arguing the unique definition Spain has about that ‚Äîthat has been changed over the last years, official dictionary included, to match it‚Äôs political interests as a country.

- Unionist media shared an article, also approved by the Foreign Minister, arguing that the Martin Luther King institute asked of Catalan President Torra and indepenentism of stopping using Luther King‚Äôs fight, reference and ideals for the Catalan cause, deeming the cause not legit. Alas, the next day, the interviewed person released an statement bewildered of having found out his words had been completely turned around, that they‚Äôre proud of anyone using them as referents for non violent fight, and that they‚Äôll always be against of police repression towards just causes. The only thing he said was the logical not knowing exactly the scenario over here, so didn‚Äôt want to know. A textbook fake news case.

Catalonia specific - Domestic

- A ""human tower"" group ([Bordegassos de Vilanova](http://medirflash.com/IMAGES_20/1198.jpg), specificly) released an statement arguing how they were vetoed from an accorded and planned collaboration with the biggest children‚Äôs hospital of Catalonia for a tv spot.

5762,"What do you mean, from the early 90's? The euro wasn't even instroduced in Greece until 2001. There are many reasons why things went the way they did for Greece recently, [but this is my favourite explanation,](https://www.thenational.ae/business/an-economist-explains-the-pros-and-cons-of-a-single-currency-1.184107)

&gt; Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, when Greece had the Drachma, the government mismanaged its finances in two primary ways. First, it ran up a large debt (more than 75 per cent of GDP in the mid-1990s). Second, it used that debt to fund public-sector hiring that featured generous benefits, such as low retirement ages, and that was useless, if not damaging, to the economy. As expected, the drachma‚Äôs value tumbled and inflation and interest rates rose to more than 25 per cent.
&gt; 

&gt; After the global financial crisis of 2008, Greece‚Äôs lenders began to question its creditworthiness and markets started to differentiate between the different eurozone government bonds, with Greece‚Äôs interest rates shooting up beyond 30 per cent. Government insolvency ensued ‚Äì this time the music did stop. If wages didn‚Äôt fall immediately, then unemployment would rise sharply.
&gt; 
&gt; As mentioned last week, wages are stubborn, especially public-sector ones, but a devaluing currency is a good substitute. The single currency ruled that option out but there was the alternative of Greeks relocating to more prosperous parts of the euro zone to ease unemployment. However, cultural barriers, as well as the poor health of the European economy in general, largely scuppered such plans.
&gt; 
&gt; A series of bailouts ensued but they were of limited help because they were designed to bail out the private European banks that had lent to Greece. Greek unemployment now exceeds 20 per cent and it will take a long time for the economy to readjust.
&gt; 
&gt; The Greek government‚Äôs irresponsible spending habits during the past 40 years are the biggest cause of the crisis but the European Commission also played a role by politicising the single currency, which is the mistake that the GCC countries must avoid.

Literally writing in all caps and rambling like a madman.

&gt; You choose to believe their numbers? GOOD FOR YOU! I choose not to. That‚Äôs pretty much it.

It really isn't. You are totally unfamiliar with the numbers, I keep up with them. When I see growth rates this high I see a horror story. You see good news because you're not familiar with the Turkish economy.

&gt;  And since you‚Äôre a god-damn stranger on the internet, and since I suspect you can‚Äôt arrange for me to personally meet the head of TUIK tomorrow so he can give me his personal assurances that Erdogan isn‚Äôt asking him to add pepper or salt to this or that number, and even if he did I wouldn‚Äôt believe him

This is your ignorance showing once again. Checking T√úƒ∞K numbers for their general reliability is quite a simple matter of looking if they're consistent with each other. I don't think you understand how difficult it is to lie about these things without people realizing exactly how you're lying.

This polemic has been a feature of Turkish politics for years now, no economist has actually shown how the numbers are fake.

&gt; And about you getting that last word - at least I was right about that one huh? I bet I could reply pretty much anything by this point, and you‚Äôd keep on going like a headless... well, a headless anything really.

You said you'd stop writing. I'm not taking your claims at face value at this point.

It's not about getting the last word, it's about responding to your allegations. It seems to have worked, you're talking about T√úƒ∞K again.

&gt; One thing you have definitely proved in our short and sweet exchange is your clear talent at ASSUMING

Says the dude who literally called me a paid shill, insulted me by attempting to profile my psyche and classified me as evil.

&gt; Prove me wrong.

That's not how this works. T√úƒ∞K generates a mountain of data. You have to point to what you think is fake and why first. They also release consumer confidence data for example, that clearly shows a massive loss of consumer confidence over the last year or so. Think that's fake too? In the other chain I wrote this, whichever part confuses you, tell me;

&gt; 5% growth in lira terms (indicated by the data to be driven by private consumption) is well within expectation. The lira's recent dive started out only in May and the recent extreme spike happened in August. All that lira liquidity went to growth.    
&gt; What I'm describing is actually worse, since all that growth wasn't healthy, driven by credit growth and unsustainable consumption.""

---

&gt; be anything less than clear here and you‚Äôll go off again about the subtle science of ranking tyrants, dictators and actually-if-you-think-about-it-evil-in-a-good-way leaders like Erdogan with a heart

A got to that because you were unable to comprehend that Erdoƒüan does not micromanage and control everything that the Turkish state does.

The jokes are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical memetics most of the references will go over a typical reader's head. There's also copy-pasta's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into its characterisation - its personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these references, to realise that they're not just funny - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike copy-pasta truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in pasta's existential catchphrase ""What did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.
