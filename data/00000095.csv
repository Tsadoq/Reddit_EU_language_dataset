And let me ask you: If the national constitutions have primacy over EU law, then what stops the states from just rewriting it so that EU law is inapplicable in their countries? What if the Polish government decides to amend their constitution, so that ECJ decisions are only binding if they explicitly agree? That doesn't sound great now, does it?

50,"You started your last comment with ""Thats not and will never be an issue if you stop combining \[butter\] with sugar"", which is a bold statement invalidated by a single exception. Energy density matters. I certainly don't want to split hairs, but while you may *think* that we (I'm assuming you're referring to people that don't thrive without carbs) are the exception, this is an empirical question, it's not about opinion.

If I remember right (but I haven't any of these studies in years), then no carb, while great on paper, does not really result in much better weight when compared to other diets. Whether that's because the theory behind it is incomplete or because avoiding carbs is so restrictive that people just can't stick to it is almost irrelevant.

I don't understand your rock analogy. If you're guaranteed to hit an exception, then how is it an exception? If you mean that everyone is different, then that is true, but under that metric no one is an exception anymore, because everyone is accounted for by the rule. If you are talking about whether no carb does or does not work, then your position was that people like me are the exception, so it would work for the majority. But if it works for the majority, then how would you be guaranteed to hit one of the exceptions?

[Lend-Lease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease)

&gt;The Lend-Lease policy, formally titled An Act to Promote the Defense of the United States (Pub.L. 77‚Äì11, H.R. 1776, 55 Stat. 31, enacted March 11, 1941),[1] was a program under which the United States supplied the United Kingdom (and British Commonwealth), Free France, the Republic of China, and later the Soviet Union and other Allied nations with food, oil, and materiel between 1941 and August 1945. This included warships and warplanes, along with other weaponry. It was signed into law on March 11, 1941, and ended in September 1945. In general the aid was free, although some hardware (such as ships) were returned after the war. 

[Export Control Act 1940](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_Control_Act)

&gt;The Export Control Act of 1940 was one in a series of legislative efforts by the US government and initially the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt to accomplish two tasks: to avoid scarcity of critical commodities in a likely prewar environmen[1] and to limit the exportation of materiel to pre-World War II Imperial Japan. The act originated as a presidential proclamation by Roosevelt forbidding the exporting of aircraft parts, chemicals, and minerals without a license, and it was intended to induce Japan to curtail its occupation of the coast of Indochina.[2]",,/r/europe/comments/gf1urk/how_china_is_losing_europe/fprco8g/,EduTheRed,1588850325

In Poland we've had one of biggest insurers promote and fund organized trainings for runners specifically because as you say it just makes sense financially.

So I hope that one of chief targets of Redditobots will help in this - non profits.   


As a member/part organizer for a bit over a decade, I've found in Poland it's easier to operate in gray area than register an organization. And that puts limits for example on spaces you can rent. And there is very little support without quid pro quo, which often boils down to being at every call from local politicians who want to throw 400 PLN for being listed as organizers and then you still have to do administrative work on your own. In this we've also had a massive help from another non-profit: bunch of lawyers and accountants helping other groups with the paperwork side of things. This could/should be space for government help.   
We're still called as the crew from castle XYZ that is one of three biggest in Poland and Europe and last time we've had a space there was when a member rented it for a business and we squatted at his space. They'd literally rather have those spaces empty than have reenactors use them.

But I think there is also a distinction between entertainment media and actual media. Fox News and the Daily Mail are entertainment media. Most of the crazy bizarre stuff you see on Fox News comes not from their news reports but their entertainment programs.

I do not lose faith in the media in general because of these low quality entertainment programs - although, I do lose faith in my fellow man who watches them as if they were news. I would include The Daily Show in here because I know a lot of people (even in Canada) watch that to get news.

&gt;It is neither dumb nor argument, but stating what happened. And I did so, because you clearly don't understand that ignoring something isn't defending it.


You literally said ""I ignored plenty of comments, that doesn't mean I defended them. That's not how it works."" I'm not letting you escape that easy with a ""it's neither dumb nor argument, but stating what happened"". You don't state anything unless it has a purpose.

Saying that the problem for the EU is not Germany exporting to other EU countries* like original OP claimed* but the problem - ***for the EU*** - is that Germany in contrast to it's exports doesn't import enough. Then I proceeded to explain why Germany exports as much as it does and how the low Euro is related to that.

The German court can now check on the basis of that article whether the authority was exceeded or not. But for that, they need a written reasoning by the ECB which the ECJ has to check in the name of the German court. The court now ruled that it was illegal that that has not happened (the ECJ ruled without a written reasoning by the ECB). 

This is only about authority of one EU institution (ECB) and not about democratic rights which Poland or such would like to avoid. For that, the German court and the ECJ are aligned because the EU basic rights and the German basic rights (and the democratic necessities) also align (it really reads the same for the most part).

652,"you'll want to introduce UBI before unemployment starts rising due to increasing automation, before people become so desperate you get a race to the bottom and knock down the pillars of our prosparity.

now, while i would wish new jobs would be created to offset automation, we can't deny that the speed of automation is increasing, the complexity of new jobs is increasing as well and we already need to create bullshit jobs just to keep people employed,

soon we'll have self driving cars and automated registers and automated delivery systems, just think about how many jobs are on the line there, and those are jobs people with lower intelligence can still do, newer jobs will be more complex, it will be almost impossible to get those people (and we are talking millions in belgium and NL alone) into more complex, likely machine/it related jobs. we'll either have to pay em to do bullshit jobs or start cutting down on labour hours or put more people into unemployment systems (UBI in this case), or a combination of both.

already certain groups, like autistic people or people with low stress tolerance are failing to compete in this society, an ever rising group of people simply can't keep up with increased demands from ever more complex jobs, at some point we'll have to change how this system works, we can't keep going at it. we had a good run, but it's time for something new.

we have been trough things like this before, we stopped forcing children into labour, dispite factory owners crying out this would make them lazy and cause mass poverty, turns out it did neither, we adapted to a new situation and all came out better. perhaps we need a new evolution in how we do things, a new way of distributing resources and labour. just like we got the kids out of the factories and into schools, maybe we should get people out of bullshit jobs and into other things, there's a serious problem with absentee parents, i already see a good use for people in that field, simply being a parent, ensuring the next generation isn't as horrible as the current ones are.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/gelqbn/a_better_world_can_emerge_after_coronavirus_or_a/fppqqwl/,thenewsheogorath,1588807333

814,"&gt; Yes. I don't fucking care it's highly upvoted.

Of course not, since it's a comment you liked. So therefore no reason to be critical of that comment.

&gt;&gt;So, everyone just ignored it? But then when I didn't ignore it, you get hypercritical of my argument?

&gt;I have no idea what you are trying to say.



Of course you understand, your dishonesty prevents you from understanding it.  I'm arguing that you and everyone that is ignoring it and just upvoting weren't critical of it because but were critical of anyone that disagreed because you people were defending that original claim ""US is HIGHLY corrupt"".

&gt;&gt;You ignored a highly upvoted comment because you agree with it and attacked a mostly ignored comment because you were defending the original argument.

&gt;No, we don't know that. I know it isn't true and you only think it's true.


We don't know that you ignored the highly upvoted comment that I was replying to? GFTO with your dishonesty. Clearly you read that highly upvoted comment and you refused to be critical of their statement. 

&gt; I ignored plenty of comments, that doesn't mean I defended them. That's not how it works.


But any comment you do reply to, you are ignoring the parent comments if you aren't critical of those. Are you really lacking this much intelligence or just being dishonest. I never argued you ignored all the comments you didn't respond to -- I'm arguing you ignored the comment I was responding to which you clearly did read and you clearly did not respond to them and hold the same level of standard. 

**So, why are you making dumb arguments such as ""I ignored plenty of comments, that doesn't mean I defended them.""???**



&gt;There are plenty of racist pricks saying racist bullshit. They also aren't very creative about it, after some time you get to know all their ""arguments"". Trying to convince them is usualy pointless. However if someone argues against them, but does so poorly, it's counterproductive. And that annoys me, prompting my reaction.

&gt;They would be stuck with their governments,

The majority of Hungarian people voted for that fascist lover.  They love him. Not all of them but a majority of them. The Hungarians have no one to blame but themselves and their culture that worships ""traditional nationalist beliefs"".

This notion that dictators come into power solely by themselves and the populace are just completely innocent victims who were unfortunately caught up in this whole situation is a lie that must stop.

The overwhelming majority of dictators maintain power through the support of the common folk. Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Chavez, Castro, Nasser, Saddam, Assads, Putin, Saudis, Emiratis, Mobutu, Pinochet all heavily relied on the poor and middle class citizens supporting them economically, militarily and politically. Dictators can't just imprison and kill 50% of their population and expect to remain in power. 

And before anyone responds and says, ""but but but! Pol Pot! He killed 25%!"" He did, and his regime fell after 4 years while the previous dictators I just listed lasted much longer.

&gt;and the international community would have even less of an ability to pressure them to reform outside the EU than inside it.

Your argument completely misses the point. People who are advocating towards kicking hungary out of the EU is the ""pressure inside"" you were just talking about. By actually (not bluffing) threatening to kick Hungary out of the EU while they are currently in it, you can get the far radical rightwing regimes to reluctantly cooperate.

Bankruptcy is a release, that old Hollywood trope where a bunch of men with trucks show up and take everything your own is just that, a trope. Often times people simply consolidate their debt into a payment plan, and if they complete that plan their debts are released regardless if all of that debt is actually paid off by the plan or not. This is called a Chapter 13.

Even if that isn't an option you're not tossed out on the street to be homeless, if you do have to go with a Chapter 7 you keep most of your belongings, your job, your home and vehicle.

And claim how communism is the solution to the problems of capitalism. There are literally people in this treat trying to change an opinions about USSR in peoples mind from baltics, where almost everybody knew some ""enemy of the state"" back then. It is super ironic how some rich kid from california is going to teach eastern europeans about how wrong they are about USSR and how they are victim of US right wing propaganda.

There is no record of any functional not totalitarian communist country in the world as far as i know. Not at the moment and nowhere in the past. And I think there is a very good reason for that, because it is not possible. It is not like no one ever tried, because they did on half of this planet.

So as far as i am concerned, this communism thing is just a mental exercise. It is fun to talk about, but it is not applicable in real life, at least not in current state of human evolution. Because the idea denies reality pretty much, it denies basic human behavioral patterns, it denies biology, anthropology.... pretty much every FACT we know about human race trough the whole history.

Is this inherent in communism or country specific. People can leave Vietnam, Venezuela, China, etc just fine. 

&gt;You may have heard of a thing called the Berlin Wall. Migration policies in the USSR were far more repressive than any liberal nation. If you're lucky, you may be able to obtain an exit-visa to live abroad, but you were always and forever subject(property) of the state.

I have to pay my government to be able to travel. No its not the same as the Berlin wall or eastern block. But again, is this inherent in communism? My I offer another solution? I contend it is not a result of communism but instead a result of Russia wanting to balance itself against the west. Geopolitical factors, not communism. 

&gt;Nationalized healtcare is hardly a restriction on free enterprise, it can be categorized alongside other state servants such as police, firefighters, judges and representatives. 

Yes it is, you can't open a Healthcare insurance firm, how is that not a restricton. I can't think of a single capitalist nation on earth that doesn't ban certain businesses. 

&gt;In a Capitalist country,  you could make fingerpaintings and sell them for a profit if someone would buy it. The very concept of this is itself antithetical to the entire ideology of Communism, both because it entails the concept of property and because it entails profit. THAT is why people are slaves. 

Well I have to apply for a business permit with the government, setup tax information to pay the government, follow all business regulations in my industry. So no I can't just start selling finger paintings, the capitalist government would jail me. 

What if humans are the product? I can sell other humans to make a profit for myself. By your definition everyone in that transaction is free.

1020,"&gt; Part 1: that‚Äôs inaccurate. SU was in no way communism at its best.

It was able to compete with the US in the space race, beat a more industrial Germany and make nukes all on its own. Other commie countries fell to the cia. 

&gt; The reason society puts them together in western culture is because our great grand parents and grand parent and parents lived through that time and the only way to unfit people against the authoritarian dictatorships taking over the world was to label them with a common word, which was the word they used, because it was the word their people wanted to hear. 

Yeah that isn‚Äôt why. During the Cold War the whole idea was between ideologies, proving that capitalism and liberal democracy is better than communism and authoritarianism. 

This debate played out ever where, west v East Berlin. West v East Germany. North an South Korea later on. And even in Vietnam. The whole point was to see if people having less freedom turned out more better countries than people having more freedoms 

&gt; Part deux: we don‚Äôt have to continue this discussion, we will never agree on this.

Lmao, your notion is that the SU only called themselves communist same way NK calls itself democratic. But they just didn‚Äôt call themselves communist, they were communist. The state controlled everything, Stalinism is based on communism. 

Did they achieve total classless society as you need in true communism? No, but that‚Äôs isn‚Äôt because they never tried to, they did.

Complete individual freedom must be restrained somehow to avoid such aggression, whether by a state or by expectation of self defence, the latter being unavailable to many.

But to get back to the point of the thread, there has never been a communist state. Why? Well, on of the defining characteristics of communism is a stateless society with an implementation of direct democracy. As far as I am aware that has never been attempted on a large scale of a country. It has been done in small scales, like single towns or communes. And in those examples it has worked. 

A state (country) as we define it today can not be communist, but it can be socialist. And plenty of socialist countries and political parties have and continue to exist today without falling to authoritarianism.

I mean technically you brought it up and now you're whinging about a hypothetical  conversation that hasn't even happened yet.

But while we are on the subject you are right, technically it isn't genocide.

1142,"I believe that all leaders should be evaluated with both their good parts and their bad parts equally examined so a combined and objective verdict can be reached on whether they were good or bad in the end. Stalin did lead his country through World War Two and the USSR did come out as the winner in that conflict, but you cannot ignore the fact that Stalin initially cooperated with Hitler to carve up Eastern Europe and annex the independent nations in the region either, for instance, not to mention the fact World War Two was not all that there is to say about Stalin's rule or all that happened under it.

Stalin did massively industrialize Russia, but I'd argue that the industrialization of Russia and massively increasing the quality of life could have come without the political and cultural repression and totalitarian police state. For example, while Mao did industrialize his China, it is the approach of opening up China to capitalism and trade under Deng Xiaoping that resulted in the country being the world's second largest economy, with millions being lifted out of poverty.

Of course not all Russians are communists, but still, the point of the argument was that there indeed are people who justify the atrocities of those dictators one way or the other - saying they did some other good things so they're fine indeed means justifying the bad parts.

By Marxist-Leninist states, as I said, I mean those that identified as such.

At first the [competing operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuovo_Trasporto_Viaggiatori) was even backed up by SNCF, and many thought it was a way to keep a foot on the Italian market, later SNCF had its own issues and Italo had become strong enough to live on its own.

In the beginning Trenitalia was ruthless in trying to stop them, and in that it was indeed helped by the national rail infrastructure owner (RFI, which years before together with Trenitalia made up the State Railways Agency) in ways that most probably were not even completely fair, but on the long run they had to budge and now they coexist pretty peacefully. I guess SNCF will try to do the same once Trenitalia will enter the French market, even more since they will do it by threatening SNCF crown jewels :P

As a Croatian I envy you so much about this. The situation here regarding fascist and communist regimes is so polarised that bringing the crimes of one group automatically labels you as a supporter of the other regime. Both of them are horrible and glorification of any totalitary regime is pure brainwash.

1390,"If you're completely ignoring reality, then the discussion exists on an utopian plane that's disconnected from the real world, which could often make the eventual outcome of this discussion inapplicable to the real world. We have seen several different interpretations of communism applied in the real world, and the track record is dreadful, as they frequently result in human suffering. 

The most important aspect of any economic or political system is the actual real world application. It's easy to create an ideology, where you simply claim that everyone will have everything they need, and no one will be oppressed in any manner. Stating that is an incredibly easy thing to do, but actually making it happen is what ultimately matters, as that's the ultimate test. Communism has repeatedly failed that test. I don't know how many more beta runs people require, before they admit that this communist ideology simply doesn't work well in the real world.

You're obviously going to attack capitalism, but the reality is that capitalism has been more succesful in its application, even if isn't perfect. We could simply look at most western countries. It simply has a much better track record, because it accounts much more effectively for human nature, as it doesn't exist on this utopian plane to the same degree as communism.

If climate change continues its current path, and if our efforts to mitigate it continue to fail as they have since the Kyoto Protocol of 1992, very soon we won't have much of an economy, either.

1609,"&gt;I ignored original comment because it's boring. I responded to yours because it is annoying.



""I ignored original comment because it's boring""....for a highly upvoted comment? So, everyone just ignored it? But then when I didn't ignore it, you get hypercritical of my argument? GTFO. 

You're a dishonest lying hypocrite. We know you ignored the highly upvoted comment because you were defending them. You've literally argued that.


&gt;One does not need reason not to act. Why should I respond to that original comment?

One does not need to do anything...free will and all. But what one does says a lot about them. You ignored a highly upvoted comment because you agree with it and attacked a mostly ignored comment because you were defending the original argument. 

I'll use an analogy to demonstrate my point:

Person A: Black people are naturally extremely lazy people 

Me: Not true at all. Check out this study that indicates they are regular lazy like others. 

You: (ignore person A but respondes to me) Well, your study is showing perceived lazyiness. Sure it takes input from experts and the population but it doesn't really mean much

Me: It's not perfect but it's the best evidence we have. why are you defending Person A? 

You: 

1. I'm not defending them. I take no position. But yet I will state some arguments to defend them...but still, I'm not taking a position.
2. There is nothing wrong that I gave a free pass to the highly upvoted comment I agree with since it's BORING while I become super focused and critical of your barely read reply stating the opposite. 
3. Who cares if you at least provided the best source on this topic - it doesn't prove person A is wrong. Person A doesn't have to provide a source for it to be true. Furthermore, it's now no longer a factual statement but an opinion so a source doesn't matter. 

So your cop out is basically ""eh, highly upvoted comment is boring and I just don't want to respond to them but I want to be hyper critical with you even though hardly anyone saw your comment.....because I disagree with your comment, though at the same time I'm not taking a position""

So what could have we done ? Let khadafi enter in Mistrata and purge the city ? Lybia was on the verge to be a 2nd Syria however. Eliminate Khadaffi created a shitlot of issue and I understand that Sarkozy had other goal in mind as well, but please, stop telling yourself that without this intervention, the situation would have been better.

Lybia is in a relatively better shape than Syria at the moment. There is no mass genocide neither use of chemical weapon. 

Better be rational and try to avoid the worst in the area.
Yes, Malia is former colony of France and they have more interest than others european countries, yes the temporary collapsing of the Lybian state have worsen the already existing trouble in the area.

Best i could tell, he considered it fantastic for bootstrapping industry.

But that at a certain point, likely at some crisis that capitalism seem to have at irregular intervals, there could be potential for a shift away from chasing ever larger profits and instead use the production capacity to provide more leisure time.

And we keep seeing murmurs about taking the work day down to 6 hours, or more recently a citizens wage to allow for not having everyone working.

On that note there is a funny observation by Marx, found in the later volumes that Engels assembled from the notes he left behind, where he distinguish between industry owning capitalists and rentier capitalists (landlords, bankers, etc).

Marx observed that in times of crisis in capitalism, it would benefit the industrial capitalists to side with their workers against the rentiers. But that they invariably do so far too late.

It probably doesn't apply to academics (or at least I hope it doesn't), but it was bizarre to learn that someone working as an English Lit specialist in a library (with an English Lit PhD) still had to do it. I remember him saying he got paid for it, so that's great, but at that level, on-the-job training is probably enough.

The other thing was that it's probably incredibly difficult for someone coming from outside the German system to be hired for certain jobs, regardless of experience, because they can't check the apprenticeship box. That means that some highly qualified people are going to look elsewhere.

It's hard to sell mali mission when everyone knows what a clusterfuck Libya was. France has an historical interest to deploy in those regions but that doensn't go for Germany (and a lot of other European countries, I am sure you were not only turned down by Germany).

1758,"Yeah such people unfortunately exist. Eastern Turkey has hard terrain, high elevation and rough climate made many villages and cities unreachable (especially in winter many of them are isolated fron outer world for months) which made bringing essential services to those regions especially hard. The lack of reliable basic services (even electricity and plumbing) and lack of education unfortunately let really backwards ideas to thrive in those regions. Also non-ending conservative governments benefited from the suffering of those people. Uneducated and poor people are less likely to question things especially the government. It made winning elections far easier for them.

For 30 - 34 we are talking about around 90s and late 80s. PKK and its terrorism was at its peak around that time. Since government neglected the region unfortunately terrorist groups could easily penerate villages and buy themselves legitimacy by helping those villages. When government was distant and almost non-existant for those people PKK was there for them. It was not free for them though. Many people were forced to join PKK and got killed by military in numerous fightings. Villages and civilians were often used as cover. When goverment increased the services provided in the East by obligating teachers and doctors and other government officers to serve East, PKK abducted and killed those educated people and sabotaged infrastructure. 

Those were really hard times for some people there. Many villages had hardly enough living conditions, no proper industry, no roads and sometimes no infrastructure at all. Some of them lived just above Medieval with manual labor. In 90s most of the stuff has started to change for the better with groving economy, increasing trade with neighboring countries and constant aids. Eastern Turkey is much much better now. On the other hand many villages are suffering from heavy migration and population loss. Corrupt AKP government made earning one's life extremely hard for farmers and animal breeders by putting quotas and limiting the credits. Farming was still the primary source of income of the majority in 90s. It is not anymore. Those people migrated to big cities like Istanbul, Ankara and ƒ∞zmir.

C'mon dude.

Have you ever heard of people leaping over barbed wire, or crawling in the sewers, or trying really anything imaginable to leave soviet union and join any western country? Manyof them were killed by soviet ""liberators"".

Talking about Russia, that regime was the death of any democratic growth in the country for decades, and the ultimate cause of russian economic fail in the long run.

The soviet party had strengh and support, this is what usually happens to the ruling party in a totalitarism (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Communist China), but only using force and terror against russians during his rise.

They reached their goal after killing milions of russians during russian civil war, after murdering those russians who were trying to have freedom and to avoid a dictatorship after February Revolution, after applying every kind of repression during Red Terror to enslave the population. At that point the majority of russians (who were just trying to survive) stopped to revolt.

It's the same story in every regime: in the end, many people begin to accept whoever has to force to submit them, and start to cooperate. See what happened in nazi Germany or Italy or China.

You cannot call this trash ""liberation"", it's just a bad joke.

maybe you can consider cultural context as well. what you explain certainly applies to a specific culture and a specific time frame, considering human history, but is by no means universal. and if so, where do you get this information from please? large parts of most nations today are based on capitalism, yes. but what you are doing seems like historical revisionism in order to portray it as an inherent part of all the societies, not just the one we (and that excludes quite a few other societies) live in now. that's just plain wrong, I'm afraid.
Seriously, what kind of position are you in to make claims about the ""natural"" behavior and inclinations of ALL the people? or the logical structure, symbols of wealth are in cultures, so these cultures are capitalist? one has nothing to do with the other at all, individual wealth is not an inherent part of a privatized economy. one could argue that it is exactly the opposite, unless you see it as the individual wealth of very, very few people.

What they missed is that said 2018 ruling ( [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=208741&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=1393521](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=208741&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=1393521) ) based it's recommendation on restrictions that they completely stopped following a month ago:

&amp;#x200B;

1:

\*On 22¬†January 2015, the Governing Council decided that asset purchases should be expanded to include a secondary markets public sector asset purchase programme (hereinafter the ‚ÄúPSPP‚Äù). Under the PSPP the \[national central banks\], in proportions reflecting their respective shares in the ECB‚Äôs capital key, and the ECB may purchase outright eligible marketable debt securities from eligible counterparties on the secondary markets\*

The capital key has been abandoned - the ECB buys bonds as they seem fit now.

&amp;#x200B;

2:

\*The PSPP is a proportionate measure for mitigating the risks to the outlook on price developments, as it will further ease monetary and financial conditions, including those relevant to the borrowing conditions of euro area non-financial corporations and households, thereby supporting aggregate consumption and investment spending in the euro area and ultimately contributing to a return of inflation rates to levels below but close to 2% over the medium term. In an environment where key ECB interest rates are at their lower bound, and purchase programmes focusing on private sector assets are judged to have provided measurable, but insufficient, scope to address the prevailing downside risks to price stability, it is necessary to add to the Eurosystem‚Äôs monetary policy measures the PSPP as an instrument that features a high transmission potential to the real economy. Thanks to its portfolio re-balancing effect, the sizable purchase volume of the PSPP will contribute to achieving the underlying monetary policy objective of inducing financial intermediaries to increase their provision of liquidity to the interbank market and credit to the euro area economy.\*

The so-called ""transmission potential to real economy"" is not real at all - there's absolutely no evidence that financing nations debt unconditionally starts the economy. And to start the economy we have the ESM directly financing companies.

&amp;#x200B;

3:  \*facilitating credit provision to the euro area economy, easing borrowing conditions of households and firms\*

The borrowing conditions for households are at all time low since years. As are the conditions for firms. The problem is banks do not give out credits with low solvancy. The money transfers absolutely NOT into the economy. Even at a 90% state gurantee companies struggle to receive loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Add to that DMZ agreements are normally for an specified time or goal, makes it somewhat more dubious that Turkey as an non-signatory of the transfer can call upon the details within the treaty. Plus, unless I'm really mistaken, the DMZed status of the islands for Italy was a result of the Italian participation in World War II on the side of the Axis and a way to curb any possible aggressive post-war behaviour.

With the mutual aggression between Greece and Turkey since WW2  with since the 90's being it mostly Turkish aggressive manoeuvres and the lifting of the previous DMZed status of parts of Turkey which were a result of the Treaty of Lausanne, which got lifted in the 30s, it'd be somewhat strange to keep the islands as a permanent demilitarized zone.

capitalism is prehistoric. Prehistory ended at the first written word, at which point history began. We have coins and evidence of trade from before that time.

First, absolutely all those countries were poor as fuck, and the moment they decided to be socialists they got sieged by the wealthy and developed countries.

Second, take any exemples of the ones you're thinking about, and i guarantee you they couldn't make their own version of socialism, they had to abide to the authoritarian soviet model because of historical, economic and political situation. The only way a country could be socialist in the 20 century was if they had support from the USSR, that demanded the parties to follow the stalinist authoritarian stance. Even the cuban and chinese revolutions couldn't make their own version of socialism. China later would part ways with the USSR, but in the beggining they went full on stalinists, since they depended heavily on USSR support.

I suspect that the next revolutions will be quite different from the ones did before, just because there is no soviet union anymore.

Ill give you an example though. In germany every apprentice has to write down every day a short summary of what he did that day and in the end this foulder gets given to them. Now this document gets signed by someone in the company and theoretically the companies should be held accountable if they dont do a good job of teaching their apprentices and basically use them as cheap labour (they're contractually obligated to actually provide education to some standard).
 Now I dont know if its always been this way but this document just gets full on ignored nowadays and you as an apprentice basically write a little protocol every day so it gets thrown out at the end. 

(Not only) this, but the lack of company-side control has lead to many companies just using apprentices as cheap labor and leaving them to themselves/the school in terms of education, even though they are obligated to provide you with education (and dont think im being harsh on companies, they get further advantages from that deal). 

Oh and just to be clear theres still great companies that try theiir very best its just the stories that some of my clasmates tell are horrible.

The ECB is an EU institution, its mandate and reason to be is entirely within EU law. If the germans do not agree with the mandate, that is a reasonable position to have (I don't agree with it, but I see the point), but that mandate has to be changed from within the ECB. It is certainly not up to the German Constitutional Court to rule on that. But then again, there is no majority for turning the ECB into a super-Bundesbank inside the ECB governing council and there is such widespread opposition to ECB policies in Germany that the Court decided such a move was warranted.

It was not. It is not legal (they have no jurisdiction on EU law and can certainly not say that CJEU rulings are invalid), it is not correct and it is certainly not a savvy political move. This reeks of desperation and refusing to play by the rules. The worst in this situation is that Germany/the German Constitutional Court knows that it is big enough that this will be heard across EU and that there will be no repercussions. As other commenters have said at other places in this comment section, imagine the uproar (and certainly in Germany, but in many other countries as well) if the highest courts in Hungary or Poland would declare CJEU rulings not valid.

Basically, the court forces the German state to do stuff it always could have done if it was willing to face the consequences of the actions, same is true with Poland and Hungary.

2171,"They're considered lower secondary studies (ISCED level 2), but not fully completing secondary studies as a whole (ISCED level 3)

In Finland *lukio* (Swedish *gymnasium*) is also technically preparation for college/polytechnics/university (Bachelor's or higher, basically), but my main point is that either that or vocational school (*ammattikoulu* = literally ""job/profession school"", it teaches you to do a specific job like a mechanic or carpenter or hairdresser) are expected from everyone. Both are usually 3 years and from age 15-18, but people can start school a year early/late, and lukio can technically be done in anything from 2-4 years I think. Lukio generally gets officially translated to English as ""upper secondary school"", matching the ISCED definitions, and in informal online discussions in English like this one is usually as ""high school"" , since that's the easiest analogue, understandable from American pop culture etc.

The ""primary education"" for ISCED are grades 1-9, in Finland split into grades 1-6 for primary school (ISCED level 1) and lower secondary school for grades 7-9 (ISCED level 2). That pretty much exactly matches the ISCED descriptions for those levels too.

The problem isn't the ISCED definitions IMO, it's that (as I already wrote in another comment) this map is using ""most common"", because pluralities can be misleading: it could theoretically be 60% tertiary, 39% secondary and 1% with only primary education, or some country could have 40% tertiary (still decent), 1% secondary, and 39% primary. With Spain specifically there is the other problem is that the standard for when school is done is at ISCED level 2 in Spain, but a full secondary education by the usual ISCED definitions, by law in some countries (if you have to go to school until 18), and by cultural norms in Finland for example, is ISCED level 3.

I propose some experimental philosophy: 
Go to your local woods and gather some berries/firewood. Go to a local farmer and exchange that for some potatoes/beans. With that you will learn that:

1. You can produce goods with your body and no additional capital. Capital only makes this more efficient.
2. Resources without entrepreneurship and labour are not worth anything. The farmer will not give you anything if you just walk up to him and say ""There is firewood in the woods."" (Resources without labor are useless) he will also not give you anything if you just gather your goods and go home (labour without entrepreneurship are worth nothing - there is no trade, however you have produced goods you can use). 
3. A trade only happens when both sides are happy with the bargain. I'm sure that farmer will wish you on your merry way if you demand that he gives you his house for the berries. So will you, if he offers you a single rotten potato.

This is a misinterpretation of Marx and quite insult for the man. The reason we have all these things is because of the workers who protested and organised strikes and a lot of them even died for it. Marx was the man who inspired the movement and helped to guide it and reshape the movement to acquire Marxists tendencies. But he wasn't the only one, anarchist writers inspired millions as well and urged them to act, which they did. People were fighting before Marx for their rights, his work just helped them to unify through his work. Marx explicitly stated that the revolution needs to come from the people on the bottom, the workers not the educated individuals such as was him. You can clearly see this in the Russian revolution of 1917 and the Paris commune, which the later Marx criticised as failing to understand Socialism, as they replaced one government with a other.

As long as you did something remotely similar in the past you still have a pretty good chance, even without a degree. That can be an internship, portfolio or even running your own company for a while.

While I was running HR, a degree was mostly used to get a bigger paycheck. But due to that we straight up ignored many applicants with a master's degree - they just asked for to much and weren't worth the money. In a way they were overqualified although their skills rarely matched their degree, especially in software engineering.

Imo in Germany you should either get a bachelor's degree or you just build up some sort of portfolio.

All documentaries, shows, debates and discussions always show the USA or the Western allies winning the war. This of course due to a fixation on D-day since that is the thing that freed us. However, this meant that either the Eastern front was forgotten, or as is happening now, the Eastern front is shown on equal footing to the western front.

What this means is that people see the western front as a war rather as the tiny puny little battle that it actually was compared to the enormous operations that occurred on the Eastern front. It has been a huge source of frustration to me because due to games like battle brothers, medal of honor and the early call of duty's I was convinced it was a war between nazis and Americans (with some other westerners strewn in out of pity). Then as I grew older I watched documentaries and I retained this concept. I heard of some Eastern front but never learned any details from it. At teenager-age did I first start studying (as a hobby) world war 2 and did I get acquainted with this thing that happened in the east (the thing being the actual damn war). It doesn't help that all the docus about the east are mostly in Russian. The weight of the reality really only sank in once I compared the numbers and scales of the battles. The disparity is INSANE! The western front was nothing in comparison. All it did was seal the doom for Germany faster (the Russians were already advancing into Germany and the nazis were already doomed) and free the west from USSR influence (which is good).

&gt;AKP and PKK were having peace talks in Oslo and Erdoƒüan himself said ""I am trampling Turkish nationalism"". 

Sure, he hates the modern Turkish nation state. We would much prefer to go back to the pre 1923 caliphate.

The Russian also used a lot of automatic weapons, much more compared to Germans. Which made them really effective in close combat so the sovjets had to get closer to use their weapons most effective. 

Soldiers were almost never executed for retreating. It were mostly about the officers that would not follow orders and would do whatever they felt like, but even those didn't get executed as much as people would believe. 

In the beginning of the war, the Germans outnumbered the sovjets by almost 2/1. Which caused an egregious amount of casualties in the first 2 years of the war.

2484,"Firstly, they did win the war so your latter point just isn‚Äôt correct

Secondly, in fact the Russian leadership wasn‚Äôt idiotic and barbarians, the major difference between the US and UKs military engagements and the Soviet engagements was that the Soviets were fighting for their survival, on their own ground - they couldn‚Äôt retreat and try again another day, they couldn‚Äôt take their time and 3 years to land in Normandy.  The Nazis had no intention of allowing the USSR and it‚Äôs citizens to live normal lives, they would have cleansed it and moved in.  I don‚Äôt think we can ever conflate what the soviets were fighting for and on the receiving end of to the British and especially the US, who were always safe from German invasion. 

Thirdly, the actual scale of the fighting on the eastern front is the principle reason for the soviet casualties. The majority came during the early years and encirclements, whereas in France the country surrendered and these encircled troops survived, in the East they couldn‚Äôt surrender, and the Nazis killed these prisoners.

Until the 1980s, the D-Day commemorations were essentially military: heads of state were not represented. Their establishment after the war owes much to Raymond Triboulet, MP for Calvados and several times Minister of Veterans Affairs. No American president came to the Normandy beaches before Ronald Reagan (except for Jimmy Carter in 1978, but privately, without ceremony). The turning point came with Fran√ßois Mitterrand who, in 1984, transformed the military ceremony of the time into a political ceremony to which the heads of state were invited. 

As early as 1945, there were celebrations in Normandy and this was due to the French MPs from the region. And the Americans never came before Ronald Reagan.

    *Those mining communities had good working class values and a sense of family values. The men did real men's heavy work going down the pit. There were also some very close-knit communities which were able to deal with the few troublesome kids. If they had any problems they would take the kid round the back and give them a good clip round the ear and that would be the end of that. Many of these communities were completely devastated, with people out of work turning to drugs and no real man's work because all the jobs had gone. There is no doubt that this led to a breakdown in these communities with families breaking up and youths going out of control. The scale of the closures went too far. The damage done to those communities was enormous as a result of the strike.[89]*

Ehm... That's some way to look at it I guess? So the gender who is, you know, dying the most is apparently not the most affected?

Also, a ton of people praised Angela Merkel for her handling and explanation of the virus and measures recently, and applauded her being a world leader with a scientific background. But sure, if you focus only on the Trumps of the world, you'll only see men handling things badly.

And if 85% of single parents are women, does that tell us that women are being left with the responsibility of childcare, or does it also tell us that maybe we should stop seeing the woman as the pretty much default choice by the courts to raise the kids after a divorce for example?

And next up, with the economic crisis hitting hard in a while, how will homeless and suicide numbers look where men are always overrepresented?

Unlikely, but out of those 3 only China has any real economy to actually support large scale war effort. Russia has 12-15 times smaller GDP than US or EU (so almost 30 when compared to entire NATO), Turkey is half that. So while they can try to intimidate some small neighboring countries, they are simply not in the same league.  Even if you exclude US, the combined military spending of European NATO countries is 5x larger than what Russia spends.

Therefore China is the only one which could realistically be a challenge, with significant military spending and strong economy behind it.

2674,"The problem is not the chlorination.  This is entirely safe.

The problem is why chlorination is used in the first place, to disinfect the poultry.

In the EU (where the UK will be in this later is for everyone else to decide), there's no need for it as the processes we employ are so strong (and costly) that we don't need to disinfect them.

One of the easiest methods to see if one of the systems is better or worse is to look at salmonella, as it's an illness that's caused by bad hygiene during food handling and is, at least in the EU, responsible for 50% of all food borne disease outbreaks.

The CDC in the US reports 420 deaths and 26k hospitalizations due to it each year.

 [https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/index.html) 

Meanwhile in the EU, the deaths due to salmonella were 10 in 2016 with 1766 hospitalizations required.

2791,"[This seems like an interesting article](https://warontherocks.com/2016/07/determined-by-history-why-sweden-and-finland-will-not-be-more-than-nato-partners/) on the reason why. 

&gt;In the middle of the 1990s, Sweden and Finland joined NATO‚Äôs Partnership for Peace (PfP) together with Russia and several other countries who are now NATO members. The objective of PfP was to offer countries a way to develop their individual relations to NATO. However, as James Goldgeier touched in yesterday at War on the Rocks, most of the countries that joined, arguably used PfP as a route toward future NATO membership. Sweden, Finland, and Russia have, however, just used PfP as a vehicle for cooperation. The 2008 war in Georgia and Russia‚Äôs more recent invasion of Ukraine have changed this dynamic. The two Nordic countries are now doing whatever they can to improve their security and their relations with NATO short of actually applying for membership.  

&gt;To understand the context of these choices, it is necessary to look back into history to get an appreciation for the events, values, and geopolitics that still form basis of Swedish and Finnish security policy. The two countries are closely linked ‚Äî  Finland constituted the eastern half of Sweden until 1809, when Sweden ceded Finland to Russia with the Treaty of Fredrikshamn. This marked the end of several hundred years of wars between Sweden and Russia for hegemony over the Baltic Sea. Sweden had tried to control the sea its trade routes, while Russia aimed to expand its window to the West, having been previously relegated to just a small strip of land near St. Petersburg. For Sweden, the peace meant a drastic shortening of its vulnerable land border with Russia.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/gdnx7u/military_strength_of_some_eastern_european/fpj8kzh/,nlx78,1588659880

Not sure there's much point in having NATO [officially anyway] if this is the response from members. It's founding principle has always been if one member state is attacked it's considered an attack against all.

Because the US has been decisive in it's own foreign affairs for many decades, it has meant most NATO allies in Europe have been able to keep a low profile and  there is now a reliance on the US - which is not right.

Since its peak in 2012 (40%), the ability to handle unexpected expenses has improved markedly. Due to lockdown implemented across the world in 2020 to slow down the rapid spread of the coronavirus, the ability to face unexpected financial expenses is crucial, especially in case of loss of income. ¬†

The highest shares of people unable to face unexpected financial expenses was reported among single person households: 40% of single persons were unable to face unexpected financial expenses, and in particular 56% of single persons with children. Higher shares were recorded for single females (43%) than for single males (36%).

In contrast, the lowest shares were recorded in households with two adults: 25% were unable to face unexpected financial expenses; 28% of two adult households with one dependent child and 26% of those with two dependent children.

Among all household types, the proportion of people unable to face unexpected financial expenses was lowest for two adults, of whom at least one is 65 or over (24%).

Among the EU Member States, the share of people unable to face unexpected financial expenses was highest in Croatia (52%), followed by Latvia (50%), Greece and Cyprus (both 48%), Lithuania (47%) and Romania (44%).

2949,"You can't just look at growth levels because they won't explain why Britain remains to be the only developed nation to ask for a loan from the IMF (1976). The book, [Goodbye, Great Britain](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300057287/goodbye-great-britain), is worth reading if you're interested. The loan wasn't requested because of public spending getting out of control (despite the book description) but because there was a complete collapse in confidence in Sterling due to a couple of factors - the OPEC crisis (which every country was dealing with anyway) but also our out of control labour markets which made investment in technology near enough an impossibility (I'll touch on this later on). You truly don't understand the militancy displayed by the unions in the 70s. In Britain we had more than two times the number of strikes in France in the 70s. I can only wish we took a German/Scandinavian approach where unions were more cooperative but unions in Britain have a far more aggressive relationship with employers than anywhere else in the developed world (or they used to anyway). Everyone's aware of the Winter of Discontent in 78-79 but the early 70s was horrible as well, mainly due to strikes against ""containerisation"" where cargo boxes pretty much revolutionised world trade. This is one big example where Britain decided not to adopt better technology because of job losses. If you've got the patience for it then watch [The Box That Changed Britain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIEH0Db0XVc), otherwise you can read this [short article which gives a decent summary of it](https://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/173470/Box-that-changed-the-world). Before containers, over 100 men would deal with the offloading of goods but only 15 men were needed to deal with containers. Containerisation led to the famous case of the [Pentonville Five](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/archives_online/speakingarchives/pentonville/), workers that were arrested for illegally striking against containers. This led to sympathy strikes across the entire country resulting in all ports becoming immobilised and all public transport shut down. Given this is a Thatcher thread, ironically enough no milk was available in the first week of when the sympathy strikes began because milk was almost exclusively delivered by drivers in the Transport and General Workers' Union, a union which joined in on the sympathy strikes. Why would anyone invest in a country where it always seems to be on the edge of industrial collapse because of strikes?

Containers didn't just affect British ports, they also had a significant impact on British manufacturing. I'll highlight some key parts from the article I mentioned above but the gist of it is, it exposed British manufacturing to true global competition for the first time.

&gt;In 1956, cargo was loaded and unloaded by hand, with dockers often using hooks. Freight costs accounted for around 30 per cent of the price of foreign goods ‚Äì putting many beyond the reach of consumers. The arrival of container ships would eventually reduce those costs to less than one per cent.

&gt;The containers also had a knock-on effect on British manufacturing. When the new system started it greatly reduced shipping costs and our shops came within the reach of goods from the Far East. When the first container ship arrived here, almost half the country‚Äôs workforce was involved in manufacturing. Now it is fewer than 15 per cent. ¬≠Containers are so efficient and ¬≠inexpensive to use that amazingly it costs less to ship, say, a plasma television from the Far East than it does to deliver it by road from the store to your house.

[British cars were fucking awful.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9ztUlve9jc) As soon as we had access to far better foreign cars which could be imported at a fraction of the usual cost because of containerisation, why would we continue to buy inferior British made cars? Government wasn't going to save the industry because government mismanagement nearly killed off the [British aircraft industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNxu60pgD_E). Britain was the slowest growing developed nation post-WW2 due to extreme government mismanagement and the stranglehold that unions had over almost every part of the economy. Thatcher was inevitable because the public had grown extremely tired of everything that happened in the 70s and the unions destroyed public support for them.",,/r/europe/comments/gda98w/on_this_day_in_1979_margaret_thatcher_becomes_the/fpio5rv/,Zakman--,1588645019

OLD TURKIC KINSHIP TERMS IN EARLY MIDDLE CHINESE by Alexander VOVIN*

[The Origin of the Turks

](https://www.jstor.org/stable/547136?seq=1) published in Oxford and cited few dozens times, 

Turks didn't write their history themselves, Chinese wrote about them, reason is that they are nomadic people.

If you don't know relation about being nomadic and not writing about your own history, I am sorry for you.

All legimated sources show that Turks existed since bc2000

3045,"Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu is pretty dumb and disliked within his own party tbh. But he is in no way a nationalist. I know what you refer to. But in reality that was just him trying to get back at Erdogan who started to act like a nationalist. And the event he referred to as ""occupation"" of the islands by Greeks was in fact about Greece stationing troops and heavy equipment on demilitarized islands. The wording he used was borderline populist-nationalist. If you ask me he was trying to mimic Erdogan's populism (since it was pretty successful) before the election to get some votes. He failed though. And he didn't really do something like that again. If that's the only thing you know about him then you are right to see him as a nationalist, but he's pratcically the one who turned Chp from kemalist to something like a social democrat. He even calls Tunceli province by it's old name, Dersim. Something most nationalistic Turks hate. He's just utterly incompetent though. So i don't see him having a bright future in politics. 

Ekrem seems nice, he's infinitely better than Erdogan but he gives me the generic politician vibe. He plays both ways. He agreed to fund the dronemaker company Bayraktar's foundation, but he also visits jailed Hdp members and stuff. 

The one i like the most is Mansur Yavas the guy is a professional and a true statesman, although he was a member of the nationalist party in the past, he joined the CHP years ago and didn't have any major contraversies. Last year he humiliated the old Mayor of Ankara in the municipal elections. Since i hated the old mayor of Ankara almost as much as i hate Erdogan, i was supper happy that Mansur won. And after that he has been managing the city perfectly, got everybody's support conservatives, leftists, Turks and Kurds alike. And most importantly he exposed the old mayors corruptions again and again. And he's been pretty transparent about everything he does. He streams every auction online, constantly shares the recent data about the financial situation of the municipality etc. He's pretty good at his job and already improved the city significantly. At this rate his popularity will surpass Ekrem. He might be the next candidate.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/gd9x6k/turkey_polls_support_for_erdogan_and_the_ruling/fpi84z7/,ZrvaDetector,1588635576

But they didn't...which is my point. **You are trying to get yourself out of the hole you dug using semantics**

&gt;&gt;Did the original person supply it? Did anyone supply it? No one did.

&gt;I don't see how that's my problem.

I demonstrated in the summary of the conversation. You didn't ask for a quote from them even though it was HIGHLY  upvoted -- but  yet you become critical of anyone that made a claim that was opposite of that highly upvoted post



&gt;&gt;So why would people upvote a claim backed by nothing and then attack anyone that counters with the best indicator we have available?

&gt;My guess would be - because they agree with that claim and because ""best indicator we have available"" isn't good. But it could be pettier than that.


They agree with the claim...with no sources to support it. So isn't it likely that if they can't produce one bit of evidence, they are just irrationally hating on the US?


But let's go back to your original quote:

- ""If US is highly corrupt, then saying it is true. Saying something that is true is not stupid, whether you add sources or not.""

""IF"".  Now, they didn't produce any sources even when pressed on it. I googled it and found nothing credible to support the US is 'highly  corrupt"". 


1. Did they produce any sources? (no) 
2. Does a google search find any credible support to ""US is highly corrupt""? (No) 
3. So then how can you claim their statement is true and thus a source wasn't needed if there are no sourced to support it? 
4. If you now claim that you aren't taking a position IF it is true, then I have just pointed out to you that they were not able to provide a source. So then you would agree that they are NOT basing the statement ""US is highly corrupt"" on any credible sources but rather just opinion.

3207,"that is such a simplistic and broad definition that every non-democratic regime would be classified as fascism, therefore rendering the word useless.    

Fascism does not exist outside of the context of Class Warfare where it presents itself as a Third Way able to unify the Bourgeoisie and Proletariat under a single goal of building a New Man.   
To reach that goal a violent paramilitary militia associated with the Fascist Party is established this has multiple objectives :   
-fights communist organizations and Unions to present itself as a shield to the Bourgeoisie   
-Erode the authority and legitimacy of the Bourgeois Democracy making it so unstable that in the end only the Fascist Party is able to restore and maintain order.    

Once that objective is complete the Party is granted or takes power and since it has eroded all democratic legitimacy it is able to bring violence as a tool of power into the citizen's everyday life. This is used both to destroy the remaining opposition and to silence any future possible competitive organization.    
Once opposition is destroyed the State and Party begin to fuse, One mandatory Party Union is created, mandatory Party youth organizations, mandatory Leisure groups, etc... like a parasite the party infects and attaches itself to every aspect of the citizen's life.    

THIS is what makes Fascism unique, if you ever lived in a dictatorship you must have realized how different this is. In normal dictatorships the powers that be do not want the citizens to care about politics, the less they care the better as the people are seen as too unknowledgeable to provide any useful imput. On the contrary in Fascism the Party-State apparatus WANTS the citizen to care, they WANT them to believe in the Fascist ideals.   
Finally the party destroys the last possible opposition by destroying private property and establishing a corporatist state where private companies are entirely under the orders of the State and where business owners can be replaced without a second thought if they disobey or disagree with the Party-State line.   

The Party is now the only authority that exists, it has destroyed the army, it has destroyed the State, it has destroyed any organized competition and economic actors that could put itself between the Party and the Citizen.   

By destroying the meaning of the word ""Fascist"" you make the word lose all meaning and by doing so you allow ACTUAL fascists to hide among more conventional groups and deflect any accusation by retorting that you accuse anyone of being a fascist and the people themselves will ignore your warning as the word doesn't mean anything anymore.

Bloated and ineffective state organs were trimmed down in favor of a leaner and more efficient government. 

Because she could have done all that and spent money on reviving those northern communities affected by the closures, instead we got things such as proposals to allow places like Liverpool to wither and die.

3440,"&gt; How did that competitive environment serve British manufacturing?

It didn't. British manufacturing died because it couldn't compete with the high value manufacturing of Germany or Japan/Korea nor the cheap, unlimited labor of China. The competitive environment opened doors to other avenues such as a heavier emphasis on services like finance, commerce and trading. 

&gt; The UK had decent growth, on par with France and Germany both prior and during her tenure. Both UK recessions in the 70s were caused by the oil crises. Beyond these, all three countries experienced similar growth trends. Yet only the Anglosphere fully embraced Reaganomics.

The oil crises didn't help anybody's economy but the UK was dealt an additional whammy by the unions' incessant striking. The strikes paralyzed their economy when it was already weak and brought the UK to its knees. If the unions couldn't strike deals with the socialist leaning Labour governments of the 1970s, who could they strike a deal with? 

Thatcher did the right thing by bringing the unions to heel. France is facing the same thing Britain did by unions taking the country hostage and paralyzing key infrastructure and services like trains. 

&gt; Thatcher's policy agenda was not solely about coal miners and with the benefit of hindsight it was not even among those with longer lasting effects, unless we're talking about the British labor market and union power.

Union power and reducing it was definitely a keystone of her policy. The bigger picture was that the British population didn't have the skillset or drive to be globally competitive. This uncompetitive workforce was protected in their positions by way of powerful unions, leading to a vicious cycle. 

&gt; What transpired in this era was the growth of the financial services sector at the expense of others, cementing a weird cousin of the Dutch disease.

Getting into financial and other service based industries was more sustainable than the sluggish and uncompetitive manufacturing or extraction that they were doing prior to Thatcher. Again, the coal miners and other factory workers were crying about having lost their jobs but it was an industry in decline and no amount of union power could have saved them as the trend was going in the opposite direction.",ASEAN,/r/europe/comments/gda98w/on_this_day_in_1979_margaret_thatcher_becomes_the/fpgnccb/,throwaway_firstie,1588606016

3466,"&gt; Sadly the cult of personality that surrounds Kemalisms is deeply rooted in Turkey making it impossible to criticize all the terrible aspects of it that hide behind the ""rally around the flag"" policy of Kemalism.

Forget criticizing him. You can't even discuss that his ethnicity is something else other than a full blooded Turk, they'll immediately be offended and report you to the nearest authority they know.  
   
I have no need to criticize him at all. I was debating with a knuckle-head for a while about the ethnic diversity in Anatolia when the first Turko-Persian Seljuks arrived and he was claiming Greeks and Kurds never lived in Anatolia before Turks. I won't get into the long debate but it was centered about genetic studies which showed much little central Asian contribution to the genetic make up of modern Turks today (like mostly under 20-25%) and more contribution by Eastern Meditterannean/Caucasian/Middle Eastern to show the ethnic diversity in today's Turkey and he kept rejecting all evidence with funny excuses, and his point was dna samples should be taken from Turkmens only since Turkmens were the Turks in Ottoman and Seljuk era.   
   
At some point in the discussion, I pointed that immigrants and Kurds made up a majority in Turkey and people were mostly mixed ethnicity so you can't just take samples from Turkmens just because you want to prove your point.  Anyway, at one point I pointed that even Ataturk wasn't a Turkic Turk as he was a blue eyed blonde guy from Salonica with Jewish roots since he went to a Jewish school for (donme) Jews founded by Semsi Efendi and showed an article from ""Shalom newspaper"" in Turkey ( [a newspaper by subscription for the Jewish community in Turkey](http://www.salom.com.tr/arsiv/haber-86207-selanik_ve_yahudi_kulturunden_kalamayanlar__1.html) ) which discusses his teacher Semsi Efendi and his place in the history of (donme) Jewish community in Salonica, and I also indicated his second right hand man Ismet Inonu was also Kurdish and was trying to show the ethnic diversity. I wasn't insulting either man, I was pointing out others who built the industries in Turkey after the founding of the republic being mostly immigrants (Caucasians, Balkanians, etc) or descendants of converts or Kurds to show the ethnic diversity in Anatolia and not just Turkmens.
  
He got me banned from their sub for ""insulting the founder of the country"" and the moderator of the sub told me to move to Saudi Arabia for insulting Ataturk.   
   
For these people, Ataturk not being a Turk and the possibility of him having Jewish roots is an insult.  
  
And most people would report others to the government if they see someone even questioning Ataturk online. (Same applies to Erdogan fans, they also report people for ""offending them"" by ""insulting their president"".) Most Turks are like that.   
  
Aside from that, nationalism in Turkey usually borders racism. Calling someone ""Armenian"" or ""Jew"" or ""Greek semen"" is used like an insult in Turkey. 2 years ago when the Turkish government released family records of people in Turkey, some people found out that they weren't actually full blooded Turks, some found out they had Armenian ancestry and that didn't sit well with some people.",,/r/europe/comments/gd9x6k/turkey_polls_support_for_erdogan_and_the_ruling/fpgnxv6/,urbanjihad,1588606335

3572,"&gt; The future of our world should be green replenishable energies. 

Yes, and natural gas is right now the best method we have to make sure our demand it met while the transition to renewable energy is undergoing.

Germany decided to shut down our NPPs (bad idea from my perspective, but that's just how it is) this meant we have very limited alternatives to supply the demand if the renewables had a bad day.

Coal is multiple times worse, oil is also worse (but not as bad), water power cannot take up the slack (not enough capacity) batteries are too expensive for longer term storage.

Natural gas plants are cheap, they can run on demand, we have storage capacities for about half a year in Germany, it is the least CO2 intensive fossil fuel.

This leads us to the supplier. Especially when we say that it's only a medium term source of energy until we are fully renewable we cannot develop all possible delivery chains. (as the money that would take is better spent on more wind farms etc)

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_natural\_gas\_proven\_reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_natural_gas_proven_reserves) 

\#1 Russia is the one you try to evade.

\#2 Iran is pretty much dead while the US sanctions trade with them

\#3 Qatar is too far away to supply us with LNG.

With these 3 you've already excluded over 50% of the worldwide known reserves.

\#4 US, same a Qatar, not enough LNG tankers. 

So if we wanna go with natural gas, Russia is unavoidable. Yes this doesn't increase energy security by much, but in the relationship of Germany and Russia, Russia has more to lose. And with NS1+2 it has no excuse anymore that some other nation is the problem. 

This means that if this sources has a man-made problem of any sort, Russia will be blamed and we'll instantly make the money available to tap other sources. That money won't be available for renewable energy anymore (unless we go nuclear again) but we can make it happen.

So what do you want to happen earlier?: Europe going green and energy independent or Russia getting removed as a energy supplier.

Some are pretty harsh and on opposite sides of spectrum. That‚Äôs just how freedom of speech works. That gives us platform for discussion. In regards to Polish-Ukrainian history, there is plethora of issues. It would take ages to solve. But; difference with a lot of pro-Russian journalists is that they despite being aware or not are feeding pretty actionable propaganda. I can enjoy a discussion on what is a proper response in peaceful times; but when there‚Äôs ongoing hot conflict (and people die on pretty much daily basis in the east of Ukraine) I think any reasonable person would agree this must be stopped. And it is by enforcing some laws. Now when people end up in jail that‚Äôs for breaking a law, right? So yeah, matter of discussion here are what those laws are trying to achieve. In Ukrainian case they are targeting existence and sovereignty  of state. Other examples‚Ä¶ take Russia and Turkey. They are fighting for existence of regime rather than state. It is obvious if you look at succession of power in these countries. As much as I may be pro or opposite to new Ukrainian President, executive branch or parliament, I‚Äôm happy to say they were elected in transparent way using democratic procedures. I can‚Äôt say that about Russia and Turkey. And I personally think that Poland is strong democracy too.

Political systems are a lot more complicated than face value and have a lot of written and unwritten rules. Political culture is very important in a country.

Overall, in the EU, public expenditure on fire-protection services remained stable at around 0.4 ‚Äì 0.5% of total expenditure since the beginning of the time series in 2001.

In 2018, the ratio of government fire-protection expenditure to total expenditure varied across EU Member States from 0.1% of total expenditure in Denmark, 0.2% in Malta and 0.3% in Ireland, Austria, Portugal and Slovenia, to 0.7% in Czechia and Lithuania, 0.8% in Romania and 0.9% in Bulgaria.

No shit, maybe you people are brainwashed and we‚Äôre not. How about that? I am so tired of hearing and reading the same copy paste stuff about my country. 

You people are so sink in your hubris that you claim 80 millions of people (or half) are brainwashed and in general you‚Äôre better, more sane, more conscious than all of them. I don‚Äôt want to take it into there, but I am pretty sure (if you are European) you‚Äôre a white central European, right? 

Admit it, your brains start to work with an acceptance that even you know more things about Turkey than most of the Turks, and you somehow believe, Erdogan cracks down journalists and millions of Turks are not caring it, as they are brainwashed. 

But here is a cold truth for you, try to understand and swallow.

- I am almost 30 years old. I know before Erdogan times. 
- I have never voted Erdogan.
- I am not watching TV and not following any state media since maybe 10 years or so.

That's up to each and every one of Northern Ireland's people. Northern Ireland as a populace, don't have the same binary, mutually exclusive identity problem that England has. So the majority statistic you cite actually means British _or_ both!

Finally, Northern Ireland voted 56% to Remain. Again, Northern Ireland can choose what it wants to do. It's entitled to a referendum on Irish unification and with Sinn Fein now the second biggest party in Ireland's Parliament and coalition talks still progressing, it's clear there is an appetite to maintain that self determination and answer the question once and for all.",,/r/europe/comments/gcvq1b/gdp_growth_in_2020_as_projected_by_the_imf/fpewnpz/,BizSavvyTechie,1588556561

4146,"&gt;	Nope, I just hope you develop some critical thinking.

I had plenty before, though a few brain cells have died reading your sorry excuse for a lesson.

&gt;	In my scenario, the police can‚Äôt act because it doesn‚Äôt have the funds, which have provably been reduced. In your scenario, the police doesn‚Äôt act because they are afraid. Does that seem reasonable to you? Does that seem like something that is even remotely fathomable in a country like the UK? Because if so, you might have a case of the right-wingies.

And your *scenario*, as you describe it, has so far no basis in any of the statements we have seen from whistleblowers. The common theme cited is avoiding racial tension, not an inability to get resources to stop it. You haven‚Äôt actually suggested why your ‚Äòscenario‚Äô has more credit than the statements available to the public, nor why it is outlandish for the UK to be worried about racial tension with Muslims in a post 9/11 ISIL landscape. You haven‚Äôt even explained why being worried about racial tension makes someone ‚Äòright wingies‚Äô.

What will you do when critical thinking doesn‚Äôt work in your favor, I wonder?

&gt;	Right-wingies is more and more likely, you might want to check with a doctor. Also, *its (second time you make this mistake).

Oh so that‚Äôs what you will do. How kind of you to blame others for your own inability to argue! I suppose this is your version of ‚Äòsharing the wealth‚Äô, right?

&gt;	Not explicitely, Labour asked for more police funding across the board.

The Labour **Party** wanted **more overall budget**. This was something I never questioned.

What I did question was **your** assertion that the **Rotherham Labour Council** specifically requested resources to take down the child pedo ring they probably knew about and **that specific request specifically rejected by the government.**

Why does your scenario not show up in any of the reports? Why do you keep asking me to believe your ideas instead of sourced information, then moaning that my disbelief is due to a lack of critical thought?

&gt;	Yes, ‚ÄúTheresa May insisted the UK‚Äôs largest police force was ‚Äúwell-resourced‚Äù.‚Äù

You do realize that the Rotherham fiasco was documented as occurring **since the 1980‚Äôs** right? This goes back further than May, Cameron, Brown, Blair and Major !

Do you even know what the hell is going on, or are you just spitting out whatever jumps to your head first?

&gt;	they are proven to have known about
Oh really? Got a source on that? And I guess Labour knew but the Conservatives didn‚Äôt?

For fuck sake, **the Rotherham Whistleblowers explicitly leaked reports that the council and local police knew about the sex gangs but did nothing and kept it hush to avoid racial backlash**. It‚Äôs the basic point of the mess !

This brings the timeframe some way back) and hand in hand, they have worked years and years to systematically put their own people (which was 95% overlapping in its heyday I would say) in positions of power (mainly favoring Gulenists but again, same difference from my perspective as they both would have absolutely no quarrels with my ""marginal"" friends being publicly lynched in like, 2008ish), squeezing out ""moderate"" or secular people at any given chance and generally boosting each other up to devour a larger piece of the pie, together. How do you think AKP has amassed such a stronghold on a nation of 60+ million people with not insignificant European leaning values (on average much more so than today I would say)? It was the ""political Islamist"" power that they consolidated together.

As someone who hates them both and is practically surrounded by ex-Hizmet guys I feel like it is important to realize that if Gulen had ""won"" the power struggle they had, things would still be fucked for us. But I emphasize with your point in that the Gulenists I have talked with who have lived abroad have been more tolerant than Turkish Gulenists, which were indistinguishable from the Erdogan supporters before 2010s.

So  the Cree Nation started their long treck east to the promised land of Sipiwininiwak, where this prophecy will come to pass. On their way on the windy shores of Hudson bay they discovered a cave where a legend of the Renaissance had been left by our forefathers. The treck lasted 17 years and after that the cree started to fufill their profecy. Sadly the grain in Sipiwininiwak less than optimal so the Cree Nation will remigrate to it and hope to discover some furry beast to slay.

Do I need to connect the dots for you mr progressive? Vilifying people leads to hate, hate leads to violence. Pogrom kielecki, aforementioned holocaust, Srebrenica, armenian genocide and so on didn't appear form thin air, same goes with violence against darker skinned people or LGBT in Poland. This vilification comes among others from the state TV, the de facto leader of Poland and as every oppositionist other that mr progressive knows it was the main point of PiS campaign.


&gt;denying antiLGBT politics has an impact on sanity of LGBT people

""76% of LGBTQ youth felt that the recent political climate impacted their mental health or sense of self"". What else will you deny mr progressive? The church having a lot of power in Poland? The moon landing? Roundness of earth?

Lastly please stop pretending you're progressive. You're an enabler of violence with your brilliant ""I'll bury my head in the sand when I see discrimination"" approach. Also by denying the obvious link between vilification and violence, depression, suicides that is at the foundation of hate speech laws that exist in every civilised european country puts you in the same row as right wing nuts like Korwin-Mikke.",,/r/europe/comments/gcp1j8/happy_constitution_day_from_lithuania_poland/fpe6ll4/,Bonus-BGC,1588541384

Or would you say that ambassador don‚Äôt do official visits?

What if ambassador sent a love letter? 

&gt; The letter was sent from the ambassador of the Russian Federation to the president of the foreign affairs committee of the Italian Senate. 

The letter was sent from the leader of Russian foreign affairs committee to His Italian colleague. 

&gt;In the letter he wrote to forward the letter to all members of the Italian Senate. The ambassador thanks the president of the committee in advance for all the work he will do to help lift the sanctions. 

Here‚Äôs the actual translation of Razov‚Äôs cover letter

Dear President, Dear Vito Rosario, I have the honor to send attached the appeal (accompanied by the unofficial translation into Italian) of the President of the foundation  international public ""Russian Peace Foundation"", President of the Committee for International Affairs of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Leonid Slutskii concerning the need to remove unilateral sanctions imposed under the conditions of the global epidemiological threat by circumventing the mechanism of the Security Council of the  UN.  Please kindly wish to bring the contents of this document to the attention of the Italian senators.  Thanking you in advance for all that you want to do in this regard, I take this opportunity to express to you, Dear President, the deeds of my highest consideration.  An embrace Sergey RAZOV SEN.  VITO ROSARIO PETROCELLI, CHAIRMAN OF THE III COMMISSION FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, EMIGRATION OF THE SENATE OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC Rome

&gt;This looks to me as a request by (a representative of) the Russian Federation to Italian politician to lift the sanctions.

Nah, your translation is wrong and you are putting loaded words that don‚Äôt belong to the actual letters to support your claim and mislead people. 

&gt; This letter was sent to Italy after Russian has sent aid to Italy. 

Almost a month later, but whatever. Slutskiy sent the same letter to the osce and eu assault in March, there was a vote on Slutskiy initiative in the UN to unilaterally lift sanctionS on all countries in late February if I recall correctly.

&gt;Also downplaying LGBT free zones because they don't explicitly talk about persecuting gay people

Nope, downplaying them because they are noting more than powerless symbolical law. Its like making Jesus king of Poland or w/e. Simply ignore them because this kind of law does nothing. 

Talking about them, criticizing them and go on only gives them response that they need. This only gives supporters of this zones satisfaction, and proves them that this law has impact because people speak about it. ""WE DID IT, LGBT MAD, WE NEED MORE OF THIS"". Downplaying it gonna make it irrelevant, people gonna forget about it, and guess what? It will lose even this ""symbolical"" power. Sometimes you cant discuss with someone, best response is to ignore them, just to show them that their actions do not matter and their symbolism is meaningless.

- Police violence:

-2 policemen were filmed shouting a racist slur and laughing at the idea of him drowning and drowning him. (In 1961, hundreds of Algerians were drowned in the Seine).

One of the two policemen, a commissioner, had already been been condemned (to a one-year suspended sentence) for violence against a man in 2004: he had been stripped naked, with a wheel cover put in in ass... [Article](http://www.leparisien.fr/seine-saint-denis-93/l-ile-saint-denis-l-igpn-saisie-apres-des-propos-racistes-tenus-par-des-policiers-lors-d-une-interpellation-26-04-2020-8306253.php) in French, with video). 

-The European Court of Human Rights condemned France for a case dating back to 2002, about a man who had been violently arrested. [Article](http://plan-paix-onu.blogspot.com/2020/04/la-france-condamnee-par-la-cour.html), in French.


-A 13 year-old was hit by the police near Orl√©ans: broken rib. [Article](http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/loiret-enquete-ouverte-apres-l-interpellation-musclee-d-un-adolescent-29-04-2020-8308362.php), in French.


-Anti-Macron banners result in police visits and detention in several cities. [Article](https://www.liberation.fr/france/2020/05/01/a-toulouse-montpellier-ou-paris-la-police-debarque-pour-des-banderoles-anti-macron_1786871), in French and behind paywall.

-On MayDay this past friday, protests were banned because of the lockdown, hundreds of policemen prevented people to gather and a few people were arrested... but Marine le Pen was free to hold her annual ceremony in hommage to Joan of Arc (or rather, re-celebrate it: she had stopped doing so a few years ago, because she didnt want to be visibly associated to her father, but this year he didn't visit the statue).

-A group of anti-nuclear activists were massively surveilled by the French justice. Dozens of people listened to, the equivalent of 16 years of tapes, etc. These investigation have already cost more than 1 million euros. [Article](https://reporterre.net/1-3-La-justice-a-massivement-surveille-les-militants-antinucleaires-de-Bure), in French.

- The PM announced more concrete details about the end of the lockdown, from May 11th.

Macron gave a speech and announced the lockdown would stop on that day, May 11th, but he had only told his PM and other ministers 15 minutes in advance. They had a few days to think about how to make it happen. Edouard Philippe, our PM, gave some details in front of parliament this week.

A map will dictate which departments can ease the lockdown or not (based on number of covid cases plus number of beds occupied in the hospitals of that region). The differences between the green and the red departments aren't very clear to me, since you can travel in a 100 km radius anyway.. it looks like the main thing that changes is that schools and parks would not reopen.

Schools are going to reopen. Starting with the youngest children. Maximum 15 kids per class (so class one week- home the next and so on? Mayors have to decide and implement it), you have to bring your cold lunch (we do'nt to taht in France). Toddlers won't be required to wear masks, but are apparently expected to somehow respect social distancing rules, stay at their individual tables, not play with all the toys or form groups. For the older ones (6-10 year-olds) same rules, which they may actually be able to follow, plus they can wear masks. Older ones (11-15 years old) will go back to school a bit later. But all this is voluntary: parents have to decide. Rich ones can decide, the poorer however can't really afford to do so since they'll have to prove the school doesn't open. The scientific council Macron consults during this pandemic stated they were unfavorable to schools reopening now. But the Health minister just [lied about it](http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/olivier-veran-la-date-de-lever-du-confinement-pourrait-etre-remise-en-question-02-05-2020-8309694.php) (as they do, all time). 

- Tracking app or no tracking app?

The government was planning on tracking people with an app, but it's not ready yet. And it's been widely criticized, even by LREM MPs. (LREM= Macron's party). For that reason they had planned on making MPs vote for the end of lockdown measures and the implementation of said app at the same time (that way LREM MPs who intended to vote against the app couldn't do so.) But they changed their mind at the last minute and apparently the app idea is postponed. BUT they are still planning on ""tracking"" people and it's now not clear how, the details of the future legislation to make sure covid patients don't infect people are only beginning to emerge in the press. 

- It looks like supermarket chains have been able to purchase and stock millions of masks, while health professional were scrambing to find some.

I personally still haven't found/bought any mask... will probably buy one in a supermarket this week since they are finally being sold en masse. Until then health professionals were priority receivers, in pharmacies. Pharmacies have just been told they can sell (fabric) masks to people but supermarkets are ready before them: they have been able to purchase 65 millions... while the state and the regions were failing to do the same.

We will see whether we have enough for everyone. They cost about 5 euros, so poor families won't be able to afford it.

- Macron spoke on May Day, saying that polical voices = bickering.

Last year on May Day, protesters were charged by the police and took refuge in the nearest building, which happened to be a hospital, more precisely a reanimation wing. The Interior minister and the media lied about it, accusing them of being violent thugs who wanted to target doctors and patients (?)

The year before, Macron's bodyguard, Alexandre Benalla punched and hit protesters. 

- The government created a list of approved press articles.

Allegedly to combat fake news about covid-19. In France politicians and pundits are bsolutely obsessed with fake news and fact-cheching social media.

- Macron called a far-right pundit after a video emerged on social media of him being followed and insluted by a man.

4667,"Somewhat misleading headline.  
  
Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Program, is praising the Swedish situation and model, but it's specifically about the cooperation between population and government, and the self-regulation of the people:  
  
&gt; There are ‚Äúlessons to be learned‚Äù from Sweden, which is relying on the self-discipline of its citizens to defeat the pandemic, contended Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Program, which is responsible for the international containment and treatment of COVID-19.  
  
&gt; ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a perception out that Sweden has not put in control measures and just has allowed the disease to spread,‚Äù noted Dr. Ryan. ‚ÄúNothing can be further from the truth.‚Äù  
  
---  
  
&gt; He said what Sweden has done differently is to rely heavily on its relationship with its citizenry and the ability and willingness of Swedes to implement self-distancing and self-regulate.  
  
&gt; ‚ÄúIn that sense, they have implemented public policy through that partnership with the population,‚Äù according to Dr. Ryan.  
  
This is possible here in Sweden because we generally have such high trust in our authorities, and because people here actually follow the recommendations (understanding that ""recommendation"" here means ""do as recommended or be *forced* to do it""), meaning stricter regulation is not needed as much as in some other nations.  
  
Also, this is *still* misinformation that keeps being spread;  
  
&gt; Sweden's experiment seeking to confer ""herd immunity"" against COVID-19 on its population -- and not relying heavily on movement restrictions and strict social distancing -- isn't going well for its senior citizens.  
  
The Swedish strategy is *not* centered on achieveing herd immunity, any more than in any other country. It has never been. Just like everyone else, we base our strategy on the idea of slowing the spread, we just do it in a slightly different way. Still, this claim keeps being circulated by pretty much all media and people online. I believe it is based on two things:  
  
1) Quoting Tegnell (dude leading our coronavirus response) out of context. He said that the *end goal* of all countries must be to reach herd immunity, through vaccines or natural means, but that the Swedish strategy is *not* to intentionally allow quick spread and achieve it faster.  
  
2) A small group of researchers/experts not involved in the coronavirus response said that they *believe* the Swedish strategy is to allow spread to reach herd immunity quickly. As I said though, Tegnell and our health minister have denied this is the case.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/gcr05i/coronavirus_update_who_praises_sweden_for/fpd53wb/,fredagsfisk,1588520022

4983,"I know this subreddit attacks American style skyscrappers that're 'safe' in design rather than trying to be ultra edgy but the skyline of Paris remains relevant and modern (referring to its highrise/skyscrapper cluster) because it's not trying to be Dubai or some edgy Asian city.. same with the Arch that's very safe in style.. it looks better today than China's 'pants' building (attempt at an arch that failed) and will continue to look relevant in the future while those super edgy buildings that look amazing today will age more an more, some being epic eyesores in 30 years. 

I would like to see France at least try to have *some* edgy buildings because it truly does look like a very standard US/Canadian city outside of the arch. NYC is leading the world with ultra skinny/tall buildings. Until you see them in person, you dont get how neat they are and how tiny of a footprint they are on the city itself.. I could see a Parisian twist going along with the 'safe squareness' from NA mixed to make an incredible skyscrapper. Just dont expect to ever live in one.. if you want an entire floor to yourself, expect to pay 10's of millions of euros.

Has anyone else looked at the [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/EllaHillUK) in question? Might be worth doing so before drawing any serious conclusions from this. It tweets a lot about anti-white racism that isn't linked to the ""grooming gang"" debate, and things like ""Muslim supremacy"" and ""the far left"". When the grooming debate does come up it makes a lot of references to the victim's whiteness, and frequently tweets the [same Venn diagram about ""anti-western hate crime""](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EW1piV-WkAEUQT6?format=jpg&amp;name=large).

5418,"&amp;#x200B;

it is exactly places like trains where masks are useless. You need respirators (correctly used ) and there are not enough of them (nursing installations are not saturated even now, and most of the supplies are not up to the task. What I've seen myself are the Chinese knock offs mostly). Masks don't block, they reduce chance of transmission and while this chance reduction is significant per ""round"" the total chance accumulates in real life way too quick..

 if you talk to somebody or have somebody sneezing in your face, you will accumulate quickly enough material to get ill with mask or without.

I remind that the personnel in the hospitals still get ill even with the right equipment.

Some of them still die.

There was extensive research in the 90s and 00s where they have studied practical use of surgical masks in the hospitals dealing with respiratory deceases. The practicalities are quite different from ""theoretical constructs"" which are regularly proposed (like  every 10 years still).

""False safety"" mantra comes from practical experience. If the doctors can not manage, one has to be an idiot to expect anything better from the general populace.

 

Washing hands and removal of the snack joints next to the stations would be a sufficient start. Vehicle basic hygiene between transport cycles is even better. Asking passengers to skip usual courtesy rules and to avoid talking to the strangers would be even better. We can return back to normality in a year.

&amp;#x200B;

Reiterating somehow lost reason for 1.5 m: talking dutch propel droplets up to 1.5m, talking English because of the abundance of ""closed"" syllables up to 2m(hence 6feet). Other languages can have other limits.

This distance is important when you talk. Standing, walking etc. next to each other will produce nothing special. There is no f-ng ""cloud"" of particles which can contain this virus. The droplets fly straight and then drop: on the ground, tables, cloth etc. The things which you can later toutch and bring this crap straight into your mouth.

It's mind boggling to read some crap published even in ""respectful"" news outlets about ""research"".

 The point is that breathing produces nothing special. The virus is not airborne.

 There are no indications of the contrary, indeed there are plenty of the examples accumulated during identify&amp;trace period which show the contagion happens mostly through ""dirty hands"" even in the cases of very ill individual. 

Direct contagion through droplets happens mostly in the families/close friends circles and in the hospitals and leads much more often to the serious cases.

They have to enforce rule of  ""no harm to other people"" which exists already and was used for example with HIV cases.

 i.e. they have to publish the list of the symptoms which require people to stay at home. ""Asymptomatic"" people can transmit by ""dirty hands"" only, so while their existence is important (i.e. no chance for the virus eradication), their presence makes no principal difference. You still have to wash hands before eating, or even better  before (and after of course) WC. Try not to eat outside and snacking.

To those who have to use respirators:

**Wash your f-ng face and neck in the end of shift.**

hands is not the only body part which is exposed.

P.S. There will be no mask requirements in the Netherlands, pressure from Germany or not.",,/r/europe/comments/gc8zv3/face_mask_policies_in_europe_as_of_1_may_2020_oc/fpb5ktk/,dondarreb,1588462580

5618,"&gt;we are just as undemocratic as them.

And I'm just as willing to call frances actions in Algeria undemocratic or even as controversial as it is Ukraine's as I am about Spain's in Catalonia.

The difference is with most these countries wouldn't enforce them similiar to how countries have blasphemy laws that they dont enforce.

&gt;And I agree with the principle that Catalonia is part of Spain, it doesn't make me ""undemocratic"" 

No but the Spanish constitution failing to allow them to vote on weather they believe this to be the case is.

&gt;, because you asume that Catalonia on its own has its own right to decide but based on what exactly

The same reason why only Spanish people vote in spanish elections. Because it isnt for people outside of a region to decide what people within a region want unless that region wants them to decide for them wich clearly isnt the case with Catalonia. The reason it's only the community of catalonia is because it's only the community of Catalonia that want independence.

&gt;I also consider the Catalan culture and language to be part of my country

Ok and what abput the Russians who think the same about all Ukrainians does this justify them in conquering all of Ukraine.

&gt; who are you to decide it's not and that it should be segregated in a different country?

Not me or you who decides it's the catalans who decide.

&gt;OK, let's have it... after we change the constitution, democratically. 

Do you not see the problem wih that it isnt Catalonia or the Basque country that's deciding there destiny it's the rest of spain that isnt fair that's  imperialism. 

&gt;But we have to agree to change things, when not even half the Catalan population wants to be independent!!

No only Catalonia should have to agree same as only Scotland,  and only Quebec had to decide.

Regulations prevent bottom-up innovation and maintain the status quo. This is what Max Weber called ""the iron cage of rationalization"" and it is present in all industrialized nations, but it is most visible in the US. This results in highly rationalized communities without spirit or soul, and people becoming disenchanted with the community, which they stop participating in. This means they don't vote in local elections and communities fall apart even more, perpetuating a vicious cycle. 

Sprawl is the biggest problem in American society. Period. And, incredibly, no Americans know about it. Like fish in poisoned water. It has resulted in environmental, racial, social, health and identity crises.

Well let me tell you that the Autonomous Community of Catalonia exists because there was an agreement when Spain recovered the democracy after Franco's death (together with Galicia and Basque Country). Just a bit later on this system was applied all over the country for the rest of regions, with their own cultures and languages too... like Asturias for example.

Spain has a great advantage with solar energy. The Spanish region of Andalucia is the place in Europe with more sunshine hours with 2.800 hours (320 days a year). Andalusia is the first region of Spain in solar utilization in all technologies and world leader in the development of solar thermal energy. In 2019, more photovoltaic panels have been installed in Andalusia than in the last twenty years. The reduction of costs have made photovoltaic energy profitable in Andalusia and it can be produced at competitive prices without public subsidies. At the moment, 13,000 megawatts are being developed in Andalusia which would fill the entire capacity of the Spanish Electricity Network in the region to evacuate this energy. The limit to growth is in the capacity of the electrical infrastructures to receive and distribute this new production.

If any of those tests is positive they are still considered inflected and tested again after 7 days. Easy to see how it can cause a huge delay in reporting people as recovered.

Alot of my views are left-leaning but I am very much opposed to any authoritarian restrictions on speech or discourse. Me, telling you that this story is not about black and white ""nazi's vs the righteous"" does not make me ""pro-fascist"".

&gt; You can say you won't pay taxes if you're no longer a citizen of your country and there are no other documents binding you to pay taxes for your house/business/car/whatever, otherwise your declaration is automatically void.

The declaration is legally meaningless in any case, because there is simply no law governing such declarations, just the tax code which says who's has to pay taxes, and who doesn't. 

&gt;Of course there are, otherwise there would have not been a dispute in the first place.

\*\*But that isn't the point I'm making\*\*, which is that he is uses language to suggest that this action is an indicator that he took problem as seriously as he should've. He did not.

We know that he \*didn't\* take it very seriously as he is on the record describing it as similar to the flu and downplayed the likelihood of case growth - a stance that he knows is now a liability since there are 50,000+ US citizens who lost heir lives.

He omits mentioning the fact that there was a distinct possibility that his ""closing of the border"" only minimised the virus travelling, and that he should've implemented (or at least suggested) more comprehensive measures such as 14 day self-isolation for incoming travelers (which other leaders deemed appropriate). None of that is mentioned, and it's important because without a leader taking that kind of personal responsibility for past mistakes there's minimal room to learn from those past mistakes.",,/r/europe/comments/gbdqwh/chinese_embassy_in_france_mocks_us_coronavirus/fp9h5zm/,spiteful-vengeance,1588426075
