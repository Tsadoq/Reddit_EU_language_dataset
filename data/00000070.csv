2,"Thanks, we have similar laws in most developed countries and honestly, I support these laws fully.

Squatters serve a very useful societal purpose: they prevent unoccupied housing.

In countries where squatters have no rights, landlords often keep houses empty in search of every higher rents. This leads to a bad societal outcome. Working class people can't afford high rents and live in decrepit houses while perfectly fine houses remain empty for years.

Squatters and squatter rights ensure that landlords can't leave houses empty for speculative purposes.

So for people like these pensioners.  If you are going to leave a villa unoccupied for six months per year, either find a renter to occupy it or pay for a house sitter or security (which creates a job) or sell the villa so somebody else can make better use of it.

This is just a waste of societal resources.",North Holland (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/ipaucd/french_pensioners_left_homeless_by_squatters_who/g4j8to0/,alvvayson,1599647873

86,"That's typical if you ask me. When universities are free (or almost free) and oversubscribed, they make academically challenging and bureaucratically complicated to finish with your qualification. This is especially true if the country, like Greece, is essentially using tertiary education as a way to reduce unemployment figures. Professors then try desperately to cull the herd to keep the number of students reasonable.

If university is free (or almost free) and not oversubscribed, then demand exceeds supply, meaning entry requirements are higher but once you're in there's no real pressure to fail students. However, schools think it's they're job to produce university eligible students and if they're producing many then that's doing their job well, so you get constant grade inflation as they're fighting over a finite number of places.

If university is expensive then supply will follow demand, so entry is not so hard, and high numbers of failing students look bad to prospective students, so it's not like they're culling the herd either, but then you get degree mills and the degree is only good as the university that issued it.",,/r/europe/comments/ipao4v/ownership_of_the_eu_merchant_fleet/g4j9fmf/,kingofeggsandwiches,1599648502

Though admittedly they're not alone in this.

Greece's biggest problem is that it doesn't have a robust industrial base. The economy is too reliant on tourism which is a shaky sector at the best of times. Many export items are fairly useless as they are low value added and require imports rather than drive the primary sector, like oil refining.

Unfortunately data predating the 90s is hard to come by but one explanation is that Greece failed to grow its industrial sector since the mid-90s because manufacturing was a much larger share of the economy back then, missing out on or messing up an important transition and failing to position itself in the EU economy.

141,"AstraZeneca has paused all clinical trials of the Covid-19 vaccine it is developing with Oxford university after a participant in the UK section of the study suffered a suspected serious adverse reaction. 

The UK-based drugmaker voluntarily put the trial on hold after the discovery of the sick participant. AstraZeneca said it was working to review the event to ensure it would not result in a significant delay to the study. 

Shares of the UK pharmaceutical company dropped just over 2 per cent in early trading in London on Wednesday. The group’s New-York listed shares fell in after-hours trading on Tuesday after trade publication [STAT](https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/08/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-study-put-on-hold-due-to-suspected-adverse-reaction-in-participant-in-the-u-k/) first reported that the trial had to be stopped. 

AstraZeneca had been on track to become one of the first drugmakers to deliver results from a large trial of a Covid-19 vaccine in a race where many pharmaceutical companies are moving at breakneck speed. The White House has [considered fast-tracking](https://www.ft.com/content/b053f55b-2a8b-436c-8154-0e93dcdb3c1a) the company’s inoculation ahead of the US presidential election, according to people familiar with the matter. 

“As part of the ongoing randomised, controlled global trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine, our standard review process triggered a pause to vaccination to allow review of safety data,” a spokesman said. 

“This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials,” he added. “In large trials, illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully.” 

It is not unusual for clinical trials to be paused. But in the most scrutinised vaccine development process ever, any sign of potentially negative side-effects could be seen as scuppering hopes for rapid relief from the pandemic. 

“The trial was expected to read out by November (as an upper estimate) and potentially in the next few weeks,” noted analysts at Shore Capital. “However, any suspension to the trial is likely to lead to delays in these timelines.”

Even if AstraZeneca’s vaccine is eventually approved, concerns about side-effects may still deter people from getting vaccinated.

Experts have raised concerns that approval of a vaccine could be rushed as the process becomes politicised, although the pharmaceutical companies and the US Food and Drug Administration have insisted an inoculation would only be authorised based on solid science. 

Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, and Kamala Harris, his vice-presidential running mate, on Tuesday called on the Trump administration to ensure that “politics will play no role in the approval and distribution of a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine”. 

AstraZeneca is commercialising the vaccine created by researchers at Oxford university under a [deal signed in April](https://www.ft.com/content/ddf8ec8c-dc30-43b3-847e-c412704a0296). To speed up the process, the drugmaker has begun manufacturing the jab before the trials are complete or the vaccine is approved. 

The partnership — which has received more than $1bn in funding from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency — has agreed to deliver [over 300m doses](https://www.ft.com/content/4b216c2e-2558-4308-b9c2-bf805b08e949) to the US government. 

The UK has ordered 30m of AstraZeneca’s potential vaccine. Matt Hancock, the UK health secretary, this week said it would “most likely” be available in early 2021.

Data from the vaccine’s earliest trial looked promising, producing robust immune responses and only mild side-effects, such as those that can be treated with over-the-counter painkillers. 

The initial phase two/three study did not include sites within the US but late last month the phase three trial, which will have 30,000 participants, began enrolling in the US. 

The trial was paused voluntarily by the drugmaker. Such decisions are normally made by an independent monitoring committee. 

Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert on the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, said AstraZeneca would need to examine whether the side-effect could have been caused by an immune reaction to the vaccine, or was likely related to the participant’s own medical history. 

“It all depends on what the problem was,” he said. 

In the early study, he said more than half of people had fevers. “When you give it to hundreds of people that may be all you see. But if you start to give it to thousands or tens of thousands, there may be people with a more robust immune response,” he added.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/ipc90e/astrazeneca_pauses_vaccine_trial_after_suspected/g4j2ycs/,Homer__Jay,1599641071

So if they have said that the UK can get a Canada style deal, it means that they want one at any cost? The UK has more to lose from a no-deal than the EU. The British government know it that's why their only last strategy is to threaten the EU.

&gt;3. Because if they make a deal now when there is still a time ahead, it means that some of the negotiators did a poor job and could try to win more, that's why the only reasonable thing to do now is to threaten to each others, otherwise both sides are not using time rationally.

303,"&gt; If you were to force people here to wear helmets, you'd see an increase in deaths, because many people would take the car instead

There is no indication that this statement is true. Germany introduced helmet laws for motorcyclist in 1976 without any diffrence in occurence of motorcyclists.

&gt; Helmets just aren't worth it.

Which metric are you basing this statement on?

A 2001 published meta study (RG Attewell et al.) [1] of 16 previous studies unmistakably indicate (N=~17000), that wearing a helmet is greatly reducing the possibility of bicycle related injuries like brain, head and facial injury. 

""[...] (helmets) provided conservative risk reduction estimates of at least 45% for head injury, 33% for brain injury, 27% for facial injury and 29% for fatal injury.""
""Helmet use for all riders should be further encouraged, to the extent that it is uniformly accepted and analogous to the use of seatbelts by motor vehicle occupants. The authors state that their results are applicable to riders of all ages, both in less severe crashes and in collisions with motor vehicles.""

I get when people decide for themselves, that it's not worth the hassle, but don't pretend there is a rational behind it. The science is clear. But unlike not wearing masks to prevent Corona spread, you are only harming yourself.

The federal subjects of Russia, also referred to as the subjects of the Russian Federation

Each federal subject belongs to one of the following types

**46 oblasts** \- The most common type of federal subject with a governor and locally elected legislature. Commonly named after their administrative centres.

**22 republics** \- Nominally autonomous, each with its own constitution, language, and legislature but represented by the federal government in international affairs. Each is home to a specific ethnic minority.

**9 krais** \-  Essentially the same as oblasts. The title ""krai"" (""frontier"" or ""territory"") is historic, related to geographic (frontier) position in a certain period of history. The current krais are not related to frontiers. 

**4 autonomous okrugs** \-  With a substantial or predominant ethnic minority. 

**3 federal cities** \-  Major cities that function as separate regions. 

**1 autonomous oblast** \- The only autonomous oblast is the Jewish Autonomous Oblast.

&gt; They actually used this excuse when that guy was poisoned in England

So?  Russian media and the foreign ministry have consistently put out a number of conflicting and implausible explanations for all of the international incidents that Russia's been involved with over the past few years.  I don't see any particular reason that they'd refrain from doing so now.  Hell, [Lugovoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Lugovoy), the Duma member who is believed to have poisoned Litvinenko, promptly went on record as stating that the German hospital workers must have poisoned Navalny.  What's the point in worrying about wild claims of conspiracies to commit false-flag attacks coming from the Russian government or media?  They're going to be claiming them no matter.

&gt; Besides, his opinion really doesn't mater much if he's not a political analyst and has no conections to the Russian Gov.

That's got some validity -- he doesn't expand on his rationale, and he actually says first that it's entirely possible that that was the goal.  I don't know what his thought process is -- it could have been that during the development, permanently disabling someone was considered a useful characteristic, or it could be that it was not.

I do think that the more-interesting points he made were on the technical characteristics.

But I do think that it's quite reasonable to say that he doesn't have any reasons to not provide his opinion on the matter, which was what I was getting at -- the comment I was responding to appeared to be under the impression that he wouldn't admit to anything because of culpability.

&gt;A ""defectors"" word isn't worth much to either side.

To be frank, based on our experiences over the past few years with repeated bogus claims regarding MH17, Salisbury, and so forth, I'll put ""guy somewhere in the US"" above Russia-the-state when it comes to credibility of his statements.  *He* hasn't built up a consistent negative record.

401,"-(i)ver as a suffix means quickly. 

•Markete git: Go to the market. 

•Markete gidiver: Go to the market quickly. (In this case, it has a side-meaning of request)

•Ödevimi yaptım: I did (completed) my homework. 

•Ödevimi yapıverdim: I did (completed) my homework quickly. 

But in everyday speech, we don’t use -(i)ver- very much. Instead, we generally add some adverbs such as “çabucak (quickly)”, “bir koşu (by one run)” and “bir anda (suddenly)”

Ödevimi yapıverdim. = Ödevimi çabucak yaptım.

Markete gidiver. = Bir koşu markete git. 

In that case, we use “bir koşu (by one run)” but it is used for stating of quickness, so the receiver of the sentence do not have to run in reality. If you want the receiver of the sentence run, then you could say “Koşarak markete git. (Go to the market by running.)",,/r/europe/comments/ip0vah/english_vs_turkish/g4icejb/,Sehirlisukela,1599619143

I don't think that Boris is particularly ideologically-attached to Brexit.  He didn't have an extensive history of promoting Brexit the way someone like, say, Nigel Farage did.  He famously wrote two articles, one supporting Remain, the other Leave, before finally deciding to take the Leave route and choosing to send that one in.  He's also occasionally had past pro-EU things he's written be pulled up to criticize him when he was running the Leave campaign.  Back during the Brexit campaign, I remember that a common criticism on /r/ukpolitics was that he was just a political opportunist, that his aim was to score some political credibility with Leave supporters by running the Leave campaign, which would position him nicely to be PM, no need to actually win the campaign.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/iowr6k/nodeal_brexit_is_the_most_likely_outcome_of_trade/g4ihz6b/,duisThias,1599622512
451,"That looks great for everyday and regular outdoor use, but might not be the most appropriate for multi-day hiking/backcountry since it's fleece and 'only' water repellent, rather than being a waterproof material like GoreTex or nylon. 

If it's just a day trip without any risk of rain that's more than fine, but for multiday trips (or places with unstable weather) the likelihood that you'll encounter different types of weather increases, especially if you're changing altitude a lot. The G3 looks a bit too thick to be used as a midlayer as well, so you'd probably overheat with an impermeable outerlayer. Layering is the bane of the rookie hiker's existence, since they usually only bring a huge jacket and can't dress down or up to suit the temperature. I'd hate to throw a rain jacket ontop of the G3 and hike for 8 hours in the rain.

IMO, it's better to buy a rain jacket and just wear normal long sleeved fleece shirts underneath than to get a fancy midlayer that can't handle proper rain.

596,"Actually you made a mistake and let me correct that. In Turkish, Present Tense and Future Tense are made in different ways, their grammar structure is DIFFERENT:

•Yüzerim: I swim. •Yüzeceğim: I will swim.  •Yüzebilirim: I may swim. •Yüzebileceğim: I will be able to swim. •Yüzüvereceğim: I will swim (In a quicker way than Yüzeceğim). •Yüzüverebileceğim: I will be able to swim (In a quicker way than Yüzebileceğim). 

(+)I can keep on expressing more forms of Future Tense, because of the flexibility of language, but I think it is enough for now. 

So you see the difference between Present Tense and forms of Future Tense.

Yüzerim can aldı mean “I will swim” as well but in a more uncertain meaning than Yüzeceğim. And of course, particularly this meaning of Yüzerim is mostly used among people, I don’t think TDK (Turkish Language Assembly) would recognise Yüzerim as a form of Future tense in formal Turkish.

602,"&gt; I think it's for the best.

I doubt that — I believe that it would have been possible to find a deal that would have been acceptable to both sides, and that there will be costs incurred by not doing so.

But I do agree that, while I'm on the outside looking in, it does seem likely that at this point, the gap is not going to be bridged, at least prior to the end of the transition period.

* Limited interest in having high-frequency meetings, so I'm skeptical that both sides think that they're on the verge of a breakthrough with a bit more face time.

* Statements from major figures on both sides (Merkel, Johnson, Barnier, now Juncker) indicating that they do not believe a deal to be the likely outcome at this point.  I think that they have little reason to play down the likelihood of an agreement.

* Betting markets also assessing no-deal as the probable outcome.

* Political spin on both sides in the media over the past weeks preparing publics for no-deal (""no deal isn't so bad"", ""no deal is the other side's fault"", etc).

I did see a few people on /r/ukpolitics spitballing the idea that there might be some ""mini-deals"" that are struck on uncontroversial-to-both-sides issues, but the scope of those would be limited.  I'd guess that that'd matter to very specific groups of people or industries or maybe people who have placed bets on a no-deal outcome more than people who are broadly-interested in low economic and political barriers between the EU-27 and UK.

And Polish wholesale power prices will rise with rising costs of ETS certificates and coal being harder to access or as larger domestic shares of coal are demanded. 

And of course the wholesale prices of coal ignore all externalities and subsidies. Even so, new PV is already close to beat the operating costs (!) of existing coal power plants. And with larger volumes being auctioned and along with the other factors I mentioned, especially ETS, coal will no longer make economic sense for the utilities, even without external costs.

626,"The word order of Turkish and Japanese are the same.
Ahhh man I have many friends learning Turkish and they are so pissed at the fact that the verb is at the end 😂 like when we say we like things we just name what we like first and then say ""I like"" but they always tell me they wait curiously what will come, do I like these things, hate these things, own these things? Which I find cool because it kinda forces you to listen 😄

Another very strange thing is even though Turkish is complex with all the suffixes, regular people hardly ever make mistakes. I was very surprised when my Portugese friend told me even politicians make grammatical mistakes, and I've seen 2 French teachers trying to figure out if a word was feminine or masculine. 
And Turkish is EXTREMELY easy to read, if you know the alphabet you can read literally anything in Turkish, which is quite motivating for people who begin learning.

Edit: Turkish also doesn't have any articles, grammatical gender, and has NO irregular verbs or adjectives. And the rules almost never have exceptions (just some words we took from other languages) which is pretty nice considering how much I suffered learning the exceptions and irregular verbs in English but it makes it very hard for Turks to learn other languages because all these stuff don't make any sense to us. Like, it's a chair, how can it be feminine or masculine? It's just a chair! 
Or just say swimmed, it works fine. Not even getting into pronunciation, a total nightmare for Turkish students. Why do you put so many letters if you are not gonna pronounce them?

Edit2: the grammar structure of present tense and future tense are the same, so one sentence can both mean ""I swim"" or ""I will swim"" Yüzerim.

We do not have perfect tenses. And my favorite thing ever, we have 2 different past tenses, one if you actually saw what happened and the other one if you didn't see but heard that it happened. It's very useful.

Generally speaking atleast inside the EU when in their home countries people don't expect the leaders to be at an actual high risk. Partially because stuff like guns aren't easily accessible by every nutsack that walks around. Stopping something like a dude who runs at a leader with a club is much easier than stopping someone who can draw a gun from the opposite side of the road.

Actually it might but not in the way you think. The company I work at which is the largest manufacturer in the UK, three times the turnover of the next largest competitor for what it does sources thousands of tonnes of manufacturing materials from one company which has two sites, one in England, one in Scotland. When the Scottish plant was shut during lockdown it was able to source all of its supplies from the English plant. It mainly sources from the Scottish plant because it sends loads for Scottish stores up on trunk runs and it makes sense to send those trailers back loaded up with manufacturing supplies than empty. 

Depending on what trade deal was done, if it became more expensive to source from the Scottish plant then they'd just stop doing so. Given the tonnage we take from that plant it would possibly make it no longer viable, it would certainly have a big impact and that would impact jobs and the local economy in a part of Scotland that can ill afford it.",England,/r/europe/comments/ioqs2n/how_long_will_it_be_before_it_blows_up_in_their/g4gu0t4/,MinuteNoodles,1599590951

&gt;(1) The Federal Republic of Germany is a democratic and social federal state.

&gt;  
&gt;(4) All Germans shall have the right to resist any person seeking to abolish this constitutional order if no other remedy is available.

Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western, its still Macedonia. What is rightfully disputed by Greeks is the obvious theft of history that Macedonian post-communists tried to do in order for them to distance themselves from Slavic origins, which was popular at the time during the Yugoslav civil war, dissolution of the country and nationalists taking over in new ""independent"" countries.

For example, in Croatia where I am from, they tried to teach us that our ancestors came from Iran and whatnot, just to distance ourselves from Serbs. Teaching that we are also Slavic was not allowed.

1019,"Most of it was only included in ancient Macedonia by his father’s time. But not talking about any claim to Alexander, just whether it’s reasonable to call it Macedonia, or especially North Macedonia. Well, it *was* part of ancient Macedonia.

The Greeks and Romanians also like to claim the name of ‘Romans’ due to historical expansion of the ancient state, even though they don’t include the actual ‘Rome’, nor the most famous ancient Roman figures. Only a part of their ancestry is Roman, and that goes for the Romanians too. Another example that comes to mind is Bulgaria (only a tiny minority were Bulgars, and the Bulgars came from the Volga before that) and Russia (which should then be centred on Kiev). Does this mean we should demand Greeks stop doing that or that Romanian, Russia, Bulgaria should change their names? Nah. 

It’s true that the dispute over the Macedon’s ‘Hellenicity’ was when Macedon only covered roughly what is now Greek Macedonia. But that just entrenches the irony further, I think. 

If you wanted to go back further we could speak of Paeonia, and even they only arrived a few thousand years ago. But historical names of regions have always evolved and been revived like this.

1288,"Like how many points I've made and you cant argue with then.
No one is removing EU citizens from the UK that's ridiculous and illegal. And as for people from non EU states. That's a different matter and not a reason to vote brexit.

You aren't looking at EU immigration policy for member states. Go look it up look up the legislation! You are still relying of the bollocks being force fed to you by politicians and biased news outlets. Go do you research! And I mean be thorough. Dont just look for information you agree with. Actively search for information that contradicts your world view and see how it all adds up. That's what I've done. 

Basically it boils down to the british people not being a fan of immigration (apparently), but the countries aging workforce, inability to train enough people for certain careers (NHS workers and social care workers for instance), and unwillingness to forefill certain roles (such as farming and labouring) means we rely heavily on freedom of movement to function.

It's also the reason that immigration probably wont change that much after brexit. BECAUSE WE NEED THEM. It'll also one of the reasons we will probably be reapplying for membership to the EU in about 10 years.

So politicians need to allow people into the UK to work but want to be popular too. So they use the EU as a scapegoat so they can have their cake and eat it. 

Gurbels once said ""If you tell a lie loud enough and for long enough, it become fact."" That's exactly what has happened with immigration in the UK.

In addition you have people like Farage, and Reese-Mogg who have made millions off the back of brexit (and are being investigated for insider trading for it). These people dont care about you. They care about lining their own pockets, and using you to do it. 

You need to take a step back and look at what you are reading. Who is saying it? Why? In what manner? And are they correct? 

Politicians are playing faster and looser with the rules now more than ever and it need to come to an end. Regardless of who you vote for. Vote with your head not your heart.

This is just what come up with on the top of my head, but it is surely just the tip of the iceberg of how the authorities tries to put a crimp in the nightlife.

Now the point is not that you can't enjoy a drink if the establishment has a kitchen, the point is that all of these unneccessary rules add up and completely cripples the nightlife.

Now you might say that a decent nightlife isn't everything, and that is fine, but to me as a young adult I view a decent nightlife as rather essential, so I am just giving you my perspective.

1327,"Are you sure it isn't just presented in that way because of the way that the chapters are divided? 

Amazon lets you [take a look at the Table of Contents](https://www.amazon.com/National-Geographic-Learnings-Geography-Tourism/dp/1133951260) and it seems that the authors do include all the Baltics and Eastern European states, just in a different section. 

The division of the countries is a bit strange, I guess, but Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine...they are all there, just grouped in with **Part 8: ...Russia and Its Neighbors,** the chapter after **Part 7: ...Europe**. Not all of Russia's neighbors are included in that section, either, probably because the authors chose to include, say, China and North Korea, in the East Asian section.

I'm not sure it is outrageous that the map they include in the book matches the way they have chosen to break down the countries in arbitrary regions. If you wanted to learn the borders of Europe (the continent) it's not going to help you much, but neither will it help you in listing off Russia's neighbors (China, North Korea, and they've included Tajikstan in that section of the book, too, though granted it is in the 'Former USSR in Central Asia' sub-section of the chapter).

1348,"Any Australian citizen between the ages of 18-30 can get a Tier 5 visa, all they need is around £2k in savings. That entitles them to live and work in the UK for 2 years. If they are skilled they should be able to find an employer willing to sponsor them when the visa runs out and can transition to a Tier 2. Alternatively, if they are in a relationship with a British national and meet the income requirement, they can stay in this country as a spouse, they don't even need to be married. 

Any Australian with a grandparent or parent born in the UK is eligible for an ancestry visa, which would entitled them to live and work for **5** years in this country. When that runs out they would qualify for indefinite leave to remain (i.e. permanent residency). 

A huge percentage of Australia's young professionals would find it really easy to move to the UK via either of these schemes.

1387,"&gt;which is really weird, because, at the time, alexander the great wasn’t considered a true hellenic person, he was from quite far up from compared to the major city states (athens, sparta, epirus, etc)

This is completely incorrect. 

First of all, Newcastle being ""quite far up from compared to the major city"" of London doesn't make it any less part of England.

Second, Alexander's father's goal (Philipp B') was to establish a federation of Greek states. This shows both that Macedon was ""major"" and ""greek"".

Source: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Macedon

Third, the very names ""Macedonian"", ""Alexander"" and ""Philipp"" are Greek, meaning ""tall one"", ""defends men"" and ""likes horses"" respectively in the Greek language.

So, if you don't think you guys are acting like stalkers, what would you personally call the harrasment of someone that keeps telling you to fuck off? A healthy relationship?

You keep bringing up the past when it suits you. You're arguing for your disgusting behaviour by saying that in the past it was okay and even reciprocated. Well, i got a newsflash for you, it's in the past. It hasn't been like that for nearly a century now. Or would you also argue that being a Nazi is okay because it was in the past?

And honestly, i have only a slight idea of what you're trying to say with your last paragraph. It's for the most part completely non-sensical. You're going on and on about Bavaria like a raving lunatic. Have you by any chance forgotten to take your meds?

&gt;It's more like germans

Just before you went on about how it doesn't matter how similar in culture you are and now you're bringing it up as an argument? Somewhat contradictive i'd say, but i'm not surprised all your comments have been full of contradictions.

I'll do you a favour though and address it nonetheless. I'd like to give you some food for though, consider how the situation is on the other side. Have you ever considered looking at the bigger picture? The only thing you keep talking about is yourself. You bring up Bavaria (which makes up only a 16th of Germany by the way if you didn't know) and point out the relative similarity between the bavarians and the Austrians. While at the same time you're completely disregarding the fact that Austrians are actually more similar in mentality and culture to the Czechs and the Slovenians than to Bavarians - who you claim are the most similar germans to us. Well where does that leave the rest of the germans?

1474,"&gt;I imagine because the UK was a relatively homogenous self governing island by that time, so we had no 'spring'.

I'd guess that it was because you guys took the incremental-reform route rather than the revolutionary one to disempowering the monarchy.  It sounds like anti-monarchism (or at least limiting the power of the monarchy) was an important factor in a lot of the revolutions that happened in the late 18th century and first half of the 19th century.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Revolutions

&gt; The Atlantic Revolutions were a revolutionary wave in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It was associated with the Atlantic World during the era from the 1760s to the 1870s.

-

&gt; In long-term perspective, the revolutions were mostly successful. They spread widely the ideals of liberalism, republicanism, the overthrow of aristocracies, kings and established churches. They emphasized the universal ideals of the Enlightenment, such as the equality of all men, including equal justice under law by disinterested courts as opposed to particular justice handed down at the whim of a local noble.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848

&gt;The Revolutions of 1848, known in some countries as the Springtime of the Peoples[2] or the Spring of Nations, were a series of political upheavals throughout Europe in 1848. It remains the most widespread revolutionary wave in European history.
&gt;
&gt;The revolutions were essentially democratic and liberal in nature, with the aim of removing the old monarchical structures and creating independent nation-states.

Wikipedia does list one incident from the wave in the UK (though calling it a rebellion seems a bit grandiose, given how far it sounds like it got):

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Ireland_rebellion

&gt;The Young Irelander Rebellion was a failed Irish nationalist uprising led by the Young Ireland movement, part of the wider Revolutions of 1848 that affected most of Europe. It took place on 29 July 1848 at Farranrory, a small settlement about 4.3 km north-northeast of the village of Ballingarry, South Tipperary. After being chased by a force of Young Irelanders and their supporters, an Irish Constabulary unit took refuge in a house and held those inside as hostages. A several-hour gunfight followed, but the rebels fled after a large group of police reinforcements arrived.
&gt;
&gt;It is sometimes called the Famine Rebellion (since it took place during the Great Irish Famine) or the Battle of Ballingarry.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/io7fax/what_nationality_was_copernicus/g4f4t70/,duisThias,1599548274

The shit-flinging baboon with the irrational positions is becoming more and more visible to the world, and our position with our allies keeps becoming stronger. 

Let me also ask you something about justice courts. Why doesn't Turkey accept to go to the ICJ? 

&gt; Lol Didn't you guys get taken over by a greek military Junta? Specifically a pro-Enosis junta that wanted to integrate Cyprus into Greece? Lol talk about level of sophistication. Wasn't the defacto leader of the nation after the '74 coup Nikos Sampson? The same guy that was itching to integrate Cyprus into Greece from British control?? It seems you don't even know your own history.

My dear friend, if you read my reply in a thorough manner you will see that I already mention your 1958 false flag attacks that had the goal to stir the population into something similar to the Istanbul pogrom of 1955 in order to give you an excuse to invade. You also tried to invade in 1963 when you instigated the so called bloody christmas as a way to get the Turkish public behind the operation. Therefore any reasonable person concludes that your invasion came as a predetermined action, and not as a response to our own actions. 

I do not talk about Greece's behaviour with the coup, because Greece was under a military dictatorship and I have no beef with them -most of them apologize for trying to coup us. You, on the other hand, invaded us and turned us into refugees under the pretense of preserving the Republic of Cyprus. This is what you signed in the treaty of Lausagne, to preserve the Republic of Cyprus -but you seek to eliminate it. You stepped all over your own signature, turned us into refugees and still deny us access to our own properties under your democratic system. This is why, even if France were to somehow accept you, you would never have a place in the European Union.",Cyprus,/r/europe/comments/iaom17/turkey_accuses_france_of_bullying_in/g4ey1k7/,roullis,1599542126

1572,"Okay, now you are comparing me to people who hate homosexuals because you played yourself?

And my final point to German ethnicity since you still only see it as aggression:

This German ethnicity is the ethnicity in Germany and only in Germany, not Austria and accepted in Germany, so the definition of ethnicity works, since it's the ethnicity of the people in Germany, not Austria. The foundation of this ethnicity, which is limited to Germany, is the German language. Those German states came together, not because of the shared culture, ideology, heritage or what ever (but it'd be a lie if I say that they had 0 value back then), the defining factor was the German language. We have states like Bavaria, we have Swabians, we have some Frisians, Saxons and so on. All with many similarities, differences but one thing we all have in common, unchallenged: the German language. This is the most important unifying factor on which our German ethnicity is based on, in Germany not Austria.

Now we elaborated the German ethnicity (in Germany, just in Germany, not Austria). But why are Austria and other German-speaking countries seen differently than other countries like France, Britain or Spain? Because said countries too speak German. See, there is no other way for Germans than to feel related to Austrians. Austria is no simple country XYZ on the world. It's like a cousin. Per definition, Germans, who all accept their German ethnicity, in Germany, simply can't completly exclude Austria and Co. It's not that they are seen equally, that's why I said cousins, while the German Federal States are more like brothers and sisters. It's okay if Austria wants to cut ties with this part of it's ""family"" but you know that doesn't mean that Germany is doing the same. You simply can't decide that we can't feel related, it's like if you demand from someone to stop loving but that's not how it's work.

And your mentioning of Pan-Germanism only shows that you see this on a national and political level, while I said multiple times it's not. It's not about another Anschluss. If you know want to continue to cry about your evil ""family member"", then do as you please but you can't change the fact that Austria and Germany are related. But you seem to be so desperate and full of hatred that you are blind.",Lower Saxony (Germany),/r/europe/comments/inj76h/mozarts_nationality_according_to_local_wikipedia/g4eyi9m/,CM_1,1599542519

&amp;#x200B;

You interpret it that way but read through Article 4 of the treaty of guarantee signed between England, Greece and Turkey ( I pasted a PDF transcript of the whole treaty below). The agreement suggested that the government was to be run in conjunction with the Turkish population. Turkish vice president and Greek President. Equally divided in the parliament but it failed miserably and the vice president along with all Turkish representatives pulled out of the government.  

 

&gt;The Thirteen Amendment  
&gt;  
&gt;The most serious constitutional problem the newly established Cyprus Republic faced in daily-life politics was the municipal issue. Turk Cypriots strived for the creation of separate municipals for Greeks and Turks while Greek Cypriots were aiming for mixed ones. Makarios took into consideration the probability of changing the constitution unilaterally, and despite warnings for constitutional collapse from the Turkish Republic, Greek Foreign Minister Evangelos Averoff and his cabinet minister Glafkos Clerides, he decided to go forward changing the constitution. Makarios calculated the political instability at Turkey and Greece, also he thought that his proposal would be backed by the United Nations. On the 30th of November 1963, Makarios handed a memo of 13 points to the Turkish-Cypriot side.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kucuk, Denktash, and the Turkish Government rejected the 13 amendments with furor. Turkish Cypriots filed a lawsuit against the 13 amendments in Supreme Constitutional Court of Cyprus (SCCC). Makarios clarified not to comply with whatever the decision of SCCC will be, and defended his amendments as being necessary ""to resolve constitutional deadlocks"" as opposite to the stance of SCCC. On 25 April 1963, SCCC decided that Makarios' 13 amendments are illegal. On 21 May, president of SCCC resigned due to the Makarios' disobedience to the laws of SCCC, thereby disobedience to the laws of Cyprus. On 15 July, Makarios ignored the decision of SCCC. On 30 November, Makarios legalized the 13 proposals.

2. Eat shit, you ignorant racist
3. Gobble my tight asshole, ideally anytime after 10AM once I have taken my morning dump

One of the reasons people cultivate the Ataturk that is when you about to lose something you love soo much you will try to hold on to that stronger than ever. This happened on '60s '80s and now. The Ataturk's ideas and reforms is a torch that he left us to find our way in the darkness of civilization.

My friend, thanks for expressing your ideas in a sensible way. We the Turks getting kicked down and pushed around on this subreddit due to bad things we did back then (I do acknowledge them all) or the behaviours of the current government. We don't have the control of either situation but still, it is still blamed on us.

Doing simple things like celebrating our independence or being proud of our culture gets insulted and humiliated by other Europeans. and I ask why when I support my country I viewed as a nationalistic and others as a patriot.

Outside of far-right parties, publicly endorsing and venerating Nazi war criminals, using Nazi symbols, and otherwise praising that past is relatively taboo. Holocaust denial is illegal. German school history curriculums tend to spend a chunk of time on WWII, the rise of the Nazi party, and German crimes.

Compare that with Japan, where historical revisionism is the norm, atrocities are often painted over, waved away, or denied. Which is ironic in some ways, as German atrocities were top-down and organized, while Japanese atrocities were often a failure of leadership to control their troops.

1652,"&gt;Just to clarify: I'm not arguing from the position of an outsider, but of someone who loves Japan and its people and has lived there for a while. I also read some books by Japanese historians &amp; journalists that I take as supporting my opinion.

That might be part of the problem; I don't know which historians and journalists you've read, but part of Japan's ongoing conflict is the failure of much of its academic and political establishment to engage critically with its past. Some textbooks are basically historical revisionism at its worst, the Yushukan and other museums are basically right-wing propaganda... there's lots of excellent Japanese scholarship, but there's also revisionism and apologists.

Again, that's part of the reason for poor relations; Holocaust denial is illegal in Germany and every citizen is educated about their country's role in WWII and the mistakes that led to the Nazi leadership, but downplaying Japanese atrocities is far too accepted and normalized in Japanese political and social life to be comfortable for many of Japan's neighbors.

That said, I love Japan as well, and have made it a point to travel there at least yearly for over a decade (though alas, Covid-19 restrictions have put the kibosh on that this year).

1700,"True, for everything that happened until this point, because of the education system. It has always been shaped to create nationalistic people who are incapable of criticism. I'm a teacher and I explain them why criticism is good because they ask me ""Teacher why do you hate Turkey?"" when I say 1 bad thing about Turkey. The education system is based on memorizing as much as possible, so much potential going to waste, so many kids going to religious cults after school for education. It is unbelievable. They are being brainwashed. And to be fair I have understood many things after being friends with foreigners and living abroad. Half of Turks don't even have the luxury to leave their hometowns. But I think people are seeing that finally, Turkey could be very different if there weren't so many uneducated people in poverty. If they could travel for €20 to another country (as I've done from Paris to Venice) if they could meet people from other cultures, if they weren't stuck in their brainwashing bubbles who tell them they will burn in hell if they show their hair (nowadays thanjs to social media at least they are able to see there are other realities, but they are often not able to interact with those realities) I'm seeing now even women in hijab criticizing the shit out of the government,  saying bad things about cults (especially after Gulen and the arrest of a pedophile cult leader) 
I want to, I have to, see this as the maturing of a democracy, and that things can change with a strong parliamentary system which was more democratic than the ones before, an education with history lessons that have the goal of learning from past mistakes (the biggest mistake of the Ottoman Empire was their inability to criticize themselves) lessons focused on doing rather than memorizing, lessons focus on questioning, religion lessons optional, banning cults and other religions brain washing, nation wide debates, education on democracy and human rights, and especially lessons showing how Ottoman Empire sucked. 
I'm teaching to middle school students whose parents don't even read or right, and most of them understand me. I tell them to question, to criticize and to consider both sides before choosing a side. And looking at all the statistics about the younger generation, I think things will change. Or maybe the generation after a real democracy is achieved. I have talked this with my father and he told me that every single generation in Turkey grew up in fear and that's not the best environment for a person to grow. We were always torn between the east and the west, never really belonging to either side but wanting to. I just think things can change if we finally have a good education system (based on question, learning from past mistakes and learning about different opinions) that is accessible to all the children.",,/r/europe/comments/iodfzf/turkeys_muscle_flexing_in_the_med_isnt_just_about/g4e8x9i/,kawaiibutpsycho,1599525514

1770,"&gt; Immigrants trying to cross the border from Mexico would count as a racial group,

Ice doesn't target the racial group, if they did they would be regularly targeting citizens and legal residents of said group intentionally and ignoring illegal immigrants of other racial groups. Mistakes does not prove intent, if they had an intent to destroy the racial group, it wouldn't be a mistake when they harm citizens. Can you say they have racist prejudices in how they conduct their mission? Absolutely, but they aren't indiscriminately targeting a racial group regardless their legal status.

&gt; as above destroy is not the only act,

It literally says ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part"". Having the intent to destroy this group has to be the intent otherwise it does not classify as genocide. Outright destruction isn't the only act, but it has to be the intention, the end goal. 

&gt; That being said genocide is a much broader definition than many people think

No, you just cannot read. It's a very specific thing where the intent of the person/persons is paramount. You go into a church to kill a bunch of people because you're angry at the world? Not genocide. You go into a church to kill a bunch of people because you want to eradicate that religious group from the face of the earth? Genocide. Same act but only one is genocide.

1788,"&gt; EU Army would be a nightmare, imagine a kindergarten class without the teacher(US) nudging them all in the same direction.

That is why a EU army should be created. The more stakes there is in the system, the more interest there is in keeping up the system. The more stakes there are into the EU, the more interest there will be in actually doing stuff which actually is beneficial to all of the EU than only the country/region. The less stakes there are, the less interest there is into keeping up the system.

That is also kind of the point of the EU.

That is also why a fiscal union should be introduced too, to increase the stakes in maintaining the system.

&gt; You should see Russia as a threat. They go to great lengths to destabilize NATO countries they spread conspiracy theories, fake news, interfere with elections and provide a great excuse for increases in spending

I do not regard Russia as military threat to the EU, though. And to be honest, it is quite a low bar to regard ""spreading conspiracy theories, fake news, interfering with elections"" as an actual threat to anything, especially militarily or even economically. The only credible threat Russia poses is EU's energy dependence on them (though they are also dependent on us). But that will not be reduced if you increase military spending.

Yes they do provide a great excuse for increased spending, but it still remains irrational, because the likelihood of Russia doing anything to the EU is close to 0, especially because it is Russia's most important trading partner. Turkey is by far a greater threat to the EU, and even then it's not a big one. And even then, it is still irrational, because even if they spend much per capita, it is still a small amount in absolute terms, meaning it won't even help them. It makes much more sense to invest that money into a wide spanning EU army, which actually would be able to help out.

And considering I'm against NATO myself, ""destabilizing NATO"" is not a bad thing for me. The faster we get rid of NATO, the more need there will be for an actual EU army. And as I said before, creating a EU army creates more stakes into the system, thus making destabilization harder.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/io959r/how_threat_proximity_dictates_military_spending/g4eeez9/,CDWEBI,1599528837
1789,"I mean, while I do feel bad for you, I can't help but think you must live in an area where connectivity would only be feasible through subsidies due to lack of passengers. Of course, subsidies \*do\* need to happen, but the government has sort of been pushing all the money into getting the 'core' high‐speed network finished first since it impacts more people than the legacy lines do. I don't see things changing for about another 10 years due to all the plans ADIF has for high‐speed expansion, but once the main high‐speed network is built, they'll probably start paying more attention to the 'remaining' population not being served by the new system. A big problem for them is that the money they invest in the old lines along routes where they plan to build new high‐speed lines is money lost since it'll soon be replaced. But given your location in Extremadura, I'd wager the problem isn't that; it's probably just lack of subsidies due to lack of population (essentially, neglect). And I'll agree, you're screwed at the moment if you live far from any place that is served by the new network (or which will soon be). If that's the case, then lack of rail is only one of probably a number of other problems too: lack of optic fibre internet, lack of jobs, lack of development funds, etc. And that, I'll agree, is something that the government definitely needs to work better on, since they've given rural Spain too little priority for decades now. I'll admit, this doesn't affect me personally, which could influence me to have such positive views of the Spanish rail network. But I hope that when you demand change the change isn't not to build out the new high‐speed network, but rather just to divert more to the legacy services in underserviced areas.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/io31qd/europes_railway_network/g4eeiwk/,AidenTai,1599528903

The only difference was that given the geography of Russian, Koutousov could juat backed and reform, instead of needing to sue immediately for peace. Also iirc Bagration died at the Moskova too.

Well it sure wasn't a decisive victory but pyrric could be debated. Tactical victory but strategic draw seems fair. Anyway, it's basically just semantics at this point. We still do have a Street of the Moskova in Paris though.

1825,"With the U.K.’s split from the EU set to be completed on Dec. 31, there’s no agreement in place that would allow aviators holding U.K. licenses to serve the bloc on anything other than British planes. The country’s Civil Aviation Authority has in contrast said it will continue to recognize EU documentation for a further two years.

That’s a particular problem for pilots at airlines such as EasyJet Plc, which has its headquarters in Luton, England, but flies from multiple bases across Europe using three different air-operator certificates.

Without a reciprocal deal, “there will be consequences for the efficiency of U.K. airlines and for the future of the U.K. pilot profession,” said Brian Strutton, general secretary of pilots’ union BALPA.

European airlines have already slashed more than 75,000 jobs, based on a Bloomberg tally, part of efforts to manage an anticipated sluggish recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. EasyJet is considering the removal of a third of pilot positions and has closed three U.K. bases, while Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. said Friday it will eliminate 1,150 more jobs to preserve cash.
Negotiation Period

The licensing issue for pilots mirrors concerns across other parts of the economy, with companies spanning broadcasting through financial services to architecture facing the prospect of having to establish an EU presence or acquire EU-recognized qualifications in order to legally operate in the bloc.

While the U.K. left the EU on Jan. 31, the agreement on how the separation would be managed included a transition period for the negotiation of a wide variety of matters on which the two sides remain far apart.

The CAA’s director, Richard Stephenson, said that pilots with U.K. licenses who want to operate EU-registered aircraft can transfer their license to an EU member state, as some pilots have already done. He added that the negotiations between Britain and the EU are ongoing.

The Department for Transport is seeking a bilateral agreement on aviation safety that would include mutual recognition of pilot licenses, according to a person familiar with the situation.

One EasyJet captain, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the company recently advised against converting U.K. licenses to European ones because of the ongoing uncertainty over the final agreement with the EU.

EasyJet’s British pilots have instead been told that they’ll operate U.K.-registered planes, but as those comprise only 50% of the fleet there are concerns that EU pilots will have an advantage as the carrier looks to cut jobs, the pilot said.
EasyJet, Ryanair

A spokeswoman for the airline said EasyJet moved the licenses for its European-based crew to Austria in November 2018, while confirming that U.K counterparts didn’t change theirs.

Ryanair Holdings Plc, Europe’s biggest discount airline, is based in Dublin and has its fleet registered in Ireland. It counts London Stansted as its biggest base and employs large numbers of British pilots. The company declined to comment on its licensing arrangements.

British Airways is less likely to be affected, since as a former flag carrier all of its planes are registered in the U.K. and most operate out of a single hub at London’s Heathrow.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/ioe8c5/brexit_threatens_to_strip_uk_pilots_of_right_to/g4dwtu0/,trolls_brigade,1599518559

1875,"&gt;*Nope, Nazism is not capitalism, it's national socialism, it's based on socialism*

Oof. Ballsy move, but you’re wrong and here’s why.

In *The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany* (1960), American journalist William Lawrence Shirer writes:

&gt;“Unfortunately for him, **he had taken seriously not only the word ‘socialist’ but the word ‘workers’ in the party’s official name of National Socialist German Workers’ Party**. He had supported certain strikes of the socialist trade unions and demanded that the party come out for nationalization of industry. This of course was heresy to Hitler, who accused Otto Strasser of professing the cardinal sins of ‘democracy and liberalism.’ On May 21 and 22, 1930, the [Führer] had a showdown with his rebellious subordinate and demanded complete submission. When Otto refused, he was booted out of the party” (ibid.).

In *Hitler: A Biography* (2000), British historian Ian Kershaw writes:

&gt;“[Hitler] was wholly ignorant of any formal understanding of the principles of economics. For him, as he stated to the industrialists, economics was of secondary importance, entirely subordinated to politics. His crude social darwinism dictated his approach to the economy, as it did his entire political ‘world view.’ Since struggle among nations would be decisive for future survival, Germany’s economy had to be subordinated to the preparation, then carrying out, of this struggle. This meant that liberal ideas of economic competition had to be replaced by the subjection of the economy to the dictates of the national interest. Similarly, any ‘socialist’ ideas in the Nazi programme had to follow the same dictates. **Hitler was never a socialist.** But although he upheld private property, individual entrepreneurship, and economic competition, and disapproved of trade unions and workers’ interference in the freedom of owners and managers to run their concerns, the state, not the market, would determine the shape of economic development. Capitalism was, therefore, left in place. But in operation it was turned into an adjunct of the state.”

In *The Coming of the Third Reich* (2003), British historian Sir Richard John Evans writes:

&gt;“In the climate of postwar counter-revolution, national brooding on the ‘stab-in-the-back,’ and obsession with war profiteers and merchants of the rapidly mushrooming hyperinflation, Hitler concentrated especially on rabble-rousing attacks on ‘Jewish’ merchants who were supposedly pushing up the price of goods: they should all, he said, to shouts of approval from his audiences, be strung up. Perhaps to emphasize this anti-capitalist focus, and to align itself with similar groups in Austria and Czechoslovakia, the party changed its name in February 1920 to the National Socialist German Workers’ Party . . . **Despite the change of name, however, it would be wrong to see nazism as a form of, or an outgrowth from, socialism**. True, as some have pointed out, its rhetoric was frequently egalitarian, it stressed the need to put common needs above the needs of the individual, and it often declared itself opposed to big business and international finance capital. Famously, too, anti-Semitism was once declared to be ‘the socialism of fools.’ But from the very beginning, Hitler declared himself implacably opposed to social democracy and, initially to a much smaller extent, communism: after all, the ‘November traitors’ who had signed the Armistice and later the Treaty of Versailles were not communists at all, but the social democrats” (ibid.).

Let’s hope you learned something here today.

And now you have the balls to complain about sturbborness and rightnousness?

Have you ever considered that Germany has it's own historic expiriences with Russia on a state level, going back millenia and including both massive conflict and extreme cooperation? That Germany has a pretty good grasp of how Russia works? That Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin are on the phone several times a year and that the German Government has more direct insight into his thinking and reasoning then probably anybody else outside Russia?

That there maybe are reasons why it was possible to fly Navalny to Germany? And that this is a long game, not just crisis management after crisis management?

Yeah.

&gt;And here we are. You do not hear about countries whose governments do  not disagree with yours so much, so therefore, their people ""are easily  bought with social money and in retuirn accept LGBT witch hunts and the  erosion of seperation of powers"".

I do not hear about countries which activly use Germany as a bogeyman in Politics, like in Poland, where before the elections Germany was accused of trying to influence the elections.

And lol. Ignoring what is happening there won't make any less serious. If it happens elsehwere, if it happens or not, it does not make it any less serious.

And you can bet, should I hear about such practices in other countries and a population in it's majority supporting it, I will change my mind in the same way I did with Poland and Hungary.

But for you these issues are not serious, just a blame game and geopolitically taking advantage, right? No idealism involved, just cynical exploitation. Bravo.

&gt;Nothing in the last paragraph of your comment seems very consciously  used. You are working mostly on vague sentiment based on what you read  somewhere online.Believe me the LGBT community has it no better in  Romania, than it has in Poland, and both countries are full of good  people. There is a difference between people and their government. I am a  gay man, and I am sure, not happy about the state of Poland, but as  their neighbour monitoring the situation around me, I have no doubt as  their geriatric government dies off, they will get their shit together  eventually, but that won't make them magically align their economic and  military policies with Germany.

Vague? Online? That is your definition of what is happening?

And how does it help that LGBT is treated similiar in Romania? In Romania you at least had massive prostests against the government, even succesfully bringing some polititians down. Romania is a backyed (sorry Romania), but a backyard that is moving forward.

Poland and Hungary are moving back. There lies the difference.

&gt;and both countries are full of good people.

I am aware. I met some of them in person. But for better or worse, these people are not defining either politics nor society in said countries. Most of them in fact do not try to defend these countries but want to fuck those governments more then even I do. And I can respect that.

And then there are people like you who due to hurt national pride find themselves defending these governments despite not even wanting to.

&gt;There is a difference between people and their government.

I never claimed otherwise, but in international politics, its the government of countries respresenting these people. (and on top of that, whenever I claimed the exakt same thing with Poles about WW2, these guys were the first to dismiss that and fuck all Germans. So please forgive me when I take your argument serious and agreeable, but not without a pinch of salt)

I never expected as much. There was a time it was suggested Poland would grow to the third largest member next to France and Germany and define a lot of eastern politics. Nobody saw a problem with that, quite to the contrary.

But when this country becomes openly hostile, working against your own country behind their backs, throwing accusations, tantrums, opens old WW2 wounds with lost territories and reperations, while at the same time dismantling democracy and activly supressing minorities, then maintaining friendly attitudes becomes hard.

1997,"The main problem is that decades of fearmongering has resulted in nuclear power becoming such a scary concept that it's incredibly rare for it to be considered, let alone implemented. People are irrationally afraid.

Don't forget, coal isn't safe either, oil isn't safe either, hydro isn't safe either. They all come with great dangers and risks. 

There have been 28 nuclear incidents, as a safety specialist I feel that's 28 too many, but coal alone causes more premature deaths per day, than all nuclear incidents since it's invention combined. That is by the way, completely ignoring climate change and the deaths we can expect from that. The media and politicians conveniently don't tell you that, now do they? 

What about the hundreds of oil spills that have devastated local wildlife? All of the fracking completely ruining ecosystems? What about all of the dams that broke, causing death and destruction such as the one in Brazil causing 270 deaths.

There are over 100 nuclear power plants in operation today. Of course I'd rather see solar and wind power being used instead, but they don't generate a lot of power and take up a lot of space and resources. We can't transition from fossil fuels to 100% renewable energy fast enough because of it. So instead we transition using nuclear power, that's all that people like me are asking for. 

The technology is well understood, it's affordable, generates a lot of power and is safer than it's alternatives by a huge margin. The only downside is that we need to safely store the nuclear waste and that's why the technology should only be used for the 50-100 year transition we need to get rid of fossil fuels. 

I personally would live on top of a reactor, it's that safe. The questions involved are not complex, nor hard to answer, the nuclear industry is actually leading in best practices that used in other sectors for improving safety margins. I personally used some of their methods and documentations in completely unrelated fields.

And Istanbul.

&gt; There would be no partitioning of ""Turkey"", if Sevres would have been implemented, since the majority population of the annexed areas was of non-turkish extraction (Greeks, Kurds etc.)

Hogwash. Prior to 1914 each drawn area in this image had a muslim majority, and all except the east had a Turkish majority.

&gt; Remember, this is before Mustafa Kemal started the Turkification process in what would later become Turkey.

After WW1 all of these regions were dominated by muslims. With the exception of Kurds, no ethnicity (ie: Circassians, Balkan refugees) represented a significant enough size or concentration to entertain the idea of a national state, which Sevres didn't provide for anyway.

&gt; Thats is a gross oversimplification. Greece invaded in order to force Kemal to accept the peace and to protect the Greek minority of Anatolia.

Greece invaded prior to Sevres (which was never ratified anyway). There was no peace agreement.

2090," Sailing through the Bosporus Strait that divides Europe from Asia last year, a Turkish fleet saluted the tomb of 16th century pirate and admiral Barbarossa, reviving a tradition that harks back to when the Ottoman Empire ruled the Mediterranean Sea.

Little noticed abroad, the tribute by sailors returning from the country’s largest-ever naval exercise now appears freighted with symbolism. As Turkey rebuilds its maritime might and contests disputed waters, it is once more in [conflict](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-03/how-turkey-is-spoiling-its-neighbors-big-gas-plans-quicktake-k4y6rpgh?sref=XNB4Nygj) with historic adversaries to the West.

International attention has focused on the race for offshore natural gas deposits in the Eastern Mediterranean that prompted not just Turkey, but also Cyprus, Egypt, Greece and Israel to claim rights in one of the world’s [most crowded seas](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-23/the-mediterranean-is-a-sea-of-political-troubles-again?sref=XNB4Nygj). Yet the roots of the tensions run deeper.

The growth of the navy reveals the scale—often dismissed outside Turkey— of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ambition to assert his nation’s interests as a specifically Muslim regional power, able to go toe-to-toe with Europe, Russia and the U.S.

Augmented by new domestically produced surface ships and submarines, the navy has already helped Erdogan to project force abroad with a success that has surprised and alarmed other littoral states. Larger frigates are in the pipeline, and a 27,000 ton light aircraft carrier is due by next year.

“Not far below the surface is a much more emotive set of issues, the idea that Turkey is the greatest power in the Eastern Mediterranean and should be treated as such,” said Ryan Gingeras, professor in the Department of National Security Affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in California and a specialist in Turkish maritime affairs. “It perceives itself as surrounded by rivals and adversaries and it will use strength to assert itself, because it can.”

The boom around Turkey’s naval shipyards is part of a wider expansion of the domestic arms industry—from warships, to attack helicopters, to armed drones—aimed at gaining what Turkish officials call “strategic independence” from Western suppliers, now seen more as rivals than partners.

Erdogan has set a target of 2023, the 100th anniversary of the Republic, for Turkey to provide all of its own weaponry. That’s unlikely to be met. There are also reasons to doubt whether a troubled $750 billion economy can sustain his great power ambitions in the current climate. The European Union is also threatening sanctions over Turkey’s activities in the region.

Still, Turkey’s military has forced its way into Northern Syria, ensuring a seat at the table in developments there. In Libya, Turkish warships helped supply and support the besieged government in Tripoli, turning the tide of civil war in its favor.

Turkish naval flotillas also now routinely escort seismic research vessels into Greek and Cypriot-claimed waters as they explore for gas. Last month, that resulted in a [collision](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-03/nato-says-turkey-greece-agree-to-talks-on-easing-tensions?sref=XNB4Nygj) with a Greek naval vessel as animosity between the two NATO members reached its highest point since a 1996 standoff over a pair of uninhabited Aegean islets that almost saw them go to war.

“Turkey will get its fair share in the Mediterranean, Aegean and Black Sea,” Erdogan said in a speech on Aug. 26 to commemorate the first Seljuk Turk defeat of the Greek, Byzantine Empire, at the battle of Manzikert in 1071. “If we say we will do something, we will do it, and we will pay the price,” he added, daring any nation to stand in the way.

A few days later, he marked another military victory over Greece, in 1922, by celebrating the production of Turkey’s first ship-launched cruise missile, as well as “space trials” for a liquid-propelled rocket. And on Saturday, he appeared to threaten Greece directly, warning it would suffer “in the field” if it didn’t reach a diplomatic settlement.

Just how literally to take Erdogan’s belligerence is unclear. In a recent Bloomberg News interview, his spokesman and adviser, Ibrahim Kalin, said Turkey aimed to pressure Mediterranean partners to consider and negotiate Turkish interests in the region that had for too long been ignored.

Greece says that islands must be taken into account in delineating a country’s continental shelf, in line with the UN Law of the Sea, which Turkey has not signed. Ankara argues that a country’s continental shelf should be measured from its mainland. Both sides have offered to sit down for talks, though there’s little prospect of that happening anytime soon.

Turkey’s forceful approach is getting attention from other Mediterranean powers, but it has also left the nation of 83 million looking isolated.

Last week, a Turkish navy website expressed concern at [Russian plans](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-03/russia-will-hold-naval-exercise-in-mediterranean-turkey-says?sref=XNB4Nygj) to hold live-fire exercises in the Mediterranean later this month. The U.S. partially [lifted](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-02/turkey-slams-u-s-decision-to-ease-its-arms-embargo-on-cyprus?sref=XNB4Nygj) a decades-long arms embargo on Cyprus, divided since Turkey invaded the north in 1974 ostensibly to protect ethnic Turks. In a show of force, France briefly flew high-powered Rafale jets to an airbase on the Greek-speaking side of the island.

Erdogan’s nationalist approach has broad political appeal, in a nation polarized between supporters of his brand of religious conservatism and of the secularism promoted by the Republic’s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.

“I’m a Kemalist, I’m totally against using Islam in politics,” said Cem Gurdeniz, a retired admiral and former director of policy planning for the Turkish navy. Yet he shares Erdogan’s belief that core interests of the U.S. and Western Europe are now opposed to those of Turkey.

In 2006, Gurdeniz produced the idea of an expansive [“Blue Homeland”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-13/turkish-war-games-set-for-three-seas-in-contest-over-gas-finds?sref=XNB4Nygj) in the waters that surround Turkey, which has since been taken up by the state. He describes that vision as a call to defend Turkey’s maritime rights, made in response to Greece’s stance. He ridiculed the idea that offshore islands should supersede mainland claims to as many as 150,000 square kilometers (58,000 square miles) of continental shelf.

“Their mindset is so simple: We left Anatolia after defeat in 1923, but we kept the Aegean Sea,” he said. “They think the Turks are a land people, so at sea they can take whatever they want. No, things have changed.”

Based on current construction plans, Turkey’s navy will soon outweigh its primary Greek competitor, long considered the stronger power at sea. A spokesman for the Greek Navy said neither the Defense Ministry nor the Navy would comment for this article.

None of this makes war between the two countries inevitable or even probable, but escalation risks are rising, according to [Hugo Decis](https://www.iiss.org/people/defence-and-military-analysis/hugo-decis), a research analyst focused on naval affairs at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based security think tank.

“What we should be really worry about is the development of a dynamic of fait accompli, where Turkey starts to take the same kinds of steps as China,” Decis said, referring to the militarization of reclaimed reefs in the South China Sea.

Last year’s massive naval exercise was itself called “Blue Homeland.” As the fleet honored Barbarossa, few personalities could have better reflected the growing rift in perceptions between Turkey and the West.

Remembered in Europe as a slave trader who ravaged the Mediterranean’s northern coastlines, Barbaros Hayreddin Pasha is revered at home as a brilliant naval commander who, in 1538, defeated a combined fleet of Christian powers. For a brief three decades, he turned the sea into an Ottoman lake.

“This is not an issue of Turkey’s internal politics,” Gurdeniz said of Turkey’s Mediterranean demands. “These are disputes that won’t go away, even if the government changes.”",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/iodfzf/turkeys_muscle_flexing_in_the_med_isnt_just_about/g4d2v9l/,BlackEagIe,1599504618

I doubt the ICJ would like to create a ruling based on these claims as a starting point for a compromise.

2114,"&gt; Huh, I was also under the impression he was quite influential.

See, this is what happens if you get your news from what's posted on social media.

Social media is what Plato proposted in 375 BC in his famous [Allegory of the cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave)

Quick summary: 
 
In the allegory, Socrates describes a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall from objects passing in front of a fire behind them and give names to these shadows. The shadows are the prisoners' reality but are not accurate representations of the real world.

People chained to the wall would make predictions and interpretations of the images they see, and cheer the ones that predict what will come next and interpret these shadows to what they think it's correct.

Plato then supposes that one prisoner is freed. This prisoner would look around and see the fire. The light would hurt his eyes and make it difficult for him to see the objects casting the shadows. If he were told that what he is seeing is real instead of the other version of reality he sees on the wall, he would not believe it. In his pain, the freed prisoner would turn away and run back to what he is accustomed to (that is, the shadows of the carried objects). He writes ""... it would hurt his eyes, and he would escape by turning away to the things which he was able to look at, and these he would believe to be clearer than what was being shown to him.""


This summs up social media, and it's consuption. Basically describing Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and so on.

2347,"&gt;PS: take your time to educate yourself on Odessa tragedy. Thinking of it as planned cold blooded murder aka Hatyn by pro-ukranian activists

I never said it was planned. I'm pretty sure, in fact, that it wasn't. It was a clash that was already turning deadly before one of the sides ran into the building and then the other one started behaving **exactly** like their ancestors did in Khatyn. Burning/finishing off the ones that were escaping.

Again - it could be considered an action of a small, marginal minority if not for the fact the **nobody was punished for it**. So...

&gt;I've heard that point of view, and really hope it plays out exactly like this. But I also think that Russia / government considers your country as their own more than any shard of USSR, and this adds uncertainty.

Well, I haven't heard any reasons yet as to why it's incorrect. What you described actually works to our advantage, as convincing **RUSSIANS** becomes an added problem in addition to convincing our population. They didn't have to be convinced in Crimea or Donbass - they were totally supportive and in full patriotic-fervor-mode. Propaganda about the evil fascists (Odessa helped with that immensely) did its job to make sure that everyone saw that invasion not as an invasion, but as *literally* saving people from slaughter.

Making that case here is *really* hard. They'd have to manufacture a huge number of provocations first.

&gt;It would be idle to deny that the banlieues are violent and sometimes scary places. I’ve often visited them during my 22 years in France. **Attitudes of the younger generations in the inner suburbs are hardening. They reject all authority — and especially that of the police.**

Yet pointing that out is racist? The author here describes exactly the same problem, but apparently that is OK, but if someone else does it, it is racist.

&gt;The violence in the banlieues, though endemic, is mostly internal — miserably so for this majority of law-abiding residents. Violent eruptions into city centers are relatively rare.

So? What is the argument here exactly? The violence is OK as long as it does not reach city centers, so fuck the working class living there?

The drop in crime is always mentioned in articles like this. And it is probably true, since especially young people who do most of the crime have more stuff to distract them. But what is missing out here is that those immigrant groups are still overrepresented in crime, so imaging how much less crime there would be if they weren't. And also take into account that not everything that makes people feel unsafe is a crime, let alone reported. Are you going to report someone threatening you on public transport? Probably not.

Then there are over-the-air updates extending to vehicle performance. The extent to which Tesla offers these features is not really matched by other companies.

2428,"&gt; What's your point? 

As mothers cannot really be very old, births by a specific country of origin indicate a history of recent immigration. I was not pointing out the children, but their mothers. Who are Britons. Aged 45 or under.

&gt; Likewise, those babies are Brits.  

You must be confusing Britain with the US, there is no *jus soli* in Britain.

&gt; When the numbers are relatively low, the whole balanced/unbalanced thing is meaningless 

Relatively low? British-born people were [1.087.000](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1819/Quick_Guides/PopulationStatistics) at the 2016 census (the highest number ever, btw) and are 4.5% of the entire Australian population. The UK does not have any immigrant community of comparable size (it would be 3.000.000 in size).

&gt; It's never going to be a 1 for 1 exchange, there are 65 million Brits and 25 million Australians; I'd expect 2.5x as much antipodean bound travel than the other if all else was equal. 

Even taking this into account things are lopsided, as the ratio is significantly higher than 2.5:1. Also, by this logic, the migration exchange between Britain and the EU was perfectly balanced as well as long as the number of Europeans moving to the UK was less than 6.6 times bigger than vice-versa.",,/r/europe/comments/io3l1h/tony_abbott_ukaustralia_freedom_of_movement_could/g4bifar/,Robi_damian,1599475348

As for the Illyrians being Albanian. It is proven. There are hundreds of words that have direct meaning in Albanian. Read scientific research that has been made for this. Even the name Albanian comes from the Illyrian tribe Albanoi mentioned by Ptolemy in 150 AD. The proof is there, it’s just a question of whether you want to see it. We could argue all day, you could argue that “who cares if illyrians are their descendants, we occupied this land for centuries we have a claim to it, the Albanians can argue “we were here first you are only occupiers”.

2461,"""The fact that price’s do not increase is also due to production cost drop."" - Not necessarily true.

The high end consumer products are always bought from trusted retailers. ( think IPhone or a professional tool ) . 

Amazon went balls deep in on nonessential goods. And destroyed the small shops that had 3 really cheap products, 3 medium products, and 1 top tier product. You, as a seller, in a small shop, need to convince the customer that it is important to see the difference. To get the customer out of the house and into your door, to ask and to stay afloat while juggling 7 different things. This is also available in Amazon, you order 7 different products, keep what you want and send the rest back. Amazon wins, customers win, the seller louse. 

And, the European mentality in different regions: buy things that are made to last. This became evident when the right to repair initiative passed with reasonable ease. I was expecting one hell of a close race with heavy lobbying on the side of big corporations. ( those corporations are up to something ). But the close meme law that caused a big stink and a lot of regular folks took notice. ( I mentioned before that laws are way outpaced by the development speed of the internet community ).

Not that I couldn't see a world where UK-outside-the-EU did financial services trade with the EU, but come on.  This issue is not new, and it's kind of silly to complain about it in September 2020.  The fact that the EU was not going to grant irrevocable access to provide financial services and intended to use revocation of financial equivalence as a political lever was openly-stated in European Parliament documents.  It was one of the first points I recall raising as a point of friction after the referendum on the sub.  Switzerland and the EU had a similar spat with the EU revoking equivalence status, and there was plenty of discussion about the similarities with likely use of UK equivalence status in the media.  The British government evaluated the impact on financial services early on.

The UK did not get blindsided in late 2020 with this.

Is it playing hardball?  Yes.  Is it abusing the purpose of equivalence?  I'd say so.  Did the UK know perfectly well about this and have lots of time to adjust to it?  Yes.

If the EU position on financial services access were truly a fundamental point of disagreement, then the negotiations could have been terminated long ago.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/322874/electricity-consumption-from-all-electricity-suppliers-in-the-united-kingdom/

Scotland definitely doesn't need enough storage to last the whole of the UK for over a month with absolutely no power generation at all, about 1/10 of a year. Maybe the UK as a whole needs that much, an amount which could last for months on end if power generation falls, but Scotland alone doesn't need that much.

Given that the population compared to the whole of the UK is less than 1/10, 30 TWh would seem to roughly last Scotland over a year with absolutely no power generation. That would be completely unnecessary.

One new liquid air storage facility in Greater Manchester will be 50 MW storage capacity, with max output of 250 MWh, when it opens.

https://www.edie.net/news/8/World-s-biggest-liquid-air-battery-under-construction-in-Greater-Manchester/

The same article says that Highview Power and Carlton Power are planning 1 GW of storage. Thurrock Power 600MW in a single battery. There are a few more mentioned.

Also, we have all wasted electricity for decades by not balancing our grids, just roughly putting in enough in response to demand. We are going from an extremely low base in terms of amount of energy storage, so using terms like ""orders of magnitude"" when talking about the increase seems sensationalist, as if it would be an insurmountable obstacle despite the increases already planned being huge relative to the low starting base.

This article says that National Grid confirmed they had only 1GW of capacity reserves in August 2019. 

https://www.current-news.co.uk/blogs/long-read-how-energy-storage-helped-save-the-uks-grid

The Manchester site alone will increase storage by a significant amount. The Highview Power and Carlton Power plans alone would double capacity.

The lands of Tuscany are fertile with intellectual thought, as all of Italy stands on the precipice of the Renaissance. New ideas about life, God, and, most importantly, government, are spreading across the Italian Peninsula and giving all the region's rulers something to think about. The Medici family of Florence in particular seemed ready to take the changes in philosophy and government in stride, and are worth keeping an eye on. If they followed all their ambitions, they could become Popes, or discard the last pretenses of republican rule in Florence and turn the country into a monarchy and themselves into rulers of all Tuscany.
Such ambitions will not go unchallenged. South of Tuscany, the Papal State will begrudge any interference with its rule, whether by territorial conquest or an attempted takeover of the Curia. To the north, The Republics of Genoa and Venice seek to expand their sprouting trade empires. Wedged between powerful neighbors, it would take all the canny wiles of a modern ruler to survive the machinations of popes and princes and come out on top.

One such ruler was Cosmo de Medici, whose diplomacy secured continued good relations of the Papal States. He also chose the Venetian Republic as an ally, seeing as their interests align more than they cross each other. He also wanted to join the new Crusade on Byzantiums side, but it was decided it would be better if he safeguarded Italy while Venice and his Holiness are waging war against the Turk. Sad to not take part in the glory, he oversaw the unification of Tuscany, or would have, if he hadnt found an early grave in 1447. The other noble houses of Firenze took the opportunity and ousted the Medicis from office and city and elected one of their own. Thus began a string of fairly incapable rulers. So far the people are still content though, and do not yearn for the return of the Medicis.

In two wars that took longer than expected, the rival city of Siena was vassalised, while the duchy of Ferrara was awarded to the Pope. The other was the conquest of Lucca, which was allied to the mighty Milan. But Genoa also declared on Milan, and thus a stalemate began with neither side wanting to peace out first. After almost 5 years, Lucca would finally accept annexation, and the city of Parma was released as a vassal. Our allies in Venice incorporated the fortress of mantua in the meantime. Genoa then Vassalised the remnants of Milan, and rivalries were declared between Genoa/Savoy and Florence/Venice. 

Alliances were forged and schemes were hatched, and the council of Florence put all efforts to strike at the rival in Genoa when finally an opportunity arose. The Florentine scouting ships saw the Genoese army depart from Italy and sail towards Anatolia, to wage war on the Empire of Trebizond. With assurance from the Genoese ally France that it would stand idle if a fair war would be waged, Florence contacted his allies, the Pope and Venice, to join ina war against Genoa and Savoy. The Pope would rather bring the crusade to Africa, but Venice agreed under the condition it gets the island of Scio and the city of Milan in case of victory. And so the troops were marshalled, some additional generals and mercenaries were hired, on our behest the Pope excommunicated Genoa which gave us just more legitimacy in our endeavour and war was declared!

The combined Venetian and Florentine navies blockaded the Ligurian coast, and the Florentine army went on to lay siege to Milan while Venice besieged Genoa. Meanwhile, Savoy was getting ready but with the Genoese army still amiss, couldn't do much but watch. A naval barrage was ordered on Genoa, and the walls crumbled. We could see how Genoa hired more an more Mercenaries in Albenga and were getting ready to retreat, but we won the siege in time. It could not have taken a moment longer, because we then saw that the Genoese army had snuck past our naval blockade and arrived in Italy, apparently having landed in Valencia and marched through France. The Milanese fort fell soon after and the Venetian and Florentine armies advanced into Novarra, Albenga and Montferrat, when the Savoyard and Genoese commanders finally decided to strike back and prepared to attack the army in Montferrat. Quickly the other venetian and Florentine army got ready to reinforce, and a big battle raged for days, with no clear victory emerging, until in the last days the luck of battle swung into Savoys favour and our armies were sent packing. It was no decisive defeat though, as 42k men had fought 42k men and our side had lost 17k while theirs had lost 13k. But that was the end of the Venetian manpower reserves, still strained by the earlier (but succesful!) crusade against the Ottomans.

Quickly we consolidated our forces and reinforced our armies with more mercenaries while the Genoese side marched to recapture their capital in Genoa. They stood there with 50k men, making an excellent target, but our recovery was not fast enough and they realized their mistake and spread their forces out again. When Venice and I were in position again, Florence marched in first, telling Venice to reinforce, but Florence had forgotten one crucial aspect of warfare: Intelligence! From the very start of the battle it became very apparent that something was not right and it was quickly realized what was happening: Genoa had made new advancements in military technology, our troops were getting slaughtered and the Venetians barely managed to arrive before we were beaten. We were sent packing *again*, this time the casualties were worse: In a battle of 50k Genoese/savoyards vs 43k Florentine/Venetian troops, their side lost 6k while ours lost 27k! But with this cruel reminder of intelligence, our spies notified us that Genoa could not keep this up for much longer, as they were nearing bankruptcy, while we had only taken 3 loans at this point. So the army was rebuilt *again*, and it almost went disastrous because the Genoese Trade league member of Verden had snuck behind us and attacked our forces in Treviso before morale had recovered, but through timely reinforcement of troops with morale we beat them back and could reorganize.

After that defeat, Venice had also advanced in military technology, and we would soon follow, so we contemplated waitng them out or trying again in Genoa. Seeing as we still had few loans and over 15.000 manpower reserves, we calculated we could afford another loss, but if Genoa would recapture its capital they could afford more loans, so another attack was started, this time with Venice as General to benefit from its better tactics. Venice marched in with 22k while Florence was watching form the hills. The Savoyards and Genoese entered the battle early, but the Tuscans entered just in the moment the Venetian frontline started to crumble. It was still a hardfought battle, but this time victory should be ours! Our side: 47k men, 17k losses. Their side: 58k men, 20k losses. After this, a diplomat was sent to Savoy offering white peace, which he accepted. Soon afterwards the Kingdom of France, which held its word, also accepted white peace and then, on December 15th, The Republic of Genoa unconditionally surrendered and a peace was signed in Genoa, transferring the Cities of Albenga and Genoa to Florence, and the city of Milan and the island of Scio to Venice, as well as paying some ducats as recompensation. The mercenaries were disbanded and thanked for their service and our troops were home by Christmas!

2736,"Since mid-March 2020, EU Member States have taken restrictive measures to slow down the spread of COVID-19. These measures included the closure of factories, schools, restaurants, bars and hotels, and required people to stay at home. Many companies lowered production levels due to a lack of demand or because of interruption to their supply chain. These measures were in full force for the entire month of April 2020. By the end of May and continuing into June, many countries started to partially remove restrictions and the tourism season began.

However, June data show a lower electricity consumption in most Member States. The total EU electricity consumption in June 2020 was 7.6% lower than the lowest June value recorded between 2016 and 2019.

When compared with the lowest June level since 2016, Greece, Spain, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland and Slovenia show a decrease of more than 10%. As tourism is an important sector for the majority of these countries, it is probable that a reduction in the number of tourists led to a decrease in electricity consumption. The tourism sector has seen a major decline due to countries issuing travel warnings and imposing quarantine measures. This can be seen in the tourism data for June.

Seven Member States (Denmark, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Austria, Portugal and Finland) show a reduction in electricity consumption of 5% to 10%, while for eight Member States the drop was between 1% and 5% (Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, France, Hungary, the Netherlands, Romania and Slovakia). In Latvia and Lituania, the situation remained stable (up to +1%) and the remaining countries (Estonia, Ireland, Malta and Sweden) reported an increase in electricity consumption compared with the lowest June level.

Although Denmark and Bulgaria show increasing electricity consumption from March to May 2020, in June both recorded a reduction in electricity consumption compared with the lowest reference month between 2016 and 2019.

Abe Shinzo and many others venerate and repeat the slogans of Japan's WWII era leaders.

It's be like if Germany was still run by the grandchildren of Nazis, had been run by former Nazis since WWII, and they were mostly Holocaust deniers who called for a return to the glory days.

The fact that ""de-Nazification"" never took place in Japan is one reason why relations between Japan and the rest of Asia are still so tense even today.

2891,"For one they're, like us, a lot less intrusive than germans. Czechs and Austrians tend to keep to themselves while germans tend to butt into things that don't concern them. Czechs and Austrians tend to be subtle about things, they try to not unnecessarily ""hurt"" someone, whereas germans tend to be quite straight forward about things. If a german doesn't like something they'll say it to your face straight if an Austrian or a Czech doesn't like something they will subtly drop hints towards it. And this subtle hint dropping works just fine within Austrian and Czech societies, but as soon as someone not used to these things gets involved, like you, it turns into a mess cause they tend to be completely oblivious to those hints. Germans have a certain ""customer is king"" mentality that Austrians and czechs don't have. Quite a few germans if they want something from someone they don't ask for it but demand it. ""Ich krieg das/Ich bekomme das"" or sometimes even just ""&lt;Das&gt; (insert whatever they want here)"". No please, no thank you, no could/would/whatever. Which is very different to how Austrians and Czechs do it. Humour also is a point of contestion. There's a funny little encounter (warning, sarcasm) that i had with a german at one point that i like to bring up as an example whenever this topic comes up. And also funnily enough, since you brought it up yourself, this encounter was with someone from Saxony, judging from their accent. In Winter when i was skiing and going up the gondola there was these germans with us in the gondola. I was talking to my friends and we were joking around about how many people there are on the slopes, how bad they are and that we'll push them over on our way down. It was painfully obvious that we weren't serious, but the germans next to us apparently didn't understand that and proceeded to give us a lecture about how we're complete jerks and that everyone has to start skiing sometime bla bla bla. See, i work in tourism and making jokes of that kind is always completely fine when they're czech but are absolutely to be avoided if they're german, cause apparently you don't get that it's sarcasm.

2893,"&gt; Nope, I can't really see that happening either. Turkey's economy isn't important or large enough for the UK to gain anything significant from it.
&gt; 
&gt; If the UK will want to cooperate with a non-EU country within Europe it's most probably going to be one of the three that could easily join the EU if they wanted it. In other words, Norway, Switzerland and Iceland

Iceland's economy is tiny, only about three percent the size of Turkey's.

In Norway's case, as I understand it, the reason that they aren't in the EU is because the public objects.  If the leadership had a free hand, they'd be in, and the EU would go along with it.  My guess is that they're basically waiting for an opportune time to get joining past the public.

Switzerland and the UK might act on some things, but I think that no matter how stubborn the Swiss are, geographic realities are going to keep them and the EU on pretty much the same path.

Turkey's the closest major economy in the European region that has much separation from the EU.  As you said, I have a hard time seeing Russia and the UK getting along on much.

&gt; But overall, the UK will most likely look for closer cooperation with the other countries of the Anglosphere (USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) as well as it's commonwealth while trying to strike a trade deal with the EU and other countries in Europe and the rest of the world.

I don't disagree that that will probably happen to a greater extent than in the past, but they're also quite some distance away.  If one aims to do much with anyone of any size near Europe aside from the EU, Turkey's kind of the only practical game in town, and Turkey and the UK do actually trade a fair bit today. Both are decent-sized countries on the periphery of the EU. Both are among the few European NATO-but-not-EU countries.

3003,"&gt;Russia never wanted free/unified Bulgaria.

It's amazing that so many people believe this, considering the San Stefano and Berlin treaties.

&gt;They wanted a colony in the Balkans that would give them easy access to the Mediterranean and Istanbul.

Then obviously a Bulgaria that actually reached the Aegean would be far more useful

&gt;When their plans failed, they wanted to ensure that at least the countries in the Balkans will be small and weak so can easily be controlled.

Apart from contradicting basic history, this is also completely illogical. A larger Bulgaria would have far more need of protection from Russia than a smaller one. For example, Bulgaria in San Stefano borders would immediately face Ottoman, Greek, Serbian and Albanian irredentism. Under these conditions the Bulgarians, apart from being even more grateful to Russia, would never dare to spoil relations with Russia, lest they be left without protection against all these enemies.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/inj020/today_135_years_ago_bulgaria_was_unified/g49yhtc/,GMantis,1599431922

3022,"&gt;He declared turkish superiority which meant ubdeniable derision of minorities. He carried out Armenian genocide. 

1st point this is often misunderstood Atatürk said ""Ne mutlu Türküm diyene"" which basically means ""Everyone that says that they are Turkish is/should be happy"". He said this as anyone that calls themselves part of Turkey is/should be happy. While I am aware this doesn't make sense in English it's more of a lost in translation thing.

2nd point is Armenian Genocide/Forced relocation (to not offend anyone) happened before Atatürk was the leader, it wouldn't be fair to blame him for it.

&gt;  just like Erdogan he ruled with an iron fist, imprisoned opposition and killed tons of people who did not follow his rules. 

This is kinda true if you look at it during the war(""Istiklal mahkemeleri""). But after the war no such thing happened. There were islamic newspaper's that didn't agree with Atatürk that saw no retributions.

&gt; Lastly when president was democraticaly elected in system that he personally helped to build he staged coup and hung him because he did not agree with his policies.

This is by far the most wrong thing about Atatürk in your statement and the reason I say that is very simple. When Atatürk became Atatürk and started to lead Turkey as president, he stayed president until his early death(because of alcohol, cigarette and stress). As he never left the presidency seat this couldn't and didn't happen.

Is this a positive thing to say about Atatürk? Probably no, but your statement is an outright lie, as Atatürk was the only president so he couldn't have hung the president?

&amp;#x200B;

While I don't think Atatürk was the best leader in the world. Atatürk was definitely was one of the better ones.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a Turk that migrated as I am an atheist and Turkey is really going towards dictatorship/islamic state and I hate it.

While I unlike other Turks do not claim Atatürk was the perfect being, please don't compare him to literal cancer(Erdoğan). While Atatürk being a good leader is open for debate, he is definitely  leagues ahead of Erdoğan which would be somewhere in top twenty worst leaders in history list.",,/r/europe/comments/ikogf0/german_news_agency_die_welt_claims_from_inside/g49yw3m/,kemal1132,1599432163

Without a doubt it wouldn't be as important to us as an FTA with the EU. I certainly won't deny that.

It would also give us access to a very large Market worth 42% of the global trade. Not to be sniffed at really.  
This is why the UK can't be a rule taker with the EU. It would stifle us getting any other good deal.  
For the UK we would prefer an FTA with the EU, the US and join the CP-TPP. It would mitigate most of the economic damage and allow us to feel independent again.

Yes - and apparently that's what's going to happen. 

So why are leavers so upset with the EU? 

EU has very clear (maybe not clear but extensively agreed upon) rules on trade. They offered a deal in line with other countries in the immediate vicinity with several years to negotiate the details. UK chose to do nothing until the very last minute. I suspect the the leavers actually believed in their own fantasy of keeping all the benefits while ditching the obligations.

Didn't work, obviously.

EU is not a state, it's an elaborate set of agreements between (now) 27 countries. It's not free to just change the rules on a whim. UK had several years to achieve something. Nobody understood why they didn't even try.

3249,"We have access to mapping tools, so you can estimate the area the crowd occupies, and from there it just depend on the density. More or less you can take those references: 4-5 people/m2 is a busy metro wagon, 3 people/m^(2) is a military formation on the march, 2 people/m^(2) is a dense crowd, while 1 person m^(2) is what usually a crowd or political rally has on the march, when they have no obstacles or chock-points.

On the photo you can see that the crowd has [less density than 1 person m2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgrVmivYybo). The average width is 30 meters, while the length that can be observed on the photo is 1500 meters. That gives us 45 000, at best 50 000 m^(2) of space occupied by the crowd on the photo.

Now it all depends on the density, it is very hard to estimate the exact density with that perspective. The photo is also not very representative, because it shows one of the rally ""tails"" the closest to us.

So on the photo there might be between 20 000 and 40 000 people. Which is a sane estimate. To have 200 000 people on the photo, the density should be more than 4 people/m^(2) which is impossible for a crowd on the march, you can see such density only in metro or on concerts near the stage.",Bunker,/r/europe/comments/inmfg1/belarussian_protests_continue_over_100000_people/g4996al/,IvanMedved,1599417751

3268,"&gt; that take people saying this a bit too personally

I think that's understandable though. I don't know how it is with you swiss, but as an Austrian there's a good chance you'll get called ""german"" at least once a day. Any kind of topic that involves Europe's history, just like this one right here, (and there's loads of them on here or on /r/MapPorn for example) eventually devolves into people not talking about history anymore and outright calling modern Austrians germans. Sometimes you get pulled into it (just like right here) but mostly it seems, at least to me, that it's all directed towards Austrians. It's bad enough that apparently Austrians aren't allowed to have their own ethnicity but its even worse on top because we don't like the germans, so it's like adding insult to injury. If this happened maybe once every half a year i doubt there'd even be many people batting an eye. But it happens sooooo frequently and there's a good chance as an Austrian that you'll be called a german at least once a day.

&gt;but yes, I agree. We're not. Describing myself as German honestly wouldn't even occur to me.

As for treaties and such here are some pointers:

- the muslim minority in Thrace consists from 3 groups: Turks, Pomaks, Gypsies.  Pomaks and Gypries dont identify as Turks.

- The muslim minority in Thrace is mentioned in the treaty as such ""muslim minority"". 

- The muslim minority in Thrace whatever injustices they might have faced are there, living in their houses, having their properties, increased their numbers.  The Greek minority in Istanbul was wiped out. Completely.

- The muslim minority in Thrace has it's own members in the Greek parliament. 

- Today is the date of a terrible and unjust pogrom. To level it out with whatever injustices Greece might had done is whataboutism and only shows that you dont understand what really happened.

3436,"Well the fact that mozart himself spoke of a German nation kind of proves that some concept of a German nation existed during his lifetime even though it isn't exactly the same as today. Also while not being its official name, ""holy roman empire of the german nation"" was a term which can be found in multiple sources dating from the middle ages and was in use following a decree of the 1512 imperial Diet of Cologne until the end of the 18th century (which by the way means that during mozarts time, the HRE was considered a nation by its inhabitants) which begs the question: If the word nation predates us by centuries and was used in conjunction with the HRE, who are we to tell them, that they weren't a nation and why should our modern definition count to decide whether or not they were a nation?

The HRE was not ruled by Austria. At least not Austria the country but rather the house of Habsburg which by the way originated from Switzerland. It wasn't uncommon for different houses to rule the HRE for multiple generations and the Habsburgs were merely the last of multiple dynasties which were **elected** to become kings of Germany and leaders of the HRE. Rulers of the HRE often gained the name ""of Germany"" after ascending to throne just like rudolf of Habsburg (first habsburg ruler of the HRE) was called Rudolf I of Germany after his election.

The first ""Austrian emperor"" was Francis II (1804) after stepping down as the holy roman emperor due to napoleon. Austria was very much a thing during mozarts times and referred to the archduchy of austria which belonged to the habsburgs. The archduchy of austria was a principality and therefore a part of the holy roman empire. However, the habsburgs held territories in- and outside of the HRE and not every territory which was ruled by the habsburgs was german-speaking.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/inj76h/mozarts_nationality_according_to_local_wikipedia/g48gc8p/,Papa-Yaga,1599403435

3484,"&gt; No they don't.  

Geely literally said in February that they wanted merge Geely and Volvo and also a listing on the stock exchange. In practice Volvo Cars goes up in smokes I guess? Not the brand but the entity that is Volvo Cars. and the Ceo of Volvo said all the back in July last year that they might have to leave Sweden because ""kompetensbrist"" because the Swedish engineers don't know how to design electric engines only petrol engines at least according to him. So far LAS stops the massive lay off of 20 000+ people. Although a week ago he said Volvo will stay in Gothenburg even after a merger but I dont see how that goes together with the ""kompetensbrist"" he himself mentioned the year before, I have a hard time seeing that they just in a year found a ton of engineers that can make electric cars.

&gt; Having production in Sweden ensures direct access to the EU single  market. You also have the brand image, entirely relocating to China  would remove the image of Volvo = Sweden. 

I can't speak for Volvo Cars, it's what they said I have no idea what their idea of branding is later seeing as they want to merge Volvo and Geely completely.

&gt; The production that has been relocated away from Sweden, so far, is due  to the limited production capacity of the plant in Gothenburg. Volvo  trucks has a plant in Gent, etc. Again, Sweden has a very small  industrial capacity. Volvo cannot meet global demand using production in  Sweden. 

Volvo trucks productions is handled by Volvo Group which is not owned by Geely, but is its own company. Geely only owns Volvo Cars and not Volvo Group that make the Volvo trucks, buses and what not. The factory producing Volvo cars is separate from the one that makes the trucks as they are separate entities. Volvo Group has more employees than Volvo Cars in Sweden too. Sure Sweden cannot alone meet global demand but China isnt exactly the only other country on the planet where you can have a profitable car manufacturing plant with a good workforce to make the plant go around. 

&gt; None of these countries, with the possible exception of South Korea, can  offer the same economy of scale as Chinese production. Point being, you  can phone your Chinese supplier and get them to scale up production by  200% overnight. Or scale it back a bit if needed. Few nations, if any,  can offer production flexibility like that.  While labour costs are  rising in China, as in any developing economy, the costs are still  vastly cheaper than a country like Japan. Chinese salaries are still  lightyears behind their Japanese or Korean contemporaries. 

Taiwan, South Korea and Japan already compete at the scale of China. At the moment the largest semiconductor factory in the world is in S. Korea, and they're have another one that will be the 3rd biggest in the world when it's finished. 7th largest in world is a plant in Japan, 8th largest in world is in Taiwan, 10th largest in world in Singapore (I didnt mention them before, I forgot them), 11th largest is in Japan, 12th and 13th largest are in Taiwan and on it goes with lots of Taiwanese plants and even a plant in Malaysia made it to the top 25 in the world. Scaling these production over their limit isn't possible which is why there is often shortages of processors for phones and computers of specific brands. The yield has to be high to be profitable which you can see now with Nvidia with their new 3000 series decided to go with Samsung instead of TSMC because the yield is way higher with Samsung and thus more profitable which decrease the cost for consumers too because the chance of a good and functioning processor is higher at Samsung so they dont have to pay for wasted ones. 

&gt; Geely doesn't want to shut down Volvo Cars. Volvo Cars have been  knocking it out of the park since Geely took over. Geely have been  investing heavily in Gothenburg. Same goes with NEVS in Trollhättan.  This is not a GM situation where you have a distinterested owner who  just wants to offload. The only way you can ""get back"" Volvo Cars right  now would be to illegally expropiate the business. Which would instantly  make Sweden an economic pariah. 

But they're planning to merge with it and have been previously said they'd have to pull out from Sweden which means we'd lose a huge employer and the local ability to produce cars and emergency vehicles such as police cars and ambulances disappears if they ever decide to do it and it's always in these cases that the Swedish government stepped in and either bought up the company themselves or asked another company to buy the company in question on behalf of the Swedish government. 

They've asked Saab AB to buy Thyssen Krupp Marine System AB previously named Kockums that was sold from Celsius AB a company owned by the Swedish state at the time before that was sold to Saab AB and the company got split-up. Kockums got german owners. It was later bought by Saab AB on the behalf of the Swedish government because Kockums were in danger of getting shut down by their German owners because their submarines competed against their other German made submarines. Sweden would have lost its ability to produce its own submarines if they had shut it down, but the government stepped in and asked Saab to buy it in 2014.

The only thing we can do to make it stay if it ever decides to move away, except buying it up or something is to make it extremely hard for them to fire the employees of Volvo Cars in Sweden, after all LAS applies to all Swedish employers and they have to abide by those laws. Although Volvo themselves haven't really been dependent on Geely to survive, it was more that Ford was mismanaging them to death and with Geely they got more freedom to do what they used to focus on and what not. Well I guess access to the Chinese market did help a bit, seeing as the market for Volvo cars is the biggest in China and Sweden is on 2nd place.",Kungariket Sverige,/r/europe/comments/in82hr/europe_just_declared_independence_from_china/g48h7tv/,weirdowerdo,1599403961

In Mozart's time, Salzburg was the capital of an ecclesiastical principality ruled by an archbishop, the composer's father came from Augsburg, Germany, and his mother from St. Gilgen. Additionally, unambiguous identification is influenced by the circle of culture and language, where even theater was divided into German and Italian. A separate national consciousness of the Austrians was formed much later. It can be assumed that Mozart throughout his life was associated with the territories and culture of Austria, although the location of Salzburg also resulted in natural Bavarian influences. The German term reflects the historical conditions to a large extent, but it would have to apply equally to all of Mozart's contemporary Germanic inhabitants of the Habsburg monarchy.*",Mazovia (Poland),/r/europe/comments/inj76h/mozarts_nationality_according_to_local_wikipedia/g48hb8z/,Zacny_Los,1599404016

The fact that the idea of nations and nation states is modern is widely accepted by historians. 

&gt; The concept of a nation-state is notoriously difficult to define. A working and imprecise definition
is: a type of state that conjoins the political entity of a state to the cultural entity of a nation, from which it aims to derive its political legitimacy to rule and potentially its status as a sovereign state.

This is a distinctly modern idea.

3562,"&gt;Vajdahunyad vára was builted by hungarian peoples. 

Vajdahunyad was ""built"" by a guy who was a member of the nobility of the Kingdom of Hungary.  
In the sense that the guy paid the workers.

The ethnic origins of the Hunyadi family are extremely unclear, you are either ignorant or extremely deluded if you think you can make a clear case for them being ""hungarian people"".  
On top of the whole thing the area they ruled over was VERY far from being majority populated by ""hungarian people"".

Hell even some poor ottoman prisoners of war worked on building a well there.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I am a Hungarian people and I know the ""achievements"" of the Hungarians. 

...well lets shred the ""list of achievement""

* The ballpoint pen was invented aka. the pen gained its final form at the hand of a hungarian inventor.
* Matchstick have been around for a few millenia by the time János Irinyi invented them - originated from china if legends are true - and have been developed further since then
* Oszkár Asbóth ""the hungarian inventor of helicopter"" created something with rotary wings. That was able to lift of when tethered to something to ensure its stability.  
Aka. it was unable to fly in the air on its own, without the help of 4 guys on the ground dragging it with ropes to help it move.
* Despite a few hungarians working as assistants (among many) for the Alexander Graham Bell, he was not in fact a hungarian.  
Maybe that has something to do with the fact that the first telephones had to be imported into Hungary.
* Von Neumann was not the first guy, nor the last, nor the most important who worked in the field of ""cybernetics"" as it was called back then.
* And lets not get even started on the Manhattan project.  
While SOME hungarians worked on it, it was not mainly manned by hungarians, nor financed by Hungary, or anything remotely like that.

Frankly in my personal experience the ""hungarians invented everything"" is popular with its crowd, as ""i am from the same ethnicity as those big names"" is the most they achieved in life, and the most they are willing to strive for.",,/r/europe/comments/inie99/help_me_identify_these_buildings_theyre_in/g485ugf/,Xicadarksoul,1599396427

3589,"Serious answer: Flevoland is the youngest Dutch province, having been created by poldering a part of the Ijsselmeer. At the time of its creation, the Dutch government had an ambitious project to create an ideal society by directing its construction from the ground up.  Civil servants decided which elements of the population could move to the new territory, and which jobs they could hold. For obvious reasons, this didn't work out. The policy had been abandonned by the time of the creation of the cities of Almere and Lelystad. 

Due to the province's cities being relatively new, and having mostly been built in the 70s and 80s, a lot of the local architecture is pretty cheap and drab by modern standards. Additionally, Flevoland lacks a strong regional identity, especially compared to other Dutch provinces, some of which being centuries old. There are no real cultural centres in the region either; the urban areas in the west are essentially suburbs of Amsterdam, and the rest is thinly populated farmland. 

Honorary mention: the exception to this rule is the town of Urk, a fishing village which used to be an island and is now on Flevoland's coast. Urk has a (not-undeserving) reputation for being very socially conservative, having an insular mentality, and being much more religious than the national average. Urk also has a (less deserving) reputation from being incestuous. Due to centuries of close familial ties, Urkers have a higher chance of developping certain genetic disorders. Buchem's disease is a rare genetic condition only found in Urk.

3837,"Thanks. I totally agree with your assessment. 

One weak spot is in fact the European dependency on gas required to heat homes and NS2 is meant to replace gas from NL. 

I'm still trying to find sources to figure how many households would be forced to upgrade their heaters for compatibility to shit like American LNG. And how long that would take. Or how many not yet existing gas tankers it would take.

On the other hand, our governments are restricted by constitutional clauses to the rule of law. If you want to deny corporations an allowance to import gas, you would need a valid reason and be ready to pay massive compensation orders. And have citizens' gas bills going through the roof ... and loose the next election.

At the end of the 19th century Genoa was the main financial centre of Italy along with Milan, and Piazza De Ferrari was the place where many institutions were established, like the stock exchange, the Credito Italiano, the branch offices of the Bank of Italy, founded in 1893.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/inft9d/piazza_de_ferrari_genova_italy/g47bh7e/,filosoful,1599366637

Settling right on the water would mean the town would be effectively indefensible against nighttime raids.

Look at Athens.  The old city center is inland.  The port city was Piraeus.

Rome, once again inland. Portus was its port.

While being right on the water would provide defense in the case of a siege via the land, it provided a liability for raiding.

Once coasts became safer and more defensible, cities started building right on them.  But before that, you’d rather be on a hill for sure!",,/r/europe/comments/in5wk3/monemvasia_greece/g46rjfk/,Apptubrutae,1599353782

The only reason we got to hold one in 2012 was because we signed an agreement with the UK government called “Section 30” which temporarily gave us the power to hold one. We would need to get the UK to agree to another order, otherwise if we went ahead and had one without the UK’s “consent”, the ruling if turned in  favour of independence could be boycotted or blocked in the Supreme Court because it’s not technically legally binding. Sturgeon and the SNP are pushing to have another one before May 2021 but we would essentially need Boris’s consent to do so, and he’s said in interviews that he wouldn’t give his consent.

So the notion of ""Croats killing everyone in his village"" is just fucking apsurd. Besides, you might want to mention that the people doing these killings were Nazi collaborators during WW2 and not just random Croats that felt genocidal.

Besides, the Croatian wikipedia (it's shit btw - just like most non-english ones) states ""**Nikola Tesla** ([Smiljan](https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiljan), [10. srpnja](https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/10._srpnja) [1856.](https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/1856.) \- [New York](https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York), [7. siječnja](https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/7._sije%C4%8Dnja) [1943.](https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/1943.)) bio je hrvatski i američki elektroinženjer i [izumitelj](https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izumitelj) podrijetlom [Srbin](https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srbi_u_Hrvatskoj) iz Hrvatske "" which roughly translates into ""Nikola tesla was a croatian-american.... and by birth a Croatian Serb"".

So I don't see what's wrong there? Was he born in what is now (and was for centuries before Tesla's birth) Croatia? Yes. Did he spend most of his life and did most of his work in the US? Yes. Was he ethnically a Serb? Yes.

No, that's the left. The democrats in America for example are straight up pushing for a race war and would rather see their own country burn than lose the next election. Facts don't matter to them, only the narrative.

They take scenes out of context and frame them as police brutality and hate crime all the time. Media runs with it for a few days, then eventually the full picture is revealed and turns out the police was in the right. But by that time they are already pushing their next lie and no one cares about the previous story. The narrative and unrest must be maintained. Reddit is a prime example, frontpage is hardcore leftist brainwashing these days. 

&gt; So what's the progress you hate?

Self proclaimed radical thugs and communists given a free pass by the leftist media and American celebrities, young kids undergoing gender reassignment and ruining their lives because it's the latest progressive craze among idiotic parents, criminals and looters being painted as heroes, people can lose their job and get cancelled for having an opinion that goes against the left/liberals, amazing progress really.

4267,"Oh I don't care about cultural appropriation just in central Europe life is fun. And lawyers only make our life harder, legal terms are often misleading. For me (us in central Europe) nationality mostly means that you belong to a nation. It doesn't have to be your country, you don't have to own a citizenship, but you feel that culturally you are part of this community and others accept this.

E.g. I have a friend born in Romania (Romanian citizen, part of Romanian nation? Never felt so.), who is ethnic German (became German citizen as Volksdeutsche, part of German nation? Maybe.) and his native language is Hungarian (besides German) so he is recognized as part of the Hungarian nation (today also citizen of Hungary and lives in Hungary). So what is his nationality? :-)

For most Western Europeans these are less important questions but they can cause troubles. And we often feel that the law and regulations of some Western European countries are poor since they are not prepared for cases like these.

My favorite was when some Britons wanted to make personal IDs nationwide. So discussion started.
Based on some EU law the cards are standardized and contain the field ""Nationality"".
But what to write into this field in Northern Ireland?
They didn't accept the term: British, as they are not British just the citizens of the ""United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"". (Which contains four nations: English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish.)
But they couldn't write Irish as they are not citizens of the Republic of Ireland. (Even when they are part of the Irish nation.)
If the field contained citizenship they could use: Citizen of the UK. Problem solved.
This example shows these problems exist in Western Europe too.

Late Saturday evening, reports  came out through local media that the police were actively looking for  rioters in the city center of Groningen. No arrests have been made yet.

“This  goes beyond all limits”, says a spokesman for the municipality about  the violence in the city, after RTV Noord reported about it earlier  tonight.

## Chairs and tables

Images shared via social media  show how dozens of men pelt each other with everything that is loose and  stuck. The chairs and tables fly back and forth.

Groningen already feared riots. An emergency order is in force in the  city for fear of disturbances. There were indications that German  hooligans were coming to town. With such an emergency order, the  municipality can bring people outside the municipal boundary.

However Talabuga, who led the main army in Northern Hungary, was stopped by the heavy snow of the [Carpathians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpathian_Mountains) and the invading force was defeated[\[81\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Europe#cite_note-81) near [Pest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest,_Hungary) by the royal army of [Ladislaus IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladislaus_IV_of_Hungary) and ambushed by the [Székely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sz%C3%A9kely) in the return. Nogai's own column suffered serious casualties. As with later invasions, it was repelled handily, the Mongols losing much of their invading force. The outcome could not have contrasted more sharply with the 1241 invasion, mostly due to the reforms of [Béla IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_IV_of_Hungary), which included advances in military tactics and, most importantly, the widespread building of stone [castles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle), both responses to the defeat of the Hungarian Kingdom in 1241. The failed Mongol attack on Hungary greatly reduced the Golden Horde's military power and caused them to stop disputing Hungarian borders.[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Europe#cite_note-Victor_Spinei_1986._Pages_121-122-75)[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Europe#cite_note-82)

Targetting the launch platform itself is the best bet, it's barely feasible to target radar sights themselves.

Ground hugging which would allow aircraft to aproach within 20-25km uses Terrain following radar, which is rather easily detectable from beyond the horizon, and once radar knows where to look, it doesn't matter if the target is below the horizon...

Thats the geological term, it is also 100% irrelevent. The legal term is what matters here and it makes no distinction between mainland and islands regarding the continental shelf.

&gt; and do you have any map on that? 

Sure,if you are having trouble reading and need pictures to understand the here:

 [Marine Regions · Greek Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)](https://www.marineregions.org/gazetteer.php?p=details&amp;id=5679)  

&gt; no, I am not. we already teared that apart. we have Treaty of Lausanne.  now they are trying to impose seville map just like sevres which we will  tear apart as well. that's turkish customs to tear apart western  imposed maps. 

On the contrary, turkey trying to impose mavi vatan ton greece is like a treaty of sevres against greece. It will also have the same fate.

&gt; Turkish government sources have indicated that islands such as Pserimos, Agathonisi, Fournoi and Gavdos 

Lmao, why stop there? Its clear that those claims are baseless so why stop at 3 islands? Do you even know where gavdos is?

Anyways these isands have had a greek population for thousands of years and where given to greece by italy, they are not turkish, sorry to burst your bubble.

&gt; no they can't. these islands has demilitarisation status accurding to  agreements greece signed. you can see the map of those here:   
&gt;  
&gt; you can paint pink as much as you like. that's infringement of the agreement. 

Greece is 1000% permited to militarise those islands.

1. Per article 51of the UN. 
2. Greece signed the paris treaty with Italy, turkey didnt even have a deligation in paris at the time. Since turkey isnt a party in the treaty, it has no legal basis to complain.

As long as turkey maintain:

1. An occupation in cyprus
2. A causus beli on greece
3. An offensive army in the agean with the purpose of taking over greek islands.

Greece is fully within its rights to claim self deffence and militarise those islands\\

&gt; yeah, they put their country in middle of western army bases, what a shame on them being agressive like that. 

Turkey is on of the most imperialistic countries on earth. It currently occupies territory in three neigbouring countries.

Claims greek territory and tries to enforce a sevre treaty on greece(mavi vatan)

Violates greek  and cypriot sovereign rights by doing research and drilling on their EEZ and continental shelves.

Violates greek airspace and territorial waters

Turkey is 100% the agressor here. There is no legal or moral justification for its deplorable actions.

&gt; 50th time, you have not offically told or gave any border map to turkish  side. send turks a diplomatic note, if it is. you always stay away from  offical measurements, and playing to crowds. 

Greece has made perfectly clear via the law the hellenic parliament passed of what it considers to be her EEZ and continental shelf. Greece desnt have to publish a map and spoon feed it to the tukish government as if its a three year old. The law is enough since the map is draw automaticaly. If you want to see what the map looks like its here  [Marine Regions · Greek Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)](https://www.marineregions.org/gazetteer.php?p=details&amp;id=5679)  

&gt; you are in the islands that ottomans owned, and you don't have a treaty says those islands are given to you. 

Wrong, and wrong

We are in islands that were **owned by the italians** and we **do have traty that says they belong to us.**

&gt; noone, in turkey wants a war unless turkey is attacked.

what being religious really means.

And it could be less depending on the terrain, which often offers more cover. So a 400 km range on a missile doesn't really mean that much.

Then, as large SAM systems are not too mobile, they can also be attacked with cruise missiles, or antirradiation missiles in the case of mobile systems. These can be launched in large numbers and, given that they'll only appear in the enemy radar in the last minute or two before impact, they can overwhelm the enemy's defenses.",Asturias (Spain),/r/europe/comments/imxaja/tank_graveyard_in_russia/g44ok4c/,DecentlySizedPotato,1599317536

4900,"&gt; Maritime power=|=big navy.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Russia has a bigger navy than Britain but by all account, Britain is a maritime power and Russia is a land power. China’s navy is probably the second biggest- but it is not a maritime power. This is why China tries so hard to get South China Sea in its side. Anything outside and it can be easily boxed in by foreign in powers. 

However you look at maritime power China certainly has it.     


&gt;Taiwan recognization means dereconizing China. Same is not true for Kosovo. Taiwan doesn’t need UN seat because it will NEVER get it. As both countries make others choose which nation to recognize (you can recognize Kosovo and Serbia but not China and Taiwan). So for them it’s about pride.     

Yeah  I didn't quite know about that. And apparently it's 15 countries that only recognise Taiwan but not China as weird as that choice is for them.  But that makes their relations even more complicated than Serbia-Kosovo.  To the extent China and Taiwan have a better relationship I reckon that's because Taiwan has existed independently for much longer than Kosovo giving time for relations to normalise and develop.   Trade between Serbia and Kosovo is not insignificant either. In fact before Kosovo's 100% tariffs Serbia exported much more goods to it than to China.   


&gt;If tomorrow 2 countries let go of their pride and forego the one China policy- literaly no country but China, and DPRK would stop to recognize Taiwan. Taiwan has not declared independence and it still has like 5-10 nations recognizing it with 150 others informally doing bussiness.    


I agree with that. Well maybe you could say Taiwan  values or needs mass recognition less than  Kosovo. But practically I would still say they benefit more from China's recognition than Kosovo  does from Serbia's. Kosovo only needs that for EU membership for which they're not ready anyways. I'm pretty sure in 30 years or less even Spain and Romania would recognise Kosovo if it's ready for EU accession. And again what Taiwan proves is you can survive and thrive  without being recognised.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/imjbtl/serbia_and_kosovo_agree_to_normalise_economic_ties/g43m1a0/,ZmeiOtPirin,1599295186

5003,"Yeah as the Latvian guy said about Baltics, Estonia has also been testing at the same rate, technically even more now as when someone gets infected all contacts also get tests.

Besides that we have started testing the waterworks for covid signs and have 'walk-in' testing booths in certain areas (not sure about how many but one close to me was advertised on the radio so obviously I remembered that one).

We have a couple of ""how the hell did he get it?"" cases but most are localised. Some industry workers went to party, some foreign students flew in etc.

Personally I talked to my family doctor and went for a test during the first wave because I was feeling a little bit strange but it was ok - meaning if I with a hunch got a test I would think others who are just ""feeling strange"" would also be able to go for a test.

It is a luck thing though, our second wave so far is quite, whats the word, shallow? Constantly \~15 - 20'ish people a day or so. I would think if we can manage to keep it at that after 2 weeks it should go down to before which was like 0-8 cases per day. Last 24h had 15 infections.

If it goes up then localised quaranteen areas are probably going to put in place. We have already seen schools who had students test positive locking down again and going the e-study route.

We also have a quite ok'ish site for Estonian statistics. All in all we have done 156 271 tests, 153 815 have been negative. 2 456 total have been positive. In the second wave most who got covid positive have been largely male for some reason.

Every state sometimes managed by (how can I describe this without harm anyone) inefficient people. Current politicians are not the context of the this topic. This topic is about what happened.

&gt; Mass deportations of an entire ethnic group is considered a genocidal crime.

Some historians doesn't agree with this argument.

&gt; Syrian desert

Desert? Deir ez-Zor is not desert. It was very furtile land (and maybe still it is I don't know).

&gt; Eye witness accounts

History methodology consider eye witness accounts but after the recorded sources.

&gt; German military sources

This is the difference. Holocaust cannot be deniable because there is written evidence (Nazi orders). Countries/states do everything with written orders and nothing is gonna lost from the archives. There is always record.

&gt;  that I grew up with confirm that what has been done to the Armenians 

Funny thing is that if you listen (you don't probably?) Turkish people in the region about what Hunchakians do to them, do you said Armenians do genocide? (There are many pictures that Armenian **rebels** (rebels, not the Armenian citizens of the Ottoman Empire. There are huge difference between them) killed Turkish **babies**.

&gt; According to Wikileaks, Turkish state is purging the archives for documents related to Armenian Genocide.

Wow. Turkish government many times proposing to open archives with many neutral historians and Armenia don't accept this purpose. Why?

&gt; I'm an evil Kurdish half-breed that is colliding with the Jews and the English.

Funny thing is that I'm half Kurdish (I'm sure about this part) but there is a chance that my great uncle can be an Armenian (I'm not sure about this. But there are hints about it).

5076,"Translation:

**Warsaw**: Hello, Nick. Good day to you. How are you?

**Berlin**: Everything is going according to plan... Navalny materials are ready. Sending it to the Chancellor's office. Waiting for her press-release.

**Warsaw**: Is the [Navalny] poisoning confirmed?

**Berlin**: Listen... Mike... It's not relevant. It's war. War requires all methods.

**Warsaw**: I agree! We need to snub Putin out of Belarus' affairs. This is the most effective way - to drown him in internal Russian problems! Moreover, it's their regional election day soon.

**Berlin**: That is exactly what we are doing. How are your affairs in Belarus?

**Warsaw**: Not good, to be honest. President Lukashenko is a tough nut. They are professional and organized. Surely, Russia supports them. Officials and military are loyal to the president. The rest I'll tell when we meet, not on the phone.

**Berlin**: I understand. See you soon, bye.

**Warsaw**: Bye.

Context:

Couple days ago Lukashenko mentioned an intercepted communications between Poland and Germany talking about how everything about Navalny was fabricated and that the protests in Belarus is simply German special operation.

This has been published in a Telegram channel allegedly controlled by Belarussian authorities. Seems reliable, as they have a history of having the most relevant and fresh information from Belarussian government.

Ataturk ""ideals"" even since the 50's but mostly after the 70's are being used as a nationalistic blanket to cover every idiotic Turkish doctrine of foreign policy, like it's a plan inherited by Ataturk himself.

I will give a real world example. Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974. Let's assume for the shake of argument that this was done to protect the lives of Turkish Cypriots.
I would bet my house that if Ataturk was alive, would use an end of North Cyprus occupation as a negotiation tool towards Turkey's accession to EU. And he would have done this much earlier than Cyprus joined EU. I don't say that this was the only obstacle that Turkey had to join EU, but I am sure Ataturk would fight successfully on all the other fronts to achieve this goal.

I think my assumption is very likely to be true, when we are talking about a man that by force changed the alphabet of a nation from arabic to latin characters. Ataturk was facing towards the West.",,/r/europe/comments/imlnsp/statue_of_ataturk_and_the_soldiers/g4314no/,delibaltas,1599281288

It is a moral issue on whether wiping out an entire ethnic group either through massacres, or as the commenter above me would like to believe, a peaceful death march into the Syrian desert, is justifiable.

Mass deportations of an entire ethnic group is considered a genocidal crime. Not to mention, a fuck ton of Armenians never even reached the Syrian border. Call it a murder orgy, organized murder spree, the Purge, Nazi Germany: The Prequel, etc. Eye witness accounts, testimonies of the survivors, German military sources, etc. too many unconnected sources including the horror stories told in Eastern Turkey that I grew up with confirm that what has been done to the Armenians can only be described as a Genocide.

&gt; For much of the High Middle Ages, France was a highly decentralized feudal kingdom in which the authority of the king was barely felt. King Philip Augustus achieved remarkable success in the strengthening of royal power and the expansion of his realm, doubling its size and defeating his rivals. By the end of his reign, France had emerged as the most powerful state in Europe.[11] In the mid-14th century, French monarchs were embroiled in a series of dynastic conflicts with their English counterparts, which lasted over 100 years. Emerging victorious from said conflicts, disputes with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire soon followed during the Renaissance but were ultimately less successful. However, French culture flourished and a global colonial empire was established, which by the 20th century would become the second largest in the world.[12] The second half of the 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots), which severely weakened the country. But France once again emerged as Europe's dominant cultural, political, and military power in the 17th century under Louis XIV following the Thirty Years' War.[13] An inadequate financial model and inequitable taxation system as well as endless and costly wars to maintain its predominant position, the Seven Years' War and American War of Independence among them, left the heavily indebted kingdom in a precarious situation by the end of the 18th century. The French Revolution in 1789 saw the fall of the absolute monarchy that characterized the Ancien Régime and from its ashes, rose one of modern history's earliest republics, which drafted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The declaration expresses the nation's ideals to this day.

&gt; Following the revolution, France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating much of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of European and world history. After the collapse of the empire and a relative decline, France endured a tumultuous succession of governments culminating in the establishment of the French Third Republic in 1870 in the midst of the Franco-Prussian War. France was one of the prominent participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious, and was one of the Allied powers in World War II, but came under occupation by the Axis in 1940. Following liberation in 1944, a Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War. The Fifth Republic, led by Charles de Gaulle, was formed in 1958 and remains to this day. Algeria and nearly all other French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with most retaining close economic and military connections with France.

Hmmmm..... France basically spent 4 eras as the most powerful state in Europe (1214 to 1337, 1453 to 1515, 1648 to 1756 and finally 1797 to 1812)....

NATO: Turkey, Greece agree to talks about tensions at sea
* 		By SUZAN FRASER and MENELAOS HADJICOSTIS Associated Press Sep 3, 2020 


ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — The chief of NATO said Thursday that Greece and Turkey have agreed to start “technical talks” aimed at helping to reduce the risks of military incidents and accidents in the eastern Mediterranean, where the allies have been locked in a tense standoff over offshore energy rights.
But an official in Athens quickly denied any such agreement, saying Turkey must first withdraw its warships from the area where it’s carrying out research.
There was no immediate reaction from Ankara.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced the possible diplomatic opening in a statement on the military alliance's website the same day that Turkey announced that Russia plans to conduct live-fire naval exercises this month in the eastern Mediterranean .
“Greece and Turkey are valued Allies, and NATO is an important platform for consultations on all issues that affect our shared security,” the statement read. “I remain in close touch with all concerned Allies to find a solution to the tensions in the spirit of NATO solidarity.”
A Greek official told The Associated Press that talk of an agreement “does not not correspond with reality.”
""In any case, we have noted the NATO Secretary-General’s intention to work to create mechanisms for de-escalation within the framework of NATO,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to comment on the record.
“Nevertheless, de-escalation would only be achieved with the immediate withdrawal of all Turkish ships from the Greek continental shelf,”he said.
Turkey announced the Russian exercises in a navigational notice that said they would take place Sept. 8-22 and Sept. 17-25 in areas of the Mediterranean Sea where Turkish research vessels are doing seismic work for oil and gas exploration. Greece says the disputed area is over its continental shelf.
There was no immediate comment from Moscow on the exercises, which Turkey announced after the United States said it was partially lifting a 33-year-old arms embargo against ethnically divided Cyprus. Like Greece, Cyprus has been in a dispute with Turkey over drilling rights in the Mediterranean.
In Athens, Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas said the planned Russian exercises were being “monitored by all the countries in the region, as well as our NATO allies and European Union partners.”
It's unclear why NATO-member Turkey announced such drills on Russia's behalf, but the two countries have in recent years significantly strengthened their military, political and economic ties. They are coordinating closely on their military presence in Syria, while Turkey has purchased Russia's advanced S-400 missiles and has broken ground on a Russian-built nuclear power plant on its southern coast.
Cyprus government spokesman Kyriakos Koushos said that Russia notifies Cypriot authorities directly about navigation notices. He said Cyprus has no issue with Russia and that its only complaint concerns Turkey’s attempts to “take advantage” of the situation.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke by phone on Thursday. Germany currently holds the European Union’s rotating presidency and has been trying to informally mediate the dispute over drilling in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.
A statement from Erdogan’s office said the Turkish leader wants an arrangement in which resources are shared “fairly” and complained that Greece, Greek Cypriots and countries backing the two were the ones escalating tensions.",,/r/europe/comments/imou26/nato_turkey_greece_agree_to_talks_about_tensions/g434x92/,falconsflyfast,1599283805

Im paraphrasing but when your own ""elected"" leader says in a speech to his people in Smyrna a year ago that ""we made Greeks swim here and we ll do it again"" i really dont know what else is there to be said apart from shame.

Turkey has a population of 80 million people

Just like the US this is a society that literally hates eachother more than any perceived enemy at this point thanks to 20 years of populism and polarization. 

of course you are going to see more nutjobs when compared with other countries and unlike many european coutnries turkey never suffered from the horrors of WW2 so that old fashioned jingoism is still prevalent in the population since they havent suffered from a real war after WW1. 

WW1 also left a huge trauma on Turkish people and because of the way we approached ""peace treaties"" after ww1 turkey had to fight to its last breath and this created permanent a prevalent xenophobia and distrust against the victors of WW1 and years of incompetent politicians further cemented those fears to get more votes.

&gt;""we made Greeks swim here and we ll do it again"" 

this is like one of the oldest memes in turkey, there were actual protests in the past against removing WW1 re-enactments that kept antagonizing greeks for future generations

I even remember watching a turkish comedy show about student life that took a jab at this issue, it was basically like two groups of kids hated each-other, the school chairman wanted to do the re-enactment to impress government officials while the teachers were protesting it. In the end ""the heroes"" of the show played the greek side and took things seriously and beated the crap out of the ""villians"" who were playing as the turks in front of state officials who protested the thing and left much to the embarrassment of the school chairman. 

for a more popular and more used meme there is ""pushing it into greece"" which is more in line with I see with other european countries. basically if any turkish celebrity or tv person does something that makes people cringe the turkish users will start posting comments like ""nice greek celebrity"". when I asked about the the reply I got was fascinating ""greeks keep stealing out food which is the only positive and enjoyable thing we have left so it is only fair for us to push our cringe content their way. they cannot get away just with claiming good stuff""

So yes, as an academic that studies the region I have a lot of hope for the future since the younger generations are much better when compared with boomers on both sides. 

&gt;Oh goodness so its not just me seeing all instanbul related pics get hot instantly eh. Thats why i supported the idea that TR sub spams upvotes on everything theirs.

I think there is also a sociological reason behind this that needs to be researched. my turkish friends basically say that ""cats stories are the only positive coverage our nation gets with international media these days""

we can clearly observe an air of hopelessness, apathy and loss off identity in this new generation. much can be blamed on mobility since some of them have never seen what life outside of turkeys borders looks like (much like the conservative rednecks in any other nation), in fact you see even less off these people since they cannot speak english thanks to their education system. 

also people should learn to dismiss any kind of speeches coming from erdogan just like trump. he openly designated half of his population as terrorists just a year ago, he basically hates 40 million people living inside his own country, do you really expect any diplomatic courtesy from a tyrant such as this?

yet the majority of the turks in every single metropolitan city voted against him even under these circumstances. lets just not forget that he cancelled the local elections in istanbul when he lost and called for a new election and than proceeded to lose that one with an even bigger margin. during the campaign erdogans party members constantly attacked the new mayor for being ""secretly greek"" (they even called him out for wearing a blue tie instead of a red tie) because he was born in the pontic region yet people embraced him nonetheless.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/imlnsp/statue_of_ataturk_and_the_soldiers/g42r4jl/,LadyLaurelin,1599274440

his european counterparts at that time constantly donned on military uniforms even though non of them were career soldiers, fascism was on the ride and was even taking root in sciences. 

ataturk who came into power as a generalissimo who was a fairly successful military commander on multiple front opted to never wear the military uniform again and preferred to be represented in civilian clothes.

the right wing military junta of the 80's tried to constantly use his image for legitimacy and fighting communism. most of the statues of him in turkey dated back to this era as if the military was mass producing statues on a large scale. the main feature of these statues was their lack of quality and fascist imagery that was trying to put on a display of strength. they also used his rare images in modern military uniform a lot even though we almost never find him appearing in public in this uniform.

5297,"One of the greatest political minds of the 20th century. 

&gt; “To my understanding, just as it happened yesterday, the future of Europe will be dependent upon Germany. That nation is dynamic and disciplined. If Germany unites, it will seek to shake off the yoke of the Versailles Treaty. Germany, Russia, and England will have a strong army to conquer Europe. The next war will come from 1940 to 1945. France has lost the spirit of creating a powerful army, and therefore, England will not depend upon France to protect herself. France will no longer be a buffer state. Italy will improve, somewhat, under Mussolini. He will first try to avoid war, if he can. But I fear that he will try to play the role of Caesar and it will prove to the World that Italy cannot produce a powerful army yet. America will not be able to avoid war and Germany will be defeated only through her interference. If authorities in Europe do not get together on the basis of controversies of political contacts and try to placate their own hatreds and interests, it will be tragic. “The victorious power after the war between 1940 and 1945 will not be England, France, or Germany, but Bolshevism. Being closest to Russia and having had many wars with her in the past, Turkey is watching Russia closely and sees the whole danger developing. Russia knows how to influence and awaken the minds of Eastern countries, and how to give them ideas of nationalism. Russia has encouraged hatred towards the West. Bolshevism is getting to be a power and a great threat to Europe and Asia.”

Not once did I suggest ANY common system of shared European values.

What other European countries take from our history to portray themselves as relevant during ancient times is out of our control. This is cultural appropriation, but I guess this term is only relevant on twitter now, applicable only for white people who wear dreadlocks or Bantu knots.  

Furthermore, the concept of white supremacy is not something we find applicable to us. We do not share any common brotherhood or camaraderie with ANY European country. 

Greeks experienced:

Persian attempts of occupation 
Roman colonization 
Pillaging by Crusaders
Ottoman Occupation 
Greek Genocide in modern Turkey. 
WW2 Italian invasion attempt
WW2 Brutal Nazi occupation 
Winston Churchill instigating a civil war in Greece
America supported Military Junta
Istanbul Pogrom


This is just the major events. As you can see, we have faced invasion, theft, slavery, occupation, loss of sovereignty, political interference comparable to any other people on earth. But yes, call us racist because we are a shade of white. 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣


The difference is , we don’t strategize victimizing ourselves like other groups to achieve some type of abstract “equity” stake. We have always fought back, which is something others groups who claim racism at every opportunity can not claim. It is our history and stories of valour which give us this strength. 

We read our history and find stories of heroism against all odds. Others read their history and find stories of either being slaves or taking slaves as their claim to fame. This is the difference. 

You see the world as either racist or victim of said racist.

5359,"Open your eyes wide and read word for word carefully:

&gt; The political-level representatives of **France, the Russian Federation, and the United States**, as Co-Chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group dealing with the Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) conflict, jointly proposed a set of basic principles for the peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) conflict to the sides in November 2007 on the margins of the OSCE Ministerial Council in Madrid. These basic principles are founded on the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act, including those related to refraining from the threat or use of force, the territorial integrity of the states, and the equal rights and self-determination of peoples. **The proposal transmitted to the sides in Madrid comprises a balanced package of principles that are currently under negotiation**. ***The sides have agreed that no single element is agreed until all elements are agreed by the parties.***

&gt; **Unfortunately, this draft resolution selectively propagates only certain of these principles to the exclusion of others, without considering the Co-Chairs' proposal in its balanced entirety.**

&gt; **Because of this selective approach**, the three OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chair countries must **oppose this unilateral draft resolution**. They reiterate that a peaceful, equitable, and lasting settlement of the NK conflict will ***require unavoidable compromises among the parties*** that reflect the principles of territorial integrity, non-use of force, and equal rights of peoples, as well as other principles of international law.

https://www.osce.org/mg/49564

Let me quote you the select lines separately: 

- ***The sides have agreed that no single element is agreed until all elements are agreed by the parties.*** &lt;--- notice the words **agreed** repeated twice.

- ***require unavoidable compromises among the parties***

Wonder what the unavoidable compromises are for Azerbaijan!?

It cannot get any more factual than that. 

Karabakhi Armenians have been living in Nagorno Karabakh in majority **for a long time*** since even before Azerbaijan because a state in 1918! Nagorno Karabakh was **an official region with official borders with official self-rule with official autonomy since 1923**. Operation Ring was the ethnic cleansing of this people from their homeland and later the revocation of its autonomy against their will, all of which were acts against the agreement the USSR had with the west: Helsinki Final Act. Do you finally understand?

Sure, Azerbaijan has to agree to apply self-determination to Nagorno Karabakh. But it has no choice but to agree because of it is party to the Helsinki Final Act. Understood?

Precisely, because the local Armenian forces were not an official State entity, they are not mentioned in any of the resolutions as an entity and instead they are referred to as I repeat:

- Res 822 Preamble: ... Kelbadjar district of the **Republic of Azerbaijan by local Armenian forces** ...

- Res 853 clause 9: ... **Armenians of the Nagorny-Karabakh region** ...

- Res 884 clause 2: ... the **Armenians of the Nagorny Karabakh region** ...

... and **Armenian forces** in the UN General Assembly resolution **while in reference to the UN Security Council resolutions**

That's how they should refer to an unrecognised entity or a people who rose up, and that's exactly what they do. You are providing arguments against the wrong conclusions you yourself are drawing. If they were to refer to Armed Forces of the Republic of Armenia they sure as hell would say that. They don't as you can clearly see. **Forces** doesn't have any allusion to anything official which is why it is a legal term to use in such circumstances. 

Why don't you defend the rights of people to not suffer under USSR and regimes just like the USSR? What is it that makes you only want to defend a petro-dictator which makes Azerbaijani people suffer under USSR-like conditions? That is not even a question of being in a rule-based order which you clearly are against, but at least from a moral perspective you would not defend a conflict perpetuated because a dictator pounding a country?

Nagorno Karabakh seeking self determination outside of Azerbaijan is not theft of Nagorno Karabakh. That does not even make sense. In fact Azerbaijan cleansing the historic population of Nagorno Karabakh purely because of territorial reasons is an actual theft not to mention a crime against humanity. Why do you only focus on territory and not human rights?

Look at all the protests all over the world to throw down corrupt authoritarian regimes everywhere, specially in countries with a post-Soviet regime, the USSR fell, but the regimes didn't! The self-determination struggle of the USSR still has not been realised in many ex-Soviet countries but Armenia thankfully did its job and threw out its post-Soviet regime: 

- Why Armenia 'Velvet Revolution' won without a bullet fired https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43948181

- The Economist’s country of the year 2018: Armenia https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/12/22/the-economists-country-of-the-year-2018

- Armenia's Velvet Revolution: Lessons from the Caucasus https://hir.harvard.edu/armenias-velvet-revolution/

- Armenia’s Democratic Dreams: The country’s Velvet Revolution took its cues from democratic movements in Latin America rather than from other revolutions in the post-Soviet world. Here’s why that’s a good thing. https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/11/07/armenias-democratic-dreams/

... but others are still struggling to attain self-determination, in Azerbaijan's case unfortunately the dictatorship is too strong (oil money) and people have not even tried meaningful protests to topple the regime. 

So bringing up a ridiculous analogy of Denmark is not even an analogy to be contemplated. Nagorno Karabakh was first in protesting and facing the same brutal dictatorships using forces just like Belarus for example, but with the added component of ethnic-conflict which only meant: uprooting of historic Armenian people form their historic home for ever! You understand now?

The Helsinki Final Act is clear: It puts territorial integrity at the same level as self-determination. This was a key agreement to force the USSR to open up, and it worked, Nagorno Karabakh was one such opening up which was one of the triggers for the USSR to fall. Understand now?

And yes, the USSR agreed with the west on self-determination. Azerbaijan also agreed. Nagorno Karabakh conflict started in the USSR. Azerbaijan just commemorated the singing of the agreement.

5396,"&gt; You are applying modern understandings and concepts of race, gender, and economy to ancient cultures.

Well what else could i? Unless you suggest there exists some objective historical lense to view things through? 

If you want to learn more about race in ancient greece (which is the areas i have specifically looked into during university) you can look at:

*Herodotus and the Black Body: A Critical Race Theory Analysis* by Tristan Samuels (2015)

Or *Proto-Racism in Graeco-Roman Antiquity* by Benjamin Isaac (2016)

Or more in-depth is Isaac's book from 2004 *The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity*

If you want to argue for a positive view of gender in ancient greece, i would be interested to hear your arguments and sources for that. As far as i have been able to read and research in the area (not my field of expertise, so i would be interested if you could correct my view). 

Since your argument is that ""we can be proud of this, but not ashamed of that"" because of cherry-picking, i dont see you arguing from a position of good faith...

This is what rule-based order means.""

None of this is factual,it is just your opinion warped by  Armenian nationalist maximalist interpretation of what Azerbaijan agreed to.

What is factual,is that without diplomatic relations,only way 2 sides can talk is through mediators or through conflict.

"" The OSCE Minks Group settlement process is a **reasonable compromise based on the Helsinki Final Act** to **ensure a future of peace, stability, and prosperity for Armenia and Azerbaijan and the broader region** as the rule-based order says - and not the maximalist positions of either the Armenian side nor Aliyev's.""

Again,it is just your opinion man.I do not personally believe it is maximalist to want internationally recognized land of yours to be returned...to you.I consider that mainstream position.Maximalist position would be something that is not already agreed,something that is way to much.

"" UN General Assembly resolution says "" this:[https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/62/243](https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/62/243) 

Just read it.

  ""**local Armenian forces of Nagorno Karabakh** "" were never mentioned.UN general assembly and UN members do not recognize local Armenian forces of NK as legitimate and as such can not demand anything from them.

It would be like UN resolution demanding Colombian cartels to stop producing drugs.

As previosly explained :Only countries can have ""forces/military"".Non state actors can only have paramilitaries.

"" Azerbaijan can promise to make Nagorno Karabakh a heaven just like it tells everyone the country is a multicultural human rights respecting liberal transparent democracy when it is one of the worst authoritarian corrupt human-rights violating petro-dictator existing regimes which doesn't provide self-determination event to its own Azerbaijani citizens. You are defending this regime against Azerbaijani people.""

No I am defending territorial integrity of Azerbaijan against occupation by another country which supports violent rebels.

 ""In a rule-based order it is not about increasing territories, it is about democracy, respect for human rights and equal rights.""

Therefore human rights and equal rights can not be used as argument for land theft,military aggression and occupation,e.g. Denmark is better place in HRI then Armenia,but it still does not have a right to support  violent rebels and to military occupy parts of Armenia that are internationally recognized as such.

It is a simple concept.

I specifically said ""USA nuked its own territory"".As in past tense.

Country also has a right to agree with other countries to do what it wants.It can

 also sign or not sign agreements or even pull out of them,if the country deems it fit.

&gt;“The two 42-day trials – including 38 healthy adults each – did not find any serious adverse effects among participants, and confirmed that the vaccine candidates elicit an antibody response,” the study’s authors wrote.

5527,"Respectfully, I think you don’t understand the difference between EEZ and territorial waters, a mistake many people seem to be making.

An EEZ doesn’t dictate who or what can or cannot pass through it, it’s simply the area in which the owner can exploit any natural resources. It’s still considered international waters and maritime law applies there, not the law of the EEZ owner. So essentially, it’s not the territory of the EEZ that belongs to the owner country, but rather the resources within that territory

Territorial waters, on the other hand, are the waters around a country’s landmass. In these waters you’d need permission to enter, and the owner country’s law applies there. Greece currently wants to extend its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles (except where Turkish coast is less than 12nm away, in which case the border would be in the middle). Turkey objects to this as it would mean having to ask Greece for permission to pass.

[Why is this so?:](https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/policy/conditions-membership_en)

&gt;stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities;
&gt;
&gt;a functioning market economy and the capacity to cope with competition and market forces in the EU;
&gt;
&gt;the ability to take on and implement effectively the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.

It seems these are reasonable goals to set? While I understand that integration is a lot of work, it still seems that recognizing Kosovo would ensure better relations with the west and a means to appease those in the EU

&gt;This whole agreement meant nothing to the EU and the only countries that benefited from it were America and Israel and even if we joined we would end up in worse position than Croatia where next to nothing nothing changed since they entered EU.

But Kosovo is the big sticking point within the EU, alongside proper elections. While I am ignorant regarding Croatia's position within the EU, I'd be hard pressed to see Croatia joining the EU as bad.

First, they are constantly looking to find cost-effective ways of influence/aggression to mitigate their economic disadvantage. A well-known example is influencing democratic elections through social media and hack-and-release. 

Second, yeah, they don’t have total control, but enough to mess up the lives of millions and at least delay societal development.

Also, authoritarianism riding on top of a kleptocracy simply cannot be as competent as more liberal systems where merit does compete less with ideological disposition.

It would look good long term, but there are risks that they will be able to leverage the destabilizing effects of global warming or that emerging technologies like AI will turn out to be a cheap force equalizer. I would like to have the current Kremlin ideology gone until then.

Greece thinks they own the Aegean sea and East Mediterranean sea according to an agreement that Turkey didn't sign. Recently Greece made agreements for the Western Mediterranean Sea and expand their borders without talking to other Mediterranean countries and Turkey got it as a treat. 

Greece claims the Aegean sea is their while all West cost of Turkey’s border like a sea Greek.

Turkey sent ships for gas research and some military ship for support. Greece took it a treat and claimed it’s their sea and Turkey has no right. 

Turkey knows what is a fair border and asks it. Greece rejects it. Also, Greece recently made agreements with Egypt, Italy, and France and they think the other country will protect them.

Turkey doesn't care and they are ready if it comes to war. Turkey also now Greece is a lap dog of the EU the gate, accept refugees, so the EU supports them on paper. 

But they are not willing to go war for Greece while they don’t worth it. 

France has always been a barking dog, so they bark. But Turkey also knows they don't have balls.

5691,"&gt;Modern Italian is literally just an evolution of Latin. So what? Modern Italians don't speak Latin. It's like that with every language. Nothing special about that.

Literally missed the entirety of the point i made and just repeated your ignorance but this time with Italian. 

It's like yeah...Italian language is the evolution of the latin language in Italy much like Spanish is the evolution of the latin language in Spain , French in France, Portuguese in Portugal, Romanian in Romania etc etc That's a common heritage that they all share


&gt; What you want isn't just heritage and culture, you want to be the exclusive rightful heirs of a culture that extended from Spain to India for almost a millennium and is a part of the heritage of the whole of Europe and Middle East

lol who said that? First of all, Hellenic culture really only reached Spain through the Roman empire. Ancient Greek concepts and inovasions are/were used in Spain but there isn't much direct greek heritage going around in Spain unless of course you are talking about the Roman empire which was heavily influenced by Greeks. But if you want to entertain concepts like Democracy, the Olympics, Theater etc then sure.

Europeans/Middle Easterns/Indians can share their pride for Ancient Greek culture if they want too or if they see it's impact on their every day life in their countries today....as long as they don't try to claim it as being anything other than **Greek** or **Hellenic**. For obvious reasons. Which brings us to your other point.
 
&gt;You are upset when some other nation is proud about something from ancient Greece or claims it as a part of its own heritage.

Yes, if a nation tries to claim Ancient Greek culture/heritage as **their own** and as something ""not Greek"" then yes there is a problem...

Which i'd guess is pretty darn self explanatory and obvious as to why there would be a problem with that. 

&gt;By contrast, Italians don't claim to be the exclusive rightful heirs of ancient Rome.

Actually....a lot of them do if you ask them. 

**But** most importantly ROME was an empire, Greece was **not** an empire until Alexander the Great made it one. Greece/Hellas/Ελλάδα in majority of it's history was a very specific piece of land which was comprised of a bunch of Hellenic city states with ethnic greeks inhabiting them. The same land that modern Greeks still live in to this very day. That was for the bigger part of Greece's history, Alexander the Great's empire was the latter part of what was considered Ancient Greece. 

Also when Croatias are discussing something specifically of Roman heritage they aren't saying ""Croatians did/built/had x"" , they specify with **Romans**. 

Same way if someone in say India wants to highlight parts of Hellenic/Greek heritage in their modern country that they are proud of, they should specify the heritage that they are talking about, which would be **Greek** heritage. 

What your comment says to me is that you are upset since you don't like Greece or Greek people today that we are the closest modern day successors of what is an undeniably great lineage (of many others, greeks don't have a monopoly or rich heritage this world is rich on history and culture). But you are like ""Greeks (which i don't like) can't have all that to be proud of, everyone should have it"" ...well that's not how it works unfortunately for you.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/imb7ne/for_greece_the_battle_of_salamis_never_ended/g40wz2y/,De_Bananalove,1599245912

Don’t get me wrong - I’m not saying this to attack you in any way!!

For us Europeans it’s just hard to understand how the myth of „American exceptionalism“ came to be in the fire place. 

Just to name a few things: 
You have absolutely shitty, nearly non-existent employee protection and you can be fired in the blink of an eye,  you pay enormous amounts for the absolute basic form of healthcare and are still at risk of going bankrupt if something really bad happens and last but not least you are constantly in the Top5 of countries with most gun-related deaths. 

And what’s really amazing about all of this - somehow a large part of your population has convinced itself that this is just how is has to be. 

That it’s not possible to do it in a different way - despite large parts of Europe (and especially  the EU) having figured this out a few decades ago.

Now am fine with defining liberal through liberalism, but you still end up with opposing liberalism and conservative, one being linked to individual freedom, the other to keeping the established power structures in place you still end up in a tight place.
