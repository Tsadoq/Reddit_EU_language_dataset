Baptisms, circumcisions, people can make those decisions when they're older. When the two options are: making an informed decision about your own body vs having your parent make a decision (whether informed or not) about your body that you may not agree with, I'll pick the first option every single time.

It's literally a question of do you want authority over your body or not? I certainly do. My mother once told me she wanted to baptize me as a baby, but decided against it, leaving it up to me to decide. As a staunch atheist, I will always be happy she didn't force any religious stuff on me.

8,"My wife and I just welcomed a son into this world 2 weeks ago in the U.S..

We were asked if we wanted to circumcise and we talked it over with the obstetrician to get her advice. She said that it wasn't a big concern either way. The medical community doesn't see poor outcomes from either option. There are a handful of studies that show some positives for circumcision around hygiene and urinary tract infections. She wasn't for or against but saw more positives than negatives. On her advice we completed the procedure. Anecdotally, I think every boy in the ward was circumcised.

Just a quick review of WebMD on the topic brings this quote, [""The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) found that the health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks, but the benefits are not great enough to recommend universal newborn circumcision.""](https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/guide/circumcision#2-5)

That reads more positively than negatively, and shows general support from the medical community here.

I think there are a few things that come into play:

1.) It seems like the medical community in the U.S. was slightly more positive than negative relative to health outcomes when the procedure was performed
2.) Many of our obstetricians are surgeons first (I think this is required in my state). They do what surgeons do. I think the culture would be very different if this was not the norm and we had a broader use of midwives that could not do the procedure.
3.) It's probably some of the easiest money the obstetrician makes. They have extremely challenging jobs and lifestyles here with lots of financial liability. I think this is a lower stress operation and that makes it easier to encourage.
4.) There is value to the obstetrician, but no cost to the patient. It is included with birth cost.
5.) Probably the biggest thing is that most people get it done so it's the default and easy decision.

My question back to you is, why do you care? What has any circumcised American done to make you uncomfortable? Have you thought for a moment that rather than volunteer conjecture about ""praised circumcision"" that it may be better to gather actual info?

	In a new building wedged between the sea and a power station in north-west Helsinki, a closely watched experiment in elderly care is taking place. A group of about 30 people aged over 60 are eating dinner at a housing development called Kotisatama, whose facilities include two saunas, a roof terrace and an exercise room for circuit training and pilates.

But there are no staff. Kotisatama is a community house in which both single elderly people and couples live together and share the chores. “The main purpose of this house is to keep us active,” says Leena Vahtera, a 72-year-old resident and chair of the project. “This is not a nursing home.”

Her husband died in 2007 while her two sons have their own families. “I didn’t want to be a burden to them. I saw how my own mother was so lonely. We are sure that the state can’t provide the services that old people may need one day. We want to make decisions on our own lives,” she says.

The Kotisatama development is attracting a lot of attention because Ms Vahtera is part of one of the most rapidly ageing populations in the world. Among rich, industrialised countries only Japan and South Korea have had larger increases in recent years than Finland. While people over 85 represented just 1.5 per cent of the population in 2000, today they are 2.7 per cent, and by 2070 are expected to be close to 9 per cent.

Finland has been discussing what to do about its demographic problems for almost two decades, pushing reforms of its healthcare, local government, social care and pensions system. “Finland is a rational country. It’s something we have taken very seriously and we have looked decades forward — something not done in most countries,” says Ilkka Kaukoranta, chief economist at SAK, Finland’s trade union confederation.

Yet finding answers has proved nigh on impossible. Finland’s three-party coalition government collapsed last month over its failure to pass landmark healthcare and local government reforms before an election on April 14. The only long-term issue related to demographic trends that has been addressed in two decades of trying has been pension reform.

For Europe, Finland may be a warning about the intractable political problems that lie ahead. Its population is ageing faster than any other European country, although Germany and Italy will have bigger peaks of older people later on this century. The lesson from Finland may be that trying to make health and elderly care costs sustainable involves the types of political choices few governments are willing to make, raising questions about long-term economic growth and the health of public finances for increasingly cash-strapped governments across Europe.

While parts of the rest of Europe face what researchers at the Robert Schuman Foundation have called “demographic suicide”, the lessons from the Finnish experience are complex. Breaking the omertà around ageing — as the foundation argued for — has not particularly helped in Finland. “In European terms we have been preparing early but only a little has been done,” says Marja Vaarama, a professor of social work at the University of Eastern Finland.

The country is a vivid demonstration that demographic change forces hard choices between politically unpalatable reforms and potentially deep belt-tightening. As a senior eurozone official remarked at the height of the 2010-11 sovereign debt crisis involving Greece, Spain, Portugal and others: “If I want to get really depressed, I think about what we’re not talking about at all — the ticking demographic time-bomb.”

“It’s very demanding and very tough to do. There are so many practical problems to be solved. Europe is going to be even messier,” says Timo Soini, the outgoing foreign minister, speaking before the government’s collapse. Another top Finnish policymaker is blunter: “This is a serious blow to our credibility as a reforming nation. But if we can’t do it, what hope have the rest?”

Finland’s ageing population results from the baby boom that followed the 1939-40 Winter war with the Soviet Union and the second world war. Life expectancy has steadily risen and now lies at about 79 for newborn boys and 84 for girls. Over 65s passed the under 14s as a bigger age group a few years ago and by 2070 they are expected to be about a third of the population — compared to just over half for people of working age and about 10 per cent children.

“This is the main engine to the structural imbalance of our economy and our public finances,” says Kai Mykkanen, Finland’s interior minister. In recent years, Finland has started to calculate its so-called sustainability gap — the long-term difference between government spending and income that will be aggravated by an ageing population. For now, it is about 4 per cent of gross domestic product.

Successive governments in Helsinki have tried to narrow this gap with a broad array of policy proposals. Major reforms of the pensions system were passed in 2001 and again in 2014, and most experts now think it is on a solid financial footing.

22,"But reforming health and social care has proved far more difficult, defeating each of the last three governments. Part of the problem is that health and social care are the responsibility of municipalities and these range massively in size, from the largest — Helsinki — with more than 600,000 inhabitants to the smallest with just 92. Providing a full range of services is increasingly difficult for many of the smaller municipalities and waiting times are often long.
Chart about ageing population of Finland

The current government tried to combine a shake-up in local government with the health and social care reform package. The problem was that the two main parties in the coalition come from completely different constituencies. The Centre party of prime minister Juha Sipila draws its support from predominantly rural areas while the National Coalition party of finance minister Petteri Orpo are more focused on the big cities.

Healthcare experts suggested having five or six regions, centred around Finland’s biggest cities. But this was anathema to the Centre party, which instead proposed 18 newly formed counties. 

It is a painful lesson for the rest of Europe as political fragmentation is increasing across the continent, making government formation in many countries highly difficult and complicating the chances of changing such sensitive policy areas as healthcare. “It’s hard to do reforms with multi-party governments,” says economist Olli Karkkainen.

The final reform proposal was highly complex and ended up drawing opposition from many quarters including complaints that it went against Finland’s constitution. The reform ran out of time before parliament was dissolved for the national elections. The Centre party in particular is expected to be heavily punished in the polls, in large part due to resentment over the healthcare issue. 

The next government in Helsinki is expected to make another attempt at reforming health and social care, perhaps by breaking it up into its individual parts to try to make it more manageable. But a three- or four-party coalition is likely to be needed, complicating matters further. All this could weigh on Finland’s public finances, with credit rating agencies warning they may take negative action if reforms do not materialise.

Economists at the Finnish central bank looked into the similarities between their country and Japan — with Finland’s population in 15 years’ time expected to look like Japan’s today — and concluded: “If decisions on reforming the structures of the economy are postponed far into the future, in the light of Japan’s experiences this may result in reduced growth and employment, with consequent high costs.”

Beyond the pure politics and economics, experts in Finland say the debate on ageing needs to be rethought. Prof Vaarama says that it is wrong to classify all people aged over 65 as “old”. She argues true old age starts at 80-85. Before that, people could still be working and be consumers in the new so-called “silver economy”. “Society doesn’t yet understand what longevity is. We should look at how we can benefit from this population,” she adds.

Finland has switched from prioritising institutional care of the elderly to trying to keep them at home for as long as possible. Prof Vaarama says this is good but only if they get sufficient care: “There are a lot of complaints that they do not have enough personnel, they just do 15 minute visits.” She adds that simple policies such as better physiotherapy at home could keep couples together and stave off loneliness, which is becoming an increasing problem.

That was the thinking behind Kotisatama, where 83 people — with a median age of 72 — live in 63 apartments. There are 18 couples, four single men and the rest are single women. Each week, groups of six take turns to cook and clean.

“It keeps our heads and legs in good condition. It’s better to get old together,” says Ms Vahtera. She adds that the residents are well aware that resources are limited at both local and national government levels: “In the long term, buildings like this save them money.”

Juha Metso is a former doctor and now head of social and health services in Espoo, a city just west of Helsinki that is home to big companies, such as Nokia and Angry Birds maker Rovio Entertainment. Espoo’s The population aged over 75 is growing at about 5 per cent a year. 

But Mr Metso says he does not see an ageing population as “a problem”. “It’s a joyful result of better living conditions, services, better nutrition. The older people in Espoo are VIP citizens and we need to take care of them,” he adds.

He argues that municipalities need to adapt to the needs of citizens, offering more home services — including being available 24 hours a day — as well as more meeting places for the elderly such as in libraries. “The current discussion is more about change than how do we create better health,” he says.

One example he cites is elderly women who suffer hip fractures. By operating faster and starting rehab straight away, Espoo managed to cut their hospital time by a third and reduce the death rate by 6-7 per cent. The reduced need for beds — 45 — was equivalent to a new maternity ward.

Seen from the cities, the solution is clear. Both Mr Metso and Kari Nenonen, the former mayor of neighbouring Vantaa, say services need to be combined in rural areas, with smaller hospitals being closed. “You would have to travel further to get functioning services,” says Mr Metso.

But the political trouble of such a solution is easy to see just across the border from Finland. A maternity ward was closed two years ago in Solleftea in northern Sweden, forcing expectant mothers to drive 100km to the nearest alternative. A year later, support for the ruling Social Democrats was decimated in the town. “This is the problem: we know what needs to be done but doing it means you will probably not get re-elected,” says one Finnish policymaker.
Coalition-building: new government will have to engage with True Finns

Finland’s elections on April 14 are likely to be one of the more extreme examples of a European trend towards political fragmentation. As many as five parties could score about 15 per cent or higher. 

The opposition Social Democrats lead the polls, benefiting from their ideological difference to the most rightwing government to rule Finland for decades. The Centre party of prime minister Juha Sipila are set to be the big losers of the vote, losing about a third of their support. 

The wild card is the populist party True Finns. They entered government for the first time in 2015 but ended up breaking in two. Their government ministers all formed a new party, Blue Reform, which is set to sink without trace at these elections. But buoyed by the fallout from a sex abuse scandal in the Arctic involving several immigrants, the more hardline version of True Finns has gained support and could finish in second or third place. 

One dilemma for the other parties is whether to exclude True Finns from power as has been done with the Sweden Democrats next door. But Finland has a tradition “of co-opting difficult politicians”, according to Risto Penttila, a businessman turned candidate for the centre-right National Coalition party. 

He says the election is a peculiar one because it is not about “debating the really important issues”, pointing to foreign policy, Europe and to some extent the economy. Instead, much of the debate has revolved around the True Finns and its opposition to immigration and climate change measures. Meanwhile the collapse of the healthcare reform overshadowed any credit the government could take for reviving what was a moribund economy when it took over in 2015.

The reason a white person isn't well-equipped to answer whether or not blackface is OK is because well, they're not black. How can a white person be qualified to definitively state that their participation in blackface is OK or not? That's mostly a question for black persons to decide. It's like if some European comedy troupe did a skit about Jewish Holocaust that was deemed as insensitive by many. The proper persons to ask would be Jews, not just plain Euros. 

I don't personally think the Dutch blackface is worth admonishing because it doesn't carry the same historical connotations that American blackface did -- but at the same time, it's still insensitive because blackface entertainment was not unknown in Netherlands and neither were things like human zoos or colonialism. Racism is not alien to Dutch people, in other words. 

So am I going to campaign against it? No. But do I think it's a tradition worth continuing? Probably not. I'm Russian, I should know about having to deal with a lot of national traditions that aren't worth continuing.

135,"Actually, it's 21% now I think, anyway tax is not the only problematic salary component. Not sure what is English term, but we call it super gross salary. That is the amount of money you actually cost your employer. And basically net income is like a half of that value (or a bit less) . So basically employer could give you nearly double money, but he has to pay various things before even actually gross amount is reached. And then you pay tax + health/social insurance from that gross amount. People in fact complain about it. However, current ""social"" government needs a lot money in order to cover costs of their short term populistic agenda (and to fill their own pockets too).

When it comes to why progressive taxing was abolished, it wasn't actually that bad of a thing. This was introduced as simplification of taxation system - everything was taxed with the same value 19%. It really kickstarted the economy growth and lured a lot of foreign investors. However, then Smer came into the power with their populistic short term agendas which costs a lot, but also bring a lot of votes. So instead of further decreasing this single tax value, they increased it. They defended it by using economic crisis as an excuses, but even now when economy is in quite great state, they keep the tax high and actually crippled the single level rule by introducing various exceptions to it. To be honest I can see advantages of a single tax level, but current government really crippled and broke whole system. Also keep in mind that even tho it's 21% that doesn't mean your whole income is taxed, certain portion of every income is considered non-taxable, tax is paid from gross income minus insurance and minus bare minimum (and maybe some other values).

That right there are 3 problems already.

Often their political rights are explicitly and [severely curtailed](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/military-folks-and-politics-3332818) therefore.

2) When soldiers are being active vs civil leadership that is critical of the role of the military (in an arguably peace promoting way), that is a blaring klaxon warning.

This led quite a few people into thinking all this is maybe true, including some MPs in Parliament.  It is also part of the reason why there is the current impasse in Parliament - the hardline Brexiteer MPs want the fantasy promised by the Leave campaign, so take a tough stance and vote for a hard Brexit, so the EU will come begging for the privilege of doing business with the Great and Mighty British Empire (they never got the memo that it no longer really exists), whereas those who are a bit more in touch with reality are voting against that in favour of a much softer Brexit with ties to the EU, as, short of simply cancelling Brexit and remaining in the EU, this is what is best for the UK.",,/r/europe/comments/b8y641/juncker_no_more_short_brexit_delays_unless_leave/ek2osfx/,Zmidponk,1554345312

240,"If people are throwing questionable American research towards you allegedly proving health benefits, then here is an actual study made by leading experts on the area from across Europe and Canada denying the findings by the APA. 

&gt; To these authors, only 1 of the arguments put forward by the American Academy of Pediatrics has some theoretical relevance in relation to infant male circumcision; namely, the possible protection against urinary tract infections in infant boys, which can easily be treated with antibiotics without tissue loss. The other claimed health benefits, including protection against HIV/AIDS, genital herpes, genital warts, and penile cancer, are questionable, weak, and likely to have little public health relevance in a Western context, and they do not represent compelling reasons for surgery before boys are old enough to decide for themselves.

Source:
https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/131/4/796

I personally don't trust American research on this subject in any capacity, because of its poor track record on this area. American research are often impacted by politics and religious convictions, and this area doesn't seem any different. 

You should also be aware that American research often uses samples from African men rather than Western men in order to attain more advantageous results, as the conditions in African countries makes this issue vastly different. They have a high degree of these STDs in their population, a lack of hygiene, a lack of vaccinations and a lack of condoms. Their studies are also often made using adult African men rather than children, which is what this thread is actually about.  

I haven't even gotten into the advantages of not being circumcised, but this comment is already long, so I won't. However, I'll leave you with a thought. Every mammal with exterior genitals have foreskin, even women have skin protecting their clitoris. Why would that be the case if it wasn't a benefit to have?

278,"Not Paxan but he is correct. It is not overriding any sovereignty since Romania may make any decision it likes. Simply having diplomatic consequences are not an infringement of sovereignty but a result of others exercising theirs. 

What would be considered affronts to sovereignty would include:
* Refusing to recognize Romania's government as legitimate 
* Refusing to provide Romania with basic diplomatic channels (i.e it isn't considered a country)
* Invading Romania and seizing territory

In other words, Romania's sovereignty is defined by whether or not it as a country can make decisions that are recognized. If Romania is controlled by a foreign government (a vassal state), then you wouldn't say it's sovereign. If Romania is a country nobody will hold any relations with - then it's not sovereign because nobody respects it as one. 

For countries to tell Romania ""if you do this, we will do this"" is not an affront to Romania's sovereignty since it can make the decision on its own. If the EU didn't respect the sovereignty of Romania - it would be an order, not a warning of consequences.

I would be equally surprised if most native Amsterdammers could name all the Dutch provinces and their capitals. Even in the US, a lot of people cannot name and place all their states on a map. Even less so their capitals. But I don't see what this is supposed to demonstrate exactly: how good people are at remembering what they're taught at school? 

People being mostly focused and knowledgeable on their immediate neighbourhood is a steady constant of human behaviour. It can hardly come as a surprise.

&gt;large diversity and non overlapping history

Now this is entirely absurd and shows a very superficial knowledge of European countries and their respective histories and cultures. 

Their history do overlap. European countries have their cultural differences (quite logically), but they share common societal values, principles and ideologies you won't find elsewhere. For a very simple reason: ideas and behaviours have never been stopped by borders, and countries aren't secluded from everything and everyone else.

The [revolutions of 1848](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848) are but one vibrant example coming to mind, out of thousands of years of cultural and societal mutual interpenetrations. To the point one can legitimately talk about a European model and a coherent European culture that is widely different from what you'll find even in former European colonies, like the US.

You might not fully realise because the Netherlands are a rather small country and/or you didn't spent much time studying European history, but people living in larger countries (Germany, France, Spain, Italy, to name a few) are very much aware that their national culture and identity isn't monolithic.

&amp;nbsp;

Regardless, as for_t2 already pointed out, federalisation being about decentralisation of power is not a ""theory"", it's a fact. That's literally how a federation works, that's the whole point: delegating each field to the level of administration that makes the most sense. Just like you wouldn't expect your national government to be in charge of your city garbage collection, you wouldn't expect your city to be in charge of coordinating your railway network. 

At best, they work together, but one level is more appropriate than the other to oversee the task, because depending on what the field is about, the scope simply isn't the same.

They didn't. That's why they aren't reasonable. Obviously they have to pretend, since a formal procedure was enacted.

Then they only propose the UK effectively annex its own territory to a foreign power for nothing. That will *never* pass. They have to know it never will. So they know they are bottlenecking all other decisions behind a useless proposition. They in turn will not concede anything reasonable both parties can actually work with.

They could have negotiated everything, all sorts of trade pact renewals and then still disagree on Northern Ireland. Then we could have a crash out with a sane exit plan. But no, that would be reasonable. That's not negotiation. That's stonewalling and stalling.

&gt;""We are ready for the next step, eyeing a European army,"" Barley said.

&gt;""A European commissioner for defense, a directorate general for defense and European military headquarters would be feasible steps towards this aim of a common European army,” Barley said — but warned against getting the sequencing wrong.

&gt;""I wouldn’t start with a DG defense,"" she said, urging the EU to ""take a substantial decision in which direction we want to move"" first.

&gt;Barley added that it is vital to build on the experience of military cooperation among EU countries, such as a Franco-German brigade or a Dutch-German tank battalion, as well as on recent moves toward converging military capabilities of EU member countries such as the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and European Defense Fund (EDF).

&gt;EU countries have launched 34 PESCO projects, from common production of a Eurodrone (which is supposed to be ready in 2025) to the launch of a European spy school.

497,"I will just say the same thing I said in another comment below : These are two entirely unrelated matters (at least directly) 

\- That law was adopted *months ago* after being introduced to the public knowledge and parliament *half a year before*

\- The government's speaker, newly introduced a few days ago, words are indeed despicable.

  
Ideally we would have a better speaker but who are we kidding, a government speaker is just here to protect the government's ass with whatever means available, the new one just happened to say openly what others have been doing for a long time which is, breaking news, lying at times.

&amp;#x200B;

So now that we have these two info what do we do? We revoke the law? How does that make any sense, in no way is that law a bad thing the way it is supposed to be applied here.  
That law, which is called ""fake news"" is also far from being as big as it may sound, it has in fact only 3 main points

\- Starting from 3 months before any election any citizen can call for the judge to stop a fake news from spreading, said judge should decide in 48h info if the info is ""obviously fake, deliberately so, massive (in the sense that it already spreads) and artificial""

\- Social networks have to be more transparent about where the ads they display come from: who paid and how much

\- CSA (Superior council of Audiovisual, the instance in charge of TV and radio related things basically), can decide to stop the broadcast of a a foreign channel which is suspected of manipulation

&amp;#x200B;

So there you have it, more than morally doubtful on the government's end (but alas that seems to be the share of most democracy accross the western worlds minus a few in northern Europe) but 100% unrelated.

536,"This is very interesting to see from a trafic-technical perspective, but the problem of this plan is Germany. In order to get to the continental mainland, each train would have to get to Germany and through that. The direct route from Copenhagen/Seeland is the [Vogelfluglinie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogelfluglinie), where trains have to use an archaic ferry traject. While the direct line between Hamburg and Kopenhagen is only 280 Kilometers, the trip takes 4,5 hours. From Hamburg, there are few main lines. One goes to the south and takes 1,5-2 hours for the 130 Km direct line to Hannover. The route from Hamburg to Berlin takes 1,5-2 hours, but only has capacity for one train per hour and direction due to congestion. The route from Hamburg to the Ruhr area and behind that the BENELUX countries is similar.

Within a reasonable amount of time, it is only possible to reach some metropolitan areas in Germany from Sweden. With the current state of German rail infrastructure, that is not set to improve soon - see i.e. the disinterest in the Fixed Fehmarnbelt Crossing - they may be able to set up a train from Stockholm to i.e. the Netherlands with in the most optimistic case a set of diverted waggons to Oslo via Göteborg, but there is little potential for more. Getting beyond Germany may not be an option, as an Example the route from Austria to Kopenhagen takes 16 hours, see this example in which i ended up missing the connecting train in Hamburg due to a delay and had to wait for 2 more hours. There are few sleeper trains with routes longer than 12 hours, which appear to be the upper limit for such routes. German Infrastructure politics don't realise, that by neglecting any connections to neighbouring countries, they in turn loose potential passengers on connecting domestic routes. It is worth noting, that with the current state of the relevant lines, there is little potential for long distance passenger traffic from Scandinavia to the mainland. While there is a number of seasonal night trains from the Netherlands to various alpine areas, no such routes are currently operated from Scandinavia, the last one ceased around 1990.

575,"The BBC is moving some of its broadcast licenses to the Netherlands so it can keep transmitting across the European Union in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to people familiar with the matter.

The U.K. licenses relate to the British Broadcasting Corp.’s commercial arm that beams hit shows including “Doctor Who” and “Eastenders” into other EU countries, said the people, who asked not to be named as the matter is confidential. The permits will no longer be valid if Britain leaves the bloc in nine days’ time without a withdrawal agreement.

Political deadlock has raised the risk of a chaotic departure, with Theresa May now seeking help from opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to strike a Brexit deal acceptable to Parliament. The BBC joins international broadcasters such as Discovery Inc., Viacom Inc. and Comcast Corp.’s NBC Universal in relocating licenses elsewhere in the EU.

“As an international broadcaster operating a number of commercial channels in the EU we are ensuring the necessary arrangements are in place to continue operating those channels in any changed regulatory environment,” a spokesman for BBC Studios said in a statement.

It said the change would mean relocating a limited number of staff responsible for editorial decisions at those channels.

The U.K. is Europe’s broadcasting hub, home to more channels than any other EU member state. International media companies collectively spend about 1 billion pounds ($1.32 billion) annually in the U.K. on things like content, production facilities and technology, according to research by media analysis firm Oliver &amp; Ohlbaum commissioned by lobby group the Commercial Broadcasters Association.

Through BBC Studios, the BBC makes some channels available elsewhere in the EU, such as BBC Entertainment, which carries reruns of shows such as “Bargain Hunt” and “Antiques Roadshow.” The BBC generates hundreds of millions of pounds of revenue from EU markets, according to the U.K.’s telecommunication regulator Ofcom.

EU rules say broadcasters need to have their head office, a significant part of their workforce or a satellite uplink in the country to qualify for a license there.",,/r/europe/comments/b91cj3/bbc_triggers_its_brexit_plan_in_order_to_keep/ek1gfon/,virtual1observer,1554314465

Finland was *not* mentioned in the treaty and was independent to begin with. It was recognised by the Soviet Union, followed by other powers. 

Around the end of the Finnish Civil War, it looked like Germany would win the war, and they diverted resources to Finland, helping them win the war, but at a cost.

Really the main problem with nuclear is that it moves so slowly and newer, safer designs take a long time to take over from old, unsafe designs. But part of the reason for *that* is the continual protests which make it hard to upgrade / replace old plants.

There really should be a Europe-wide agreement to cooperate on building and maintaining nuclear power plants, and replacing them on a strict 20-year schedule. That's really short, but I think that's necessary to motivate people to think about efficient and safe construction and recycling ahead of time, and to convince local citizens they will not be stuck with a slowly rotting nuclear power plant forever.

662,"&gt;If you don't want your German citizenship to be at risk don't have a second one, it's as simple as that.

You're correct in general but there's a **very** important elephant in the room here: Some nations make it impossible to incredibly difficult to revoke their citizenship - Iran being the most notable in a German context. 

In a nutshell, if you're born to an Iranian man (even if that is your only connection to Iran) you will always be considered an Iranian citizen and the same will be true for future children. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/iran/comments/25b4vy/renounce_iranian_citizenship/) an older post from /r/Iran talking about this issue specifically.

Dual citizenships in those cases are technically still a privilege but practically an absolute necessity (and where exceptions are most frequently granted).

An example there was Trump's travel ban which [affected thousands of people who have nothing to do with Iran, including British and German MPs](https://www.handelsblatt.com/today/politics/travel-ban-tens-of-thousands-of-germans-barred-from-u-s-travel/23565974.html?ticket=ST-3775328-f2rQU2ckWZsyjKwXxNcd-ap3).

663,"&gt; Read closely: they should be compensated for the effort. That's why copyright doesn't really help artists: it does not help them when they do need it most, it only helps them when they already have a successful product on their name, when most of the work and risk is behind them.

How do you arrive at this interpretation? ""Effort"" is the amount of work required to create the product, regardless of how well it markets. I suppose it's true that some contracts may remunerate based on percentages, but (a) that'd be part of the contract whose conditions the artist signed voluntarily and (b) I believe a fixed commission is the standard these days.

&gt; How does that help the artist? The artist needs material support to sustain themselves and the conditions and tools of their trade. That is all. The artist does not need to Big Brother what all other people do.

I can't follow you here. ""Big Brother"" is, in essence, the police enforcing the law. Without the law to protect the rightholder, the value of a work drops by default, since it'd become legal to replicate for zero compensation to anyone. Since it would eat into the industry's profits, it would also lower the industry's interest in supporting the creator. Where does the material support for the artist come from if they don't have a right to it? You're condemning them to, in effect, become beggars.

&gt; A tenth would still be more than anyone could reasonably expect to keep track to select from, let alone find time to enjoy it. On top of that, the media that does get funded would be better adapted to customer demand, because it would necessarily keep close track of public interest, rather than a record company executive making a decision and then pulling out the big advertising guns to force people to buy those records so they can recoup their investment.

I have a hunch your opinion would change once entertainment and its publishing turns from a profit-oriented industry into a hobby scene because no-one would fund big budget movies or videogames anymore. Music would probably be impacted less as it doesn't require quite as big an investment to produce, but look at how many millions of dollars it costs to produce a blockbuster. You can forget about crowdfunding those, aside from perhaps a few globally viral phenomenons.

&gt; Consider those two facts: Some studies say the top 1% of musicians earn 77% of the records income &amp; Musicians Get Only 12 Percent of the Money the Music Industry Makes then you realize that the median artist does not get more than a trickle from record sales.

Arguably this is because small artists are less popular, hence the reliance on life gigs as the most important source on income. We're essentially looking at two ""castes"" of musicians here: the median artist who has not yet broken through, and the big names of global fame with music videos on YouTube and stuff, who only managed to become this big due to industry support and advertisement.

Are you *really* willing to give up on the latter?

On a side note, musicians getting 12% does not mean the other 88% just disappear in some fat cat's pocket.

&gt; Why not? They have been surviving just fine, even with legal and illegal digital copies everywhere, just like theaters survived after the arrival of television. People pay for the experience. And if they don't, why should cinemas survive?

They've been surviving because stuff gets shown there first and illegal copies tend to have a shitty quality, not to mention have a tendency to only appear later. Most tickets get sold in the opening weeks.

An AAA-movie's only source of revenue would be TV, streaming, or sales. And you can forget about streaming -- nobody would pay for Netflix if you can reliably get the stuff elsewhere for free. Consequently, Netflix wouldn't fund the studios and/or publishers. Same for digital or physical sales. TV might still work, since the station airing the work would have defacto control over its distribution at the first time it's shown. However, once the movie is ""out in the wild"", it would get replicated as well, and with a movie only being worth a single showing, a drop in value sounds like the most logical consequence.

&gt; How do you think it works today? Someone or something credits the money. They're only getting money from the game afterwards, and none of that is guaranteed.

And that someone tends to be a company with a lot of money, which expects to see returns for this investment.

But the gaming scene is a good example of the future you promote. Look at the small indie developers: without doubt, there's a lot of creativity to be found here, often more than among the big names even. In terms of quality, however, you'd have to contend with a massively degraded standard in terms of visuals, music and voice-acting, as unsurprisingly it'd be a crowd-funded hobby product created by two guys/gals in a garage.

Don't get me wrong, I love stuff like FTL or Bomber Crew. Doesn't mean I'd want to give up on future Mass Effects or Fallouts.

&gt; If you view mankind as inherently prone to exploitation and theft, you really are conservative. Conservatives think that people are bad unless they are forced to be good. Leftists think that people can be good, they just need to get the chance.

Oh no, this has nothing to to with conservatism -- it's called being *realist* and recognizing that humans cannot function in anarchy. I'm sorry, but bad people exist, and unless curtailed by law they tend to make life worse for the good people.

Giving a worker the *right* to remuneration for their work sounds like a very left thing to demand, actually. And artists are a kind of worker, too.

&gt; It's not the same as a homeowner's right, because there's just one house: using it is exclusive. Copying by definition makes another copy. It would be like policing every other house in the world to make sure no one has the same carpet and tapestry combination that you do.

Only if you willfully ignore that the creation of free copies of said house has just put the entire construction business out of work.

&gt; Excuses - those examples show how copyright is a commodification of the creative process, not a support system for the artists. It should be impossible for artists to lose control of their rights, and it should die with them, at least. Otherwise it only serves to make it easier for commercial entities to gain control of art.

Hairsplitting - anything sold by anyone is a commodification of said work, that doesn't make the farmer's cow any less of a support system for them. People work because they need money to maintain a lifestyle, this isn't exactly newsworthy, nor should it be used to demonize the concept of intermediaries.

You're limiting yourself too much to the drawbacks of the status quo and in so doing neglect the long-term consequences of your suggestions. An artist's right to their work dies with them? Awesome, that means their stuff can be copied for free if only they'd have an ""accident"". Not only would you defund their estate, you're incentivizing assassination as a means of industrial sabotage. Likewise, if it were illegal for an artist to sell their rights to the work they created, you'd end up with situations where companies have to *expect* the work gets licensed to multiple competitors. Why should anyone invest in advertisement when they have to share its benefits with other corporations that end up ""freeloading""? Why should they even invest in an artist at all, if they cannot monetize their work?

&gt; Medieval kopiists predate the printing press by a millenium. People were copying successful artists all the time - it's how styles came into being. It's a sign of success. The original artist could capitalize on it, usually.

Read carefully, I directly referenced this when I mentioned ""other artists replicating them"". Creating replicas of a work by letting some skilled specialist spend hours on a faithful reproduction isn't exactly the same as hosting an MP3 file on your server, with foreseeable results on the spread of the material in question.

&gt; On the contrary, almost nobody could afford a steam engine back in the day. It was an expensive and risky investment, but nowadays everyone can afford a computer.

You misunderstood, or rather stopped halfway when considering the results I tried to have you arrive at with these examples, *and* you managed to weaken your own argument earlier about the spread of industrial plans. Yes, it was an expensive and risky investment, but it resulted in the creation of companies that are powerful to this very day. Try the same with your PC today and see if you can challenge the megacorps.

&gt; Why do you think that art gets made by companies?

Do you think the artist that gets paid by them cares?

Look, I agree that copyright needs to be looked at in order to curb certain excesses and increase access to older works or incentivize non-profit derivative works. But making any artist, entire industries depend on crowdfunding? Nah. I'm sorry, I think I've got a lot of utopian ideas, but this goes too far even for me. We can talk about this again once we've managed to successfully transfer into a post-scarcity society where everyone has basic income and the importance of currency is lessened, hopefully empowering artists as well as the many specialists who would support them in the creation of their work by no longer having to rely on exploitative megacorps nor inadequate crowdfunding theories.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/b3d1qn/tiemo_wölken_member_of_the_german_social/ek14eqa/,akashisenpai,1554307239

691,"&gt;Yes, you called me a shitty person out of the blue 

If so many comments about how your idea of emigration control is a bad one is too suden, then I nothing I would say could have warn you I guess.   


&gt;and then you tried to twist my argument into arguing in favour of general emigration control.

Yes, this. Have you been evasive? Unsure of your position? Slightly change what your comment can be interpreted as and boom. You are in the clear. 

Emigration control, is emigration control, incentives are incentives. Does not matter what excuses you make for baning one group of innocent people from leaving over the other, you are still taking freedom of people government is supposed to protect. If you meant making positive incentives to make them wanna stay, then cool, of course, why not. 

&gt;And where exactly have I ever spoken in favour of banning people from leaving as you seem to imply?

Emigration is leaving. Emicration control is limiting the way in which they can leave. If they can leave but only for a holiday, those who will want to leave for a job will leave either way. There was a reason why in Eastern Block you had to be trusted and allowed to go for a holiday to Jugoslavia. 

Sprinkling some freedom on making people stay against their will is still oppression. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It was you that was ranting about how wrong I was to assume that people would use Europe to refer to the continent of Europe. I never said anything about there being anything arrogant or offensive about using it to refer to EU, just that I don't think people should downvote others or spend their days shitting on people that use it to refer to the continent.

We have very different recollection of that conversation. So you telling me how Eu people are arrogant when they assume they can use Europe as a substitute for EU and they would be understood within the context they intended and the your next XX comments about how arrogant and incorrect that is was all in my head?

&gt;And I as assume that even people in the EU are learned about basic facts like the EU not covering 2/3 of the European land mass, I also could only assume that you purposely lied to make your point. The point wasn't about that statement in itself but rather it showed what kind of person you were. And as we can see you also lee about what I am arguing.

I mean, you could only assume that, because you liked to lie about what people wrote to you in the past and if you lie, they have to lie as well, right?   
I feel like the point was valid, in the way that you found one think I wrote wrong, admitted it was wrong, and took it as an excuse to make up stuff and get outraged about things people did not write to you. 

&gt;Relevance? And have Turkey really become more democratic?

Before Erdogan came into the office as their president they have been getting better. They have been improving pretty much steadily since Ataturk, they are definitelly better now then they have been in fifties. Are you asking how is it relevant that democratic countries prefer not to limit emigration? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And can you now see why I say you lie? I explicitly said that ""you seem to"" and added a question mark afterwards, meaning that I asked if I was correct in saying that you were arguing that.

Oh, I am sorry, so this was just wrongly formulated question. Okay? It just confused me, because I said nothing that would imply I was arguing that, or because I never said anything like that in many of out comments, while you litterally wrote:

&gt;  
Basically all countries outside of the EU have de facto emigration control due to lack of freedom of movement though. 

Which would imply you thinking, that 'all countries outside of the EU have de facto emigration control due to lack of freedom of movement'. Which is literally what I argued agains this whole time, since it does not make sense, since there is a very big difference between me not letting you out and some completely different person not letting you in. 

&gt;Where I have said that? Source?

One above.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Relevance? Are you just ranting again?

For one who rants, everything is a rant. This one was rant though, just like a sigh saying, okay, you want to limit freedom of others, but hey, at least it is not something that could actually happen in any democratic country, so that is nice.

780,"There is a bipartisan agreement in the US among both the democrats and republicans that NATO is crucial for the US security, there is an ever increasing sentiment that the world is entering another era of great power competition, which means that more focus be given to containment of China and Russia not less. What happens domestically in the US is another thing, but regardless of internal developments (where I don't even see any sways towards gay-persecutions but whatever), the US strategic interests still are to maintain their positions of a superpower. I mean, Russia is actively working to undermine US positions all over the world, including the very US backyard (which is basically the whole western hemisphere).

When it comes to Western Europe and the US, there are obviously some ideological disagreements, but those aren't crucial. The US has been perfectly capable to allign themselves with all sorts of regimes around the world when it served its interests, do you think they would want to drop the partnership with Germany or France, because they are too 'progressive'? No, obviously not, they have very non-ideological issues with them, such as defence spendings, NS2, trade balances and so on.

And while Western European populations might feel a disdain for Trump and as a result for the US as whole, it does not mean their governments will be interested in breaking NATO completely either. In fact they are pretty comfortable with the current situation where the US carries a big part of the burden when it comes to presence in the Eastern NATO flank.

They don't actually want to take over that responsibility. The offer is not on the table at all.

809,"Contrary to some of the opinions expressed on this page, the Queen does have some decisional powers as Royal Prerogative, however, this is limited. The extent of these powers seems unknown (or rather, a matter of debate).

&gt;Today the royal prerogative is available in the conduct of the government of the United Kingdom, including foreign affairs, defence, and national security. The monarchy has a significant constitutional presence in these and other matters, but limited power, because the exercise of the prerogative is in the hands of the prime minister and other ministers or other government officials. 

([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_prerogative_in_the_United_Kingdom))

More to the point:

&gt;Whilst the royal prerogative is deployed by the UK government when making (and unmaking) treaties, the Supreme Court held in _R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union_ that the government could not use the prerogative to serve notice of termination of the UK's membership of the EU (under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union). Instead legislative authority via an Act of Parliament was required by the Government. The Court's reasoning was that such a notice would inevitably affect rights under domestic law (many EU rights having direct effect in the UK). On the assumption that triggering Article 50 would inevitably result in Brexit, using the prerogative in this way would therefore frustrate the intention of parliament to confer those rights. Following this decision, Parliament decided to provide legal authorisation to the Government to serve a notice in accordance with Article 50. This was duly granted in the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 and Theresa May exercised the power on 29 March 2017.

It is not clear to me if _revoking_ article 50 would also require Parliamentary approval, but it seems likely.",România,/r/europe/comments/b8va89/brexit_and_the_queen/ek0l0bu/,multubunu,1554292089

846,"&gt; No, the EU should negotiate for what it wants, not demand it.

It is. In a negotiation you can say ""this is it, take it or leave it I'm not backing down from this point"". Just like May did with her ""red lines"". 

You are rightfully labeling this ""demand"", but just as these negotiations have demonstrated, demanding certain things is part of negotiating.

&gt;That's usually how negotiations work, one side makes an ask, then listens to what it may need in return.

One side first determines what it is willing to give up. Both the UK and EU have set their demands, now we're negotiating on them and the strongest hand will win.

&gt;If the EU was willing to discuss trade issues as well as withdrawal, then the trade issue of the customs border could have been solved.

The EU said the simplest thing in the world: Since we don't know the terms on which you'll depart how in the fuck can we discuss a trade deal. Obviously it is dependent on the flavour of Brexit the UK decides upon.

&gt;It's not special treatment to expect the EU to respect the UK's sovereignty over Northern Ireland.

NI is as part of the UK as it ever was, the issues with NI are purely of the UK's making and the UK's problem.

They had the status quo which was working. They decided to do away with it, ok. Now they're tasked with figuring out how to make it work. It's insane to think that it's the EU's responsibility to tend to agreements and treaties signed between the UK and another sovereign country that will be affected due to the UK's decision.

917,"But are Girocards or VPay connected to any International network like Visa or Mastercard? If not they are just local debit cards, not normal debit cards, so international debit cards may not work. This is a problem in Russia (with some machines only accepting weird local cards) and China (with some only accpeting their local UnionPay system). Or maybe of course it was just broken.

But can’t the governments dictate the fees? I mean when I came to Europe 6 years ago and became based in Warsaw, cards were popular (Poles love tech, good or bad) with a vast majority using international brand debit cards and a sloght majority also credit cards, but they were not as widely accepted. The government made some new law which enforced a much lower fee and the companies did not pull out, they obliged and the card machines litterally hit market stalls after that. Why does the German parliament not force fees down?

Or the US way, where many smaller stores just have a notice that you pay the fee and payments by credit cards are more expensive by x percent. Some people still preffer it. I travel a lot (such is the nature of my job) and have no idea how safe each city is, but I don’t do the taxi to hotel ignorant of culture business travelling some do, I want to explore the places. So I only have cards, as if I stumble in a wrong district and they get stolen I just call the bank and block them. While cash is lost forever. So Germany really makes it hard. Thankfully I now have some Polish cards, which I chose based on the banks that offered free ATM withdrawals kn the whole EU, so I can just go to an ATM now, but when I still only had American ones, the fees were over the top.

Anyway, I don’t want to critisize your beautiful country or anything, but it does pose a challenge to the modern tourist used to modern inventions. The lack of street view, which makes it hard to look at say a hotel or restaurant before you set out is the second such oddity. Expecially now when street view is eben in The Arab Emirates, Israel or Russia (so places which coild have security concerns).

There is no question that the Scottish economy is intrinsically linked to that of England and Wales, and that leaving would have a big negative impact.  If the UK-EU deal means that trade can carry on between the two entities, then this would off-set some of the damage.

There is no deal that would work for both the UK and the EU. The UK should just leave and face the honest bitter truth through lost jobs and the hit to the economy and investment that comes with a no deal. 

The British people don’t believe that the the EU has ever done anything positive for the UK. They’ve been told that for years in the shit British press because Murdoch hates the EU and he’s a fucking foreigner himself. 

The UK public needs to understand the be edits of EU membership, and the only way they are going to realize it is when they lose their jobs and homes and livelihoods and quality of life. Let the UK make deals with the USA and China. 

Watch the GM foods come flying in from the USA. Watch the UK get ripped on every new trade deal they try to negotiate when they realize that they don’t quite have the power, nor negotiating experience that they thought they had. Watch food prices ramp and queues for bread and other staples because at stuck in Calais.

from Wikipedia:  

[Młodzież Wszechpolska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Polish_Youth)  

The All-Polish Youth (Polish: Młodzież Wszechpolska) is a Polish youth organization based on nationalist doctrines, with a Catholic-nationalist philosophy. Its agenda declares that its aim is to raise Polish youth in a Catholic and patriotic spirit. It currently plays a major role as part of the National Movement party.  

&amp;nbsp; 
 

[Ruch Narodowy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Movement_\(Poland\))

National Movement (Polish: Ruch Narodowy), abbreviated to RN, is a political party, first formed as an electoral alliance of far-right and right-wing populist political movements in Poland, which have signed an ideological agreement, including movements National Radical Camp and the All-Polish Youth, and conservative-liberal Real Politics Union, the only political party taking part in the agreement. The party was formed after the Polish Independence March in 2012.  

&amp;nbsp;

[Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny, ONR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Radical_Camp)  

The National Radical Camp (Polish: Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny, ONR) refers to a series of far-right Polish ultranationalist organisations with fascist doctrines stemming from pre-World War II doctrines. 
The current incarnation revived in 1993 is a far-right movement in Poland. It has often been described as fascist and sometimes as neo-Nazi. As of 2012 it is registered as a common-interest association. 
The ONR considers itself an ideological descendant of the 1930s-era National Radical Camp, a fascist and antisemitic political movement which existed in the pre-World War II Second Polish Republic, an illegal Polish anti-communist, and nationalist political party formed on 14 April 1934 mostly by the youth radicals who left the National Party of the National Democracy movement. 
The Falanga National Radical Camp (Polish: Ruch Narodowo Radykalny-Falanga), RNR-Falanga or ONR-Falanga colloquially, was a minor Polish third position political grouping of the 1930s, as was National Radical Camp ABC (Polish: Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny ABC) or ONR-ABC for short following the split of the original party in 1934. ""Falanga"" is Polish for ""phalanx"", ""ABC"" refers to a newspaper printed by the organisation at the time.

The Brits on Reddit notwithstanding (very pro remain in general) I think people, including our politicians, underestimate the strength of feeling in a lot of the country. People are seething mad that brexit is being dodged by the politicians. Even May's deal is way too soft for most people, let alone a customs union etc.

It is an unusual situation where parliament no where near represents the country. Almost all politicians of all parties don't want brexit and it shows.

The Tories in particular are going to have a revolution. 75% of the Tory membership prefer a no-deal brexit from the options. It's quite a disconnect and it's this membership which decides the who stands in elections. Dominic Grieve's local party have already started the procedure to deselect him. At the next election the Tory candidate there will be a hardcore brexiter. This could happen all over the country.

It's either that or the Tory members fall in with a new party which represents their views (Farage's new vehicle perhaps).

Either way I cannot see Brexit being cancelled. It's hard to ignore 75% of your political party.

1382,"There SHOULD be certain things which should always be subject to referendum, though. We have referenda here in Ireland every time the constitution needs to be changed, and it works fine. “We have representatives” is not a good reason to encourage the public to stop engaging with policy debate. Direct democracy should be practiced whenever feasible. The only reason representatives take action without a referendum is “because voters don’t have time to vote on every little policy change, they have their own jobs to get to”. The reason a politician neglects to hold a referendum should ALWAYS be for that reason - if the reason is EVER “because the people won’t understand” or “because the people will vote wrong” then democracy is in danger.

David Cameron isn’t a fool for holding a referendum. Holding a referendum was the one correct decision he made. David Cameron is a fool for calling a referendum but not having any plan for what to do in the case of Leave winning. Just like how Theresa May is a fool for invoking Article 50 and then calling an election, but not having any plan for what to do in the case of losing seats. She’s a fool for repeatedly calling for votes on her deal without ever being sure in advance what the support would be. In politics it’s well known that you don’t call for parliament to vote on something unless you know exactly who’ll vote what. And again, she had no plan for what to do if she lost those votes. Which she did.

It’s as if the Tory Party has never heard of the idea of a “contingency plan” and simply likes to ad-lib as it goes.

Couple with the fact that voter turnouts tend to be quite low, its not hard to see how Putin is able to capture high election returns.

Except of course when they voted to trigger article 50, then triggered it and passed it as UK law for good measure. The article 50 process includes ""no deal"" as the default option with a force of law (both EU and UK).

While you are technically correct that they ""voted against no deal"" in an ""indicative"" vote that doesn't actually mean anything except express their wishes... 

The default option is still ""no deal"" by both EU and UK law. And it's arguable that the UK could even change that outcome in any way except by accepting a deal. Which they haven't done. ",,/r/europe/comments/b8gvl6/uk_parliament_never_disappoints/ejzl6ue/,WipedWithAcloth,1554250564

On one hand Germany acts as if it's the leader of the EU and we should all look to Germany on how to model ourselves in nearly every sector of society. On the other hand they have very contradictory practices that no other EU country has.

So I'll split it in half 

&gt;I clearly asked you what is wrong with Dersim..

Did i tell you Dersim is wrong? Nope, it doesn't have anything wrong but... 

&gt;why you have trouble with it being called Dersim?

It is, on legal things, called Tunceli not Dersim. You claim it as a Turkification and reject the name, meanwhile half Albanian and half Tatar guy fucking living in Turkey because what did Russia, Bulgaria and Macedonia did to my family claims it is Tunceli because government said so. 

&gt;Maybe you need to think about it harder here and start asking yourself questions. The point here is what is your trouble with calling it Dersim? What's the root cause of your issue? Don't tell me paper, because on paper it can be changed just as easily as how the original name was changed. The name change was not done in good faith.

It isn't its current name?? I don't remember saying ""Dersim is wrong"" but it isn't the name of the province, like how you said in your first comment, but its old name. 

&gt;After the Dersim genocide, any villages and towns deemed to have non-Turkish names were renamed and given Turkish names in order to suppress any non-Turkish heritage.

Like how every other country does? Do you really think it is suppression, because if it was you wouldn't be calling it Dersim. 

&gt;During the Turkish Republican era, the words Kurdistan and Kurds were banned. The Turkish government had disguised the presence of the Kurds statistically by categorizing them as Mountain Turks. 

Hello, maybe because Kurdistan has claims over Turkey and Kurds are supporting it? Like Catalonia, Kosovo, Scotland, Ireland, some Russian oblasts, Cyprus etc... 

&gt;This fake ass “democratization package” that was meant to come and change the name back to Dersim never came, so we have people like you arguing it's ""on paper"" as if that means something now days. The paper is worthless. The truth is stronger.

So it is for destroying Kurdish heritage from your pov, if we are going for it then Kurds destroyed its Anatolian heritage? What in the heck!? 

&gt;Maybe because your map is as racist as your country? However you exist now? Are you racist? You carry on the 1930's discrimination. Like I said, equality is something you don't understand.

So whole world is racist but not you? You literally said it is Dersim but not Tunceli. Very hecking nice yeah. ",All humans should be equal,/r/europe/comments/b86e3v/the_communist_party_of_turkey_won_the_elections/ejzau3c/,Usernamewhichtaken,1554242461

---

Recalling calendar difficulties, the Angolan government canceled the official visit that the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was due to make to Angola this week. But behind the scenes, it is guaranteed that the real reason was another: President João Lourenço did not want to receive one of the most xenophobic and extreme right-wing European leaders


""Timely and appropriate."" It was under these terms that, under anonymity, a prominent official from the Angolan Foreign Ministry described President João Lourenço's decision to refuse to receive the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, in Angola.

The controversial politician, one of the European leaders most connoted with the far right, had expressed a surprising interest in approaching Luanda and was expected to hold an official visit to the country this week. In detail, everything was foreseen for this Tuesday and Wednesday to be taken further steps in cooperation between the two countries.

In the Angolan capital, lobbies had been set up to carry out some operations, particularly in the economic area, in which Luanda had already been inspired by the experience of Hungary to test the first reforms under the Economic and Financial Sanitation Program.

After having relegated his relationship with Angola to the point of having closed his embassy in Luanda, he thought that the reasons that had led to the cooling of relations between the two countries had been removed.


Suddenly, however, everything changed and, at the last minute, Luanda will have given the unspoken saying, ""dropping"" a visitor that, in the eyes of some analysts, could create diplomatic embarrassment to the country.

""The President risked leaving the capital of openness to the outside world that has started, putting half a world, and above all Africa, with one foot behind Angola,"" said university professor Matias Nogueira.

To justify its retreat, freezing the coming of the head of the Hungarian Government and leader of the far-right party Fidesz, Luanda has advanced calendar issues. The celebration of the first anniversary of the Day of Liberation of Southern Africa, which brought to Angola several heads of state of the region, was one of the reasons advanced. The presence in the country of a delegation of the International Monetary Fund, as well as a meeting of the MPLA summit, were other justifications for the ""bottleneck"" of the President's agenda.

However, the Hungarians were not convinced. For example, on the same day as the traditional Viktor Orbán press conference, João Lourenço had reserved space on his agenda to grant an interview to a Russian television channel. ""Cooperation with other countries is always welcome but a visit of this nature could not fail to lead us to evaluate its repercussions at the international level, especially here in Africa,"" warned a MP from the MPLA bench.

The decision caught Budapest by surprise. The Hungarian ambassador to Angola, Zsolt Maris, even sent a note to the ""Jornal de Angola"", expressing his displeasure.

""How could Angola welcome someone who does not respect the rights of minorities and refugees, castrates press and expression freedoms and systematically attacks the independence of the courts?"" Asked a former MPLA leader who welcomes the position of João Lourenço.

Angola's decision comes at a time when President João Lourenço is accused of complying with instructions from Washington to begin a turnaround in his diplomacy. The accusations were made in a media body affiliated with the family of former President Eduardo dos Santos, according to which Luanda was recently pressured by US Deputy Secretary of State, John Sullivan, to move away from Russia and China and to recognize the self-proclaimed President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó. Instead, it would receive support from the FBI for investigations into corruption cases and would receive additional support under a $ 70 billion package that Washington proposes to make available to assist development programs in Africa.

Foreign Minister Manuel Augusto called the accusation ""hilarious"", noting that next week President João Lourenço will make his first official visit to Russia.

""Instead of detachment, let us go to Moscow, further strengthen our cooperation with an old ally,"" the Angolan diplomacy chief told Expresso. ",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/b8pmo0/angolas_presidente_joão_lourenço_cancels_visit_of/ejzb7yy/,autoclismo,1554242749

But sure, that's hard to quantify.

If the differences about how to actually do Brexit are so stark and huge, then this just invalidates the (anyways nonbinding) referendum question of ""Brexit: Yes or No?""

1580,"That wasn't really an alliance.

&gt; At the time, most European countries tried to ensure similar guarantees, and because of the Tunisian crisis, Italy found no other big potential ally than its historical enemy, Austria-Hungary, against which Italy had fought three wars in the 34 years before the first treaty signing.[b]

&gt;However, Italian public opinion remained unenthusiastic about their country's alignment with Austria-Hungary, a past enemy of Italian unification, and whose Italian populated districts in the Trentino and Istria were seen as occupied territories by Italian irredentists. In the years before World War I, many distinguished military analysts predicted that Italy would attack its supposed ally in the event of a large scale conflict. Italy's adherence to the Triple Alliance was doubted and from 1903 plans for a possible war against Rome were again maintained by the Austrian general staff.[9] Mutual suspicions led to reinforcement of the frontier and speculation in the press about a war between the two countries into the first decade of the twentieth century.[10] As late as 1911 Count Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, chief of the Austrian general staff, was advocating a military preemptive strike against Austria's supposed Italian ally.[11] This prediction was strengthened by Italy's invasion and annexation of Libya, bringing it into conflict with the German-backed Ottoman Empire.

1677,"&gt;NEW Tensions in Savudrija valley. The Slovenian fisherman with his boat destroyed 60 fishermen's net. The estimated damage is about 10 thousand kuna. Croatian fishermen told RTL that they were indignant. They do not have, they say, to whom to turn, and the incidents are getting more and more frequent. Croatian boats are peaceful. 

&gt;The nets will be thrown into the trash instead of the sea, and that's 60 pieces. For 40 years Ezio has not experienced anything like this. ""This is a Slovenian fisherman who has moved to the controversial area, and it is strange that he could not see it because the signals were visible, but then he had to boot up the net and he came back from the other side, he said he did not see him because I was he called and pulled one more, he pulled out so he totally destroyed me, ""said fisherman Ezio Kocijančić. 

&gt;Frequent practice As much as 1200 euros in the networks, it remained without catches. He fears that no one will harm him. Fishermen know who they are doing. To the owner of the Slovenian fishing boat called ""Jež"" this is a common practice. ""A couple of months ago, we were there, we worked, he passed us, hooked me and my network and started dragging us in. 

&gt;We were warning him over the cell, he did not answer,"" Marko Fusić . ""They know that we can contact us at any time, so it was still today. So far, we have already received such information from our fishermen, but in almost all cases they agreed on compensation,"" said the spokesperson for the PU of Istra Suzana Sokač. The incident is more and more ""He said that he will solve those networks. In the end, there is neither network nor anyone else,"" he told RTL Fusić. 

&gt;Police say that since the end of 2017, four applications have been received against Slovenian fishermen. Croatian say - incidents are much more. ""It seems that our fishermen do not protect us from any harm, any honor for the police who are always with us in the morning and in the afternoon and in the evening, but they do not know about these nets as it is set in the sea,"" says Enzio Kocijančić.",,/r/europe/comments/b8o4s2/slovenian_fisherman_destroys_60_nets_of_croatian/ejz0ew3/,AnaliaReborn,1554235424

The referendum was won 52% vs 48% and we're still hearing about the shenanigans that were at play during the campaign.

If voters wanted to strengthen Brexit then this would have lead to a bigger majority for May in the [2017 snap election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_Kingdom_general_election). Instead she lost her majority, which created her dependence on the DUP, further cementing the impossibility of a resolution to the Irish border question. It was Theresa May's single stated proposition for this election to give her a stronger hand in the Brexit negotiations and instead she got the opposite.

1794,"&gt; It pretty much is. The UK breaking up over the EU, only for one part to re-join? Can't think of a better message to solidify the EU than that.

Scotland would not pass the fiscal tests on its own, the Scottish economy would be a highly unstable one, whereas the UK is a very stable economy. 

&gt; Polling currently puts it a 30%, and much of that was pro-indy voters agitating for independece. It is a non-issue.

Of course it is, i await the evidence.

&gt; Not exactly. Much of the BRexit cost will be long-term. INdependence avoids this long-term loss by rejoining the EU. It's not the same as 2 problems stacked on top of each other.

Yes but there will be a lengthy period in between. For reasons i mentioned already, Scotland would not just jump back into the EU the day it voted to leave the UK. It would be that simple if Scotland left the UK while the UK was in the EU, but you will have to go through the application process,and as i said, there's no guarantee. Especially because your economy will be severely shaken. 

&gt; Even most economist aren't arguing that Scotland couldn't go independent - simply that the process would require spending and taxation changes over the medium term.

1813,"&gt;Dersim massacre didn't have such outcomes, or any intent on partial annihilation, or even had an outcome constituting a cleansing of Zazas or Alevis - while not even every ethnic cleansing would automatically means a genocide being present.

You're delusional and lack actual knowledge of history.

There were systematic killings of the population. Just because they survived and returned to reasonable numbers today that doesn't mean you can argue, well you still have a majority in the town you cant say genocide.. Lmao.. Respectfully, this is about as moronic as a Turk saying well we clearly didn't kill you all so it wasn't a genocide. No It just means you failed.

Notice you say ""massacre"" when in reality there were multiple massacres. Generally a massacre is a one time event, the massacres that take place happen over a few years, various places and all have a pattern, focused on a certain ethnic people or culture.

Two years after the supposed leaders of the independence movement the turks went to a town they renamed to ""Nazimiye"" (among others) and had preemptive plans to kidnap 2000 girls and women to various parts of Turkey in an attempt to dilute the population.  The assimilation process of the women and girls of Dersim did not end till about 1950.

Other peoples throughout the world share similar experiences and call it genocide, but when it comes to Kurds.. The slaughter of people, suppression of their culture, language, ethnicity, well that's ignored.

If you do some research you can find out a lot more than my comment. [Here's a video to start you off, from a turkish soldiers prospective of the time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylCXj8Sfujw) He talks of the mass killings and burning people alive. You don't do this to your own people. This is the glaring truth about it all.

There are accounts of throwing people off cliffs, blocking caves and burning them alive in there.

The Federation of Dersim Associations in Europe call it a genocide. I guess they're not sane either, we're all insane people just living a lie! I mean, after all these are people who study their own history and what happened to their people, get real accounts and put pieces together to see what the true intentions were back then. Don't know better than you, I guess is what you think.

Just because we survived, just because some people fled to the mountains, lived lives in the mountains and eventually returned when the turks left, that doesn't make us people that were spared, it was people that did all it took to survive.

Experts instead of calling it a genocide call it an ethnocide, simply because of attacks by Turks and threats by them, whether your their careers or life, they simply don't want to be the first to step over it.

1839,"&gt; Nobody has a right to receive a donor organ.It is a present and a second life chance.

Many people/cultures will disagree with you there. Those cultures believe healthcare is a human right and should be provided by the state (to the best of its ability of course). This includes organ donation as long as it doesn't violate other rights. So in this situation you need to argue that protecting your organs when you longer exist is a right that trumps the right to health care.

It's only a present/gift if you think that dead body parts still somehow belong to someone that no longer exists. And we already know that isn't the case legally (you can't give your body to your daughter in your will with the intention of having it stuffed and mounted).

&gt; So I prefer a system where people are forced to make a decision (negative as well as positive)

You can never have a forced decision in both directions unless there is a middle ground, for which there is not in this situation.

So you must decide. What do you value more strongly? The right to healthcare, or the right to dictate what happens to your body parts when you no longer exist.

The question was what was the most common name among the German Nationals. The statistic was right but the headline and interpretation was wrong or misleading. Everyone was so relieved that it was no foreigners. It was absurd.

Also that numbers included those who were carrying around a knife with them or the their car, for cutting the safety belt for example, or those who one an illegal knife and store it at home. So the pure numbers don't tell the whole story. It might be similar with the whole crime statistics.

Nop.

Just a simple example (no true data).

If the subway can increase its average speed from 36km/h to 40km/h, it means it can increase its coverage by 5km per hour. If every station was 2km away from each other, that would mean 18 stations per hour to 20 stations per hour, which would decrease the interval.

If the line has 5 stations, 36km/h means a 16.6(6) minutes interval, 40 km/h means a 15 minute interval.

The interval was calculated by (minutes/stations covered)\* #stations.

1976,"&gt; I find it ridiculous that the right honourable redditor would actually defend the Turkish government on the matter of the two Greek soldiers and even more ridiculous to think that they think that this was a valid reason for their actions. Taking hostages for blackmailing is what criminals do, it is certainly not what countries do. 

I didn't say it was fair, I even said it was an overkill but let's be real, both not giving coup soliders and not giving those 2 soldiers were political. Imagine Greek soldiers going for a coup, killing about 300 Greeks with jets and choppers than few of them runs to Turkey and Turkey protects them. 

&gt; Unlike Turkey, the rule of law is implemented in Greece.

Yeah, yeah, sure. You had to protect them because Turkey would kill them right? Well guess what, no coup plotters were killed after the attempt, you were wrong it seems.

&gt; seems to hide the fact that Turkey has only started disputing the sovereignty of those islands quite recently

Again, you misunderstand me, I don't talk about who is right or who is wrong, I'm saying there is a dispute and you can find many stuff about it on internet. It's your perspective, that's all. Believing what your government says without any critical thinking is wrong. So why I don't say who is right or wrong well because I know nothing about international laws considered in this dispute, you don't either. Difference is I don't believe what my government says blindly but you do. Nationalism probably.

&gt; Mr. Speaker our prime minister has no need of such antics. Turkey frequently denies its actions Mr. Speaker so the honourable redditor if I will not take their government's word for it. It is not after all the first time that a Turkish fighter jet has harassed the helicopter of the Greek prime minister. Turkey can persist on playing hide and seek all it wants, but that will not change the facts.

Again ""my government is telling the truth, yours is lying"". Why would anyone believe Greek prime ministers or random Greek newspapers word without any evidence?

&gt; Mr. Speaker concerning the matter of the Imia islets I would like to draw the attention of the honourable's redditor to the Turkish maps published before 1996 that attribute the islets to Greece. 

So why would random Greek people plants a flag to those islets? Do you Greeks randomly do that time to time?

&gt; Mr. Speaker the Turkish government seems to think that if they will create enough disputes and shout hard enough, they will somehow legitimise their baseless claims and make Greece ""negotiate"" with them on what is already ours. Therefore Mr. Speaker I am proud to say that yes, Greece is right on those issues. And Turkey is wrong when it imprisons people to blackmail a whole country, Turkey's revisionist policies are wrong and so is Turkey's constant harassment. In many cases, when there are controversies, noone is completely right or wrong. Mr. Speaker this is not one of those cases. Thank you Mr. Speaker.

Exactly. In 2017 Trump was commenting about how expensive the plane is and he said he will renegotiate the deal with Lockheed, probably to show off his deal making skills. Nothing came of it off course but he did ask Boeing for a ""counter offer"" as if Boeing could put up something to rival the F35. Anyway, after the Pentagon facepalmed at this and Lockheed shares took a small dip it all went away like so many effects of Trump's shit posts on Twitter. 

My ""joke"" was that the F35 became so overenginered and expensive exactly because every service wants a custom version for themselves. You get an Air Force normal strike plane, you get the Navy big wings and large fuel capacity plane, and you get the VTOL version for the Marines. And I just asked if after all this you want to add a fourth version, the ""export"" line specially for Turkey or other ""allies"" because this is bound to jack up the costs even more.

taken in recent years.
 Boost fiscal credibility by setting out a medium-term fiscal plan within the EU Growth and Stability Pact, aiming to steadily
 raise the primary surplus.
 Continue to pursue reforms to boost productivity including measures to improve the efficiency of the judicial system
 through improvements in administration processes and greater use of alternative dispute resolution.
 Fully implement the reforms of cooperative and of mutual banks, and complete the reform of the insolvency regime.
 Reverse the changes in early retirement rules introduced in 2019 and preserve the link between retirement age and life
 expectancy.
• Continue to improve voluntary tax compliance and avoid repeated tax amnesties. Lower the maximum threshold for cash
 payments.
 Abolish tax expenditures that are poorly targeted or have outdated objectives.
 Continue to improve coordination across tax administration agencies.
• Create, as planned, a technical support unit for public investment using existing administrative structures and ensure
it is well staffed.
 Simplify the most complex aspects of the public procurement code but protect the powers of the anticorruption
 authority.
 Develop a comprehensive public investment and spatial plan linking infrastructure developments with land use
 management.
Tax and benefits reforms to reduce poverty and encourage employment
• Implement a multi-year plan to revamp public employment services based on enforcing essential service standards and
higher investments in IT systems, profiling tools and human resources.
 Ensure capacity to administer the Citizen’s Income by building on and strengthening, where necessary, municipalities’
 social assistance services and establishing strong collaboration between them and public employment services.
 Provide more quality infant care places at a low cost relative to average wages, prioritising regions with low female
 employment.
• Reduce the labour income tax wedge on low-income workers and second earners through lowering employer social
security contributions and tax and benefit reforms, while maintaining the tax system’s progressivity.
 Lower and taper off Citizen’s Income benefits to encourage beneficiaries to seek employment in the formal sector and
 introduce an in-work benefit for low-income earners.
More effective investments in regional development and strenghthening capacity at the local level
• Rationalise and improve coordination among bodies involved in regional development policies by strengthening the role
and expertise of central government bodies.
• Empower metropolitan governance bodies with the transfer of some of the powers of regions and provinces.
• Grant to ANPAL the power to restructure public employment services that repeatedly fail to meet commonly agreed

Overall the main Warsaw libraries lost during the war about 50% of its prewar stock, which is about 1 620 000 volumins. Individual libraries have lost:
376/5000

* Central Military Library - 99% (406,000 units)

* Library of Warsaw Politechnika - 97% (129,000)

* The Sejm Library - 93% (80,000)

* The Main Judaic Library at the Great Synagogue - 90% (36 600)

* Library of Przeździecki Estate - 85% (51 000)

* Library of Zamoyski Estate - 84% (100,000)

* Public Library of the Capital City Warsaw - 72% (400,000)

It is impossible to count destroyed private libraries. The destruction begun with battle of Warsaw 1939, during occupation Germans sendmany most valuable pieces to Germany. Many libraries were destroyed during Warsaw Uprising, but the most devastating was period after Warsaw Uprising, when Germans for about three months were demolishing Warsaw, building after building. Krasiński Palace lost in those days 80,000 old prints (mostly valuable polonics from the 16th to the 18th century), 26,000 manuscripts, 2,500 incunabula, 100,000 drawings and graphics, 50,000 musical notes and theatricals, rich cartographic collections, part of catalogs and inventories. Invader was merciless in destruction of Polish heritage and history, for example two hours before leaving Warsaw, German soldiers set fire to the lower storeys of the city library magazine, where fire consumed over 300,000 volumes.

2136,"It's a simple questions, but the answer isn't quite clear cut. Actually, it's a common misconception that all Danube Swabians came from Swabia. Most of our ancestors weren't from Swabia, but from other, southern parts of today's Germany, and upper Austria. I might be wrong, but that's what I was told by a German historian. The name Swabs was falsely attributed to us, and we just went with it, similarly to the situations with 'Indians' in America. Sorry for the digression.

Anyways, I feel connected at some times, and not at the others, to Germans and Austrians from the native countries. When I visit there, I see my surname everywhere, so that makes me feel connected. It is my ""ancestral"" land, so that makes me feel connected, but, due to obvious reasons, any sort of ethnic nationalism is frowned upon in Germany to the point that they it's seems illogical to them that we still feel as Germans, and that severs that connection. However, I do feel a strong connection with Germans from other parts of Europe, like Hungary, Poland, Russia, Romania, etc., because they've went to the same shit as we did, and they know exactly what's it like to be an ethnic German and not a German citizen. Our German societies across Eastern Europe maintain good connections and cooperation. Most of us, including myself, don't speak proper German, so I am only aware of the fact that all of our dialects are different, but I am not sure how. I have never met a Transylvanian Saxon, but I am familiar with some of their customs that are the same as ours (slaughtering pigs in winter and making our own ham and sausages), and so on. Most of such traditions have died out on both sides. I think that Yugoslavian Germans were treated much worse than ethnic Germans from the other countries of the Eastern bloc, so that might explain their numbers are those success stories.

As for religion, I think you are right about the Transylvanian Saxons and definitely right about Danube Swabians. However, there is a significant percentage of protestants within the Danube Swabian community. There's still one sort of German, evangelical church left in my hometown. There's only one or two German Catholic churches left in Vojvodina, and only one church where mass is held in German, once a week.",Vojvodina,/r/europe/comments/b87gcq/the_central_european_defence_cooperation_cedc/ejxqw98/,Loravik,1554198992

The fact that the honourable redditor -much like the Turkish government- seems to connect two completely unrelated issues, the extradition of six Turkish soldiers that are accused of coup links and the imprisonment of two Greek soldiers in Turkey without charges may I remind the House again for the most part of their stay in the Turkish prisons. Unlike Turkey, the rule of law is implemented in Greece. Mr. Speaker there is judicial independence in Greece and we do not view people as a bargaining chip. I would like to remind to the honourable redditor that [Greece released the two Turkish soldiers that  crossed our borders at the same day](https://www.apnews.com/2d2cecd16952475aa00e9614bd17ef64)

Mr. Speaker the right honourable redditor seems to hide the fact that Turkey has only started disputing the sovereignty of those islands quite recently, decades after the treaties that granted them to Greece were signed. The fact that the Turkish government seems to have changed its perspective by calling islands populated by Greeks ""Turkish islands under Greek occupation"" does neither legitimise their claim nor does it illegitimatise the Greek sovereignty over those areas. Our borders have been defined by treaties and we will not stop defending them. The Turkish perspective might soon change to claiming all of the Aegean islands or even the whole Balkan peninsula as Turkish but that is of little to no importance.

Mr. Speaker our prime minister has no need of such antics. Turkey frequently denies its actions Mr. Speaker so the honourable redditor if I will not take their government's word for it. It is not after all the [first time](http://www.ekathimerini.com/227758/article/ekathimerini/news/turkish-fighter-jets-harass-tsiprass-helicopter) that a Turkish fighter jet has harassed the helicopter of the Greek prime minister. Turkey can persist on playing hide and seek all it wants, but that will not change the facts.

Mr. Speaker concerning the matter of the Imia islets I would like to draw the attention of the honourable's redditor to the Turkish maps published before 1996 that attribute the islets to Greece. 

[Exhibit A](http://www.hri.org/MFA/foreign/bilateral/moremaps/imia-tr1.jpg) 

[Exhibit B](http://www.hri.org/MFA/foreign/bilateral/moremaps/imia-tr2.jpg)

Mr. Speaker the Turkish government seems to think that if they will create enough disputes and shout hard enough, they will somehow legitimise their baseless claims and make Greece ""negotiate"" with them on what is already ours. Therefore Mr. Speaker I am proud to say that yes, Greece is right on those issues. And Turkey is wrong when it imprisons people to blackmail a whole country, Turkey's revisionist policies are wrong and so is Turkey's constant harassment. In many cases, when there are controversies, noone is completely right or wrong. Mr. Speaker this is not one of those cases.

Yeah, it's likely that we'd be stuck in the 50's.

Patents were actually invented to solve the problem of undisclosed research, where the deal was that you get a monopoly on what you discovered in return for publishing it.

After all, if all the pharmaceutical companies would have to disclose their research without getting any protection, the free market would dictate that only those companies that leech of the research of others would survive and grow while the rest will go bankrupt.

The only way to counter it would be if all research was funded by the government. But here the same applies to a degree.

The program involved a supposedly terminally ill 37-year-old woman donating a kidney to one of twenty-five people requiring a kidney transplantation. After a first selection, three people remained. Viewers were able to send advice on whom they thought she should choose to give her kidney to via text messages.

In the years leading up to the change, a number of steps was taken to inform people of the need for donors and for people to register their choice (tv-ads, mostly).

from Wikipedia:  

[Młodzież Wszechpolska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Polish_Youth)  

The All-Polish Youth (Polish: Młodzież Wszechpolska) is a Polish youth organization based on nationalist doctrines, with a Catholic-nationalist philosophy. Its agenda declares that its aim is to raise Polish youth in a Catholic and patriotic spirit. It currently plays a major role as part of the National Movement party.  

&amp;nbsp; 
 

[Ruch Narodowy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Movement_\(Poland\))

National Movement (Polish: Ruch Narodowy), abbreviated to RN, is a political party, first formed as an electoral alliance of far-right and right-wing populist political movements in Poland, which have signed an ideological agreement, including movements National Radical Camp and the All-Polish Youth, and conservative-liberal Real Politics Union, the only political party taking part in the agreement. The party was formed after the Polish Independence March in 2012.  

&amp;nbsp;

[Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny, ONR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Radical_Camp)  

The National Radical Camp (Polish: Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny, ONR) refers to a series of far-right Polish ultranationalist organisations with fascist doctrines stemming from pre-World War II doctrines. 
The current incarnation revived in 1993 is a far-right movement in Poland.[1] It has often been described as fascist and sometimes as neo-Nazi.[2][3] As of 2012 it is registered as a common-interest association. 
The ONR considers itself an ideological descendant of the 1930s-era National Radical Camp, a fascist and antisemitic political movement which existed in the pre-World War II Second Polish Republic,[5] an illegal Polish anti-communist,[6] and nationalist political party formed on 14 April 1934 mostly by the youth radicals who left the National Party of the National Democracy movement. 
The Falanga National Radical Camp (Polish: Ruch Narodowo Radykalny-Falanga), RNR-Falanga or ONR-Falanga colloquially, was a minor Polish third position political grouping of the 1930s, as was National Radical Camp ABC (Polish: Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny ABC) or ONR-ABC for short following the split of the original party in 1934. ""Falanga"" is Polish for ""phalanx"", ""ABC"" refers to a newspaper printed by the organisation at the time.

But yeah.

Czech didn't want to agree with the Munich Agreement (also because Czech nor its ally the Soviets had a say in it, weren't even invited), but after severe diplomatic pressure from the UK and France (and the threat of invasion not only from Germany, but also Poland) they yielded. Thing is Sudetenland was the prime (and actually only) anti-German defensive line Czech had, and the PM of Czech had probably foreseen that Hitler wouldn't keep his word.

In the end after Hungary and Poland had annexed 'their' parts of Czech and Slovakia declared themselves independent Germany gobbled up the rest.

Of course this didn't help either Poland or UK's Chamberlain - Poland themselves got invaded some time after the annexation of Czech by Germany, while Chamberlain was forced to quit after his handling of Hitler led to increasingly more aggressive German expansion.

Let me remind you that, while it is nice to see some change finally happening in the right honorable and very delectable Turkey, it is dangerous assign too much importance to the percentage of wealth controlled by the opposition as it moves us back into the times where the amount of wealth and property represented was thought to be more important than the amount of people represented which has been the reason why many political movements stopped short of fullfiling their promises the moment contemporary middle classes got what they wanted. 

My colleague should also note that, the good guys still don't have a majority of the votes in Turkey which makes the comparison to US somewhat misleading. Also the importance of wealth, education or other signs of social status is often used in a rather toxic manner by the Turkish opposition, belittling AKP voters which doesnt help us to fight polarization.

The full story is well described on the wiki - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Baldwin#Prime_Minister:_Third_term:_(1935%E2%80%931937).

Baldwin smartly decided to start rearming, but not aggressive enough - in 1940 the UK was still partially caught with the pants down. Issue is Labour were total idiots and wanted an total standdown, forcing Baldwin not to arm too aggressively or risk annihaliation with the next elections in favour of Labour. So you can't fully blame Baldwin for that one.

It was followed by the abdiciation crisis re Edward VIII, who wanted to marry an twice-divorced American woman who had open pro-German opinions. Baldwin succesfully pressured the king to stand down (Edward himself decided to abdicate), but he should have handled Edward more stern by giving him the clear choice of either abdicate and marry Wallis Simpson, or keep on the throne but give up on Simpson.

Churchill was exceptionally well suited to his role, using an aggressive strategy to attempt to curtail Germany.

This however in the end failed when Italy (which so far had protested against the manouevers of Germany in Austria and Czech) joined Germany and overran France. The comeback later should be something that is famous enough I guess in 1944/1945 ;)

Churchill however didn't do as well after the war - the Palestinian Mandate was getting out of control (his predecessors Baldwin and Chamberlain hadn't handled it well either, but Churchill completely ignored it during the war, with later fatal consequences when there was effectively an civil war between the Jews and the Muslims in the Mandate), the British Raj/India revolted followed by an bloody suppression which was the wrong choice (an expansion of self-determination would have probably contained the larger amount of protests, but due to the bloody suppression in the end Gandhi managed to unite the Indian people) and als in the matters of Africa and elsewhere his choices weren't the best (e.g. determining with France how the areas would be split up, ignoring tribal settlements, leading to monstrosities like the Hutti vs Tutti and Tutti vs Hutti genocides.",Gelderland (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/b83a1k/mr_speaker_representatives_of_czechoslovakia/ejx6g8d/,Seldomseenhere,1554172033

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War#Early_engagements

&gt; Dinwiddie had ordered Washington to lead a larger force to assist Trent in his work, and Washington learned of Trent's retreat while he was en route.[41] Mingo sachem Tanaghrisson had promised support to the British, so Washington continued toward Fort Duquesne and met with him. He then learned of a French scouting party in the area, so he combined Tanaghrisson's force with his own and surprised the Canadians on May 28 in what became known as the Battle of Jumonville Glen. They killed many of the Canadians, including their commanding officer Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, whose head was reportedly split open by Tanaghrisson with a tomahawk. Historian Fred Anderson suggests that Tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the British and to regain authority over his own people. They had been inclined to support the French, with whom they had long trading relationships. One of Tanaghrisson's men told Contrecoeur that Jumonville had been killed by British musket fire.[42] Historians generally consider the Battle of Jumonville Glen as the opening battle of the French and Indian War in North America, and the start of hostilities in the Ohio valley.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/b82695/mr_speaker_i_would_kindly_like_to_ask_the_house/ejx9k1u/,vokegaf,1554174673

2567,"Mr. Speaker, this is an oversimplified reduction of the issue that the [rights of Englishmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_of_Englishmen) were refused the colonies in this House:

&gt;The rights of Englishmen are the perceived traditional rights of citizens of England. In the 18th century, some of the colonists who objected to British rule in the British colonies in North America argued that their traditional[1] rights as Englishmen were being violated. The colonists wanted and expected the rights that they (or their forebears) had previously enjoyed in England: a local, representative government, with regards to judicial matters (some colonists were being sent back to England for trials) and particularly with regards to taxation.[2] Belief in these rights subsequently became a widely-accepted justification for the American Revolution.[3][4]
&gt;
&gt;The American colonies had since the 17th century been fertile ground for liberalism within the center of European political discourse.[5] However, as the ratification of the Declaration of Independence approached, the issue among the colonists of which particular rights were significant became divisive. George Mason, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, stated that ""We claim nothing but the liberty and privileges of Englishmen in the same degree, as if we had continued among our brethren in Great Britain.""[4])

https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/civilwar/overview/petition-of-right/

&gt; The crisis of 1629-60 originated in Charles I's belief that by the royal prerogative he could govern without the advice and consent of Parliament.
&gt;
&gt;This was matched by Parliament's insistence that it had a necessary role in Government, particularly in the granting of supply (tax income) to the Crown and in redressing the grievances of those ruled by the King.

-

&gt; As a precondition to granting any future taxes, in 1628 Parliament forced the King to assent to the Petition of Right. This asked for a settlement of Parliament's complaints against the King's non-parliamentary taxation and imprisonments without trial, plus the unlawfulness of martial law and forced billets. 

That is, representative government had the exclusive legitimate authority to impose taxation on Englishmen.  Deny representation, and with it, the legitimacy of the power to tax also goes away.

[Edmund Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke#American_War_of_Independence) prophetically spoke on the floor of this House on the matter.

&gt; Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your government—they will cling and grapple to you, and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance. But let it be once understood that your government may be one thing and their privileges another, that these two things may exist without any mutual relation—the cement is gone, the cohesion is loosened, and everything hastens to decay and dissolution.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/b82695/mr_speaker_i_would_kindly_like_to_ask_the_house/ejxbn03/,vokegaf,1554176630

However, as several of the right honourable members of this subreddit have alluded to, such a course of action should not be taken lightly or without a full and exhaustive examination of the consequences.

In addition, while it is within the long term balance of probability that such a separation being inevitable, a given proposal would have no guarantee of marshalling the support of a majority of the population at this time.

If, in the fullness of time, such a proposal be created that sufficiently addresses such issues as trade, currency, deficit and the broader economy as a whole then, and only then, should it be placed before the citizenship for their determination.

what you're *actually* seeing if you don't just want to cheerlead for your political party is Berlin's unemployment rates almost perfectly mirroring Germany's as a whole - only on a higher level.

Now, in 2005 at peak unemployment SPD/Schröder's reign ended and CDU/Merkel took over. Since then unemployment has fallen drastically in Berlin as in Germany. Now this isn't what you wanted to see, i get that. So maybe interpret the data as: 'The fall in unemployment since 2005 shows the SPD's *agenda 2010* (implemented between '03 and '05) starting to work and bearing fruit.'

2806,"Well why should it matter if the country is on the east of the continental plate or on the west? It’s the same continental plate, if you’re trying to use the continental plate as an exclusive geographic indicator for Europe, it is A pretty bad argument from someone who studied geography in university since even Japan is on the continental plate as well as Turkey. 

I don’t really care if you’d like to consider Morocco as European, it’d be in your own faulty prerogative. I never made the argument that closeness is a relevant factor for being in Europe so if you want to fight windmills, please do so. 

Ah I get it, you see Turkey as an invader from Asia. Fair enough I guess, but how would you categorise Bulgars and Hungarians then? They are not really part of the indigenous people of Europe either.

So what’s the difference I wonder. Historically, Ottomans have been a dominant political power in European theatre since the 15th and 16 century. Turkey still continues to be relevant to Europe even today. 

I explained your arbitrary points about geography, so if you don’t have any better based and more exclusive criteria I rather not go through it again. 
 
So finally there is culture you mentioned. It’s a really broad category, but I would love to hear your opinion between the cultural differences of Turkey and Greece. Since both McLaren and Cop in their comparative analysis of Turkish and Greek democracies don’t mention culture to be vastly different. Instead, they both make the argument that cultures are quite similar between the countries.

2895,"&gt;Well, Polish people apparently do, because the PO vs PiS dichotomy has been the main divide in Polish politics ever since the post-commies utterly collapsed 15 years ago. And the discourse between them is actually surprisingly similar to the total war between Democrats and Republicans in USA.

The actual difference between Democrats and Republicans wasn't all that big until recently, though. You won't find huge differences between someone like Jeb Bush and Bill Clinton, for example.

&gt;But you haven't provided any examples. You just mumbled something about ""press freedom decreasing"" without pointing out on what aspect was that the case. Please enlighten me what exactly changed, because as a someone living in Poland since I was born, and as an avid reader of the press from all sides of the political spectrum, I haven't noticed any difference in that regard during the last few years.

I did provide the European Commission's text on the judiciary reform, didn't I?

&gt;...freedoms such as? Which freedoms in particular they abolished? Sorry, but I don't feel any less free today than I felt 5 years ago, or a decade ago.

Well, you said yourself that you prefer the current PiS government from the PO opposition, didn't you? I'm not surprised that you don't feel any less free. I'm sure that Turks who prefer the AKP over the CHP don't feel any less free either. People usually only mind when it's *their* freedoms that are being taken away.

I do. Back in 2014, we had special services raiding the headquaters of a centrist weekly because it published recordings that shown ministers of Donald Tusk's government in a bad light. Nothing even close to that happened during the last few years.

3013,"&gt; I do think that on an ideological standpoint, though, they grew increasingly nationalist 

I would argue that supposed nationalism is greatly exaggerated. 

By mid-20s all hope for swift pan-European revolution was lost and concentrating on Soviet Union was the only pragmatic choice Communists could've done. All the ""more internationalist"" ideas that I've seen were completely unrealistic - like making ComIntern (i.e. Communist parties all around the world) directly govern Soviet Union, thus mostly replacing ability of Soviet citizens to control USSR (IIRC, that was Bordiga's brainfart).

Meanwhile, Soviet ""nationalism"" was primarily about allegiance towards USSR as bulwark of the Revolution, rather than Russia or whatever (Soviet media was quite acerbic towards Russian patriotism among White Emigration, for example).

&gt;!That said, there was some drift away from internationalism. For example, in ~1929 Stalin publicly referred to Red Army as ""the army of international proletariat"" (when describing its unique characteristics), but this phrase was stealthily removed from the reprint of his speech made after WW2 (in ~1949, IIRC).!&lt;

&gt; and that they weren't able to radically change their society as is evident by what has happened after the 90s.

Is it *truly* evident? 

First ""real"" European republic was England - it did not last and it is still monarchy today. Even Great French Revolution did not stick - France alone spend most of 19th century as monarchy of some sort. Even after WW1 similar rollbacks happened (ex. Spain). However, it is indisputable that Cromwell (and later Jacobins) *did* radically change society of their nations.

In a similar vein, we cannot rely on Perestroika and subsequent collapse as the evidence of Bolsheviks failing to radically change society (which they claimed they did by 1930s). At most this proves that they did change it *enough* (assuming it is possible to change Soviet Union in way that would completely preclude restoration of Capitalism; Marxist theory - assuming we are talking about *actual* Marxism; not the vulgar version Maoists and the like peddle - never assumed that transition between modes of production would be linear in each specific case).",World Socialist Republic,/r/europe/comments/b7q7j8/first_in_history_communists_will_govern_a/ejvpyfm/,S_T_P,1554134279

&gt;Frankly, the comments that I'm seeing in here about PiS' rule are quite similar to the ones I'm seeing from Hungarian and Turkish redditors.

What about actual situation in the country instead of empty rethoric?

But weren't we just talking about ""freedom of press""? Why change the topic?

The justice system in Poland wasn't working particularly well, so a reform was prepared. It wasn't the best reform, and so there were complaimts about its provision. The complaints were taken into account, and a new reform was prepared.

They are trying to reform a badly designed system, but their system-designing skills aren't top notch either.

3033,"It's hilarious how capitalism is blamed for the problems which it has allowed to be solved in the first place.  


World famine? Right now we are living in the age of prosperity unprecedented in human history. The poorest guy living on the streets has higher life expectancy than a king had in medieval times. The standard of living we call ""poverty line"" would be considered ""high life"" 100-200 years ago. And explain to me, how capitalism is to be blamed for starving people in countries like North Korea, Venezuela or African countries which have barely any government at all?  


Wealth inequality? Thanks for capitalism we generated any wealth to distribute in the first place. Soviet Union had much less inequality than United States - yet what Americans considered as ""poverty line"", the Soviets considered as ""average living"". So which one do you choose? Effective economy creaties inequalities. Take it or leave it.  


Ecological collapse? Dude, capitalism is the only reason we began to give a single fuck about environment. Do you think people did care about the birdies and oceans when they had to struggle every day for survival? Thanks for welfare generated by capitalism we actually started to consider ecology to be a problem at all. And guess what - the most ecological countries are those which came to prosperity in their capitalist times.  


Child labor? Basically the same as above. Throughout ENTIRE human history, the children worked their asses off to contribute even a little for their family survival. They worked on the crops, in their fathers workshops, everywhere. Capitalism actually is the only reason children could STOP working - because we generated enough wealth to actually allow us to give them some slack and send them to schools instead.  


So yeah, considering that capitalism is the main reason that we are talking to each other right now, I think you can say it works. By no means it is the perfect system but as someone once said - ""it is the best system we know of"".

Our efforts in giving vowel aid to Bosnia helped thousands of Bosnians to avoid developing apoplexy of the throat bone. And thanks to the vowels we helped to deploy, hundreds of Bosnians were able to emigrate to the Nordic countries in search of a better life.

3200,"&gt; ... I think if people didn't discuss leftism in the worst possible faith

Dude, leftists call everyone who's not equally leftist nazis, racists, sexists, etc, or claim that we actively want people to suffer.

If you don't like high taxes, it can *only* be because you want poor people to die. If you don't like open borders, it can *only* be because you're racist. If you're not a radical feminist, you *must* be a misogynist. Etc.

The left has no leg to stand on if you want to cry about bad faith arguments. 

Even your original argument was a false dilemma. You seemed to say it's either try socialism/communism *again*, or it's wage slavery and inequality forever. 

You leave absolutely no room for nuanced debate, or a third option, and then complain about how everyone else is so rigidly close-minded. 

You know the expression ""if all you've got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail?"" All the left's got are theories from the 19th century that have failed every single time they've been tried, and despite that they still act like they're tragically misunderstood geniuses. 

""If only they would read Marx or Pikkety..."" you might be thinking. Never  considering that maybe we have read them, but rejected their conclusions after doing some critical thinking. 

""No, it's all bad faith and brainwashing"" he said, brainwashed and in bad faith.

&gt; There's a lot more to government than tyranny.

At least you admit government is a source of tyranny.

3272,"Mr Speaker, 

What honorable member says isn't correct. 

CHP is left wing nationalist, by its official ideology. It's not homogenous though, but has more civic nationalist elements most of whom has Balkan, Caucasus and Crimea roots, a less nationalist faction, and a more socialistic/social democrat faction, aside from some trivial centrists/secular centre right figures recruited once for getting more centrist/centre right votes. Of course, CHP is trying to appeal to nationalist votes and right wing votes via blabbering about nationalistic issues, but things are limited to that more or less. 

Honorable member said:

&gt; The CHP is the party behind the early imposed Turkification of minorities

But that CHP and current CHP are pretty different from each other.

When it comes to Cyprus, let me point out first invasion and first occupation was legal. That's what CHP was behind. Rest has been the official state policy, no matter which party was the ruling party. The more agressive secular and nationalist and ""statist"" faction of CHP is for following the traditonal Turksih state policy when it comes to Cyprus, minus the forced mosques and tried Islamistion attempts, but that's another issue.

And Mr. Speaker, let me also say I have a huge distaste for CHP. I'm kinda sad that honorable member made me defend them. ",An Adjar born in Tuscany,/r/europe/comments/b7yubl/this_man_ekrem_imamoglu_a_social_democrat_just/ejv4l6v/,adjarteapot,1554112105

3347,"&gt; No, I mean Turkish Cypriot accents, like Paphos accent or Limassol accent.

Accent is about pronunciation only. Dialects include also grammar and vocabulary. Those are different as well in in Cypriot Turkish.


&gt; but Turks I've seen can't understand old Cypriot people talk among eaxh other. 

I also sometimes have trouble (but not _that_ much, it's a minor inconvenience if anything) understanding my elderly relatives (who are poor peasants from the most rural parts of the country), but that's mainly due to their archaic vocabulary that includes way more Persian and Arabic loanwords than normal. They were largely replaced by native Turkish words in the early-to-mid 20th century. Not to mention, their dialect I'm not that familar with (my parents speak standard Turkish) doesn't help. Cypriot Turkish most likely didn't undergo the same reforms.

Even speeches in Anatolian Turkish from the 1930s usually need subtitles.

&gt; I'm not sure about that. Same goes for German for example.

What makes a language a language, then, if mutual intelligibility and politics are not the deciding factors?

&gt; By Oghuz Turkish, I mean Turkish and its dialects. I'm calling it such, since other langauges are also Turkish from some perspectives.

Then why would you include Turkmen and other Oghuz languages that are not Anatolian Turkish? Nobody except perhaps the looniest of Turanist think the Oghuz language family is one singular language. Although the notion that Azeri and Turkish are the same language is quite common, and I tend to agree. At first it's hard to understand, but if you expose yourself to Azeri even for a few days it should be enough to understand pretty much everything. The written language is even more similar. Though Azeri seems to have way more Persian and Arabic loanwords, so that's an obstacle.

As a world pioneer in urban interventionism, the Austrian capital has been investing in social housing since 1919. As a result, 62% of Viennese people now benefit from it.

One of the first workers' housing complexes built on the initiative of the town hall in the inter-war period, in the Simmering district of Vienna (picture)

In these neoliberal times, the Austrian capital, led for a century by the Social Democrats, continues to intervene massively in the real estate sector. What would be seen elsewhere as an infringement of market laws is perceived on the banks of the Danube as an obvious fact to which we are committed. No less than 62% of the 1.8 million Viennese live in low-cost housing, whether for the working or middle classes. Anyone who has lived in the city for at least two years and earns no more than €3,317.86 net per month can claim to be part of the four ""new paint"" walls of one of the 440,000 municipal homes!

As a result, Vienna, the university capital and second largest city in the German-speaking world, has now become the main landlord on the continent. It does not intend to give in to pressure from the European Commission, which regularly accuses it of distorting competition. Compared to the Berliners, the Munichers or even the Praguers, the Viennese tenants are blessed. They spend between 300 and 750 euros per month only to find accommodation, depending on the size of their home, when they are lucky enough to meet the award criteria. However, this profusion of subsidized supply benefits everyone: by competing fiercely with developers, the municipality regulates the entire market and prevents any formation of a dangerous real estate bubble.",Alsace (France),/r/europe/comments/b7z5cq/vienna_the_realized_utopia_of_housing_for_all/ejv0t5a/,-Golvan-,1554105017
3392,"Mr Speaker, again,

The team in place is investing more and more public money in the purchase of land. ""Unlike many European cities, we have not sold our municipal housing,"" says Kathrin Gaal, the housing assistant. What is particularly important to us is the social mix in the neighbourhoods. This is not like Paris or London. It is impossible to guess the income of Viennese people according to their address. The rental contracts are not limited in time, which provides additional security for the inhabitants. »

Since the ""revolution"" started in 1919, the principle of making the richest pay by creating a specific tax to house everyone has never really been called into question, except by the fascist (1934-1938) and Nazi (1938-1945) regimes. And Vienna remains the heir to its ""red period"", those years between the two world wars that allowed 63,000 homes, still astonishingly modern, to emerge from the land with a forced march for the many damned of the conflict. For the first time, proletarians were offered private access to toilets and a bathroom. The architects designed functional units that let light in and put an end to the promiscuity that had encouraged infant mortality and tuberculosis. They were installed in vast green spaces. Passed on from generation to generation, they have not lost their appeal.

People still think that the CHP is a social democratic party forgetting that they are extreme nationalists often criticizing the AKP for being too weak on foreign policy. Their only positive thing that makes them stand out from the rest of the ultranationalist Turkish consensus is their secularism. 

Literally every party in Turkey is extreme right. The CHP is the party behind the early imposed Turkification of minorities and the invasion and on-going illegal occupation of Cyprus. 

Anyone who thinks that a change in rule in Turkey will change anything is not familiar enough with Turkish history and politics.

3481,"First, off I had a look at that Wikipedia article.

&gt;It sought to restore an independent state of Lithuania, to consolidate democracy by destroying communism in the country, returning national values and the freedom of religion. Classified as bandits by the Soviets, Lithuanians took to the forests and fought them with a gun in their hands.

This doesn't read at as something a historian would wrote but sounds incredibly biased, like a propaganda pamphlet. ""Returning freedom and religious values, destroying communism, fought only with a gun in their hand"" - what are the sources for this? Oh yes, the US State Department and the autobiography of one of the partisans who also happened to work for the CIA.

Now to the source about the ECHR, it states [here](https://m.delfi.lt/lietuvoje/article.php?id=80586003) that the court valued the partisan fighters played an important role in the protection of ""national identity, culture and national consciousness"". Sounds like these three judges confuse genocide with [Ethnocide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnocide), a contested term, and even that is speculative considering plenty of Lithuanian culture was protected and preserved. Lithuania had it's own seat in the Soviet of Nations, the second chamber of the Supreme Soviet.

The newest decision about was about a guy *who arrested two partisans*. I don't see how this is relevant. Judges are not supposed to make historical judgements anyway, they're supposed to apply the law.

&gt;That fact alone says that you are defending a country and ideology which systematically murdered people

The UK has murdered more people than the USSR on each continent but I hardly see this being brought up as an argument against capitalism or the modern UK, same can be said for every other major European power.

3598,"&gt;Compared to Poroshenko, he's much more open to ties with Russia.

Yes, but I don't think it's fair to use this to insinuate that he's pro-Russian necessarily. He's very pro-Europe and very much a supporter of the original Euromaidan. What I appreciated about his comedy was that he didn't go for cheap anti-gay shots like a lot of Russian comedians. I think he will be good for social progress in Ukraine. 

His opposition to Russian artists is completely reasonable given that he's an artist himself and has empathy for people that are pawns stuck in a larger international conflict. Art and popular media shouldn't be banned because it's from the wrong country, I mean, Christ, only commies and Nazis do that shit. 

As for his 'talks with Putin' I don't think they'll get much done, maybe he's just using that as a way to make him less controversial and more vague since it's easier to give people talks than the say he'll make war on Russia and fight Russia on a field of battle. 

EU membership is a no-brainer for Ukraine, 70% of the bright people in Ukraine are already in the EU and most other people would love to be able to go to work there as well. Even Russia sympathisers are going to be heavily tempted, it's easy to be nostalgic for USSR in thought and feelings, but much harder to say no to cold, hard cash that is represented by EU accession. The main issue is reforming Ukraine until it reaches the EU standards, not whether Ukraine wants to join EU. It's like asking if I wanna fuck Timothee Chalamet - sure, I do, but why does it matter if I don't meet his standard?

&gt; Allegedly, and again I already answered to that. They were either tarted up, fictions or cherry-picked from a precious few incidents and interpreted very charitably to the benefit of the Poles.

You clearly haven't read the accounts.   They're from Germans that  served in the campaign.  You have this idea that it was a curbstomp battle when it's simply not true.  It's sad when historians can't change their minds when presented with contradictory evidence.

&gt;in spite of the greater facts that Poland was in no position to do anything but delay the conquest of Poland.

3700,"Also, In addition to the standard Erdogan and main opposition rivalry, 

There were cities where anti-gov nationalists and pro-gov nationalists competed under their own parties IYI-MHP respectively.

 There were cities where kurdish nationalists and turkish nationalists competed. In fact formerly pro-kurd city elected a turkish nationalist and formerly nationalist city elected pro-kurd candidate. 

There were cities where main opposition competed with nationalist opposition and cities where AKP competed with their allied nationalists. 

There were cities that was a 4way race among them all with winner taking with merely 26% and there were places parties won with just 20 votes margin.

There is a province an independent won against all other parties after main opposition did not nominate him and main opposition winning one of the most conservative cities by appointing a local small bussinessman that is appearently loved.

Some hardcore kurdish fortress provinces voted erdogan and celebrated with turkish flags singing kurdish songs while akp voters attacked islamists in the central anatolia killing four.

And a commie won a province and literally every one, left to right, is happy about it.

Millions, from all sides, as if they were mobilizing for a war, volunteered, overlooked and guarded every single step of the process from ballots to headquarters. 84% turnout was criticized by some as low.

It is so weird that no one in this country gives a shit about democracy for four years except for the election day&amp;night where it is just a fucking eruption of it which is unparalleled anywhere.

Sozlu, mhp candidate and former mayor, was one of the most corrupt dudes in the country. Mhp kept him regardless because he has been financing MHP teşkilatları ( cant be bothered to translate lol) across the country with his loots from Adana. 

Iyi, has campaigned like it was a life-death matter and vouched for him to the nationalist vote block.

Antalya, the main touristic city, also a major city, has CHP as well. It belonged to CHP before, then passed over to AKP in last local elections IIRC, now CHP has it again.

ALDE is lead by Tariceanu an ex-leader of PNL(one of the two historic parties that were banned and suffered under communism) and ex-prime-minister which is doing shady stuff with PSD since 2007 if not before. His cronies' influence are in the energy and resources department and the current minister of Justice is his man.

As a fun fact, the curent EU leader of ALDE Guy Verhofstadt gave Tariceanu radio gear after the '89 revolution to make a private radio and inform the people.

3942,"&gt; I'm not making a big deal out of my sexual orientation either. Why should others?

How often did you get discriminated for being heterosexual? Insulted for being heterosexual? Physically assaulted for being heterosexual? On the other hand, homosexuality can be punished by death penalty in several countries. See the difference?

&gt; If you want to convince people that these minorities are just like anyone else, why make such a big deal out of it with all of these pride marches and such, as if they're suddenly so unique and different?

A big deal is made out of it because many people live in fear because of their sexual orientation. A big deal is made out of it because some teenagers get kicked out of their home because of their sexual orientation. A big deal is made out of it because people are scared to always be an outcast. A big deal is made out of it because people are tired to stay in the closet and not just be who they are without risks. I dream of the day where nobody will care and none of that will happen anymore. Where being gay or lesbian will be like having brown or blond hair, something that doesn't matter. It's not the case yet.

&gt; It's just ridiculous. 

From your point of view, maybe. Did you ever try to ask yourself how it feels to not be able to hold the hand of the person you love in public because of your sexual orientation? To fear doing such a harmless and normal thing? Try to walk in someone's else shoes, and maybe that what looked ridiculous to you won't anymore.

3962,"&gt;First of all it's not really a sphere of influence. America has tried and failed to pressure the EU before. 

Yet somehow, we will never turn against US no matter what they do. Where are our sanctions against them for invading and occupying a sovereign nation for 8 years?

&gt;But say we don't want this mutually beneficial alliance that is NATO. What then? The only other option I see is European sovereignty. If Europe can't protect itself, at least some of its states won't be safe. This can mean Estonia, but it can also be Cyprus or Greece. They do after all have disputes with Turkey.

European defensive alliance is the most logical option, and we would've had 30 years now to make one... Yet we continue being the useful idiots of Americans, against our own interests. We could also cooperate without any defensive alliance, or have smaller regional alliances. 

&gt;And why would Russia suddenly change overnight? Would they work towards the rule of law and joining the EU if most of its member states weren't in NATO?

Russia would also benefit from good relations and trade with Europe. I

&gt;Russia has a sphere of influence which includes Belarus and Central Asia, and which used to include Ukraine. They would not take kindly to anyone interfering with their little empire, including the states in it. Even without NATO, if Ukraine simply wanted to join the EU, I don't expect Russia would've just let them do so.

Russia is a great power, and acts accordingly. The solution is to acknowledge their geopolitical interests, and make smart politics so both sides would benefit. Something that would guarantee the sovereignty and freedom of its neighboring countries, but would also not conflict with the Russian interests. 

I don't know how, at least now in 2019, but if we had acted differently after the Cold War, the situation in Europe could be a lot better for everyone. 

&gt;The fact of the matter is, NATO is entirely defensive here. There's no way you could convince NATO to declare war on Russia. 

And Russia is not a threat because they say they are not a threat? It's irrelevant if the West claims NATO is purely a defensive alliance. It's still a potential threat in the eyes of Russia, and Russia does not want it to spread even closer to its borders.

&gt;Russia is in the wrong and they are the ones that clearly cannot be trusted. If their surrounding states look to other powers than Russia, or look out for their own interests more than those of Russia, Russia will intervene.

That's why we should have made smarter politics after the Cold War. Of course the countries that were under Soviet Union wanted to get away from Russia as much as possible after the Cold War. But that doesn't mean we have to take them part of NATO with open arms, since it's more than obvious that it's in direct conflict with the Russian interests. We should have figured out something more constructive with smarter diplomacy. We should have discarded the NATO and figured out a solution that would have benefited all of Europe.

What happens in those situations? Do we ignore countries like France and say we won't intervene militarily for their interests? If you deny countries like France the means to go abroad and enforce their agenda, they may very well pull out of an EU army and if France pulls out of the EU army that's like 1/6 to 1/3 of the army's capacity gone - potentially more when you consider after the UK leaves France will have the only aircraft carriers \*and\* nukes in the EU.

4016,"First of all it's not really a sphere of influence. America has tried and failed to pressure the EU before. Granted, that tends to be the case in areas where the EU is strong. Member states can still be exploited and even used to veto EU proposals. But this is not exclusive to the US, China and Russia are happy to do the same.

But say we don't want this mutually beneficial alliance that is NATO. What then? The only other option I see is European sovereignty. If Europe can't protect itself, at least some of its states won't be safe. This can mean Estonia, but it can also be Cyprus or Greece. They do after all have disputes with Turkey.

And why would Russia suddenly change overnight? Would they work towards the rule of law and joining the EU if most of its member states weren't in NATO?

Russia has a sphere of influence which includes Belarus and Central Asia, and which used to include Ukraine. They would not take kindly to anyone interfering with their little empire, including the states in it. Even without NATO, if Ukraine simply wanted to join the EU, I don't expect Russia would've just let them do so.

The fact of the matter is, NATO is entirely defensive here. There's no way you could convince NATO to declare war on Russia. Russia is in the wrong and they are the ones that clearly cannot be trusted. If their surrounding states look to other powers than Russia, or look out for their own interests more than those of Russia, Russia will intervene.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/b7nxzc/75_of_french_respondents_support_a_common/ejtruoz/,GalaXion24,1554062054

Of course it isn't. But pretending a country with a budget deficit of more than 10% of GDP has any other options isn't helpful.

This was Labour's last chancellor in 2010:

*Alistair Darling admitted tonight that Labour's planned cuts in public spending will be ""deeper and tougher"" than Margaret Thatcher's in the 1980s, as the country's leading experts on tax and spending warned that Britain faces ""two parliaments of pain"" to repair the black hole in the state's finances.*

*The Institute for Fiscal Studies said hefty tax rises and Whitehall spending cuts of 25% were in prospect during the six-year squeeze lasting until 2017 that would follow the chancellor's ""treading water"" budget yesterday.*

*Asked by the BBC tonight how his plans compared with Thatcher's attempts to slim the size of the state, Darling replied: ""They will be deeper and tougher – where we make the precise comparison I think is secondary to an acknowledgement that these reductions will be tough.""*

4085,"I do. I have been studying the EU as part of my bachelors for close to four years now, and have learnt to appreciate it for the unique and ambitious project that it is.

The EU is not problem free. Far from it actually. The thing is, there is no blueprint for the EU. It's discovering issues as they appear and finds a way to adapt to them, to prevent it from happening in the future.

The whole article 7 thing is a great example. The EU accounted for a situation in which a member state would derogate from proper rule of law, and created article 7 for it. Unfortunately, it didn't consider the possibility of multiple states defecting, and thus backing each other in an article 7 vote. And thus it's figuring it out as it goes.

The eurozone rules are another great example. Greece lied about their debt and deficits, which was eventually uncovered by Eurostat. In order to properly prevent this from happening, Eurostat required more powers, staff, budget etc. which the member states didn't give them. Instead only national statistics offices became more independent through a Code of Best Practices. Clearly that didn't work and 5 years later the same shit happened, after which Eurostat did get more surveillance authority.  The Greece situation is far from perfect, but it is improving.

Italy is a better case. It was about to break the Eurozone rules, against which the Commission rejected. Some political back and forth resulted and Italy did amend their deficit to be within Eurozone rules, so there it did actually work.

4148,"&gt;Yes, it was designed to provoke. But at the same time keep in mind the provocation by Serbia that was the assassination.

You're doing what you're accusing me of here, cherrypicking the evidence you preseent.

Serbia agreed to every single point of this purposefully impossible list of demands. They even agreed to discuss the one point of contention diplomatically. Wilhelm II himself even said that every cause for war falls apart and that he had confidence that Austria would resolve the crisis diplomatically.

The agressor here is clearly Austria. They could have easily solved the crisis diplomatically, and their own ally Germany even agreed that they could have done so. But instead decided to declare war over the disagreement of a single point of contention.

I also think it is important to point out that the connection between the Serbian Government and the assassination has never been fully established, let alone in 1914.

&gt;""Germany started the war"". 

If I said this I worded it poorly. What my argument has been is that the Central Powers started the war and that Germany escalated it into a World War. Austria started the war, but Germany started the war proper.

&gt;you consistently fail to realise in your thinking that there is no inevitability connecting 1919 and 1939 

What? My entire argument is that there was no inevitability. My argument is that 1939 was not inevitable and could have been prevented had Versailles been enforced as it was written, instead of the lax attitude the allies had towards enforcing it.

&gt;but such actions would not have been necessary then had the treaty been better.

You have yet to give any examples as to how the treaty would have been ""better"", which makes this argument pretty pointless at the moment.

&gt;that was a different government

The war was started by a different Austrian government from the one that signed the peace treaty, same goes for Hungary, and for the Ottoman Empire in the case of Lausanne. 

Changing regime doesn't magically absolve a state of its previous actions, not every treaty is of equal individual value. Do you think modern day Turkey is absolved of the Armenian Genocide because that was comitted by the Ottoman Empire and not Turkey? Is Japan today absolved of their warcrimes in World War II because that was under a different regime? 

These things have to be judged within the context of when they were written. If you judge Versailles in complete isolation like you seem to want, you'll get a completely inaccurate picture of why it was written the way it was.",Kingdom of France,/r/europe/comments/b7n8m9/the_kaufman_plan_a_plan_written_by_american/ejti5s0/,Anthemius_Augustus,1554055318

July 29, 1966, Hamngatan at Stångebro, Linköping. Air transport.

Fourteen J 35 The dragon must be moved from F3 in Malmslätt to the Saab field because the runways would be rebuilt on Malmen.

Easy game? No, rather an advanced military operation, organized by Captain Sven Törngren, the same pilot who was involved in the so-called Catalina business in 1952. Today he is 85 years old and remembers the great move very well.

- We moved the entire business to Saab during the rebuilding period. Why didn't we fly your plan instead? I think the boss (Colonel Olle Knutsson) wanted to try if a division could be moved through a city - and it did. In addition, it was almost more complicated to fly the plan, we had received new students and had a shortage of pilots.

The strange transport started one at night and was ready at seven in the morning. Then the big planes, drawn by jeeps and other vehicles, had thrown themselves through street crossings, across the Drottningbron and over the E4. A lot of military personnel and lots of police officers were extraordinary. Like staff from the Technical Works who screwed and welded off street signs, lanterns and refuges to immediately put them up again when the plan passed.

Everything went perfectly, neither material nor people were hurt, only the incident was when a dragon sank in an overgrown ditch on the way to the airfields from Åtvidabergsvägen. But wear and steel beams got up again.

What Sven Törngren knows is no similar transport in Sweden, sooner or later.

In 1974, F3 was dropped and Linköping lost its fleet.

4176,"Possibly. I think that'd work. Although I think we've already got EU-Battlegroups. If I remember correctly the British were the lead component of in a UK-Dutch Battlegroup. It's worth looking up actually, as I'm not sure if they're still active or not.
In the UK at least, the army is seen as an especially historic institution. Soldiers learn their Regimental battle honours, march differently dependent on regiment. Refer to Sergeants in various ways, again, dependent on regiment (Welsh &amp; Grenadier Guards say Sarn't, for example). It's an Imperial institution in many ways, in that it has managed to preserve its traditions and pomp (such as Trooping the Colour) and recruits from across the Commonwealth and Nepal (with regards to the Gurkhas). On top of this, the World Wars have given it a sanctity that no other institution (besides the National Health Service) has. Basically, everyone has or had a grandfather or great-grandfather who fought at the Somme, or Passchandaele, Gallipoli, D-Day, North Africa or Arnhem or served in the navy or air force at some point. National Service continued up until 1960, so you've got quite a few older people who have a connection with the army through that as well.
Basically, everyone has a personal link to the army, in some way or anotherso they're reluctant to see it done away with. Others dislike the idea of a pan-European army or anything similar to it because they believe it takes away from the UK's sovereignty.",,/r/europe/comments/b7nxzc/75_of_french_respondents_support_a_common/ejt6cpg/,KingoftheOrdovices,1554047340

4201,"OK, I'll admit I went too far, sorry. 

I don't deny that there is Dacian heritage in modern Romanians. But I do think that the influence is exaggerated, and that of Slavs, Greeks, Hungarians, etc. downplayed, in an attempt to produce a simple and politically convenient ""Daco-Roman"" explanation that was heavily pushed both in the early 20th Century to ""fight"" against Hungarian claims on Transylvania, and towards the end of the Communist era, to justify Ceausescu's isolationist, exceptionalist policy.

Now, as for your comment: You said the costumes /u/Canticle4Leibowitz mentioned were depicted on various ancient works of art. Which is absurd, as we have very few works (generally frescoes and mosaics) that could depict details like those geometric patterns, and the subjects are generally Roman nobility, not barbarian peasants. It seems you were referring to a *different* style of peasant clothing. And honestly, the images you showed aren't that convincing. There are superficial similarities, like the shoes, but otherwise, the peasants you linked look closer to ""modern"" peasants throughout Eastern Europe.

The video is also not convincing. I mean, they try to link even the *Cucuteni* culture to modern Romanians, which is again absurd. I don't know of any evidence of continuity between them and modern Romanians. They went extinct, for unclear reasons, millenia before we have evidence of Dacians. Moreover, similar patterns can be seen all over Eastern Europe, hence people suggesting the ones we see today are Slavic in origin.

That would be so fucking unacceptable. But in the European Parliament they have deemed that risk acceptable just because they are want to get through the voting as soon as possible.

Maybe we should just have an hour to put our vote down in the first place instead of a day. And have someone rip you out of the voting booth if you fail to cast the vote within your designated 10 second window.

&gt;Undermines NATO

How? 

&gt;Nobody knows who would in command and to whom that army would answer to

It's a theoretical idea nowhere near to being implemented yet. I imagine it would answer to the European Council and only on unanimous terms. Over time, I imagine that the unanimous would be reduced to QMV as we have seen with all aspects of EU affairs other than taxation (yet)

&gt;Would we finance the force that would take away our sovereignty at some point

This sovereignty argument is a bit of a red herring to me. The unfortunate reality is that our sovereignty is already fading: EU or not. Sovereignty is the ability of a state to chart its own path: how can a state do that in an increasingly interdependent world where even being a member of an international organisation is an attack on ones sovereignty. Where a state has to adopt certain trade policies to attract investment? Where a smaller state has to suck up to the big ones to avoid becoming a target? Where is the sovereignty in that. To the contrary, I would argue that a united Europe is strengthening sovereignty. It is making Europe sovereign. No more weak, no longer walked over. Respected once again. A strong Europe that stands united in the face of increasing threats to global stability. That is sovereignty: not a bunch of small states easily walked over by larger powers like Russia, the United States, or the People's Republic of China

&gt;It also diverts focus and resources from real needs like the army that will actually defend your own country.

True. It does, in part. It diverts focus and resources instead to a supranational Union that has the interests of all its members at heart. A Union that will actually defend the sovereignty of all European states in the EU. How can little Lithuania hope to defend its self against a state like Russia? It has no chance if it is isolated. A European army to defend European territory would enhance sovereignty and security, not weaken it

&gt;All in all it seems a ploy to concentrate European military spending in France and Germany while amassing more power by EU bureaucracy.

Its an attempt to concentrate European military spending in the European Union. The European Union of 28 member states, not just France and Germany.

If the point of this article was to teach history, to be truthful then why didn't it mention the 100,000's tonnes of allied shipping sank by the Japanese Navy and airforce in the bay of bengal?

&gt;During the first six months of 1943 these attacks lost the Allies and neutrals more than 2.1 million tons of shipping. In the Indian Ocean alone from January 1942 to May 1943, the Axis powers sank 230 British and Allied merchant ships totaling 873,000 tons, in other words, a substantial boat every other day.104 British hesitation to allocate shipping concerned not only potential diversion of shipping from other war-related needs but also the prospect of losing the shipping to attacks without actually helping India at all.

4415,"This turned out longer than expected but hey, maybe it helps. Apologies for not offering a tl;dr.

**1)** ""Not guilty"" verdict on a specific issue is something different than being absolved of any and all wrongdoing in this context. 

As a prime example, take the banning of the [German NPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Party_of_Germany#2016_banning_attempt). The courts rejected this, the party is still allowed to exist. That doesn't mean they're not unconstitutional, but the courts put the bar at ""unconstitutional *and* able to put that into action"", which is what earned them the ""not guilty"" in the end.


**2)** The Identitarians in Austria were accused of a) forming a criminal organisation and b) *Verhetzung*, which requires advocating for violence or strongly violating human dignity.

a) Was called a bullshit charge by pretty much everyone involved. To quote the judge: 
&gt;„Wenn eine Organisation im Kernbereich legale Tätigkeiten ausübt, ist es keine kriminelle Vereinigung, auch wenn sich daraus Straftaten ergeben“

""If an organisation engages in legal activity at their core they're not a criminal organisation, even if they commit crimes.""

That leaves us with charge b): This is where they got off because of technicalities. Those *matter*, but they're still technicalities. E.g. the slogan ""Erdogan, take your Turks back"" can be interpreted as people wanting Erdogan to take all ethnically in some form Turkish people back (illegal, but likely what was intended) or to take AKP supporters back (""his"" Turks, legal and what the defense argued).

Especially because some of the charges were rather fluffy, the court sided with the defenders. This isn't bad per se, but it needs to be noted that all counts played out like this. Groups such as the Identitarians are very careful to push ambiguous messages that they can wiggle out of, that's *by design*.

Some were **still** sentenced for e.g. damaging property and violent conduct and they're **still** under surveillance for being anti-democratic organizations in both Germany and Austria.

The verdict means exactly what it says: ""Not guilty on these charges. Other/more specific issues? None of our business, up to the state &amp; prosecutors.""",Germany,/r/europe/comments/b7kueb/austrian_farright_extremist_denied_us_travel/ejsrhgg/,rEvolutionTU,1554033235

4614,"&gt; Ahhh yes, it was all the Polish. Despite no poles working on the enigma machines when the Germans changed them in 1943 and we saw a huge spike in American deaths in the atlantic...only for the UK to break them again. But lets pretend it was all Poland.

Poles were excluded for the work on enigma once they delivered the machine. They continued the work in France which actually broke more of the transmissions than the B. Park.

&gt; No they were not, they played a part, instrumental, no. You can't say without Poland we wouldn't have won the Battle of Britain...because we most likely still would have

Likely, perhaps. Maybe. You'll never know. 

&gt; So the small poorly equipped British military should have gone over there shall they? It seems you wish to belittle the Uk for not having a military


But that same poorly equipped army somehow saved Europe a  few years later? All on its own while using mostly foreign troops, and we should be now grateful?

&gt; Lol, i literally read 2-3 ww2 books per year, I have even travelled Europe just looking at ww2 sites, Auschwitz, the birds next in Bavaria, Hitler's birthplace, Berlin...reichstag, bunker, etc. Anne Frank's house, 101st airborne path through france, belgium etc (big band of brothers fan), d-day landing sites. Literally took a whole month off work 8 years ago to go through all the major sites I wanted to visit.

It's a good start.

&gt; Churchill had warned us too, years before...but was ignored, the same as every other country ignored the warnigns...france, usa, etc. Politicians in the UK just called him a war-monger.

So in the end you agree Britain fucked up.

&gt; So it's britains fault that Hitler emerged...no other country in Europe's. Maybe if Poland wern't such pussies they wouldn't have been rolled over in a week.


Poland was too weak to hit Hitler before he could inflict the damage that he did. So Poland asks for help, Help is refused. Tens of millions of innocent people are killed. Britain claims the white horse.

The reason why Poland after WW2 is homogenous is not because people wanted that but because the Polish state was *reconstituted* as ethnically Polish because the communists knew from Soviet experience that when push comes to shove people will rally around a nationalist ideology.

So Poland was *designed* as an ethnically homogenous state  so that it could be ruled as part of the Soviet empire.

4624,"I was going to add this comment in response to someone else's comment about Poland and Germany, but they deleted it. Anyway, I typed it out so I don't want to waste it. Sorry if it lacks context.

Polish products seem to be increasingly common in Canada. Oftentimes they are cheaper than other brands, but of equal or even superior quality. I frequently buy Polish chocolate and sauerkraut, for example. I don't really know a good batch of sauerkraut from a bad one, but it tastes good to me. As for the chocolate, it's super cheap but seriously good. I've got a can of borsch in my cupboard too, but have not tried it yet, actually I've never had borsch before. However, despite there being many European beers here, Polish beers are not too common. One can buy them, but typically as individual bottles, so buying one for a treat is ok, but not as a regular beverage because single bottles are too expensive. That said, I'll often pay more (within reason) to purchase a product produced in a country that cares about its identity. For example, I bought shaving cream today that was Made in Poland, which was about $1 more than Gillette, but fuck them. Although every category cannot always win, I try to balance this factor (i.e. nationalistic countries) with price, quality, buying Canadian products, and respect for the environment via packaging and shipping distance.

WARSAW, Poland — Poland’s right-wing leaders have hinted they will not implement fully the European Union’s copyright reform, saying it stifles freedom of speech.

Ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said Saturday that a copyright directive adopted by EU lawmakers this week, to be implemented by the 28 member nations, threatens freedom.

Proponents say it ensures that authors and artists are paid; the Polish government says the rules will ban the linking of information and memes.

Without specifying, Kaczynski said the Law and Justice party will implement it “in a way that will preserve freedom.”

His words at the euroskeptic party’s campaign convention ahead of the European Parliament elections in May were apparently aimed at attracting young voters, and countering claims that the party’s policies are curbing free speech and ideas.

4668,"Since new movements are largely excluded from the political process due to the two-party systems, dissent can only express itself by inner-party dissension, as the Labor Minister/MPs who opposed the Iraq war or the Tory dissent of the ERG, which is a party within the party. This reduces transparency in the democratic process.

Different from the Brexit debate, there was cross-party support for the Iraq invasion. We can expect the bulk of the Tory party to support neocon policies, but that Labor was the driving force in this adventure was a shock. This was largely the personal ""achievement"" of Tony Blair, which has haunted Labor ever since. 

This chimes in with what I said earlier. The two parties in this duopoly both support the same neoliberal and neocon policies. This generated the ""discontent"" with the ""establishment,"" and the frustration about the lack of a political alternative. Oddly enough, even Farage, who belongs to the nationalistic spectrum that would normally support military interventions, uses the bombing of Libya as argument against ""the establishment"". Just like Trump tries to exploit the Iraq invasion to denounce the ""establishment"" represented by Hilary. That Trump is just as dishonest in this as Farage, is shown by his appointment of Bolton who defends the Iraq invasion even today.

In conclusion, no matter what its relation to the empire or imperialistic policies, the two-party system has polarized society and prevents center politics and a social consensus to heal the divide. Instead of working for the greater good of the country, politicians exhausts their energy for party politics or for personal ambitions.

On its own, the UK was a rather weak country compared to Germany. If Hitler attacked the UK instead of Poland, and then the USSR, the UK would stand zero chances. UK's land forces at the time were about as big as those of Czechoslovakia, which the UK incidentally sold out the Hitler.


Proof of UK's weakness at the time?
Dunkirk. 

The combined forces of the UK and France were mauled while the Germans were using their good hand on the Eastern front. ",,/r/europe/comments/b7kgo4/churchills_policies_to_blame_for_millions_of/ejsgafy/,sektabox,1554013678

Also, it's talked about because it's about representation. When you grow up gay (like myself) and you grow up in a country where you are represented by a number of extremely effeminate men (which, I have no issues with) and where you are hated for something you have no control over, it's nice to see a positive gay role model.

All of your arguments are the exact reasons Brexit happened.  Having a second chance to let the actual people who actually have to live with the results of this is not 'the EUs way' of saying anything.  The EU don't call for British referendums you fuckwit. 

Do you know how many times Ireland voted for the Lisbon agreement?  Three.  Three fucking times.  Why?  Because it was obvious that the lies and mis-information had contaminated the voting process.  The people voting over and over is never un-democratic.  That's just people making up their minds over and over.

What *is* anti-democracy is telling the people that despite the total clusterfuck this whole thing has become, despite the fact that you were lied to by Farage and Johnson and the shower of fucking muppets that support them, despite the overwhelming outcry, you are not allowed to vote again.  Meanwhile, the government can try to push it's idiotic exit plan through parliament as many times as possible.

Stop being stupid.  Go outside and read some newspapers that don't use 400 point font on their front page.  Go look for actual research on the effects of Britain leaving the EU.

I think it's because the Tory ruling class, and a lot of Labour as well, come from a very select group of people.

About 40% of the UK's prime ministers come from just one high school: Eton.

It's understandable that the large majority come from Oxbridge since it's to be expected that the PM's would tend to come from the top universities, but this is a school for boys.

To use an example from my country Morocco. There was a famous Dutch Politician, Geert Wilders, leader of the 2nd largest party. He called Moroccans rats and thugs and promised to kick out all Moroccans. Despite being insulted, our King did nothing. He did not condemn the racism, he did not ask the Dutch to do something. He did nothing. 

But when one of Erdogan's Ministers tried going to the Netherlands to meet with Turks and was stopped. Erdogan stood up and called the Dutch Nazis.

While to many Europeans this is really stupid , in Morocco most people cheered and celebrated this. Yes Erdogan was acting like a child but for Moroccans to see a Muslim leader actually stand up to Europe was amazing and heroic. 

Our biggest political party was even formed by politicians inspired by Erdogan and what they see as his courage to stand up for Turkey.

5064,"&gt; People decided to vote for an unknown, inexperienced person just because they hate the government 

I voted for her and also agree with this. I also agree with that Sefcovic is a great diplomat with years of experience and I believe that would probably make him a better president. Profesionally.

I also watched every single pre election debate. I also watched Sefcovic repeat the same bullshit and avoid the same questions over and over again. I also watched Sefcovic transform and lie on television just to get the votes of far right and conservatives.

I didn't see anything like this from Caputova. She was the same person, honest person, never avoided any question, never attacked her oponent, never tried to pick on any bullshit about him. That made her more believable for me and probably for the rest of her voters. I'm tired of whataboutism. People have enough of attacks, arguing and being rude to each other. That's what Sefcovic did and Caputova didn't. And I also believe Sefcovic didn't like it. I'm pretty sure he didn't enjoy being in that position. I'm pretty sure he would much prefer to be in EU parliament and not deal with this SMER-SD bullshit strategy that could ruin his career. That's the reason why Lajcak didn't want to run with support of SMER. Anyone who watches and reads about the campaign knows Sefcovic isn't really like he wanted to present himself in this campaign.

He would make a great president, but he would have much higher chances if he would decouple himself from Fico and his shitty party.

5175,"From your comment telling me how terrible diversity is and how it has been harming Canada's values etc etc. Feel free to reread it.

That doesn't make the EU undemocratic or mean that citizens don't have input. I don't even understand where you get that view point from. Parliamentary systems across the world do not have to be identical in order to be representative.

The great thing about the EU on top of all of this is how much it invests in participation. The Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee exist to gather input on EU initiatives from local governments and civil society. Furthermore, the Commission conducts surveys itself in order to gauage support for proposals. A recent example is the survey on whether summertime should be abolished.

Because the EU is so large, it can really invest in research to inform its policy, harmonise national initiatives so that money isn't spent twice on the same thing in two different countries, and represent states that would have comparatively little power internationally as a combined force. The EU also acts as a safeguard of the rule of law, democracy and democratic values in Europe and is able to interfere if European countries try to compromise their own democracies or, say, revert to the death penalty.

No one is saying the EU is perfect. However, it is the best thing we have managed to do so far. The youngest generation today was born into a Europe that has been at peace for over three generations (the luxury almost no generation has had before it) and is more prosperous than it ever was. This is a great privilege.

[http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/Chart/index](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/Chart/index)

Support for EU has grown a bit recently. There was a drop during the Euro-Crisis and during the Migration thing, but it has recovered recently. And it would not suprise me if Brexit had helped a bit.

And of course support varies country by country. Some countries have a more nationalist mentality than others. And some countries might have current problems they blame the EU for. But it's not so important if single countries have a negative stance at the moment. It's  more important that the broad majority supports the EU.

&gt;Anyways in general I don't think we disagree on much, just have different priorities. I don't think that the EU is the reason why there is peace in Euorpe as correlation does not equal causation.

Well, Europe has a terrible history of conflicts based on insane nationalism. The EU might not be the only reason to keep peace, but it helps a lot: Without EU there is no common democratic institution and finally everything depends on the good-will of the national governments. We even have the problem \*with\* the EU: The major legislative in the EU is the council: The ""club"" of the national ministers. Governments are elected nationally and their primary responsibility is to push national interests. They might be aware of the fact that ""we first"" is not helpful, but they might fear the voters reaction if they think too European (National idenity politics over rational politics). But the EU defines many basic rights and duties of members, so this cannot go too far. 

&gt;That doesn't mean it hasn't played a role, but the development of nuclear weapons, and NATO have probably played a larger role in curtaling large scale conflicts. 

Of course that played a role. But conflicts are not just about military conflicts. Just think about trade-wars, protectionsism and such stuff. A war is just the maximum of escalation of lack of cooperation.

5255,"The German, French and Italians don't get to dictate anything. That is exactly the point I have been trying to convey all along. In order for a country to join the EU, it has to also be a member of the Council of Europe and to agree to various other conditions of the EU, such as financial policies and human rights etc etc. The Council of Europe is not an EU institution and any country can join it. Its purpose (roughly) is to promote human rights and democracy and in order to be a member of the Council of Europe, a country has to abolish the death penalty amongst many things.

Therefore, if a country wants to reinstitute the death penalty, it is violating its membership of the Council of Europe and thereby violating the terms of its membership of the European Union. In such situations, the EU can take recourse against member countries. I repeat, this is not dictated by Germany or such but a direct result of a member country violating an agreement it has entered into.

The monarchies of Europe, as far as I am aware, are not in any way threatened by the EU. In the UK for example, the Queen has continued to be the head of state without issues or interference from the EU. If the UK wanted to fully revert to a monarchy (i.e. abolish parliament or something) AND retain its EU membership, that might pose problems because by doing so it might actually breach the terms of EU membership. There would likely be consequences but even IF, no steps would be taken without a majority (if not all remaining) member states agreeing to take action.

Therefore, I hope you can see that no country dictates to anyone and neither does the EU. EU membership is voluntary and highly lucrative. All countries joined voluntarily. If the terms of the EU membership no longer suit them, they can also leave. However, if countries do not respect their own commitments, the EU is fairly unique internationally in being able to enforce compliance of its treaties.

Police are investigating the vehicle, which authorities said was an Opel Astra compact car. **Prosecutors added they have yet to find a connection between the incident in Essen and the raids.**

So the raids happened because somebody speeded through a pedestrian zone in Essen, but the police have yet to find anything connecting the Essen incident to the raids? How does that make any sense?

It should also be noted that German police loves to label all kinds of things as terrorism, at least as long as it involves brown people/Muslims.

The data the program used to make its selection includes quarterly real GDP and other economic indicators, such as inflation and the size of different economic sectors, starting in the first quarter of 2009. Once the doppelgänger has been selected, we can chart how it compares to the real UK, both before and after the referendum. [(More information about the method we use is available here.](https://www.cer.eu/insights/cost-brexit-june-2018))

5423,"This is legacy of good ol' Yugoslav days.

Back then it took a lot of time and money in order to build a legal house. You couldn't build any type of house - there were strict regulations when it came to number of floors and outside look.

Most people simply decided to ignore the law, buy a piece of land, gather their neighbors, family members and some day laborers and build a house on their own terms. Very often they would run out of money and couldn't complete the entire house and ended up with [this](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%92%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0/@44.7530707,20.5572474,3a,48.9y,13.67h,96.79t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sf2QHirJAeqsbcucwXszJhg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x475a7705f3741165:0x5c64d63984be627e!8m2!3d44.7527689!4d20.5570001?hl=sr).  

New governments couldn't wreck those houses because it would cause a major outrage. Most people had nowhere else to live and social housing is non-existent in majority of former Yugoslavia. Instead governments opted for ""legalization"" of illegal buildings. Nevertheless, you still have to pay taxes and utilities even if your house is not fully legal.

That is **exactly** how segregation happens. You tell people they don't belong and guess what? They won't feel like belonging and thus reach out to peers who make them feel like belonging. ""Aus der Not eine Tugend machen"" is an extremely big factor with this.

Are there people who don't want to integrate and prefer to stick to their own little bubble? Sure, those also exist, but framing it as an issue of that, and **only** that is an extreme oversimplification of the issue for the sake of putting all the blame on one party and that party alone.

&gt; Immigrants choose to rent a house in a neighborhood full of immigrants, most of their friends are from the same background, they are slow or unwilling to abandon practices and beliefs that are totally unacceptable in Europe as FGM, forced marriages, women inferiority etc.

Sure, because everybody is completely free in choosing where they want to rent a house/flat. It's not like things like distance from work, nearby school/kindergarten options, how high the rent is and a myriad of other things factor in that decision. It's all because ""immigrants only look for other immigrants"", and that's it.

Maybe you should try spending some time with those people, in the districts where they live, then you will quickly realize many of them would love to live in a better neighborhood, but the reality is that most of these better neighborhoods are too expensive and even the ""worse neighborhoods"" start to outprice many people, as gentrification is a steadily on-going process in most urban centers.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/b79gat/germany_police_arrest_10_suspected_terrorists/ejqp8bw/,Nethlem,1553962307

Those plans got cut down to 48. UK wanted to buy more, but there isn't any actual plan or funding attached, which fits a pattern with many countries that stopped buying after the rises in cost.

And 48 are, if you consider how many have to be in maintenance, training, etc at the same time, too few to be an effective force.

&gt;As for personnel, having a large standing army is pretty worthless in modern warfare. What matters is combat readiness. And in that regard, I think the UK is far ahead too. In a war on foreign soil, the UK would be ready to field a far larger and better equipped army than Germany can.

There's also political meddling. For example, the left in Sweden forbade all research into nuclear technology between 1986 and 2006. They also added a flat 30% tax on the cost of electricity generated by nuclear power plants. In 2016, it was agreed to remove this extra tax by 2019.  


Meanwhile, renewables are heavily subsidized and so don't carry their real cost, especially if we consider the investments needed if you want intermittent power sources like wind and solar.

I get what you're saying, but this situation would only be analogous if the UK had nothing to offer the EU.

If you've heard the saying ""If you owe the bank $10 000, that's your problem, if you owe the bank $10 million dollars, that's the banks problem""

The EU does a lot of trade with Britain, especially Germany's automotive sector. They can't risk have trade tariffs on those exports as they're too lucrative. If the UK implodes certain EU countries that have a positive balance of trade exporting to the UK will feel the pain as well since the UK is a net importer of goods, other countries rely on the UK importing their goods.

For sources [here's](https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/exports-to-united-kingdom) the UKs trade deficit in general, last year was about 3.83 billion GBP, or about 4.45 billion euros. [here](https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/deu/) shows Germany's exports, large part is automotive or various mechanical/electrical parts.

This [here](https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/gbr/) shows the UKs import/export top countries. The top import sources are:

&gt; The top import origins are Germany ($90.3B), China ($58.9B), the Netherlands ($47B), the United States ($46.6B) and France ($36B).

5563,"&gt;Also, you could just have researched whatever article you want about placebo effect on animals, like this one

From your article:

&gt;This placebo effect appears to be **an instance of simple Pavlovian conditioning.**

So that means it's not placebo but a learned pavlovian reflex.

Do you even bother to read the stuff you're linking, or is your ego too big to understand?

Menawhile, research has conclusively disproven any placebo effect by homeopathy in animals.,

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5738588/

&gt;In human medicine, there may be a place for the counselling/psychotherapeutic aspects of homeopathic consults and the placebo effects generated by homeopathic products in patients who believe in such treatments, but in veterinary medicine these factors are unlikely to benefit patients, and **the use of homeopathic products in veterinary medicine is contrary to best evidence, irrational, and inconsistent with current scientific and medical knowledge**",European Union,/r/europe/comments/b798qh/french_healthcare_system_should_not_fund/ejqewa4/,Canal_Volphied,1553954879
5564,"&gt;The EU does a lot of trade with Britain, especially Germany's automotive sector. They can't risk having trade tariffs on those exports as they're too lucrative. If the UK implodes certain EU countries that have a positive balance of trade exporting to the UK will feel the pain as well since the UK is a net importer of goods, other countries rely on the UK importing their goods.

No. And and that's something the UK obviously also thinks. The point is: Nobody is happy about Brexit and a hard brexit also damages the EU. But: EU also needs to keep the integrity of the EU intact  (including the market). The UK cannot expect that it get's rights of EEA-Members if it does not also take obligations of EEA-Members.

I think one problem in the negotations now is that UK often has got special privileges and exceptions \*because\* of it's size and importance - but this cherrypicking has also annoyed other members. The UK has been so used to it, that they thought it will be easy to get a great deal for them because they followed the mindset ""The EU needs us more then we need the EU"". But this is nonsense. The UK leaving the EU without deal hurts the EU, but it hurts the UK even more. So the stance is: The best deal is membership - feel free to leave, but do not expect to have the same privileges of as a member - and do not expect to get any privilege of a member if you are not willing to follow duties of a member. 

Political and market integrity is at the moment way more important than the (in comparision) loss of exports. 

Sooner or later there will be some kind of free-trade-agreement. But it just cannot work, that the UK says ""We want to be in the customs union - but not be in the customs union (IOW: have our own trade deals).

For a case like yours there's likely dozens of cases where people want ""just something to sleep better"" without any need for some type of ""real"", usually prescribed, sleeping pill.

For cases like these (where placebo effect alone might be enough) having these things available is a good thing, if they achieve the desired goal: Making the person feel better and helping them fix their current issue.

Obviously that should both be combined with clear disclaimers *and* the clear advice to visit a doctor if the issue persists/gets worse but I don't think a blanket ban would magically make people healthier or more likely to pick more practically useful options.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;. I am an EU migrant in Australia.

&amp;#x200B;

What a weird way to phrase it. Australia doesn't have an EU immigration policy, it discriminates from state to state. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Our qualifications were not recognised and we still had to find work.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, of course you needed to find work. Qualifications were not recognised by who? The Australian Home Office? Then you wouldn't have been been able to look for legal work anyway. Employers? Then what the hell were you doing moving across the world without a confirmed job position? Setting up a business? They are very transparent with their requirements. My father went through that process. It's tough, but very much doable. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;My qualifications are automatically recognised

&amp;#x200B;

This is a moot point. Within the EU the only people 'recognising your qualifications' are employers. You seem to have misunderstood. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Also you’re not fully explaining the freedom of movement. That only applies if you have a job within 3 months, or contractual employment beyond 3 months, or can prove sufficient income. Which, guess what, is actually not that special. Many countries around the world have similar requirements. What the EU says is that in Germany, one must not give priority to Germans over a Belgian or a Romanian. Which isn’t as groundbreaking as you seem to think. If you’re moving to a place, you’re going to be retiring, working or studying.

&amp;#x200B;

To elaborate on this, when one migrates to Australia, your employer needs to prove that they can't hire a native Australian to fill the position, or that it would be detrimental. The state would allow perhaps a certain proportion of migrant workers over a certain period. This is standard all across the world. In the EU, it just expands 'I can't find a native in Germany/France/etc.' to 'I can't find an EU citizen'. You still need work, you're just on a level playing field as other EU members.

Now the deal should be quashed there might be more support for plans in the votes come Monday. They're also debating the petition in the Commons on Monday but I don't know for certain about the timetable or whether it's been shunted along. That's just what it said in the email. 

They can still just say fuck it and cancel Article 50 but it won't happen.

Meanwhile, having an involved uncle, grandfather or even family friend can be the necessary influence on a child. I'm using male rolemodels here because AFAIK the vast majority of same-sex parents are lesbians who raise their own children. People just like the imagery of two gay guys adopting a baby and being helpless because ""lul men raising babby that's funny men don't raise babby"". In fact, it's been thought for a while that same-sex couples often provide a better environment because they're usually involved in a community of friends of both genders that contribute resources and time, while opposite-sex couples, being more common and statistically less well-off, are often just left to fend for their own and thought they'll just figure things out.
