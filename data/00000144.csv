29,"&gt; Well, I make 50K a year, certainly not in the top 10%. I have great healthcare with great insurance.

Great healthcare by which standards? And how much do you pay out-of-pocket for that?

&gt;The hospitals I go to have bleeding edge technology with extremely low wait times.

And I'm sure it's cheap as .. and if you get *really* sick, so sick you can't work for a long time, then I'm sure your insurance &amp; employer will be generous and just keep paying ... amirite?

&gt;I can call about twenty different clinics this very second and have an appointment today to go see a doctor.

Great, me too.

&gt;My spending is capped at 5K a year, but most of the time I pay 10$ for a doctor's visit and my prescriptions are all about 10$ as well.

And here comes the BS. $50k/year with one of the 1% absolute top plans on the market that costs you practically nothing at all.

If only this utopia were true for any significant amount of Americans.

What a generous insurance you have there ... sounds like a non-profit

&gt;I went to a great university to get my B.S. in Biochemistry, and I only had about 10K in debt due to the federal grants we have for lower income students. I could have had no debt, my classes were all paid for, I just wanted some spending money. Even with a daughter and all the bills I pay, I have a 2016 model car and a comfortable life. Is that good enough?

Fantastic, despite everything that is shit in your society, you are one of the few that made it up the social mobility ladder - something the US ranks abysmally in.

My education was 100% free (from my POV at the time), not only that, I actually received around $900/month to study.

My healthcare is also 100% free. Literally $0 co-pay. If I'm unemployed for 10 years and get sick, I'm still covered. If I get cancer and can't work for 2 years ... I'm still covered.

Not only that, I feel fucking great because my neighbor, and all my other fellow man are also covered, no matter what. I don't have to rely on having some miracle plan that 99% of other people can't get - that's not a successful society at all.

You're judging your nation by how the fortunate have it, but you should be looking at how your society treats the least fortunate. #1 in child poverty among peer nations, #1 among bankruptcy, #1 at people in prison, #1 in general poverty ... absolute failures

Sure, you have a nice car and were lucky to land in circumstances that allowed you to climb out of poverty, but the vast majority don't.

&gt;Yes, the US has some problems, but this idea that anyone who isn't a lawyer, doctor, or engineer lives a rough 3rd world life is just ridiculous. I came from a lower-middle class family, certainly not from money, and my life has turned out fine.

So far ... you're still in the younger segment of society. You haven't been so unlucky as to catch a bad disease, or a car accident, or whatever else puts your daughter in a complete shit situation.

When 45 million Americans live in poverty, and if we use my countries standard of poverty it's more like 70-80 million, then you're not doing that great ... especially considering how much more wealth you actually have than practically everybody else.

Your pie is larger, but you can't even manage to provide slices for those in the bottom, even though poorer nations can. It's shameful.",,/r/europe/comments/czpyps/un_budget_who_has_paid_their_dues/ez8ejtf/,upvotesthenrages,1567741122

51,"It's true I cannot make a direct comparison to European healthcare as I have not experienced it, but from everything I read on subs about the UK, Ireland, etc... I would venture to guess my healthcare is probably better than the vast majority of Europeans.  People forget that the massive amount of money in American healthcare often pays for innovative technology.  From recent statistics, nearly 50% of biomedical devices originate in the US.  My friend just had a baby, and his wife's room looked like a fancy hotel room.  Providers here have to compete for customers, so we receive a lot more focus on things to satisfy the patient.  This can also lead to problems, as this approach is partly why so many doctors were prescribing opioids, but overall my healthcare has been excellent.  I do have a chronic kidney disease and I've had five shoulder surgeries, so I have had to utilize it quite a bit.  

Yes, if I lose my job I lose my healthcare.  I would rather we had universal healthcare, but I was responding to the claim that 90% of Americans live rough lives, I was not analyzing every merit of each system.  What annoys me is that Europeans act like there are *no merits* to the US system.  You know what I never have to do?  Wait a year for a shoulder surgery.  I also never have to call at 8 A.M. sharp just for a chance to see a doctor like so many in the UK talk about.  

I have blue cross blue shield, one of the better plans,  but by no means rare.  I pay 300 a month and my employer pays the rest.  When I say I am capped at 5k, I mean that after paying insurance I never have to pay above 5k a year for any medical procedures.  This isn't rare and it isn't bullshit, I just dont think you have much experience with our system and thus you arent all that knowledgable.  

And you keep saying I am fortunate.  I was replying to your absurd claim that 90% of Americans have it extremely rough.  I am replying precisely because I *am not* fortunate.  I dont make 250K a year as a physician, I dont have a graduate degree, I work a fairly average job, and I work a fairly average life.  Does it pain you this much that America does not represent the Somalia-esque situation you have concocted within your mind?  And one more thing, you keep going on and on about the less fortunate.  You do realize healthcare is absolutely free for for our poorest citizens and anyone over 65, right?  In fact, we spend far more on entitlements than we do on the military.  We have housing programs, food benefits, disability, etc...  What we don't have is a policy that says ""You exist and are able bodied but don't want to work?  Here is money, an apartment, and everything else you need to be comfortable""   it is an ideological difference, and although I want universal healthcare, I am not in favor of Europe's more generous social welfare programs.  America has too many ethnicities, immigrants, and clashing cultures for such a program to exist and function properly.  It would be abused to no end and bankrupt us, we already spend over a trillion dollars every year on the entitlements we do have.

He wondered why he hadn’t learned about those displaced bones and all the devastating health problems they cause during his undergraduate studies in anatomy, physiology, and biology. He noticed that his teachers never mentioned how hormones help regulate the human body. Despite glaring doubts about this profession, he stayed, simply because he had no other place to go.

64,"&gt; Politics for a start. Landscape is entirely different, not o ly in the kind of society people want to live in but also in terms of engagement.

England has around 55 million people, Scotland around 5, there are differences in politics in England from region to region, Yorkshire for example heavily votes labour, where as the south east counties vote conservative. Scotland tends to vote more left, but there are wayyyyy more people in England that also vote the same way as Scotland. And that being said Scotland is still not a united area politically.

&gt;  Got our own separate sports leagues which have a strong culture.

Sports leagues playing the exact same sports as the rest of the UK, reported on by British institutions, it's literally the exact same sports culture as the rest of the UK.

&gt; Media and programming can vary quite a bit

Nearly all the media in Scotland is the exact same media consumed in England, created by the same UK institutions.

&gt; as well as cultural output and consumption (Scottish traditional music is very popular).

It's about as popular as English folk music in England, the most popular by far is the mainstream music the rest of the UK listen to. You can see this by the most downloaded songs in England and Scotland.

161,"I'd say it depends.

&gt; Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine mostly concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine.[1][2] Some proponents, especially those in the field's early history, have claimed that such disorders affect general health via the nervous system,[2] through vertebral subluxation, claims which are contrary to scientific evidence.

-

&gt; Chiropractic is well established in the United States, Canada, and Australia.[18] It overlaps with other manual-therapy professions such as osteopathy and physical therapy.[19] Most who seek chiropractic care do so for low back pain.[20] Back and neck pain are considered the specialties of chiropractic, but many chiropractors treat ailments other than musculoskeletal issues.[4] Many chiropractors describe themselves as primary care providers,[4][21] but the chiropractic clinical training does not support the requirements to be considered primary care providers.[2] Chiropractic has two main groups: ""straights"", now the minority, emphasize vitalism, ""innate intelligence"", and consider vertebral subluxations to be the cause of all disease; ""mixers"", the majority, are more open to mainstream views and conventional medical techniques, such as exercise, massage, and ice therapy

&gt; D. D. Palmer founded chiropractic in the 1890s,[23] after saying he received it from ""the other world"",[24] and his son B. J. Palmer helped to expand it in the early 20th century.[23] Throughout its history, chiropractic has been controversial.[25][26] Its foundation is at odds with mainstream medicine, and has been sustained by pseudoscientific ideas such as subluxation and innate intelligence.[27] Despite the overwhelming evidence that vaccination is an effective public health intervention, among chiropractors there are significant disagreements over the subject,[28] which has led to negative impacts on both public vaccination and mainstream acceptance of chiropractic.[29] The American Medical Association called chiropractic an ""unscientific cult"" in 1966[30] and boycotted it until losing an antitrust case in 1987.

172,"&gt; Top country in science research which benefits not only US citizens, but the world

Only due to their size. If you look at it in per capita numbers then the USA isn't even close to #1 - Japan, UK, Israel are the top.

&gt;Tech giants... I'm willing to bet you are using one of their products wherever you are from and benefiting from it

Right you are. Although China is definitely moving up that list, and Korea is way up there too.

&gt;Medical research by far the most innovative and largest output, which allows EU countries to spend less on R&amp;D

Again, not true in a per capita basis at all. Not even in the top 3, and the nations that are ahead of them are far poorer (per capita of course)

&gt;Music &amp; entertainment, and it's not even close

I have no clue how to measure this one on a per capita basis, but you're probably right.

&gt;Absolute numbers must be looked at as well in comparison because citizens benefit from them. Per capita comparisons are also misleading. I can take Sweden and compare it to a contiguous area in the US with a population of 10 million and find better per capita indicators in that US region. The US is huge.

Well then it's hard to compare anything to the US simply due to sheer size. It's also extremely misleading as many of the fields you mentioned are extremely subsidized by the US federal government *and* certain states on top of that - like medical, tech, arts, and sciences ... so literally every point you mentioned has, or is, being massively subsidized by the federal government.

I think people were also exaggerating a smidge to get the point across. But the glory days of the USA are most definitely in the past.

Look at the USA from 1900 up until 1990. Practically #1 in every meaningful field, and at the very least among the absolute top in the ones that mattered.

Today? I mean it's a sad shell of what it used to be. It's all about short-term profits &amp; popularity.

Even as short as 30 years ago the top things kids wanted to be was astronauts, policemen, doctors, etc - today? It's a fucking YouTube celebrity or Instagram famous.

And yes, of course society changes, but my point is that the US as a society has put so much fucking focus on vanity, materialism, and money, that actually meaningful stuff has taken a back seat.

If you look at the numbers it's clear as day how badly we're fucking up. The #1 aspiration of kids 8-12 in the US &amp; UK is to be a YouTube celebrity. In China 56% said it was to be an astronaut.

American &amp; British kids have no fucking clue about tech either. Only 11% recognized that they are using tech that was designed for space - in China it was 44% of kids.

It's literally an internal brain drain, which is phenomenally sad and ridiculous. And of course this will partially happen, but when the society you live in puts so much emphasis on the wrong things: vanity, materialism, popularity - instead of things that *actually* matter &amp; benefit said society: Engineering, Sciences ...

185,"After a bit of digging, the first part seems to stem from a legal case called Brown v. Stone that the Mississippi Supreme Court heard in the late 70s. Apparently the state used to have religious exemptions to vaccination that were rather narrow; you had to be part of a religious organization that was recognized to instead rely on spiritual healing at large, so you couldn’t espouse it on your own while the larger body was OK with it and get by. A chiropractor tried to get a religious exemption for his kid but couldn’t because he was part of the Church of Christ denomination which doesn’t hold onto that belief at large, so he argued that the exemptions should be expanded because it would be state interference to force him to change to a state-exempted denomination on some list to uphold his personal religious beliefs against vaccination. This backfired for Brown because while the court agreed on the latter point and determined that the status quo was no good, it came down instead on canceling the religious exemption as it said it would be discriminating against children who didn’t have such religious beliefs by damaging their herd immunity.

Here’s a [summary](http://blog.petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2015/02/05/rdsilvermanmsvax/) or alternately the [actual case](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10659278449332404569&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr).

So unlike most of the other states, Mississippi only has medical exemptions for vaccines rather than allowing philosophical or religious ones. Medical exemptions being fairly rare, you have to vaccinate if you don’t want to homeschool your kid or something.

As to why Mississippi underperforms in other health indicators, for one it is I think is due primarily to two factors. One, it is one of the least urbanized states in the US, with just under half of its inhabitants living in a city compared to the larger US being at something like 80% on average. Rural life runs lifestyle risks for worse health, there’s greater separation from hospitals and health campaigns, not as much in the way of healthy restaurants and the like and it’s harder to go to the gym when you have a longer way to travel there, so on and so forth. Also Mississippi is a poorer state in part because unlike similarly or moreso rural states (Vermont, Maine, West Virginia) it has a large African-American population descending from people who were enslaved there. Obviously they had no wealth to speak of upon their nominal freedom into a heavily segregated society that suppressed and terrorized them with great brutality into living memory, which is several steps below the conditions present for the bulk of the population in those other rural states I mentioned.",Mississippi,/r/europe/comments/d05yps/why_does_france_have_the_lowest_levels_of_trust/ez87hye/,sparkling_uranium,1567736075

To a degree yes, but the missions / roles (and with it the equipment, staff, and doctrine) are pretty different. 

That is a big part of the reason why the German forces are in such a shambles at the moment. A while into Afghanistan they pitched into an interventionist mission set (so much so that they abandoned homeland defense from their mission set). They also shrunk down drastically because they didn't need piles of heavy shit and conscripts for intervention. So they slimmed down their actual operational stuff, and used a lot of the rest as spare parts repository - leading to the notorious readiness levels.  
Then Ukraine happened and now they do their second 180 degree turn. I can only imagine what the mood of a career soldier must be like going through that crap.

In the longer view though I think it will come quite natural to separate these two according to mission and ambition. Yes, there will be some overlap in kit, but anything halfway expeditionary is governed by logistics (and easy of maintenance), and that is going to be a pretty clear dividing line, which then also extends to doctrine, ROE, training, etc. etc.",,/r/europe/comments/d00vir/what_do_you_guys_think/ez7kpz3/,devilshitsonbiggestp,1567724961

As a total herbicide, it destroys all plants without distinction, thereby destroying the food and livelihoods of many insect and bird species such as butterflies and skylarks. This has been scientifically proven several times. 

https://www.bmu.de/pressemitteilung/schulze-legt-plan-fuer-glyphosat-ausstieg-vor/

&gt;The herbicide glyphosate disrupts bee gut microbiota, increasing the bees' susceptibility to pathogens, a study suggests. Glyphosate is used worldwide and targets an enzyme found only in plants and microorganisms. However, animals that rely on gut microbiota for health, such as pollinator honey bees, may be susceptible to adverse health effects arising from glyphosate exposure.

Cyber defense might be even more important than that.

&gt;The National Education Association has released its annual analysis of teacher salaries. The national average public school teacher salary for 2017-18 was $60,477—a 1.6 percent increase from the previous year. NEA estimates that the national average salary for the 2018-19 school year is $61,730—a 2.1 increase from the prior school year.

The range is huge, though. 

Also interesting

&gt;The U.S. average per-student expenditure in 2017‒18 based on fall enrollment was $12,602. The following
states had the highest per-student expenditures: New York ($23,894), District of Columbia ($21,001), and
New Jersey ($20,171). Idaho ($6,809), Utah ($7,187), and Arizona ($8,123) had the lowest per-student

&gt; The functioning of this phone number, managed by the National Federation for Women's Solidarity and supported by the Ministry of Women's Rights, is based on a partnership with the main national associations working for gender equality, women's rights and combating gender-based and sexual violence against women, namely: the Association européenne contre les violences faites aux femmes au travail, the Association Femmes solidaires, the Association Voix de Femmes, the Centre national d'information des droits et des familles, the Collectif féministe contre le viol, the Fédération Nationale du Groupe pour l'Abolition des Mutilations Sexuelles Féminines, des Mariages Forcés et autres pratiques traditionnelles néfastes à la santé des femmes et des enfants and the Mouvement français pour le planification familial. 3919 provides a first reception for all women victims of gender-based violence. When necessary, it refers to national or local partner associations, which are best able to provide the most appropriate response.

And

&gt; 3919 is an anonymous and free listening number, and a team of professional listeners ensures a caring listening by creating a climate of trust that allows the person (female victim, third parties) to talk about the situation and clarify their analysis of it. The objective of this listening is to enable the person to act, through appropriate information on the steps to be taken and the role of social workers. The aim is, as far as possible, to direct the victim to a specialised association that can assist her in her efforts.

No, not really. Skepticism requires no knowledge of the subject. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skepticism

&gt; Being ""skeptical"" of vaccines or climate change or evolution is just ignorance at best and willfully believing outright bullshit no matter what at worst.

I have to disagree with you here. We couldn't be confident that vaccines work, climate change is happening, or evolution happens without skepticism. A skeptical attitude requires that EVERY claim have evidence to back it up before it is accepted as true. Now that we're fairly confident about those things, we can't just accept any claim about them without evidence. If someone comes and tells me tomorrow that sea levels have risen five feet in the last decade, I'm not going to automatically believe it. I'm going to be skeptical.

They consider how will it affect them in an idealized world where they became billionaires, and if you tell them ""Sorry, you are not going to become a billionaire"" they you are being rude and disrespectful.

The second, they have a wrong way of evaluating money. They think ""Oh, that is a tax that can cause the government to take millions from me"", and they go into outrage, without realizing that for that to happen, you need to have so much money it no longer causes the same reaction.

506,"&gt;Damn, aren't some western Europeans ungrateful. Only reason you didn't become another USSR satellite and could thrive during cold war is USA protection. Luxury that eastern countries didn't have.

Ungrateful? Not at all. I understand that USA helped Europe, and so did many other nations around the world. And yes, USA certainly had a protective role towards Europe during the cold war, which is awesome. But, the cold war has ended 30 years ago. Russia is not USSR neither in name, strength or system. The USA is not the same USA as back then. Most historians would argue that the end of the cold war marks another chapter; so let's stick to that. Trump is currently the laughing stock of the world and whole Obama was competent we also had Bush who started wars in the middle east - dragging their allies into an unjustified war. 

&gt;What did western European great powers ever did for Eastern Europe when they had the chance? One of them was busy invading it while two other looked the other way and hoped feeding them east is enough to satisfy their appetite and save their own asses.

Yes, certainly there are bad parts of history in each country. Lets not forget that the eastern European countries happily danced to tune of the German flute and some of them happily engaged in the expansionist policy. For instance the Munich treaty saw Poland acquire territory in the eastern and northern part of Czechoslovakia and they actively supported and armed poles so that they could take Vilnius. We also have traumatized Hungary which happily ate all the lands returned to them by the Germans. It's only really the Czech and Slovak people who didn't do engage in these behaviours. That being said many of the Slovaks initially saw Germany has liberators. And the historical joke of the Czechs are ""when do you know the war is over? - the Czechs rebel"". 

Now that I've provided some nuance to your very good vs evil perspective, I would like to argue that looking back some 80 years can be fine for a little background but it hardly makes sense to argue any position from that point of view. Today we have western Europe embracing eastern Europe. I stayed 6 weeks in Poland recently - I saw signs ""made with EU funding"" on a lot of things from roads to bussigns. The EU did not have to let eastern Europe in, but these apparently ungrateful western powers did - and that is despite the fact that eastern Europe were very poor, faced structural problems not to mention a deficit in democratic values - which we sadly still see today in Hungary and other eastern countries to this day.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/d00vir/what_do_you_guys_think/ez5qams/,Secuter,1567703039

Which also means there's no time for Boris to negotiate a new deal anyway, especially since each side has conflicting red lines. And even if there were a new deal, Parliament would just reject it again anyway. 

And of course Boris is being political, but at least he has the decency to call an election and stop Parliament from endlessly delaying Brexit. Everyone else in Parliament is being just as political, except the Speaker has just broken the law in favour of remain. 

&gt; and then a safe 5 years for the electorate to forget the short term consequences of no deal.

We're talking about insect die off, yet you linked to a study that talks about the effect of glyphosate on the gut biome of rats.
I cant find any studies on the effect of glyphosate in wild insects, especially pollinators, simply because they are hardly researched at all as it is. Nobody knows! And yet you claim all is fine, while all i said is **CAN** harm. There are plenty of studies that show that glyphosate has **SOME** effect on all kinds of organisms. 


Even your linked study says so!

&gt;  A strong correlation was observed between intestinal concentrations of glyphosate and intestinal pH, which may partly be explained by an observed reduction in acetic acid produced by the gut bacteria.

So, glyphosate does *something* to the gut microbiome. Is the pH of the gut irrelevant? Would this have affected the rats somehow if they were allowed to live longer than 2 weeks? Are there comparable effects in other animals? 




&gt; [..]this is likely to be explained by sufficient bioavailability of aromatic amino acids in the gut environment, alleviating the effect of glyphosate blocking the Shikimate pathway. However, in cases of human malnutrition or in subjects consuming special (e.g. low protein) diets that may cause lower levels of available amino acids in the gut, a detrimental effect of glyphosate cannot be excluded.



Most insects consume totally different diets from rats. Wild bees (imagos) almost exclusively feed off nectar which is extremely lacking in amino acids and protein. [Some oligolectic bees are specialized to amino acid poor pollen.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1051/apido/2009083) Could it be that they are dependent on gut microbiomens for amino acid synthesis?


You really want to claim with confidence there is no harm because of a 2 week study on rats?


Edit: By the way, i think banning it is a stupid knee jerk reaction. The effects of glyphosate should be further investigated, but i'm afraid it'll just be replaced with something worse.

628,"The arrangement could undoubtedly be improved, however I can't see how one can overcome the fact that in order to prevent a hard border in Ireland the options are either a country-wide customs union or a sea border for the purposes of tariffs and regulations between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. For this reason the backbone of the ""interim measure"" would probably become permanent.

Moreover, there's no reason why the freedom of movement couldn't be ended as soon as Brexit takes place since Britain intends to leave the single market precisely to do away with it.

As I see it, the sea border would've been the least worst option. May's deal, by contrast, would have limited the scope of the country-wide customs union to goods.

Though the following quote should be read with a grain of salt, I think it is helpful to note May's view on Labour's stance regarding the withdrawal arrangement that she expressed in her capacity as PM:

&gt;Labour are both sceptical of our ability to negotiate [Britain's own trade and development policy] and don’t believe an independent trade policy is in the national interest.

748,"So dynamically, the 737 MAX is not stable. Meaning that ""by default"", the plane would lift its nose further up while simply operating. This is a known design flaw due to Boeing wishing to re-design an old plane instead of creating a new one from scratch - which would cost way more, and take much more time (and they were already late vs. Airbus).

To counter that effect, they created the MCAS system which, when reading that the angle of attack is too high, would trim the plane down and make the nose go down. This is done automatically, with no need for pilot input, nor acknowledgement. There was also no mandatory redundancy for this critical software. The system was relying on only one sensor (additional sensors were optional and not free) - should that sensor fails or has a wrong reading, there was no other sensor to detect it, so the pilot would not even know there is something wrong. With more sensors (which, again, is possible but Boeing would charge you for that), the pilots would be able to get a ""sensor disagreement"" warning, meaning that they 2 sensors are getting 2 different info/1 sensor is faulty.

And then, there are the other issues I mentioned above (pilots inputs not having priority, system restarting, ...).

&gt; there is an integer overflow error, the plane thinks its stalling, and tilts the nose down using the trim

I've never heard of this, so... maybe? I know that, after the crash, Boeing tried to correct its software and the FAA found out that the micro-processor of the plane could in some case overflow and wouldn't be able to handle the modified version of the software. Not the base software.

&gt; The plane should never have auto trimmed in the first place to protect against stalls.

The plane does it every time because it's dynamically unstable. It has to. The issue is when it is wrongly believing it's going into a stall.",,/r/europe/comments/czz3p3/europe_will_not_accept_us_verdict_on_737_max/ez4mj2y/,Aeliandil,1567689103

784,"&gt; Taxing transaction would heavily reduce liquidity for no real gian. It is much smarter to tax the profits. 

The main point of the Tobin Tax (financial transactions tax) is not to actually collect money, but to desincentivize financial speculation: a 0.1% tax on every transaction means nothing to the citizens, but works against the banks pulling out the kind of bullshit they did prior to the '08 Crash.

&gt; Obviously people are more free the less coerced they are? 

Not always. You need to limit some freedoms in order to preserve others. For example, do you think a society where people are free to have slaves is a freer society than one which is not? 

You might say it is not a valid example because those people are harming others' freedom by keeping them as slaves, but to that I would reply that you are also harming others' freedom when you deny them effective access to the tools they need to lead a free and meaningful life (healthcare, education, culture, etc.) or when the way you treat them affects their freedom (labor rights, LGBT+ discrimination, etc.). 

Therefore, I have to forbid you from doing certain things, and I have to give services to others (paid in part with your money), to ensure that everyone is truly free. Because being technically free to go to college is not worth a dime when it costs €30,000 a year (which most people just can't afford) and you are not even allowed entry for being a woman/gay/black/whatever. 

That's why *technically* less coercive societies are not necessarily *really* freer. The social contract (as established by Rousseau) demands that, in order to live together in society, we all shed a little freedom so that we gain much more (we shed the freedom to kill at whim to live free from murder, etc.).","Spain, European Federation",/r/europe/comments/czx2b1/number_of_superrich_in_spain_grows_74_since/ez4ngd3/,NombreGracioso,1567689455

To date this model covers only part of the energy system, namely the electricity and heat sectors, which correspond to about 62% of Germany's current energy demand. The main findings of our work indicate that **it is possible to meet the total electricity and heat demand (space heating, hot water) of the entire building sector with 100% renewable energy** within the given technical limits. This is based on the assumption that the heat demand of the building sector is significantly reduced by at least 60% or more compared to today's demand. Another major result of our analysis shows that – once the transformation of the energy system has been completed – **supplying electricity and heat only from renewables is no more expensive than the existing energy supply.**",Germany,/r/europe/comments/czwuzw/because_a_world_without_insects_is_not_worth/ez470cb/,Svorky,1567682095

&gt;all the other stuff about social stance

I'm aware and I don't give a toss about them. They're meaningless words. As u/cissoniuss rightly points out, we'd be alienating half  the member states if we stood by article 2 to the letter. European solidarity and the integrity of the Union is more important than you having a problem with their social stances. It is not feasible to kick out Poland, nor is it desirable. The onus isn't on them to change, the onus is on you to accept their stance for the time being. If you take a liberal position on social affairs, then you need only bide your time. 

&gt;Not much unity when we don't have shared values, imho.

There is more that unites us than divides us. Trade, politics, Europeanness, Future, history, so on, so on. We are in a political and economic confederation together: of course there is a sense of unity. 

&gt;If we stop caring about our EU values, the Treaty is worthless, which, in my very humble opinion, would make the whole of the EU worhtless.

If the EU to you just comes down to ""lets force poland to accept lgbt"" then I don't know what else to say. The EU is about European unity, about a common front against a world that has no gripes with tearing us apart, and is about bringing a once war torn continent together. If we have to turn a blind eye to what some may perceive as poor social stances for a while, then so be it.  

&gt;We don't need an EU to cooperate. We can do with another kind of trade union.

958,"&gt;gay marriage

Gay marriage isn't necessarily about equality, as long as you offer realistic alternatives. Equality is more than just a piece of paper.

But no doubt, there's room for improvement in a lot of countries, including [my own](https://rainbow-europe.org/).

But there's a huge difference between not allowing gay marriage and the ruling party [branding them a threat to the country](https://www.france24.com/en/20190425-kaczynski-calls-lgbt-rights-threat-poland).

Also, there's a huge difference between *moving away* from those values and *moving towards* them.

But as I said, Poland isn't the only one sliding into authoritarian behavior, just one of the more [evident](https://infographics.economist.com/2019/DemocracyIndex/) ones.

&gt;So we need to start by kicking out

No, because, as is mentioned above, the EU cannot do that.

I'm saying, why do we have a Treaty with values if Member States don't give a crap about it and the EU can't enforce it?

It is out of sync with your thread's title, which explicitly states it is about net wages, yet the chart is sorted by *gross* wages not net wages. Just because both information is there doesn't mean the title is accurate, given that the chart is sorting for gross.

1116,"&gt; living standards in Slovenia is about 20% lower than in countries like Italy, Spain, Finland, Denmark, Sweden

We're talking about turkey here. The notion that Turkish net PPP wages are higher than Slovenia's is absurd. I looked at OECD's data and their figure for annual gross Turkish wages is 47K liras (in nominal terms) which they then convert to PPP.

Just so we are clear, that is almost 3900 liras in average wage on a monthly basis in nominal terms. I *highly* doubt that is the average gross monthly wage in Turkey. Turkstat came out with household median income a few weeks ago and stated it was 2800 liras per month. And that is *household* which includes multiple earners in some cases.

&gt; Disposable income is closest to the concept of income as generally understood in economics. Household disposable income measures the income of households (wages and salaries, self-employed income, income from unincorporated enterprises, social benefits, etc.), after taking into account net interest and dividends received and the payment of taxes and social contributions. Net signifies that depreciation costs have been subtracted from the income presented. ""Real” means that the indicator has been adjusted to remove the effects of price changes. Household gross adjusted disposable income is the income adjusted for transfers in kind received by households, such health or education provided for free or at reduced prices by government and NPISHs. This indicator is presented both in terms of annual growth rates (for real net disposable income) and in terms of USD per capita at current prices and PPPs (gross adjusted disposable income). All OECD countries compile their data according to the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA 2008).

1205,"&gt;So my point again is if the UK (and other European countries, albeit not Germany..) are able to both meet NATO spending targets and meet their UN obligations, but the US refuses to meet its UN obligations (binding at that, as per the UN charter) how is the US not at least as hypocritical as the likes of Germany. And why wouldn't the UK, or Poland be able to call out the US for that kind of approach. The same goes for the US's approach to meeting its climate change obligations, and the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.

That is invalid. The US has no obligation to to what the UN wants. Just like any other nation. These binding rules have been broken and you refuse to acknowledge that because it hurts your nationalistic ego. And the UK haven't met the UN commitment in many instances.

[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/sep/16/britain-un-human-rights-brexit](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/sep/16/britain-un-human-rights-brexit)

And before you go on about the US isn't either. I'm not denying it. I never denied that we haven't done so either. But you just like every other European hate to admit that you are in the same pot as us.

&gt;How is it bullshit? The UK has met its NATO commitments since NATO came into being, there were tens of thousands of UK troops in Germany for all of the cold war, UK defence expenditure was massive relative to its size, it has been involved in every NATO operation. It continues to meet its spending obligations and is going through a major modernisation programme (you'll note the aircraft carriers and submarines, and frigates, and new aircraft and new vehicles...). It also meets its UN commitments, engaging in operations and sitting on the UNSC. And it does so while meeting international climate targets and upholding its other international commitments.

I wasn't even talking about NATO I was talking about commitment in UN. Which I already provide sources. And we haven't even signed any Climate Change pacts with anyone for the past three years. Don't know why you bring that up. And besides, every Climate change pack isn't even being met. For instance the Paris agreement isn't being upheld by a single country.

&gt;No, I'm contrasting the UK with the US in this context.

Ok so British ego. Considering I never denied anything regarding the US have I?

&gt;My point about the UN is that the US should either pay what it said it would, or work through some reform. It can only do what it is empowered, by its members, to do after all.

Yes, like the UK.

If all you are doing is sprouting is your british Ego turn around. I'm looking for valid arguments. And all you have done was show me how ridiculous you are.

1222,"I certainly don't agree with claims as to genocide -- that's just stupid -- but it's true that Britons in India were living comfortably at a time when considerable numbers of Indians were starving.  That's not to say that Churchill had any kind of personal involvement to work to ensure that this was the case, but one can understand why Indians would have hard feelings over it.  If you look at, say, the UK herself during the Second World War, which was also facing major shipping issues, rationing was put in place early and pain spread across the population, affecting all Britons, to ensure that nobody starved.

I'm presently reading *The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 1781-1997*.  To extract a bit of relevant text:

&gt;For at least eighty years Britain had served India, [Churchill] said, bringing peace, trade and progress. “Our stewardship and our mission may come to an end but to India it may well be the age of the Antonines.” This was the delectable epoch, classically described by Gibbon, when the Emperors convinced mankind that Roman power “was actuated only by the love of order and justice.” However, Churchill did not deliver his speech. Perhaps he doubted whether the historical allusion was sound or feared that it would conjure up the spectre of imperial decline and fall. Certainly he was conscious of the danger of “stirring up controversy” in the Commons by raising “big issues” about the subcontinent. For by the end of 1942 there was a big issue on the horizon, which nationalists could plausibly present as the hideous “fulfilment of British rule in India.” This was the “man-made famine” that ravaged Bengal for over a year. It was much worse than anything experienced since the 1770s, wrote one ICS officer, Philip Mason, who said that the heart-rending scenes he witnessed in the towns were “a shame and a reproach to men of English blood.”
&gt;
&gt; Acts of God caused the dearth of food in India but mammon created the Bengal famine. Failed monsoons and poor harvests had raised the price of grain. Rice imports from Burma had dried up, replaced by a flood of refugees. Although many Indians prospered during the war, inflation had sapped the slim resources of the poor—that third of the population always on the brink of starvation. However, the provincial administration was hopelessly unprepared for the catastrophe. The British Governor was myopic and moribund; the Bengal ministry was corrupt and inept. Instead of procuring food themselves, the authorities advised people to keep two months’ stock, which encouraged hoarding, increased prices and produced a “psychosis of shortage.”  The authorities were also slow to introduce rationing, to prevent profiteering and to supply needy districts with such food as they did obtain, which was stored under tarpaulins in Calcutta’s Botanical Gardens. Indeed, they impeded the distribution of provisions. In a panic measure they destroyed some fifty thousand coastal craft in the Ganges delta to deny their use to the Japanese and their allies, the 25,000-strong Indian National Army (INA), recruited from sepoys captured at Singapore and commanded by Subhas Chandra Bose. He seemed to be the real menace. Uniformed and bespectacled, the aspirant Führer of India had adopted the tiger emblem of Tipu Sultan and the watchword of the 1857 mutineers, “Delhi chalo!”—“Onward to Delhi!”
&gt;
&gt;Meanwhile, a legion of the destitute marched on palsied limbs to Calcutta. In that city and in provincial towns some aid was available but it could never meet the needs of the famished multitude. So emaciated men in rags scavenged for scraps through filth-strewn bustees and collapsed in the doorways of blacked-out shops and offices. Clutching infants of skin and bone, skeletal women cried for alms on the pavements of Chowringhee and the platforms of Howrah. Fighting for offal in the dustbins of clubs and hotels, where affluent Indians as well as Europeans continued to eat substantial meals, stray waifs reverted to the wild and “got into the habit of feeding like dogs.” Every morning corpses, decomposing in the steamy heat and often gnawed by rats or jackals, littered the streets. The Calcutta Statesman printed gruesome pictures of the shambles. But censors changed the word “famine” to “grave food shortage” and an official spokesman for the Viceroy accused the press of dramatising the situation. The Delhi government, which was ultimately responsible for the welfare of the subject people, gagged its critics and dragged its feet. Linlithgow professed concern. But unlike his successor, Field-Marshal Lord Wavell, who galvanised the relief work, he did not visit Bengal. One ex-member of his Council said that Linlithgow had shown a “callous disregard of duty.”

-

&gt; Meanwhile, conditions in Bengal had deteriorated, reaching a ghastly nadir during the autumn of 1943. Altogether malnutrition and diseases stemming from it killed some three million people. But Churchill’s chief scientific adviser, Lord Cherwell, who thought that Africans and Indians were subhuman, dismissed the famine as a statistical invention—just as he likened Gandhi’s “change of diet” to taking the cure.  Despite pleas from Amery, the Prime Minister refused to divert scarce shipping to Calcutta and little was done to bring relief when it was most needed, though American aid came later. Churchill regarded the dispatch of food to India as an appeasement of Congress and he believed that “the starvation of anyway underfed Bengalis is less serious [than that of] sturdy Greeks.”  He added that despite the famine Indians would go on breeding “like rabbits.”  The Prime Minister continued to harp on this theme at the very time when the new Governor of Bengal, an able Australian administrator called Richard Casey, was sending Wavell a shocked indictment of accumulated British failures in his province:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Bengal has, practically speaking, no irrigation or drainage, a medieval system of agriculture, no roads, no education, no cottage industries, completely inadequate hospitals, no effective public health services; consequently there is no real attempt to deal with malaria, which is the province’s principal scourge and killer, and no adequate machinery to cope with distress. There are not even plans to make good these deficiencies.
&gt;
&gt;The Prime Minister’s view seemed to be that it served them right. In February 1945, recorded his private secretary Jock Colville, Churchill described Hindus as a “foul race ‘protected by their mere pullulation from the doom that is their due’ and he wished [Air Marshal] Bert Harris could send some of his surplus bombers to destroy them.”  Amery was once bold enough to tell the Prime Minister that he had a “Hitler-like attitude” to India, for which, according to Wavell, he “got a first-class rocket.”

Churchill certainly did not aim to kill off Indians.  And it was certainly factors outside of the UK's control that reduced food coming into India.

And it is only fair to consider his opinions in the context of the time.  The typical European view of the Indian when Churchill was born is not the typical European view today.  Else we could simply go through history and dredge up countless examples of people who held views typical of their time and call them objectionable.

But it is also true that there were things that could probably have been done that were not done, and that it is probably fair to say that Churchill considered Indians to be comparatively-expendable, that he did not consider the occurrence of famine or mass death in India to be nearly the issue that he would have considered the same in the UK.

That is, he might have done sketchy things both for Russian intelligence and for God-knows-who.  I mean, the basic idea here is that the man kills people for hire, yes?  Doesn't seem unreasonable for that not to be an exclusive relationship with the Russian government.

* I'm not entirely sure that Russia has enough of a handle on things to keep identities from being sold.  Russia's got issues with criminality in her own intelligence agencies already.  If they can obtain identities for people, how certain can one be that someone in there isn't obtaining them for whoever?

* I'm not entirely sure that Russia has enough of a handle on things to be sure that even people working with her intelligence agencies, much less people contracting with them, aren't off running their own projects using state resources.

&gt; However, Putin’s Russia is also very much an ‘adhocracy’. Institutions and formal positions, whether one is a civil servant or not, matter very little. What matters is how useful one is to the state. As a result, any individual or structure may be called-upon as and when the need arises. The blurring of social and functional boundaries in this way has also, inevitably, blurred the legal ones. Just as the Soviet state frequently used criminals and agents as instruments, whether controlling political prisoners in the Gulags or compromising foreigners, so Putin has continued the tradition and also put them to use. A quintessential example is Viktor Bout, a man whose career spanned the worlds of crime, business, and intelligence work − and often all three at the same time. An intelligence officer, probably from the GRU (military intelligence),[13] he set up an air freight business specialising in shipping to dangerous destinations. Alongside delivering aid, he was also implicated in sanctions busting and arms dealing, periodically as an apparent agent of the Russian state. It is unclear whether his offer to sell 700 Russian Igla surface-to-air missiles to Colombian FARC narco-rebels was on Moscow’s behalf (although the volume of the missiles he could acquire suggests so), but his example illustrates the smooth and often imperceptible transition between official and non-official roles.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cxfztb/suspected_assassin_in_the_berlin_killing_used/ez2dqxw/,vokegaf,1567654610

Generally countries don't break 'every binding rule in the book' though do they? Generally there are few binding rules, and on top of that the countries that determine whether there has been a breach and what consequences there might be tend to be fairly limited in their actions. But then that's what the UN is supposed to be isn't it? A vehicle for avoiding conflict?

&gt;I wasn't referring the UK. Especially sense the UK is one of the few members actually paying the 2%. I'm more referring to Germany. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/world/europe/germany-nato-spending-target.html

&gt;I wasn't referring the UK. Especially sense the UK is one of the few members actually paying the 2%. I'm more referring to Germany. 

Then say what you mean, otherwise you just look silly.

&gt;I wasn't denying about us not spending our share in the UN. I was proving a point how much hypocrates you guys are. 

You'll have to explain who 'you' is here. I'm a Brit, the UK seems to be meeting its NATO and UN commitments, is there a reason the US can't? The UK is also meeting its climate change obligations, the US dumped that, the UK is also meeting the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the US binned that too... I don't think in that context that you have a lot of grounds to call me hypocritical. Or are you sort of vaguely lumping a continent together because that's somehow easier?

&gt;Americans by nature are the number one criticizers of the US. While Europeans love to feed their ego. But once facts come their way it hurts them like hell. And the downvotes prove that.

Really? That doesn't seem to be the case here though does it...

&gt;And besides we have begun to have more negative feelings towards the UN.

Super, so take action on it, push for reform, leave... Of course the UN has served the US very well over the years, essentially this is domestic politics playing silly international games because it brushes against the US's ability to act unilaterally.

&gt;As I mentioned before, every country has broken almost every ""binding"" in the books. Let alone listen to what the UN has to say at all. But you guys won't admit that.

And I pointed out that most of the rules countries break aren't binding. The interesting thing with sovereign states is that they don't like to bind themselves when they can avoid it, so you end up with agreements to make use of specific dispute resolution mechanisms, rather than outright bans (mostly).",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/czpyps/un_budget_who_has_paid_their_dues/ez19l81/,-ah,1567646179

1380,"&gt; While remaining in the customs union, following EU regulations with no say over them and doing so until the EU agrees we can stop doing so. Not exactly what you expect when you vote for a return of powers to the UK.

Well, no, that's the backstop as originally agreed but then extended to cover the whole UK at the insistence of the DUP. And that's only necessary if the UK wants to remain integrated with the single market - market access requires playing by market rules.

The UK can't have member state equivalent access to the single market without abiding by the rules of the single market. It's its own decision to stop having input to those rules. If it doesn't want the rules, it can't have the access - that's eating your cake and still having it stuff right there.

&gt;There is no treaty that says a departing member must continue making payments, there is no legal requirement for the UK to give the EU a penny. Same as there is no requirement for the EU to give the UK anything

A specific clause in the EU Treaty isn't required, it's covered by the global body of accepted law covering treaties - an internationally accepted set of T &amp; Cs, if you like, and similar to the laws governing contracts. Any obligations entered into by way of a treaty stand unless the party is repudiating the treaty. The UK isn't repudiating the EU treaties it signed, it's exiting via an exit mechanism provided for in the treaties.

&gt;I haven't found the clause that dictates a customs union, although I accept the spirit of the agreement certainly implies the border should stay as open as possible.

More or less so. As you say, ""the GFA didn't anticipate either country leaving the customs union"". 

&gt;I'd argue that as the GFA didn't anticipate either country leaving the customs union, a referendum on Northern Ireland's position is the only fair way to decide

Do you mean a specific referendum on remaining in the customs union? Because a referendum on whether to join Ireland or remain in the UK doesn't really help the situation at all.

&gt;Which ones? And this wouldn't be an exception for a member, it would be an agreement with a departed member, surely that's a different thing

Depends on how you view the exception, but the obvious examples are the overseas territories of France, Netherlands, and Denmark. And since the exception is there in recognition of the troubled history of the region, well, there are plenty of regions with troubled histories in EU countries.

&gt;Have to disagree here, the EU hasn't exactly been helpful, but nor has the UK, I blame both sides for this failure

The only way the EU hasn't been helpful is their failure to give up their red lines to make the UK's position of eating their cake and having it possible. In every other respect - timetabling, access, political pressure - they've been entirely obliging.

I'm not a fan of boris, but pushing people out who don't agree with his strategy at least means he has a party with a clear opinion on this one issue.

Meanwhile, the lib-dems, who were slowly coming to a clear position on a number of other things after having been a merger of two parties for years, are now slowly bluring their identity on everything but this one issue by accepting anti-brexit refugees from other parties, many of whom have been furiously attacking each other for years on their records.

But this shouldn't be surprising, only the lib-dems really were passionate europeans originally, and apart from a small faction of the conservative party that really hated it, everyone else had what I think is the usual attitude of most europeans, it's alright, good sometimes, bad others, on balance probably more good than bad.

The ukip push around 2010, and the referendum, forced an issue that was basically a newspaper hobbyhorse no-one paid much attention to (and so never bothered to debunk) into a central political question, and I think an awful lot of politicans have been going ""can we get back to tax cuts/stopping austerity/stopping climate change please?""",,/r/europe/comments/czpjov/boris_johnson_has_lost_control_and_more_talks_are/ez0mj0s/,eliminating_coasts,1567638928

1563,"There is no legal condition for 'good faith', it was only mentioned in an **advisory opinion, not the actual ruling:**

&gt;There are various key points on which the CJEU judgment differs from the AG opinion. First, **there is no mention of conditionality of unilateral revocation in the CJEU judgment; the concept of ‘good faith’ is not mentioned**, and instead the sovereign power of the UK to both notify withdrawal and revoke notification of withdrawal is stressed. Indeed, the CJEU talks of an ‘unequivocal and unconditional’ decision made by the Member State. This removes a significant amount of uncertainty present in the AG Opinion’s regarding what a ‘bad faith’ revocation, or a ‘bad faith’ re-notification’, would look like, and who would assess if such a revocation was in ‘good’ or ‘bad’ faith. But the concept of an ‘unequivocal’ revocation accomplishes the same purpose: the goal of revocation must be to actually stay in the EU, not to alter the shape of negotiations.

Regarding being dissolved into a superstate, except if there's some huge unexpected events, I don't think the EU will merge into a superstate soon. The huge majority still identify as citizens of their own country and not citizens of the EU (at least where I live)

Let's say the EU will merge into a superstate in 5 years. In that case, even as a total pro-EU, I think the bare minimum would be a referendum requiring a majority, and merging all EU countries into one is such an important decision that I'm sure there will be one, except if it's 100% clear the majority is in favor of it. It would be stupid to force a country into a larger one if a majority of the population want to break from it before even being in it.

It’s useful for per capita GDP when you are using that as a stand-in for salaries. (IOW, a low salary may not be as low as it appears because it’s in a country where things cost less).

1624,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_fathers_of_the_European_Union

&gt; The founding fathers of the European Union are 11 men officially recognised as major contributors to European unity and the development of what is now the European Union. Of these, all but one (Winston Churchill from the United Kingdom) were from the Inner Six of the European Union. 

|Name|Country|Description|
|-|-|-|
|Winston Churchill|United Kingdom|British Prime Minister during World War II, Churchill called for a ""United States of Europe"", organised democratically, to prevent future wars in Europe. He was a driving force behind the creation of the Council of Europe, a forerunner of the European Union.|

He was a figure in the creation of the European Union, and he supported its creation, but he also did not -- at least at the time -- see the UK as a part of that United States of Europe.

The Zurich speech is a good way to illustrate that Churchill was not opposed to the creation of a tightly-knit, federal European Union.

On the other hand, he was not arguing for the UK to be in the EU.

However, the UK's *subsequent* decision-making as to EU membership has to be taken in context of the fact that the British Empire, what Churchill saw the UK as being principally-associated with, did not really wind up maintaining a strongly-politically-cohesive form.  That is, Churchill's first choice didn't really exist in the form that he'd hoped it to.

So using his Zurich speech as an argument that Churchill would not have wanted the *present-day* United Kingdom to be in the EU is, I think, something of a stretch.

I quoted [a 1948 speech above](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/czjybo/winston_churchills_grandson_to_be_expelled_from/eyznpus/) from after India left where he more-or-less highlights that it is a British interest to be involved in *all* of the British Empire/US/EU circles of power.  Listening to Blair speaking a bit back -- where he talked about how it was a British interest to be in the US and EU circles of power, which was pretty much the same as Churchill in '48, other than not mentioning the British Empire -- it seems to me that that's not changed much.  Basically, he'd rather the UK not be cut out of decision-making.

The real issue comes up if the EU federalizes, in which case it's hard for me to see how the UK was going to not have to make a sort of ""in or out"" call at some level, unless the UK manages some sort of really unusual status (and frankly, the UK didn't seem too interested in accelerating federalization).  I think that it's safe to say that the British leadership was pretty happy with the status quo prior to Brexit, where the EU was a confederation, the UK was in, and the UK also spent a lot of time collaborating with the US and did some occasional diplomatic, military, and intelligence projects with the Commonwealth.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/czjybo/winston_churchills_grandson_to_be_expelled_from/eyzsnr8/,vokegaf,1567624107

1630,"&gt; As it turned out, the answer we should have all seen coming was ""Mansanto is killing them with pesticides.""

No, you're talking about colony collapse disorder (CCD), and the prevailing theories are that there are a number of colony stressors that, when combined, can lead to collapse. It's probable that insecticide use is part of the answer, but it's every bit as likely that things like modern agricultural practices and constant transportation of hives stresses the bees out. Your demand for cheap fruit is probably just as much a contributor to CCD as is any pesticide use.

Most people don't even understand what CCD is. It's not a bunch of dead bees. If you go out to a hive and find a bunch of dead bees, that's not CCD, that's a colony wiped out by illness or direct and inappropriate pesticide exposure. CCD is when you go out to a hive and the bees are just gone, like they've fucked off a low wage job without giving notice because they're fed up with your shit.

Pesticide kills bees, but killing bees is not the problem. CCD is the problem, but even CCD has been much less severe than originally thought, and beekeepers are good at adapting.",,/r/europe/comments/czi0xr/timeline_of_uks_governments_majority/eyzssn2/,EZ-PEAS,1567624175

&gt; 1. what would this 'deal' be? Would it be speculative or written by the EU + our parliament ready to be signed if people agree to it?

It would have an already agreed upon deal as an option, alongide revoking article 50 and leaving without the deal. As far as I am aware many of the MPs who called for a referendum rejected the deal May agreed UNLESS it were put in front of the people so they could be given the final say.

&gt; 2. what voter turnout would make this vote valid.? 72% of the voters turned out for the second referendum to vote Leave as a majority 64% turned out for the 1975 EEC to vote Remain as a majority

Not voting is a right of the british people, so I doubt there can be any lower limits on turn out.

&gt; 4. what if we voted remain as a whole- will the EU make us have new terms?

No, we can revoke Article 50 at any time and maintain our existing position in the EU.

&gt; 5. what if we voted for the deal- when would that be implemented?

&gt; 6. if we voted leave, when would that be implemented?

That would be up to the government/EU to agree and put forward. Could be within days or a fortnight or a few months, hopefully giving businesses time to make preparations.

&gt; 7. what if countries were divided again?- England and Wales voted Leave in 2016, Scotland and Northern Ireland voted Remain. How would this be sorted?

Much as it is now, they may choose to leave the United Kingdom to pursue a relationship with the EU (or perhaps to leave the EU, if you can imagine that).

&gt; 8. when will we be able to vote regarding the EU membership again? - will this be a generational thing? Example: 1975 - a generation then 2016- just over a generation. ?

Presumably whenever the sitting government decides it wants to ask the people for guidance again, no limits are necessary here. If the government tries to pester the people endlessly to leave (or rejoin, if the invitation were ever extended) I can’t imagine the public would respond very well.

&gt; 9. how can we trust parliament to enact any decision given that they have failed to implement something that the public wished and as to which they had said they would implement it, 3 years ago... Again that whole thing about 'worrying precedent'.

Returning to the public which voted in an advisory referendum with a clear enactable plan for leaving based on their recommendation, to then ask them if this is what they voted for and would still choose would be a wonderful precedent to set. One vague binary non-binding referendum followed by a clear binding referendum with actionable choices would be the logical way to approach understanding and implementing “the will of the people”.",,/r/europe/comments/czi0xr/timeline_of_uks_governments_majority/eyzfkbx/,BitchesLoveDownvote,1567616597

1707,"Probably both. Johnson might have a fourth meaningful vote and might attempt to call a GE. However what's happening here is that he is trying to call Corbyn's bluff: Corbyn's previous two voncs failed because Remainers refused to vote for him so Johnson flipped it around and is purging the Remainers, daring them to vote for him if they want an extension. It's stupid but is likely to work in his favor. End result will be him flying to Brussels, crying how everyone is mean to him, and being told an extension will only be granted if A50 is repealed (something he can do without MPs). He will then blame Brussels for everything and crashout, using the manufactured crisis to impose some sort of martial law in NI.

The current ""no deal"" bill is absolutely pointless so just ignore it. MPs have approved at least four or five similar bills over the past year, it literally doesn't matter. Them taking control of the agenda doesn't matter either when Boris already suspended parliament. What matters is if they vote to repeal A50. That is the only thing of consequence right now, the defect Tories are still not enough because Lab is split on the issue too.

3) Even you would be right on that, what proportion of those suicides are made by gays? Seriously. Other groups meet much bigger difficulties then LGTBTQFK+. And yes, I know trans suicide rates in USA are huuuuge, but what percent of whole population in LT are Trans people? :D What percent of suiciding people are trans people? Seriously.

Why? Let's just ignore digital services because they are much harder to measure - but they also make up a tiny part of imports.

They also (at least in Russia) know revenue from sales. So they know prices. And can account for these luxury goods in PPP calculations.

In reality Switzerland's success story began much earlier. One of the main reasons why Switzerland became economically successful was a relatively early industrialization process compared to other (mainland) countries in Europe. In certain areas Switzerland was even outcompeting the UK, which is rightfully regarded as the pacemaker of industrialization. As the country had no natural resources and relatively ""bad"" soil, the industry always focused on manufacturing of specialized/niche products and targeted the export market. As such, already in the 18th century some regions of Switzerland were amongst the most prosperous in Europe. Economic growth was slowed down after/during the French revolution in the late 18th century, and when France occupied the Helvetic republic, but in the end the economy was able to recover and innovate quite rapidly.

Another important development was the adaptation of this early/pioneering phase of industrialization to other industrial branches during the late 19th century, e.g. engineering, chemistry, or the electronics industry. This adaption was not as successfully implemented in all European countries, while the UK struggled a lot, Germany and Switzerland were more successful. Both countries recognized the potential and importance of technical training for industry early on. In Switzerland the federal institute of technology was established (also known as ETH Zurich) to satisfy the demand of the industry, which in the end helped the country to flourish economically.",,/r/europe/comments/cz3e25/switzerland_empathises_with_uk_on_eu_dogmatism/eyzgw1n/,curiossceptic,1567617452

so no real free market then, we had free market capitalism before, without socialist aspects like wealth redistribution and proper public services, aka socialism.

true, but it seems the west did somewhat socialise in response, after the war communists were much more popular and were winning elections.

Yes... but that's clearly incorrect. Somerset Capital Management HQ is, and will remain, in London. They're opening a fund in Ireland. This really isn't complicated, I can only assume you have no idea what an investment firm is?

Fascinating.

2186,"&gt; He took a group of ragtag soilders

This is taking some credits away from those soldiers. Napoleon didn't turn them from peasants to glorious warriors, and it's a common misconception.

The Italian front was much less intense and important than the Northern front (Germany and Benelux). Its lower importance is also why Napoleon was able to get a command, early in his career.

But the lesser intensity of the conflict means that soldiers, while hugely under equipped, were quite experienced by years of conflicts. This is opposed to the soldiers on the Northern front where the fights were bloodier and troops didn't get a lot of time to get experience (as they were dying too fast...).

It was those soldiers' experience that enables Napoleon to use them as he did, with his genius military tactics. One big achievement of Napoleon with this army is also how he managed to motivate them (victories also help, true), and of course the various tactics he used.

Especially considering that that crap will eventually break down into methane and CO2 as well. Also for every bit of energy you get out of burning waste you need to burn less coal/oil/gas and can instead keep it in the ground.

And while the term 'thermal recycling' is very much a meme around here I consider it a totally valid approach. Think  about it: would you rather burn fossil fuels directly, or first utilise them in form of plastic for years to come before finally extracting their energy in a waste burning plant? The second option just is in every way superior and more environmentally friendly.

And even if the entire energymix is entirely renewables I would still advocate for burning waste. It leaves only a fraction of total waste volume and mass, and safely reduces down any toxic organic compounds into relatively save CO2. Even if the world would burn it's entire waste every year, we're merely looking at around 5% of current CO2 emission levels. That is an amount which can totally be controlled longterm  maybe even scrubbing the co2 right after burning it befor letting it dilute into the atmosphere.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/cz8g04/italys_five_star_members_back_deal_for_new/eyyctzy/,UmdieEcke2,1567580614

2242,"Even risking the downvote to hell, I'll try to explain why I personally do not support the HK movement.

Disclaimer, I'm in favour of democracy, and ALL regions in the world should have the right to decide in a vote if they want to be independent, that includes HK and, for a polenic instance, Crimea. All of them have the right to do so, but I may not support their movements.

Now, why some people in HK do not want to be part of China? This started with the extradition laws. Knowing how rich people uses HK as a tax heaven of some sort, I really understand why china would want to end that. 

Xi Jinping is hated on internet, you know why? First ask yourself, did you know the name of the previous Chinese president, he is only in office since 2013, why the previous president was not known, were things better in China or worse? My analysis is that the main goal of Xi is his campaign against corruption in China, there are many rich people who is very sore about that and they had started a campaign against him. That's why you know his name. And now that the anti-corruption campaign is touching HK, where many rich corrupt people not only in China but all over the world operate, the anti-Xi campaign had intensified. I've seen this kind of defamatory campaigns all over the world, and nowadays I can smell some rich-guy paid campaign from miles ahead.

So there's that, while I support they right to decide for themselves whether they are independent or not in a referendum, I really think that things will be worst both for HK and for the world if HK not only separes fron China, but also if they don't apply the extradition law.

This is my opinion, based on my analysis of the situation, anyone pay me for saying this, I'm not chinese, and it's just my logical conclusion after trying to be as informed as I can in this matter.

As I said earlier I risk the downvote to oblivion for expressing that I not have the mainstream reddit-western opinion, but I hope I could make someone understand at least why some people may differ in a matter that seems so straight forward for others.",Spanish Republic,/r/europe/comments/cyu01o/a_group_of_chinese_people_held_up_a_sign_saying/eyydgwk/,yonosoytonto,1567581493

If Corbyn and / or the Labour exec don't think they'll win then it would make more sense to focus on blocking no deal (assuming they want that) and getting to a position to win a GE at a later date.

Boris remains in power, his backers rejoice and Putin says mission accomplished.


So the opposition, knowing this is would be his strategy to force no-deal Brexit... is wisely stating that they will block the motion for a general election until an extension is passed.

2356,"&gt; Those who believe in the free-speech-crisis myth fail to make the distinction between “fighting” words and speech that facilitates communication; between free speech and absolute speech.  Using this litmus test, the first hint that the free speech crisis is actually an absolute speech crisis is the issues it focuses on. On university campuses, it is overwhelmingly race and gender. On social media, the free speech axe is wielded by trolls, Islamophobes and misogynists, leading to an abuse epidemic that platforms have failed to curb.

""Fighting words"" are a US legal concept.

At one time, there was a concept in the US of speech that would likely result in immediate violence against the speaker.  Think of, oh, I don't know, calling someone's mother a whore in a rough-and-tumble mining town or something -- the point of the words *was* to provoke a physical fight -- hence, ""fighting words"".  The idea was that it was unrealistic to expect someone not to attack at that point, and because the violence was so immediate, there was nothing else that law could do but permit such a restriction to exist.  Over time, society's adjusted to the idea that it is *not* unreasonable to expect people to refrain from punching/stabbing/shooting the speaker, even if he's aiming to provoke a fight.

The Supreme Court has narrowed the scope of ""fighting words"" to such an extent that I would say that it is arguable that the concept no longer exists.  That's not random people online, that's case law.

And I'm pretty sure that there was no point at which the doctrine ever extended to something like social media, where no form of immediate physical violence was possible (well, okay, unless you've got a bunch of people in a bar and they're Tweeting things at each other or something, but you get the point).

(And personally, when I was in university, I failed to see this vast ocean of sexism in which universities are innundated to which *The Guardian* refers.  In fact, I have something of a difficult time believing that universities are much of an example of intolerance at all relative to society as a whole.)

*The Guardian* can advocate for Brits to do whatever, which may well included a less-permissive speech environment than the US, but if it plans to try to describe how free speech works in the United States and not get called out on it, it's going to have to actually do its homework prior to articles.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cz3qt7/the_myth_of_the_free_speech_crisis_how_overblown/eyy8a3i/,vokegaf,1567575037

What to do next, if anything was never part of the referendum. And there is nothing at all in the law that forces the government to go through with it.

The obvious thing to do, especially since Parliament can’t agree a way forward, is to take the negotiated deal back to people in a referendum and say “Okay, so, this is what it looks like to leave.

2468,"It's not as easy as ""if you don't want a deal, get out of it/don't take it"". In some aspects the reality is that borders don't mean anything at this point in time.

E.g. look at electrical current flows in Europe, they follow the laws of physics and don't stop at the borders. As such it is important for the grid operator(s) to work together with their neighbors to maintain and ensure a stable grid. Factually, a large portion (i think around 30%) of all electrical power flows in western and central Europe use the Swiss grid. Despite of Switzerland being fully integrated into this common energy market from a technical point of view, the EU does not want Switzerland to be legally integrated in the energy market and it does treat Switzerland like a third party in many aspects.

This can have some serious consequences, and it does lead to increased destabilization of the grid in Switzerland, e.g. when energy flows rapidly and unexpectedly change (such a blackout was prevented earlier this year). It's important to point out that Swiss grid (in)stability does not only affect people living in Switzerland, but also people living as direct neighbors of Switzerland.

So why is this happening? Because the EU wants Switzerland to sign an unrelated framework agreement, only then it will talk about integrating Switzerland fully in the energy market. Personally, I find this a really questionable political move by the EU, using the stability of electrical power supply of a country and surrounding regions, to pressure a country to sign an unrelated framework agreement.",,/r/europe/comments/cz3e25/switzerland_empathises_with_uk_on_eu_dogmatism/eyy2cxs/,curiossceptic,1567569142

2551,"What data did you use for the Netherlands? CBS data from 2015 shows that for example the historically largely Protestant province of Noord Holland has twice the amount of Catholics compared to Protestants (16% against 8%, with irreligion at 63%) due to the higher rate of secularisation among the latter. Now the very low percentage and religious history of the province would make it weird to show it as Catholic but if that is purely what you're going for then it should be red. Gelderland should really have a Catholic minority at least, it's pretty fifty/fifty and has been for a while with 21.6% Catholic vs 23.2% Protestant (and again irreligion beats both at 46%).

Overijssel on the other hand has 26.1% Protestant against 23.3% Catholic so it should be switched (or in the same 50/50 category as Gelderland)

&amp;#x200B;

Leaving out irreligion, which beats any religion in all provinces but Noord Brabant and Limburg, you get this from the 2015 data (Catholic|Protestant|Islam|Other):

* Groningen: 15.5|59.1|4.1|19.3
* Friesland: 15.4|66.6|2.6|14.5
* Drenthe: 24.4|62.7|2.4|9.4
* Overijssel: 40.3|45.2|5.0|8.8
* Flevoland: 27.2|34.6|16.1|18.8
* Gelderland: 40.2|43.2|6.7|9.1
* Utrecht: 28.9|44.5|12.3|12.5
* Noord Holland: 43.9|21.3|17.8|12.7
* Zuid Holland: 30.3|38.1|15.7|10.7

* Noord Brabant: 78.4|9.2|7.2|4.1
* Limburg: 89.5|3.1|4.6|2.2

Note that the ""Other"" category does not include Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism, they have their own categories in the census but they are largely insignificant (Hinduism at 3.8 of all religious in Zuid Holland being by far the highest percentage).

2578,"&gt;  because they want self determination and not to have economic and political rules set by a bunch of unelected officials that they cannot relate to or directly elect. 

That happens either way. Regardless, the EU resolves cross border disputes and disputes over shared resources, in fact it literally resolved a bunch of issues for Britain like the border with Ireland and the cod wars between them, Iceland and mainland Europe. Leaving does nothing for Britain but add more complications and disputes. 

&gt; The vitriol I have heard coming from the remain side is pathetic for three years they have beaten the same desperate drum trying to say people lied or people don't understand.

If Brexit was a good idea it would have been pushed through by now and Theresa May would be lapping around Parliament with a Conservative Majority being hailed as the second Thatcher. Instead we have Boris Johnson in parliament and he just lost his majority, and seems to have accidentally overplayed his hand and now Brexit is on the verge of not even happening. 

&gt; I have heard people say things such as ""the insults aren't aimed at you guys its the government"" while simultaneously insulting everyone who doesn't agree with them and dehumanising them as they are on the other tribe. We have been bombarded with scare stories with a remain slant from all the big news and corporate sources trying to change peoples opinion for years now.

Literally the opposite happened. Conservative outlets and billionaires bombarded the UK with outright lies about the EU and focused on refugees. 

&gt; What is so strange about this is that people think if we are not in the EU then we are not europeans and we don't like the people on the continent, its moronic this wasn't a vote of hate it was a vote of self government and accountability.

You already had self government and are gaining nothing. The UK had disputes with the EU and they resolved them in favor of the UK. The UK didn't join the Eurozone, it didn't take in as many refugees as other states did. The EU gave Britain preferential treatment and the billionaires  The whole point of the EU is to have a closer customs union so that free trade is far easier. It's not perfect and has its flaws, but it has nothing to do with ""self government"" and ""accountability"". 

&gt; I don't know anyone who voted for Brexit that hates europeans they just don't want to be part of a super state and to have a smaller accountable government. its not really that hard to comprehend. I know I will probably get lots of downvotes as this sub is against Brexit and the people that voted for it.

lol ""small accountable government"", nice one! Now, as far as I've seen, the EU tends to do pretty well on privacy rights, with some of the best privacy protections in the world. far better than America which has a ""small accountable government"". 

I've seen this argument about ""small government"" a lot, but almost everytime, the people saying ""small government"" really mean ""I want a big government, just one with more weapons and less welfare"".

2642,"&gt; The 'agreement' was always conditional on Parliamentary approval. 

There was no such condition to pass the withdrawal agreement, just that parliament was expected to pass it. There are certain obligations that have to be accounted for so the EU can not simply renegotiate every time that the deal gets rejected.

&gt;It means something that doesn't have the approval of public or their elected representatives. 

No it doesn’t, all that democracy means is that the public have some input. Usually by appointment of representatives through elections. Democratic governments quite often make pretty unpopular decisions. 

&gt;And putting a regulatory border between NI and the Mainland, which the backstop would entail

That form of the backstop was declined, in order to satisfy the DUP. Besides there already are different regulations from NI to the mainland and it doesn’t create anywhere near the same tensions as border in Ireland does.

&gt;Brussels have been pushing the ideology of Sinn Fein/IRA, with callous disregard for the Unionist majority. 

No they are looking out for the interest of a member state, the interests of the people involved and the obligations that there are. It is nothing to do with Sinn Fein and [most people in Northern Ireland support it] (https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/northern-ireland-voters-back-brexit-backstop-lbrjn0f5g). [Northern Ireland also is not that far off from a Catholic majority] (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-43823506).

&gt;The UK also needs to protect its integrity.

It doesn’t threaten the UK’s integrity, it is well in the UK’s ability to give special status to one region. While the EU has clear rules governing its institutions.

&gt;I know Dublin has trouble understanding that NI isn't part of their country, but it isn't. 

The Irish government fully understands that.

&gt;The UK government has been working closely with NI's elected representatives, who strongly oppose the backstop.

The DUP aren’t really that representative of the Northern Irish population. The reason that they have the kind of power is due to sectarianism.

2668,"&gt;Well Western Europe doesn't need anyone to protect them. But the situation is quite different for, say, Estonia.

Estonia might need to worry about meddling, but invasion? not a chance as long as they are part of EU and NATO.

&gt;Well what's the alternative? What can a small country like Estonia or Latvia rely on? NATO may not be a perfect guarantee for safety, but it is better than nothing.

An alternative could be better defence cooperation within the EU.

&gt;or turned them into puppet states.

Right.

&gt;Btw, my country does not rely on the US on defence. We have our own army, and it's not very big, but it's the only thing we can truly trust. But personally I think we should join NATO, it would be an additional guarantee for safety.

It only has to be big enough so that it cost more to invade than what can be gained. Look at Afghanistan, a really poor country, attacking them has been a major failure for the US. Look at Georgia and the Ukraine, poor countries yet Russia can't just roll in and takeover. 

Joining NATO just means you will be pulled into a war if something happens to Turkey or the US. If you don't join there's at least a chance to not get involved. And we don't benefit from an arms race with Russia, it just makes the region less safe.

2738,"The short story.

Boris Johnson became MP recently after Theresa May stepped down. She stepped down because she could not get Parliament to agree on a deal.

Boris Johnson has been a proponent of Brexit and wants a ""NO DEAL.""

Since becoming Prime Minister the Conservative Party has been slipping in the polls while the Labour party has been steadily increasing.

Boris Johnson lost his majority in Parliament today when a Conservative member, in the middle of Johnson's speech, walked across the aisle. According to rumors, there are more Conservatives who plan on defecting to the other side.

This brings us to the present.

Parliament/ The Labour party is hoping to vote on a bill making a NO DEAL illegal. Additionally, during this week there will likely be a vote of No Confidence in Boris Johnson. This will most likely lead to another general election which given the changes in the polls will only strengthen the Labour party.

If the Labour party succeeds Jeremey Corbyn will likely become new PM and the Labour party will both ask for an extension on Brexit and most likely hold a second referendum. Which again going back to polls far more people in Great Britain now oppose.

Again this is what UK news correspondents/ politicians feel what will happen but who knows. The only thing for sure is that the next year in UK politics is going to continue to be a mess all while a recession inches closer.

2898,"&gt; Solar and wind are not really the cheapest options as these kinds of things get more expensive per unit at smaller scales it becomes a lot less financially viable.

Not true. Home solar is a thing, you know? Wind does need a larger scale to work, but we're not talking about anything absurd, a couple thousand homes are enough.

&gt; Land availability is also an issue, many islands are either very densely populated, often to the point where placing wind turbines onshore or even in some near-shore locations would break regulations.

Malta is the exception, not the rule. None of the islands involved in this project are particularly highly densely populated.

&gt; While you can put solar on top of buildings there are still a lot of resultant limitations. You also need to consider that a lot of the leftover land will be green space, which often can't be developed on.

Yep, that is the solution for densely populated islands: rooftop solar and offshore wind. 

&gt; You might be able to go offshore but offshore wind turbines are considerably more expensive per unit produced and these turbines are generally larger, so for smaller islands they make even less sense as they're overkill.

So you have in mind an island that is so densely populated that you can't build onshore wind, but the population is so low that offshore wind isn't viable? May I ask which is this mythical island? Somewhere with a single house balancing on a rock?

&gt; So to make any island run entirely on renewables, discounting islands which can use geothermal or hydro energy, you need a mixed generation method with excessive production with some form of again fairly excessive energy storage and either some kind of hydrogen powered backup or a power link to the mainland.

Ah yeah right, the old disinformation spread by fossil fuel industry that a 100% renewable grid isn't possible/viable/desirable. I can't wait for the projects to be implemented and rub them on your face.

/u/v_bomberj11 made the most information rich comment below, which I repeat here.

&gt; &gt; Aolus orbits at 320 km, which is way below the functioning Starlink constellation. This suggests the satellite in question is one of the failed satellites that is being deorbited.
&gt; 
&gt; Properly functioning Starlink satellites have uploaded into their navigation systems, the database (or the relevant portion of the database) that the USAF maintains of satellites and space debris. Starlink satellites automatically perform avoidance maneuvers, hours or days in advance. The same database is used to prevent radio beams from interfering with other satellites. So we have been told by Spacex.
&gt; 
&gt; It could be that the dying Starlink satellite has limited maneuvering capability. It could be that the Starlink satellite also performed an avoidance maneuver, and Spacex did not broadcast the news. Last, it is possible though not likely that the Starlink satellite only had data on other objects for the neighborhood of its target orbit, so it didn’t know to avoid Aolus.
&gt; 
&gt; There needs to be a system of notification and coordination between operators, for avoidance maneuvers, to prevent 2 satellites both dodging the same direction. In this case, since the Starlink satellite in question was deorbiting, raising orbit for Aolus was the obvious best choice.",Secretly Norwegian,/r/europe/comments/cz3joe/spacex_refused_to_move_a_starlink_satellite_at/eyw8r4h/,Victor4X,1567523672

I'm aware there are warning of shortages for a couple of months after Brexit for various reasons and that's going to be the most troublesome time.

The UK could well break up, NI can go any time they want, and they may be nearing that point.  Scotland probably would win an independence vote post Brexit, whether or not they'll get the chance I have no idea.  It might sound strange but I think the best situation for people living in Britain is for NI to join the ROI, it would solve a lot of problems at least on our end.

If Scotland leaves it's going to be very awkward because they have to sort out who's going to own what assets and it'll be far more complicated than Brexit.  It's not like Scotland's in a position to take whatever it wants and I can see a lot of disagreements happening, especially over the North Sea oil.

Preserving the union is important in terms of objective global power but honestly at this point the UK isn't much of a global power anyway, so I don't think that's important.

Anyways, since Croatia has an exclave, it also means that the territory of EU got its first exclave and it's sort of important for Brussels to link these two pieces of land together and ultimately make a decent highway along the coast of Adriatic which would properly link Croatia with Montenegro, Albania and Greece, which is of course another EU member.

3395,"&gt; You aren't in economic class I presume. Norway and Denmark are capitalist countries with socialist benefits.

So why were they not destroyed by those socialist benefits? 

&gt; It's weird that you don't understand the difference. In Denmark, the capitalist market dictates the prices. if there is more demand for food, capitalist people will flock in to make a profit by importing cheap food, hence prices will adjust and go down, people have food to eat.

&gt; In socialist Venezuela the government says: this is the price. It's fixed. Want to import food for a profit? You go to prison. It's illegal. On and BTW, we are super inefficient to bring food, so how about private smart companies help out for a profit share? Nope illegal. F the people no food.

If that is the depth and quality of your understanding then your economic class should be cancelled. Socialism is a lot more than just ""government sets the price for food"". This is absurd.

What makes Venezuela socialist? The abuse of power by a corrupt elite? That's hardly a socialist thing.

https://www.ozy.com/flashback/venezuelas-downfall-isnt-about-socialism-its-about-oil/92669

&gt; At the beginning of February 1989, after celebrating his re-election with an extremely lavish ceremony, President Pérez — who in his first term of presidency became so notorious for his reliance on oil that he was dubbed the Saudi Venezuelan — promised to reject the prospect of an International Monetary Fund and never subject Venezuelans to austerity measures. Yet on Feb. 17, he shocked both his party and the nation with his announcement that Venezuela was about to experience El Gran Viraje (the Great Turn), the IMF-recommended liberalization of its economy and an end to the great social projects of the state. Austerity was to be the rule of the day as the government attempted to pay off Venezuela’s massive debt incurred when oil prices fell in the mid-1980s. No mention was made of curbing Venezuela’s massive corruption, which the populace was well aware of thanks to Pérez’s liberalization of the press.

Is the IMF a socialist organization?

3447,"\2. Weak, most definitely not. Technologically inferior, definitely so, and that ties into what you're alluding to (and what I alluded to when talking about communists maybe wanting to wipe out nazis first). Dig through the sources on the supposed communist attack westwards once again and note the tech composition. Reich higher-ups were shaken in the first days of war at the sheer amount of burnt and blown up tech they had encountered in the border regions. What was the quote, ""I wouldn't have believed you yesterday had you told me a country could field 25 thousand tanks to start a war with""? However, try to dig deeper to find a qualitive comparison to German forces. (I settled down for our MoD's history institute's publication, [""USSR armed forces' composition throughout the Great Ward for the Fatherland (1941-1945). Statistics digest 1 (June 22nd 1941).""](http://istmat.info/node/44934), quite the comprehensive source written apparently by the MoD for the MoD, going by that a grand total of 25 copies were printed.) If you do, you may find that ~26 thousand tanks may have been on USSR's hands at the start of the war, out of which KVs and T-34s (the technologically up-to-date ones) comprised ~500 and ~900 respectively, while T-26 and BTs seem to have accounted for ~16 thousands together. Those were pretty outdated, T-26s especially. BTs could at least use their mobility to outrun infantry and cut supply lines, pretty much acting like advanced cavalry. The grand summary is that USSR was lacking in tech at the start of the war. Hell, USSR traded German tech for its industrial power and resources to get its hands on at least something.

I kinda agree with that, more because it's a pipe dream/basically impossible, though.

I mean, France is maybe the most centralized state of Europe today, and it stems from a long history, as such, there has been some efforts that have been described as attempts to ""kill"" regional identities, especially language (btw, personally, I don't think it was really a move against regional identities, but I've seen it described that way), and it ended up in failure. 

Or if you try, it's probably going to be like the various instance of ethnic cleansings we saw in the 20th century. (Do note than plenty of thoses failed too)

Anywya, you can't erase culture that easily.

That being said, I didn't even see even the most pro-federalist/pro-eu people say that EU should become more unicultural, even if they try to promote an European identity. They still put ""Diversity is our strength"" as a slogan for the EU, after all, even if in practice, it doesn't show that much

Also, the EU moved past the economical union since 1992, you know ?

&gt; I as an individual am polite, just as you, but we should never call it a cultural difference

I wasn’t using ‘you’ in the personal sense, but for that of people in general who support this- a large number of which will include meat eaters. If every animal has to be instantaneously unconcious before being killed for you (that’s not a personal ‘you’, to be clear) to feel morally sanctified in eating meat, that’s a problem whichever way.

&gt; We're not as buzzword happy in Europe as you are in America. If you think I'm going to swiftly change my position because you've strong-armed me into having to defend myself against allegations of Nazism you're pretty freaking wrong.

I think it’s interesting when you look at who supports these laws and some of the rhetoric used to describe the people involved. It’s a good reminder of how quickly people established for centuries can become less than human in the eyes of their countrymen over the excuse of something so trivial. By the way, feel no compulsion from me to change your outlook; as I said above, the US benefits from Europe’s intolerance.

&gt; So because foie gras exists - which is an honestly despicable practice - we shouldn't address other despicable practices?

It’s curious that there are people so into animal rights that they’re casting others as barbarians or scum while quibbling over two extremely quick slaughter methods, but yet think nothing of grazing away on livers derived from constantly force feeding animals over their life because that’s OK in their own culture.

Not in 2019. Now nationalist countries are absolutely content with simply being able to close their borders, staying put and to preserve their society they way they want it and not have drastic change to be forced down their throats. Do you really think Poland and Hungary want to wage wars of conquest? No. Their war is to keep their country in tact that way they like it and to resist places like Germany trying to force demographic change upon them.

Also, you are speaking a lot of conjecture. Nationalism doesn't always imply you think your country is better than others.

The Western countries are the ones who put more money on it but are also the ones who get the decisions power, specially economic decisions that in a single monetary market with a monetary policy that suites the Western Industrialised countries economy. The money the Western Europe put in the EU is nothing compared the low cost of living they get thanks to the Eastern and Mediterranean EU countries driving the value of the Euro down due to their lower industrialised economy. Thanks to it Germany is able export industrial goods worldwide  (specially to China industries) with lower costs of their high quality products, making German the country with the highest economic surplus. So the money they put in the EU is not for mere solidarity. The German economic surplus hurts other countries economy, including their EU countries.

3758,"&gt; Oh wow. I had no idea other countries paid for that. I suppose that was because it was a UN mission.

Yes, that's one of the reasons. In Germany's case, there are two more: 

* Bush the Elder just asked for it. Back in 1991, just after the Reunification and the *big* role Bush had had in bringing it about, there was absolutely no way Germans would've said no to him, whatever it was. As I've said, that's how the the ""solidarity surcharge"" came about: It originally meant 'solidarity with our allies'.

* The Soviet Union hadn't yet ratified the Two-plus-Four Treaty. It did in March 1991, whilst the Desert Storm began in January. Initially, Helmut Kohl was all gung-ho about it until he was told that it raises potential constitutional questions (and besides could be viewed as an affront by the Soviets) if he jumped head-on into a war.

&gt; So like the Bundestag can pass a surcharge without the Bundesrat approving whereas they would need both to approve a normal income tax change?

Yes. Actually, the income tax is a 'community tax', meaning its proceeds belong to both the federal treasury as well as the states. Both have to agree to any change.

&gt; How do you challenge that?

Well, either grounds of constitutionality (which is quite rare) or in an entirely separate branch of our judiciary (the *Finance Courts* with the [Federal Fiscal Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Fiscal_Court) at the helm).",Charlemagnia - personally vouching for /u/-ah,/r/europe/comments/cytmxs/solidarity_tax_in_germany/eyuwzzr/,ColourFox,1567474401

3844,"“I think Montgomery is grossly overrated as a military leader and his political ineptitude is absolutely breathtaking. How he ever became the chief of the Imperial General Staff after the Second World War beggars the imagination.”-David Cesarani

“Well, Montgomery, shall we say, certainly overrated himself. After the war he claimed that he should be treated on the same level as Wellington and Marlborough. I mean, that was preposterous. Monty was a very good trainer of troops, he was also good for increasing determination and the fighting spirit, but as a commander, he was very 'staff-cology' as Ismay would have said. Everything had to be done in a very coherent and logical fashion, and he was not quick. And the whole idea that Monty should lead the charge into Germany rather than Patton was a preposterous idea, and the Americans certainly felt that very much themselves. So shall we say he was the most self-overrated general of the war.” Antony Beevor.

""First of all he's a psychopath, Don't forget that. He is such an egocentric that the man thinks... everything he has ever done is perfect -- has never made a mistake in his life, and on top of that he is just a... His memory is bad, very bad, but he thinks it's perfect, so I don't... He even says that all the tactical operations after he landed from D-Day went absolutely according to plan."" -Eisenhower

I personally think of Monty as pretty akin to Douglas MacArthur, good but not great commanders with giant egos, whose early successes made them heroes to the people back home, and essentially un-fireable. Late in the war they were largely a detriment to the war effort as a whole being as high ranking as they were, but public opinion kept them in their positions.

3848,"Given the choice between Boris's Conservative administration or the very real chance of Jermey Corybn being put into power they will make a deal very quickly. Theres no way Farage would put himself in the position of getting rid of the main stream political administration delivering the closest thing to a hard brexit and replacing it with a pro-remain alliance headed by someone who would do so much damage to private industry Brexit would become a small footnote in this decades history.

I could be wrong but I think they will agree that the Brexit party stands down in convservative contested areas while the Conservatives will agree not to field any candidates in areas where they have no realistic chance of winning thus giving the Brexit party a chance to get a few seats. Farage has already pretty much agreed to this providing No Deal brexit is on the table and right now it looks like the most likely outcome.

Likewise though the remain-alliance are going to do something similar but due to FPTP voting they are basically in the situation where tactical voting would only allow them to pull seats from each-other.

The number of citizens per electoral vote is change to infrequently and the differences are to big. Your vote can’t mean 10 times less than your fellow citizens. Also, while “bigger” states may be treated worse, which may be good for them not to dominate, as you say, sadly the “wealthier” criteria is not there. The states treated worst due to the slow changes in the system are the middle class ones gaining population from conservative Utah, Arizona and Wyoming to liberal New Mexico, Colorado or Nevada. The old money states, with all the lobbyists etc, as in the Northeastern states, like New England and a bit further south are the ones who have it bests, as those are very small. But very rich. So the system is almost a XIXth century one at times, as the rich white dude from Connecticut or Vermont has a vote that means much more than that of a Hispanic guy from New Mexico. 

So it would only be good if it was updated according to population ANNUALLY.

Also, it is nothing like the EU parliament vote system, which really means small EU countries have a voice, and that is due to the distribution of money and power in the US.

I'll repeat. When you tell people to stop having children since it's better for the environment, you will select for people that don't give a shit about the environment to reproduce and spread their behaviour, leading to generations of people who don't care about the environment since they're the only ones who had children.

&gt; People are having fewer or no kids regardless of climate change.

4066,"&gt; And yet France that relies heavily on nuclear has among the lowest energy prices in Western Europe.

And very high taxes, it's notoriously hard to account for nuclear funding in France, not in the least because of it being intertwined with military interests. So the actual user price is merely an accounting choice, it's not an accurate reflection of the real costs.

&gt;But yeah nowadays building a new reactor is disproportionately expensive compared to just popping up the same in renewable capacity. Then again prices would probably be lower if countries werent just building 1-2 but 10-20 new plants. Economies of scale is most important here.

Something where renewables have a natural advantage. If one or two solar panels in hundred roll off the assembly line with a defect, no big deal. But that kind of errors are not really acceptable when it comes to the equipment that needs to contain the reaction.

&gt;My biggest issue is that we will new something to provide base load for the times when the sun is down and the wind for some reason isnt blowing a lot. Some of that can be counteracted with battery storage but not enough for an actual backup of at least 24 hours. At least with todays tech. In 2030 who knows.

Storage tech is improving hand over feet thanks to the expected quantities of renewables, so that seems to work out.

Nuclear plants, from their part, also can be down. For example, in Belgium last winter 6 out of 7 reactors were down for an extended period. So it's not only renewable that needs backup.

I'm assuming from the example that you think I'm describing the situation in a way that is somewhat 'correct', but not accurate to the truth?

Well, the Taliban were openly allowing Al-Qaeda to function, but they were also amenable to dialogue with Americans when it came to handing over Osama bin Laden, and the justification using Article 51 of the UN charter is doubtful, considering Al-Qaeda were non-state actors.With the American cassus belli being doubtful, the use of Article 5 for NATO was as well.  Now, this may not impact how the US war effort in Afghanistan was conducted, but it does make a case that the US started this war, and called upon it's allies, when the condition for it were very doubtful. It also makes it grating that the US than blames the people they invaded and the allies they dragged along for it.

So, from what I remember when it actually it happened, I don't know where you get the World War II example, except that you're so ignorant of the actual events and history, that you default to that period of history and American worship.

Arboriculturist and winegrower since 1992 in the commune of Glun in the Ardèche, he had never experienced a hail episode like this one. The size of the hail severely damaged the fruit. Result: impossible to sell them through your cooperative. ""Industrialists don't want it, there are too many injuries on apricots,"" he says.

What should we do with these tons of fruit that have been made unsaleable but still edible? Refusing to accept food waste, Régis Gonnet organized on July 16, with members of the Confédération paysanne, an action of ""solidarity collection"" on his plots. The idea: to help families in need by redistributing the fruit to local associations: Secours populaire, Réseau éducation sans frontières, Restos du cœur, Secours catholique, Confits du cœur de Romans, Banque alimentaire...

About twenty people from these networks, some of whom were food aid beneficiaries, came to help during the collection. In total, 1.2 tonnes of apricots were picked, some of which will be distributed and some of which will be processed into jams. ""We recovered about 10% of what was on the trees,"" says Régis. We picked up what could be preserved, and we left everything that was too mature or too affected. It was important for us to give rather pretty fruits. »

For the future, Régis Gonnet is in uncertainty. Like most farmers, it is not insured - only 3% of arborists were covered by insurance according to the latest available data[1]. The high cost of insurance combined with the difficulty of obtaining compensation are many pitfalls[2]. This is the bitter assessment made by Marc Bissardon, arborist at Chagnon in the Loire. ""Initially, we had freeze insurance, but it became more and more expensive. When 60% of our production was affected by hail, insurers showed us the damaged fruit and said we could benefit from it. ""Since then, Marc and his partner have decided not to take on insurance but to play on the diversity of their production in quite different places.

In the aftermath of the hail episode in mid-June, Agriculture Minister Didier Guillaume promised exceptional emergency aid. ""We have been calling on the Ministry for a month now to ensure that the statements made by the Minister on 16 June do not remain a dead letter and that he makes a concrete and financial commitment to help the affected farmers,"" the Confédération paysanne de l'Ardèche points out in a statement. ""What we are asking for in the future,"" says Régis Gonnet, ""is the establishment of a shared fund managed by the State to insure farmers against climatic events such as we have just seen, rather than the development of a private insurance system that will continue to cause many people in the agricultural world to lose out.

To you, it's obviously personal already, monitoring comments from my recent history. I very much assume that no matter how good my argument is, you won't budge, because it's personal.

This line already tells me everything I needed to know. You are defensive here. You deny my statement, but you're not even confident enough for that and go right to justifying. ""If my statement is true, so what"", you say. You second paragraph even sounds like a tweet from Donald Trump:
 
&gt;No I don't. It's a completely false statement and even if it was true ""sounds like Hitler"" isn't an argument whatsoever.

On the surface it all looked like LLR had weathered the storm by the election in 2015 in which the Liberal party lost a lot of seats but won got government power. LLR bacame prime minister and KJ foreign affairs minister (later switched to minister of finance).  
During the election campaign this spring LLR announced that he wanted to make a Social-democratic/liberal government in order to free himself and the party from the Danish People's Party which had sabotaged basically everything LLR had tried to do as Prime minister.  
KJ did not like this and large part of the party didn't like it either. It's not that KJ is a fan of the Danish People's Party, but he sees them as a necessary evil for the liberal party to get governmental power.  
The election turned out well for the liberal party and especially LLR who got a very good personal result, while KJ got a bad personal result. Most people thought that LLR's position was secure mostly due to KJ weakness.

Does it matter what the ""goal"" was when the result would have been similar? 

It's clear that Russians only ever liberated themselves, we in the Baltics have nothing to be grateful about. They just grabbed more lands for themselves, to get more sea access, to exploit resources, colonize and Russify more lands. 

The very first things Soviets did after annexation was appropriate almost all property, install heavy censorship, blow up local freedom monuments, deport local ""dissidents"", imprison/execute local leadership etc. There's not even a hint of liberation or the smallest flavour of benevolence.

My take: we're running out of time. We can't afford to stall the research to uncover and explain who are those still buried, where are they and why because the children of those who lost their parents are dying *today*. The longer we wait, the fewer direct witnesses we have and for the record, the more roads and buildings are being built right on top of these mass graves, effectively taking them out of our reach forever. The conservative party in Spain stopped every attempt to continue this research since 2011(!)

It's an aberration to our country, our history and our people to have so many without proper burial or even a known place of burial. And let me be very clear: I don't care if you were in the Socialist party, the CNT, were a priest, wore a blue shirt, had direct link with Stalin or had tea with Franco once. **Everyone** deserves to be known where they lie, explaining who they were and if possible why are they there. Because regardless of side, ideology or social class, no one deserves to be taken in the middle of the night to be shot in God knows where to be buried with another hundred like you.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/cycmzy/one_of_the_various_mass_graves_made_up_of_the/eyswsz2/,PierreLothair,1567415075

It was agreed that the RAF should no longer be bound by any moral or legal scruples to abstain from bombing; Germany's wartime actions, Churchill claimed, had already given the Allies 'ample justification' for retaliation. . . On **13 May** the Cabinet considered again whether the crisis in the Battle of France was severed enough to justify bombing. Though there were arguments against running the risk of German retaliation, **approval was given** for a bombing attack against oil and rail targets in Germany on the night of 14-15 May.

So maybe you can help me - how many territories did Poland ""give"" to Germany before the war and when?

&gt;NATO was everywhere around [Russia]

[Russian land border](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borders_of_Russia) is listed as 20,241 km.

1,253.5 km constitutes just over 6% of the total length of Russian land border. How does that create a situation where NATO is ""everywhere around Russia""?

Or do you mean the meme map with supposed NATO bases everywhere around the world? Maybe so, because it certainly didn't look anywhere close to the actual map available on [NATO website](https://www.nato.int/nato-on-the-map/#lat=57.1948350854216&amp;lon=47.28900516768744&amp;zoom=-1&amp;layer-3).

4693,"&gt; Nuclear power isn't clean. It still leaves us with waste for thousands of years. 

Yes, it does. But imagine that there was a way how to capture all the CO2 and other pollutants generated from a coal power plant, solidify them and store them somewhere. That would be like the holy grail for the coal power. Scientists try to develop carbon capture technologies, people on Reddit support planting trees which do exactly that. Well, nuclear power does that too, all the pollution is safely stored in the waste, can be recycled if it becomes profitable and  

&gt;According to the [International Atomic Energy Agency](http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/manradwa.html) a nuclear reactor which would supply the needs of a city the size of Amsterdam – a 1000MW(e) nuclear power station – produces approximately 30 tonnes of high level solid packed waster per year if the spent fuel is not reprocessed. In comparison, a 1000MW(e) coal plant produces 300,000 tonnes of ash per year.  
&gt;  
&gt;Currently, worldwide, nuclear power generation produces 10,000m3 of high-level waste per year.  [source](http://nuclearinfo.net/Nuclearpower/WebHomeWasteFromNuclearPower)

Meaning that each year we have to dig up a 22m wide cube. That's nothing compared to what humans dig for other construction projects. Yes,  NIMBY is very strong here because what if it leaks or something?

4700,"Shorting is selling stocks you don't own, and then buying them after they went down. Illustration: You sell 1000 stocks at £10 (you need a broker who sells these shares for you, since you don't have them in the first place) and £10,000 appears on your bank account. If they go down 50% after a while, you buy 1000 shares for the lower price of £5, which costs you £5000. So that's a £5000 profit.     
       
Shorting is extremely risky and I can assure you that even very big market players try to avoid the strategy unless they're really convinced a stock will go down. Two problems with shorting:     
    
a) Shares can only go down to zero, in which case in my example the player will earn £1000 in the ""best"" case scenario. But shares can go up double, triple, or quadruple etc. If they quadruple they have to buy back those 1000 shares at £40, or for £40,000. That's a £30,000 loss.        
b) Everybody is looking at the same market. Shares that are weak will already have gone down in price to reflect the Brexit uncertainty. If you've started shorting the past few weeks, the downside is already partly priced into the share prices.  
        
Long story short: Instead of shorting, the big market players will be buying *put options* (options that gamble the share price will be lower in the future), which is less risky as you can ""only"" lose 100% of your investment, and the upside is exponential.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/cybcyt/one_of_the_signs_at_the_protests_against_boris/eysjnhm/,olddoc,1567400609

I wish Poles dealt with their own war crimes in a similar manner that germans did. We are so good at playing the victim card. It's like a national sport in Poland. Being a victim is part of our identity. Yeah, we did get raped left and right. I myself had relatives who died in Auschwitz and in Katyn. Do I blame modern Germans (or Russians) for this? Of course not. Unfortunately, Poles are not so easy in admitting the horrible things they did during the war. Because ya know... We are the holy nation of angles who have never done anything bad.

Instead of rambling about ww2 payouts that is only designed to get political points and get folks reelected, we should maybe work a little harder to forgive and move on?

4840,"Solid effort by the Irish.

Doing some back of the envelope calculations:

2/3 of the trees survive to maturity, giving us ~290-295 million mature trees. Each mature tree absorbs about 20kg of carbon a year, giving a total yearly reduction of (290,000,000*.02) 5,800,000 tonnes of CO2.

Given that Ireland produces around 67,000,000 tonnes  of CO2 a year, this represents around an 8.5% reduction rate just due to reforestation. Given that the Irish are aiming to bring that emissions rate to under 50,000,000 by 2040, this percentage should only increase, and that’s if the reforestation rate itself doesn’t increase.

All in all, it’s a great start that more countries should be pushing.

Under Stalin executions for even small mistakes were routine. Anyone even rumoured to be opposed to Stalin was often arrested and tortured until he agreed to confess to crimes he never commited, on the condition that if he did confess he would be executed, but if he didn't confess then he and his whole family would be executed.

Or  to put it another way, this ""answer"" you give -- and that everyone else  parrots, so it's not your fault -- isn't actually an answer, since all  it does is then raise the follow-up question: So why do men use more  successful methods to kill themselves?

Any of various theories or systems of social organization in which the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or by a centralized government that often plans and controls the economy.

Meaning individuals are more constrained by their government there than say in Europe, US or Australia - and you are wrong saying they are more capitalistic. If you think otherwise, well, you just got your definitions backwards

There is indeed a small portion of women who simply aren't trying to commit suicide, but repeatedly make half-baked ""suicide attempts"" like scratching themselves with forks, or eating a handful of multivitamins, merely as a cry for help and attention. As shown in this article, this small minority of women are responsible for over 50% of suicide attempts - this imbalance in attempted suicide rates is routinely used to brush off the severity of the Male Suicide Epidemic.  


When someone ""attempts suicide"" 17 times by eating a handful of multivitamins, and scratching themselves with a fork, can it really be said that they're attempting suicide? Should we really be counting these statistics as legitimate suicide attempts, comparable with men who's ropes snap when they try to hang themselves to death?

Not being invited for WW2 is embarrassing, not that I particularly blame the EU representatives, but Serbia was the country that got offered peace by Hitler and rejected it with protests ‘Bolje rat nego pakt, bolje grob nego rob’, translating to ‘Rather war than pact, rather grave than slave’.

I don't have either and don't feel any need for it. There are enough intressting things in nature, friends, politics, philosophy, school, work and what not to keep me busy - but nature is the best. But believers tend to have this desperate need for their belief system to have some sort of practical benefit since there's no evidence for the truth of it. Even if there are benefits, these have no bearing on the truth claims and it becomes a question of ""whatever makes me feel good, I will believe is true"" - which is about self centered as one can be. I can imagine believing you are at the center of one or more imagined super being's attention will fullfill some narcissistic need that makes you feel good. Just as getting people's (positive) attention do. With a god you get to decide what opinion it has of you too, which is a bonus.

No deal means WTO rules which means a border for customs checks is needed and thus risks a return of the troubles.

NI will have a majority supporting reunification soon enough, probably by 2025 if not 2030 (based on demographic changes) and Scotland will have gone by then too thanks to Brexit and the push for no deal",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/cyalct/government_could_ignore_law_to_block_nodeal/eyrm7j0/,Tuarangi,1567372245

Lets look at the last 10 PM’s of the UK:

Boris Johnson: PM in 2019. Won 0 GE’s

Theresa May: PM in 2016. Won 1 GE in 2017 . 

David Cameron: PM in 2010. Won 2 GE’s in 2010 (with a coalition government) and 2015. 

Gordon Brown: PM in 2007. Won 0 GE’s. 

Tony Blair: PM in 1997. Won 3 GE’s in 1997, 2001 and 2005. 

John Major: PM in 1990. Won 1 GE in 1992. 

Margaret Thatcher: PM in 1979. Won 3 GE’s in 1979, 1983 and 1987. 

James Callaghan: PM in 1976. Won 0 GE’s.  

Harold Wilson: Pm from 1964-1970 and 1974-1976. Won 4 GE’s in 1964, 1966, 1974 (minority government) and again in 1974. 

Edward Heath: PM in 1970. Won 1 GE in 1970. 


So of the last 10 PM’s (running the UK for the last 55 years);

30% have never won a single General election while leader of their party. 

50% didn’t win a general election to become PM in the first place. 

80% of general elections were won by 4 PM’s all of whom resigned from office before their terms were over. Only 1 of whom actually lost a general election but subsequently became PM again 4 years later before resigning.

And saying that they did nothing is simply  not true there were many dissidents and critics of the regime, but of  course they couldn't do much before they were sent to gulags (at best). 

Exaclty same things were but in opposite direction in those countries that were invided. Yet people there decided to fight back, prepare uprisings and try to change theirs fate.

I and the people who I know did not vote to leave the EU because we blame them for anything except that we are in it! Our domestic woes as you call them were fundamentally caused by the Credit Crunch and the Financial Crisis from which we are just emerging, not by the EU. I personally feel that the Labour government at the time mismanaged that crisis to an extent, though I don't believe that the Conservatives would have done much better given the extent of the problem. 

I think if you actually took some time to speak to people who voted to leave you will find a wide range of reasons why they felt that the UK would be better outside the EU than within it. After Brexit when the dust settles we mindless leavers will still be looking to our own Government to sort out our own country because that is why some of us voted leave in the first place.

Basically, being part of the EU brings the U.K. massive trading advantages and it means brits can go and live and work anywhere in Europe without restrictive time limits and having to jump through bureaucratic hoops. 

When asked to vote, many people (middle aged/elderly mostly) were influenced by decades of headlines (propaganda) from the right wing press - about bananas and how we literally pour billions into a big black EU hole and get nothing in return. They also thought about how they don’t like French and German people. 

It’s a bit like if an American administration were forced by a disgruntled right wing of its party to have a vote on whether people should pay tax or not. Then, millions vote to abandon taxes. They scrape through by a hair’s breadth and win. Is this a good thing or is it bad? Paying taxes can be frustrating and often seem unfair - but how will your roads get built or your schools and public services operate? Lots of American people and politicians would say “just fine”.

Do you guys *seriously* think the shaft of the penis is some kind of horrible reservoir of dangerous bacteria? Do you think guys piss all on their hands? What is is it about touching your dick with your fingertips that makes you believe it is so terribly unhygeinic?

Yes, health experts recommend people wash their hands multiple times per day. Especially after coming in contact with unsanitary surfaces. *but the penis is not an unsanitary surface*. Especially not early in the day, when you have literally just showered.

Y'all sound like a bunch of prudes, who instantly think anything to do with genitals is yuk and a danger to society. If I go to a men's toilet, I use my foot to open the door, and the urinal automatically flushes after I'm done. I haven't touched a single unsanitary surface the entire time. Why should I wash my hands then? I'll wash them before lunch and before dinner. Or soon after touching anything unsanitary.

There's nothing special about the penis that makes it unsanitary. By your own logic you'd have to wash your hands if you touch your face, or if you itch your belly. Heck, you should wash your hands just because you touched a keyboard or your phone. Both of those are dirtier than my dick.

It doesn't benefit the workforce.

Germany's store closing laws only benefit the owners of small retail stores, because it makes it easier for them to compete with larger stores that could afford to hire people to work around the clock. 

The idea - although this is not really the reality - is that the owner of a small store and his family can reasonably work during the periods where the stores are allowed to be open.

It doesn't benefit all *workers*, and you shouldn't presume to speak for them. Most retail workers are paid hourly, and many might prefer more hours. Or having Tuesday off rather than Sunday off.

5480,"From a previous thread:

&gt; Friendly reminder to everyone in this thread that Neville Chamberlain wasn't an appeaser of Nazi Germany, but an active collaborator at Munich. He even handed over Czechoslovakia's gold reserves that were held in the Bank of England after the invasion! The Soviets had actually offered an anti-fascist pact to the allies in order to contain Germany at the time of the Sudetenland crisis, and even after having been rebuffed there offered to put a million men's worth of divisions on the German-Polish border as late as two weeks to the invasion of Poland, but to no avail.

&gt; The German Abwehr had been feeding intelligence to Britain for years through the Lucy spy ring, and had made overtures to them to spring a conservative coup
against Hitler in cooperation with Britain. Contrary to what most people assume, Chamberlain was the one that held the leverage against Hitler, not the other way round. His selling out of the Czechs represents a spectacular betrayal of a nation that was officially one of their allies.

I really don't get this point of view. Why should a country stay in a union of shared ressources that is no longer benefitting them? Scotland's ressources were used for the UK's good, UK decides to take Scotland out of the EU, UK's political leanings are different from Scotland's, so why stay in this union that no longer makes sense? Had Scotland been independent in the 80s, it would obviously not be in this shitty position.

The threat of independence = the threat of losing Scottish oil. If Scotland is making England poorer, then there is no reason for England to be giving hand-outs to keep them, is there? 

Brexit and Scotland is a false equivalency. UK within the EU was always independent, Scotland is not. Therefore independent Scotland would gain something (control over its own ressources, tax policy,...)  by leaving the UK, UK does not because it already has those things.

5614,"&gt; They were mostly succesful because they outnumbered Europeans

Ottoman army numbers are always exaggerated by wiki vandals and at some point, if we judge by the casualties and male population of Anatolia (4-5 million), there should have been a massive drought in Anatolia because Turks would lose  40% or 70% of their male population fighting jedis with superpowers in mountains each capable of killing at least 25 ottoman soldiers. Also 20% of Anatolia was still nomadic, which means even less food production and complete anarcho-nomadism reigning in Anatolia.

Not to mention the complete collapse of fief system and hence collapse of the Ottoman economy. Since Ottoman economy in those years entirely relied on agriculture and trade (which was the norm back then).

For the Ottomans to have those numbers that wiki battle articles suggest they do, Ottomans either had the population of modern china or they had the best logistics the world has ever seen. Otherwise nobody can explain, using logics, why Ottomans haven't collapsed after losing minimum 50.000 men in every small battle.

I am not making anything up and i'll explain what I said above with my favorite article.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Krujë_(1450)

According to this page more than 100.000 (up to 160.000 even) Ottoman soldiers tried to take Kruje defended by 8000 Albanians in 1450 and Albanians won. However In 1453 according to the source below Ottoman army had 94.000 men 9.000 of whom were navymen, fortress guards and martalos. So that leaves us with 85K men. And I'm sure Ottomans would not bring their entire army to capture some place in mountains, in 1453 they only brought 50.000 men and 10.000 janissaries for example to take İstanbul. And the page mentions only ten guns (Ottomans were a gunpowder empire, artillery was their everything. 10 is too low for their size), yet in 1453, they brought much more because of the army's size (also navy). So at best, we can only guess there were actually 10-20K men there judging from the number of cannon and army numbers below.

For the Ottoman military numbers, check this

It's just astounding how effective the [denazification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification), collective guilt and bullshit/propaganda have  been. 

Post-occupied Germany is still today a US bitch it seems ... thoroughly obsequious to foreign interests. Germans are still today apologising  for invading Poland, which they actually had very good reason to invade in 1939. History has been forgotten and spun into some '*based on a truer story*' Hollywood bullshit version of it.

People are typically ignorant of the fact that Poland had been reinvented, together with Czechoslovakia (which was invented from scratch)  by the '*Allies*'(!), after over a century of non-existence, in 1918, right after WWI and that it was made cut Germany in half ... made to occupy German lands. They also ignore that [rather despicable Polish regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi%C5%82sudski%27s_colonels) that was made to rule over these occupied Germans or the '*Free*""(!!) cityt of Danzig, whch was 100% German-populated but ruled by these despicable Polish regime. Germany actually had *good* reasons to invade Poland in 1939, certainly better reasons to invade than the US had to invade Vietnam, Iraq, Libya, Syria ... etc.etc.etc. 

And then of course, using that excuse, first England and then France attacked Germany, indeed launching WWII.

And today's subservient Germans  '*worry*' and dutifully virtue-signal about the aggressivity and belligerence of ... *their own country*(!!), *Germany*(!?), that they have to watch for.

So which is it? Do women need to be more qualified then men to get hired or not? If they dont, then how is that fair? Now a more qualified man wont get hired, because a less qualified woman takes his place?

1) Taking care of your body - diet, exercise, regular sleep, spending time outdoors in nature. Quite a few studies show that when depressive people sort this aspect out, majority experience significant improvements to the point where they return to normal health. Most depression is due to bad lifestyle. But of course some people have specific predispositions towards mental health issues that might be genetic or due to awful things that happened in life; they are minority but I'm just putting that as a caveat. You need professional help in this case and possibly medicine/drugs.

2) Meaning - social connections, being needed (children, family, friends, volunteering), having a purpose (meaninful job/career, religion, volunteering). In other words, having a reason to get up in the morning and do something. 

3) Peripheral stuff - sunshine hours and other quirky factors like that.

5705,"&gt; I'm not sure I'm the one confusing it.. China is communistic, there's not a hint of a doubt about that... You thinking or saying otherwise despite the world or even their own beliefs isn't going to change that.

That their propaganda is still rooted in the cult of communist figures is true, that doesn't make them communists. Especially in the face of a growing capitalistic market, stronger state, imperialism, nationalism and neocolonialism, all characteristics of a capitalist system.

&gt; And while socialism and communism aren't exactly the same thing.. for some reason I don't think I'm the one confusing them (communism isn't a market system, while a definition of socialism is.. so socialism vs. capitalism, communism vs. democracy) .. Btw, communism can only be done in an authoritarian fashion.. Thus it was never done any other way;

They are wildly different: communism is the dissolution of the State after resolving class tensions, socialism is one of the many ways to get there, in particular through a stronger state, not necessarily authoritarian. Different flavors of socialism have different ideas about this.

&gt; Of course, there's nothing perfect and I even said misreports happen (we've talked about Italy and Romania in regards to suicide)... So it depends on lower levels (which can be cut down to other levels), each with their own transparancy and/or issues.. But not on higher, state level since they would risk for nothing.

If the numbers are wildly off, the cause is not really relevant. You underestimate the impact of systemic interest in faking the numbers compared to just the State be willing to fake the numbers. 

&gt; There is and never was a trully socialist country (while some are close - like Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea) .. There more socialistical inclined, but for the moment everyone is capitalistical. This won't change since socialism works great only in small forms but isn't a viable economical system or at least we don't know a political system that can implement it (democracy can't work);

You're making the false dichotomy between capitalism and socialism, as if there weren't other alternatives. Capitalism is struggling against itself  and against human extiction, not necessarily other productive forms that are now niche ideologies. They have the potential to fill the gaps left by the failures of capitalism and its collapse, but the legitimacy crisis of capitalism nowadays is just an internal dynamic.",,/r/europe/comments/cy4xfy/male_and_female_suicide_rates_in_european/eyq721i/,Chobeat,1567328653

It was actually funny because of the contrast. The perfect vision set up the joke of the worst vision.  This new one is confusing because what was the worst is now labelled, sarcastically, as perfect.

5841,"Adolf Hitler examines the 1930 Gavrilo Princip plaque removed from Sarajevo by German troops and presented to him on his 52nd birthday on April 20, 1941, aboard his special command and control train, Sonderzug Amerika, in Monichkirchen. 

The photograph was taken by Hitler’s personal photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann. Source: Illustrierter Beobachter, No. 18, May 1, 1941, page 542.
The 1930 Gavrilo Princip plaque commemorated the assassination by characterizing the event as ushering in “sloboda” or “freedom”, “freiheit” in German.
The Serbian Cyrillic script on the plaque reads:
“Na ovom istorijskom mjestu Gavrilo Princip Navijesti slobodu na Vidov-Dan 15. [28.] Juna 1914.”
“At this historical place Gavrilo Princip pronounces freedom on Vidov Dan 15th [28th] June 1941.”
The 1930 Gavrilo Princip plaque was given to Adolf Hitler by three Kriegsberichter, or German war correspondents. A photograph of Hitler examining the plaque was taken by Heinrich Hoffman.

 Hitler had established his command and control headquarters for the Balkan campaign against Greece and Yugoslavia in his special personal train, the Sonderzug Amerika, which was stationed at the Austrian town of Monichkirchen. It was in a cabin of this train that he was photographed examining the Gavrilo Princip plaque. Hitler had used the train in the 1939 campaign against Poland but this was the only time when the train was the site of his forward command headquarters. The train would take him into occupied Yugoslavia on April 26 when he arrived in Maribor in Slovenia.

The photograph with the plaque first appeared in the German magazine Illustrierter Beobachter, The Illustrated Observer, No. 18, in the May 1, 1941 issue. In the first published photograph, Hitler’s head is bowed as he examines the plaque.

 A third figure can be seen on the far right. A second, different photograph of the same scene was shot by Hoffmann that shows Hitler standing upright while he gazes at the plaque. There are only two German Army officers in the scene. In a third photograph of the same scene, Hitler is standing with his back to the camera. The third German officer can be seen on the far right in greater detail. He is wearing a German Army uniform with Wehrmacht collar tabs and an Iron Cross. Hoffmann took at least three different photos of the same scene in rapid succession.

The plaque was kept in the Berlin Zeughaus, or German Military Museum, known as the Arsenal from 1941 to 1945. The railroad coach from Compiegne had also been brought to Berlin in 1940 and was publicly exhibited in the Lustgarten across from the museum. The railroad coach was burned by German forces in 1945 and the remains buried. The plaque also disappeared after the war.

The 1930 plaque represented a symbol of anti-German sentiment in the Balkans. It was an insult and a provocative symbol from World War I which was unacceptable in the New Order. It represented triumphalism which memorialized the German defeat in World War I. For this reason, the plaque was one of the first objects targeted by German occupation forces in Sarajevo.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/cy6zee/adolf_hitler_examines_the_1930_gavrilo_princip/eyq2wzu/,lukalux3,1567322129

&gt;The city had neither air defenses nor any apparent military targets.
