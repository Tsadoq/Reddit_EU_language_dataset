4,"TBH only reason I care is because I at some point tried to figure out which European royals are close to me in age, and I found out there are quite alot of royals in my age group.

Alexandra from Luxemburg is \~7 years older than me, Leonor from Spain is \~7 year younger than me, and between those are 1 Belgian and 2 Dutch girls and a bunch of boys (2 Belgian, some Swedish I think?). There some to be more girls than boys, but that may be Willempie's fault.

It seems many royal families are somewhat synchronised, which makes sense since they (historically) married their children to each other, so it is good to have children the same age.

So when I found that the second child from Belgium and Amalia from NL are close in age, I immediately started to think about strategic marriages to forge an alliance with Belgium. üòÇ (I might have played to many strategy games.)",Utrecht (Netherlands) ,/r/europe/comments/k5spq6/why_is_country_country_name_swiss_edition/geh2fsy/,WeabPep,1606990413

26,"&gt; Please explain more. This made me curious. 

Due to the fact that for most of it's history, Israel have existed on the vrage of extinction, we needed to make ideas to flow faster, without the need from higher-ups to have a permit to submit ideas, it was mostly in militery use (which is the reason why most of our home-made weapons had so little testing time, like the merkava mkI had only one year of tests insted of 5-7 years like most other MTBs, and more things) but as we grew stronger and better in our militrey, so did that prosses begun to to spred into civilian life, and it's style was so good, that we are just talking ""right to the point"" it may seem rude, but to us it's the opposite, the more words said before you get to the point, the more you are being looked at.

If you love nature (well, what type of natrue?), go to the galili region if it's green grass and lovely rivers, if you like to see widelife you can go to the negev, for a desert it is booming with wildlife, and even some inhabitted places wildlife can be seen if you're early enough in the morning* (like in Mitzpe Ramon you can find some wildlife in the streets at six in the morning)

(*note, you can also find in Haifa packs wild boars, but they don't have a ""time of day"" in ehich they csn be seen, they are there all the time, afternoon? YES, morning? YES, mid-night?

*Diplomats warn EU negotiators not to give too many concessions to win agreement*

France is poised to veto a post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and EU if Paris is unhappy with the terms of the agreement, according to a leaked diplomatic note.¬†

Bloomberg¬†reports that the internal document reveals how the French ambassador to the EU yesterday ‚Äúwarned chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier of how bad it would look if he brokered a deal only to see it vetoed by EU leaders‚Äù. The veiled threat, at a meeting¬†in Brussels of the bloc‚Äôs 27 ambassadors, piles pressure¬†on the EU negotiating team ‚Äúnot to make further concessions as talks build to a climax‚Äù, says the news site.

French President Emannuel Macron is reportedly ‚Äúleading a group of countries‚Äù who are concerned that Barnier may give up greater access to British fishing waters and back down over a level-playing field for business.

The French position was backed by Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark, while ‚Äúseveral ambassadors pressed to see draft text so that they could have enough time to scrutinise it properly‚Äù.

An EU diplomat told¬†The Times¬†that ‚Äúas we are entering the endgame of Brexit negotiations, some member states are becoming a bit jittery. So this was mostly an exercise to calm nerves in Paris and elsewhere, and to reassure member states that Team Barnier will continue to defend core EU interests.‚Äù

Another source close to the talks told the Daily Mail that avoiding a veto by a bloc of EU member states meant finding ‚Äúa compromise where the UK can say they have won, and the EU can say they haven‚Äôt lost‚Äù.¬†

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg last night tweeted that ‚Äúboxes and boxes of pizza‚Äù¬†were being delivered to the Brexit negotiators, ‚Äúfuelling a late night session ...¬†a sign of things getting seriously close?‚Äù

150,"&gt; 1) It was not apparent during the period of 1941-1944.

It was not apparent only if you didn't pay attention to the **entire** Jewish population of Estonia being exterminated by Germans. It was not apparent only if you didn't pay attention to how German propaganda declared non-Germans to be subhumans fit for only as slaves at best. It was not apparent only if you didn't notice how the German occupants dismantled the provisional Estonian government and made Estonia part of ""Ostland"", opening the door for German settlers and colonists.

3400 Estonians fled to Finland after Germany started drafting Estonians to the army. The Germans established 22 concentration and labor camps in Estonia. Hitler's aims were transparent to everyone who wasn't in deep denial.

&gt;2) It is unlikely Estonians would've been mass-murdered after the war. Rather Germany would've tried to Germanize the population.

Sorry, but Generalplan Ost is clear about what would have happened. Alfred Rosenberg, minister for the Occupied Eastern territories, a Baltic German, born and raised in Tallinn, was the one who came up with the idea of exterminating 50% of Estonians and Germanizing the remainder. After a Nazi victory, Rosenberg intended to create ""Peipusland"" where the surviving half of Germanized Estonians would live.

&gt;but I doubt it would've been a ""send everyone to gas chambers"" sort of extinction.

People said the same when reports of millions of Jews being exterminated were uncovered. You're terribly naive about how the Nazis viewed non-Germans.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/k56sig/on_this_day_79_years_ago_a_small_group_of_german/gegw4o5/,Canal_Volphied,1606983646
151,"You still think it's all about the money eh? You probably think the EU does more good than bad. The tax fraud you imply is not made possible due to our membership of the EU. It is as simple as this: foreign ventures enjoy a tax haven in the Netherlands where they are excempt of taxation from their country of origin. If we alter our taxation laws these companies will just up and leave to the next best thing. And we are in the process of doing so. A return to the EEC European Economic Community. That's the real solution I'm saying. Some, like yourself would consider this getting 'fucked'as you would put it. But what I was stating was: are we getting along? No. A lot of the member states inside of the EU cater only to their constituancy and try to get as much money out of this while they can, and seriously are not interested in building a strong Union. If our neighbours love to do bussines with the Chinese they will find out that there is a very big price to pay. Democracy to the Chinese is just a ploy, a vehicle. Go ask the people in Hong Kong.

But the truth is : The French Revolution values are not to be reduced to the adoption of the Republic. France was not a Republic in 1790, nor in 1798, or in 1803. 

The fundamental values of the Enlightenment and the Revolution were : the abolition of the privileges, the rule of law for all, equality in front of the law. Outside of that, most pre-revolutionary enlightenment thinkers were advocating for a constitutional monarchy.

 Napoleon believed in those fundamental values, but advocated for an authoritarian regime to bring stability. This is why a lot of his contemporaries in France did not see a contradiction between the Empire and the Revolution' values. 

Don't be mistaken tho, the authoritarian turn of the Empire did discard a lot of the new ideas what the Republic built upon the Enlightenment and this part of that Revolution's legacy would take some time to percolate back into our societies, mainly with the influence of communists, socialists and anarchists thinkers.",,/r/europe/comments/k59uj1/on_this_day_216_and_215_years_ago_respectively/gegp9i2/,AlastorZola,1606977479

It's done the most damage to the world than any other country this past century. Domestically the US is also a shithole compared to other developed nations. It's a wealthy nation but the money isn't distributed properly. Instead of using the money to help American people, the money is used to help military and billionaires. No universal healthcare, no mandatory maternity/paternity leave, shitty and expensive education, crumbling infrastructure. It's a country that doesn't help it's people.

447,"In German, this is called ""G√§nsekapelle"" which loosely translates to ""Gooseband"". 

Afaik the history goes back to [herding geese](https://www.medieval.eu/the-medieval-goose/), which used to be quite a big thing due to massive demand for their feathers for quill pens, filling for pillows/bedding, also a high demand for their fat, eggs, and meat for food.

Apparently, they even made pretty [decent guards](https://janeaustensworld.wordpress.com/tag/goose-herding/) due to their territorial and somewhat aggressive behavior.

Leading them around in like that plays into their natural instincts of [following in a line](https://stockdogsavvy.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/large-flock-of-geese.jpg?w=620), also known as the [G√§nsemarsch/goose march](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A4nsemarsch) in German.

That didn't stop the Cold War. There is always room to manoeuvre. China will not stop. It will try and take what it deems its historical right. The more influence that China gains in Asia and Africa the more the US will need to invest to stop its spread. The US will abandon the EU in its problems with Russia. The EU knows this so that is why they are in panic mode and looking at alternatives. Likewise, the EU is not a cohesive body. The cracks are appearing more and more. Between Brexit and Hungary/Poland it is obvious that the EU model is failing. Even now Germany and France cannot agree if they should continue to rely on the US or go it alone.

Maybe it could work, it really depends on the population density of the middle east and north Africa. Ideally the European, Middle east and NorthAfrican side of the union should be well balanced in order for it to work and the countries able to maintain a good level of autonomy, shifting to much power and influence towards Europe wouldn't be good on top of not looking great historically.

561,"Actually, you are describing systems that are not entirely related to the issue I outlined. The SCAF is a fighter replacement program with drones in assistance. The nEEUROn is a demonstrator.

We do not know yet what the SCAF will contain. We do know it will include the NGF, a manned fighter, as well as ""Remote carriers"", unmanned systems tasked with assisting the NGF in its task by providing data, jamming and effectors. It is rumoured there will also be a UCAV. It can either be a combination of a high end UCAV like the S-70 or the nEUROn and ""attritable"" UCAV like the XQ-58 or the newly revealed Russian Grom or it can also be a single system in the middle of the two like the Boeing Loyal Wingman. I'd lean towards the latter as it is cheaper and easier to develop.

Regardless, these are air combat or penetration systems. They are made to enter a contested area, find and destroy enemy air-defence systems or to launch cruise missiles against high value targets.

What I'm talking of is the MALE. In essence, it is a much lower intensity system. Generally, the operate in uncontested airspace (apart from shorter range systems) in a patrol or surveillance mode to find and destroy targets of opportunity (i.e. what they happen to find).

The pinnacle of that is the Reaper but Europe is indeed developing such a system with the EuroMALE. The problem is the EuroMALE is a high end system when it comes to MALE UAVs and I wished we also had smaller stuff like the Turkish TB2 or even the Akƒ±ncƒ± which have an MTOW that's respectively a 16th and a half of the planned MTOW of the EuroMALE.

We can definitely develop it, all the building blocks are there, but we don't... It's the same with air defence. We have systems for everything from cannons to long-range SAMs and some of the best radar manufacturers on the planet with the only thing we really don't have is anti-ballistic system (but TWISTER is supposed to solve that). But again, we don't have the money, political will or I don't know what else, to actually create multi-layered integrated air defence systems...","Belgium, Benelux, EU",/r/europe/comments/k56kto/turkey_azerbaijan_drone_success_should_worry/gefofgu/,loicvanderwiel,1606955381

688,"Sorry to contradict OP, but I‚Äôm very familiar with urban planning in CPH: It‚Äôs a struggle. The car lobby is very powerful in Copenhagen (despite the many bike lanes, yes) and it is the main reason why we are behind our climate target. Don‚Äôt let yourself get fooled, this is a pretty short section of road that was mainly used by buses anyways. The project is also privately funded and initiated by Tivoli, the amusement park in front of it, the second most visited in Europe. The only thing the municipality did was to say OK to the proposal and it took them a couple of years to do it. Tivoli is also trying to fund it by building a high-rise hotel, which they have been trying for years but has been stopped in, given to the proposal‚Äôs architectural disturbance in the old gardens. But now they have figured out that if you want a shit tower built, you just disguise it with this.

This is not a good example of city planning, this is a private prestige project which the municipality ofc will milk for international prestige as well. As if it had anything to do with them.

In the mean time Copenhagen remains one of the most barren cities in Europe (if you disregard the parks, granted) as some old neighbourhoods still look like parking lots. Yes there are a lot of bikes here, but Copenhagen is still very much a hybrid car/bike city, unlike the kind of planning you see in NL",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/k595tu/plans_for_a_new_city_park_in_central_copenhagen/gef8r5b/,rugbroed,1606947897

882,"&gt; It has everything to do with religion and self-respect, not politics even in the UAE It is a big thing.

No it's not. It's all about politics called by Erdogan. You don't know anything about the UAE so don't claim you do please. 

&gt;You're attempt to bring up a French retail store owned by Emiratis and who the vast majority of goods come from domestic suppliers doesn't hold up since buying there isn't the same thing as supporting France.

Carrefour is French. People who called for the boycott specifically called for the boycott of Carrefour, which is owned by an Emirati in all the middle east. 

&gt;This attempt to pretend about things in your country and insult your own people for approval in Europeans eyes is just sad and pitiful.

Did you pull this assessment out of your ass? When did I ""insult my own people""? Also, who cares about Europeans approval. Im stating the facts. *There is no UAE boycott of French products in the UAE*. Clear enough? 

&gt; I don't know how many others you are friends with or how comfortable they are talking politics to you but feel free to go ask around because they definitely back the boycott and don't like France.

I am from an Emirati tribe and I know what my people and tribe members think, and most of them hate Erdogan and Turkey way more than France. It has nothing to do with Islam and everything to do with politics. 

The fact that you said in your previous comment you know Arabic, then proceeded to delete that part after I responded to you in Arabic shows how little you know about the country. So I am not going to bother with explaining things to you. There is no major or non-official boycott of French products in the UAE. There is no major deshelving of French products.

The colloquial meaning of ""long vowel"" and the linguistic meaning of ""long vowel"" is completely different. 

The colloquial meaning is ""vowels that sound the same as their name"".

The linguistic meaning is literally ""a vowel held longer than other vowels"".

 While English has vowels of different lengths, it doesn't change the meaning of a word in the vast majority of accents, so it's not a particularly helpful distinction in most cases. 

Also, iirc, the reason we call the colloquial long vowels ""long vowels"" is because they developed out of *actual* long vowels but then became diphthongs.",,/r/europe/comments/k548t6/six_ways_to_divide_england/geec32x/,MooseFlyer,1606933638

Imagine conducting divorce deal talks about mackerel vs halibut. Why is there no shared conservation/quota administration? After all, fish swim across borders at will.

&gt;But asked if this was the case, MHRA chief executive June Raine said the process was undertaken under the terms of European law, which remains in force until the completion of the Brexit transition at the end of 2020.

There are many subgroups as usual, and three waves - and especially the first wave started to be integrated into Bulgarian society with small factories opening up, etc. With the Bulgarian nationalist assimilation policies, it's sure that many, mainly Christian gypsies, became assimilated; and many in various regions do emphasise the Bulgarian identity rather than the gypsy. Muslim ones are more tricky as they had revived, and some tended to assimilate into Turkish community to a degree. Romanian ones are not assimilated as far as I know, etc. There are some √©tudes on gypsies of Bulgaria, and they do mention various assimilation processes, yet again, as being gypsie was first about the lifestyle, and then abhorred or in the reel socialist period's Bulgarian attitudes something doesn't exist, it's not easy to trace.

A liminal space is a poetic term for a place you just pass through, like a doctor's waiting room or the night-bus, which has no real identity of its own. A liminal moment is a transitionary period between two phases of an event.


So, in war, you have these fits and starts of progress followed by moments of indecision. At Khimki, nobody knew what was going to happen. There would be a lull in the fighting as the balance of initiative shifted towards the Soviets, where both sides had an opportunity to break and the first to blink lost *everything*. 


In 1st El-Alamein the German army almost broke through British lines and inflicted heavy losses, but were stopped. At Alam el-Halfa they attacked again but were stopped and took heavy losses themselves. At 2nd El-Alamein, they were thrown back and the Axis front collapsed. I can only imagine what those few months were like.

but let's go:

Krabakh was 'influenced' largely by Turkey and Russia because they are close to that conflict.
It is completely not necessary or required that any country messes in any conflict on a global level. That would be horrible. Why should Germany have interfered in Karabakh? there was no reason. It is not even close to Germany nor Europe...no its not its neighborhood...look on a globe. In Libya, Germany made a deal with warlords to detain refugees before they make it to Europe, showing our moral bankruptcy...so our government is 'ok' with the state of Libya as a warlord-mess as long as we are able to pay them to play Europe's coast guard. That is the sad truth. 

I follow the U.N. constitution, it is not of any coutries business to interfere in internal matters of a state. Krarbakh was an interstate conflict between two neighbor states, largely influenced by its the local hegemon Turkey supporting one side. 

What was France's role in the Karabakh conflict again? Or the U.S.? they could have done something but they did not. Its all about personal interests. That is also why the U.N. is the only credible conflict settlement body.
-&gt; In Karabakh it was finally Russia. I remember Russia settled it completely diplomatically. We played no role in the conflict because it was not our business or interests.

In Libya, France was involvend in bombing Ghadhafi out of power, so of course they are 'invested' in that conflict. Does it help in Libya in any way? Not in my opinion.",,/r/europe/comments/k4k6fl/europe_must_step_up_on_defense_german_greens/gectwn5/,delta9t,1606904830

1318,"&gt;Yes they are, EU funds depend on the government.

Once again, no. Bucharest doesn't just receive some funds they randomly decide to spend on some parts of the country. It's the parts of that country that have to apply for them and being a highly-centralized country, Bucharest has approve it if it means large infrastructure projects. 

&gt;Hungarian is a recognized native minority language of Romania, is the first language of 1.2 million citizens. Romania was incompetent to inform these citizens, was condemned for it internationally. The experience is a fuel for autonomy motives.

Native language or not, it's irrelevant, these people do not speak the official language of the country they live in. Trianon happened a century ago, they had plenty of time to do it. No country in this world is obliged to provide official information on a nationwide level in a language is not the official language. I told you before, the EU can't talk shit about this, literally none of them do it any differently. 

&gt;Turkish language is not native language of Germany, has a different legal basis.

It's exactly the same legal basis, none of them are official languages. Being ""native"" or not is irrelevant, unless it was some endangered language, we have no obligation to do that. They have the obligation to learn the state's official language, which they didn't. Not to mention that you are being funny, it's only some groups of Szeklers that do not speak Romanian, not all of the 1,2 million. Most of them do speak Romanian, so they had no issue understanding the situation.  

&gt;At the time of the introduction of online classes, education was solely provided in Romanian, hindering children accessing education whose first language is Hungarian.

I've already explained to you that this is wrong. Online classes were organized by each and every school, not by the government. If it was a Hungarian school, the same teachers and the same students would have an online class. Why the hell would they switch to Romanian online? TVR had a nationwide live class offered in Hungarian ever since they introduced these kind of live classes, so again, you're just spewing crap with no basis. 

&gt;despite being native citizens and were promised full equal national rights by the Romanian invaders of their homes, Romania still failed to fully recognize their rights. Romanian people still struggle to get beyond 19th century fundamental nationalist concepts.

Tell me a right an ethnic Romanian has that an ethnic Hungarian doesn't. Just one. They're both Romanian citizens and are treated equally. ""Romanian invaders""? Transylvania had a Romanian majority, do I need to remind you this again? Your people came from Central Asia, if there's anyone who invaded something, it was you. 

&gt;South Tyrol used to be one of the poorest regions of Italy before it gained its autonomy, and has been one of the most prosperous eversince.

That is wrong, South Tyrol was one of the wealthy regions all along and it counted with a lot of financial aid from Austria, a wealthy country. Meanwhile, Szekelyland is just a forested region with a low population, no major urban centers that simply has a poor economy. Hungary is not some rich country either, so they don't get much help from that either. Just like other regions with Hungarians made it to the rich list, like Oradea, I'm sure they can do it too. 

&gt;Minority issues not only involve Szekely people or other minorities, but also Romanians. You as people of the country joined spend your efforts onto minority topics instead of discussing the state of the healthcare system or other important amenities.

That is wrong. I fail to remember the last time minority issues were brought to public light by the Romanian government without any incident to trigger it. 

&gt;by the way this is not facebook, you do not need to capitalize words and sentences.

It's the only way to make you understand how ludicrous any of the shit you say is. It's Romania's fault for not providing information in Hungarian, not the Szekler's for not learning Romanian xD You're just one of them too, not speaking a word for Romanian, so you're part of the problem.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/k46l0q/today_is_the_national_day_of_romania_happy/gecmhux/,Dornanian,1606896953

The echoes of the EU budget and the threat of veto launched by Poland and Hungary continue. In our country, there are already bets on which country will leave the European Union next. Interestingly, neither Poland nor Hungary have the lowest rate.  

Poland and Hungary jointly take the toughest actions against the EU budget. Both countries are threatening to veto the budget as they refuse to link the disbursement of funds to the rule of law. On Thursday, the Sejm adopted a resolution supporting the government in negotiations with the EU.  STS is taking advantage of the political turmoil. 

The bookmaker's offer includes a number of bets related to the European Union and the future of Poland in this union of countries. One of them is: **which country will be the next (after Great Britain) to leave the EU. Bets will expire on December 31, 2024.  Neither Poland nor Hungary take precedence in this case.** 

**The leader in this ranking is ... Italy, whose exchange rate is 4.75.** This means that if someone would bet  100 PLN on the Italians leaving the EU by the end of 2024, they would win  418 PLN.  Poland is second with an odds of 6. The third place was taken by Hungary (odds 6.75). So if we bet 100 PLN on one of these two countries, we can add  528 PLN and  594 PLN, respectively. 

At the other extreme, there are Malta (75) and Luxembourg (75). Putting ""a hundred"" on one of these countries would mean the possibility of winning 6.6 thousand. zlotys.  There is also a bet on which country will leave EU structures faster. 

And so Poland - according to the bookchmakers - will leave the EU later than Italy. Therefore, the odds in such a duel are 1.7 for Italians and 2.01 for Poland.  But if we compare our country with Hungary, then the player will win less if he chooses Poland. The odds for such a duel are 1.8 for Poland and 1.88 for Hungary.  

There were also questions about when the referendum on leaving the EU will be held in Poland and when our country will leave the EU structures. 

 In the case of a referendum - if someone believes that it will take place by June 30, 2021, then for the 100 PLN bet, he can earn 1584 PLN, because the rate for such a date is 18. But the victory will be much less if we think that the vote will take place until June 30, 2023. The price for this date is 8, so when you bet 100 PLN, you can win 704 PLN. 

And when would Poland leave the European Union? The rate for the instant option, ie until December 2021, has been estimated by STS analysts at 25. With a bet of PLN 100, you can win PLN 2,200. The scenario in which Poland would leave the EU by December 2023 has a rate of  12.

100 PLN, therefore, would guarantee PLN 1056.",,/r/europe/comments/k544gb/polexit_you_can_now_bet_at_the_bookmaker_term/gecg8a4/,TyrantfromPoland,1606891345

I never claimed so.

&gt;if you honestly think xi jingping will treat you guys better and not exploit you or do anything you accuse us of doing I'd like to know what your smoking. 

Again, I never claimed so. In fact, I specifically wrote ""Honestly, **I'd rather have neither**, but since this is reality, **I'd prefer a multipolar world**, with the ultra-capitalist oligarchic USA on one side, authoritarian China on the other, and the EU in the middle.""

&gt;In comparison to china the usa treats its allies far better  

Two things. First, that doesn't matter when it's utterly horrible with how it treats non-allies (again, South America, Middle East, Southeast Asia), and second, that argument might work pre-Trump, before America started trade wars with its allies, left **and** cock-blocked the Iran treaty,...

Whether the French are right or wrong is another matter, but it's important to realise that practically no country in the world treats freedom of expression as a near absolute right like the US does.

Even the US has limits on that, such as inciting violence. France had slightly more limits (inciting hate, for example, is also illegal) but it's not like they're absurdly high or that people can't disagree or criticize the government publicly.

1668,"That verse is not 9:5 but 5:33 instead. And you want to make sure to read a whole Sura for context not just a single part of a huge Sura. Here is the context of this for everyone to understand.

28:4

&gt;Verily, Fir'aun (Pharaoh) exalted himself in the land and made its people sects, weakening (oppressing) a group (i.e. Children of Israel) among them, killing their sons, and letting their females live. Verily, he was of the Mufsidun (i.e. those who commit great sins and crimes, oppressors, tyrants, etc.).

So in 28:4 is the description of the oppressor and the oppressed. That is important to understand 5:32, 5:33 and 5:34.

5:32

&gt;Because of that We ordained for the Children of Israel that if anyone killed a person not in retaliation of murder, or (and) to spread mischief in the land - it would be as if he killed all mankind, and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind. And indeed, there came to them Our Messengers with clear proofs, evidences, and signs, even then after that many of them continued to exceed the limits (e.g. by doing oppression unjustly and exceeding beyond the limits set by Allah by committing the major sins) in the land!.

Then the hand cutting part and..

5:34

&gt;Except for those who repent before they fall into your power: in that case, know that Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

Basically there is a penalty given for those who wage war against God and His messenger. Note that waging war against God and His messenger and causing corruption in the land is not to be read as two separate things. The part about seeking corruption clarifies what waging war against God and the messenger is. The part about waging war against God and His messenger is not complete on its own, thus the part about seeking corruption clarifies it. Corruption is an abuse of power for personal gains.

With that being said, the punishment would be to be killed, or crucified, or to have their hands and feet cut on alternate sides, or to be banished from the land. The corrupter is exempt from this punishment if they repent.

&gt;Thirty percent of British Muslims would prefer to live under Sharia (Islamic religious) law than under British law.

&gt;Twenty-eight percent hope for the U.K. one day to become a fundamentalist Islamic state. This comports with last year's Daily Telegraph newspaper survey that found one-third of British Muslims believe that Western society is decadent and immoral and that Muslims should seek to end it.

&gt;Seventy-eight percent support punishment for the people who earlier this year published cartoons featuring the Prophet Mohammed. Sixty-eight percent support the arrest and prosecution of those British people who ""insult Islam."" When asked if free speech should be protected, even if it offends religious groups, 62 percent of British Muslims say No, it should not.

I was pretty young so I didn't pay that much attention to politics, but I think the leak came from his own party (probably someone trying to garner favors with Fidesz) and there was some in fighting so I doubt he cared about the party rep that much. Then he founded a new party because he didn't trust the people in MSZP.

But to be honest his faults and the corruption under him just seems so tame compared to Orb√°n. Corruption seemed like politicians trying to steal money and the party trying to cover for them to avoid public outcry. Under Orb√°n it's completely out in the open, the whole Mesz√°ros empire (or the previous Simicska empire) is built on public money, plus they took over the media, advertising, the propaganda is turned up to 11 with added nationalism and christianity. The whole party operates like a mafia, except there is no need for violence (other than the skinheads turning up sometimes [like stopping a politician from initiating a referendum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAtow6vZ03g), it's still hard to believe that this has happened in a European ""democracy"").",,/r/europe/comments/k4lkz5/j√≥zsef_sz√°jer_fidesz_mep_caught_at_sex_party_in/gebefs0/,HappyPass,1606868136

Really? Maybe during the Communist period, but post-1989 we‚Äôve been one of the most minority-friendly countries in Europe. UDMR/RMDSZ (the main Hungarian political party) has consistently been in coalition governments ever since the late 90s. Native Hungarians enjoy a Hungarian language curriculum, and even enjoy minority aid programmes that ease university requirements. Plenty of Hungarian people have gone on to enjoy positions in high government. The current Prime Minister is half-Hungarian. The current President is an ethnic German.

&gt;	33% are openly against the idea of hearing Hungarian spoken in the streets in 2020

Doubt it. What people are actually opposed to is Hungarians not making the effort to learn Romanian at all, nobody is actually in favour of ethnic Hungarians not speaking Hungarians at all.

1808,"&gt; Yeah, Szeklers lose time on asking for an autonomy that would make them poorer instead of trying to vote for someone who promises something else that is not autonomy.

Actually it has been found by court that Romania was discriminatory based of Hungarian population of towns when redistributing EU funds and the financial story of South Tyrol contradicts your prediction. Besides Romania turned out to be incapable as for informing the public, by declaring the state of emergency due to the coronavirus, Romania suspended to practice the European Convention on Human Rights. Meaning despite 1.2million Hungarian speakers, every official information was exclusively available in Romanian. As for this the European Council has condemned Romania. Furthermore the distance education was also only in Romanian. What speaks more about the relationship of the state and citizen, than an experience of being cut-off from first hand official sources at the beginning of a pandemic of a virus that barely anyone knew much about? They are backed up with fine practical reasons for autonomy.

I wouldn't say a great culture, considering that some of the worst famines and ideologies have come out of that ''great'' culture. I do admit though that Chinese culture has a role in it. But Chinese culture cannot be seen apart from their political system.

It's scheduled in parliament with all parties supporting the revocation. There's no choice there, it was a top court ruling, there's nowhere to appeal.

It's not mandatory to do it with a budgetary law, it could have been tied to any other major decision that Hungary was hurting for.

&gt;There's no proposition without the rule of law clause. It is the decision of Hungary and Poland to veto the budget as it is, nobody else.

My point was, it's all semantics. There could very well be, but why make it when it's pointless since it's clearly going to be vetod.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silphium

&gt;Silphium (also known as silphion, laserwort, or laser) is an unidentified plant that was used in classical antiquity as a seasoning, perfume, aphrodisiac, and medicine.[1][2] It also was used as a contraceptive by ancient Greeks and Romans.[3] It was the essential item of trade from the ancient North African city of Cyrene, and was so critical to the Cyrenian economy that most of their coins bore a picture of the plant. The valuable product was the plant's resin (laser, laserpicium, or lasarpicium). 
&gt;
&gt;Silphium was an important species in classical antiquity, as evidenced by the Egyptians and Knossos Minoans developing a specific glyph to represent the silphium plant.[4] It was used widely by most ancient Mediterranean cultures; the Romans who mentioned the plant in poems or songs, considered it ""worth its weight in denarii"" (silver coins), or even gold.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/k4ky5q/a_longlost_legendary_roman_fruit_tree_has_been/gealgnx/,duisThias,1606853774

&gt;The debt is not going to magically disappear if Scotland went independant.

Multiple layers of cloth with higher thread counts have demonstrated superior performance compared to single layers of cloth with lower thread counts, in some cases filtering nearly **50%** of fine particles less than 1 micron .14,17-29 Some materials (e.g., polypropylene) may enhance filtering effectiveness by generating triboelectric charge (a form of static electricity) that enhances capture of charged particles18,30 while others (e.g., silk) may help repel moist droplets31 and reduce fabric wetting and thus maintain breathability and comfort.

# Aliyev recalled the proposal to Paris to give Marseille to local Armenians

**French parliamentarians who adopted a resolution recognizing Nagorno-Karabakh should instead have proposed to their government to hand over the city of Marseille to the Armenians, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said.**

Western countries do not have the right to urge Baku to give up the territory occupied by its troops to Armenia and discuss the conflict between the two countries, and if France sympathizes with the Armenians, then it should transfer Marseille to the Armenian diaspora living on its territory. This statement was made by the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev in his address to the nation, Azertac reports.

‚ÄúThe French Senate adopts a resolution on recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh. If you like them, then, as I said during the war, give the city of Marseille, change its name, create a second state for them there, ‚ÄùAliyev said. According to him, the very term ""Nagorno-Karabakh conflict"" has remained in the past and can only be used in a historical context.

The French Senate adopted a resolution calling on the government to recognize the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh on November 25. However, the French Foreign Ministry refused to recognize the independence of the self-proclaimed republic. According to Jean-Baptiste Lemoine, secretary of state under the department, France's unilateral recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh would not be useful either to Armenia, or to the people of Karabakh, or to Europe.

For the first time, Aliyev put forward a proposal to transfer the largest port of France and the entire Mediterranean to the Armenians in an interview with the Al-Arabiya TV channel in early October, during the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.

‚ÄúIf France wants self-determination for Nagorno-Karabakh, then let it give them the city of Marseille, almost half of whose inhabitants are Armenians, allow them to proclaim the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and grant independence &lt;...&gt;. What right do they have to demand this from us, ‚ÄùAliyev said....",Kazakhstan,/r/europe/comments/k4qn4r/aliyev_recalled_the_proposal_to_paris_to_give_the/gea6s8p/,Tengri_99,1606846951

You are misinformed. 

&gt; But it is not in the hands of the workers and entrepreneurs, it is in the hands of large corporations that do not use it efficiently at all. What is efficient about these companies having a ton of money set aside? What is efficient about them buying back dividends? 

Why companies would have ""a ton of money set aside""? It doesn't make any sense, not even for the most evil capitalist. When a company has a large amount of cash it's more of a problem because they will need to figure out where to invest this money to get a higher return. ""Money set aside"" is eaten by inflation.  

What is ""buying back dividends""?!?!? You either buy back stocks or you don't distribute dividends. 

&gt; Plus, the idea behind UBI is that because of automation, there will no longer be enough jobs in the end for a portion of the population. That is not today, but might be in the future. 

The automation brought by the industrial revolution created more jobs, it didn't destroy them like intellectuals from that era predicted. In fact, there is a study, I forgot the authors, who calculated the jobs destroyed and jobs created from all major automation advancements since IR and they concluded that the balance is positive. Why this time would be different I don't understand.

&gt; ***And another idea is that if the person has their base necessities met, they can use their talents in a more productive way for society.*** And we no longer need a lot of those inefficient bureaucracies you mention, since those programs have all become unnecessary. No need for all kinds of systems of subsidies or structures for welfare, since it is all just one program that is the same for all. 

Like those guys in Denmark who keep smoking weed all day long? Also, how a person can ""use talents in a more productive way for society"" if the society needs to pay for his/her basic living at first place?? It doesn't make any sense.

State subsidies and welfare should be eliminated or kept at a minimum.

2205,"&gt;I really don't get it how replacing nuclear with gas is a good idea....

That's because it's an inaccurate presentation of facts. Most nuclear plants are certain to be phased out regardless of the government decision, the method is to have companies bid their capacity to get longer term supply contracts. All offers will be considered, with a preference for renewables, gas if necessary, and the last two nuclear plants will be kept to ensure supply if there's no alternative. This bidding will be repeated in time intervals. The result will be a rapidly growing renewable capacity.

There is no mandate to build gas plants per se, though it is likely at least some gas capacity, import or locally, will be contracted given that so many nuclear plants are slanted to shut down in a short time.

&gt;With modern plants the risk of an accident is basically 0. If it were actually dangerous I think France would've blown up several times over already.

The older, the more dangerous. You don't need a full meltdown to create substantial problems, and since the Belgian nuclear plants are very close to population, industrial, and logistical centers, even a relatively small inaccessible zone for even just 10 years would really just cause cascading costs, even if we manage to avoid any victims. Either way, new nuclear is not cost-effective, so the phaseout has to happen sooner or later.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/k4adxu/whos_dependent_on_russias_gas/ge9d035/,silverionmox,1606832062

It was a Hungarian majority that Northern Transylvania had and that solution was still closer to being fair than the previous state. Though interwar European dictatorships do not compare to constitutional monarchies of earlier times. Afterall they are causalities of the others mismanaged peace treaties.

2354,"&gt;You are jumping, from ""we could upgrade"" meaning we dont which is lie, to how much they cost.

Except doing X of something doesn't mean you couldn't do Y more of it so that statement is null. I never suggested there are no bus fleet upgrades happening, yet having an insignificant one in a single city barely makes a difference at this point.  


&gt;until they buy new.

Except this is never going to happen, is it?  
The contractor mentality is just too strong in Greece.  
A whole lot of municipalities still own construction equipment with people getting paid to supposedly operate it in order to fix the roads and whatnot, and yet every single hasty construction ever to take place is outsourced to constructors...  
Not only is that equipment rotting away until it's too expensive to make it operational again, but we're paying exponentially so as for somebody to underpay third party workers, while we're already paying people for this and without anyone even maintaining said projects after they're delivered.

One of the very few mayors to actually step in and get things done the right way was Kostas Meletides (Patras) while building the seaside park and bicycle lane, and the opposition party had the audacity to sue him over this!  
Needless to say the people support him. The park is a gem even though it's still under expansion.  
I should point out I'm not a commie (he's registered with the communist party), but I do support him on this as he honestly did a splendid job on this and other issues.  


&gt;We are not the only country in EU with villages.

We are however population percentage-wise by far the most urbanized one, excluding micro states, with almost half the population living in the capital and its metropolitan area.  
This is exactly what drives the inconsistency mentioned above and why median values mean nothing in this case.  


&gt;I disagree because i value peace to high.

To *high*? What are you even on about?  
Besides, I never suggested we don't upgrade the air force, nor that military strength is evil etc. There is a balance point between military defense spending and politically supported peace and we're clearly not aiming for it.  
That's not to say our region is doing us any favours on this matter, but we still suck at calculations.

We've been spending money on ridiculous projects and that's a fact.  
I mean sure, I'd like a great sidewalk with a bicycle path and fancy decorations no matter the cost, but at the very least make a decent plan for it and don't put it right on the main road.

Germans had absolutely no reason to declare their support for a unification unless they wanted it. Hungarians didn‚Äôt declare it even when it was obvious it would happen, so why would Germans? You only came up with some circumstantial evidence in another language that proves nothing.

&gt; 
&gt; This one which removed the current governement, but besides that accomplished nothing (Tunisia, Algieria)? Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; This one which destroyed economy and the social infrastructure of the country (Libia)? Yes.

Oh, I do agree that Arab Spring's revolutions were not beneficial to the citizens of the affected countries. Except maybe Tunisia, albeit on a extremely small scale that honestly make the violence and hundreds of casualties not worth it.

That being said, the Arab Spring was the first large-scale revolutionary event of the internet-connected world. It showed us that because of the internet and social media, a revolution in one country can embolden citizens of another country in the same cultural sphere to try to have a revolution of their own. That's the interesting fact that I wanted to point out with my initial post, along with the frightening possibility that in such a case, the West's cultural sphere might not only include the West but a big, big chunk of the world.

And I want to make something clear - my post was in no way a call to revolution or civil unrest, or any kind of attempt at idolizing those. I believe that there's much better ways to drive a country's policy towards a better economic and social life for its citizens. And even if we look past the temporary state of violence and the destroyed lives, a ""Western Spring"" might be a catastrophe for the West itself, since its authoritarian rivals would probably gain more from the situation than they might lose.

&gt; What issues exactly in what countries?

In Western countries? Well, there's quite a lot of issues. I'd say that most of them aren't new at all, but globalization and social media makes a lot more people feel concerned by these issues than before. The social structure is changing as well, with inequalities growing stronger in most Western countries - not between the poor and the rich, but between all of those and the super-rich. Populist governments and struggling economies are two other common-ish issues.

&gt; There isn't even one such country.

No, of course, never said there was. But as some pockets of social unrest start popping up (the French protests OP's about, or BLM protests in the US, or anti-lockdown protests in Italy and Germany, or anti-govt protests in V4 countries...), the risk of such a country eventually existing gets higher and higher. It sometimes doesn't take much to turn the former into the latter.

It is important to note that data sets between countries are not directly comparable, due to differences in sampling (most crucially the year of the survey) and definitions (daily, regular (daily plus weekly) or current (daily, weekly or less than weekly) smokers), and that overall prevalence may mask higher smoking levels among particular sub-groups of the population (most notably men in comparison to women). Further, studies which only take into account the smoking of manufactured cigarettes will underestimate tobacco use in countries where tobacco is widely used in other forms, such as in pipes, hand-rolled leaves or as chewing tobacco. This is a key consideration in countries where alternative methods of tobacco use are prevalent, such as in Sweden [27 ](https://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au/chapter-1-prevalence/1-3-prevalence-of-smoking-adults#x27.)¬†and throughout much of Southern and Southeast Asia.

Obviously, these theories are hyperbole, but they are hyperbole based on actual issues that are covered up. Unless you actually start to go after powerful people/organizations that do engage in nefarious activities these theories will have a degree of legitimacy as their basis is true. There are powerful people who use their status to cause harm, including sexual exploitation of the young and are given protection because of their elite standing in society.

2753,"That's a sophisticated response, but I think the foreign-owned portion of Slovakia's GDP is a stronger predictor. Most economies have a ""twin-peak productivity distribution"". Germany's mittelstand is not as common. The UK is a good example of a similar process in slovakia. Its wages are pushed higher by a large fraction of their GDP is finance and other advanced services which employs a small share of employment but drags up the rest of the economy.

By contrast, Slovakia's problem seems to be that a substantial part of profits from their most productive firms are shifted abroad, which gives perennial pressure on the current account balance. Since Slovakia is in the euro, the currency cannot depreciate on its own to fit national goals of rebalancing, so you have to achieve ""internal rebalancing"", i.e. lower wages.

2916,"There's actually a very interesting discussion going on right now in Poland about Catholic Church and how it loses trust and credibility due to their marriage with PiS. During the anti-abortion protests, young people would attack churches and scream at priests - something completely unthinkable before just months before. 

In a opinion poll for Rzeczpospolita (a centrist newspaper) from early November, **only 9%** of young people (aged 18-29) had positive view on the church, 44% were neutral and 47% were negative towards it. In the general population, it was 35%, 31% and 32%, respectively. Also Pew Research Center notes that Poland is the fastest-secularizing country on Earth (measured by difference between faithful share in older vs. younger generations). 

I am really curious to see how many people will be at church after coronavirus. Even before, the Institute of Statistics of Catholic Church did some data manipulations so that the percent of faithful who go every Sunday looks solid: they excluded 18% of population outright from the ""obliged"" group saying these are older people who can no longer attend (I can guarantee you, old people only won't attend if they are really, really ill, and there's no way 18% of all Poles are that ill), recently they also excluded ""emigrants"" based on priests' self-reports (priest would say that he has 2000 Catholics in his parish, but 500 of them are abroad), and the number keeps falling still. 

In many parts of Poland, going to church is a social show; you go because your neighbors go, you go because what would the neighbors say if you didn't? But now this has been broken, as for a few months no one could go to church, and then there were restrictions on how many people can be in. So the people who were going only for show stopped going and I don't really see what would make them go back.",,/r/europe/comments/k44hbl/trust_in_catholic_church_in_poland_201620/ge7h0sb/,szyy,1606781906

2946,"It happens everywhere in the world, specially in multilingual countries. In the case of Catalonia we have a bilingual system which makes all students bilingual in both Catalan (the national language of Catalonia) and Spanish.

Your monolingual system is not preferred by anybody here. Indeed, Catalan-speakers can't choose to study only in Catalan, just like Spanish-speakers can't choose to study only in Spanish. They instead are ""forced"" to learn both. No parent would want their children to learn only 1 language when they can learn 2, which is why our system has been supported for decades by the Catalan population.

&gt; Did it allow that anyone should have the ability to study in Spanish in Spain?

No, it didn't. This was only possible during Franco times. Since then, no law in Spain has tried to make that happen.

&gt; In Bulgaria well over 80% of the population speaks Bulgarian as a native language and the majority of the remainder speak the language even without having to study it at school. This is not even close to being true in Catalonia.

Same happened in Catalonia until the 20th century, when approx 90% of Catalonia's population spoke Catalan as a native language, whereas Spanish was not understood by the majority of Catalans. After the Dictatorship, it changed dramatically.

Thankfully the situation is now improving.

As a side note, I think you don't understand how Spain really works. Spain is not Bulgaria. Spain is a country made of different nations, with their own language different from Castillian (the language of Castille). And this is still today defined by law. So according to the laws approved by Spanish Parliament: Galician is the ""national and preferred language"" in Galicia, same with Basque in Basque Country, Catalan in Catalonia, etc. Those laws give preferential status on Administration and Education to those local languages, instead of Spanish.

For a full-Spanish monolingual education there's plenty of regions in Spain: Madrid, Castile, Andalusia, etc. And outside of Spain: Mexico, Argentina, etc. So, there's no reason to attack the only places on Earth where you can actually study these languages (Galician, Basque and Catalan), and that therefore must be protected.",Catalonia,/r/europe/comments/k3rnj5/language_wars_in_spain_stoked_by_schools_bill/ge7hqt0/,glamona,1606782308

2971,"&gt;Yet it wasn‚Äôt the frugals who linked the disbursement of European funds to rule of law requirements. Credit for that goes to the European Parliament. In July, the frugal countries managed to limit European spending, but failed to condition it on the rule of law. In autumn, member states reworked the July deal into a European draft bill. When this draft arrived in the European Parliament, it contained the usual corruption and fraud clauses ‚Äì but nothing about the rule of law. 

&gt;Furthermore, member states could have used EU funds to give the new European Public Prosecutor more teeth in the fight against corruption. Instead, they gave her a small budget and very little power: she is totally dependent on the goodwill of national courts. Sweden and Denmark are not even engaging with the EU prosecutor. 

Indeed, the frugal four main goal is not protection of European values but unjustified and poorly thought out ""frugalness"".

There are serious challenges ahead for secular society, including how you manage relationships and sex. When a country was built on monogamy and all of a sudden people want to explore multiple relationships and even polygamy, there are knockdown effects that emerge. People need to educate themselves on how other societies are that practice these things, as well as to understand the human being from an evolutionary perspective.

Because greed is in human nature, so it is natural that the elite ( party members etc. ) will get 100x more privileges than an ordinary citizens ( which automatically makes it non-communist ). Soon these party members will make up at least 1% of the population and will become the ""most powerful 1%"", but ""communist"" version of it.

Communism will fail because if you steal people's property they will revolt. When people revolt the state must supress those revolts, which often leads to mass killings and deportations, which angers society even more, until one day everyone's had enough of oppression, enough of lack of freedom and will overthrow the government.  

When you get paid the same as a doctor and as a factory worker, guess what people will choose? People will start to go the easy way in life and soon the state will lack professionals, unless you pay them more, give them more privileges ( again, not very communist ).

USSR, CCP, DPRK etc. all have/had an elite. All of them are oppressing their people and will fall/have fallen. And they aren't/weren't even close to communism.

Any milder form of socialism will work and does work, but it generally requires the government to oppress their people, just so that they stay in power.

3506,"&gt; because have all the same propaganda in PIK and Blitz.

Do we?  I don't read them but I just used the search function in PIK for Muslims and  I didn't get any such  articles in the last year. The recent mentions are because of the French attacks before that you have news like which Muslim  holiday it is today, some mosque opening in Turkey, etc. There are even three articles about  Muslims and Christians in Bulgaria jointly financing a church or paying for some woman's health procedure.  That's not Orban like at all.  I can't get a good feel for the other topics but Blitz does seem  a lot more aggressive though still nowhere  as bad as Hungary's rhetoric.  

More importantly these are tabloids and even if they somewhat do this the major TV stations do not. Also the thing is in Hungary or other strongman countries when the media uses a foreign enemy for distraction this is usually coordinated with the government and they quote the leader to paint him as a  defender. Borisov and GERB are definitely not spilling negative rhetoric about Muslims and gays or the EU that could be quoted around. These tabloids write this on their own accord.

Concern is growing in Brussels about Sofia‚Äôs tolerance of cronyism and corruption


Hristo Ivanov was broadcasting live on Facebook outside a Black Sea villa in July, when three beefy guards pushed him and two other activists into the water. The Bulgarian opposition politician kept on filming when secret service agents threatened to sink the boat that had brought the campaigners to the property known to be used by Ahmet Dogan, one of the country‚Äôs leading power brokers. Thousands watched in real time as the police questioned the group headed by Mr Ivanov.


The video, since viewed by more than 1.2m people, sparked weeks of protests across the country against political cronyism. Opponents of Boyko Borisov‚Äôs government charge that it is a microcosm of Bulgaria‚Äôs problems with corruption and the rule of law, almost 14 years after the country joined the EU.


Mr Borisov‚Äôs political difficulties also raise tough questions for Brussels and other EU countries. Critics say they have failed to put sufficient pressure on Sofia to improve governance. Tensions have risen further in recent weeks because Bulgaria has blocked the opening of talks for North Macedonia to join the EU, raising fears it may join Hungary and Poland in their frequent battles with Brussels and fellow member states.


Bulgaria has received billions of euros from the EU since it joined in 2007. Simeon Djankov, a Bulgarian economist and Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says the money that has flowed to what is still the EU‚Äôs poorest state is part of the problem.


‚ÄúThe EU funds actually increased corruption and state capture,‚Äù said Mr Djankov, who served as finance minister during Mr Borisov‚Äôs first term, from 2009 to 2013. ‚ÄúIn particular, these were used to buy, either directly or through procured projects, much of the media and thus provide a cover for politicians.‚Äù 


When Bulgaria joined the EU along with Romania, both countries were subjected to special governance monitoring. Bucharest initially made strong progress on fighting corruption, but in 2018 it drew strong criticism from Brussels for an assault on judicial independence mounted by the country‚Äôs then ruling Social Democrats. Bulgaria‚Äôs troubles attracted less attention, with some diplomats suggesting that Brussels did not want to criticise both members of the class of 2007 at the same time. 


‚ÄúBulgaria and Romania were for many years kind of given a free pass,‚Äù said Mr Djankov. He added that because of the 2008 financial crisis and the 2015 migration crisis, there ‚Äúhas never really been time for the EU to truly think about accession‚Äù.


A commission spokesperson said that a report last year found that ‚ÄúBulgaria has made sufficient progress to meet its commitments at accession to the EU‚Äù. However, the spokesperson noted, ‚Äúit made equally clear that there is still unfinished business‚Äù. 

But after a change of government in Bucharest in 2019 ‚Äî and amid growing anxiety about authoritarian drift in central and eastern Europe ‚Äî the spotlight has shifted to Sofia. In a recent report on the rule of law in Bulgaria, the European Commission raised concerns about non-transparent ownership of the media, pressure on journalists, and new draft legislation on foreign funding of NGOs. In June, the European Court of Justice found a similar law in Hungary to be incompatible with fundamental EU rights.


The commission also reported that ‚Äúa solid track record of final convictions in high-level corruption cases remains to be established‚Äù. It further noted that a ‚Äúlack of results in the fight against corruption is one of the key aspects raised throughout the summer 2020 protests‚Äù.


Bulgaria has consistently been the EU country with the lowest rating in Transparency International‚Äôs Corruption Perceptions Index, and it has plummeted in the media freedom ratings since joining the EU. Four-fifths of citizens see graft as widespread.

Prosecutors in the Spanish region of Catalonia are reportedly investigating a money laundering case with possible ties to Mr Borisov, who served as a bodyguard to former Communist dictator Todor Zhivkov before entering politics. The Bulgarian premier has denied the allegations against him. Recently, photographs surfaced of Mr Borisov‚Äôs nightstand, showing a pistol on top and wads of ‚Ç¨500 notes totalling an estimated ‚Ç¨1m. Mr Borisov admits owning a gun but says the photographs were manipulated.


Meanwhile, Mr Borisov‚Äôs government is also coming under pressure because of its recent opposition to North Macedonia starting EU accession talks.


‚ÄúThey thought Mr Borisov would steer this process,‚Äù said Vessela Tcherneva, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations‚Äô office in Bulgaria. ‚ÄúThis puts the European project at risk here in an unprecedented way.‚Äù


The Council of Europe‚Äôs Venice Commission also recently raised the alarm about constitutional changes, backed by Mr Borisov‚Äôs Gerb party, which would increase the power of the general prosecutor and shrink that of both the president and the justice minister. Prosecutor-general Ivan Geshev is regarded as a close associate of Mr Borisov. Bulgaria‚Äôs president Rumen Radev has clashed with both men.


Mr Djankov said Brussels is realising the danger posed by Bulgarian corruption too late. ‚ÄúBrussels needs to be convinced that unless something is done now, Bulgaria and Borisov will join the ranks of [Poland‚Äôs Jaroslaw] Kaczynski and [Hungary‚Äôs Viktor] Orban and be a concern,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis realisation has been overdue for many years.‚Äù 


Mr Ivanov of the Black Sea boat escapade told the Financial Times that Mr Borisov has managed to prosper at European level because he has stayed in the conservative mainstream ‚Äî Gerb belongs to the centre-right grouping in the European Parliament. He does not employ the kind of illiberal rhetoric emanating from Budapest and Warsaw. But now, Mr Ivanov said, Bulgaria is coming to be seen as ‚Äúpart of a larger pattern of corruption and populism which is making its way all too well through the veins of European decision-making‚Äù.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/k3t9je/bulgaria_the_eu_funds_actually_increased/ge4xjvj/,proBICEPS,1606731688

3724,"&gt; For Gloria Lago, Spain‚Äôs government and parliament are putting the language of Cervantes and Lorca in peril.

&gt; As the head of Hablamos Espa√±ol (We Speak Spanish), an organisation that wants more freedom to choose Spanish-language education in regions that speak Catalan, Basque and Gallego, Ms Lago views Congress‚Äôs narrow approval last week of an education bill with intense suspicion.

&gt; ‚ÄúThis is an attempt to ensure that Spanish is not a language with a presence throughout the country,‚Äù she said of the Socialist-led government‚Äôs deletion of a reference to Spanish as the language of instruction ‚Äî or lengua vehicular ‚Äî of the nation‚Äôs schools. ‚ÄúIt makes it very difficult to move from one part of the country to another, particularly if you want your children to be taught in Spanish.‚Äù 

&gt; She says Spanish is being eliminated from Catalan schools and is on the retreat in other parts of the country, such as the Basque country and her home region of Galicia, where the native Gallego is close to Portuguese.

&gt; Others depict the controversy as concocted. ‚ÄúWe should be very wary of language differences being used to foster tensions and hatred, when our cultural diversity ‚Äî including minority mother tongues that deserve democratic support ‚Äî is part of our strength,‚Äù said Luis Garc√≠a Montero, a poet who heads the Cervantes Institute, a public body set up in 1991 to promote Spanish language and culture. The government says the real priority is for students in bilingual regions to master both their territory‚Äôs languages.

&gt; But the debate has raged throughout the Spanish establishment. The Real Academia Espa√±ola, the Spanish equivalent of the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise, has expressed its concern, calling for the bill not to ‚Äúput in question the use of Spanish in any territory of the state or to promote obstacles to citizens being educated in their mother tongue‚Äù.

&gt; The centre-right People‚Äôs party argues the legislation represents a ‚Äúbreak with our systems of liberties and constitution‚Äù. On Sunday, demonstrations were mounted in dozens of cities against the measure, which still requires Senate approval.

&gt; The battle has exposed the tensions over education and language in Spanish society. It also highlights the gulf between the minority government ‚Äî which owes its hold on power to Catalan and Basque nationalists ‚Äî and the opposition, which views accommodation with such forces as wholly illegitimate and an insidious threat to the Spanish state.

&gt; The government says the allegations over language are a diversion from the main planks of the bill: an attempt to modernise rote-based teaching and to level the playing field between state institutions and privately run, frequently religious schools that receive public funding and educate a quarter of the nation‚Äôs pupils.

&gt; But when Spanish governments turn their minds to education, intense political conflict is rarely far away.

&gt; With eight education reforms over the past four decades, every switch of power between left and right since the country‚Äôs return to democracy has led to a change in legislation affecting millions of schoolchildren. The government notes that it was only when the last such change was carried out ‚Äî under a centre-right government in 2013 ‚Äî that the existing reference to Spanish as the language of instruction was introduced. 

&gt; According to overlapping figures produced by the national statistics institute, some 90 per cent of the country‚Äôs population speaks Spanish as a mother tongue, 15 per cent Catalan and its dialect Valenciano, 5.5 per cent Gallego and 1.8 per cent the ancient, pre-Romance language of Basque.

&gt; But the ground zero of the conflict is Catalonia, where the Catalan language dominates school teaching.

&gt; Spanish language campaigners say the separatist-ruled region has flouted court orders to use Spanish for at least a quarter of subjects in Catalan schools. They add that the omission of the words ‚Äúlanguage of instruction‚Äù from the new education bill may complicate legal cases to force the Catalan authorities to meet that obligation.

&gt; ‚ÄúIn Catalonia, children generally do an average of two hours a week in primary school, three hours a week in secondary,‚Äù said Ana Losada, head of a campaigning group called the Assembly for Bilingual Schools. ‚ÄúThis is a very irregular situation that the new bill makes worse ‚Äî the country‚Äôs official language, which is spoken by the [region‚Äôs] majority, is not the language of teaching in the schools.‚Äù

&gt; According to figures from the Catalan Statistical Institute, 47 per cent of Catalans identify themselves as Spanish speakers, compared with the 36 per cent who describe themselves at Catalan speakers and 7 per cent who are equally at home with both languages.

&gt; Ms Losada argues that the regional school system‚Äôs longstanding ‚Äúimmersion‚Äù policy of teaching in Catalan is unconstitutional, adding that those who, like her, ask for bilingual Catalan-Spanish education for their children are intimidated.

&gt; The country‚Äôs constitution says that all citizens have the ‚Äúduty to know the [Spanish] language and the right to use it‚Äù, although it adds that other languages are also official within their respective regions.

&gt; Champions of Catalan language education contend that the region‚Äôs immersion system is merely trying to right the balance after the repression of Spain‚Äôs minority languages in past generations, particularly under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, who died in 1975.

&gt; ‚ÄúMany kids come from other environments ‚Äî friends, family and so on ‚Äî where Spanish is much stronger than Catalan,‚Äù said √íscar Escuder, head of the Pro-Language Platform, a group that campaigns for greater use of Catalan. ‚ÄúEven today you are not going to find a pupil of 15 who does not speak Spanish but you are going to find many who don‚Äôt speak Catalan.‚Äù

&gt; Indeed, last year students from Catalonia performed better than the national average in pre-university exams on Spanish language and literature ‚Äî although less well on some other metrics.

&gt; ‚ÄúLanguages with fewer speakers need support to help them thrive in a world where there are three big languages,‚Äù said Mr Garc√≠a Montero of the Cervantes Institute. ‚ÄúBy contrast, Spanish has 489m native speakers, the second most after Mandarin Chinese, so there is no way the language is in danger.‚Äù",,/r/europe/comments/k3rnj5/language_wars_in_spain_stoked_by_schools_bill/ge4qtnj/,kevin_345,1606724503

It was one of many similar massacres carried out by Soviet forces in Lithuania, and other parts of the Soviet Union, during June 1941. Several thousand people were killed in these massacres. The Rainiai massacre was far from the largest of these massacres, but it is one of the best-known, due to the brutality and tortures inflicted on the victims by the perpetrators. Similar atrocities were committed in other places, like the Tartu massacre, in which almost two hundred and fifty people were murdered.*

&gt;*According to the coroner's examination after the exhumation, both the report and the testimonies of witnesses, concurred that the Soviets cut off tongues, ears, genitals, scalps, put genitals into mouths, picked out eyes, pulled off fingernails, made belts of victims' skins to tie their hands, burned them with torches and acid, crushed bones and skulls, all done while the prisoners were still alive.

i hear you on the starter packs being jokes, i used them primarily as a quick litmus test for assessing broader opinions on american culture. 

acknowledging the chart but don't think Hispanic identity is the best marker for other immigrant populations. the article that image is from  goes into depth on that too. 

going back to my original point - i'm saying black culture is distinct from american culture, that distinctness often rubs black folk the wrong way, and modern black culture in the US is comprised of less of the ancestral heritage + culture for most black Americans. i still don't think anything you've said necessarily disproves this, and using your examples in your last paragraph - these are definitely american culture, but they are not *primarily* associated with black (or other POC) Americans. so acknowledging again there's mainstream american culture, but reemphasizing the distinctness of black american culture. 

this is a tough convo to have online given the nuances, so I'll just leave some articles that cover both sides of this for now and dip - thanks for engaging!

3962,"I am a software engineer we have various styles of creating large software architectures. One is called Waterfall where you plan everything out in advanced and assign every group a task, and the other is called Agile where you give a rough outline and then rapidly change based on the costumers demands. Waterfall is now obsolete and no longer used, because it was revealed that agile (a constantly changing development environment that adapted to real world conditions) was superior. China is the Waterfall method, sure from this stand point their plan is great, but this discounts variable change. It may be more straight forward and clear, however it gives itself zero ability to adapt to variable change. Western liberal democratic republics are agile, they may seem less planned out and ill prepared, but they can adapted to changing variables.

Wikipedia article:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsinkable_Sam

&gt;Some authorities question whether Oskar/Sam's biography might be a ""sea story"", because ‚Äì for example ‚Äì there are pictures of two different cats identified as Oskar/Sam. The sinking of *Bismarck* and rescue of a limited number of survivors took place in desperate conditions; British ships were ordered not to stop as there was believed to be a U-boat in the area, and many survivors were left to die of exposure. Pointedly, there is no mention of this incident in Ludovic Kennedy's detailed account of the sinking,[8] suggesting that information later gleaned from sailors regarding the cat's true service were apocryphal.[9]

4003,"To be precise, the law initially forbided the public posting of photos where the faces of officers could be seen. ""Basically"" you would be allowed to film whatever, and you would be even allowed to post it if you blurried the faces. In other words any police misconduct captured on camera wouldn't be censored : it would be only fully shown later in courts if needed.

They are more but the two main problem with this are the following: 
- You wouldn't be able to live film most events (sports events, gathering, national ceremonies, demonstrations etc...) as police are often in frame ; leading to a stomping of the liberty of the press.
- The other one, that is more problematic is that you wouldn't be able to live stream police brutality content : igtv and facebook live have become the tool used to record police brutality as it saves the content on the cloud and not on the physical device. Allowing you to backup the files later if needed. 
 

After the backlash, an amendment was made to fix up the mess by the prime minister and macron. It indeed specified that the crime's sanctions (45K fine + prison) could only be applied to the crime if the footages were posted with ""vile/mischief intent"". 
The problem here is that the later is a vague/subjective matter, and the first one who makes the call on it, is the one you might have filmed commiting a crime. 

Since then, many pros were stated by the law's creator and the party behind it, however very few numbers were brought out to legitimize the claims that this will in fact protect officers, or that police agents are constantly in danger. 

The french police department has been on the spotlight for many structural flaws (the worst being a lack of an independent office for police conduct) and this late law seems like a frail attempt to hide the symptoms (mob justice, violence against the force) without curing the disease (corruption, abuse and impunity for it).",,/r/europe/comments/k3joez/the_lebaneses_love_for_macron_3_months_ago_vs_the/ge3w56q/,Sib_Sib,1606702554

4292,"She was lucky as she was allowed to leave the Soviet Union in 1974.

[Here is something that seems google translated about this and other photos and her life.](https://deborahnormansoprano.com/moda/69581-sovetskaya-manekenschica-galina-milovskaya-biografiya-i-foto.html)

&gt;The magazine did a lot of preparatory work and received unprecedented resolutions on the shooting in the Kremlin Armory and on Red Square. Galina Milovskaya said that the shooting in the treasury took place under the supervision of 17 submachine gunners. She was given the baton of Catherine the Great and the greatest diamond ""Shah"". Under this survey, ""Vogue"" singled out 8 pages of the magazine. Milovskaya did not get a penny for work, the whole fee was sent to the state treasury. The most famous was the photograph, on which Galina is sitting, spreading her legs, against the backdrop of the Kremlin and the mausoleum.

&gt;This shot infuriated officials. Galina was summoned ""on the carpet"" by the minister of light industry, who literally screamed at her in obscene language, accusing her of insulting the most holy - Lenin. ""You would still be naked in Red Square walked,"" he shouted. So, Galina Milovskaya, whose biography depended 100% on officials, lost work in foreign journals. Despite attempts by her boss to write off everything for her ""foolishness,"" she was banned from acting abroad. But this is not the end of the trouble. Her managers from the school somehow got into the show of swimsuits in a strange way, in which Galya took part. They said that she had fallen so morally that she could not claim the title of a Soviet actress - she was expelled from the school.

&gt;...

&gt;She was categorically refused to work, despite the fact that from the West she received very favorable offers. So, the owner of a very large model agency Eileen Ford did a lot to sign a contract with Milovsky, she even made sure that a letter from President Nixon was sent to the USSR. But the Soviet government did not allow Galina to work.

&gt;A. Brusilovsky helped organize the departure, he was able to challenge her to Israel. April 14, 1974, she flies to Rome, where she was already waiting for Eileen Ford. She arranged Galina's participation in the contest of the most highly paid models of the world. Galina was pursued by photographers, they were surprised that she never smiled. She was seriously worried about leaving, thinking about the fate of relatives.

&gt;...

&gt;Galina Milovskaya, whose birth date (1949) is a secret carefully guarded by her, considers her new birthday as the moment of her departure from the USSR, when she was able to change her whole life in an instant.

TL;DR Sovoks were very angry at her and Richard Nixon had to write them a letter telling them to leave this girl alone.",,/r/europe/comments/k38xmu/soviet_fashion_model_galina_milovskaya_moscow/ge37f09/,KomodoMind,1606689019

Now, if you assume that what the propaganda says is true, only insanity or genuine evil can be a reason for opposing the state policy. Since he now believes his own propaganda, he assumes the protestors are irrational to the degree of actual danger to the state &amp; the nation. *They're evil.* Which renders him irrational in real life - as his decisions are rational only in the alternate reality of the propaganda.

btw, starter packs are jokes.  they are funny over simplifications, and nothing that should be used as a guidepost in a serious conversation.

i already agreed that american black culture is a subset of the macro level ""american culture"".  all american sub cultures though, draw primarily from the macro level culture and put their own spin on it.  they also generally are two way streets, giving and taking from each other as the cultures evolve.

american black culture is american culture.  the other examples i gave, grunge and i forget what else, are also american culture. 

i'm also not talking about any single individuals perspective.  i've run into 3rd generation greek guys who said they are greek above american.  those types do exist, but they are the overwhelming minority.  i'm talking about the population as a whole.  here's a survey done for hispanics, and it unfortunately used the framing of""typical american"" vs ""very different from a typical american"" instead of simply american which reduces the numbers that identify with the term:

Killed killed. At least Russian immigrants.

&gt;Why would Soviets need to to be in charge of publish anything in Lithuania? GTFO from our country that's the only thing you had to do after WW2 was over.

I'm sorry, I didn't understand you. Don't you know that dozens of Lithuanian-language magazines were published in the Lithuanian SSR?

&gt;Yeah, same can be said about Red army, bunch of uncivilised, raping, pillaging and murdering bastards. Not my fault they fought for second most evil empire - USSR.

Among the soldiers and officers of the Soviet army, there were criminals. As in the army of any country. If successful, these criminals were caught, tried, and punished according to the severity of the crime.

But in General, the Soviet army is the heroes who destroyed Nazism and saved tens of millions of people. Including Lithuanians. Once again, the Nazis considered 75% of Lithuanians racially inferior.

The USSR, even in the worst case, is only in fourth place, after the Nazis, the Japanese and the bloody British Empire. And then there was the Belgian Congo.

&gt;Okay, get this straight, if any soldier helped Nazis or Soviets, he is not a hero in my books, because Soviets, later Nazis and then again Soviets butchered my countrymen. Two evil empires clashed on our land, sadly for us only one lost, the other won and get to repress us for next half a century.

Never said air superiority is all it would take.Air superiority is what guarantees no major land battles would occur,because no land forces can fight if they are getting light up before opposing land forces even comes to battlefield.So,air superiority would ensure land forces can take all major centers,which means occupation.I also never claimed occupying the land means destroying all rebel groups.There was asymetrical warfare against Nazis in France,does not mean they did not occupy the land.

Armenian problems started with the ottoman-russian wars. Russians provocation of the armenian people of ottoman and ottoman governments incompetency on the subject started the conflict.

ƒ∞f we can explain these things shortly (which is really really hard) .After the harms done by both side to each other, hate started and that led the events of 1915 and that hate lived in to this day. ƒ∞n this case Atat√ºrk's work was just ending it with least casualties while establishing a new modern county.

ƒ∞f we don't want to simplify the genocide we need to look at every aspect of events. While there are so many criminals on this events we can tell main criminals were young turks of the Turkish side and dasnaksutyun and hinchak organization of armenian side.

With all of these events Atat√ºrk is not a criminal but one person who finished the deaths. And left us a place for solution. But did we resolve the problem no because there was a lot of hate and criminalization of one entire nation.

Similar atrocities were committed in other places, like the Tartu massacre, in which almost two hundred and fifty people were murdered.*

*According to the coroner's examination after the exhumation, both the report and the testimonies of witnesses, concurred that the Soviets cut off tongues, ears, genitals, scalps, put genitals into mouths, picked out eyes, pulled off fingernails, made belts of victims' skins to tie their hands, burned them with torches and acid, crushed bones and skulls, all done while the prisoners were still alive.

4622,"I don't understand why you accuse me of not being ""intellectually honest"". It's just simple fact that if countries increase foreign aid, then they need to come up with a way to get that money.

I'm not saying it wouldn't be possible, I'm saying that in the current system we have choices are made. A government sets out a certain budget for things. If one thing increases, it either takes on more debt or cuts other things. And since most rich countries have their own issues (which of course, are of a totally different kind, but to the people living there still real issues they want fixed) the choices of those countries reflect that.

If the money is not going to the right places, how do you suggest we fix that? Do we then install new governments? Do we stop funding completely in that part, or do we allow some corruption since we do want help to arrive somewhat?

You ask me now for solutions, yet you provide none outside of saying there should be more funding. Which is not even a solution in the end. If you were to ask me what could work, is to mostly let these regions work it out themselves.

Unfortunately, any long term solution for the instabilities leading to these refugee streams need to be fixed by the countries involved themselves. The thing we do now is to use these regions for their resources (be it either resource extraction through our corporations, immigration in which we take the best and remove a lot of smart people from those countries to our own, or financial in which we have them buy our weapons and other products). Then we pretend to care by buying off our conscience with some foreign aid funding.

Best thing we can do it cut that funding gradually, remove our activities from their regions and just work with them as equals. Of course that is easier said then done, since other powers would very much jump in to fill that void as we see with Chinese activity in Africa right now for example.",,/r/europe/comments/k380m8/just_a_fact/ge192qm/,cissoniuss,1606659441

4723,"I think it's just not something that Irish people have strong ideological attachments to, the old units. I don't think there really was a major public debate over it, or something that had to be ""sold"" in the first place, it was decided and done. 

The attachment to imperial in the UK probably has both a nostagic ""empire"" connotation which if anything would be decided negative in post-colonial Ireland, plus an anti-European sense that is simply absent in Ireland also, Ireland has consistently been one of the most EU-positive states in the Union, having the [second most positive view of the EU after the Netherlands.](https://www.newstalk.com/news/80-irish-people-vote-stay-eu-poll-finds-852096)

Irish people have tended to be more concerned historically with things that actually matter and less with sentimental attachments to the units used for vegetables- the initial rejection of the Treaty of Nice for example was over concerns for Ireland's policy of neutrality, which historically has had support, at least on some level, as high as [99% of the electorate.](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/poll-shows-a-symbolic-support-for-neutrality-1.92711) But that's something substantive that people actually care about, whether road signs are in miles or km just isn't seen as significant in the same way as the British seem to want to hang on to old units and symbols.

Some of this I think comes from the whole history with the UK and also Ireland's phenomenal economic growth in recent decades which is largely tied to and associated in people's minds with EU membership. And this is also from a cultural perspective to an extent opposed to the history with the UK, it's a moving forward but also moving away from that historical relationship which is overwhelmingly felt to be negative.

4791,"Still, as somebody else said here. You are not really likely of them smashing your head in.

Prison reform is thr next issue, I am an avid supporters of the Loss of Freedom but Not Loss of Living Conditions push.

In prison, you lose your right to the outside world. This right will slowly and gradually be restored, but the effort is make sure you see what life is like with loss in certain social/personal circles. Of course they don't disappear, but they lower then gradually grow back to some point that you leave prison for the weekend, then spend the week inside.

Now on the prison, conditions are not of cuffs and bars. You can freely move throughout the day, you have access to normal amenities, the Internet (of course certain access can be lowered or temporarily removed if you cause issue).

You still have a job, the state can give you a range of jobs to choose, the better behaved you are, the more freeing the jobs. An emphasis on social jobs needs to be made.

You of course are going to need to be undergoing classes to help you with the reason why you are in jail. As such you would have to attend various mental health groups, talk to specialists, overall just set you up to help your issues.

Of course education is important, here you really need to set up a whole system of education for prisoners so after they leave a 6 year sentence, they can get a programming job and whatnot.

Of course this is clearly oversimplified and issues like dangerous inmates will need their own approaches. And how did I get sidetracked to prisons.",,/r/europe/comments/k36ea5/mp_barbara_nowacka_getting_sprayed_in_the_face_by/ge0toay/,IwasMoose,1606652700

&gt;  
&gt;( P. F. Peters, Former Ambassador of Australia to Ankara, 1994) If any genocide or ethnic cleansing has taken place in Cyprus, this has always been carried out by the Greeks. The abortive coup of 1974, organized by EOKA and Greek military junta in Athens, aimed at elimination of the Turkish Cypriots from the Island. Turkey intervened to protect them and prevent Enosis.Since that date, the island has been peaceful and free of bloodshed.

5019,"&gt; the right of the victim to protect his own image. The law actually does explicitly prohibit pictures of someone being cuffed or jailed. So often they will use this to prevent people from filming the arrest ¬´ to protect the dignity of the man being arrested ¬ª. I‚Äôm unclear on the legal basis this has, I think it is bullshit.

On that specific point, they shouldn't legally be able to keep people from filming, but they could go after people actually making available to the public images of the victim that allow to identify him/her, should that victim decide to take legal action.

But as more and more civilians know about the policemen's lack of image protection while on duty, they try to justify taking action by defending their own victims rights.

&amp;nbsp;

That's also the problem with said article of the new law: policemen can (and will) arrest and detain you if they think what you're doing is in clear violation of the law. You can't go supposing someone filming a victim being brutally assaulted by several cops is planning to add even more harm to the victim later on. Meanwhile it would be quite easy to assume that this is being done with the intent of harming the cops, so the cops can just detain anybody filming on the spot, except for clearly identified journalists who know their jobs and would make sure the cops are not identifiable on the final video.

It's important in most major cases, and even in similar information based cases, such as slander. If you can prove your intention in spreading the information was for a good reason, and you believed the info to be true, you can be found innocent of slander

If we go by the slander, it actually kind of makes sense to include intent to some degree in a law like this. If someone posts a photo of a cop with a call to action against the cop that's negative they could be found guilty, however if it was posted with the intention of beginning an inquiry, the poster is innocent

And people who say ""I drink once every 40 years"" (this is an expression in Turkish, essentially you use it when you say you do something rarely, it's not literally 40 years of course) is 4,784 million people which is %9,2 of the 18+ population. 

There are also 4,4 million people (%8,4) who used to drink but not anymore and the remaining 35,6 million (%68,5) never consumed alcohol. 

%9 of people who say they are devoutly religious drink, %11 of religious people drink, %41 of people who say they have ""faith"" drink, %65 of irreligious people drink. 

&gt;Also what‚Äôs common in Turkey to drink?

In terms of mainstream beverages/consumption, not different from other countries except for [rakƒ±](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakƒ±). Beer still is the king, a Euromonitor report from 2012 says beer consumption is 10x that of wine consumption and twice of rakƒ± and others. Since rakƒ± has a lot more alcohol by volume compared to beer, beer only being consumed twice more should tell you how much rakƒ± is consumed. There are lots of people who only drink rakƒ± and not any other alcoholic beverage, especially amongst older people. 

I got all that from 3 studies, could link them if you are interested but they are all in Turkish so I don't know if they would have any utility to you.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/k2o5c3/map_of_countries_by_tea_consumption_per_capita/gdz8qdw/,lavta,1606625720

Brexit isn't and never had been about ""freedom"", it's a major victory for the Russians and other former Soviets who never stopped fighting the Cold War. Conservative morons bought their psyops campaign hook, line, and sinker. The only thing that Brexit does is weaken the UK and the West overall. 

Brits no longer have free travel to and from EU countries (exception being on the island of Ireland, which is relates to the agreement as it is the Bloc enforcing a treaty between the UK and one of their member states). Brits now have substantially less leverage in international trade. Brits no longer have external support for the NHS, which conservatives have been pushing to break and privatize so that the wealthy can extract wealth from the populace off of systems built with taxpayers' funding. Labor laws are no longer likely to be as strong as there is no longer as large of a collective bargaining unit.

There is, objectively, no benefit to any citizen in the UK, except for the extremely wealthy, and there is substantial detriment. London is not going to recover from the pandemic, economically, as companies that were looking at options before Big 'Rona are just going to leverage the shutdowns as a pivot point to move operations to somewhere that is a gateway to the EU marketplace, generally Dublin, but possibly Amsterdam or Brussels.

The Ottomans who we‚Äôre occupier go Greece at the time granted appropriate documentation and allowed purchase. Would this happen today? Absolutely not. But does it invalidate Elgin‚Äôs ownership and bequeathment to the British Museum? Your position is that this is an ethical and moral position where the BM should return these objects to Greece due to the imperialist roots of ownership. But they were obtained legally, Elgin brought them to the UK (recovered them when his ship sank and went broke) to preserve them. Now, you can call him a filthy imperialist if you like, but he was try8ng to save the items, and if you see the damage done to the remainder from subsequent fighting in the area, thank god!

5243,"Your comments are showing that it is you that is emotionally tied to this,not me.

I am neither Portuguese nor Spanish,this is simply a phenomenon to me.

"" That's where you are wrong. War, specially in our times, is a highly unpredictable and dangerous affair, for all parts involved. Just ask Israel how they survived.""

By having bigger military budget and more modern,better weapons then their foes,as I have previously said.

And no,war is not unpredictable affair in this 1 on 1 context.

Every analyst worth their salt could have predicted who is going to win in Nagorno Karabakh conflict based purely on military budgets and equipment.

"" It's not in number of missiles or dollars, but in the will of a cohesive, 900+ year old culture and a history of passive-aggressive resistance that makes any occupation attempt extremely hostile for invaders. ""

Again,sorry to burst this bubble,but this is mythology.Every country in the world can claim this and point to specific times in history.

"" Plus, the Portuguese understand the Spanish specially well, we know what makes them tick and are obviously in good terms with them, as while different, they are our Iberian brothers and we know most wars in the past were the responsability of the Monarchies, not the peoples of both countries.""

Never my point.My point is that Spain could have conquered Portugal if they wanted it in modern era.

"" But would they have the manpower to hold on to a country full of people that own guns (many surplus from the 60/70s wars in Africa, hundreds of thousands of reservists, a military doctrine that is all about asymetrical warfare and that would undoubtely be paid both in money and in blood?""

Yes,easily.Owning guns is not really a factor in modern military doctrines and romanticism about asymetrical warfare is just that,romanticism,amplified by popular culture.We all saw this asymetrical warfare in Nagorno Karabakh.It does not work against drones and air power.

"" You see, there's much more to war than just destroying some bases and achieving air superiority. Otherwise, the entire might of the US military + NATO wouldn't have needed to spend nearly 20 years in Iraq and Afghanistan.""

NATO and USA are not fighting a war though in those areas.They are fighting terrorism which is the weapon of desperate people.When you are desperate,you go to terrorism(killing civilians,suicide bombers).

When you are less desperate,you try with asymetrical warfare( harassing supply routes or assassinations of high military targets) and only when you are strong enough you go for conventional warfare.Nobody likes to fight asymetrical warfare.

"" The Portuguese often remember, in jest, the alleged words of Julius Cesar...""

You will find that most countries have this alleged words of Julius Cesar or Napoleon or some other historical figure praising their own country.

It is mostly inflated and invented for national pride.

At the end,my point was about modern era and not about the past.

If a country in modern era decides to conquer another,without bigger involvement from other sides,the side with better weapons and better military budget is going to win 10/10.

My additional point is that no people are special or uniquely tough.",,/r/europe/comments/k2jdtv/google_why_country_in_russian/gdysarm/,hemijaimatematika1,1606616851

5276,"Ok let‚Äôs put this another way. Everybody (France, U.K., Spain, etc) has adapted their fishing industry to having a part share of a wide area, and selling to a wide market. Cutting off either side‚Äôs fishermen from the other side‚Äôs waters damages them in ways that‚Äôs hard to sustain: for example if British fishermen can only fish British waters they‚Äôll have exclusive rights to a few certain fish stocks but because fish have delicate life cycles and migratory patterns and the fishermen can‚Äôt move on to other stocks by season, their jobs will become monoseasonal in ways their cash flow can‚Äôt sustain. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you get exclusive rights to herring grounds if herring can‚Äôt be caught there at certain times of year. Fishermen can‚Äôt make five times their usual catch in (say) October and then just keep selling those caught fish for the next several months. Caught fish expire quickly. The British fishing industry could adapt to the change but it can‚Äôt absorb the shock of the changes all at once; cash flow is the problem. The U.K. government could help them with that via subsidy but the U.K. government is gonna be busy putting out a dozen other economic fires as no-deal will be taking effect in every industry all at once. It‚Äôs the same calculus as the logic behind ‚Äúflattening the curve‚Äù for COVID.

It also damages French fishermen the same way, but because the EU is bigger it will be better able to subsidise by distributing the burden; this is why you may have read headlines about France wanting a share of the EU‚Äôs Brexit compensation fund. France won‚Äôt get everything it wants (the fund is not intended to completely compensate all losses but merely to help national industries survive the transition by absorbing the initial impact) but it will get a share.",Munster (Ireland),/r/europe/comments/k2ma6r/a_sea_apart_uk_dismisses_eu_brexit_deal_fishing/gdytise/,ibFlare,1606617392

The US administration adopted in the 2000s the position that this number might be used to get older NATO members to increase their spending again, which was reduced after the end of the cold war. At this point it was just a political tool to built up soft pressure.

After the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Obama was able to get the other NATO countries to agree to 'move towards' 2% by 2024. But only with an non-binding declaration and not on the basis of an actual contract or treaty.

5455,"The Classical Parthenon is clearly culturally significant to all of western civilisation, especially as a symbol. This is why the Greek state has made such efforts to demolish the minaret and mosque, surrounding medieval buildings etc. And why the state rebuilds the Parthenon now, even though it's ruined state is part of its story and history.

The people who built the Parthenon (the rulers of the Colonial Athenian Empire) are gone. The early Christians who turned the Parthenon into a church are gone. The Venetians who damaged the Parthenon in war are gone. The Ottomans who governed Athens when the marbles were possibly sold are gone. Elgin is gone, but the liberal belief in the importance of ancient Greece as the birthplace of Europe survives.
I'm not trying to discount history and identity entirely. Restitution is very important in cases where there is a defined rightful owner. In the case of the marbles I don't think it's at all clear who that should be.

What important is where the sculptures can contribute the most now. Greece's case should be building the arguement that they can be just as educational in Greece, be seen and studied by just as many people's and be understood better in their original context. The acropolis museum providing a safe housing for the artifacts is an important step towards this.

* Economic: St. Petersburg -- the capital at the time -- was starving, as well as whole country was in deplorable state. There were no money for the war.
* Morale: nobody wanted this war from the start. Nobody wanted to continue it.
* Army and its subordination: the eastern front was held by *the Imperial Army*, but the Empire had already fell by the time.
* Domestic problems: Lenin and co had to deal with the surviving internal enemies and so they did only by 1922.

5548,"It's a bit dependent on the definition of the borders of Europe. Theoretically, the South-Eastern limit of Europe goes like this: Black Sea, Caucasus, Caspian Sea and Ural River.

But the Caucasus is not a straight line like the Ural River is. It is a whole region? The Caucasus is divided into 2 main ranges: the Greater one to the North where the Elbrus lies and the Lesser one to the South, in which one finds Armenia and that is also partly located in Azerbaidjan. In between, one finds the Transcaucasia that includes Armenia, Azerbaidjan and Georgia. Finally, North of the Greater Caucasus lies Ciscaucasia. Together they form the Caucasus region.

There are multiple definitions:

1. Europe stops where the Caucasus starts, thus at the Northern border of Ciscaucasia. Under this definition, Europe would stop around the border of Krasnodar Krai, Stavropol Kari and the Republic of Dagestan.
2. Europe stops at the Greater Caucasus. This is the most commonly accepted definition because the Greater Caucasus, a bit like the Pyrenean can be seen as a straight line making a perfect natural barrier. 
3. Various definition in Transcaucasus and the Lesser Caucasus
4. Europe stops at the Southern end of the Lesser Caucasus or at the southern borders of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaidjan with Turkey and Iran. This is the most extreme definition (although an additional one also includes the Armenian Highlands, presently in Turkey).

Under definition 1, the Mont Blanc is the highest peak in Europe. Under definitions 3 and 4, it's the Elbrus. Under definition 2, it still depends on the specific. Is Europe defined as including its borders or excluding them? In the first case, the Elbrus is in Europe. In the second, Europe stops at its feet and the highest peak is the Mont Blanc.","Belgium, Benelux, EU",/r/europe/comments/k2tmoy/elbrus_russia/gdx22vu/,loicvanderwiel,1606594906

I was just stating that your argument that less... stable countries like Egypt, Indonesia and Syria inherently know how to protect artifacts because some items *happened* to survive the ages is fundamentally flawed.

Most of the time, especially with Egypt (the Sphinx was literally buried under sand before it was rediscovered), items only survived due to a combination of chance and obscurity. Hell, Egyptian tombs are literally still getting vandalised by tourists in the modern age, due to a lack of security.

5592,"Okay but you said that under a post about Greece and the UK without specifying that you weren‚Äôt talking about the image but only about war zones. You presented it as a blanket statement and I responded to it the way I did because that blanket statement doesn‚Äôt apply so often to so many items that aren‚Äôt being returned. Most people who assume the pieces are safer in foreign museums do so because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been told over and over again - not because it‚Äôs true - because in many instances (like the one this post is about) it‚Äôs not true at all.


While I see your point in a lot of what you wrote I still disagree with your original statement. New liberalism isn‚Äôt more divisive that ~anything~ racism related in the past. 

Considering how being called a racist made you feel, how do you think it was/is for the generations of people who are called slurs because of things they can‚Äôt change about themselves. Considering the alleged economic disadvantage that open borders present to some - consider what its like to be intentionally economically suppressed in a way that has ramifications today. The division in the past was a far worse experience than what we‚Äôre experiencing today for those that were on the losing side of the equation. What‚Äôs changed is that any attempt to build a new normal is going to force us to deal with past issues - but collectively and historically we‚Äôre not very good at smooth, considerate social improvements. Every major step forward in the past was painful and imperfect. But over time the helpful bits stick around and the unhelpful bits subside (admittedly they rarely completely disappear).


I said you were projecting because you specifically accused me of persecuting Brits when I never ever did. If others have when you had similar convos - then that sucks and I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you - but it‚Äôs not what I‚Äôve done at any point. I‚Äôve given you multiple examples and explanations on why (imo) and how post-colonial attitudes tie into the topic of repatriating museum pieces. And again, your original statement (under a picture of Greece and the UK) did not seem to be anything other than the old propaganda yet again. If you don‚Äôt understand why I saw it that way please feel free to scroll down this thread or look up others on this topic - inevitably ppl will always say ‚Äúbut it isn‚Äôt safe to send them back‚Äù even when it is in that particular instance.",,/r/europe/comments/k2l2lc/the_lonely_sister_london_british_museum/gdx35k7/,Kapaloo,1606595265

5628,"of course it wouldn't be ""as cool"" as the original. you know what's also not cool? the fact that the places of origin for these artefacts have no control over the artefacts themselves while other countries continue to profit off these artefacts for literal centuries

it seems that we're faced with two uncool options and the relatively cooler alternative would be to return it to its place of origin and have the replicas serve as, in my opinion, an excellent compromise between these two uncool options. it still gives people a chance to see stuff that is foreign to their country as opposed to not seeing them at all.at the same time, it restores ownership of these artefacts to their places of origin

and your comparison between replicas and holograms is not valid because a hologram is not even close to being a perfect representation of the actual thing while a good replica would be 99.9% identical to the genuine artefact and the only thing distinguishing between the two would simply be the knowledge that one is genuine and the other is not. yes, the sense of awe might be missing but that's a worthy trade-off when you realise that the artefact that inspired this sense of awe has simply moved places rather than cease to exist",,/r/europe/comments/k2l2lc/the_lonely_sister_london_british_museum/gdwglqs/,housebottle,1606587498

Let's say the future becomes a vegetarian or artificial meat type of future, they themselves will look back at us and even ask themselves ""how could they do that to those poor animals"". Even now there are those who are against the food industry and the slaughter of animals for meat consumption but the general consensus is that eating animals is normal now and not something that the general population is upset about.

And I'm sure even in the future there will be someone like you trying to make your point and someone like me trying to make my point but that just doesn't change the fact that as times change so do our overall general morals and values. 

As for the slaves thing, yes there were those who saw everyone as equal and slavery as a very bad thing to do but a larger portion of the population believed in profit and seeing someone as less than equal or 1/3 as equal is easier. (This is obviously before the anti slave movement began to really pick up speed)

Very long response I'm sorry about that but basically I'm trying to say that it is utterly blind to say that there is a population of people who saw certain things done through history as bad but that doesn't change the fact that the general population probably didn't care and us being there at that time would more than likely have the same effect.",,/r/europe/comments/k2l2lc/the_lonely_sister_london_british_museum/gdwgsnp/,SelfProclaimedMeme,1606587561

Delusional. Utterly delusional. Also confirmation bias to the extreme.

Look kid, you're 16. You're very susceptible to jump on any popular political narrative your peer group endorse. You're also being played like a fiddle by political actors far older and wiser than yourself. 

When you grow up you'll realise one the reasons why Britain has been so successful historically is because of a good culture of democracy and a lack of reverence for haughty ideals and supposedly ideologically ""pure"" rhetoric. It is easily in the top 10 countries globally for being at the forefront of progressive ideology. Most of Europe is a folkloric conservative backwater by comparison.

You also live in a highly nationalist, and corrupt culture that sings its own praises endlessly. I have worked for companies that literally have to write off bribes to Greek authorities as expenses and it's just considered the cost of doing business in your country. The fact that you seem to think you live in a progressive paradise while acknowledging that 80% of your population are religious and 80% are rural is testament to your lack of knowledge. 

The British people you hear talking negatively about our government and society is testament to the fact that our system is working. Meanwhile, most countries just talk themselves up out of a sense of national inferiority and old-fashioned patriotism.

5767,"That's an old misconception, made popular on internet by [an atheist made up graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/AtheistMyths/comments/jri6r8/an_old_classic_the_dark_ages_caused_by/), a misconception which carries on, even after the historians community has discarted it as not historical.  
&gt;The concept of a [""Dark Age""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages_(historiography\)) originated in the 1330s with the Italian scholar Petrarch, who regarded the post-Roman centuries as ""dark"" compared to the ""light"" of classical antiquity.  
The phrase ""Dark Age"" itself derives from the Latin saeculum obscurum, originally applied by Caesar Baronius in 1602 to a tumultuous period in the 10th and 11th centuries.  
The concept thus came to characterize the entire Middle Ages as a time of intellectual darkness in Europe between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance; this became especially popular during the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment.  
&gt;  
&gt;As the accomplishments of the era came to be better understood in the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars began restricting the ""Dark Ages"" appellation to the Early Middle Ages (c. 5th‚Äì10th century), and now scholars also reject its usage in this period. **The majority of modern scholars avoid the term altogether due to its negative connotations, finding it misleading and inaccurate.** Petrarch's pejorative meaning remains in use, typically in popular culture which often mischaracterises the Middle Ages as a time of violence and backwardness.  
&gt;  
&gt;### Modern academic use  
&gt;The term was widely used by 19th-century historians.  
&gt;Most modern historians do not use the term ""dark ages"", preferring terms such as Early Middle Ages. But when used by some historians today, the term ""Dark Ages"" is meant to describe the economic, political, and cultural problems of the era. For others, the term Dark Ages is intended to be neutral, expressing the idea that the events of the period seem 'dark' to us because of the paucity of the historical record. The term is used in this sense (often in the singular) to reference the Bronze Age collapse and the subsequent Greek Dark Ages, the brief Parthian Dark Age (1st century BC), the dark ages of Cambodia (c. 1450‚Äì1863 AD), and also a hypothetical Digital Dark Age which would ensue if the electronic documents produced in the current period were to become unreadable at some point in the future.
&gt;  
&gt;However, from the later 20th century onward, other historians became critical even of this nonjudgmental use of the term, for two main reasons.  
Firstly, it is questionable whether it is ever possible to use the term in a neutral way: scholars may intend this, but ordinary readers may not understand it so.  
Secondly, 20th-century scholarship had increased understanding of the history and culture of the period, to such an extent that it is no longer really 'dark' to us.  
To avoid the value judgment implied by the expression, many historians now avoid it altogether.",,/r/europe/comments/k2nm48/scale_model_of_imperial_rome_at_the_museum_of/gdvxb7s/,zeando,1606580370

5770,"I don't agree with you at all that it's unique. We are more at risk of it happening than ever with the likes of Brexit and Trumpism.

I don't think it's satisfactory because I don't believe that you believe it. I don't believe that you actually think there is a reason for the British to formally apologise for anything

I don't see how interpreting Priti Patal saying starving Ireland is a reason for the EU to back down with Brexit negotiations can be taken any way other than that she's a fucking awful human. Also I've given examples of actual british people being awful in this day and age, that's not me interpreting things in the worst possible way, that's me observing the fact that there is no remorse from the british side that since 2016 they have been incredibly destructive and harmful to other nations for the sake of ""sovereignty"" which can't be regained unless they go back to the state of imperialism.

No what it says to me is that you have no empathy for the people who underwent struggles or that the British should behave with a little bit of decorum instead of hiding in fridges.

Ah yes the moral superiority of ""stop being mean to us (the British) we don't deserve it, we only engineered a few famines that killed millions of people""

&gt;Because you were the one blasting that Germany was a racist shithole while closing your eyes in the real, proven and documented racism towards Asians taking place in the US.  
&gt;  
&gt;Each time you answer you go deeper in absurdity and stupidity.

 In a previous comment that you made to another person, you stated ""Racism and racial tensions exist in Europe but are nowhere near as bad as in the USA. Read that: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_incidents\_of\_xenophobia\_and\_racism\_related\_to\_the\_COVID-19\_pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_incidents_of_xenophobia_and_racism_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic)""

You were already making that conclusion even though you didn't have hard data to compare between europe and USA. So you are actually the one who originally stated an opinion, not a fact, and you had proved yourself to be stupid and absurd from the get-go. 

\&gt; You seem to have a very poor understanding of how a search engine works. This type of argument of yours is why you ca't be taken seriously. You didn't even bother reading the Google search results for [https://www.google.com/search?q=racism+asians+coronavirus+USA](https://www.google.com/search?q=racism+asians+coronavirus+USA) because it demonstrates you're wrong. 

If you google  [https://www.google.com/search?q=racism+asians+coronavirus+germany](https://www.google.com/search?q=racism+asians+coronavirus+germany), you will find articles detailing the real, proven and documented racism against Asians in germany.
