At any point in what should be a reasonable conversation between 2 adults, either one can simply reply with   ""eat shit and die"" and that's the end. It gets far worse than that but that's hardly my point. Most people wouldn't say that to a real, live person, but it's becoming more common IRL because people are getting used to it being ok to tell someone to ESAD online. There's this desensitization of people looking at their fellow man and instead of  thinking of them as husband/wife/father/mother/brother/sister/friend they think if them as the disembodied voice of militant, attacking, disagreement. Sort of an extension of road rage where people feel invulnerable in their shiny metal cocoon.

I spent a lot of time on BBSs and later web forums. The tone has changed. Sure there was always somebody ready to knock your dick in the dirt for being wrong, but you could discuss relative merits. People would acknowledge when you made them think about things. That seems to be largely lost.

97,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Germany#Post-War_Reconstruction

&gt;During the Allied strategic bombing campaign of World War II, the historic city centres of most cities suffered severe losses to architectural heritage, with significant cases of almost total annihilation.
&gt;
&gt; The fiercely discussed reconstruction efforts after the war varied considerably between East and West Germany, and between individual cities. In most cities some of the more significant landmarks were restored or reconstructed, often in a simplified manner. In general, the cities were not reconstructed according to their historic appearance, but in a functional, modernist style, with often a greater emphasis on desperatetly needed housing, than historic structures.

Post-war Germany had finite resources.  So, you have a couple of options:

* Construct buildings without slapping a lot of exterior ornamentation on them, but have fewer buildings,  Maybe some people don't get housing as soon.

* Put up simpler buildings, but get people under a roof.

My suspicion is that Germany made the right call.  Regardless of one's aesthetic preferences, I'd think that ""roof over someone's head"" probably comes first.

Also,, I suspect that most of the ornamentation is something that could be added on and maintained after initial construction if one wants.  I mean, those arches on some of the building windows aren't intrinsic to the build's structure.  I suppose that they're mimicking arches that were functional in stonework to bear load, but you could stick 'em on the exterior if you want.

My suspicion is that most people don't actually want to pay what it would cost to have woodwork (well, or some sort of fire-safe equivalent) added to the exterior of their building and maintained.  I mean, there's nothing stopping a building owner from adding that stuff to the outside if they think that Germans are willing to pay for it and prefer it, but they don't seem to do so.

I guess that you could argue that there's a positive externality here, that maybe Germans as a whole derive benefit from buildings around them looking decorative above and beyond the building that they live in being decorative.  I suppose that they could vote for an tax subsidy for architecture, but as far as I know, that hasn't happened and is not common around the world.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8gto0v/post_war_architecture_in_germany_in_one_picture/dyfcnsd/,vokegaf,1525413993

Vietnam:  Wholesale disaster.  We lost.

1st Gulf War:  Victory

Bosnia NATO action:  won (European allies requested our involvement.)

Kosovo NATO action: won (European allies requested our involvement)

Afganistan:  Total mess that is still ongoing but you can't exactly say we lost.  The Military does quite well fighting but if winning is defined as achieving our political goals then we're losing or perhaps ceasing to care.  Also, complete mess and a tragic waste of time.  Never should have gone in.

Iraq War:  Won the initial war but suffered greatly from insurgents during occupation.   Made the place worse off and created a power vacuum during the pullout that was filled by ISIS in both Iraq and then over the border into Syria.  Total fools errand and probably the worst policy blunder the US has made in a century, at best since Vietnam.  Also this war was sold to the American people by lies and was a criminal action.

Libya:  won war, but created complete clusterfuck with no political objectives met.  Also, this intervention was championed by Camerion (UK) and Sarko (France).  Obama ultimately agreed to their requests for action after getting assurances that France and the UK would do the heavy lifting but we ultimately got left holding the bag.

105,"Neil Gaiman's *Norse Mythology* is one of the worst treatments of Germanic/Nordic mythology I've read (ignoring comic books).  It was childish, boring, and lacked any semblance of the grandeur of the characters, stories, or mythology.

It was enormously disappointing, especially after growing up on Kevin Crossley-Holland's excellent treatment of them in *Norse Myths*, to say nothing of reading lots of other treatments and analyses, such as Georges Dumezil's more academic *Gods of the Ancient Norsemen*.

There is a pretty large body of work, academic and otherwise, analyzing the Norse and Germanic myths, as well as trying to link them with the spread of Indo-European languages.  There are a lot of parallels with Germanic deities and the core Hindu deities.  It's widely accepted that both sets of mythology stem from the same foundation and spread along with the languages.

Legendary science ficiton and fantasy author, daughter of an famous anthropologist father and author mother, [Ursula K. leGuin really did not like Neil Gaiman's version of the Norse myths](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/29/norse-myths-by-neil-gaiman-review).  
&gt;What finally left me feeling dissatisfied is, paradoxically, the pleasant, ingratiating way in which he tells it. These gods are not only mortal, they’re a bit banal. They talk a great deal, in a conversational tone that descends sometimes to smart-ass repartee. This chattiness will be familiar to an audience accustomed to animated film and graphic narrative, which have grown heavy with dialogue, and in which disrespect is generally treated as a virtue.

145,"Air Force has only four combat-ready ""Eurofighters""
New massive problems with the ""Eurofighter"": According to SPIEGEL information, only a handful of 128 jet fighters are ready for action. In an emergency, the Bundeswehr could not fulfill its NATO obligations.

 
Visitors to the International Aerospace Exhibition ILA south of Berlin could admire the ""Eurofighter"" as a masterpiece of technology these days. The fighter jets of the Bundeswehr thundered over the exhibition grounds at Schönefeld Airport several times last week. The pilots showed daring maneuvers, especially the loops were spectacular.



The mission reality looks grim. According to SPIEGEL information, the Luftwaffe is struggling with a massive problem on the ""Eurofighter"". Most of the 128-strong fleet is closed to operations. The engineers are worried about the self-protection system because cooling liquid escapes from a tank for sensors, known in the jargon as Wing Pod.

Without the system Dass"", however, the jet is not ready for real missions. According to insiders, only about ten ""Eurofighters"" are expected to start real operations at the moment. This refers to the requirements of NATO or even an emergency over Germany, for example, the penetration of enemy aircraft in the air. With the small number, the German pledges to NATO are hardly to meet, in the Alliance has registered 82 ""Eurofighter"" for crises.

No self-protection no real use

The problem is complicated. Put simply, all ""Eurofighters"" on the wings have a sensor that detects enemy jets or attacks and warns the pilot. About half a year ago, it was discovered that the pod is no longer properly cooled. Since it is central to the self-protection system ""That"" and this must be active in all operational flights, the number of operational jets drops.

Just recently there was another problem added. Although the technicians could replace the defective pods on the wings, they needed a specific spare part to seal the cooling circuit. However, this, according to the sobering response of the industry, is currently unavailable because the manufacturer has been sold. The Luftwaffe has learned nothing about it, now you have to improvise.

Even before the discovery of the new problems, the ""Eurofighter"" was considered a problem child of the Luftwaffe. In an official overview for the Bundestag, only 39 of the 128 jets were listed as ready for use last year. This report, known in the jargon as clarification, was one of the grimmest reports of the many weapons systems and caused negative headlines. But at least it seemed as if the problems were no longer concealed.

Accurate number classified as ""secret""

That is precisely why the current reactions of the Bundeswehr are amazing. A spokesman told SPIEGEL that the ""up-to-the-minute availability"" of the ""Eurofighter"" currently looks better than in 2017, that exact numbers are classified as ""secret"". ""The Bundeswehr is currently fully committed to its current operational obligations,"" emphasized the Bundeswehr. Work is underway to make up for the shortage of spare parts.

The answer is, cautiously misleading. For example, the Luftwaffe counts all ""Eurofighter"" jets as available, which are allowed to fly at all. But this includes many airmen who do not have a functioning self-protection system. These may be used with dummies on the wings for training flights or maneuvers. Real missions, such as the airspace surveillance on the eastern edge of NATO, are excluded with these jets but.

Reckless tricks with deadlines

The Bundeswehr applies a similar reckoning trick when it claims that it fulfills all NATO obligations. Behind this is the procedure whereby Member States provide deadlines as to when the material needs to be operational. Germany has registered 82 ""Eurofighter"" for the ""High Readiness Force"" and the ""Force of Lower Readiness"".

This gives you 90 and 180 days to deploy ready-to-use jets. However, as there are currently no acute requests, the German Armed Forces can claim to comply with all current operational obligations. An insider: ""We can say with a good conscience that large parts of the troop are ready for use because there is currently no mission.""

The problem with the self-defense system is currently only one of the concerns of the military. Because the Luftwaffe has only two handful of air combat missiles for the ""Eurofighter"" fleet, according to SPIEGEL information only four jets are ready for real combat missions. Since you can not buy the weapons quickly, the Nato requirements are not met even with a lead.

172,"No, I don't believe so.  I think that most countries are unlikely to want to expend their credibility so freely.

I mean, the Kremlin has expended credibility on things that just do not gain Russia all that much, that I can see.

Russia running news stories on RT about civil unrest in the EU is a lot more conventional as propaganda goes, and that I expect.  There's no real claim there.  It's just giving disproportionate coverage to something.

That is not only common, but happens even independently of propaganda efforts.  For example, media provides coverage of, say, shark attacks.  That has, in the past, led to public hysteria over the (minimal) risk.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_the_Shark

&gt;The Summer of the Shark refers to the coverage of shark attacks by American news media in the summer of 2001. The sensationalist coverage of shark attacks began in early July following the Fourth of July weekend shark attack on 8-year-old Jessie Arbogast, and continued almost unabated—despite no evidence for an actual increase in attacks—until the September 11 terrorist attacks shifted the media's attention away from beaches. The Summer of the Shark has since been remembered as an example of tabloid television perpetuating a story with no real merit beyond its ability to draw ratings.[1][2][3][4]

Or mass shootings -- a decidedly rare form of death in the US, but overwhelmingly what people in Europe see in the news on the US, because it's particularly mediagenic, and *any* mass shooting makes the news.  Even if you focus on gun crime, some drug dealer in Detroit shooting one other drug dealer in Detroit is a considerably more representative picture of gun crime -- but you won't see much of it in the news, because it's not interesting to viewers.

And so if you're running a propaganda effort, you can leverage that effect, where people give disproportionate importance to things that they see covered a great deal, without burning credibility on making false claims.  The US provides a ton of coverage of Navalny on Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.  That's the kind of stuff that I'd expect most countries to do.

Russia, on the other hand, also has had this more unusual thing where when accused of something, she issues a mirror counter-accusation against the accuser, and spins off a bunch of conspiracy theories without much regard for plausibility.  I don't claim expertise with every form of state media out there, but that's not common in the US or the UK, and I don't think that Germany or France do it either -- at least, if it shows up on DW or France24, I don't see it.  Nor do I see the French foreign ministry spinning tons of conspiracy theories in response to France being criticized on something.

If it is used much aside from Russia, my assumption is that it's in non-English-language propaganda where I don't see it.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8gtqvy/deny_distract_and_blame_how_russia_fights/dyf8728/,vokegaf,1525407200

178,"\&gt;  Universities are supposed to places where ideas are debated

All ideas? and with equal weighting? A Philosophy department is very different from a natural history or geology department and even in the former professors make it very clear that not every idea and opinion gets equal weighting. Professors will straight up tell you ""you don't get to argue Kant was wrong as a first year. You don't know enough to have an informed argument on that."" Also, I disagree that ""Universities are supposed to places where ideas are debated"". Universities are supposed to be places of higher learning and the advancement of knowledge. The debate of ideas is part of that process but it is not the end goal. While a university is place where ideas are debated, that is not its purpose. It's not what it is SUPPOSED to do.

\&gt; So saying that because a group of people decided to reinforce their creationist ideas after a debate, is proof we shouldn't allow debates on all platforms at univerisites, isn't reasonable.

Creationism is objectively incorrect. For it to be correct at least 4 entire branches of science \(geology, biology, astronomy and paleontology\) would all have to be wrong about their most fundamental beliefs and a lion share of their findings over the last century. So yes. I would say that if a PLACE OF LEARNING MEANT TO ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE is leading to an increase in factually incorrect and unscientific beliefs, that is an argument against allowing the behaviour that is impeding the progress of knowledge.

\&gt; This statement seems to be implying that those who believed creationism only believed it more.

I believe it was that areas that were predisposed towards creationism saw a bump in creationist believers. Not that people who already believed believed more. What you seem to be missing is that nobody is unaware that creationists exist or that neonazis exist or what the general outline of their arguments is.  The type of person who is persuaded by neonazi or creationist rhetoric isn't the type of person who is dissuaded from those things by a public debate on the topic because the strength of the natural scientific view and the anti\-discrimination view doesn't come from the power of its rhetoric. It's a series of hard won facts and lessons. Neo\-nazi pro\-eugenics' strength comes from a partial understanding of the science behind it divorced from the related sciences around it. Same with creationism. They both operate on a little bit of knoweldge being a dangerous thing. It is much easier to put forward an argument that eugenics is good and correct in a 2 hour debate than that its not. To properly explain why it's NOT requires a background in the topic and few courses. Same with creationism. The length of time of a debate is enough to give a layman understanding of the topics thats based on valid science but misses the thousand caveats and nuances and case files and whatnot that need to come attached to them.

Nobody, in today's society with the knowledge we currently have, starting from a neutral position and doing their own research on the topic would come to the conclusion ""the earth is 6000 years old"" without being pushed that way by creationists. There's 1000 pieces of evidence against it for every argument for it. If you value scientific evidence that someone in a creationist vs scientist debate could put forward in that time then you already weren't going to become a creationist. So the only people they can get are the type of person who can be won over by a 2 hour debate that aligns with their existing views. Same with the neo\-nazis. The 3 hour rhetorical speech that plays to emotions and things people sorta thought were true all along is their wheelhouse far more than it is social and natural science's

\&gt; I get that can go the opposite way, but I would wager that the positive outcome is more often had.

As a social psychologist I would take that wager. Allowing views such as creationism and neonazi\-ism to have speaking roles in universities \(not to let people voice them in classes or student organizations mind you, but to actively pay people to come, give them an assembly hall to speak in, and promote them as a speaker on that topic\) is detrimental to the learning process and society at large by legitimizing views that we have moved past in the advancement of knowledge. Chemists don't have to go back every 10 years and defend their field against alchemists and phlogiston advocates, astronomers don't have to debate the merits of aether theory so why the hell do biologists, social scientists and humanities fields have to keep listening to people who don't understand our fields try to use them to justify genocide? Their science is wrong. We know their science is wrong. It just takes a long time to show all our work and we would be better served debating theories among ourselves and seeking new knowledge instead of going back and rehashing this old debate over and over again because free speech advocates decided that the fucking poorly educated genocide proponents need to be allowed to take up a speaking slot at my academy of scientific advancement.",,/r/europe/comments/8gnimv/crackdown_on_students_silencing_free_speech/dyf8doa/,fedora-tion,1525407444

After some thinking I decided that if I like them,  if I enjoy what they are creating it's not my god damn business what they are attracted to. They are what they are, they are not forcing their inclination on me or berating me for what I am, why should I do it? There's enough problems and anger in the world as it is. 

Also, Christian  religious establishment should be more tolerant. Jesus was good mate with a prostitute, wasn't he? And the rest of his crew were right weirdos. He taught tolerance. He taught that anger and violence that result from some of the old testament teachings are wrong. Yet church, especially Catholic (what an irony!), choose to be one of the biggest adversaries of universal tolerance.

218,"&gt; deplatforming in the way happening currently is counterproductive. 

I agree with this.  Here are some thoughts I've been kicking around for awhile, using Richard Spencer as an easy example:

I don't see the merit of Spencer being given a stage to say his piece for thirty minutes, followed up by a Q&amp;A with irate ""SJWs"" (not my word) unpreparedly sputtering fragmented, emotional ""rebuttals"" that will soon be sniggered at by Nazis on YouTube.

I also don't see value in completely deplatforming Spencer, which both allows him to play the victim, and drives the Nazis further underground.

What if we allow Spencer a platform, but only a platform of debate against a worthy opponent?

My vision:

Every university Spencer approaches welcomes him gladly--on the condition that his talking points are presented within a debate with their star pre-law/poli-sci/debate club student.

This kid studies Spencer's videos, researches his talking points, and forms rebuttals that are accessible to anyone, not just students of philosophy, history, geopolitics, genetics, etc.

And they debate.  The debate is fairly moderated, and Spencer's fallacies are explained, plainly, one by one.  If his opponent is skilled, (s)he will back Spencer into logical corners, over and over. 

Now THAT could be an extremely useful way to platform Spencer.  Using the Socratic method/dialectic, we can model *how* and *why* his ideas are flawed, rather than just telling people ""Nazis=BAD"" and expecting them to blindly follow.  

Socrates was (in the tellings of Plato) an expert in batting his lashes, acting dumb, and coaxing his opponents into ultimately admitting that their positions were logically inconsistent.

And that *process* is so valuable to witness and mull over.

This is why we learn about Lemarck while studying evolution.  It's why we learn about Freud while studying psychology.  It's why we learn about phrenology when studying race-relations.  We study Mill's theory of utilitarianism, and we recognize its strong points and weak points.

All of these ideas were groundbreaking in their time, and show bright people creating and processing *concepts* that hadn't been examined before, at least in literature.  

AND our species has refined those concepts, building upon them, adopting aspects we think logical while discarding those that are absurd, upon examination. 

The whole ""tHe JeWz/BlAcKz/MuSlImZ ArE hUmAnItY's BiGgEsT pRoBlEm"" is so easy to deconstruct and disprove.  

So, let's allow Spencer debate at any university.  Give him a platform, but contain that platform to a dialectic.

Hold on, i said you were has capable has any other man right after that, what i meant with the part that you got more help is that usually there are less girls in stem courses, and guys usually tend to look up to you and offer you more stuff than they would offer a male colleague, in no way im doubting you capabilities.

Same sex marriage existed in ancient times all over the world - China, Rome, Egipt.

Saying you 'support' gender roles as a standard frames the rest of your argument weird.

The predispositions you're talking about mean that, left to their own devices, the overall population is going to trend to those roles anyways, regardless of whether or not you support it. 

Saying you 'support' those roles in a cultural context would mean that you don't support the alternative, not that you're indifferent to it. If your belief is that people should just act however they feel most comfortable, that's different from saying you support a specific paradigm of those roles.

We did not fight a war, we hung on the best we could until a president was elected. Meanwhile amateur militant groups attempted to resist invasion in the east.

Plus heavily armed personnel almost instantly took over all government facilities, I’m talking bazookas, machine guns, grenades - the whole spiel.

Also, France is a NATO member, and does not share a border with Russia. This has nothing to do with the situation in Eastern Europe.


Regarding you not being sure about us standing a chance - frankly I couldn’t care less if you are sure or not - our military was bled dry by prior administrations, and our territorial integrity was guaranteed by major world powers (including US, UK, and ironically Russia). Russia was testing the waters to gauge the reaction it will get, its subversive warfare 101. They do a thing, deny everything - and play it from there. Who in their right mind would get involved? US? No way in hell US would start a military conflict, and if they did - it would end up like the Korean Peninsula is. 

Russia had their shit ready from the start. I mean fuckers were holding war games no more than 400km from Ukrainian border.

I think you’re overestimating the effect that would have on the American public. The best parallel I can give you is climate change denial. We gave deniers a public platform, and they used bogus studies to give themselves a vernier of respectability then flipped it from a factual debate to an emotional one, making any action on climate change an attack on white, working class Americans who’d be put out of work by regulations. They always lost the debates on the facts, but now [just 35% of Republicans believe global warming is caused by human activity](http://news.gallup.com/poll/231530/global-warming-concern-steady-despite-partisan-shifts.aspx?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosgenerate&amp;stream=top-stories) and there are campaigns to “teach the controversy” in schools. I worry that allowing white supremacists into the debate on race relations will go the same way, with bogus studies followed by an emotional appeal to white working-class Americans who’ll seize on any opportunity to play the victim.

Frankly, we never should’ve let them get to the point where we’d hear them cry about free speech when they’re excluded. They should be treated like people who think adults should be allowed to have sexual relationships with children. No one invites pedophiles to talk at universities because the only debate around the subject is how to deal with pedophiles.

281,"I actually barely remember passages from the book it's almost been 10 years. There are themes compressed in abstract forms in my head.

The general idea is He explains the reasons behind the phenomenon of most Evil Princes usually ending up in positions of power and maintain them far better compared to Good Princes, giving examples from history/politics/people and his own observations usually from Medieval Italy.

The Evil Princes bribe officials and armies, manipulate everyone,fake kindness to people who would be deceived if not threaten families and strikes fear into people's hearts. In short they do not stop at anything to gain Power, if they can't win by the fair rules they cheat, they do not hesitate to apply to the tools of scheming and duplicity. Their mindset is set to win and do what ever is necessary where they won't stop by the borders of any morality

The Good Princes are usually naive in a sense they do not expect such behaviors from their own brothers and even when they realize it they don't take proper and necessary precautions. Most of them are also naive in a sense they expect every body can be won through love, compassion and benevolence which is not the case for a great deal of people and what prepares their downfall is they usually don't expect betrayal and can't read people properly.

So the state usually falls into the hands of an Evil Figure and even worse it's their Good brothers who gave that power to them in a golden plate. , I remember how ironic this felt for me because Good Princes although with best of intentions caused their people to suffer greatly. I would say this had the most impact on my personality.

As you say what may be right in the US, could sometimes be viewed as extreme right in Europe or what may seem left in the US can actually be seen as right in Europe.

&gt; And also, this flies in the face of your claim that

I think that the family combo of 1 working other taking care of the home kids is a very good strategy, if its women working or men working is diferent.

I also think that women deal with psychological/emotional stuff better than men, thats the only reason why i think they are better for educating the kids/stay at home. Not because i think the  men have the right to be the ones out of the house, if the father is better than the mother doing that fucntion, then please go for it!

Gender roles doesnt mean that in any way. women are very efficient taking care of people, there is alot of work in that area.

It seems like the person who created it had at least good *intentions* (although the introduction reads like someone trying to convince you to join a cult or buy into their shares), but from there it slowly devolved into a forum primarily about anti-feminist assholes laughing at ""beta cucks"". You could argue that those people aren't the true redpillers, but theredpill doesn't that reputation for no reason. Or maybe you agree with them? There's a lot to pick apart with the belief that there are alphas and betas, and *some* of it might even be true, but ultimately, I don't have the spoons at the moment to argue.

365,"Scandinavian history student here. The Norse gods are actually incredibly badly recorded as well - contrary to popular belief we actually know somewhere between little and nothing about them. 

The vast majority of what we know is actually from an Icelandic skald (poet) named Snorri Sturlasson who was an educated Christian theologian writing about the religion of his ancestors - of many generations past, as he wrote them in the 13th century - which included a lot of similarities to religions we know he had learned about which means that most, if not all, scholars question to a very high degree his usefulness as a source. 

Christianity started becoming popular very early on in Scandinavia - contrary to popular belief, the Vikings were Christian long before their ""final"" invasion in 1066.

369,"A bit, yes.

Typically, a woman's strength is in the domain of social relationships. This gives many of them what to many men seems like an almost supernatural eye for reading people.

This often allows them to get a very clear picture of what type of guy you are upon seconds of meeting you. And when they do, they will not necessarily judge you by your ""professional success"", or your ""sweet bod"", but also by what your general demeanor makes them feel. No women like a weakling, yes, because that's a sign of a damaged person. But on the other hand, no women likes a psycopath devoid of humanity, empathy or emotion that's going through a script to get them to spread their legs, because that's the hallmark of a damaging person. 

This does not apply to casual sex, though... in which case your best move is to either say nothing at all and just fucking do it and the script is only gonna make it worst for them, or flex your social muscle, wits and charisma: Make them laugh **with you** (leave the laughing at you for the lovable rogues, though). And this last approach depends on a healthy dose of humanity and empathy towards your fellow man: You're not gonna make anyone laugh by making fun of the downtrend... At least not anyone you'd want to meet your mom.

385,"I’ll give it a shot. As humans we are born into a world of sexual competition. This is obvious to everyone but taboo to discuss. Red Pill tells frustrated men hat they are not getting what they want because they are not good enough for people to want to give it to them. 

After accepting this harsh truth, the sidebar is full of information about how to improve yourself - mentally, physically, and socially. 

There is real misogyny in /r/theredpill and there are misleading and outright false conclusions being marketed in the sub as well. The onus is on me, as an individual, to find the advice that is worth following. 

Here are some TRP guidelines that everyone will agree is common sense:

- Be strong. Lift weights or play sports, but be physically strong.

- Be confident. Act like you deserve respect, and don’t tolerate disrespect. 

- Dress well and get a haircut. 

Here is the stuff that is hard to say properly without coming off as a sexist, so a space was created where there is no need to sugar-coat:

- Everyone in the world is trying to survive and thrive. Don’t assume that because you have been there or gone the extra mile for a girl (or anyone,) that they will have your back when you are in trouble. Always have your own back and expect nothing from others. 

- Anxiety and timidity are nuclear-grade attraction killers. Never talk about your worries with someone you’re trying to hook up with. Always force yourself to close the distance in a safe and respectful way. If you don’t move the interaction towards intimacy, she will just let you do nothing and leave when you give up waiting for her. 

- Women are just as sexually obsessed as men, and they are going to fuck hot dudes to have fun. You have to accept this and realize that you would do the same. The solution is to be a hot dude, and to also let go of the desire to control others. 

TRP also strongly encourages consumption and application of stoic philosophy. Personally, I never speak of philosophy in conversation, but I have been teased for being “so stoic”. What I took from it, is that life will hurt you, and flailing about from the injury serves nobody. Your best bet is to take it on the chin and say “nice shot.” Then keep improving yourself until you die. 

I hope this has been relatable, at least a little. Its a tough world out there. ",,/r/europe/comments/8gnimv/crackdown_on_students_silencing_free_speech/dyethht/,triphoppopotamus,1525391360

416,"This has been an interesting discussion to view as someone in the US following the debate around deplatforming here. I do have a question though...

If I understand your position correctly, you're saying that it's important for us to have a visible debate, where people just being exposed to neo-nazi arguments are able to see those arguments in a wider context that includes their refutation, and that providing neo-nazis a platform at universities creates a stage for that debate. But isn't the discussion about whether neo-nazis should be given a platform the very debate you're advocating for? 

Perhaps the events in question are different I other places, but in the US the platform being given at universities isn't generally one of ""neo-nazi and anti-racist debate racism,"" but one of ""neo-nazi stands on a stage espousing views unchallenged."" The *debate* tends to take place beforehand, among people asking ""does this neo-nazi have legitimate information to impart to the student body?""

Edit to add: In this context, the platform becomes the outcome of the debate, rather than the debate itself, where providing a platform is the outcome ""yes, this person has something of value to share with the student body"" and deplatforming is the outcome ""no, this person does not have anything of value to share.""

I think it also bears consideration that ideas like ending slavery, civil rights movements, and similar all had to pass through this gauntlet before being given a platform. They began as marginalized views which had to *earn* a platform in the face of superior opposition. In contrast, white supremacy has never before had to earn its platforms; it's always been given a platform by default.",,/r/europe/comments/8gnimv/crackdown_on_students_silencing_free_speech/dyel2lb/,queersparrow,1525382882

In 1977, the ACLU defended the right of some nazi skinheads to march through a Jewish neighborhood full of holocaust survivors because *they considered it unconstitutional to deny the nazi fuckos the right to assembly.* Will you now accuse the 1970s ACLU of harboring nazi sympathizers?

It's shortminded, but you aren't going to fix that by explaining me it is Greece that needs the border guards.

The limiting factor to the number isn't Greece, but other countries in a more safe position where they can benefit from not being to pro-EU (or for that matter: having the EU be effective) due to local politics. That's why the number is 10000 and not 20000, which is what started this conversation. ",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/8gpmhm/european_commission_wants_10000_border_guards/dyelor1/,Sondar12,1525383471

He was also a Republican, and yet he gave a blueprint to the same dynastic family that tortured him, does that mean he suddenly was sympathetic to monarchs?, no it means hes pragmatic, and wants his fucking job back. This family also happened to be from the same city he represented previously. Florence. Because again, he was Florentine, and centered his life around Florence.  and literally all I said was he probably considered himself Florentine first seeing as nation states weren't really a thing, and he never acted officially to unite Italy he just wrote  to the Medici's in order to get another damn job in Florence. I never said he wasn't a sort of proto nationalist or that later nationalists weren't inspired by his writing. you immediately jumped on me and said I was uninformed and shouldn't talk because I suggested that Machiavelli wasn't first and foremost concerned with identifying as an Italian above all else for the entirety of his life.

The original poster decided to call him European and not Italian? That's fine, this is an informal forum after all. Should OP have called him European/Italian or just Italian? Maybe, still, there are not agreed or exact standards, so in the end it comes down to just how the viewer sees the world. OP probably sees Europe more as a single entity than a broken-down one so he calls him European. You have a different opinion of what Europe is.

Second, the idea that ""revealed"" ideas that are true but taboo to discuss lead to bad conclusions. Steven Pinker recently [made this point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=43&amp;v=kTiRnbNT5uE) as a criticism of political correctness and the danger it brings toward radicalization.

One thing I will argue *against* though is your suggestion that there is a trade-off. I argue that there is no evidence that allowing bad ideas to be heard and debated leads to bad ideas being believed. That requires some mental gymnastics.

For anyone that believes that hearing a bad idea makes people believe the bad idea, I ask if *you* personally would have your mind changed by hear that bad idea. If yes, then that is an admission that the idea is actually persuasive by even your own criteria and it therefore makes no sense for you to not want to hear it. That would be an indicator of you admitting to choosing to believe something because you *want* it to be true even though deep down you don't believe it actually is, which is a serious problem.

If the answer is no, then you are an elitist. *You* won't be convinced by bad ideas, but other people aren't as smart as you so you, as the protector of what is right and good, need to protect these poor sheeple from being convinced. That is an arrogant, elitist, unsupportable position to take.

Either way, it's indefensible. 

Furthermore, that is merely from *hearing* the bad idea. If the ideas are *debated*, then you hear both the arguments for and against something. For you to believe that people will be convinced by the *bad* idea, you would have to believe that the arguments against that idea are worse than the arguments for it, which leads us back to you being willfully blind to what you truly believe deep down in favour of what you'd like to be true.

Ultimately there is just no downside to open debate. The claims of a downside are not borne out of any evidence.

If you want to put a stop to bad ideas, openly debating them succeeds at it. Censoring them does not work. That is not how human psychology or thinking works, nor does that model even make coherent sense. That is not how bad ideas like Naziism or Communism spread in the past.

In fact, the way that they spread and did major damage was exactly what political correctness does; it censors dissenting views as being ""bad ideas"" and makes people pay a price for disagreeing. The resulting fear keeps the dissent from the bad idea from being spoken and from correcting the bad idea.

It is *only* bad ideas that need the protection of the censors, and it's in the other direction. For bad ideas to succeed, we must censor their refutations.

This is a key indicator of bad ideas, and believers in bad ideas. They can't win the arguments so they resort to suppressing them.

559,"Now let me think...

EU population is 511 million, as of january 2017. Polling age group would be about 100 million, more or less. They asked 6080 people. 6080 out of 100 million is:

    6080 is what percent of 100000000?
    
    6080 is P% of 100000000
    
    Equation: Y = P% * X
    
    Solving our equation for P
    P% = Y/X
    P% = 6080/100000000
    p = 0.0001
    
    Convert decimal to percent:
    P% = 0.0001 * 100 = 0.01%

The big issue with this ended up being that the very act of presenting both sides in a formal debate implicitly legitimized the creationist view because presenting two views as opposite one another implies they're both views with equal merit worthy of discussion and debate. When you invite someone to a university to speak or debate you are saying that that person has a view which is worth listening to at a formal place of higher learning and education. An institution giving a view a platform is itself a message about the value of that viewpoint. Universities are not open forums.

If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask. If this is your first time going, don't be overwhelmed by all of the things you could go and do or see.

749,"Wow, this post exploded, did I get linked somewhere? Seems weird that I got upvoted when the person I responded to didn't, when they're arguing a fair point.

Anyway, no, I never got their true motive before I guessed it. I've always been quite good at debating people and getting others to open up emotionally. To go a bit off topic, one of the things I realised early on in life was that people really looked down on emotional arguments, and so would justify their stance by pretending it was all logical, there was evidence, etc - it almost never is. I actually hate the idea that emotions are somehow illogical - they're almost always immediate, conditioned responses to things which have happened in the past. The usual example that ""your girlfriend is upset because you cheated on her in a dream"", I would contend is actually a reasonable response - the stimulus of a dream is illogical, but reacting negatively to a visceral feeling that you've been cheated on is what the majority of us would do, right? It's not an irrational reaction, it's just an irrational stimulus, and they're very different things. What you call cheap argument lines, I would call an inability to describe how you're really feeling - if you say you feel that your position makes you feel good, you'll be denigrated, and yet I suspect that most people hold their political belief because it ""feels"" better. Very few people can adequately explain why they believe in justice, fairness, equality, etc, because it boils down to ""well, it seems unfair to not be equal, and that feels wrong"". Yet, it's taboo to admit that, because we demonise emotion compared to logic despite the latter almost certainly inspiring the former.

So, if you go in with the idea that most arguments are predicated more on an emotional basis than pure logic - because arguments are fueled by passion, which is inherently emotional - you can guess what's really driven people to their beliefs. Now, in the example above, I've used a Nazi but really, the same pattern will apply to most people's political beliefs; at some point, you felt that your stance was morally correct, that it was correct in some emotional capacity, and therefore other people must be wrong, deluded, whatever to disagree and take the opposite stance. You have to bury into the true motives behind what makes people tick, and you can only do that by being kind and lending an open ear. And you know what? That usually fails too. I consider it a near miracle that ""Joe"" wasn't too far gone and could turn his shit around at uni just because he, like me at the time, was dealing with severe depression. It doesn't happen often, and that's why I consider stemming it as quickly as possible to be paramount - once someone's a radical, they need extreme positive stimulus to get out of that hole, and they will usually deliberately shut themselves off to that.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/8gnimv/crackdown_on_students_silencing_free_speech/dydwwji/,ColdStrain,1525361494

786,"&gt;Do you believe that the fact that Yugos were white and mainly Christian helped ease the backlash?

Im not  from Sweden, but i do know people who are migrants in Sweden, and this is just personal expirience so don't take it like evidence. 

But yes. Croats and Serbs who immigrated to Sweden,Switzerland,Austria and Germany have had much lesser backlash with the locals than middle easterners, because 1) as you said they are white and christian (Although Orthodox and Catholic), and 2) because there already were waves of Yugos before.  And afaik they integrated well. 
Bosnian Muslims land somewhere in the middle, not as severe backlash as middle easterners and not as lax as Croats and Serbs.

Dropping the sarcasm, The argument that speech is worth nothing if there is no one to hear it is one i sympathise with, speech is inherently social, and having a platform gives you social capital. The conservatives do not take this argument to its logical conclusion, however. Take private media for instance. Private companies can give their platform to whomever they want to, thereby having the same power as the students in the case of campuses, the power to deny speech a platform.The difference, of course, is scale.

853,"&gt; So in other words; a person who hates Jews \(not for conspiracy theories but because they are Jewish\) is an anti\-semite, yet this is not the moral equivalent of a person hating Poles \(again for the same reason\). And the reason for these 2 situations not being equivalents is because there's a bunch of unrelated &amp; irrelevant basement dwellers who blame Jews for everything. 

How is this in any way different to understand? I'm not talking about individuals here, but concepts. Anti\-semitism exists in countries where there isn't a single Jew, where 99,9&amp;#37; never ever have met one. I will accept an equivalency between anti\-semitism and some made up ""anti\-polonism"" if you point me towards all the anti\-polonists in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. 

&gt;I'm pretty sure a considerable chunk of western Europeans have strong negative prejudices against Poles.

That's what you said. And I said that this is something Poles like to believe. What claim am I supposed to support here? Eh? Read properly please. Your sentence doesn't make sense, I never claimed that Poles complaim about Westerners thinking they own everything. Wtf.

&gt;Why not? If you're against the state of Israel you're an anti\-zionist. What is your argument against this? 

I don't except the definition as such. You can't be anti\-zionist without being an anti\-semite in my eyes. It's a bullshit definition brought up py people who do not like to be called what they are. There is no distinguation to be made between the two.

&gt; A Jew getting beaten and a Pole getting beaten are no different, if both are hate crimes. Both parties have intentionally tried to pose as victims at times, but this fact is irrelevant when you have a beaten citizen in the hospital. 

And again you are trying to compare stuff which isn't even remotely comparable in scale or prevalance. To suggest it is is stupid and exactly the self victimization I was talking about. PIS and their minions are just trying to invent some outside enemy for people to rally against. As I said, same bullshit is happening with ""Polish death camps"", which is even more ridicioulus.

898,"French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in New  Caledonia on Thursday for a visit that precedes a referendum on  independence for the Pacific territory. His programme has aroused  criticism from both separatists and French loyalists.

Arriving after a three\-day trip to Australia, Macron declined to take a position on the [independence vote](http://en.rfi.fr/asia-pacific/20180328-new-caledonia-referendum-question-formulated-after-hours-deliberation),  although during last year's presidential election campaign he expressed  a preference for the territory remaining part of France .

The visit was an opportunity to ""pay tribute to some important  occasions in our common history, occasions which may have sometimes been  painful"", he said.

**Separatist hostage\-taking anniversary**

Among those painful occasions was the storming of a cave on the island of Ouvéa that saw 21 people killed.

Macron will take part in a ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of  the event, in which separatists of the Kanak and Socialist National  Liberation Front \(FLNKS\) killed four gendarmes and took 27 others  hostage.

When French commandos stormed the cave 19 separatists and two soldiers were killed.

A year later separatist leaders Jean\-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwéné  Yeiwéné were murdered by fellow separatist Djubella Wea at the monument  to the Kanaks who were killed.

Some of their relatives and local residents have threatened to  disrupt the ceremony, which takes place at a monument commemorating the  dead gendarmes, although other Kanak tribes have called on the  population to take part in it.

**Colonial history**

Saturday is the anniversary of the 1998 Nouméa accords, which ended  the violence and started a process of decolonisation and increasing  autonomy that will culminate in the referendum in November.

Macron will mark the occasion by presenting the local government with  the original of France's declaration of its colonisation of the  territory in 1853.

Apart from a desire to counter British and Dutch presence in the  Pacific, France's main reasons for taking over the territory was to  build a penal colony, which later served to imprison left\-wing rebels  from the [1871 Paris commune](http://en.rfi.fr/visiting-france/20110106-truth-buried-paris-cemetery-sculpture-mistook-famous-wall) and Algerians who fought [France's colonisation](http://en.rfi.fr/france/20170216-Algeria-Macron-calls-colonisation-crime-against-humanity) of their country.

The French president, the seventh to visit New Caledonia but the  first to go to Ouvéa, will make what is being billed as a ""major speech""  at a theatre built on the site of the penal colony.

**Loyalists to march for flag**

Of the archipelago's 270,000 inhabitants, about 40 percent are  indigenous Kanaks, 27 percent of European origin, the rest defining  themselves as mixed race or of other origin.

An opinion poll has shown a big majority likely to reject  independence in November's vote and some of the loyalist camp has  criticised Macron's visit as concentrating too much on Kanak identity.

They have organised a march in honour of the French tricolore flag on  Friday, supported by three organisations, including the far\-right  National Front.Local representatives of the mainstream right Republicans  will also join the demonstration.

""The head of state cannot just mediate and guarantee dialogie,""  Republicans Senator Pierre Frogier told a rally for the No vote in the  referendum on Wednesday.

As established by the European Commission which is verifing the spending commitments and the projects of programming of the Fesr funds [European Funds for Regional developement]. The one in Ottana its a one of a kind solar plant for its scale, its power levels and for its technological integretion.

The assessor for programming Raffaele Paci, together with the mayors of Ottana and Nuragugume Franco Saba and Federico Porosu and other edimistrators of the territory, the Bruxelles’ appointee Silvia Rescia and the representative for the Agecy for territorial cohesion Edmondo Mone have accompanied the members of the commission in the survey of the facilty, realised with 6 million and 600 thousand euros, half of which european. A model, as stressed more than once, that can be replicated with success in other areas of Sardinia.

947,"&gt; Was there any backlash upon their arrival

Lots, similar to today with middle-easterners from what I've heard. But I was young back then so don't have much direct experience of it. It's probably one of the reasons there's such a strong resistance towards anti-immigration politics here in Sweden today, because we have had several immigration waves before with various people, every time causing political upheaval and what not, but every time also ended up not destroying our society. 

&gt;do people hold any negative sentiments nowadays or has it calmed down after 90's? Do they and how they compare to the immigrants from outside of Europe?

I'm not sure, having a Yugoslavian name for example isn't nearly as much of a drawback as being called Mohammed or something like that. Mostly thanks to the Yugos having been here for a long time. The families that came here in the 60s are pretty much entirely integrated now as far as I know, which most likely helps the ones who came later. 

I think the more recent immigrants has made it a bit easier for them, we now have new scapegoats, but I think a lot of Swedes still have a tendency to bunch them in with all other ""brownish"" immigrants (I know Yugoslavians aren't very brown, but this is Sweden, remember, if you're not blonde you're a bit suspect, haha). I think a lot of it also comes down to how well you speak Swedish, and if you moved here as an adult you're most likely never getting rid of your accent. The kids are fine though, don't think they have any real problems. 

So far mostly talked about how Swedes treat them. As for how they behave(d), roughly the same as other immigrants as far as I know. Initially having trouble fitting in, but fairly quickly getting into it if they got an opportunity. I suspect some Islamic things cause more problems with middle-easterners, like their views on women. But as far as violence, crime, and stuff go I think it was roughly the same problems. And I guess the Bosnians brought with them their own little unique problems like the current ""grenade epidemic"" we are having, with grenades being smuggled in from the Balkans. 

Again, take this with a grain of salt since I was only a kid in the 90s, so I don't really have extensive experience of how it was back then. 

Generally with (refugee) immigrants here, the amount of problems we get seems to almost entirely be tied to how many we take in, not where they are from. Although obviously there are differences between immigrant groups, they are not very big compared to the differences between the average Swede and the average immigrant.

Meanwhile I get called a promoter of totalitarian ideologies for saying that it's ok to crack down on people harrassing others in the street yelling nigger, jew etc in their face.

I consider myself quite in the center politically with an appreciation of merits on both the left and right side of the political scale.

By population density: Mongolia would need to be just 1/10 as efficient as Finland to have the same pollution levels(which clearly [it isn't](http://maps.who.int/airpollution/)). Same as Germany needing to be 10 times *more* efficient than Finland to have the same pollution.  
(that on national level, by urban pollution alone instead, it has less to do with national density, and more to do with size of cities and their density)  

By territory: Mongolia forests cover only 11%, the rest is deserts and moutains. (Finland is 78% forests)  

Then also look at this [map](https://www.airvisual.com/earth).

The US military wastes far more money than the USSR and Russia do, why else would they buy $600 toilet seats? Does that extra $595 dollars make your shit fly out your ass faster? No. $2,000 for a computer chip from the 80's that wouldn't cost 30 cents today and no one else would ever want to buy that chip not even civilians because they have chips that are 1,000 times better in their phones (literally a statement from the manufacturer) and these chips could easily be replaced by multiple others chips that are far cheaper and yet the US military still buys that chip at $2,000 not 30 cents because just like for all the other stuff the US drastically overspends on they do not care, it is not their money they did nothing to get it and no one in Congress has anywhere near the power to drastically cut their funding. They get more funding when they don't even want it just like what is happening right now. Russia and the USSR has/had to care about cost because they do not have anywhere near the money to waste, so it really is not that hard to understand that Russia and the USSR would make stuff be more cost-effective for their military.  

Just read it for yourself:

https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/7/us-military-wasting-money/

https://medium.com/war-is-boring/heres-how-the-military-wasted-your-money-in-2016-81bbc217c662


Also for the US the F-35 is a multi-role aircraft which will primarily the replace the A-10 for ground support, it is not a designated fighter role aircraft, the F-22 is the air superiority role. Both of them use 4th generation stealth tech which is why Russia and China can supposedly already shoot them down as they have been saying and they are far larger than drones so they have a bigger signature. Then ask yourself 17 billion for a US aircraft carrier when a new 3 million dollar missile made in China can easily sink it, so why are you making more aircraft carriers? The US already has the small drones that can be launched from multiple different ships and soon subs, these unmanned drones and drone swarms are on par or already better and are in development to be here soon, the US will have 100x more of these drones than F-35s by 2026. 

And if you do not believe these drones are better then you can look up the comparison yourself, an F-35 can't go past Mach 6 while the drones replacing it can go Mach 12 easily, those drones can fly 5 to 10 times longer, are much more stealthy because they are much smaller and do not have pilots in them or really any ports other than the weapon and landing ports, they can carry the same payloads and they cost 1/30th of the price. Also it of course removes the aspect of losing a human life. That is why the F-35 will be obsolete in 10 years, why do you need the F-35 in 2026 if there are drones that do a better job than the F-35? These drones will replace every role that the F-35 does even taking on other aircraft, there really isn't a difference between launching a missile at a tank or an aircraft if they can see either one and guess what they can see both with some other type of recon drones that are even stealthier because they have almost nothing on them. 

The US is already making its replacement but it won't cost 1-2 million that the manufacturer said it will cost, for the US it will probably 5-10 million for one because the US doesn't care about cost like how Russia does.

That's the flaw right there. The need for a working class and menial, low-skilled labor is not growing, but diminishing day by day thanks to technological progress. Even middle-class jobs aren't safe. There simply aren't enough menial jobs to go around, at least such creating value worth paying a livable wage for. 

Ergo, you're ending up with a permanent, mostly jobless underclass whom you either pay for doing nothing, or who turn to crime and/or radicalize.

Actually the employer not the employee needs to request this. (source: https://www.ondernemersplein.nl/regel/tewerkstellingsvergunning-twv-voor-buitenlandse-werknemers/) 

&gt; national unemployment institute called UWV

The UWV isn't actually an unemployment agecy rather its the social security institute.

After your ""WW"" runs out you also go back to your municipality/city hall. 

&gt;The first 6 months (shortest time) they are not allowed to work and do not count towards the unemployment statistics.

In most cases it takes well over a year before they even get the chance to work even if they want to work. I'll try to find the source for this if I can find it and have the time, it was in NRC or Volkskrant a few weeks ago.

Because it takes so long before many are legally allowed to work many work illegally, e.g. in (turkish) bakeries and shops.

That's a verse that is being taken out of context. It's commonly referred to as the [Sword Verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Verse).

&gt; The Sword Verse is the fifth verse of the ninth sura of the Qur'an (also written as 9:5). It is a Qur'anic verse widely cited by critics of Islam to suggest the faith promotes violence against ""pagans"" (""idolators"", mushrikun), by isolating the portion of the verse ""fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them"".

&gt; Qur’anic exegetes al-Baydawi and al-Alusi explain that **it refers to those pagan Arabs who violated their peace treaties by waging war against the Muslims**.

The next immediate [Verse 9:6](https://quran.com/9/5-15?translations=20) (often excluded from quotes) says

Finland's air quality is the best in the world, it is clear from the recent published statistics. It is on its website.

In Finland, the concentration of fine particles on average is 6 micrograms per cubic meter, which is the lowest country in the world. Almost as few have access to Estonia, Sweden, Canada, Norway and Iceland.

The worst air quality in the Middle East and in Africa is based on statistics. At the end of the list are Uganda, Mongolia, Qatar, India and Cameroon. In the worst air quality countries, the particulate matter content is more than tenfold compared to the best, says the Finnish Meteorological Institute on its website.

The statistics published by the WHO have compiled data on fine particles from 2 500 locations in nearly 100 countries in 2008-2016.

Senior Scientist: A clear reason for Finland's top spot

According to Pia Anttila, a research fellow at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, there are clear reasons why air quality in Finland is the best in the world. According to him, in the Nordic countries, Canada and Estonia, far away from large-scale emission concentrations.

Anttila says that one of the reasons for the top is the advanced technology.

""We have been in the industry for environmental protection for a long time. Cars are relatively good when compared to the average car fleet in the world.

For Anttila, Anttila lists the fact that Finns are quite a bit.

- We do not get any more photochemical pollutants. There is no hot sun, no deserts and lots of rainfall and relatively humid climate. This is the sum of many things, Anttila explains.

He says that in the emerging countries the statistics must take into account the uncertainty of measurement data. The number of measurements may be small and the quality may not be very reliable.

- In Europe and North America, long-term air quality monitoring has been carried out, the measurement results are high and the quality is accurate. In Africa, the Far East and Latin America, measurements have only recently begun and measurements are one or two per country, he says.

Students will be banned from refusing speakers a platform at their universities under the first government intervention on free speech on campus for 30 years.

Sam Gyimah, the universities minister, will announce tough guidance on the issue at a meeting today, calling attempts to silence debate “chilling”.

He will accuse some student societies of “institutional hostility” to certain unfashionable but perfectly lawful views. A “murky” legal landscape, with guidance from various regulators, lets zealots censor those with whom they disagree, Mr Gyimah will say.

The new rules signal the seriousness with which the government is taking free speech on campus. The previous universities minister Jo Johnson said last year that the Office for Students, the new university regulator, would enforce existing measures.

Mr Gyimah has decided that the watchdog will use its powers to impose the government guidance. The OfS, which came into force on April 1, could name, shame or even fine institutions for failing to uphold the rules.

The last time the government intervened on the issue was in the Education Act of 1986, when a duty of free speech was imposed on universities. Ministers have grown alarmed at the number of “safe spaces” on British campuses. Originally intended to make sure debate was respectful and speakers were not shouted down, safe spaces have at times been used to silence opinions in case they are seen as offensive.

So-called no-platforming, where a person is prevented from speaking at a particular event or others refuse to share a platform with them, has also been used this way. It was originally a method used to stop fascist speakers.

Mr Gyimah wants action to protect lawful free speech on campus and a single set of guidelines would be “a new chapter” for openness.

“A society in which people feel they have a legitimate right to stop someone expressing their views on campus simply because they are unfashionable or unpopular is rather chilling,” he said before the meeting.

“There is a risk that overzealous interpretation of a dizzying variety of rules is acting as a brake on legal free speech on campus. That is why I am bringing together leaders from across the higher education sector to clarify the rules and regulations around speakers and events to prevent bureaucrats or wreckers on campus from exploiting gaps for their own ends.”

The guidance that governs free speech on campus is issued by organisations ranging from the Charity Commission to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. This is often exploited by opponents of free speech and “overzealously interpreted”, he will say.

The new rules will be drawn up by ministers, but will have input from the National Union of Students, representatives of university vice-chancellors and regulators.

A recent investigation by MPs found that campaigners against abortion, Christian groups and secularists were among those who felt that it was hard to get a hearing at universities.

Feminists who oppose transgender self-identification have also found it hard to speak on campus. The group Woman’s Place had to keep the venue of its meeting last week in Oxford a secret. When it leaked out, more than a hundred students protested outside.

Events involving MPs, including the Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, have been disrupted on campus. Events on Israel and Palestinian statehood are another target.

Many students and university leaders think that the problem of censorship has been overblown. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: “Tens of thousands of speaking events are put on every year across the country. The majority pass without incident. A small number of flashpoints do occasionally occur, on contentious or controversial issues, but universities do all they can to protect free speech so events continue.”",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/8gnimv/crackdown_on_students_silencing_free_speech/dydd7ow/,Jackkus,1525332694

This morning they came back prepared with riot gear, other emergency services, just stormed the place and overwhelmed everyone at 5 o'clock in the morning. This is a proven tactic and normally leads to no or almost no casualties.

Every now an then you can read about cases where the police face that big resistance that they withdraw. These cases always end up like this one that they come back one or two days later and then they don't knock on the door they kick it down.

Again, I'm no expert but when I hear things like the Count Dankula saga or Brittney Pettibone and Lauren Southern being denied entry I have to wonder why known hate preachers and ISIS combat veterans get such a warm welcome.

I live in Melbourne, but some of the attitudes here are beyond unrealistic. We are a nation of 25 million people crammed into 5 large cities and perhaps a handful of additional urban centres. In terms of population and capacity to handle large volumes of migrants, we are an incredibly small nation with extremely limited ability. Apart from those deluded types living here, I imagine that most Australians would look at what is happening in Europe with apprehension. 

I have to wonder if the controversies here impacted upon European attitudes in what now appears to be a disastrous way. I'm a firm believer in terms of refugees and migration, of helping people, but for permanent migrants in need of help it's sensible policy to let those stay with the ability or willingness to help themselves, and from what I've seen the migrant crisis in Europe, this has not been the case. First priority of any government should be to their own peoples, and any migration should be done in a measured and careful way to ensure continued social harmony as the first and foremost priority.

There therefore needs to be a serious reworking of whatever system is currently in place, including the possibility of refusing entry to anyone trying to enter a country without proper identification. For peoples trying to enter via the sea, ideally there should be offshore processing in countries like Tunisia or wherever elsewhere possible to deal with these migrants. 

For example, if Syrian refugees were to cross into Turkey without proper documentation, then Turkey would need issue such documentation. If these same refugees tried to cross another border such as Greece without passports or a document confirming their refugee status, then they should simply be refused entry. Turkey would therefore be responsible from that point on.

This of course is very simplistic overview, and there's no guarantee that certain countries will follow these measures, which is why diplomatic and economic means should be implemented, including diplomatic or economic sanctions where necessary, to ensure these countries are at the very least incentivised to help or assist in dealing with the problem.

These structures are kept in place through inheritance. Wealth stays at the top.”**

The state must enforce its laws, it must exercise its monopoly on violence or those laws and that state are proven weak.

In peaceful countries, the monopoly the state has on violence is so rarely challenged on this scale that they don't know how to deal with resistance like this.

Spain's GDP is in historical maximums, the GDP per capita surpassed Italy and by the end of this year it will surpass New Zealand too. **All of the loss from the past crisis was recovered in 2017. Now it's all surplus.** The deficit keeps being lower and lower, as the debt. The unemployment made an almost unbelievable decrease of +10% in just 40 months ! 

The only thing Spain didn't recover yet it's the official unemployment rate. Yes, it was 10-11% and now it's 16% but by the end of 2018 it will be probably 14-15% so what's left to recover homeboy?

Your ignorance (or bias?) Is so huge that you never mention the situation in Italy which is much worse than in Spain except for the unemployment, and in youth unemployment both are almost equal.

Italy has a stagnating economy right now with a massive debt and small growth so it is way more similar to Greece yet you always compare Spain with the situation of Greece which is a world apart.

It is not for the sake of a good public administration that it is required, but for the security in the pursuit of the highest objects of civil society, and of private life.” Democracy is essentially a means, a utilitarian device for safe-guarding internal peace and individual freedom. As such it is by no means infallible or certain.

1552,"illiberal democracy = 

&gt;Fareed Zakaria explains the concept of illiberal democracy in his book The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad. Liberty and democracy may go together in the West, he says, but they are not necessarily connected. Indeed, the curtailment of liberties may be popular and have the support of the majority of voters. He argues that, “democracy is flourishing; liberty is not.” This brings to mind the old 19th-century liberal fear of a tyrannical majority and the subsequent intellectual effort to cordon off individual freedom from majority opinion and decision-making. Democracy is fragile, its self-regulating mechanism is often sluggish, and it is highly vulnerable to breakdown during the lag between repressive action and an effective critical response. Zakaria argues that Russia is democratic but also illiberal, pointing to Vladimir Putin’s “superpresidency” and restrictions on the media.

&gt;Let’s see how well Zakaria’s concept applies to events in Russia. How is it that a constitution that provides for the separation and division of power and enumerates fundamental rights does not protect liberty? The 1993 constitution of the Russian Federation is a mixed or hybrid presidential-parliamentary constitution, similar to the French constitution (also drafted in an atmosphere of coup and crisis). There is a dual executive with a directly elected president, who has to achieve 50 percent of the vote in one or two rounds of voting as necessary, and a prime minister.

&gt;The prime minister is chosen by the president and confirmed by the Duma, the lower house of the Russian bicameral parliament. Like the French president, the Russian president has the power to dissolve the lower house and call new elections. The Duma is directly elected using a German-style mixed-member proportional system of election. The upper house, the Federation Council, is composed of representatives of the federal regions and republics. The constitution provides for freedom of speech, a free media, and a constitutional court. There is a separation of powers and a division of powers, as well as a judicial branch with long-term if not lifetime judges.

&gt;In America we commonly associate these features of constitutional design with the protection of basic liberty within a democratic framework. In Russia this constitutional design produces democracy, but also “illiberalism.” To understand what is happening we might be tempted to fall back on the history of freedom in Russia, from czars to commissars. Instead, it is worth thinking about leadership, the decisions being made, and recalling the concept of power.",Bologna,/r/europe/comments/8gje5o/brussels_unveils_battle_plan_to_hit_illiberal/dycqz8l/,standy85,1525304626

Yes Poland exports people because Poles are hard working and are not afraid to move abroad to earn money instead of sitting on social benefit. Unlike Netherlands or France we didn't have colonies in which we abused, enslaved and tortured people so we have no moral responsibility to accept people from vastly different cultures from ours which will only create issues. They won't want to live in Poland either way, so us refusing them is win/win for everyone involved.

*illiberal democracies are increasing around the world and are increasingly limiting the freedoms of the people they represent. Zakaria points out that in the West, electoral democracy and civil liberties (of speech, religion, etc.) go hand in hand. But around the world, the two concepts are coming apart. He argues that democracy without constitutional liberalism is producing centralized regimes, the erosion of liberty, ethnic competition, conflict, and war. Recent scholarship has addressed why elections, institutions commonly associated with liberalism and freedom, have led to such negative outcomes in illiberal democracies.*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiberal_democracy

*In political science, democratic backsliding is ""the state-led debilitation or elimination of the political institutions sustaining an existing democracy,""[1] Democratic backsliding may occur when essential components of democracy are threatened; this may occur, for example, when:[2]*

*Free and fair elections are degraded;[2] liberal rights of freedom of speech and association decline, impairing the ability of the political opposition to challenge the government, hold it to account, and propose alternatives to the current regime;[2]*

*The rule of law (i.e., judicial and bureaucratic restrains on the government) is weakened,[2] such as when the independence of the judiciary is threatened, or when civil service tenure protections are weakened or eliminated.[3]*

*The government manufactures or overemphasizes a national security threat to create ""a sense of crisis,"" allowing the government ""to malign critics as weak-willed or unpatriotic"" and to depict defenders of democratic institutions ""as representatives of a tired, insulated elite.""[3]*

1635,"Yes, the US defense budget is quite bloated, and the political strength of the defence industry isn't really healthy. On the other hand in the face of emerging powers like china the US main assets are its soft power, its diplomatic network, and its huge military superiority, which also back up the network of allies, treaties and relationships the  US have. These are the tools the US built during its decades as the predominant superpower, and what it is using to try to keep its predominance. I really don't see the US relinquishing this any time soon, in particular with china currently progressing against the diplomatical ""containment"" (and honestly, from a purely geopolitical point of view, pulling back of the TPP was really bad move from the US). 

&gt;no longer think it's worthwhile to maintain such ""dominance"".And we've elected a President who feels the same way.

Wasn't part of Trump's campaign (and occassional presidntial declratios) on the topic of a diplomatical/economical confrontation with China and trying to ""keep America number 1""? Hard to conciliate ""make america great again"" with ""not maintaining dominance"", in particular when this dominance built the US prosperity and ""greatness"" in the last century.

I dunno, I'm not convinced on the reliability/consistency of his foreign policy. He had a relatively isolationnist campaign but all in all doesn't seems to have done much. How is the military budget for his first year?

&gt;But it will take courage for European leaders to seize the political opportunity

Eh, personally as a french with a kinda gaullist view of foreign affairs I wouldn't mind NATO dissolving and being replaced by a more european organisation, with France playing a pivotal part in it. But most european countries don't have that much ambitions of diplomatical independance. I guess the resurgence of Russia's threat and trump's perceived unreliability by europeans push a bit in this direction, but I really doubt the US will give up NATO, it's far too practical. For exemple strengthening military ties with eastern europe is both giving the US an ally against russia/a way to bother it AND a mean to reinforce the US' influence in the EU.",Come and see how die a Redditor of France!,/r/europe/comments/8ggedm/only_4_of_germanys_128_eurofighter_jets_combat/dycj7km/,Pelin0re,1525296612

1708,"&gt; but it is a core value to stand together and help other EU countries when they need help. So either you accept the European Idea that we are in a boat together and try to solve problems together. Or you work against that European Idea and don't help other European countries. You can cherrypick all you want about ""this is not included but that is"", this point is about European solidarity. Either you show it or you don't. We cannot make a written statement about every single crisis that will happen in the future, if solidarity is needed, you have to show it. Either you have understood the European Idea or you haven't.

I'm going to repeat myself - quotas are just one way to show solidarity, rejecting them doesn't mean you reject solidarity altogether. Quotas aren't even a solution that would tackle any of the roots of the crisis. Our countries simply want to have a say in how the migration issues will be solved, we do not just want to accept whatever measures the Commission or WE countries come up with, you can't just shut our mouth up with 'muh solidarity'. Solidarity is not some magical word that you can say to get us to do everything you want. Quotas are simply a system that isn't acceptable to us. That doesn't mean we want to do nothing. My country with the cooperation of your country has just finished building a large refugee camp in Syria. We are also providing funds for Libyan Coast Guard. We are very active in Iraq as well. In Syria we are the only country in the EU that has its embassy open despite the fact that our staff is risking their lives there. Thanks to them, we have better access to humanitarian help distribution.

We have also tried to take refugees directly from Middle Eastern refugee camps. Do you know what happened? A big part of them left to Germany after a month here, another big bunch tried it as well but was caught at the borders and after that they decided to rather go back to Iraq. And as for those who made it to Germany - your country hasn't even been able to return them back. The whole project was just a gigantic waste of money, just like the stupid quota system. Just because we don't want to take part in that doesn't mean we do nothing.

&gt; the arguments used to make that point, by politicians, newspapers and here on reddit, were the arguments racists and nationalists use and the motives to fight those quotes were the motives racists and nationalists use.

Some of the arguments and some of the users - sure, I can't deny that. But it's definitely not everyone. There are completely rational arguments against the quotas system as well.

&gt; the voices about war reparations from Germany are loud in the PIS in Poland. The tendency to accept an erosion of civil and societal achievements and human rights, which we fought hard for, is growing in EE. Democracy is in danger in Poland and Hungary especially. Talking to my grandfather aged 97 this weekend (who was born in today's Czech Republic and had a hard time giving up the farm his family had built up over 300 years), he compared the situation today to the situation he grew up in and he does see similarities. The number of people who dominate the discussion with loud and simple (and wrong) solutions to complex problems is rising, and the diskussions are filled with hatred, distrust and malevolence. The discussions are not about working together but about rejection and mistrust. The voices for a ""new leader"" who can solve the problems with lots of power in the state get louder and democratic achievements are slowly getting destroyed. The problems of the change of society under new economic and technical situations (a.k.a. capitalism as Marx predicted) are catalyzed into nationalism and xenophobia. You don't want a pre-WW2 environment? A Europe dominated by strong leaders, nationalism and xenophobia? Then stop working towards it.

You think I'm happy with that? You think I enjoy it to watch the political culture in my country and countries around my deteriorate? No, of course it sucks a lot. But it's not just an EE trend. The liberal democratic model is suffering setback everywhere. The US, UK, but even in continental Western Europe. Eastern Europe was simply hit with this trend when our democracies were still young and thus more vulnerable.

When it comes to the EU, the population in my country really is quite eurosceptic. But it's also not just something that we decided malevolently just to piss you off. This is simply what our mentality is like. We are instinctively distrustul towards large foreign powers that have some kind of influence over us. Our history has turned us into a cynical nation that doesn't believe in 'big ideas'. The historical narrative as it's taught in our schools is that of a small nation that historically has been always on the defensive against bigger entities that seeked to control it. This is what an average Czech thinks of international politics. The average Czech is sceptical about the notion of a foreign entity that might mean it well with us, because historically foreign powers always just fucked us over. It's similar in the case of other CEE countries.

We are simply very sensitive about our sovereignity, about any real or perceived foreign interventions in our affairs and when the EU and WE countries try to coerce us on such issues like immigration, which are sensitive here on its own, even without foreign interventions, then it simply creates some very negative feelings.

&gt; there may be a will by an overmotivated and underqualified Czech commisioner eager to please here home country with easy solutions to complex problems, who doesn't know the rules of the free market and the text of the law, but there is no possibility to make a law for what ingredients a product needs to have in a country.

It actually now has the support of Juncker as well, not just the Czech commissioner. The law of course will not say what each product needs to contain, it will only ban dual quality of the same product sold with the same label in different EU countries. So the companies will have to either clearly change the label or make the composition the same, otherwise it will be labeled as a misleading practice exactly how it should.

&gt; However, in the future the Commision will be able to decide to cut the funding for EE countries if the democracy is in danger (or if say fuckyou to EU solidarity). The EU council will be able to stop this descision with a qualified majority. Good luck Poland and Hungary getting that.

This whole article is just 'European Union bad Albania Stronk'.

The numbers she cites are dubious. [According to Europol](https://www.europol.europa.eu/socta/2017/organised-crime-groups.html) there are 5000 organize crime groups, not nearly 40000 as she describes. In fact I could find none of the 'Western media statistics' sources where she got these statistics from. The other problems she mentions, Greek economy, corruption and the Mafia of all things, are sharp in decline in the EU. Unlike Albanian, where corruption is only growing. And even if they were both stagnate or decreasing, then still the widespread corruption in Albania does not compare to the corruption in EU countries.  And why is the fact that 'drugs have been legalized in some EU member countries' of note, those same countries have very low levels of drug abuse and drug related deaths. Unlike some other countries that wage war on drugs (\*cough\* the US \*cough\*).

I would personally love to see Albania join the EU in my lifetime, but blaming the widespread corruption and internal problems on too little help from the EU is just ridiculous. The EU isn't a charity organisation. The EU is against Russian investment because Russia has a history of funding corrupt politicians. In I don't know, Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia.

NATO countries following the US in afghanistan, and some in Irak is another good exemple.
More than just some military assistance, the precious thing for the US is the diplomatic backing, to avoid unilateralism and diplo isolation.


Military hegemon DOES translate in diplomatic influence. That's the case of NATO, that's he case of France within the EU, that was the case back to the likes of Athenes in the league of Delos. To quote the [encyclopedia](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/international-organizations/north-atlantic):

&gt;The largely unchallenged American dominance of NATO was the most important and most powerful tool at the disposal of the United States to maintain its influence in Europe and beyond. More than a decade later this was still the case. In view of the increasingly frequent economic and trade as well as political and strategic disagreements in transatlantic relations in the early twenty-first century, Washington's efforts to bolster NATO and turn it into one of its main pillars of influence in the contemporary world was hardly surprising. NATO still provided the United States with a crucial instrument of global leadership.

I'm not trying to imply that, I just point out that your Turksih propaganda message conveniently omits any reason for that attack, and that it also very conveniently uses the term ""Swedish citizen"". That's very selective ""reporting"" to say the least.

It's a fact that Turks and Kurds in Europe often don't play nice when they meet at demonstrations, and that they have a history of acting aggressively all over Europe, both towards one another and towards other. So to see a clash here is no surprise. To not see the reason for the clash mentioned in that propaganda article is.

Your desire to post Turkish propaganda here only proves that you are trying to push just one side's message. No matter how much you try to pull my words out of context, you still are pushing propaganda and trying very hard to make one side look bad while very conveniently ignoring anything bad by the other side.

&gt; 
&gt; Image
&gt;

&gt; Between 2000 and 2015 between 79 and 83 % had a positive attitude towards the Bundeswher (Source)
&gt; 86 % think the Bundeswehr is a ""natural part of society""
&gt; 56 % say the feel deference towards the army
&gt; 56 % said they are proud about them
&gt; 53 % are thankful (for example for their support in fighting a flood)
&gt; 15 to 20 % reject everything regarding the military, asking which negative emotions they associate with the Bundeswehr, 26 % said doubt, 22 % fear or lack of understanding (""Unverständnis"", hard to translate) - 10 disdain or disgust
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Date: 2013

The Bundeswehr's own Social Science and Military History Center has cast doubt on whether the number of ""support"" really means ""support"" and rather not ""tolerance"" (and an indifferent one at that). Generally germans may ""support"" the Bundeswehr in polls, but that does not lead to a feeling of responsibility or real interest. It also neither leads to a willingness to take on more responsibility nor does it generate support for higher defense spending.

Boy, 5, is found frozen to death

Winter's toll: Sub-zero temperatures claim a child's life as forecaster s warn of more bitterly cold weather
Monday 29 January 1996
A five-old-boy who vanished after going out to build a snowman was discovered frozen to death in a back yard close to his home yesterday.

Police abandoned a murder inquiry - which began at noon when Damian Williams's body was found - after a pathologist discovered ""features consistent with death from hypothermia"" and ruled there were ""no suspicious circumstances"".

Damian, of Aubrey Street, Middlesbrough, disappeared after telling his mother Patricia, 25, he was going out to build a snowman on Saturday morning. She reported him missing at 2pm. The body was discovered by a police search team in the yard of a derelict house in Egerton Street, 200 yards from his home.


Superintendent Maurice Jones told a news conference that the possibility that Damian might have fallen, become unconscious and died as a result of the cold weather could not be ruled out.

Another theory being considered was that the boy got into the yard, then found himself unable to reach the gate latch to let himself out. The walls of the yard are more than 6ft high.",,/r/europe/comments/8gg9jq/in_front_of_the_antwerpen_cathedral_theres_a/dyc2b2g/,Mike707707,1525282081

With each passing year, a more and more narrow group of people has more and more power. With the fall of every currency, the group within control becomes narrower (then: 30 central banks, in the future: 1 central bank), but their power rises at the same time.

They are already doing it: before devaluation of money they are buying gold, real estates, shares and other, safe currencies, then they are doing their thing, people are losing money, then when the currency is at lowest, they sell their staff and then reverse the whole thing. This carousel revolves indefinitely. They get richer only from spinning the carousel while producing nothing of value.

If there would be one day one global currency, then whoever is in charge of it could straight out dictate of how much money do you and everyone else have.

Every additional currency is an additional break to the carousel and to the dictatorship.

ffs learn your history.

Liberalism = in essence and i summarize, equality for all under the eyes of the law, and social progress, for example womens rights, gay rights, minority rights, the civil rights act is another example.

Conservatism = to conserve the morals and values of your time or that of those that came before you. To commit to traditional values while oppossing social change or progress.

Slavery at that point in time was a product of its time and quite traditional, to conserve it, would be in essence conservative.

those that oppossed it and wanted to free the slaves and followed the values of progressivism.
Lincoln believed in that and freed them.
his action of freeing the slaves was a PROGRESSIVE action.

him following the 1860 doctrine of conservatism has nothing to do with the action of freeing the slaves.

Just think about it for a moment. Very low unemployment is the very best tool how to get what you want from employer. And if some employer cannot afford to raise your wage anymore, then he have to either invest in automatization and increase productivity or close the bussines because what he do is not profitable enought. Guess what, due to extremely low unemployment, people from this closed factory will simply go to work in another factory which is more successful and capable of paying higher wages.

Migration crisis comes from elsewhere, it started by Arab Spring and with seeing that's not the way to brighter future, people started migrating here in vast numbers.

I don't think that this problem with poorer countries having a bigger say is somehow connected to the migration crisis. Sure, it points at it and says ""this is a huge problem"", but the migration crisis is a problem on its own, not just because it's pointed upon.

A party and a vanguard are not the same. The SPD was a party, the Bolshevists a vanguard.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;No.
&gt;
&gt;What do you call the 'free access to goods &amp; services'? What is the aim, then?


The aim is, in so far as there is one, Marx himself didn't write much about politics, to abolish private property. Free access to the goods of consumption isn't an aim, it's a theorised outcome. Certainly Marx thought communism would improve equality, but that was hardly the point.

 Marx himself was very hostile to moral theorising and was an economist, not a politician.

Unlike communism, capitalism isn't a theory with practitioners. Communism has been invented by thinkers, mainly Marx, then put into practice. Capitalism started in cities like Venice, Florence or Antwerp centuries before anyone started to think about it.

Also, even if there are many capitalist societies that are awful, or violent, one can't look at current Norway, Japan or Switzerland, just to name a few, and end up thinking that these places are obviously a dangerous failure. So yeah, #NotAllCapitalists has a basis in reality.

2184,"&gt; Well that's the thing. Marx didn't practice communism in the Soviet Union. The guy was a theorist. If you're judging him you should be judging him about his work not about how his work was mal-practiced. 

I do not agree with this. I judge a person by the truthfulness of theri thesis. In his case, Marx made the case of 'if only the opressed could stop being opressed and take back the power, the world will become a better place'. No. That is wrong .Equity does not work. We tried it multiple times. It seriously murderous. Marx is simply wrong.

&gt;And this is why i said there's a difference between Stalin and Marx. You keep talking about the latter, not the former. My entire point was that the practice didn't follow what the theory was preaching. Marx didn't do something wrong. Stalin sure did. 

And my point is what the practice showed , was the conclusion to the flaw of the theory - in this case that equity is somehow a possible concept among humans.

&gt;You can say its flawd or can't be achieved but equiating it to Stalinism and dictatorship is straight out wrong.

There are still lots of unexplored places and if you are into history and nature you won't be disappointed. Some of the oldest modern human sites are in Oman! Lots of bronze age and iron age archaeology too.
Lots of hidden beaches, little stone villages carved into the mountains and fantastic roads for road trips! 

No direct flights from Poland but Oman Air has direct flights from Munich, London and Milan. Qatar Air has few good connections from around Europe via Doha. Both very good airlines. Qatar Air is also very affordable these days. They are being squeezed economically by their neighbours with some stupid sanctions so have to keep the prices down.

2220,"&gt; If you want rules or mechanism to counter corruption then they should be clearly defined and should not target specific members, but absolutely all of them.

Yes, I absolutely agree.  I wish I could give more than one upvote for this.

Also, I want to re-iterate what I thought I was clear about - I am a huge fan of consistency, and of realistic, achievable goals, as well as a degree of compromise in how to get there.  You can't just say ""grr, you are bad, here is punishment"" - there has to be a willingness to accept realistic limitations and tradeoffs, such as the likelihood that EU membership will improve certain things more than a pre-accession period.

&gt; If you go by arbitrary 50 on Corruption Perceptions Index,

I used that as an example.  It's a straw man to provoke discussion - and in a geopolitically complex context like this, I hope that nobody would ever just pick an abritrary index, no matter how much respect I have for TI.  I made a point of naming any number of factors - corruption is just one of them.  

The CPI is an indicator, nothing more, of just one such factor - similar to RSF's press freedom index, Freedom House's democracy index, and many others.

However, the EU and its institutions are mature and capable enough to come up with much more detailed, accurate measures along any number of axes.

&gt; Every goverment is prone to corruption, lets try not to blind ourselves that only specific countries suffer from it. 

Again, I agree, but I think that while a Nordic level of accountability and fairness, is good to strive for, human nature means nobody will ever be perfect.  Nonetheless, it is false equivalency to claim that ""all corruption is the same"".  There is deep-down systemic and systematic corruption, and there are occasional, exceptional incidents.  There is corruption affecting massive levels of state budgeting, and individual corrupt episodes that, however contemptible, do not affect entire populations.  The key is to find the right degree to go after.

Ah, the good old victim theory is still strong in Austria I see: [Only very late, that is in the year of 1998, and under massive international pressure - and especially due to complaints of the United States -, did Austria appoint a committee of historians of the Republic of Austria that should research and report on the deprivation of fortune from 1938 to 1945 as well as the restitutions and compensations after 1945. Many restitutions followed as a result of this research and these efforts. In summary, the course of events under constitutional law of 1938 as to the Republic of Austria has to be regarded as a **janus-faced act**; and this only in conjunction with various and diverse interests during the Cold War. Whereas, observed from one perspective, the state Republic of Austria fell prey to NS-politics, from another perspective, citizens of the Republic of Austria were compliant actors when it came to the enforcement of NS-policies.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_theory) ",I want to get off this ride,/r/europe/comments/8g8min/european_and_nearby_countries_ever_at_war_with/dybdss5/,BrexitHangover,1525253503

2288,"&gt; but neither scientific nor representative of the whole. In the following map you can see that there is a good amount of similarity between Central European countries, as well as pick up the trend line of Latin, Anglo-Saxon or Slavic groupings.

You seem to be the one who lacks scientific understanding. Given a population of a few thousand people that live relatively close, I can find a few genes that are more common within this population. But that is different from forming a distinct group that is defined by genes, because there is always interbreeding. What I cannot do is analyze the DNA of every single person and correctly determine the ethnicity which he belongs to.

&gt; But criteria exists to measure it. Language, faith, culture and genetics for example.

They don't ""exist"". They were arbitrarily chosen. There is no reason to categorize this way. 

&gt; The beauty of this is that as humans develop, we tweak these factors, until eventually a new ethnicity emerges. This evolutionary process has been happening since the dawn of Man, and it’s shaped by outside influence (geographic, social, economic) as well as conscious decisions about faith or ones reproductive partner. It’s fairly organic, and unfortunately for you, unstoppable.

No, humans develop individually until a guy declares himself ruler of his tribe and forces an identity on his underlings. The rest is just the tribes merging into ever bigger structures with supposedly monolithic cultures. But there is a limit to how big a human monolith can be, so finding identity in the political construct that you are living under, gets increasingly difficult, because it was dumb to begin with.

&gt; You realize if you eliminate ethnic groups, you eliminate all of human diversity? As long as people have freedom, we will choose to develop in certain ways, leading to affinity between like people. This makes ethnic groups. You state you want no ethnic groups, but want freedom. These two things are contradictory and cannot coexist. 

You've got it the other way around. Ethnicities, races, religions. These are the things that are holding back diversity. Imagine you were eliminating musical genres. You'd be lifting restrictions, not creating them. The music would be more experimental, more free form, more diverse. There isn't a magical force that would make me and my neighbor create German culture should it suddenly vanish from this planet.

&gt; while political divisions failed to take into account ethnic groups. Certain groups had essentially no political representation while others were trying to monopolize it.

So, there'd be no conflict, if people weren't separated into meaningless groups.

&gt; On top of that, the ruling communists were themselves complicit in mass executions in ww2, and they obfuscated history even more.

So you are hating a group of people for what a former generation did and you are telling me that your hate was not taught? Try to think about, why you hate people for what their grandparents did.

&gt; But don’t belittle others that do find solace in national or ethnic pride. You have no idea what some people have done or were forced to do just to be able to be who they are

I know exactly what each and every one of them has done: They were born at a certain place. That is everything that people which are proud of their ethnicity or nation could ever achieve. If they did anything meaningful, they'd be proud of that.

&gt; and you sound like a bigot when you belittle them for having pride in this.

I am a bigot, because I belittle bigots? K.

&gt; Have you ever stopped to consider that someone might be proud of their origins because their major accomplishment is surviving attempts to be killed because of that? Would you tell the traumatized Yazidi people who survived a genocide at the hands of ISIS that they’re losers if they feel any pride in surviving and holding on to their faith?

If you take that accomplishment to put yourself and your people above others, sure. Why not be proud in the fact that you personally happened to survive a Genocide?

2326,"&gt; You are most definitely wrong, Britain could not get rid of its subject countries fast enough after World War II.

Britain kept fighting to hold on to its colonies as long as it possibly could. It was lack of capacity that kept it from holding on to them longer. Through the 50's and 60's there was military operation after military operation to try to safe what could be saved. It was first through the 60's this started to change. Even so, Zimbabwe didn't get independence until 1980

&gt; For example the crown jewel in the British Empire was India, and when did we pull out... 1947

Because it was accepted there was no realistic alternative. This was the point: That where France with the exception of Algeria (which was a very special case - Ageria had been made legally part of France proper, rather than administered as a colony; it was seen by those who wanted to keep it as more similar to e.g. the Northern Ireland situation than as a colony demanding independence - there were 1m+ French settlers there) and Indochina, France let their colonies go without much resistance, while the UK had to be pressured into independence in most cases, in many cases through decades long campaigns of civil disobedience and resistance.

2381,"'**Annoyed’ Hammond seeks to sabotage Galileo satellite project**

*Move to prevent technology transfer from Britain as row with Brussels escalates*

George Parker and Peggy Hollinger in London 5 HOURS AGO

Philip Hammond wants to sabotage the EU’s €10bn Galileo satellite navigation project by attempting to disrupt the transfer of sensitive encryption technology from Britain.

In an escalation of a row over UK participation in Galileo after Brexit, the chancellor told cabinet colleagues last week that the government could seek retribution after Brussels proposed banning British companies from sensitive parts of the project.

The move comes as Downing Street confirmed that Britain would seek to launch its own satellite navigation system by the mid\-2020s, as revealed by the Financial Times, should the European Commission maintain its stance.

The idea of preventing the transfer of technology and expertise relating to Galileo from the UK to the EU is now being developed in Whitehall. Ministers have been told this could add €1bn to the costs of the sophisticated navigation system, which has multiple civilian and military uses.

It comes after the EU offered a contract to CGI UK to transfer to Thales of France its expertise in the cryptography protecting Galileo’s highly secure navigation arrangement for government users, called the Public Regulated Service.

CGI is the largest supplier of security systems for the Galileo programme but, under current rules, the public regulated service can be accessed only by EU member states.

British officials admit that they cannot legally prevent CGI UK from selling its technology to the EU. However, London was looking at what work could be offered to keep the expertise in Britain if CGI decided not to take the contract with the bloc involving Thales. This could include involvement in the proposed domestic satellite navigation system.

“We could not draw up a legal contract saying they could not do the work in France or for the EU — it would have to be a gentleman’s agreement,” said one official briefed on the plan.

CGI had not yet decided to take the contract, said another official. “It is up to CGI what contract they take,” he added. “But there are discussions about whether there is any other work we could do in the UK to retain that expertise.”

CGI UK declined to comment.

Greg Clark, the business secretary, warned the EU internal market commissioner, Elzbieta Bienkowska, last week that a removal of British encryption technology could delay the Galileo project by at least three years.

The European Commission’s claim that Britain cannot be trusted with sensitive material related to Galileo after Brexit has infuriated London, which believes the proposed ban on UK companies is naked protectionism intended to help their French rivals.

“Philip Hammond was very annoyed,” said one official briefed on Mr Hammond’s intervention at prime minister Theresa May’s inner Brexit cabinet committee last week.

“He said it was ironic that EU finance ministers were angry that the US was introducing steel tariffs on national security grounds but they were prepared to countenance this with Galileo.”

CGI, with headquarters in Canada, has been working with the European Space Agency almost since its foundation in 1975. It has operations in a number of EU countries including Germany, the Netherlands and Italy.

The company has already transferred some work from the UK to operations in the Netherlands to ensure it will be considered in the bidding for work on the highly sensitive ground control segment of Galileo, according to British officials.

Airbus, which has lead responsibility for Galileo’s ground control operations, has made a commitment to ensure that all work is done from EU member states by the time the UK leaves the bloc.

Senior UK industry executives said the British government’s offer of a “gentleman’s agreement” would not be sufficient to persuade any company to withdraw from working with the EU on space projects.

But Downing Street will try to persuade UK companies to dedicate their technology to developing a “British global navigation satellite system”, which it claimed on Tuesday could be launched by the mid\-2020s. “We want full access to Galileo, including the crucial secure elements that will help guide British missiles should they be needed to keep us all safe,” said a Downing Street official. “If we don’t get access, we will find an alternative.”

Mr Clark and Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, have been looking at whether Britain could develop its own satellite navigation system, although the cost of such a project — particularly when the defence budget is already strained — is a big obstacle.",Éire,/r/europe/comments/8gfnlk/annoyed_hammond_seeks_to_sabotage_galileo/dybb6z0/,gamberro,1525247184

Many Macedonian musicians made purely music in Serbian language if they had any hope to be successful and strictly Macedonian musicians were avoided even by the majority of Macedonian youth. Macedonian motives were left behind. In this same period we see a rise in the church\-metal music group 'Mizar', who were a hit with his younger generation. They make absolutely astonishing music which is \(and was\) a mix of Old Church Slavic and Rock/Metal. 

About Serbian assimilation in Macedonia

I've heard, from the same man, that discussion of Serbian assimilation of Macedonians in the Vardar Macedonia region after the First Balkan War was prohibited and avoided at all cost.

2447,"The story says: ""Police in Paris have arrested nearly 200 masked demonstrators who smashed shop windows and torched cars during annual May Day protests.

Far-left anarchist groups, known as Black Blocs, hijacked a peaceful rally against President Emmanuel Macron's public sector labour reforms.

Police said about 1,200 masked and hooded protesters attended the annual 1 May demonstration by labour unions.

Four people, including a police officer, were lightly wounded.

The protesters were swamped with teargas and sprayed with a water cannon in an effort to disperse them.

The black-clad protesters attempted to hold up the demonstration march, before smashing shop windows along the route and torching a McDonald's near Austerlitz station.

Various vehicles and a car dealership were also set ablaze, and graffiti was scrawled on walls.

Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux criticised the protesters for covering their faces.

""When you have sincere convictions, you demonstrate with your face unmasked,"" he said. ""Those who wear hoods are the enemies of democracy.""

There is widespread discontent in labour unions over Mr Macron's reforms. Rail staff have begun three months of nationwide strikes over a planned overhaul of state-run railway SNCF.

Tens of thousands of teachers, nurses and other workers joined the rail staff on strike in March. The president has said he will not back down on his agenda.

Unions said the number of peaceful protesters at the main demonstration on Tuesday was about 55,000. Police put the number lower, at about 20,000.

The protest was small compared with the 223,000 people who turned out in Paris in September to protest against the planned reforms.",,/r/europe/comments/8gf31b/paris_police_arrest_200_in_may_day_riots/dyb7pdp/,rambo12122,1525240302

2500,"&gt;It is no surprise to see the EU dominate the US in rail.  It should also be noted that US rail is used predominantly for freight so much so that one could state that it is almost exclusively used for freight, whereas in the EU rail is used predominantly for passenger use.  What is surprising though is the scale of the difference, Luxembourg has over three times the rail coverage of Illinois which is the US state with the highest rail coverage.
&gt;
&gt;The number of miles of railway per square mile of land for the European Union as a whole is 0.12 (0.07 km per square km) which ranks it just below Illinois (the highest ranked US state) and just above Slovakia (the numbers in the chart are rounded to the nearest hundredth).  The number of miles of railway per square mile of land for the United States as a whole is 0.04 (0.02 km per square km) which ranks it just below Michigan and just above Greece (the lowest ranking EU state).  So the EU as a whole has a rail coverage similar to the US state with the greatest coverage and the US as a whole has a rail coverage similar to the EU state with the least coverage.

So the EU has three times the rail density of the US.  Let's check Wikipedia for population density.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_European_Union

&gt;118.3 people per square kilometer

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States

&gt;32.8 people per square kilometer

So the EU has 3.6 times the population density of the US.

&gt;From 1988 to 1992, she worked as an assistant physician at the Women's Clinic of the Hanover Medical School. Upon completing her postgraduate studies, she graduated as a &gt;Doctor of Medicine in 1991.

&gt;Ursula von der Leyen was elected to the Parliament of Lower Saxony in the 2003 state election, and from 2003 to 2005 she was a minister in the state government of Lower Saxony, serving in the cabinet of Christian Wulff, with responsibility for social affairs, women, family, and health.
&gt;
&gt;In 2003, von der Leyen was part of a group assigned by then-opposition leader and CDU chairwoman Angela Merkel to draft alternative proposals for social welfare reform in response to Chancellor Gerhard Schröder’s ""Agenda 2010"". The so-called Herzog Commission, named after its chairman, the former German President Roman Herzog, recommended a comprehensive package of reform proposals including, among other things, decoupling health and nursing care premiums from people’s earnings and levying a monthly lump sum across the board instead.[15]

I suspect that routed more money to poor mothers.

2633,"&gt; You're not saying the whole story

&gt; The Slovak nation and people had been poorly defined up to this point, as the Slovak people lacked a definitive border or national identity. However, in the years leading up to the revolution, the Hungarians had taken steps to Magyarize the Slovak region under Hungarian control.
...
You left out important part of your cited source. The Slovak identity was not as collective and well defined as you implied it. Furthermore  a Hungarian or Slovak identity not always matched with actual ethnic background. If you thoroughly take a glance on the ethnic composition of key figures fighting in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 you will see a lot of similar ambiguity, which is no wonder because in mixed areas non-Magyars supported the revolution.  

Some people did not mind Magyar influence, some non-Magyars were even supportive of it.

 Sandor Petofi a revolutionary of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 had Slovak origins still refused the invitation of Slovak nationalists, because he unconditionally thought of himself as a Hungarian and believed embracing this identity and culture could make Hungary strong and progressive.

The ~~Hapsburg~~ Habsburg monarchy did not look for friends, if that was the case they would have honored the minorities for their effort. They looked for allies(!), and since they could not solve their problem through the minorities, the minorities political capital evaporated.

&gt; &gt; nationalism was on the rise all across Europe, we had a good reason to believe they would want to secede one day.

&gt; This is putting the ox before the cart.

It was a scenario that had chance to happen. They indeed could not predict it for sure, regardless history verifies them being right. 

I would use a different argument:

nationalism was on the rise all across Europe, we had a good reason to believe it was not only the nationalistic sentiment, but the logic of the time as well to go with the magyarization policy as that was what the most progressive model dictated to be beneficial for the economy. If you take for example the most progressive parts of Europe UK, France and even Spain all of them imposed these policies for the same reason.

&gt;  **Also, isn't is funny that you're basically claiming that only Hungarians should assimilate other nations?**

This is pure chauvinism. It is not the fault of 2nd, 3rd or 4th and so on generations' of people what their ancestors did. In addition the time when forced magyarization happened was the era of nationalism and the peak of it. It happened to be the Hungarians were in position to impose rule over Hungary at that time. It was nothing but expected regulations were nationalistic as like I said both the sentiment and the economic model dictated so to be it. However once that was over it was the world of Wilson's fourteen points and human rights which made any sort of nationalist motivated revenge unjustified. But let's not get so far from Romanians, the Decree of Alba Iulia right in 1918 promised *Full national freedom for all the co-inhabiting peoples.* 

Too bad it has not been kept ever since.

2634,"&gt;look, USA supports Nazis.

I mean, that was true post war. Nazis were necessary in the view of the American leadership because they were pretty effective anticommunists that could be 100% trusted to keep the communists in check, unlike middle of the road politicians who may or may not have harboured communist sympathies. The vast majority of the West German leadership were former Nazis, unlike in East Germany. 

The Americans were very soft during the Nuremberg Trials and the Japanese escaped the war with quite minor legal repercussions as well. Their Emperor, Hirohito and  Asaka, the prince and general in charge of the troops who brutalised Nanjing totally escaped scot-free, whereas a different general who had no real direct control over the troops and was sick during the Rape of Nanjing got charged. Farce. Unit 731, also got off, despite the dubious value of their so-called 'research'.

2669,"Yugoslavia is so relevant today. I think the concept of it is excellent on paper - every member was so small, and those small states working together to be safer and more prosperous than they would perhaps have been on their own was a noble goal. It just... didn't quite work, and its self-destruction should serve as a warning to all of us about multi-ethnic states, and attempts to create multinational nationalism. The former Yugoslav states are still a mess today due to how integrated they were when they shared a country, and it's hard to see the issue ever really going away. It's also hard to see the number of countries in the region not growing by the end of the century.

As someone who feels very passionately about Europe, I think it's so important to pay attention to how Yugoslavia worked, and how it failed. I think the most important thing to note is that forming a country before a shared identity comes into existence is asking for trouble - a lot of EU federalists could do with realising that. I would love to share a country with my fellow EU citizens, but not until we can all trust each other to get along, and it's OK if that's never the case.

Anyway, more on-topic, I am watching a documentary about the breakup right now and it's so depressing. I don't know why a peaceful split wasn't possible, but the nightmares that unfolded were so unnecessary, and I feel awful for the people of every former Yugoslav state that their people and their countries went through that. I hope someday that the scars will heal, and that every former member will reach the prosperity that they deserve. When I look at European economic data, it feels like such an injustice to see the struggles of the former Yugoslavia versus even the former Soviet states.

2733,"&gt; Canada cannot be seen as a best case scenario as their economy is no match for the uk at all. We’re number five.

Well the only thing better is either EEA membership (soft Brexit) or full on EU membership. Both vastly superior but not desired by the UK. Hence, a free trade agreement and the style of the Canadian one is currently the cream of the crop. Maybe there will be differences in a few areas but you will never get the quality of trade that an EEA or EU member has while not being part of said organisations. Which is obvious and was even acknowledged by your very own government several times.

&gt; You say a lot easier to buffer economic shocks, but I wonder how other nations would like that. Less income for some and more outgoings for others, it’s not going to sit well overall, at all.

Of course noone will like it but hasnt been our choice whether or not Brexit happens. It was up to the British people and then the elected government (twice by now) to decide whether or not to leave and how (soft or hard Brexit). So obviously the UK budget contributions are coming to an end once they're out. Nothing the rest of the EU can do about that though. 
But since the new post 2020 buget is coming up soon anyhow monetary comittments and expenses were up for renegotiation anyhow. This just makes it an even bigger than it already was going to be. Not ideal of course but politics rarely is. And EU politics anyways unfortunately.

&gt; There will be some companies moving, but the Uk is the financial hub, and many other industries like car making have already committed to increase investment, so in the bigger picture I’m positive the Uk would be fine

That I agree with - conditional on there being some post membership settlement of course. Otherwise all bets are of and noone quite knows how things will play out. London will still be one of the worlds financial hubs even if it looses some business to continental Europe. Over the long-term its growth might be affected but thats one of the better problems to have in the first place.

&gt;  the way the EU with barnier, verhofsdat, and juncker seem to want to punish the British for our decision, I just think Fuck them, they’re cunts.

I understand that English tends to borrow words from other languages by spelling rather than pronunciation, though I don't know other languages to try and check for percentage of phonetic loanwords.  The upside is that the word at least gets spelled right.  But in Czechia's case, neither the new nor old name is a phonetic copy or spelling copy of the original.

True, the ""-ia"" suffix *often* is used with countries.

Speaking of which, how come North America doesjt require a political union in order to prevent wars amongst themselves, or south America or East Asia? Japan and Taiwan aren't going to fight again just because they lack a supranational parliament. Argentina and Chile haven't fought each other and Merosul is nowhere near as big as the EU in terms of power and influence. Germany and France haven't had a war because the USSR and USA wouldn't have allowed them to and because they both recognized there was nothing to gain from further war, Germany was thoroughly beaten for the second time and the French had no further qualms with Germany. So no, nobody in Poland thought ""hey let's join the EU because France and Germany are maniacs who can't not kill each other without it"", they joined the EU because it benefits the polish people, it helps their economy, it gives them a boost in the international stage and it protects them from unfair deals with China or Russian aggression. Joining the EU isn't a feel good decision, it's a pragmatic choice, hence why Norway didn't join and why Iceland withdrew their application. Are Norway and Iceland going to disrupt Europe and cause a war now?

Britain wasn't concerned with Europe? Have you read any history books per chance? Remember the time 700,000 Brits plus 100,000+ of our commonwealth cousins died fighting because we had signed a treaty promising to protect Belgium? We went to war over a scrap of paper signed more than half a decade before WW1. Perhaps it would have been better to not get involved, but if we did that I bet you Belgians would still be bitching about how they were betrayed. Goody, so either we lost hundreds of thousands of our lads or get called perfidious forever. Not to mention we went to war again over Poland and got fuck all from it; became a bombed out, bankrupt, vassal to America and now constantly have to hear the mainland complain about how Brexit is the greatest betrayal of all time. Maybe not caring about Europe would have been the wiser decision given that getting involved in it hasn't ended well for us the last two times. 


No shit the empire doesnt exist? Here's a newsflash for you: nobody who voted for Brexit did so in hopes of invading India and Africa. People in this sub with non UK flairs bring up the Empire more than anyone else in the UK I swear to God. I dont support Brexit either, but I dont see why you people who don't even live here are acting so bitter and scorned about it. You would think the UK declared that we'd nuke Brussels and partion Poland with Russia the way you people act. Always bitched about how the UK was holding everything back, now that the UK is leaving you act offended and throw fits about how this will disrupt stability in Europe. If we are so irrelevant and puny then surely this won't be an issue? If you hate us so much for holding back your precious superstate why act like a scorned lover over Brexit?

My guess is that it was seen as easier to block on the European side than the US, for any number of reasons, not the least of which being that the EU's veto structure makes it way easier to kill trade agreements.

2856,"Most of the things you mentioned above actually improved your quality of life. I live in a post communist state as well so I can attest to most benefiting traits.

The Euro is the first valute that actuallu stays stable before it our countries currency kept inflating at a such rate it was worthless.

Multiculturism brought tourism and a huge revenue for its citizens. It actually envelops more than a third of all jobs in our capital city. It also allows us to study or work abroad thus giving us better chances at life.

The common army would help us as well since most smaller countries have an abysmal army size even though they occupy strategic positions. Like the Baltic states, Greece etc.

The common budget allows to finance growth in poorer regions so they develop faster to reach the levels of the bigger states. Even some larger countries have parts that need these funds like Spain, Italy and even some tpwns in France (france is too centralized arpund Paris) I can't count how many stuff got funded in my country by the EU. From highways that benefit other countries as well, to schools and parks. Heck even the college i visit was built by EU funds. 

Most of the money that countries give to the EU fund is given back to the same countries as projects and benefits. Its just like a carefully managed fund so that it get fairly shared and much more efficient.

The common law also instated better worker and consumer laws. We benefit from better food quality, pharmaceutical drug quality, electronics, etc. The laws also curtailed corruption due to the economic rules and the fiscal rule.

And you do have control over EU politicians. Each state even has a leadership mandate. And you have EU parliament elections. You did vote right? The EU parliament parties have members from each country as well. In my experience we have less control over local politicians due to corruption. Like Hungarian Orban or other far right parties that actually change their countries constitutions to benefit them.

2878,"Oh Rome, Ancient Rome. What is Rome? Rome, as a city, brings nothing but shame to Italy on the international stage. When comparing Rome with other European capitals such as London, Paris, Madrid and Amsterdam, any decent human’s face must blush in humiliation. Even small countries like Austria, Belgium, or Switzerland have Vienna, Brussels, and Zurich: presentable cities, complete with high standards of living. Italy gets punished with Rome; capital of losers. In all the republic, Rome is home to the largest number of good-for-nothing by far. Palazzo Madama, Montecitorio, Palazzo di Giustizia, Palazzo Senatorio are but a few examples of all the incompetent scum being kept here. Glorious ancient times have long since passed, the city is face down in the dirt. Romans are lazy sods to their very core. Traits that would, in any civilised culture, pass for nothing but laziness, rudeness, incompetence, dissocial personality disorder, or idiocy, are taken by the Roman and declared a way of life. That is why the Roman harbours intense feelings of hatred for anyone who’s better than him in any way. Especially the all-around superior Northern Italians are a thorn in his side. He envies their success, and Milan makes the top on his list of hatred. That city is – and has! – everything that Rome wants to be and have. Romans take no interest in the fact that it is Milan that finances their dissolute lifestyle, in fact, they secretly believe that they have earned it. So, instead of freeing themselves from their envious and resentful lethargy, instead of rolling up their sleeves and improve their city, they revel in their antisocial freeloading and praise their so-called eternal city. Culturally, Romans are set up rather weakly: great works lie far back in history. Not pronouncing the last syllable of every word is considered a great cultural feat. Advanced students have mastered ending each and every sentence with a “zi”. The city’s culinary performance is second-rate. Here, some pasta mixed with low quality cheese and pepper, “cacio e pepe”, is sold as a culinary masterpiece. Hardly any reasonable person would consider pepper and cheese a recipe, let alone the holy grail of culinary arts. Yet, in their magnanimity, the rest of the republic lets the Roman keep his delusion, not wanting to amplify his inferiority complex. Economically, Rome is an utter disaster, even after being sacked in 1527 Medieval Rome stood on more solid ground that it does today. The local economy is based around cocaine, something-something-media and, if universities are to be believed, communication studies. Disregarding his own bankruptcy, the Roman treats himself to prestigious projects like the C metro line and La Città dello Sport di Tor Vergata – which, considering their inoperative nature, are art installations. Moreover, the city houses all popular parties’ headquarters, who refrain from using “traitors” in their official names (probably for marketing reasons). For the longest time, this “city’s” “mayors”  butchered anything they found left in a presentable state. Long story short: Rome is Italy’s tiled coffee table. It is to Italy what Greece is to the European Union, and, if it had more open sewerages, it would be Italy’s Romania. Rome is a blemish, the abscess on the arse of the nation. Rome is the uninvited party guest, who didn’t even bring any booze and wouldn’t even understand he’s not welcome if he had is teeth beaten out and got thrown down the stairs.

&gt;V roku 1918 sa na vlne celouhorských štrajkov zviditeľnil Šrobár. Za prvomájové vystúpenie v Liptovskom Mikuláši, kde sa nejednoznačne vyjadril za samourčovacie právo pre uhorskú vetvu československého kmeňa, teda za pravdepodobný odchod Sovákov z Uhorska, si vyslúžil väzenie.

&gt;Šrobár mal vďaka svojmu aktívnemu prístupu veľkú zásluhu na tom, že sa slovenská politická scéna vyslovila za vytvorenie spoločného štátu s Čechmi. K tejto alternatíve sa na tajnej porade v máji priklonila Slovenská národná strana spolu s Andrejom Hlinkom, hoci ešte v lete predsa rokovala s uhorskou vládou o možnosti ústupkov zo strany Budapešti.

&gt;V septembri 1918 sa slovenskí politici rozhodli vytvoriť Slovenskú národnú radu ako najvyšší politický orgán Slovákov. V polovici októbra Juriga v uhorskom parlamente vyhlásil, že Slováci vytvorili vlastnú národnú radu, ktorá bude rozhodovať o ich osude.

Quick translation: 1918 the whole of Hungary is caught in protests and strikes. On May 1st, Šrobár called on a mass protest actions in Liptovsky Mikuláš for self-determination of Slovaks. For this he was arrested and imprisoned.

Slovak National Party after this decides to abandon attempt to continue negotiating with the Hungarian government and moves to support Šrobár 

September 1918 Slovak politicians create the Slovak National Council as the highest political organization of Slovaks, In October Juriga informs the Hungarian parliament that Slovaks now have their own council that will decide the future of Slovaks

&gt;Dňa 28. októbra 1918 vyhlásil v Prahe Národný výbor, ktorého členom bol aj Šrobár, vznik československého štátu.

&gt;Správa o vyhlásení nového štátu z Prahy na Slovensko ešte nedorazila, keď 30. októbra zasadla v Martine Slovenská národná rada a prijala Deklaráciu slovenského národa. Slovensko sa tým prihlásilo k novej republike. Tak sa vlastne stalo, že nový štát takmer naraz vyhlásili nezávisle od seba v Prahe a Martine.

28 October 1918 in Prague is declared the estabilishment of Czechoslovakia. Šrobár was among them.

The news of this act have yet to arrive in Slovakia, when in 30 October in Martin the Slovak National Council declared its union with Czechoslovakia. In effect, Czechoslovakia was declared at two places separately, in Martin and Prague.

&gt;Po prijatí martinskej deklarácie sa po Slovensku konali ľudové zhromaždenia, kde sa hlásili k deklarácii a prijímali slovenčinu do úradov. Výtlačky deklarácie sa vyvesovali na verejné miesta. Medvecký uvádza príklady viacerých miest a dedín, napríklad Ružomberka, Trenčína, Nového Mesta nad Váhom, Kremnice, Prešova. Väčšinou išlo o obce na severnom a západnom Slovensku.

After the Martin Declaration, mass demonstration happened in Slovakia, where common people proclaimed their allegiance to the declaration, and administrative offices were being Slovakized. Text of the declaration was being spread in cities on public places. Among them Ružomberok, Trenčín, Nové Mesto nad Váhom, Kremnica, Prešov. Most of them in western Slovakia

2999,"Alright, let's go back to 1918.

Serbia is on the side of the victors in WWI, though with tremendous human losses. Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia are on the side of the losers. The outside forces don't care about what we losers want, so they decided to do a lot of Trianon-equivalents to us.

At that point, we (western Yugos) rush to unconditionally unite with Serbia. The unconditional bit is there because we're really pressed for time, but also because of some misunderstood pan-Slavic signals during the decades prior (plus add romantic idealism). And in a cold-blooded *practical* sense it makes sense: we get to stay whole, Serbia gets to unite its huge scattered diaspora in one country with minimal losses. Also, there's the argument about ""safety in numbers, bigger is stronger"", an important consideration when you're surrounded by imperialists.

This is where the good news and the pros end, it's all downhill from here...

The most important and unsolvable problem is the de/centralization issue. Obviously Belgrade wants more power for itself, while the rest want less power to Belgrade. That goes on from the beginning to the end.

The economic arguments are also rotten. It's less like West and East Germany uniting, and more like... say, Poland and Ukraine. Poland - Slovenia, Croatia, Vojvodina (North Serbia) - is richer than Ukraine (the rest), so it only makes sense that they invest extra money into the poorer parts - EU works by same design. *However*, this particular Poland is nowhere rich enough to successfully invest into anyone, scarce money gets spread too thin, the rich(er) feel they're giving too much, the poor(er) that they not getting enough.

Add the lack of successful Yugoslav identity and loyalty (it's kinda like the pan-European stuff today), add outside pressures (WWII, Cold War ending), add some really childish/rotten politicians getting into power at the worst time, and that's it.

Subjectively, Slovak sounds softer and more melodic; aesthetically it is definitely the more pleasant-sounding language.

&gt; Brevísima relación de la destrucción de las Indias

*The book has been critiqued for centuries for its reliability about the treatment of the indigenous people and the number of indigenous people who died as a result of the mistreatment by the Spanish conquistadors. It was written to persuade the Spanish king to act in response to the Spanish conquistadors' abuse of the indigenous population. As a primarily persuasive text, many critics argue that facts and figures about the mistreatment and death toll were exaggerated, making the text largely unreliable.*

Apart from Algeria and Indochina, France had mostly decolonized peacefully by mutual consent by 1961, and in doing so managed to retain closer ties.

As an interesting comparison, especially given it's focus on language as the common factor rather than empire, consider the that the closest French equivalent of the Commonwealth, the [Organisation internationale de la Francophonie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_internationale_de_la_Francophonie) was started by former colonies mostly in Africa + Cambodia, rather than as a club for holding on to remnants of the empire.

3254,"&gt; French influence is a two-sided coin though as France is clinging tightly to Francophone countries in order to keep the language relevant.

I just posted about la Francophonie in another comment, pointing out that in fact it's the other way around: Unlike the UK, which created the Commonwealth to cling to some degree of relevance with the former Empire, in France's case the creation of la Francophonie was driven by former colonies - particularly Senegal, Tunisia and Cambodia, with part of their agenda being to push for France to remain more engaged.

Which I guess ties into your disappointment: France was much more prepared to let go, for both good and bad. But at the same time they have also remained more involved where wanted. The French involvement in the Sahel is substantially greater than what the UK is doing in its former colonies for example. But of course in terms of relative economic power, you're right the US certainly provides more opportunities.

&gt;When you enter a Polish household, it is customary to remove your shoes at the door.

Some Polish people bring a pair of their own slippers with them so they don’t have to deal with the situation. 

Another bizarre Polish custom is, after accepting the used slippers, requesting to wear a pair of unwashed trousers from the man of the house.

3290,"The ""replace X with Y""-argument is just the worst ever, yet it's so common. It's an argument only based on pathos and plays on the readers associations with words that are not even related. 

A rebellion is not by default evil. A slave rebellion is reasonable, and perhaps a particular group of slaves choose to rally under the slogan ""slaves, unite against the masters!"" That's fair.

because it is about the amount of tariffs you pay as a percentage of the total trade volume.

let's say product A &amp; B, are tariffed in both countries C &amp; D for both sides as 20% and 30% respectively. (for simplification we assume both products cost 100$)

It might seem fair since it is the same tariff for both countries, but then C exports to D 100 of A and 200 B(total 30 000$) and D exports to C 300 of A and 50 of B(total 35 000$).

now C pays (20\*100) + (30\*200) = 8 000$ on 30 000$(or about 26.7% effective tariffs) in tariffs while D pays (20\*300)+(30\*50) = 7 500$ on 35 000$.(or about 21.4% effective tariffs)

3415,"That sort of information is hard to get, if they make a note of it at all, and ""bicycle-"" or ""car"" death refers to the vehicle they are using, not the location.     
*A cyclist getting hit by a 200 km/h sports-car on the autobahn is a bicycle death.*    
    
Some incidents/accidents happen because they are simply too old/feeble, they topple over at 0 km/h and break their hip when trying to get on the (heavier than expected) e-bike at the start of the journey.    

80^(+) brains work slow and can't multi-task (-ish), complex situations like '4 directions are green' are(could be) confusing (given the time required/available), (reaction time-) braking is slower and the higher weight/speed increases the distance, causing them to bump into other cyclists or come to a stop not before a (car) crossing but in front of those cars, whatever.     
    
Most bicycle deaths I assume involve a car, the 'Fietsersbond' recommends lowering the (car)speed-limit to 30 km/h in (parts of) city centres where cars/bicycles mix and use the same roads (car driver's brains are slow as well), and some crossings are simply dangerous and need re-designing.    
The [dead corner](http://www.lokalepolitie.be/sites/5410/images/fiets-vrachtwagen.jpg) is well known, IF it is the same road surface then cyclists might remember it, if it is a separate bicycle path they will feel safe and probably don't think of that.    
The same happens on (busy) [roundabouts](https://www.anwb.nl/binaries/content/gallery/anwb/portal/verkeer/veiligheid/rotonde2.jpg/rotonde2.jpg/anwb%3Aw760) where cyclists are in the dead corner of cars leaving the roundabout (the car driver has to look *back* over his shoulder while manipulating the steering wheel), a [different setup](https://www.anwb.nl/binaries/w440/content/gallery/anwb/portal/verkeer/veiligheid/rotonde1.jpg) allows car drivers unhindered cornering and presents crossing cyclists through the *front* window.    
 
What most people agree on is de-tuning the ebike to 18 km/h or less when needed, the (legal) problem for the bike-shops is they can't do that without authorisation of sorts, that's basically up to the elderly's children to convince mum/dad to take it easy, until 'the law' requires a yearly 'speed-limit' suitability test.    
     
Edit: those 200 deaths have to be balanced against the health benefit for the 1.000.000 elderly that are capable of some outdoors-y activity with some e-bike help.

To me personally the appropriate conservative approach to such an issue is taking it slowly. The status quo is being a member of the EU after all.

&gt; I wish those labels would go away on this oft-reposted map. To clarify, those labels have no scientific meaning. They are what the original creator of the map assigned as ethnic labels to haplogroups, but are just plain misleading as haplogroups are haplogroups and nothing else.
&gt; 
&gt; For example I’ve seen this map used to argue “Poland is more Aryan than Germany”, which makes no sense as the R1a haplogroup isn’t an Aryan haplogroup, it’s just the R1a haplogroup. Interestingly enough, the R1a haplogroup is found primarily around the Proto-Indo-European homeland and in India, so in the case of that particular haplogroup there is a definite correspondence between descendants of Indo-Europeans and the haplogroup.

3589,"&gt; As I have pointed out to you, other countries break the EU rules as well. Germany is the master in that with the most infrigement against it.

And there is a HUGE difference in that. Germany not agreeing with the use of a coolant in cars and other minor infrigements are NOT the same as some EE countries rejecting core principles of the EU. And, sorry to tell you but the one who pays the music box decides what song is played. The whole EU is a project, and those who work FOR the project should get more money, those who work AGAINST the project should get less money. You equal law infridgements with rejecting the principles of the EU. This is not the same. 

&gt; So no, it's not that I don't understand your point, it's simply that I don't agree with it. You cherry-pick things that you had to give, while ignoring everything that we had to give.

What is ""everything we had to give""? The things you had to give have mainly to do with capitalism, not with the EU. Don't mix those things up. 

Refusing to help Southern European countries by accepting migrants is more than just an infridgement, it is rejecting European solidarity, it is not accepting the principles the EU is based on. If you reject the principles, why should other countries keep to them?

&gt; You can't just selectively punish EE countries, because from your perspective we should do exactly what you tell us and if that doesn't happen we are ungrateful shits.

basically yes, we can and we must if we believe in the idea of the EU and if we want the EU to have a future. EE countries joined the EU, not the EU joined a country in EE, so the rules and principles of the EU are relevant. If there is a difference, EE countries must change, not the EU. And yes, that means accepting things you don't like, just as every single one of the countries in the EU has things they don't like. And there is a lot people in Spain, Italy, Germany and France don't like about the EU. Yet all those countries stand for the core principles of the EU and actively work FOR it. Just the EE countries work against it wherever they can and this cannot be unpunished. 

&gt; The budget still has to be approved unanimously so you will need our support to pass it. And we will obviously not support something that villifies us.

The budget means that Germany will have to give money. Especially with the British part falling away, there will be discussions about financing, and a part of Merkel's party has already announced that they are not willing to pay more into the Eu budget. This means that EE countries will get less automatically. And EE countries are not exactly in a position to demand anything in those negotiations, because if Germany refuses to give money, there is no budget. If we have no budget, EE countries will get no funding at all. ",,/r/europe/comments/8g0uus/eastern_eu_states_feel_ridiculed_by_commission/dy9a74i/,ziemen,1525161089

If anyone _really_ wants to do it right, they'd have to first accept a few realities of the situation. I will try to talk about them a bit. First, the enemies:

- Having rich, strong, influential, wealthy countries outside of France and Germany goes against the interests of the current political class in France and Germany. They are not going to help a bit and will probably try to prevent this from happening. (Note: when I say ""political class"" I do mean the people who get to make decisions; but of course, in ""old democracies"" the few very rich people of the country have a very strong influence over the politicians and their decisions.)

- The current leaders of many countries are crooks. They are also business associates with proper crooks. Would any law or human decency be upheld, they'd have to give up most of what they've got and go to jail or exile. They are probably very willing to get people killed before they face justice.

Then, about the whole democracy thing:

- People are dumb idiots, cattle. Some are too stupid to understand that if everyone is better off, they will be better off too: all they want is that they are doing better than the people they see day-to-day. Others are mortally afraid of change and would give everything to have things ""as they were"". If you want to be elected in a popular vote, you'd have to make these idiots vote for you.

- People are also uneducated. I don't mean having an engineering or medical degree. This is useless when it comes to understanding how a society works, how democracy works, what a citizen can or must do. Very few people I know have any respect for _that_ kind of education or knowledge. So you'd have to educate people, little by little, somehow.

To get it done, one would have to dedicate years, probably decades of their life to it, when all odds are against them and failure is almost certain. They would have to be ready to pay with their life for it, especially if there is any chance of succeeding.

Now, step-by-step plan:

1. Become rich and successful.
2. Use your money to acquire enough media exposure, to become popular.
3. Whenever something major happens, use your media exposure to talk about it, addressing the lowest common denominator.
4. Use your popularity to acquire political positions, at least locally.

At this point this becomes a positive feedback loop. Of course, you'll have to make a lot of morally questionable decisions along the way, create a network of people who are loyal because they fear you, ruthlessly destroy any opposition....

No one is arguing with that, that's the point. Wikipedia can't replace your sctipt, when in most cases the script contains everything you need in the exams. You're acting all high and mighty because apparently you're avoiding Wikipedia as a matter of principle. Fine, do what you want, nobody gives a shit. 

&gt;Maybe speak for yourself?

What? I am speaking for myself, and for all people I know. No one is citing wikipedia, no professor would accept that.

&gt;I will give you an example of how shitty Wikipedia works. 

I fail to see your point. No one is arguing that Wikedia is flawless or a quality source of in-depth knowledge or anything. Yes there is some wrong info, yes we are all aware of the self-perpetuating bad source cycle as perfectly depicted in this [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/978/), it is well known to most people who are in a position to write a paper and need to use proper sources. I'm simply taking issue with your annoying digital finger pointing at everyone's face. Frankly it's kinda ridiculous and just makes you look like a fool. 

What is your point exactly? ""Don't use wikipedia, ever!"" ?

Well sorry dude, I am still going to use wikipedia when I want to know how many kids my favorite actress has or who she currently  sleeps with. It's pathethic but sometimes I just want to know. Wikipedia conveniently sums up all the relevant info, and if it really matters, I'll even follow the source to see which trashy lifestyle magazine they cited. 

As an 8th grader, when I had to do a presentation on some shit topic like some tiny Pacific Island or the history of bread or whatever, I essentially extracted 90% of the info from Wikipedia - and I'd fucking do it again if I had to.

3810,"The Columbus genocide meme is ridiculous and part of a growing discourse of anti-European hatred, in this case veiled as critique against a historical European.

It was inevitable that there would be contact between the old and new world sooner or later. If an Arab, African, Chinese, Russian, or simply another Italian would have discovered America instead there is zero reason to believe that historical outcomes would have been 
 in some way ""better"". It is just as likely they would have been worse.

Columbus discovery of an entirely new continent contributed immensely to science, to increased productivity, to trade and to cultural bonds between the old and new world.

He changed the world forever - against the odds and before anyone else. Of course that is a worth celebrating.

Disabled people and their care-takers (mainly mothers I believe) are protesting in the Sejm building (the lower house of the parliament). 
They desire higher social benefits. 
From what I’ve gathered, the money for those benefits was allocated earlier but it seems that it has *disappeared*. 

Meanwhile a Sejm committee has approved a legislation that will lower the salaries of the Sejm deputies. The opposition has abstained from voting on that legislation. 

One of the opposition leaders, Katarzyna Lubnauer, has said that the Sejm should take care of the ongoing protest first, rather than taking care of trifles like the Sejm deputies’ salaries. 
It’s worth noting that some time ago the ruling party has awarded bonuses for officials from various Ministries. 

and on a more lighthearted note; yesterday, #WarszawaJakiego was trending on Twitter in Poland. It’s ridiculing Patryk Jaki’s (a PiS politician who’s running for President of Warsaw) campaign video. He has claimed that he has a decent chance of winning the election against his main opponent - the PO candidate, Rafał Trzaskowski. 
Jaki’s campaign video featured a photo of Praga (the Czech capital) instead of Praga (a Warsaw district).

3911,"Under Ioticization, ι, ει, η, υ, υι, οι, are all pronounced exactly the same. It's way more annoying than just a few small exceptions. Practically most words require memorisation of what variety it falls under. For example, you have Αριστοτέλης (aristotles) which uses ι first and then η later for the same sound. Note μπορώ which means ""I can,"" which uses ο and then ώ for the exact same sound again. These are all really common words. 

I also forgot to mention that ε and αι make the same sound too. Great example of this is Τι γίνεται; which is a question that means ""what's up"" in Greek. If I wrote it as γίναιται or γίνετε it would functionally still be pronounced the exact same. 

So, it's probably not as bad as English orthography but it's underrated as far as confusion and difficulty to learn because of its lack of second language learners. 

If we're talking about Indo-European, Persian's writing system is terrible and unsuitable for the language, but I guess it's not bad given that it is using an abjad. Of course, Iran isn't a European nation so I guess it's technically out. 

[Danish is also similarly confusing in some ways](https://blogs.transparent.com/danish/2011/09/01/written-danish-a-couple-of-quirks/) Norwegian orthography follows two primary formats, one based more on common standards of pronunciation and the other based on Norway's historic ties. Swedish I've heard is similarly not very good regarding the correspondence between the written standard and spoken standard. So that adds up our list to English, French, Russian, Greek, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, (and Persian.) I'm sure there are others, especially with lesser spoken languages.

Nope, you implied this:

&gt;&gt;If you do not hate foreigners, you are mentally ill according to this individual. LOL.

This is your thought-process: if you like someone, you don't dislike them; if you dislike them, you don't like them. 

In other words, binary or tertiary thinking. That's it, that's the most you're capable of, thinking the opposite of xenophilia is xenophobia. ”LOL”.
 
&gt;Like when you called me a ''xenophiliac'' and a ''germanophiliac'' for not indulging in your feces throwing in president Iohannis, that you can't stand for being a german ethnic.

1) I didn't called you a ”xenophile”.                          
2) **You &amp; others like you are supporting an** ***antisemite***. **What's worse, you're taking pride in supporting and protecting an antisemite.**  But hey, apparently, I'm the one ”throwing feces”, huh...                                          
3) The german ethnic community organisation is the direct descendant of the previous nazi-supporting one. Pardon me for not indulging against a Nuremberg decision since the 90s when it was legalised; unlike germanophiles or germanophile nazis.

&gt;You can spam the mods as much as you like, reporting everyone that disagrees with you. I'm pretty sure they already got who they are dealing with.

When you're defaming &amp; disinforming about me, that's not a ”that disagree with” me.

On the other hand we take you seriously, that is Trump we don't take seriously, And I remind you that it was Trump that complained about Korea ""owning money"" to the US and wanting to scale back US presence there. That quite paradoxal with what you just said about China. Didn't heard Trump much about the South China Sea by the way.

As if Nato dies, I don't think we will have anything to explain since we left the integrated command for 35 years for instance. The one calling Nato ""obselete"" isn't in Europe and those calling for an european military initiative arn't in the US. But please do ask for it, I am personaly fine with it, it could even help in several ways.

But have fun finding someone doing what you whish even if you would be able to enunciate what you whish.

I will go further. If you think that removing yourselves from MENA or Africa or even Eastern Europe will be useful to counter acting China then you are the one with sights issues. Several countries has been in need of assistance in defense or investments. If you leave, those needs will not disappear and those countries will look for someone else. Look at Africa, what the US couldn't get it moved to prevent French or British interests to stay. Congratulations, Kenya main partner is now China!  Why do you think the US Foreign Department has partially stopped counter-acting French commercial activities along the African Golden Coast?

Wanna counter act China? Don't let a void where China could gain influence and market share. Don't buy made in China stuffs, ask your president why so many Trump ties are made in China, don't threaten Korea of removing US troops when Korea has a huge army that has been purchasing US weapons for decades, support VietNam when it needs it, I mean what the point of sending a US carrier in visit to show support against China a few weeks ago in a historic move since the war if it is to say nothing about the current China-VN relations?

What you don't understand is if you want to counter-act China you will need to counter it everywhere, from what you buy to what ally you choose or what country you let aside for China's influence to grow.

4028,"&gt; If you didn't think this was bad for the kids you would not be resistant to the idea of having an education system in both languages. We both know that you want a system exclusively in Catalan in order to further one culture over the other,

I already told you and you already know perfectly. Stop playing dumb and wasting your time: the absolute majority of linguists, philologists, politicians, teachers and parents support our linguistic education model. You and the other Spanish nationalists sectors that oppose to it represent a very fringe minority in Catalonia. And nobody support you because you don't have linguistic or scientific foundation behind your position.

Our Catalan linguistic education model is one of the few things that has immense support in Catalonia from everybody regarding their ideologies: right wing, left wing, pro-independence and unionists. The fact your position is very minority should make you think already. People (like me) have already showed you objective data proving how wrong you are. But you seem happy lying to yourself.

&gt; I really do suggest you look at a map of who recognized the separationof Catalonia (countries that did are in green) in order to get some perspective of how mistaken your views are.

Nobody can recognize something that simply doesn't exist. Catalonia is not independent. Catalan leaders didn't enforce independence, but asked for a negotiation with the Spanish government to find a solution. Catalan leaders were even open right after the referendum to hold another referendum (agreed with Spain) to close the issue once for all.

But I'm just gonna stop discussing with you. You are just out of reality. After all the bullshit you spread about our linguistic education model (praised over and over as a success model and obtaining one of the best results in Spain), I can only feel sad about you.

Nobody knows you as you know yourself, so it’s impossible to give you an advice which doesn’t just bear good intentions.

What leads to more safety is things like separate bicycle lanes, having clear rules and laws for every participant in traffic that all of those participating in traffic adhere to (which means enforcing traffic rules and educating traffic participants, which happens at a very young age already here).

Again, the very same could have solved the traffic safety issue with cars, ca. 120 years ago.

As for why migration shouldn't be a criterion - I already explained. It's not a matter of cohesion. Cohesion is a policy that all member countries agreed on, it's supposed to be bringing poorer countries/regions closer to richer countries. The priority can go from cohesion to security if that's found necessary, i.e. more funding from the overall budget would go to security which should help SE countries with protecting their borders. But it shouldn't be mixed with other priorities.

4426,"generally speaking, not a problem.  The children of immigrants end up fully integrated members of society. If they are born here of course they are citizens by birth, but even if they were brought here as children, once they start going to school they quickly acculturate.  Since these children usually end up bilingual and bi-cultural, they usually end up being the ones who help their parents' and grandparents' generations navigate the complexities and nuances of the host society, because older people have so much more difficult learning new languages and practices. If you go to any city office or hospital you'll see the 1st and 2nd generation children of immigrants acting as translators and communicators. For example, most doctors and nurses i know are fully bilingual or multi-lingual since most of them are themselves the adult children of immigrants. As another example, many immigrant-family owned businesses like restaurants have the teenaged and adult children working in the front as the servers because they can speak the language, while the parents work in the back as the chefs because they don't have to speak to customers in the kitchen.

Well, the Spanish settlers married locals and converted them. There was abuse and exploitation but it was more due to not being very able to control people so far from Spain.

Article 13 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) asserts that:

* a [citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen) of a state in which that citizen is present has the liberty to travel, reside in, and/or work in any part of the state where one pleases within the limits of respect for the liberty and rights of others,
* and that a citizen also has the right to leave any country, including his or her own, and to return to his or her country at any time.

In [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), in 1215, the right to travel was enshrined in Article 42 of the [Magna Carta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta):

It shall be lawful to any person, for the future, to go out of our kingdom, and to return, safely and securely, by land or by water, saving his allegiance to us, unless it be in time of war, for some short space, for the common good of the kingdom: excepting prisoners and outlaws, according to the laws of the land, and of the people of the nation at war against us, and Merchants who shall be treated as it is said above.

It's a human right that Europe has explicitly agreed to.

And meanwhile, Europe advocates for allowing refugees the freedom of movement all across Europe, into Europe, and out of Europe with no such restrictions as they are proposing for the UK. That's what's petty. They're upset that the UK is leaving.",,/r/europe/comments/8fe68e/facepalm/dy7m3bx/,terevos2,1525095669

4496,"I wouldn't disagree for the first part, but that hides that English has a weird learning curve: the fundamental blocks (apart from spelling) are pretty simple, but once you go beyond that it gets incredibly tricky. Off the top of my head:

* Prosodic stress: English stress operates on two distinct levels, mainly word-level and sentence- or phrase-level. Both ""Mike gave *me* the money"" and ""Mike gave me the *money*"" mean the same thing, but the location of stress adds a degree of nuance to it that's not readily obvious. Additionally, English loves to have divergent stress patterns (think ""*photo*graph"" vs ""pho*to*grapher"").

* Essentially duplicate vocabulary that includes words that are synonymous but have slightly difference nuances associated with them. Words with Germanic roots are typically simpler or more colloquial, whereas Latin-derived words are more formal.

* Adjectival word order. To a native, ""the big brown hairy bair"" is correct but not ""the brown big hairy bear"". There's actually a rule behind this but it's not usually ever taught.

* Derivation of nouns and verbs from each other. ""Interview"" is originally a noun but has become a verb. This leads to the broader point that a huge swath of words can not only have multiple meanings, but also be multiple parts of speech without any divergence in structure or morphology.",London,/r/europe/comments/8fyivt/if_yeah_ever_wondered_how_hard_is_to_learn_polish/dy7m4zl/,ldn6,1525095720

i do feel the same thing about the refugees.
we here in NL have about 60k of them, less than i thought, and i only want the weak, inferm, the handicapped, the gays and the azedi or christian minorities and children under the age of 12 to stay. which would be less than 30k
im not heartless.

the rest can fuck off.
its sad how you are comparing the situation of EE and that of actual refugees. one has it way better than others, and the others are actually fleeing for their lives.

but not the fake economic refugees. all of them can fuck off back, that includes EE.

and before you mention why other arab nations dont take in the refugees.
turkey has millions, lebanon has a million and some change.
tunisia has a couple of hunderd thousand and list goes on and on.
if it werent for those countries you and other EE would be bitching even harder.

but remember, no one is forcing EU countries to accept refugees.
they are sovereign and decide who stays and goes.
the EU never had and never will have the power to force any EU country to do such a thing.
there were quotas yes, but everyone agreed to them
as did Poland until they broke their promise and left us to fix the mess on our own while they continue to call us authoritarian while leeching off of us.
thats why im pissed at these EE countries.
not for not taking refugees per se, but for not sharing the collective burden with the rest of us.
we are supposed to be a union and should bear the fruits together as well as the hardships.

but EE countries want all the goodies without any of the work
and now on of the countries hit the hardest by the refugee crisis. Italy is lobbying hard for the EU to end funds for Poland and Hungary as payback for their backstabbing.

and i think NL and the rest of the west is going to back them up.
and i absolutely agree.
see, not everything is black and white.
but EE citizens have been conned by their backwards leaders, and it has cost them the support of the moderates in the west, and our right wingers still hate EE and think they are subhuman.

if any Hungarian or Pole thinks they are more welcome in a Le pen France than a muslim they are deadwrong.

&gt; The ""joke"" is entirely based on the dog's reaction. If the words are irrelevant for the dog, then the words are irrelevant for the joke.

No, the joke is based on the **combination** of its reaction and what it is reacting to. There is no joke in just a dog getting happy or just saying ""gas the Jews"", but there is when you combine the two. Go ask 10 people you know ""what is funnier"": 

* a dog getting happy/excited when you say something normal like ""who wants to go for a walk?""

* a dog getting happy/excited when you say something crude/rude/offensive like ""we're going to the vet to get your balls cut off"".

&gt; Choosing to say ""gas the Jews"" was deliberate although the choice was irrelevant because the dog would have reacted in the same way to any other words.

Yes, it was deliberate, the whole joke was about the absurdity of a cute dog geting excited when he hears the most horrendous/offensive shit, the dogs reaction would be the same no matter the words, but there would be no comedic effect if it was something normal.

&gt; Reciting antisemitic threats to a dog doesn't make for a joke. It's antisemitism because the dog's presence is irrelevant because dogs cannot understand English.

BS, its a joke, if a punchline to a joke is something like - ""... he doesnt even know Im going to kil him in his sleep"". That is not a threat, it is not a serious claim and should not be illegal. 

&gt; What's the funny part in ""gas the Jews""?

Nothing, as I said - its the combination of the words and reaction, not one or the other.

&gt; Saying it doesn't make it true. You have no arguments.

The court has ample arguments but you're dismissing them without even discussing them.

Quote it then and prove me wrong, saying its there doesnt make it true.

&gt; Saying that something is a ""joke"" doesn't take away your liability. The ""it's a joke, bro"" argument doesn't hold up in court.

So should joking about murder, rape and other horrible things be illegal? They are jokes, they are not serious claims or threats. 

&gt; You are ignoring the context of the video which doesn't make it a joke because the dog is being used as a prop and the dog is the only funny thing in the video.

No, you are the one who doesnt understand how jokes work. The whole context is - its a joke, not to be taken seriously.

This is false on pretty much all accounts.

If what you say is true, then the 2008 crisis either didn't happen or Greece made a full recovery and you're acting as if the crisis and the recovery never happened.

&gt; The policy is designed to put future Government's over the barrel (circumventing democracy) so creditors get their due.

You are using emotional triggers to win an argument without actually bringing any new information to the table. That's how propaganda works.

&gt; Common sense is running a deficit in scenarios like this to help the country actually recover.

You obviously have no idea about what you are talking. Read up on the Greek financial crisis.

The Greek government lied about Greece's debt levels and deficits. That's part of why the crisis hit them especially hard while every other country has recovered.

&gt; The EZ are playing the short term game on how can we get our money back in full ASAP, instead of showing any concern for sound economic policy.

Greece has received a very lenient payback schedule and the interests are historically low. Do you expect them to just take the money and never pay it back?

Again, without actual arguments and factual information, this is just fear mongering and false propaganda.

&gt; Around this time, TNK-BP faced a series of harassments, of a kind known in Russia as “administrative action.” Russian police raided TNK-BP’s offices in Moscow; an employee was arrested and accused of espionage. More than a hundred others had their visa status threatened, and BP pulled them out of the country. According to a U.S. Embassy cable released by WikiLeaks, TNK-BP’s C.E.O., Robert Dudley, sometimes came home at night and found papers on his kitchen table: legal summonses compelling him to appear at hearings far from Moscow, with only a few hours’ notice. Fearing that his office was bugged, Dudley passed notes with his colleagues to avoid being overheard. He began feeling ill. On a trip out of Russia, according to three people close to BP, he had his blood tested, and poison was found in his bloodstream. He stopped eating food provided by the company and began to feel better. Finally, one day in July, Dudley learned that the police were coming for him the next morning. He went out the back door of his apartment to a waiting car and left the country.

Further allegations of forging and foul play related to this degree were published.

After weeks of wrenching back and forth, including  legal threats against the journalists who were authoring these allegations, demands for her resignation, some actual legal proceedings, a 2011 video of Cifuentes being retained and having her purse searched in a supermarket under the suspicion of shoplifting was published by Okdiario - which has nothing to do with eldiario.es btw-.

Last chance fancy pants. We knew the war was coming, talked to some squinty eyed fuckos from the east if they would help, their condition was that it was only one war and not two so either England or Spain had to be warleader (or Inca but nvm), to ensure that Spain declared a war of aggression on Bavaria.

Now we still had a few years of truce with the muslims, of whom we were sure would enter one way or another. Wasn't really necessary as us Europeans were losing and the Asians couldn't reach us, still the Ottomans, Mamluks and Great Horde joined. Can't say much about the Asian threater as I was occupied on my own turf and helping out the English, which had to deal with Theodorian and probably other condottieris.

After an initial cautious push into German territory we suffered defeat after defeat, our state of the art forts with defensive preparations crumbled like mud huts. Their strongest troops were the Prussians, ours were mine which were on par with the Prussians, only problem: Venice and Lübeck were funding Prussia so it could field twice as many units.

It dawned on us that I was going to be out of the war very soon, so I wanted to give my armies some action before that happened to assist my allies as much as possible. After another defeat in France we marched into North Africa and annihilated the Mamlukean forces before accepting a peace offer where we ceded one province, not even a fortified one, and gave 700 ducats. However, soon thereafter Spain surrendered so I could have just stayed in the war and enjoy the longer truce. Lübeck and Theodoro also attacked England and our ally, the Netherlands, whom we helped out a bit, but with my truce timer running out I pulled back my army and consolidated.

The follow up war happened, Spain and England did not answer the call to arms, I urged my allies who did to offer white peace, Provence and Portugal were white peaced out, they wouldn't accept the Popes offer though. Still terrified from being crushed in Africa, the Mamlukes did not dare to join against me, that it matters.

This war shall be the one that breaks the camels back, there is no coming back after this one, and soon thereafter, the light of Christianity shall be snuffed out while our enemies shall revel in their degeneracy.

Also sound logic from the Germans. Western forces manage to win against the Muslims, the Muslims are not on friendly terms with the squint eyes or the New World, the Germans can tip the scales either way. 

&gt; it's easier to expand west than east

nevermind that the west beat the east and theres more land available in the east, but what can you expect from some degenerates.

4931,"&gt; Spain is likely to be one of the few countries where war criminals were never prosecuted

Those war criminals had the support of a significant part of the population, and of the army. For such a transition to succeed, preserving national unity is paramount.

Of course, many people would find it quite satisfying to have a Nuremberg style shitshow every time a dictatorship transitions to democracy. But if such a thing were true then there would simply be no peaceful transitions to democracy **ever**. Sometimes you have to drop your ideals for the greater good.

Spain isn’t the only country to have done such a transition. If you look at the others you’ll see that this is a very common thing. The stability of the democracy you take for granted depends on it. New democracies are *extremely* fragile, and transitions require coolheaded prudence.

Some examples:

- Chile transitioned from dictatorship to democracy after a referendum stopped Pinochet’s reign. Pinochet was never convicted.

- After the United States civil war, the leaders of the defeated confederacy were granted amnesty. Not a transition as such, but they needed to get the south back in the fold.

- In 1989 and 1990, those involved in the Argentinian Dirty War were pardoned (revoked a decade later). Two years earlier prosecution had been halted by the *Ley del Punto Final*, under threat by the military of carrying out a coup de état.

4932,"&gt; the localy developed Turkish tank called Altay is going to be produced by a joint venture between Turkish BMC and German Rheinmetal called RBSS

Correct, and so far from the current state of development the Altay is promising. 

This reminds me of the push to ban the transfer of F-35's to Turkey, which is also somewhat funny because Turkey has invested millions into this project. Turkey has developed certain parts of the aircraft, and Turkish engineers are also (to this day) directly working on its construction. But Turkey could possibly be prohibited from receiving their portion which would be outrageous and hilarious at the same time.

The UK has everything we need to become wealthy and prosperous for our people, but our leadership is garbage and tbh so are our voters who elect them and tolerate this sad state. Denmark is another example, they had an empire sure, but it was a few Caribbean islands that became useless with the abolition of slavery and falling sugar prices (they even sold those islands to the USA).

We are an island, secure from any real threat, we are relatively stable and historical were pretty steadfast, the population is well educated enough for now, we have excellent universities, we have enough natural resources to get by (definitely as much or more than Switzerland or Denmark got!). Why Britain insists on getting involved in foreign affairs is beyond me, the average Briton doesn't benefit from it, meanwhile the swiss never stepped outside their country and they are better off in every way.

""Itll take a long time to get on their level, Switzerland built up that wealth over time!"" Of course, but there are many examples of relatively poorer countries developing very quickly. Argentina had a higher GDP per capita than Norway in the 1920s, nowadays Norway is the richest in Europe. Australia didn't exist (as a country) at all in 1800, yet they had the highest GDP per capita in the world by 1900. Finland is forest and lakes and they managed to become wealthy.

&gt; According to legend, the Sultan had originally intended to send £10,000, but either British diplomats or his own ministers requested that the Sultan send only £1,000, so as not to donate more than Queen Victoria, who had sent £2,000. He is also said to have sent three or five ships full of food. The British administration allegedly attempted to block the ships, but by local tradition the food arrived secretly at Drogheda harbour and was left there by Ottoman sailors. Shipping records relating to the port appear not to have survived. Newspaper reports suggest that ships from Thessaloniki in the Ottoman Empire sailed up the River Boyne in May 1847, although it has also been claimed that the river was dry at the time. In 1995, the Drogheda town hall erected a placard in commemoration.

we're talking about how dictators should be treated. We fucked up in WW2, you fucked up in the 1990s. We killed Mussolini and his gerarchi, while you kept Milosevic in power until NATO bombed Belgrade and protected war criminals like Mladic for years. You are an hypocrite.
&gt; 
&gt; When are you recognising the independence of Kosovo
&gt; 
&gt; probably never?

again, you are an hypocrite. Your army perpetrated ethnic cleansing on the Albanians, you still refuse to own up to your crimes and give Kosovo its rightful recognition as an independent nation.

&gt;     take responsibility for the massacre of Srebenica
&gt; 
&gt; Serbia was not responsible for Srebrenica, fact checks are a thing you know.
&gt; 
&gt; and the siege of Sarajevo?
&gt; 
&gt; That's Republika Srpska mate, we're Republika Srbija. 

Give me a fucking break. Everybody knows that the Serbs of Bosnia were given extensive help by Serbia. It is no coincidence that Mladic and other Bosnian Serbs went into hiding in Serbia. They were protected until basically yesterday by your politicians.

&gt; anyway, what does any of these have to do with Italy being fascist and endorising imperialism and genocide in WW2, why are you deflecting?

I am not deflecting. I am pointing out that you are in no position to take the moral high ground, since your nation is neck deep into the kind of war crimes and nationalistic shit that the Italian fascists perpetrated. At least we have largely rejected that shit. While you personally are unapologetic about the shit Serbia has done until yesterday, proof to it you don't want to recognise Kosovo's independence.

5122,"So much bad data analysis going on in this thread. 

1. The data has been collected in one large London area with probably only has a few hundred thousand people. The area is one of the most diverse in the UK, so it's natural that data like this is collected. 

2. The data isn't meant to be some reflection of other countries' educational standards or inherent academic capacity, as some people seem to be reading it. 

3. The data isn't even necessarily meant to tell us anything about how these nationalities will perform in future. Obviously anyone actually studying this from the government's perspective will know to assess how representative their sample is, and thus with what certainty they can expect future members of these groups of perform in a similar way. 

4. What the data tells is about what was going on amongst school leavers in 2014 in that specific borough, which is obviously useful information for the local government when it comes to plannings their resources aimed at helping kids from poorer communities. 

5. What we actually see it pretty interesting. It's natural for the group of children who speak another language as their first language to perform below the national average because of this group a higher number will have sub-average English skills, not because bilingualism brings some inherent disadvantage, but because some will be relatively new arrivals in the country who haven't had chance to adapt to the culture and language, and some will have parents that have poor English skills themselves. Furthermore, statistically speaking, immigrants are always, on average, poorer than the native born population, so there is also a socio-economic factor. The fact that we see speakers of some foreign language performing at a higher level than average is more telling of those communities than the fact we see some communities performing at a below average level.  

6. For the Indian language, Cantonese, and Yoruba, I think it's fair to acknowledge that the culture of these immigrant communities in the UK tends to value education highly and also be reasonably conservative in their approach to raising their children. They are all also well established immigrant communities in the United Kingdom with a historical connection to the country and, thus, earlier periods of migration which probably means a higher percentage of 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants that, while retaining their native languages as a first language at home, are otherwise entirely fluent in the culture and language of the UK. Having multiple generations of these communities living in the UK also allows them to amass social capital, putting a higher number further up the socio-economic ladder. Interestingly, speakers of Mandarin seem to have a similar culture, but without such a well established community in the UK (although this is changing), typically having emigrated more recently for obvious political reasons. 

7. Greek also has a better established community of speakers in the UK, in London especially.

8. Speakers of French and Russian (and possibly Dutch too?) contain a lot of members that have moved for tax reasons and/or banking. So I'd wager we'd see an above average socio-economic status amongst those communities. 

9. The UK has had a lot of immigration from Portugal in the last decade or so, and the grounds for migration is typically economic, so I reckon we'd see a lower socio-economic average there, which is the same logic that applies to most of the former eastern bloc nationalities.

10. Speakers of Italian, Spanish, and German seem to be performing exactly how we'd expect communities speakers of a foreign language to perform assuming a equivalent average socio-economic level to the sample average, with no significant cultural impact on performance in education, and no advantages or disadvantages arising from the significance of the presence of the community in the area.

5152,"Well, there are all the other London boroughs which can contribute; most of them will be close. Together they make up a population of about 8-9 Million. Plus some other urban boroughs such as Manchester, Liverpool etc.  
Also don't forget that to compare the different first languages of students learning English, they don't have to be in the same borough. For rarer languages such as, say, Finnish or Laotian, the idea is to get as many first language speakers across the country as possible.  
The issue I have is that this whole statistic as Lambeth did it is a bit questionable; I mean, what's this supposed to tell us? That speaking some first languages make learning English easier, or more difficult? Or that there are cultural differences in language learning reflected in spoken first language?  
The thing is, that statistic doesn't even appear to adjust for the fact that some of the students measured here were born in London whereas others may have arrived there in their teens. Some of those that are later arrivals had some English training in schools in their home country, others didn't. Some kids even come from countries where English is a lingua franca and taught and spoken from an early age (e.g. India); this statistic may highlight that but does not adjust for that.

5157,"&gt; The Canadians slap tariffs on our milk and dairy products

Dairy is not a part of NAFTA and is not included in the trade agreement. Canadian diary is regulated - meaning there is a quota of how much diary can be produced in a year. Since the US diary is not regulated *and US diary farmers get massive subsidy*, Canada cannot just allow US diary products in because it will destroy the canadian diary system. If you want change, then you will have to allow 5+ years for Canada to slowly remove the quota system and the canadian government to give massive subsidies to the diary industry to grow them upto par with the US and then open up the market. A new NAFTA agreement must allow for all these steps to happen. 

*Canada has no reason to trust the US on such an agreement if it is ever drafted.* That is because softwood lumber is covered in the existing NAFTA agreement and the US does not follow the agreed upon terms. US lost the court case 3 times now and STILL decides to tax lumber because ""might is right"". If that is the attitude then Canada is better of not negotiating anything with the US at all. A new NAFTA must also pay the compensation to Canada for the losses caused by such illegal taxes placed on lumber and any other disputed where the US lost the case in a court of law.

5160,"Well...there's an [unregistered trademark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unregistered_trademark).

&gt;An unregistered or common law trademark is an enforceable mark created by a business or individual to signify or distinguish a product or service. A common law or unregistered trademark is legally different from a registered trademark granted by statute.
&gt;
&gt;As with statutory trademarks, a common law trademark utilizes graphics, images, words or symbols, or a combination of such, to signify the distinctiveness or source of a product or service.
&gt;
&gt;Although not required by law to receive trademark protection, an unregistered trademark owner can append the mark with the letters ""TM"" (visualized by the trademark symbol ™). A ™ serves as notice to the public the words or symbols are an unregistered trademark. In contrast, trademarks granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) may have the ® symbol next to the trademark. The USPTO prohibits a common law, unregistered trademark owner using the ® in the trademark.
&gt;
&gt;A significant distinction of an unregistered trademark is the trademark owner does not receive as much protection as the owner of a federal or state registered trademark. For example, in the United States a trademark registered by the USPTO can enforce the trademark in all U.S. states, sue for damages (including lost profits), and significantly, recover attorneys' fees and costs incurred in protecting the trademark against infringement. If a trademark owner registers in a state, the trademark owner can enforce the trademark throughout the entire state, and receive similar statutory remedies.

The main point about this not being able to moved around is that this is closer to architecture than it is to an esculpture. Architecture is (most of the times) thought to be in an specific place, unlike other kinds of arts. And this is meant to be a piece part of a building (a Cathedral that holds other sepulchral monuments in the surrounding rooms). In that sense it's a little like designing a facade, or a piece of furniture for an specific place. The contrast with the other monuments around it can also be very relevant.

It's also important to recognise that this intrinsically connected to the presence of the Queen's corpse, which will be in the crypt underneath when she dies, and as such it's not really meant to be observed out of that spiritual context —in which case it would be kitsch.

But it shows the War as a truly global phenomenon, it tries to rise above individual national narratives, while still granting them plenty of attention.

News of the week: Violence in an empoverished neighbourhood in [Anderlecht] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderlecht), Brussels.

* The neighbourhood Peterbos has been suffering under drug dealing gangs, consisting out of local youth of mostly foreign descent, for a while now. But it's only after some of them beat up controllers of public transport service [MIVB/STIB] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_Intercommunal_Transport_Company) that it made big news. As a reaction the MIVB/STIB bus drivers struck for a day.
* Not only MIVB/STIB staff get the short end of the stick. Also police, journalists and sometimes even firemen and ambulance drivers get attacked. A crew of the [Flemish public broadcaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlaamse_Radio-_en_Televisieomroeporganisatie) filmed [how they were attacked with stones] (https://www.msn.com/tr-tr/video/fun/une-%C3%A9quipe-de-la-vrt-agress%C3%A9e-dans-le-quartier-peterbos-%C3%A0-anderlecht/vp-AAwgKoH), luckily no one got hurt. The stone thrower got arrested.

In other news:

* Terrorists [Salah Abdeslam] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah_Abdeslam) and Sofien Ayari got sentenced to a prison penalty of 20 years for their role in the [police raids in Brussels in 2016] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Brussels_police_raids). Abdeslam still has to face court in France for his involvements in the November 2015 Paris attacks.
* The conservative Flemish-nationalist party [N-VA] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Flemish_Alliance) has presented their candidates for the [local elections in Brussels] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_local_elections,_2018), in October this year. Unlike most other Flemish parties, who partner with their Francophone sister parties in Brussels, N-VA faces the election alone. Currently the N-VA has four people in town councils of Brussels, a number they plan to increase. They have lists in [11 out of 19 municipalities] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_municipalities_of_the_Brussels-Capital_Region) and hope to force their breakthrough in the bilingual region, as recent polls indicated their party is gaining support amongst the Francophone population. 
* The odd thing about this is that the presentation was lead by Federal Secretary of State for Asylum and Migration [Theo Francken] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_Francken), who doesn't live in Brussels. The local election folders of N-VA also give more attention to Francken and his collegue, the Federal Minister of the Interior [Jan Jambon] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Jambon). This of course happens with a reason. N-VA makes security and integration the main points of their campaign, and both officials are very popular at the moment, and more well known than the local candidates. With the Peterbos case being in the news right now, one could argue they couldn't have picked a better timing.
* Controversy about a new member of the regent council of the [National Bank] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bank_of_Belgium). Cédric Frère replaces his father in the council, who on his turn already followed up *his* father, [Albert Frère] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Fr%C3%A8re). Albert Frère is individually the richest man in Belgium, and many people are outraged that he gets away with basicly creating a dynasty in one of the most important institutions of our country. It didn't really help that his son said that the membership of the council is ""a right to his family"". Cédric Frère's membership was proposed by the liberal majority party [MR] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouvement_R%C3%A9formateur), that has good ties with the Frère family, but the entire [cabinet] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Government) agreed with it. This caused some cringeworthy reactions from majority MPs, who don't want to defend the undefendable, but at the same time can't credibly criticise it either.
* A 43 year old male nurse from [Namur] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namur) is suspected of killing 21 patients through poisoning, most of them in an elderly care center. It's not sure if all of them were actually murdered, but it all were suspicious deads that can be traced to this one nurse.

5285,"I've been there a year ago.

I was really impressed by it - by the architecture and by the size of the (main) exhibition. You can easily spend several hours in there.

The highlight for me was the room documenting the Hiroshima bomb: a small room with uneven white plates on the wall and a bomb replica hanging right about your head. You normally only look up when your read the sign that tells you to, but when you do it still gives you a really anxious feeling.

But not all was good, especially that stuff connected to the controversy of the Polish government influencing the exhibition. In all fairness, I might be biased since I'm German and my grandma is from Eblag/Elbing even though never had adversities against Poles. Anyway, I had my doubts that the exhibition was completely objective neutral. Especially in the presentation of pre-WWII Danzig and the role of Poland during the war I found the exhibition to be a bit one-sided.

However, when I heard about the Polish government firing the old curator and employing a new one, I feared for worse (is that correct grammar? I'm drunk).

Austerity came about because *European* people tended to vote center-right governments supporting austerity and 3% deficit rule. 

Yes, there are a lot of lobbyist in the EU. EU is a market economy, so of course EU wants business to flow in the EU. To say business flows in EU is something bad is ridiculous. EU has never been against market economy. Do you seriously believe Europeans themselves don't want EU to be a market economy, that it's an American commanded to EU?

And when it comes to tax havens, if you don't know, EU has years been tackling the issue. EU is planning a tax for large IT companies who utilize tax havens in EU. EU sued Ireland for example and [forced Ireland to collect 13 billion euros from Apple, an American company](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/05/ireland-reaches-deal-with-apple-to-collect-13bn-in-back-taxes).
&gt;And all that is following Washington wish to have a tamed and murican business friendly EU.

Uh, no? You do realise that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between EU and the US has been negotiated for years longer than planned, because EU opposes so many American business practices. For example when it comes to food, the stuff sold as Parmesan in the US would be illegal to sell as Parmesan in the EU. Microsoft, an American company, has receiced fines from EU totaling way over billion euros. Likewise Intel, an American company, has received fines of over billion euros.

If charging takes as long as it does now, it is a process that requires time dedicated to it. That means that for grand majority, it will fall outside of office hours, which also means that there will be congestion. That compromises the grid stability and makes the driving very expensive.

Plug-in hybrids are pretty neck and neck with full battery electrics right now, but as they have less downsides tied to their scale of adoption, i would reckon they keep rising in popularity, where full on electrics will stall.

Also the share of renewables is more indicative of market dynamics. The price of electricity went down after the financial crisis as whole. As green energy tends to have tariff price that is over the market price, it obviously claims a share. It's a bit like back in the days when agricultural subsidies used to be tariffed.

It's the trading of growing the size of an economy for decreased social stability - especially when that economic growth means creating migrant ethnic underclasses.

You cannot just look at the matter as if humans are transferable economic units. We live in democracies and human nature is such that identity politics will swell when people feel threatened by immigration. The consequence of which is an outcome that isn't good for the economy (that's literally the story of Brexit, no?).

Immigration policy is a balancing act. You get these people who say things like ""we could grow the productivity of Earth by a billion percent with open borders"" and it's total nonsense because the consequence of that would be all out warfare.

We all have dumb ape brains, high levels of immigration threatens our societies by activating people's capacity for tribalism. It starts with collapsed mutual trust and ends in blood. There's a reason borders and nations exist, it's because people have a tendency to get murderously upset when they don't, and that's just a universal human truth.

I think it's something to do with the UK's immigration policies. For non-EU people, you can only come in if you have a job offer paying at least £30,000, and have some savings, or if you are in a desired occupation (such as nursing). This policy has been in place for a decade.

The children of those people are the ones currently in school (and speak their own language at home). If the parents are bright and skilled, the children will be bright and motivated too. 

For the Europeans, there is no such restriction and the UK's non-contributory benefit system has attracted bottom feeders.

Hopefully this explains why the UK is Brexiting and will likely bring in rules for Europeans similar to those for non-EU people after Brexit (everyone will be subject to the £30,000 earnings  requirement or the skills requirement).",,/r/europe/comments/8frdf5/performance_of_foreign_children_in_english_gcse/dy5tlgq/,alyssas,1525009542

In a way, this Queen had to choose an artist too, one of her lifetime, and he decided to choose someone who doesn't look to be a monarchist a at all, at least at first glance.

Which is why I think this distinction is useless. Apart from that  ""conservativism"" is not  an ""ideology""; it's keeping things the way they are.

In a nation that currently has a monarchy conservativism would on that field entail monarchism whereas in a nation that currently has a republic conservativism would entail republicanism which are two opposing actual ideologies.

The difference is that as said in no republic is anyone seriously trying to transform the country into a monarchy and that's the reason why the conservatives will always end up on the wrong side of history because no one is trying to change things for stupid reasons but people very often try to keep things the same for stupid reasons.","Maar oma, waarom heeft u zo'n grote negerlul?",/r/europe/comments/8fpsl8/queen_margrethe_of_denmarks_sarcophagus_by_danish/dy5oszk/,my_farts_will_go_on,1525001386

A building has its own history, and rebuilding it is just faking it. In the opposite side of this is Viollet-le-Duc's [happy fake](http://fiveminutehistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Carcassonne-800-x-400_3-800x400.jpg) [extravaganza](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Notre_Dame_de_Paris%2C_East_View_140207_1.jpg/220px-Notre_Dame_de_Paris%2C_East_View_140207_1.jpg), wherein he rebuilt things but not to back how they were, but how the thinks ""the people back then would've built them if they had the tech to do so"", so basically, imaginary medieval stuff (the towers in Carcassone are all fake, the spire in Notre Dame never existed, etc.)

So basically, I'm not in favour of rebuilding as is, and I understand that what they built back then is pretty crappy, but it's not as if they had a better solution. In post-war Spain steel was heavily restricted for construction until the 60' since the few we had available was used in bridges and industry, so as a result most rebuilt housing is shit, but it's not like they had much choice.

5710,"&gt; Whether the new version is constitutional is a different matter entirely that 1 BvR 1087/91 doesn't touch.

If I recall properly, the new version of the BayEUG only differs so much from the former one in that it added a section about the crosses having to be taken off only after a student complained and a fair agreement between him and the school was not reached.

However, this does not remove the original rule that each and any of Bavaria's schools has to have crosses per se.

 &gt; Art. 7 BayEUG (4) S. 1: Angesichts der geschichtlichen und kulturellen Prägung Bayerns wird in jedem Klassenraum ein Kreuz angebracht. S. 2: Damit kommt der Wille zum Ausdruck, die obersten Bildungsziele der Verfassung auf der Grundlage christlicher und abendländischer Werte unter Wahrung der Glaubensfreiheit zu verwirklichen. S. 3: Wird der Anbringung des Kreuzes aus ernsthaften und einsehbaren Gründen des Glaubens oder der Weltanschauung durch die Erziehungsberechtigten widersprochen, versucht die Schulleiterin bzw. der Schulleiter eine gütliche Einigung. S. 4: Gelingt eine Einigung nicht, hat sie bzw. er nach Unterrichtung des Schulamts für den Einzelfall eine Regelung zu treffen, welche die Glaubensfreiheit des Widersprechenden achtet und die religiösen und weltanschaulichen Überzeugungen aller in der Klasse Betroffenen zu einem gerechten Ausgleich bringt; dabei ist auch der Wille der Mehrheit, soweit möglich, zu berücksichtigen."" (version of 31.05.2000)

So in conclusion this does not remove the binding duty of each school to put up crosses (see Art. 7 IV 1 BayEUG). And precisely that is incompatible with the guidelines 1 BvR 1087/91 put forward. Because it's completely unintuitive to interpret a cross on the wall in a mere ""cultural"" way. It's a direct symbol of a religion and any other interpretation is simply unworldly or a concealed attempt to smuggle religious symbols in.

Also as far as I understand the development of our jurisdiction also in regard to the ""Kopftuch""-cases, they explicitly pointed out that government institutions have to be 100% neutral since they do not posess an Art. 4 GG themselves. However, the people working/attending there can in fact exert Art. 4 GG which then allows them to wear religious symbols.

In short: The building must be neutral, the people in it don't have to be.",Germany (European Federation),/r/europe/comments/8fl7ms/bavaria_germany_csu_calls_critics_of_crucifix/dy5ow7m/,Morrow_20,1525001592

Yeah, they just burned down the White House and called it a day because you were not important enough to spend a few more soldiers on you. Nice btw how you just started ranting irrelevant nationalist bs. Furthermore, without France your country would not even exist. Lastly, maybe you should take a look at a globe at least once in your life to consider why it might be that you are relatively safe. Hint: It has nothing to do with all that exceptionalist kool-aid you guys love to swallow.

&gt;France is just as fucked as the US.

Tell me about that when the murder rate in France gets close to yours, and when the country is ruled by a right wing populist nutjob that does not even employ enough diplomats etc to keep up his country's relationships. Also, France's international image is massively better than yours, and they got, gasp, a working healthcare system too.

You have on average more than one school-shooting per week.

5725,"It pulls a lot of references to the surroundings too. it will be placed side\-by\-side with the sarcophagi of a lot of the previous rulers, and the ""heraldy"" on top is very much in line with some of those.

The style of the \(gilded\) symbols is quite simple, but is very much representative of the queen and prince consort themselves.

So you have the base with 7 steps, allegedly a religious reference \(to both christianity and the prince consorts interest in eastern religions\), on top of that the three pillars for each of the parts of the commonwealth, the elephants referring to the order of the elephant and the heraldrics of previous royals.

On top of that you have the crystal sarcophagus with the queen and the prince consort contoured inside, there has been no official statement on the intended interpretation of this, but given she has been the queen since 1953, I think the transparency of the sarcophagus may be alluding to the change of the royalty's role in terms of the media and the level of access the public has. It also gives an image of the queen in crystal, it's beautiful and clear, but a bit cold and anonymous.

And then on top of that in a big messy blob of gilded symbols \- there's the heraldry of course \(polar bear, ram, lion,  crown, hearts etc.\) but you also have a copy of the constitution, some shields with heraldry of her family, a sailboat, and then you've got the queen's pet dogs, a janus mask, a palette, paint brushes, a book of the lord of the rings \(the queen illustrated the original danish translation\),  and other stuff that I can't see / don't know what is, and then a strand of DNA that runs from the top to the bottom.

So the blob on top is a bit gaudy but very symbolic of the queen as a person, what was important to her in life and what defined her \- as a monarch and particularly as an individual. And I think this level of intimacy or personality on a sarcophagus \(or tombstone if you will\) is what really sets it apart and makes it more ""modern"", while the core composition is kept quite traditional.

It's good enough already that he was that way before, as in it would be worse that had always aimed at ending up working for kings. It's hard to tell, from the distance, which kind of things happened so that he would make such a switch. Starting being part of academy does, if his specific academy isn't independent and it's involved with royalty.

I'd say that the key thing is who approached whom and how. If the artist actively reached the monarchy, then it's on him —and still, it'd be argueable if he does so that he can have money to do what he wants to do, and not in a ""seeking the benefits"" kind of way—; if the monarcy reachs the artist as someone who was succesful before their involvement, then that's 100% the artist's merit, and if he can in fact change the ""establishment art"" with his influence —instead of forfeiting his ideas and style—, that can be seen as extra successful, too.",seditious af,/r/europe/comments/8fpsl8/queen_margrethe_of_denmarks_sarcophagus_by_danish/dy5ozfh/,Erratic85,1525001791

5794,"&gt;blight on democracy


There are almost no parties who get +50% at any democratic election (talking absolute, as well as relative numbers), but they are still declared the winners and are appointed to form a new government by the president. Additionally to the position of the prime minister, which in general goes to the winning party, most of the times the winning party steam-rolls its junior partners and takes the significant minister positions for itself, making them the de facto rulers of the nation. 


At the Dutch general election in 2017 the strongest party got 21.3% at a turnout of 81.9%, meaning only 17,44% of the population voted for VVD. Nonetheless they are dictating the direction in which the country will move in the next 5 years, and in many occasions they will enforce their idea of the country over that of their junior partners. 


It is therefore pure populism to call direct democratic referenda anti-democratic. In parliament, politicians steam-roll their opinion on a far larger number of topics, with far higher frequency, while referenda are usually tied to only one topic and take place very rarely, if at all. For me it is telling, that people who often call them self free thinkers, or liberals (lat. liber - free) have the highest reluctance to the idea free choice, i.e of giving the power (κρατός-kratós) to the people (δῆμος-dēmos). Part of a free choice is also the possibility not to chose anything, which is highly demonized nowadays. 


&gt;Every vote counts!


Sure, but what if no party represents your ideas of the world and you don't want to neither support nor be against the political system, i.e. people who don't want to be forced to an opinion on a topic somebody else dictates. Well, the only possibility to make your opinion heard on the topics you think are important is through referenda, which are then called ""anti-democratic"".

5810,"The way I understand how this works is that it's impossible because ""Queen"" does not exist; technically she was the King.

There is only one King and can only be one King; in the Netherlands formally on paper ""Queen Maxima"" for instance is actually the Prince-Consort but she _informally_ carries the title ""Queen"" because that title has no legal meaning in the constitution and anyone can carry it. The King before William-Alexander—Beatrix—was still King regardless her being female.

In theory they could've named her male spouse—Claus—""Queen"" and named her ""King"" but that would be a bit strange so informally they named her ""Queen"" whilst on paper in the most formal contexts she was still ""King"".

All those ""Queens"" which are addressed as Queen _informally_ on paper are never Queen and never equal; they are firmly below the actual King and on paper merely prince-consort and in practice they also obviously do not have the same responsibilities and powers as the actual King.

Edit: Also historically the feminine forms of this titles did not refer to a female person holding those positions as they couldn't even hold them but to a female _spouse_ of the person who holds them.

Like in French the French Academy to this day apparently defines ""le président"" as the president of the nation—whatever its sex—and ""la présidente"" as the spouse of the president of the nation—whatever its sex.

Hey, you are trying to divert this conversation by concentrating on the wordings and the source when I told you from the start, I don't compile a list of links that support my arguments. I understand you are trying to belittle me, but it's important to note that anyone can be involved in politics and everyone should contribute to it. I am a mathematician, that still doesn't mean that I am clueless about the conflict or the essence of what is being instructed in these international resolutions. Instructions the Armenian side continues to not follow, so maybe they are the ones who need a lesson.  Belittlement is usually a last resort when feeling trapped, cornered or looking for a cheap alternative to end a conversation. Kudos to the author of that webpage though. 

With that clarification out of the way, I don't know why you are continuously ignoring legitimate and simple points that I am questioning. They have been introduced as **Armenian** forces and in the contexts of certain legislation they are called **forces**. In these contexts that refer to them plainly as just a force, who's force is it? You cannot claim that this statement isn't vague, even though it directly implicates the ruling authority of these occupied territories regardless (hint: armenians). To question your point, where does this force reside in? What is the ethnic composition of this force? Where does this force receive its training, military equipment, and economic contributions from? Why does Armenia involve themselves with this """"""""""""""""force"""""""""""""""""", assisting them in taking away Azerbaijani land? 

These are genuine questions being ignored in this conversation, by a person stuck on the wording of a certain link. You've gotta be a lawyer? This force is simply the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh (cited as Armenian forces in many resolutions) receiving direct assistance and manpower from Armenia.

&gt;I said that the problem is it actively denies it

I don't see a problem with this at this stage.

&gt; just an example that no peace process can be solved if everyone starts adding ""I would also like this and this"" to it.

Which is why Armenians refused the accept the first purposed plan for a peace settlement, right. Azerbaijan should **certainly** add it to the bucket (issue about Naxchivan) if Nagorno-Karabakh ever wants to see themselves established as a real entity. Though we all know this self-determination talk is a load of bullshit, and Armenians are just waiting for the day to unite both pieces of territory under some future democratic referendum -&gt; this was the initial motive of the conflict.

Saying that Trump is a reflection of America is like saying Mugabe is a reflection of Zimbabwean society. 

Trump is a reflection of a corrupt political system, political apathy, and, most importantly, (if my math is correct) a reflection of only 19% of voting Americans. 

**&gt;80% of the country did not vote for Trump.** Of Americans that were eligible to vote, a quick, rough, estimate is telling me that 72% of eligible voters in the United States did not vote for Trump. 

---

US population=325.7 million

Population of eligible voters=220 million~ 

Votes for Trump in 2016 presidential= 62.979 million


First one: 63/325=.1938= **~19.38% of the total US population voted for trump.**

Second one 63/220~=.2863=**28.63% of eligible voters in the US voted for Trump.**


For context, approximately 20.2% of the total American population voted for Hilary Clinton, which means that 29.9% of eligible voters voted for HRC.
