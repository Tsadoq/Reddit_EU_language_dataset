I do not believe they provide a convenient scapegoat, although I do acknowledge that they could've been staged. But I doubt that they were.

Regarding Lithuanian interests, I'm not talking about Astravyets, I'm just talking about the fact that NATO ought not to lose Belarus to Russia. And Lukashenka is the biggest defender of Belarusian sovereignty and stability as of now. Every revolution breeds instability and unpredictable results. I don't want a revolution in Belarus under these circumstances where Kremlin has a lot to gain. If a power vacuum takes place in Belarus, we all know what is gojng to fill it, and who has the most to gain from filling it. No way is Belarus institutionally ready to switch to another leader.

As for calling the oppositionary forces Russian projects - I do not think that is arguing in bad faith. In authoritarian regimes, the economic and the political go hand in hand. Babarika's past is clear. If that wasn't clear, Tsepkala's escape to Russia is a clear-as-day pure propaganda move. There's enough proof for me to claim that the default position on these matters should be that of mine, until evidence proves otherwise. But so far, it hasn't. 

As for Tsihanovski's stance on Crimea: he had visited Crimea under Russian jurisdiction. Political people usually understand what their actions imply. I'd personally never visit Crimea, because I'd be taking a position that I don't want to take if I did. I understand that this isn't sufficient to show his affiliations, but when put in context of Tspekala and Babarika, and that their campaigns united... 

Rhetoric doesn't have to be pro-Russian, as democracy isn't Russia's goal. The goal is to fake real democratic processes (debates, many positions, etc.) and to cockblock the West from supporting Lukashenka - if the West does that, it will get called anti-democratic.

I'm sure Belarusian democrats are also enjoying great coverage on Russian TV, although I haven't checked it.

48,"&gt;Yes bullshit you fool.

I guess you didnt even check the website. ~105€ for 100 masks. 

&gt;I do know the situation there very well. I have many friends in Sweden, lived there, speak Swedish and listen to Swedish radio most days.

Keyword: Lived. So not anymore, do you visit Swedish grocery stores every week? Do you visit Swedish pharmacies every week? Do you buy from any Swedish e-retailers at Swedish prices? Radio doesnt really report the price on masks or anything, nor the price on soap or hand sanitizers nor the availability of any of it all in the 290 municipalities we got. It's pretty anecdotal to relay on personal account, but it's a fact that the availability of any of the mentioned products above have varying degrees of availability in Sweden, as is the case for my municipality, the trend of rising prices on hand sanitizers is also another fact still being ~400% to ~800% above normal price and at it's height the price was ~2270% above normal price. Soap availability is less of a problem in larger cities and larger stores but Sweden is far from conisting of only larger cities so in smaller cities with smaller stores the availability is worse. 

&gt;I also know that making your own masks doesn't cost anything, which is what Czechs did. so shut up whining and go do that.

With what? I cant make material magically appear, I'd have to buy material either way which isnt free and most people would have to too so no it's not free. There's also no real need for masks when the [trend is downwards for Sweden](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/09f821667ce64bf7be6f9f87457ed9aa) even without masks or lockdown which goes against the trend for Europe as a whole, where the trend is upwards and several countries had to shut down again or close borders against specific countries again.",Kungariket Sverige,/r/europe/comments/i0qh1f/no_country_for_face_masks_nordics_brush_off_mouth/fzumaa0/,weirdowerdo,1596193002

55,"My best example to refute this is a country that got out of its deficit recently but was taken to court by the European commission.

[This graph clearly shows Ireland massive deficit - and how they eventually achieved a small surplus through practises we will talk about next - and how this angered the EU commission.](https://tradingeconomics.com/ireland/government-budget)

Ireland offered apple reduced taxes to attract industry and the EU commission took them to court for unfair competition practises. The EU must all have equal corporate tax... (That seems at face value fair right)... But it facilitates the system. It keeps Surplus nations in surplus and deficit nations in deficit. Deficit nations need to attract industry and foreign investment, and the way to do that is to drop corporate tax. Corporate tax competition is also prevalent from state to state in the USA. States without enough business and industry must lower corporate tax to attract. And other states, might decide to increase it if employment and GDP is doing well.

[Apple And Ireland Challenge EU Over $14.4 Billion Tax Ruling](https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2019/09/16/apple-and-ireland-challenge-eu-over-144-billion-tax-ruling/)

So holding nations into account - sure. But handcuffing into inability to actually attract and create industry relative to their partners that ALREADY have that industry is not fair.

There needs to be a swing in capital investment towards countries who are willing to work harder, longer hours for lower pay.

[In Greece, people work longer days than anywhere else in the European Union, clocking up on average 42.3 hours per week, according to Eurostat.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/02/greeks-work-longest-hours-in-europe/)

So are the Greeks to blame for their corrupt government making millions with Eurozone partners and part of the elite? In part yes... Ill give you that. But the other part, is how is this situation fixed? And one of the ways is to accept that the system not just in Greece, but as a whole is rigged. And this is bad for EU synergy and the future of the Eurozone. We need to understand that this is not just an Italian, or Greek or Irish problem but a systemic problem that goes to the top.

So there are two schools of thought.. One is that people can immigrate to another EU nation to make a living, and the other is to attract industry so people dont have to pack up their lives and create brain drains, and leave the country completely bankrupt.

I think the most honest thing to do, is allow countries to charge their own corporate tax level.

The thing is the 'deficit' situation is NATURAL in the way the economy is structured right now. The accounting books MUST balance. And for every Surplus, there must be a deficit somewhere else. Its simple economics really.

72,"Google Translate:

There is no new agreement for the use of Danish music on YouTube. Google is in the process of blocking Danish music on Friday.

This is because Google and Koda have not been able to land a new agreement for the use of Koda's Danish music on YouTube.

Koda manages the rights of composers and songwriters.

Therefore, Google, which owns YouTube, on Friday started blocking Danish music from the service, and by midnight all Danish music will be unavailable.

This is what Dan Chalmers, director of YouTube Music in Europe, said on Friday.

We are already removing it because we respect the rights of artists and songwriters.

This is a situation we have desperately tried to avoid, and I hope we can find a solution as soon as possible. We are ready 24/7 to find an appointment. We have already negotiated with Koda and done our best. But I do not think it is a fair deal that Koda demands, he says.

Working on a new agreement

The parties have for some time been negotiating a new agreement for the use of Danish music, after the national agreement expired in April.

Work is underway to make a joint Nordic agreement, which will replace the local agreements of the Norwegian, Finnish and Danish composers and songwriting companies.

A temporary extension expires Saturday. That's why the music will be blocked before Saturday.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/i15kug/google_blocks_all_danish_music_on_youtube_today/fzumpn8/,Econ_Orc,1596193400

174,"&gt; Yeah, I've read reports of tens of thousands of Ukrainians dying in Illovaisk alone. Do you believe everything you read?

But thousands of Ukrainians did die in Illovaisk. Nobody doubts that it  happened, just like nobody doubts that Russian soldiers have been killed en masse in Donbass, it's the true numbers that are hard to find out.

&gt; Is it mostly Russian? Is it at least significantly Russian?

Leadership, equipment, machinery, goals and orders are Russian. 

&gt; the composition of current militia

If you are talking about locals who decided to fight Ukraine then I can tell you this: if you join an invading force to help them conquer your country and kill your neighbors - you don't get called 'countrymen' anymore because you are not fighting for the same country. People who join the invading side are usually called traitors or collaborationist. 

Most locals have either fled the region or just want to stay at home and get back to normal life.

&gt; and (most significantly by far) Odessa

In France, the police got a bunch of rights that are normally reserved for the military in a state of emergency after the horrible bataclan terrorist attack. Thing is, officially, the state of emergency just never stopped, and now those emergency military rights are just normal police law (stuff like not needing a judge decree to search a house, not needing to have a suspicion when arresting you etc.).

216,"700 years ago the german imperial bureaucracy in Mainz tried to figure out a way to refer to various places in the HRE. Northern Germany posed a problem: by that time the Duke of Saxony ruled a completely different area from where the germanic tribe the Saxons had lived. So calling both a vast area on the northern german plane *and* a duchy in the mountainous region next to Bohemia by the traditional name was not going to fly. So they decided to call the area in the plane, i.e. the low-lands, lower Saxony. 

The name then mostly went away for centuries, though it was used as a catch-all for that region form time to time. After WW2, the Brits wanted to form a new state there as part of the allied effort to democratize Germany. Since they amalgamated several diverse regions with no clear claim for dominance by any of them, they just re-used this semi-official name for the region.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/i0oej5/west_vs_east_germany_gdp_per_capita_1991_vs_2018/fzu7pkf/,skgoa,1596178401

291,"No offence to you personally, but a lot of what you wrote is just misrepresentative of the situation both in Belarus and Ukraine.

&gt;unlike in Ukraine where the language is being revived and increasingly favoured especially by younger people 

Apparently, the phrase ""let people use what language they want"" doesn't translate very well into Ukrainian.

TV quotas. Movies in cinemas can only be ran in Ukrainian, even in majority Russian-speaking regions.

Schooling in Russian will be cancelled from September of this year, with very few exceptions. Schooling in Hungarian/Romanian/Bulgarian (way less than 10% of the population, combined), however, will be cancelled only in 2023. And this is in a country where tons of people speak Russian in day-to-day life.

I dunno man, seems like discrimination to me.

Don't get me wrong - it's completely normal to have a state language and have people learn it, but how hard can it be not to discriminate the speakers of other languages? Hell, Finland has 2 official languages - Finnish and Swedish, despite the Swedes only being 6% of the population. Switzerland has 4 official languages.

And yet, starting from 1 September, 2020, there will be no Russian-language education. That'll surely get everybody to want to learn Ukrainian. 

Banning Russian =/= reviving Ukrainian.

&gt;i suppose people lack the patriotism needed to love ones own mother tongue 

What? Russian is my mother tongue, and let he who thinks that I hate my country cast the first stone. Somebody's language choice often has nothing to do with their political stance.

Not at all, I'm more than happy to talk to people with whom I disagree, so long as they have a genuine desire to make the world a better place. However, due to your binary and conformist views, you are not capable of having a genuine desire to improve the world. All you are capable of is wishing to yourself that racism could end, or poverty, or anything else. But you will never *do something* about it that would make a genuine systemic change, because you are a 'centrist', and you have faith in a government and police that are not designed nor willing to protect and serve its people. And no, an individual act of charity does not constitute genuine change.

&gt;What kind of ""behaviour""?

Our governments refuse to hold the police accountable for their violent racist activity, yet because it's enforced by the state, you're not bothered by it enough to *demand* change. You might want it, but you aren't ride or die for it. BLM turning to violence after peaceful protests against this violence didn't work is, however, unacceptable to you simply because it does not have the authority of the state. Again, the way you think about the world limits your interpretation of it. 

&gt;we have laws and the rule of law

Yes, and those laws are not being upheld, and the powers that be refuse to change the necessary things to make a difference. This is because the groups breaking them are part of the machine that governs and polices us. In a perfect centrist world, they would listen to us and the police wouldn't do racist violence any more, but we don't live in a perfect centrist world, and something has to be done about it.

Also, if there's one concept you take away from us talking, please let it be that laws are completely flexible. People can write good laws, bad laws, and ineffective laws, and they're very easy to change when in power. As such, laws are a completely neutral tool, not inherently good. We must fight hard to merely protect the good laws we have, as well as to make good new ones. 

&gt; where does it end? Who is allowed to be targeted with violence according to you?

For me, the question should be reversed - who should *not* be the target of violence. People who have not been reasonably proven to have committed a crime should not be subjected to violence. Anyone who does so should be subject to the violence of our legal system - but if they're wearing blue, chance are they won't be. The state supports this, and that's not acceptable.

As for ideology, I was being admittedly flippant when I said chucked in jail. You have decided that grass roots violence, no matter the source, is more dangerous than state violence, no matter the source. If you want to work towards a better tomorrow for minority groups (and indeed all of us), then you have to renounce the idea that the state knows best, because they clearly are not going to change until they're made to, and this shit cannot continue. If you disagree, then you are indirectly endangering minority groups and do not belong in a democratic society - you have too many fascist leanings.

It depends on your definition of violence, but honestly if you think that we shouldn't fight police brutality because the state knows best, then I think you should be legally bound to be educated on why that's wrong. Think of it like community service, or those sensitivity courses they send bigots on sometimes.

&gt;mobs violently attacking people in the streets

If you think BLM is more likely to do this to the police than vice versa in a protest scenario then you don't know what you're talking about.

&gt;So what is the alternative?

Resist. Stop being a conformist. Realise that the state is merely part of an eco-system along with its people and its rich, and that the three should ideally keep eachother in check. Right now, the rich and the state are 69'ing eachother and the people are being dunked on by both.

You do not understand what being a centrist even means. Being a centrist does not mean that you think that the status quo is perfect, that there aren't any problems etc. It means being pragmatic, compromising and serving the entirety of the people, not just some vocal and/or ideological segment of the population. Being centrist means that you are not stuck in some hyper-ideological worldview.

&gt;Our governments

Because the situation in the US, UK and the Western Europe is exactly the same? ""Violent racist activity"" by the police is negligible in the Western world outside of the US, hardly a reason to start some kind of borderline revolution or whatever it is that you are proposing. There does not have to be a revolution for every problem or crime that occurs.

&gt;BLM turning to violence after peaceful protests against this violence didn't work is, however, unacceptable to you simply because it does not have the authority of the state.

How did this even become about BLM or the US? We were talking about mob violence directed at private individuals.

&gt;You have decided that grass roots violence, no matter the source, is more dangerous than state violence, no matter the source.

Unjust state violence is very rare in the Western world (again outside the US, at least) and there are multiple avenues to obtain justice if it does occur. Your ""grass roots"" violence is basically terrorism. Again, if we were talking about an uprising or something in some authoritarian state, it would be a different discussion. But you are simply encouraging political and mob violence in mature democracies, which is dangerous and completely unnecessary.

&gt;If you disagree, then you are indirectly endangering minority groups and do not belong in a democratic society - you have too many fascist leanings.

So you are again showing that it is a ""you are either with us or against us"" kind of thing and that if I am not with the far left I should either be exiled, imprisoned or murdered(?)? And who is going to be the arbiter of whether or not someone is ""passionate"" enough about fighting injustice? Is there going to be some kind of revolutionary/""people's"" council or something? I am getting some serious communistesque vibes here.

&gt;It depends on your definition of violence, but honestly if you think that we shouldn't fight police brutality because the state knows best

I have never said that the state is perfect or that nothing should be done about the problems that society faces today. You are simply creating a false dilemma of ""engage in a violent struggle or you are with the state (and should be disappeared because you have 'fascist leanings')"". Again, you live in a mature democracy. The boogeyman state is controlled by your representatives.

&gt;then I think you should be legally bound to be educated on why that's wrong at the very least. Think of it like community service, or those sensitivity courses they send bigots on sometimes.

So now we are talking actual reeducation camps. *Communist vibes intensify* Maybe when you said that I should not be allowed to be a part of ""democratic society"", you actually meant that I should be sent to a gulag.

&gt;Resist. Stop being a conformist. Realise that the state is merely part of an eco-system along with its people and its rich, and that the three should ideally keep eachother in check. Right now, the rich and the state are 69'ing eachother and the people are being dunked on by both.

This is always so ironic with people like you. You talk about ""uniting against the rich"", but all you do is divide.

595,"Thank you for pointing out the images do not work. I fixed it.

The three reforms I chose were picked on basis of realism, current framework design and inherent need. They are not really ambitious, but they are vital, each of them attune a downside of the currency union. I was looking at what would offer overall better macroeconomic policy for the area, recovery tools that would make euro more resilient during shocks and lastly, convergence amplifier to combat last 25 year of increasing economic polarization.

Varoufakis was right, but the timing was wrong. The austerity supporters could hide under ever-increasing globalization which brought foreign demand for the goods they exported. This masked the real problem of depressed demand across EU, which Varoufakis rightly pointed out would make the debt servicing harder, unemployment higher and growth slower.

European leaders turned a blind eye, and pointed out the recovery they enjoyed, which was then attempted to be replicated across EU(think of big push to be more competitive Troika had).

Now the problem is what happens when globalism is not progressing like it did at the start of the millennium, as we are seeing now. I doubt there will be another situation where Chinese borrow trillions to boost consumption. Then you cannot ignore the problems your domestic market suffers because of structural reforms and prolonged fiscal consolidation. Suddenly, a healthy demand in Eurozone will be imperative for every single members future.

This should push politicians to reform the Euro. Germans are starting to understand it, at least that is how it seems with the lastest recovery fund.",Slovenian in Canada,/r/europe/comments/i0ijzz/euro_under_the_microscope_fragility_convergence/fzstkn0/,Joko11,1596149500

He lost the election in 1932, but his party ended up with the largest percentage of the votes in the parliament. I don't think it's honest to say he seized power. His party was elected and Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor in order to gain favor with his party.

669,"&gt; The entire army was in complete chaos

And whose fault was that?

No, they did not need to reorganize to declare war. War was already ongoing, the Germans did not wait for Littlesaber to make official declarations, instead he wasted time and the lives of his soldiers.

&gt; Oh, he should have committed suicide, right. Well, let's see: committing suicide is against all laws of self-conservation, unless you have brain problems. If you don't have them, then pointing a gun at your head and pressing the trigger is something your brain would like to avoid.

I don't think that men like Colonel Giovanni Faccin and General Felice Caperdoni had brain problems. And they bore far less guilt for what was happening than Littlesaber.

&gt; at least he knew how to avoid a civil war in the 20's

Nope, there wouldn't have been a civil war. The Army would have obeyed, the fascists crushed in a few days.

&gt; and, during WW2, how to uphold legitimacy for the country.

How to save his own ass.

&gt; but you can't really blame the Government for suppressing rebels, which is something countries have been doing since, uhm... the dawn of time. 

And indeed, I despise all governments that repressed legitimate protests. Your ""rebels"" were unarmed citizens protesting the increase in the price of food. I wish there had really been an armed rebellion, maybe a bullet could have found its way to bava beccaris or vigoni.

&gt; Also the city of Milan gave him a medal you know? Quite ironic if you think about it.

Nope, not at all. The *mayor* of Milan, who only represented the upper class (universal suffrage was still a long way to come...), did that. The Milanese people would have given him many, many things, but a medal wasn't one of them.

&gt; When Bresci fired his gun, if it hadn't been for the Carabinieri who drag him away, he would have been beaten and stoned by the crowd who was cheering for the King in Monza.

Kings and other despots tend to surrounds themselves with crowds of supporters when they make public appearances, since the dawn of history as you say. That's not a sample of the general population.

&gt; Even before the passing of the ""Regicidio"" law, major anarchists groups and far-left movements actually showed love for the dead king, with many of them condemning the act and actually saying ""we loved more him than we knew"". Beacuse of Bresci's act people were so scared and stressed from what happened in Monza that when an alpini's horse during the funeral started to misbehave, people began shouting ""Anarchists! Anarchist!"" and running away as they were shitting their pants for another terrorist attack. 

Source, century-old monarchist propaganda.

&gt; Bresci wanted to kill the institution of the monarch, but what he actually ended up doing was reinforcing it by killing Umberto I in an act of terror causing the destabilization of the country.

On the contrary. The decade following Umberto's assassination was the best in the history of the Kingdom of Italy.",Lombardy,/r/europe/comments/hzzu9h/on_29_july_1900_this_day_120_years_ago_italys/fzswbf7/,Lavrentio2LaVendetta,1596150841

The campaign was for information, but because the federal structure of Germany, even the smaller counties can make such a thing mandatory. And Jena was just faster ...   and, after they made masks mandatory and informed all, the number of new-infections went to zero.

Now there was only one Jena... so they also looked at other towns and counties. And there it was also shown that the masks definitely reduced the spread of the virus.

797,"&gt; What baffles us is that we are accused of ""underpaying"", i.e.not meeting these 2%....which we are to meet by 2024, and for which we are now ""sanctioned"".

The original 2% pledge was made in [2006](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/02/16/military-spending-by-nato-members), and had to be renegotiated in 2014 since Europe didn't bother meeting what they agreed to meet. [Merkel has already stated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/11/08/germany-finally-pledges-increase-military-spending-nato-levels-trump-still-wont-be-happy/) that Germany won't meet that threshold by 2024 either.

&gt; Which will now go to Italy and Belgium who both pay less than Germany in defense by % of GDP.

Right, where the headquarters of NATO is located (see my previous comment about building infrastructure).

&gt;And in spite of Germany as a hub having far more importance for the US itself

Again, if Germany doesn't care about NATO, the US needs to move the bases elsewhere.

&gt;If I had to find an analogy, it's like your landlord shouting at you daily for not having yet paid your rent that is due 6 months from now, to then finally disabling your AC, in January only. And then cannibalizing their own AC to repair the ACs for two other parties in the house who are actually late on rent.

That analogy conveniently omitted the tenet telling the landlord they won't be paying rent for another 6 years, after not paying for the previous 14 years.

This whole discussion boils down to this: if Germany (as well as others) do not think NATO is worth preserving, then why should the US? How can the US trust a country that can't even be trusted by its neighbors? And if Germany actually wants to be a part of NATO, why does it only seem interested when the other members start seeking alternatives?",,/r/europe/comments/i0bikx/us_to_pull_12000_troops_from_germany_after_trump/fzrd2kw/,Sypilus,1596135010

906,"&gt;Sure I agree, I just think that the current situation is simply sub-optimal. There is a lot of women who want to think for themselves be free independent etc but don't reach these goals because they are chained in a way by social expectations, seen as less intelligent etc. While there is also a lot of men who constantly feel useless, insecure and threatened. Because a lot of women, while having a disadvantage in upwards mobility kind of have like a big box of pillows to fall into if they fall. For example parents are more likely to financially help their daughters than sons. Also If youre mediocrely attractive woman you can almost always find a guy whose gonna sustain you even if you don't work. Not that they shouldn't have these options, but for men if you start falling you are kind of fucked. Even if your parents help you youre unlikely to find a partner or be seen as an acceptable member of society. And if nobody helps you then there is either homelessness, prison, suicide or in the best case military.

I agree completely and think that the solution then is to reach out to men, to help them out, to listen to them and hear them when they discuss their issues and to actually support them rather than just tell them to ""man up"" and calling them soyboys and other things, of which, as I already was clear about, both men *and* women are very guilty of. A lot of women are precisely the kind that will say that they are happy about guys opening up only to insult them and their masculinity.

&gt; This is very true but not as true in real life as internet makes you think. Especially as women age and become more rational. Also a lot of this is caused by this being the only option for upwards mobility for women in conservative societies.

That is true, those that have such standards do compromise when they get older but it's still not entirely - they don't entirely give up those goals and preferences, they maybe only slightly adjust them if it really seems like they can't reach them.

&gt; Why mothers, why not fathers? What is the rationale for assigning blame to exclusively women? Also if women ought to change how do we change them?

In this context, I was talking about women having to change their own attitudes as well, not just men or society at large. And as I said, I think it's through social attitudes and through changing culture. Culture has changed over the centuries in a number of ways and culture today is not at all like the culture in the 1700s or 1800s or heck, it's a lot different than even the 1950s or 1960s. Roles change, attitudes change, and what we have to do is instill and promote change through the education system, through the media and so on.

&gt;True since they are mostly women and its easier for them to identify with these issues, but it definitely shouldn't be like this. Feminists should recognize that a lot of their shit is never gonna get fixed if they never get men on the same page.

Agree.

&gt;Why tho? I don't really see how did you argue that feminism is overall bad for society. The fact that it fixes a lot of women's shit doesn't make it harmful to men. Sure it doesn't help men very much but this kind of thinking if I can't have good things then you can't have either is cancerous. Feminism has to change or we need a new movement to fix mens shit that actually fixes shit instead of being full of conservative misogynists (referring to ""men's rights"").

An ideology to me is not something one should necessarily *adhere* to. It's a tool to achieve your ideal society. An ideology is like using buses to get to your desired destination; there's no direct line from where you are to get to your desired destination, so you'll have to hop on one bus, then hop off it and get on another.

In this case, feminism served its purpose to bring women much, much closer to complete equality with men (in the Western world, that is - the rest of the world is a completely different story). What we should do now is replace feminism with a much bigger and more inclusive egalitarian movement, one which no longer focuses just on women (because it was understandable that 20th century feminism focused on women considering they were by far in a way, way, waaaaay worse position than men). 

What we should have now is a movement that seeks to fix the remaining problems that exist when it comes to gender equality and problems that both women and men face rather than focusing on women and solely from a women's perspective. And you can never make feminism not focus on women without completely changing the symbolism and rewriting priorities. It's called feminism, as I said, not egalitarianism. If it was called meninism or something, logically you'd expect it to be primarily about men. Feminism, if it wants to truly be an egalitarian movement that cares about men too, must either completely rebrand or transform into something brand new that doesn't have either gender in its name, or the symbol of Venus as the ideology's symbol, and that is completely inclusive and doesn't shut out male voices, as feminists, intentionally or unintentionally, seem to often be doing.

In case that is not possible, then leave feminism be but still create a separate men's rights movement, and both feminism and the men's rights movement would cooperate with each other rather than demonizing each other as it currently is now, with feminists calling MRAs incels and misogynists for expressing genuine and reasonable concerns, and the MRAs accusing feminists (or women in general, even) of wanting to destroy, exploit or kill all men.


&gt;I never claimed to ""lift anyone up"" my whole point is to liberate human beings from gender expectations as much as possible. And I find feminism somewhat of a useful tool to achieve this.

To me, it seems more like feminism doesn't promote the elimination of gender expectations, but rather seems to replace current gender expectations with new ones. Women are told to be masculine, ambitious and dominant, while men are lauded by the feminists for acting feminine, more emotional, weaker. That's bad to me. I believe gender expectations should completely be eliminated and neither women acting masculine nor men acting feminine should be promoted, nor should women acting feminine or men acting masculine.  

&gt;Yes but the source of these issues is wider society. And we can only change anything by letting these ideas be heard and understood.

Precisely why society has to change and to hear out men's voices and their issues and their qualms with the expectations society has of them, and *then* the issues will be resolved. It should stop telling men that their problems don't matter - many non-feminists will tell them how their problems are completely unreal, while the feminists will tell them they are but then talk about how it affects women instead.",Serbia (Belgrade),/r/europe/comments/hzyui6/young_irish_women_the_most_depressed_and_lonely/fzqun6l/,virbrevis,1596127894

By May 1915 it was already clear to everyone what was the nature of the war, and anyone with minimal knowledge of Italy's borders knew well than any advance would have been paid with insane casualties.

The Army was loyal, Sciaboletta was just a spineless coward, not to mention he thought he could use Musso to rid himself of those pesky workers who thought they had a right to better working and living conditions after being used as cannon fodder (the peasants)/seeing their masters get insanely rich through production of war supplies (factory workers).

&gt; Oh wait, but what about the King escaping to Brindisi? What a coward, right?

Yep.

&gt; He should have stayed in Rome with his family and the entire government to be captured by the Germans instead of setting up a government in Brindisi to continue the civil war, 

I like how you added the family and the government to make your argument work. Had he not been the spineless coward he was, he should have abdicated, sent his son south as the new king with the government, and remained in Rome to pay for his mistakes in the only possible way - with his life. Instead, being the spineless coward he was, and only caring about himself, he fled, without even warning several members of said government, and resisted all attempts at being put aside.

&gt; to continue the civil war, trying to eradicate fascism from Italy and present himself as the true Italian state in the peninsula to the eyes of the entire world! 

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! Jeez, I am amazed there is somebody around that actually takes for granted the bullshit that you say. First, Littlesaber and ""eradicating fascism"" don't belong in the same sentence. Even after arresting Mussolini, for two months, all he and his cronies did was to change names and other facade things, without doing anything to make Italy more democratic; they perfectly liked the dictatorship they had created, they simply had to replace the dictator. They did not even destroy the documents that listed all Italian Jews with their addresses which had been prepared after the racial laws, documents that greatly helped the Nazis in rounding them up afterwards. And Littlesaber even regretting having to lose such a good servant as Mussolini, who had served him so well for many years, as he lamented privately. Secondly, Littlesaber refused to declare war on Germany for over a month after the Armistice, despite being pressured by the Allies and being well aware that this state of things allowed the Germans to ignore the Geneva convention when dealing with Italian troops, who when resisted could be regarded as unlawful combatants thanks to the lack of a state of war. That poor excuse of a man did not even want to give up his title as emperor of Ethiopia, despite his 'empire' having been all but lost two years earlier! How much consideration did the entire world give to his 'true state', is clearly shown by the 1947 peace treaty. Italy was treated as a defeated enemy, nothing more, nothing less.

&gt; He should have been captured along with his entire government, family and heir to the throne in order to give complete legitimacy to Mussolini's government in the north! 

As I already said. Abdicate. Send King Umberto II south with the legitimate government. Stay in Rome as the former king and die to atone for the shit you did, leading the resistance against the Germans or committing suicide if you are afraid of being captured and used as some sort of figurehead by the man you allowed to rule the country for twenty years, as long as it suited to you. Better men than him committed suicide out of shame after the Armistice. But Littlesaber did not know shame, or honor, or atonement. All he cared for was his useless skin.

The real difference to this is that ""europlug"" is used in schuko or other recessed socket and the specifications demanded that it has plastic pins with metal tip. US plug really doesn't have that requirement even now and UK is the same thin: full metal pins used on a non-recessed sockets is still too common.

By telling people to shut up we don't actualy change their minds, we don't actualy convince people to stop beeing facist by censoring them. All we get os for them to hide their opinions from us, wich reduces our chances of talking them out peacefully to virtualy zero

The only way to convince people not to follow these extreme ideologies is to openly debate them and expose their flaws for all to see, it won't be 100% perfect, nothing is, but it's better than the alternative of having them hide their opinions until they decide to do something insane

The costs to pay for censorship are allways too high. It's extremely difficult to determine what is ""acceptable"" speech, with missfires beeing almost by design. Even today, without any formal censorship, people already missclassify their political oponents, the original man punched by ""punch a nazy"" wasan't actualy a nazi

Yes, the UK has asked for an expansion of the EU’s equivalence system (mostly not in terms of access, but in terms of reliability, so companies can have some guarantee of consistency).

&gt;Are you just playing stupid? You called me a ""progressive"" and explained ""we"" hate your mysterious traditional values

You *do* hate them though.

&gt;The list I made consists of topics pretty common for progressives for many decades.

Sure. The list you made is also completely off topic, except for ""gays"" at the very beginning of it.

&gt;Ah, okay, you are just a crazy manic, fantasizing about a fear hard to grasp when you are not a brainwashed extremist.

I live in a country where my political views are centrist to centre-right, and I would rather keep it this way. Keep your leftward-shifted political spectrum away.

&gt;You and the people of the taliban and ISIS have really much in common.

So do you and Stalinists, but worry not, if modern progressives and Stalinists were the only two remaining ideologies, there would be enough to fight over. And the same would be the case there.

&gt;And I will soon stop ""harassing"" you little crybully. 

As a precaution, I don't generally post on the internet using my real world personal data, on the minuscule chance the plague of western 'cancel culture' reaches our country one day.

&gt;Your worldview really only knows friends or foes

Pot calling the kettle black xD

&gt;You seem do live in a cage of absurd fictional fear

This cage is called ""reading mainstream reddit subreddits, and treating the discussions being had there as an accurate description of how the political views of a significant portion of people in the west are, and how their countries operate"". And I'm sorry to say that, but it is presenting a model I wouldn't wish for my country to emulate even in a million years.

&gt;So, gay people are not beaten up on a regular base in Poland

Not in the amount that would make it any noticeably different from straight people being beaten up in Poland. It's a country of 38 million people, somebody is gonna to be beaten up from time to time, and sometimes such person will happen to be gay.

Looked up criminal statistics for assault in EU, and Poland is around average. Are you now implying that in other EU countries only straight people are being assaulted, while everyone except for Poland gay people are mysteriously spared that fate?

&gt;Pride Parades not being crushed by neonazis, if approved by local authorities anyway?

Using an extreme example, neo-nazi parades in Germany - if approved by local authorities - usually have 10 times as sizable counterdemonstrations, and sometimes they get violent too. The beauty of democracy though is that if you disagree with someone's views, you can protest them too.

Well, in case of Poland, many people disagree with whatever pride parades are trying to promote, and organize counterprotests. If pride parades are organized in conservative towns, it's far from surprising that there will be more counterprotesters than supporters, through the exact same mechanism it's far from surprising that in liberal German towns there are more anti-nazi protesters, than neo-nazis.

&gt;Your police is never harrasing queer people? 

Are you now referring to that one case a week or two ago, where an LGBT activist has commited theft and vandalism, posted evidence all over their social media, and then when police came with an arrest warrant, refused to obey orders while being arrested? I would hardly call that ""harrasment"".

&gt;I think you have no idea how soulcrushing it is to be gay in a country like yours

1275,"A Tory peer has sparked anger after declaring that Britons caught out by the Spain quarantine changes should “accept the consequences” of booking a break “for pleasure” in a pandemic and should not be given any extra state help.

Baroness Buscombe, a former welfare minister, used an emergency Lords question on the row to criticise calls for fresh financial support to be given to workers forced to self-isolate for 14 days on return from holiday.

But she was quickly accused of “blaming the public” for Boris Johnson’s chaotic handling of foreign travel arrangements between the UK and elsewhere.

Thousands of holidaymakers have had their plans disrupted after the government gave just a few hours’ notice on Saturday that it was imposing a blanket quarantine requirement on everyone coming back from Spain.

On Monday, travellers were also told not to jet out to the Canary and Balearic Islands, even though the main sharp rise in Covid-19 cases has taken place in and around Catalonia on the mainland.

Labour, trade unions and other parties have all called for enhanced statutory sick pay to be made available to workers hit by the changes, but Baroness Buscombe was scathing.

“The trouble with Labour and the Liberal Democrats is they love spending other people’s money,” she said.

“They complain about austerity and then want to spend yet more of taxpayers’ money on people who have chosen to take risks by travelling mostly for pleasure in the middle of a worldwide pandemic.

“Perhaps we should change the word ‘pandemic’ to ‘plague’... Isn’t it time to stop treating everyone as if they are incapable of taking proportionate risks and accepting the consequences?”

Buscombe, a former chair of the defunct Press Complaints Commission, then praised ministers for ”doing absolutely the right thing” in acting swiftly to impose quarantine on travellers from Spain.

In answer, transport minister Baroness Vere replied: “I’d like to thank my noble friend for her comments.

“And of course to a certain extent she is right, whenever one travels during a pandemic or otherwise there are always risks that are simply not present when one is at home. And so at the moment with the pandemic the risks are much higher.”

Baroness Vere stressed that the risks of travel could be “mitigated” with the right travel insurance and by booking with firms that offered flexibility to change the booking.

The minister had earlier said that some people may be eligible for Universal Credit if they face difficulties with employers refusing to pay their wages while they self-isolate on returning from abroad.

The row comes just a day after health minister Lord Bethell was accused of “blaming the poor” for their own deaths from coronavirus.

He had said that the disproportionate death rates were partly down to “the decisions that people make about social distancing, about their own health decisions…”

Labour’s shadow Lords leader Baroness Smith was furious at Buscombe’s comments and at the minister’s apparent endorsement.

“I was appalled by Baroness Buscombe’s comments but the minister really should have pulled her up on such deeply offensive views,” she told HuffPost UK.

“Blaming the public for the government’s own actions will seem deeply unfair to many.”

Earlier, during her urgent private notice question relayed via video link, Smith had told the Lords: “The government has really failed to understand the practicalities and the financial impact of self-isolation.”

The government advice to encourage employers to be “understanding” of those hit by the quarantine was “just not acceptable – and it is also totally irresponsible”, Smith said.

“She and I are working from home today but for millions of people, usually in the lowest paid jobs, that just isn’t possible. Even if employers are ‘understanding’, their landlords and others may not be. Pricing people out of self-isolation is dangerous – for all of us.”

Transport minister Grant Shapps decided to break his own holiday in Spain on Monday, leaving his family in the country while he travelled back to help coordinate further government action.

Boris Johnson said on Tuesday that the UK must be “vigilant” about threat of a second wave of coronavirus in Europe.

However, he refused to rule out changing the quarantine rules to reduce the 14-day period to 10 days with the right kind of testing.

When asked whether ‘regional travel corridors’ could be introduced, Baroness Vere also gave further clues to possible changes to the rules in coming days.

She said: “For the time being we are taking the approach by country for border measures.

“But it is the case that it could be that we could put them in place for regions in the future. We are not there yet, but we are certainly looking at it because it is an appropriate consideration.”

Tory peer Lord Hayward had also asked whether a new 40-minute covid test could be deployed at airports to avoid unnecessary self-isolation and loss of earnings on return.

“We are considering options to look at ways we can manage the risk of imported cases. We are looking at testing people on certain days...Obviously we would like to decrease the number of days in self-isolation if we possibly can.”",,/r/europe/comments/i0k1vi/tory_peer_says_brits_holidaying_in_spain_should/fzpubvt/,casualphilosopher1,1596106790

1302,"Because its a repots ... I post my original answer \^\^

 

First ... the easy things, I think.

&gt;By  contrast, the main German concern was to forestall the threat of   deutschmark strength as undermining German competitiveness within   Europe. Currency overvaluation stands in conflict with Germany’s   export-led growth model.

Youve  got a source for this? Because the German export companies helped the  Euro way bigger than the Deuschte Mark. For the German economy the Euro  is way underpriced and so promoting the German exports in the global  market.

However, there were  conncerns that a common currency would hurt German economy, if it would  adapt the stance of the central banks of Southern Europe.

But  the recent years, more and more economists start to worry, about the  Euro and the competitiveness of German companies. Because the Deutsche  Mark, was a key influence to establish technological advanced products,  otherwise German companies couldnt hope to compete on the global market  with their goods.

&gt;With  the option of devaluation foreclosed and the absence of any  union-wide  industrial policy aimed at uplifting exports in periphery,   technological dependency and over-indebtedness became inevitable.

You  are right about this. Of course, not only Germany, but the general  point is right. There was a hugh inbalance between the economies of the  countries participating in the Euro from the start.

Germany,  for example, had very competitive products for the world market. As you  say, this inbalance was solved before from other countries by making  this products more expansive than the homemade ones.

This  possibility now gone, German and other export nations did profit from  the Euro introduction very much. An inherent flaw, from the beginning of  the project.

&gt;Thus,  governments are at mercy of often ‘irrational” market sentiments  which  can trigger abrupt stops in the funding of the government debt, \[...\]

To  put your point more bland ... you are mistrusting the 'irrational'  markets and think, that a political stance on debsts is 'rational'.

You think, that if a country want to make debst, a central bank should just print money for them, and dont need to be controled.

Because  thats basically what you are saying. If a country want to make debts  (it dont have to), than someone giving a loan, want a risk premium  besides of their profit. The profit, is pretty much the same for an  investor, regardless if Germany or Italy gets the money. But the risk  premium differs.

So its not the  'irrational' markets here. They set an incentive, to keep control over  the debts of a country over the risk premium. A political controlled  central bank on the other hand, couldnt set such incentive, and would  need other control (which I think, wont be better).

&gt;One  also has to take into account that the European Central Banks  independence is the reason why the risk of default even exists for  member states.

Maybe you want to look into Argentinia for this one. If I counted right, they face their 9th default now, and are not part of a common currency.

However to the other issue implied I want to citate wiki ...

* There  is very strong consensus among economists that an independent  central  bank can run a more credible monetary policy, making market   expectations more responsive to signals from the central bank. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank#Independence)

I now, that for you, this isnt a valid point, as it is just because of the 'irrational' markets, but I leave it for now at this.

Now the more complicated issues, the reforms .... and to start with, there need to be reforms to the Eurozone without doubt.

* \[...\]  the Eurosystem shall also ""support the general economic policies in the   Union with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives   of the Union"". These include inter alia ""full employment"" and  ""balanced  economic growth"". [Source](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/intro/objective/html/index.en.html)
* \[...\]  the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Union with a   view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Union   as laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union. [Source](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A12016E127)

Yes,  the main goal of the ECB is to keep a stable inflation, or stable  prices in general. But it isnt their only purpose. And every economist  knows this.

&gt;A monetary union can only function if there is a collective mechanism of mutual support and control.

It is really nice, that you put together the idea of Eurobonds this way.

* The  ESM’s mission is to provide financial assistance to euro area   countries experiencing or threatened by severe financing problems. [Source](https://www.esm.europa.eu/assistance/lending-toolkit)

So  basically what you are asking for, it already implmented. A system of  mutual support and control. Now I know, that Eurobonds is something  different. But thats why I said, I really liked how you put it in your  text.

The data from the survey in question has later become known as the Nordic paradox: the countries with the highest measured gender equality (based on several factors) are the ones with the highest IPVAW (Intimate partner violence against women) in Europe.

Researchers are trying to figure out why this is the case, but as of now there is no consensus. Possible explanations are:

1) the nordics are just more violent towards women. However, this doesn't really come through in other statistics (eg. The view of violence against women, view and prevalence of violence in general)

2) the so-called backlash effect: several studies dating as far back as the 70s have pointed out that successful, well-educated women (ie. those that defy stereotypes) are more likely to be the victim of IPVAW. But other studies again have refuted this data.

3) general alcohol and substance abuse. But again, other countries score higher here but still have considerably less violence towards women.

4) reporting error: of you pretext the survey with ""violence against women"", you will often filter the question with this in the back of your head. In other words, you will probably answer differently to the question ""have you ever been pushed"" if you know it's about violence or not.

1386,"I don't think this statistic is useless. I think this is a possible measure for tension between different land-use types. E.g. in the Netherlands it is very hard/near impossible to find a piece of land that has not been claimed already for one or even multiple purposes and changing land-use is hard because the necessity for one land-use type over another needs to be governed out. This means that low-value land-use types like landfills are unlikely (old land-fills in the Netherlands are often covered and used as natural/recreation area). Compare this to countries where GDP per land area is smaller and you will find those land-fills to be more likely on land.  Another example for the Netherlands is that instead of expanding the Rotterdam harbour internally into the old Maasvlakte with new channels, it decided to build a whole new peninsula (called the second Maasvlakte) to expand the harbour, I don't believe this would be done if much more land was still readily available.

1393,"I'm curious what makes people call Edward VIII a degenerate.

I certainly hope it wouldn't be due to him muddying the blood of the royal family by marrying an American divorcee...God forbid such a travesty as that would occur with the coupling of the royals with inferior people's...

I mean the other things he is known for is trying to make the monarch more active in helping policies, especially for the poor, something about not liking the way his face looked on a coin, and the belief that British people should not die for the sake of Europe if it wasn't in Britain's interest.

But I for one am really curious where Edward becomes a degenerate because I encounter it a lot perusing history reddits.  The more I read about him, the more I find he was immature and rash, but his main crime was wanting to marry an American divorcee which... doesn't seem that controversial to me. 

Relevant to Churchill it is Doubly so as the plan was to not have her children be placed in line to the throne, preventing legal issues with succession and the muddying of the royal line

 This is what Churchill wrote a letter in support of that you criticize as idiotic.  The only reason the issue existed was the barbaric practice of forbidding remarriage by the Protestant faith, and it would be seen as bad form to have the head of the church defy church policy. (Even though it is argued the marriage was the act that helped to soften the stance on said policy. It was at the time unheard of for remarriage following divorce, now it is common)

I mean if we are still okay with calling that degenerative and unforgivable  behavior in 2020 like it was then, where the British government on the basis of backing the church of england forced him to abdicate the monarchy because it was so unconscionable, then I guess he is Edward the VIII the degenerate, but it just seems weird to me his name is always mentioned as if he was disgusting.

For additional thought, he remained married till he died, and they are buried together.",,/r/europe/comments/i068kp/on_this_day_29_july_1962_fascist_oswald_mosley/fzpf95x/,deathsdentist,1596091819

And these areas cover almost a third of Poland's surface area. 

This does not sound the same as ""proclaiming they are not planning to teach LGBT in sex ed"", this sounds like willful division of a country's populace by making sexual preferences of others dependant on ""ideology"" instead of their nature, therefore making them easier to oppress because then their way of life is simply their own choice, and so are the consequences.

I wonder how it would feel to have areas, say, called white-free zones if you were white, areas whose existence would be defended as a simple matter regarding over-representation of white culture in history classes, denying any consequences that result from said ""simple matter"".

Also, the Wikipedia article I'm quoting tells that people's attitudes towards LGBT -minorities have only improved in the polls, while the policies and rhetoric have worsened, which gives credence to the top-&gt;bottom -theory.

""At a rally ahead of European Parliament elections in May, PiS president Jaroslaw Kacynski told a crowd that ""LGBT ideology"" was a ""threat"" to Polish society.""

What is the use of such a policy? Leverage, plain and simple, to try to force Poland more in line with EU's preferred ideology.

Estonian net wage is also around 40% higher than in Latvia and Lithuania and for the past 5 years, it has meant that Estonia has become relatively attractive for migrants from Ukraine, Russia and Moldova. 40% difference in wage when living costs are 20% higher may not make much of a difference for an Estonian that lives here permanently, but does make a difference to a temporary worker, who lives frugally, saves up and then returns to home country where prices are much lower.",,/r/europe/comments/i02arb/population_change_of_european_countries_between/fzp9mr8/,sanderudam,1596087010

1634,"&gt;I don't recall saying anything about assassinations.
&gt;Was it right that Alan Turing was chemically castrated, and why?

I don't recall saying anything about that homosexuality should be illegal and what the ""appropriate"" punishments are.

&gt;A) What's a ""Proper Democracy"", and who has the right to decide whether or not a country is a ""proper democracy""?

Does the UK have rule of law or does it not? Is there significant disenfranchisement in the UK? Does the UK have freedom of speech? Is it reasonably possible to become a lawmaker in the UK? Don't be disingenuous. You know full well that it is absurd to justify political violence in a liberal democracy such as the UK or the rest of Western Europe. Why even have democracy and the rule of law at all if violence is the way we should resolve things and be ruled according to you?

&gt;B) How can you start a peaceful movement when it the state, that which you oppose, that has the right to determine what is, and what is not, violent?

This is some postmodernist ""there is no such thing as the objective truth"" nonsense. No reasonable person is going to say that people marching with signs and chanting without so much as touching anyone else is ""violent"" and that throwing rocks at people's heads and punching them in the face is not. The law is perfectly clear. What is also clear is that you have never even attempted to learn anything about the laws of your country, about its political model or its principles, instead you have been drinking the koolaid.

&gt;The Rule of Law is Might Makes Right. It simply cedes all the might to the State.

No, it is not. The law protects and punishes everyone equally. And stop pretending that the ""State"" is some kind of opaque, shadowy and all-powerful entity over which you have zero control.

1740,"&gt;“I literally can’t tell the difference between them!” - that’s you right there right now you realize that right?

No, that is your straw man. And the far left has a little bit more extreme and nuanced opinions than being opposed to people advocating for genocide. And I think you know that and are just being disingenuous once again.

&gt;Now what kinds of things are the far left intolerant of?

Everyone they deem to be an ""oppressor"". It's starting to kind of remind me of communists being intolerant of everyone they deemed to be ""exploitative capitalists"" ...and then all those ""exploitative capitalists"" (including intellectuals who did not agree with them, doctors, teachers etc.) ended up in mass graves. Huh... weird how that happened. Almost like ideological extremists being given a license to use violence against everyone they disagree with and deem to be ""evil"" is actually really fucking dangerous.

What do you think is going to happen when you give the far left a license to engage in violence against anyone they deem the enemy? What is going to happen when every white person who does not agree with them 100% becomes the ""enemy""? And then ironically you are talking about how we should not wait until it is too late to say that extremism is unacceptable. But it is only a very specific kind of extremism that is unacceptable according to you, right? Again, ask yourself why Baader-Meinhof was banned.

&gt;What do you think benefits a fascist more: allowing them to march through the streets freely with their banners and signs and whatnot or not allowing them to do that?

You are ignoring what I said, yet again. Yes, I think that them marching through the streets and mostly being ignored (maybe a small peaceful counter protest, especially if there are a lot of minorities in the area) is better than them becoming national news because of clashes breaking out and them being beaten half to death in front of the cameras. Because people watching the news are going to see nonviolent people being beaten half to death by ideological extremists otherwise and that cannot be beneficial to the cause.

My second thought was that few people will have lived in many many countries in Europe and each of their experiences will have been different.

It's hard to objectively direct another without knowing them quite well.

One consideration if your a nurse might be language though. Ireland or the UK would make sense for most native English speaking nurses who wanted to work in this profession in Europe.

There are limitations to be dealt with as well as just recommendations I suppose.

Maybe you should take a trip and just visit a few regions. Interrailing is a popular choice for many younger visitors.

Good luck with your decision making. Its a big choice. I will say that the toughest move you will ever make will be moving home again. I've lived in a few countries and moved back to Ireland recently. Reverse culture shock is a motherfucker.

1758,"Russia has oil and has as leverage while the EU pays good money for those resources. The EU needs these to keep its energy needs going at a relatively cheap price. The Gulf States have large amounts of oil we could use for energy but the problem there is that it costs a lot of money to move very valuable goods through pretty unstable countries. Nobody is building a pipeline from Saudi Arabia through Israel and Syria isn't exactly the most friendly country for investment right now. So Russia holds a massive bargaining tool over Europe. A tool that's slowly becoming less relevant though with the increasing amount of renewables in the EU so in due time, the EU will not need Russia's energy resources.

The USA is the closest ally one could possibly get. Europe is a massive market for American goods and services, an ideological ally in most ways, and of very high strategic importance to them given that Russia is right next to it. The only real issue in the relationship comes up when a ""stable genius"" is elected in the US and doesn't act in the US' best interest. Europe's and America's interests align so I wouldn't say we're their bitch. We rely on them for defence for a large part but it allows us to focus our money elsewhere.

China... Well, China is a hard one. China has lots and lots of money to invest into foreign projects. Things like their Belt and Road Initiative have resulted in them investing large amounts of money into European countries like Portugal and Greece where they invest in infrastructure like ports and railroads and create jobs. This in turn causes those countries to defend their own interests in the EU. Those interests then tend to be ""keep the Chinese money coming in."" And so the EU because of it's structure is unable to do anything since it needs unanimous votes to act on things like this. China is growing it's soft power all over the world and in Europe while the main counter to them is bogged down with a president that is convinced he is winning a geopolitical struggle and keeps his country busy with scandal after scandal. 

Turkey in my opinion doesn't have much influence over the EU. Yes, it managed to get some stuff for stopping the flow of migrants into Europe but the EU can cope with all the migrants itself if there was a will/need to. Europe, again is a large market and massively wealthy economy for Turkey to tap into. Turkey wants money from tourists and European businesses. If the EU decided to revoke the privileges it gave to Turkey and let the migrants back in to deal with them itself, it would be a loss for Turkey. Outisde of that Turkey is also a valuable strategic ally against Russia. Nothing would terrify Russia more than a united NATO to the west and the south. 

The EU's issues in my opinion mostly stem from its shortcomings. The ability of single states to block anything the council proposes and a large amount of fake narratives about its actual workings. People think they have no voice in the EU, yet they can vote for parliament and vote for their own governments to represent them in the council. The EU is used as a scapegoat by populist politicians when they fall short at home, creating things like Brexit. The EU needs reform to it can actually throw it's geopolitical weight behind issues like the dependency on Russian energy resources, dependency on American defence, and growing Chinese soft power.

If we stand up to Iran together, this gives our alliance and trade relationship justification and strength. So, if Iran does anything in the region with their paramilitary elements (think Yemen and Iraq), we need to use our military to retaliate for the sake of supporting Saudi/UAE. To support operations in this region, we require safe haven bases in extremely stable locations away from conflict zones. That's one reason the European bases are so important, logistical support for MENA and Central Asian operations.

2045,"Lol, what a load of bullshit. 

No, it's not just about men and the women are at fault as well for perpetuating norms that disregard men and treat them effectively as if they weren't human beings. It is often women who tell men to open up about their emotions, only to shame them and treat them as if they weren't real men. It is women who perpetuate social roles harmful towards men too, and it's not just men who have to change their behavior and worldview. 

And feminism does *not* do anywhere near enough to help men out with their problems, and in addition to that, they tend to view all male problems from a female perspective, as if they hurt women first and foremost and men only second.

2115,"&gt;Russians are not in a position to lecture Europeans about what is civilized. 

Are you a Nazi? Russians are exactly the same people as you or someone else. And no one has the right to keep silent or ignore them. As I said: discussion is civilization, and censoring, dividing people into castes is the Middle Ages mentality.  


&gt; Not after Novichok and the numerous other assassinations abroad and within Russia. 

Dude. Russian is a nationality. But any manifestation of political struggle is politics. People of Russian nationality are not responsible for the actions of politicians in the same way as every idiotic Trump statement cannot be extrapolated to all Americans. Considering that you do not focus on politicians, but on nationality, I will once again ask my question: are you a Nazi?  


&gt; With the exeception of 2 or 3 cities, infrastructure in Russia is so decrepit that the country hardly looks civilized.  

Regardless of your opinion about the quality of infrastructure in Russian cities, when we are talking about the ideological aspect of civilization, to transfer the conversation to infrastructure is a manipulation. The Russian economy really has problems at the moment, but these are economic problems, not civilizational. Shit can be found anywhere. The Parisian or New York's subway, for example, in comparison with the Moscow one look like garbage, but this does not mean that the inhabitants of Moscow are more civilized than the inhabitants of those two cities, right? Either considering that Russia still flies into space and has a functioning space program and technologies, while, for example, Germany hasn't means that Germany is less civilized in your opinion. Right?

&amp;#x200B;

You take an aspect that is convenient for you and extrapolate it to another, inconvenient environment as an example. You are a manipulator and this is unworthy.

Moreover, regarding the urban infrastructure, there is a place for discussion and I could argue with your statement, but given your manipulative inclinations, it is useless.  


&gt; Not to mention the shocking levels of alcoholism 

According to the [World Health Organization for the 2016-2018 observation year](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A1036), the average Russian consumed about **11.2** liters of alcohol. While the average Englishman is **11.5** and the average Frenchman is **12.3**. I understand it’s hard for you to believe it, considering the number of stereotypes in your head, but the level of alcohol consumption has dropped dramatically over the past 15 years and is now even lower than some European countries that you would never dare to call ""uncivilized"".  


&gt; and the gangs of neonazi thugs. 

All the life I have lived in Russia and have not yet met a single one. Did you read about it on the news or did you invent it yourself? Radical organizations are prohibited and if you knew at least a little the history of Russia, you would know what approximately \~28 million Soviet people died in WWII, you would never have said such nonsense, because Nazism in Russian society is unacceptable under any guise. Every family has ancestors who died in the fight against it. And even those few radical organizations from the 90s about that you may have heard either disbanded long ago and their members live a normal family life or went to jail many years ago.

2136,"&gt; So, leaving world police role/economic-military dominance to...China and Russia?

Russia isn't achieving economic-military dominance any time soon, their GDP is smaller than Brazil's these days, and they are hopelessly outmatched by the EU in economic strength, population size, and technological development. Germany + France + Italy outnumber Russia in manpower already, and Germany alone has a stronger and more complex economy.

China is scary sure, but what are US troops in Germany going to do about that? Obama began the American re-alignment away from Europe and towards Asia exactly because China is becoming the bigger priority. The USA actually is reworking its military to better suit conditions in the Pacific region (they recently began re-organizing the Marine Corps for that reason), and economically it has been growing hostile towards China (Huawei polemics, tariffs, and the whole TPP deal). American soldiers in Germany won't do much to assist Taiwan, Korea, or Japan.

&gt;""we shouldn't give a shit who invades who and who kills who, let them solve it themsleves"" ?

Well.. there is also that sentiment, but is it really a bad one? ""Should have let them solve it between themselves"" is the popular opinion regarding the Vietnam War after all.

* During the decade of 2000–2010, artificial blood was transfused into research subjects across the United States without their consent by Northfield Labs. Later studies showed the artificial blood caused a significant increase in the risk of heart attacks and death. 

* In August 2010, the U.S. weapons manufacturer Raytheon announced that it had partnered with a jail in Castaic, California in order to use prisoners as test subjects for its Active Denial System that ""fires an invisible heat beam capable of causing unbearable pain.The device, dubbed ""pain ray"" by its critics, was rejected for fielding in Iraq due to Pentagon fears that it would be used as an instrument of torture

* In 1967, the U.S. Army paid Kligman to apply skin-blistering chemicals to the faces and backs of inmates at Holmesburg, in Kligman's words, ""to learn how the skin protects itself against chronic assault from toxic chemicals, the so-called hardening process

* A 1953 article in the medical/scientific journal Clinical Science described a medical experiment in which researchers intentionally blistered the skin on the abdomens of 41 children, who ranged in age from 8 to 14, using cantharide. The study was performed to determine how severely the substance injures/irritates the skin of children. 

* In 1963, University of Washington researchers irradiated the testicles of 232 prisoners to determine the effects of radiation on testicular function. When these inmates later left prison and had children, at least four of them had offspring born with birth defects.

 The heavy selection of Catholicism on the census could be put down to any number of reasons:

1) Up until recently children needed to be baptised to get into Catholic run national schools, so you had a generation of non practicing parents baptise there kids.
2) There's no thide or church tax like some other EU countries that make us actively remove ourselves
3) The situation in the north, you were Catholic or Protestant,  one or the other, Just cause you didn't practice,  you were still in the group.
4) Laziness, it's what was put down the last time, why change, regardless of whether you practice or not.

2361,"Story time! I'm originally from Brazil. Moved to Sweden, studied, worked, met my lovely wife from Norrland (North of Sweden). Anyway, her mom is used to the cold life of the North and me coming from a warm country, I listen to a lot of her advice. 

Except a couple of years ago where we got an incredibly warm summer. Since the Sun barely sets up here, the heat was constant. 35C (95F) most days. Now, my MIL always kept the windows closed to not let the cold air in. Which is smart of course, except this summer, she had the same idea but in reverse. Don't open any windows to not let the heat in. This was the one and only fight I ever had with my MIL. She refused to accept the idea of letting the windows open to circulate air. The concept of the sun shining through the windows and hearing up the place was foreign to her. It took me to get both my wife, wife's sister and her kids to convince grandma to listen to me because that's how elderly folk die of heatstroke even in Brazil. Let alone a home that is built insulated for -30C (-22F) Winters. 

I bought her a thermometers that show the temp both inside and outside for her to see that her living room was at 39C (102F) with damp hot air.

2374,"""TRNC"" needs to decide if it is a seperate state as it claims or part of RoC. Cause if it is a seperate state it is entitled to exactly 0% of natural resources south of Cyprus unless you want to tell me that the areas SOUTH of Cypurs are the rightful EEZ of the so called Turkish Republic of NORTHERN Cyprus?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If you read the UN clauses, it is decided that Turkish Cypriots should benefit from the natural resources equally.

UN clauses specify (and both sides agree) that both communities should benefit but it doesn't say anything about half of the profits going to ""TRNC"" or how or when this will happen. Also equally is not 50-50 obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Since, Greek government is not willing to share the resources with Turkish Cypriots in the island

That's incorrect. Since RoC is the only recognised legal entity representing both communities, the President has said numerous times that the part of the profits that belongs to the Turkish Cypriots will be stored in a seperate account and given to them after a solution is reached. You cannot expect RoC to fund ""TRNC"" and also it depends to the type of the solution reached. If a two state solution (as Turkey seems to favor recently) is the outcome then the Turkish Cypriot state will not be entitled to any profits from resources south of Cyprus.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Turkish Cypriots gave Turkey a permission to search for natural gas. If Greeks are willing to share the gas with Turkish Cypriots, Turkey will give half of the gas to Greek Cypriots.

So ""TRNC"" licensed Turkey to drill SOUTH of Cyprus and then Turkey will give us half of our natural resources if we agree to give Turkey the rest. How kind of Turkey.

Also Turkey may act as if it is ""protecting"" the rights of Turkish Cypriots but it has already drilled many times in areas west and southwest of Cyprus (inside Cypriot EEZ) in areas that it claims as Turkish EEZ (not Turkish Cypriot EEZ), basically trying to steal resources that belong to Turkish Cypriots as well.",Cyprus,/r/europe/comments/hziz9z/turkey_issues_new_navtex_to_send_barbaros_in/fzm8bkf/,BitVectorR,1596027756

2496,"Spain did not have a big and prosperous jewish community before the reconquista.

Before you instantly downvote, let me explain why: the first thing is that the reconquista - itself already a controversial term historically speakimg - is an almost 8 century long process: from the occupation of Spain by the moors until all of their realms were conquered in the iberian peninsula,the last of them being Granada in 1492. So a wealthy and prosperous jewish community would have to be in Spain in the 7th century for this statement to be true.

So why isnt it true? First of all: yes, there were already jews living in the spanish provinces under the Roman Empire... But with the arrival of the visigoths there were alternating times of tolerance and expulsion in very ahort periods of time. As a result, the jewish community welcomed the islamic invasion and only began to flourish under them.

So it is more like the big and prosperous jewish community was during the reconquista.

As for Spain 'being the only one remembered' you would have to look towards the black legend, rather than anything else.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/hzl7j9/jewish_population_in_europe_1933_and_2015/fzlqz21/,reaqtion,1596012646

So the figure itself at the end of the day is an estimate, there is no way to know the real numbers and probably they will never be known, but I would say 1.5 million is probably over the real number counting only the WWI deaths, WWI after all technically ended in 1918 - I think the cited number only for this period tends to be 1.2 million. But then the Holocaust also didn't involve deaths only within the technical beginning date of WWII, but tends to count towards being a WWII genocide. Then there is the genocide timeline beginning from 1894 as well, which obviously is beyond the confines of WWI, but deaths from that period up to 1914 do not count towards the 1.5 million from my understanding.

2631,"This article completely brushes over how the protests  against the government started. The protests were  called by our President on  the 10th of July when on the same day the police as well as several prosecutor offices raided the presidency's  offices and  arrested two of the  president's advisors on allegations of  quid pro quo  and illegally  obtaining secret military documents as well  as creating a  conspiracy  to obtain said documents. This was days after the Rosenec incident and was about a week after one of these advisors house was searched and several of his co-conspirators were  arrested.

Also about  a week after a recording was released with the president's  other  advisor  discussing a visa  for a russian national that our security department  considerd ""dangerous to national securty"".

The   stated goal of the protests  is to ""overthrow"" the government AND  state prosecutor  that is leading the  investigation into the presidents  advisors.

The same prosecutor is  also leading several investigations against oligarchs close to  BSP (the  president's party and the party that will l get to create the interim  government along with the DPS party).

Several  days into the protests a recording between Vasil Bojkov (BSP oligarch  that is  hiding in Dubai from 19  indictments including murder, rape and  hiding 700 million euros from the bulgarian tax administration) and   Aleksander Paunov  a BSP MP.  
In the recording Bojkov among other  things claims that he paid 10-15 thousand for the protests and  controlled the protests trough the internet, including writing their  slogans.His stated intention was to topple the government and neutralize  the state prosecutor using the presidents influence.

2722,"&gt;Idk, anyway it's a easy misunderstanding to have. Since the term ""during the Holocaust"", is confusing and used mainly in Israel or by Jews. I didn't know before the history of Finnish Jews. From what a red, the was no antisemitism in Finland not even during the war. I think that says something about the Finnish people.


I don't think it says much about Finnish people, for people are the same everywhere. It's just that Finland's situation was different from that of many countries. The Finnish Jewish minority was very small. When Finland had been a part of Sweden, the laws had forbidden Jews from settling there. In 1809 Finland became a part of the Russian Empire. The old Swedish laws remained in force, but Jewish-Russian soldiers who were stationed in Finland had a special permission to settle in Finland after retiring. However, they were not allied to own land, so they gravitated towards the cities. They formed small communities in Helsinki, Turku and Viipuri, and synagogues and Jewish schools were established in these cities. In the late 19th century there were pogroms elsewhere in the Russian Empire, but in Finland there was no incentive for such atrocities.  


After the Russian Revolution in 1917 Finland became independent, and after a bloody civi war it became a democracy. The Jews became Finnish citizens same as everyone else, and they enjoyed the same civil rights.


Interwar Finland a young democracy riddled by internal divisions. The socialists had lost the Civil War and been brutally suppressed, and many of them harboured revenge. At the other end of the political spectrum were the fascists who almost managed to overthrow the government in 1932. However, many politicians worked hard to forge unity between different political and social groups, and in the 1930's things improved rapidly. By 1939 Finland had gained the reputation of being a well-organised, progressive nation with loyal citizens.


An anecdotal story claims that a Finnish politician once said to Himmler: ""We have no Jewish question"". This story may or may not be true, but the sentiment is quite accurate. In interwar Finland the Jews were a small and somewhat forgotten minority towards which few people had any strong feelings. I don't mean to say that there was no anti-semitism. Finland was a young nation which had always been ruled by foreigners, and many Finns feared attacks from the outside. Anyone who diverged from the typical Finnish citizen in any way could expect to meet with some xenophobia. For example, company-commander Solomon Klass found it impossible to advance got a high position in the Civil Guards (a right wing militia with a strong fascist presence). Olympic track champion Elias Katz received less attention from the Finnish press than the ethnically Finnish Paavo Nurmi and Ville Ritola. While this is certainly discriminatory, it's not the kind of explosive stuff that precedes a genocide.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/hzl7j9/jewish_population_in_europe_1933_and_2015/fzlcecz/,Silkkiuikku,1595999286

They were not always major actors, but almost always were pulling some strings one way or another. Usually to piss off the English or another of their usual partners in war.

But then, you have to look at the geographic situation of France: with access to the Mediterranee, the Atlantic and the English channel, borders with the Iberian peninsula, Italy, Switzerland (despite their current neutral state, they used to provide very skilled mercenaries to the highest bidder - already had their lust for money I guess), Germany (formerly the HRE which was also a great power in Europe they had to deal with as well). All that plus of course our personal nemesis: those pesky people across the channel who've tried holding lands in France since William the Conqueror crossed the channel.

And that's not even counting the viking invasions that lasted for a while when France and the British isles became their playground.

But then, France occupies a pretty strategic place in Europe and with its leaders not always great people (our last king got shortened by a head by his own people after all) it's no surprise that we've been brewing shit all over the continent, either to defend our precious territories or trying to steal some land or riches from a weaker neighbors.

Note: The term  ""Jewish refugees"", make me think they weren't Finnish. And the Finnish side of the story is, that it was a police matter they handed over 27 refuges ( only 6 Jews), It was still a local political scandal at the time, when it was published a month after the fact.

2926," 

FOR YEARS, many U.S. politicians and policymakers have derided the European Union as dysfunctional: a half-baked federation that adopted a common currency but not the measures needed to sustain it; a would-be United States of Europe unable to cohere around capable leaders. Early in the [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1) pandemic, the old critique appeared apt. Italy, Spain and several other nations were riddled with the virus while their leaders angrily traded recriminations.

Five months later, the tables have turned. E.U. nations, having largely succeeded in suppressing covid-19 infections, are returning to something resembling normal life, with schools, shops and businesses reopening. Last week, their leaders agreed on a landmark, $2.1 trillion financial package, including $857 billion in loans and grants for recovery financed by common E.U. bonds — a breakthrough toward a more integrated union. Meanwhile, the Europeans have closed their borders to the United States, where the coronavirus spreads uncontrolled and Congress [dithers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/07/27/senate-stimulus-coronavirus/?hpid=hp_hp-banner-main_bailouthill-1005am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_3) over soon-to-expire unemployment benefits.

[*Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_4)

One statistic captures[ the yawning transatlantic difference](https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-chart/?areas=usa&amp;areas=gbr&amp;areas=eur&amp;areasRegional=usny&amp;areasRegional=usca&amp;areasRegional=usfl&amp;areasRegional=ustx&amp;cumulative=0&amp;logScale=1&amp;perMillion=0&amp;values=deaths): At the end of last week, the 27 nations of the European Union were averaging 81 deaths a day from covid-19; the United States more than 900.

Several causes explain this disparity, including differences in U.S. and European demographics and health-care systems. But the most conspicuous might be quality of leadership. Europe’s coming together has been driven by two centrist politicians, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who adopted robust measures to control the epidemic in their own countries and then worked jointly to develop and push through the groundbreaking financial package.

Though they were caught off guard and badly mauled by the virus, Italy and Spain avoided the mistakes of many U.S. states. They imposed lockdowns that were thorough enough and lasted long enough to push infections down to a manageable level. They will now be the leading beneficiaries of the special recovery grants and loans the European commission will dole out over the next several years. Ms. Merkel, who reversed Germany’s long-standing resistance to issuing E.U. debt to cover the transfers, rightly recognized that failure to act could have led to a collapse of Italy’s finances — and perhaps a rupture of the European Union itself.

[*We are interested in hearing about how the struggle to reopen amid the pandemic is affecting people's lives. Please tell us yours.*](https://hosted-washpost.submissionplatform.com/sub/hosted/5f060125378d5400346b0b39)

Those who called the adoption of the plan by an E.U. summit last week the bloc’s “[Hamiltonian moment](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/french-german-european-recovery-plan-proposal-by-anatole-kaletsky-2020-05?barrier=accesspaylog),” in reference to the 1790 assumption of states’ debts by the U.S. government, were overstating it. This was a one-off deal that does not affect the debts already owed by individual countries. To overcome tough resistance from a few governments, E.U. leaders had to agree to some painful compromises, including watering down a linkage of loans to respect for the rule of law in countries such as Hungary and Poland. The deal must still be approved by national parliaments as well as the European Parliament, which could prove tricky.

Europe could still be hammered by another wave of infections; its recovery will be precarious until a vaccine or effective therapeutics emerge. The union nevertheless has been made stronger by the crisis, thanks to responsible leaders willing to make tough decisions and impose unpopular measures. That, sadly, cannot be said of the United States.",,/r/europe/comments/hznc4z/the_pandemic_has_made_europe_stronger/fzkonlm/,HappyPanicAmorAmor,1595984846

2936,"&gt; FOR YEARS, many U.S. politicians and policymakers have derided the European Union as dysfunctional: a half-baked federation that adopted a common currency but not the measures needed to sustain it; a would-be United States of Europe unable to cohere around capable leaders. Early in the coronavirus pandemic, the old critique appeared apt. Italy, Spain and several other nations were riddled with the virus while their leaders angrily traded recriminations.
&gt; 
&gt; Five months later, the tables have turned. E.U. nations, having largely succeeded in suppressing covid-19 infections, are returning to something resembling normal life, with schools, shops and businesses reopening. Last week, their leaders agreed on a landmark, $2.1 trillion financial package, including $857 billion in loans and grants for recovery financed by common E.U. bonds — a breakthrough toward a more integrated union. Meanwhile, the Europeans have closed their borders to the United States, where the coronavirus spreads uncontrolled and Congress dithers over soon-to-expire unemployment benefits.
&gt; 
&gt; One statistic captures the yawning transatlantic difference: At the end of last week, the 27 nations of the European Union were averaging 81 deaths a day from covid-19; the United States more than 900.
&gt; 
&gt; Several causes explain this disparity, including differences in U.S. and European demographics and health-care systems. But the most conspicuous might be quality of leadership. Europe’s coming together has been driven by two centrist politicians, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who adopted robust measures to control the epidemic in their own countries and then worked jointly to develop and push through the groundbreaking financial package.
&gt; 
&gt; Though they were caught off guard and badly mauled by the virus, Italy and Spain avoided the mistakes of many U.S. states. They imposed lockdowns that were thorough enough and lasted long enough to push infections down to a manageable level. They will now be the leading beneficiaries of the special recovery grants and loans the European commission will dole out over the next several years. Ms. Merkel, who reversed Germany’s long-standing resistance to issuing E.U. debt to cover the transfers, rightly recognized that failure to act could have led to a collapse of Italy’s finances — and perhaps a rupture of the European Union itself.
&gt; 
&gt; We are interested in hearing about how the struggle to reopen amid the pandemic is affecting people's lives. Please tell us yours.
&gt; 
&gt; Those who called the adoption of the plan by an E.U. summit last week the bloc’s “Hamiltonian moment,” in reference to the 1790 assumption of states’ debts by the U.S. government, were overstating it. This was a one-off deal that does not affect the debts already owed by individual countries. To overcome tough resistance from a few governments, E.U. leaders had to agree to some painful compromises, including watering down a linkage of loans to respect for the rule of law in countries such as Hungary and Poland. The deal must still be approved by national parliaments as well as the European Parliament, which could prove tricky.
&gt; 
&gt; Europe could still be hammered by another wave of infections; its recovery will be precarious until a vaccine or effective therapeutics emerge. The union nevertheless has been made stronger by the crisis, thanks to responsible leaders willing to make tough decisions and impose unpopular measures. That, sadly, cannot be said of the United States.

Sounds Fair.  


"" I already heard this mad shit before from some Baltic guy. ""  


So now you hear it from Polish and Ukrainian guys. If there were some Georgian, probably would tell the same story. I've heard Belarusian's also became concerned recently.  


Do you know that saying: if everyone is telling you that you're drunk, better go to bed, even if you weren't drinking at all?

I know it's easier to dismiss these with ""they're crazy, brainwashed"". But we all are rather educated here. Is this really a propaganda or maybe for once you will listen what others have to say? NATO exists for a reason, pal. And it's surely not for ""conquering"" Moscow. We don't want that trouble here.   
I only wonder, because it's well known fact Russia is hysterical as well. Do you also consider it ridiculous? When we want to install anti-missile shield and Russia go ""reee"". Whenever new member joins NATO and Russia go ""omg no"". What are you so afraid of?   


"" Why does Russia need it? ""  
No one knows, that's the point. A never ending sphere of influence, I suppose. Soviet Union once was great and now it's not. People need to unify under some new stimulus. Maybe we ""re-take"" Crimea?

3379,"&gt; an app that would encrypt communications between two peers but ALSO send a copy of everything received to be stored in their database unencrypted, would qualify and be adequately described as E2EE

I salute you, now you see why e2ee isn't a very useful label. It works extremely well for marketing purposes, but doesn't give you very good security guarantees. Go check three ""e2ee communication apps"" on your phone right now and try to figure out 1) whether someone would be able to steal the account (in its default configuration) using phishing or sim swapping; 2) whether you'd get notified if someone loses their account OR adds a new device/changes device. Now you could be asking ""what's the point of e2ee if app does not protect me from impersonation or MITM?"" and I would agree that such an app should not be describe as ""e2ee"" and yet here we are marketing wizards have spoken. All ""e2ee"" buzzword tells you is that app supposedly uses an algorithm designed for e2ee. By itself it doesn't tell you that this algorithm does a good job at what it's supposed to you (not all e2ee apps use axolotl), doesn't tell you that algorithm was implemented properly, doesn't tell you what sort of metainformation or even parts of your real conversations get leaked where, doesn't tell you what tracking information (unrelated to conversations) gets collected, how often and where it gets sent; doesn't tell you how well the servers are protected and who has access to them; doesn't tell you what account recovery policies are or what's stored in backups, or how the data is stored locally, or how the key material is stored and synchronized/backed up; what are the options of adding a new device and whether protocol allows operator to add a ""shadow"" one without you or your friends knowing about it, doesn't tell you what other functionality is built in the client and whether service provider can push configuration/code that's specific for you... frankly ""e2ee"" doesn't tell you anything of importance.

&gt; Storing informations about the political opinions of people without their consent is a very serious offense in my country.
Who's talking about storing any data without people's consent though? Honestly, I'm not sure where this line of your reasoning is going. Choosing to use e2ee for data channel doesn't limit app developers from collecting whatever information they would be able to connect without e2ee. Either legally or illegaly. There is no legislation that if you're using ""e2ee"" buzzword to market your app, you're forever barred from collecting any information about customer.

&gt; It's there to protect against actors that ignore the laws, such as foreign (or sometimes, not so foreign) governments, companies that think regulations doesn't apply to them, and the like.
You have no idea what you're talking about. Properly implemented e2ee is supposed to protect you from the app developers/maintainers easily reading your texts; either out of curiosity or to fulfill their legal obligation. The problem is that unless you're using open source app or trust app developers more than you should, you don't really know how seriously they take that e2ee thing, whether they have any ways around it and whether they have an option of introducing these at some later point. All the things you mentioned - protecting your messages over the wire from spying criminals, corporations or governments - are just as easily fulfilled by generic transport layer security (TLS). So, because most people don't use open source apps and because most people aren't able to evaluate app security posture (and don't even enable security features available in the app), they don't really get much benefit from the ""e2ee"" versus simply well engineered texting app. The ones who do see the big difference though are app developers - as *they* have less risks if they're not storing client data. No chance of malicious insider spying on his ex, no chance of some celebrity's private sexting messages making national news, no need to have huge content moderation teams in all languages and time zones.

3416,"&gt; Belgium and the Netherlands have -- to differing degrees -- folded loot boxes into their gambling regulation frameworks.  This resulted in companies like Electronic Arts, Valve, and Blizzard simply making in-game currency unavailable in accordance with national law while continuing business unabated elsewhere: hardly the solution many have been looking for.

Hmm.  Why?  I mean, if it's been determined  as a problem in Belgium and Belgium legislated against it, why does it harm Belgium if others decide otherwise and don't do the same?

I mean, normally the bar for centralizing a regulation is that you cannot effectively regulate locally.  Like, say Belgium banned loot boxes and Belgians were just slipping across the border to Germany and playing there unabated, that'd be a good argument to move regulation to a higher level.  Belgium couldn't effectively regulate at a state level.

But if I have this aright from the article, the regulation *is* having effect in Belgium.  Belgians are getting a  gaming-experience-sans-what-they-judge-to-be-gambling.  It's just that people would like other places to also create such a regulation.

3511,"&gt;it's possible to eat healthily and cheaply, if you do a lot more prep and shop carefully, eat the same meal three days straight.

what exactly is wrong with any of these things?...

this is how most of the world lives.

&gt;assuming you have the time between your minimum wage jobs.

cooking requires minimal time. somebody working 80 hours a week and sleeping 8 hours a night still has 30 hours a week to do other things. cooking would take up about 10 hours a week for a person who is unskilled. it takes me about 5 after a few years of practice.

&gt;It's a lot EASIER to eat healthily if you're not poor.

dude, everything is easier if you're not poor. money buys time and opportunities. that's no secret. i wish i could get individually wrapped fresh salmon for $1/lb but that's not the world we live in.

&gt;Now, if your goal is to put the blame for obesity on poor people being lazy, well done, mission accomplished, but it doesn't actually change the obesity rate.

i never said poor people are lazy. in fact, you're just putting words in my mouth because i didn't reference poor people or poverty in my post at all. i just stated a cheap way to bring meat into the meal.

all people are lazy. marketing from fast food, delivery, restaurants, etc makes us all lazier.

if your goal was to complain how good we have it in first world nations that we invented obesity, well done, mission accomplished.

3542,"Ireland statistics are muddled, Ireland is pretty much the only “developed” economy in the world who’s gross national product is smaller (and considerably so) than their GDP.

GNP includes foreign investment and repatriation so for most countries GNP is higher than GDP because more money is coming in than going out.

Since Ireland essentially a way station for multinationals it’s the other way around and they take out far more than they put in.

Services account for about 75% of their total exports, multinationals accounting practices account for nearly 60% of all exports in nominal value.

This is isn’t a sign of a healthy economy the Irish economy has more similarities with tax heavens in the Caribbean than with Sweden or Germany.

GNP is a much more valuable statistic in this case than GDP since it reflects the net amount of what actually stays in the country including net foreign contributions (which in Ireland’s case are negative, they lose about 25% of their GDP to repatriation each year): https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IRL/ireland/gnp-gross-national-product",,/r/europe/comments/hzage7/net_exports_in_european_countries/fzianrb/,ObviouslyTriggered,1595940895

3575,"&gt;HOW can countries become more resilient to the [coronavirus](https://www.newscientist.com/term/coronavirus/)?  You may have heard about face masks, hand-washing and avoiding crowds.  But as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was recovering from [covid-19](https://www.newscientist.com/term/covid-19/) in May, he announced another tactic: targeting the nation’s waistlines.  
&gt;  
&gt;People who are overweight are certainly at a higher risk of  developing severe covid-19, especially if they also have type 2  diabetes, which is linked to obesity. Around a third of UK adults are  overweight, and roughly another third are obese. Johnson has blamed his  own weight for how severely he was affected by coronavirus when he was  admitted to hospital in April.  
&gt;  
&gt;England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, also said this  month that losing weight would reduce people’s chances of a severe case  of covid-19 if there is a second wave in the country this winter and  advised that people should get “as fit as possible”.                       
&gt;  
&gt;There is just one problem: we don’t actually know the best way for  people to lose weight and keep it off. Many initiatives have been tried,  but very few have been shown to work. “There’s no country in the world  that has solved this,” says Michael Lean at the University of Glasgow,  UK.  
&gt;  
&gt;People in most countries have been getting gradually heavier over the  past few decades, with the UK one of the heaviest countries in Europe.  This seems to be exacerbating the severity of the covid-19 outbreak,  researchers argued in a [recent editorial](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m2237) in the medical journal *BMJ*.  
&gt;  
&gt;The UK government hasn’t yet released specifics of how it plans to  reverse this trend, but it is unlikely to be as simple as people getting  fitter, as Harries implied.  
&gt;  
&gt;While exercise seems to help prevent weight gain, [studies have shown that it doesn’t cause people to lose weight](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2013.09.012),  perhaps because it is hard to achieve the levels necessary to burn off a  significant amount of fat. It may also make people hungrier. Physical  activity seems to have a host of health benefits, including protecting  against heart disease and boosting mental health, [but weight loss isn’t one of them](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24132130-400-why-doing-more-exercise-wont-help-you-burn-more-calories/).  
&gt;  
&gt;“People who are no longer young and have become heavy find it  enormously difficult to exercise enough to have any meaningful effect on  weight,” says Roy Taylor at Newcastle University in the UK.  
&gt;  
&gt;Going on a diet may seem the obvious way to lose weight, but while  losing weight this way is possible, if unpleasant, keeping it off is  much harder. Most people who lose weight through dieting regain [most if not all of it within a year or two and some end up heavier than when they started](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2239417-diets-do-help-you-lose-weight-but-the-benefits-usually-dont-last/).  
&gt;  
&gt;Figures are hard to come by, but [one large and respected health-tracking survey in the US](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3671378/)  found that the number of overweight or obese adults who succeeded in  losing 10 per cent of their weight and keeping it off for at least a  year was just one in six.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/hzb356/average_adult_bmi_in_the_uk_over_time/fzib25c/,WufflyTime,1595941161

3580,"**Hard to shake**

&gt;People who attend weight-loss clinics that offer intensive support  have somewhat better outcomes, but results are still disheartening. For  instance, Taylor ran a programme based in Tyneside, north-east England,  and Scotland that won recognition for helping people with diabetes lose  enough weight to put their condition into remission. The programme  offers a low-calorie shake-based diet for three months followed by  monthly appointments for support in weight maintenance. Yet even here, [just a third managed to keep their diabetes in remission for two years.](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-8587(19)30068-3)  
&gt;  
&gt;Disillusionment with mainstream dietary advice to cut out fat may be contributing to the growing popularity of controversial [low-carb diets](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23030771-600-fat-vs-carbs-whats-really-worse-for-your-health/). Instead of avoiding fat and counting calories, these involve limiting starchy foods like bread and pasta.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some low-carb weight-loss clinics have reported impressive short-term  results, but as yet there is little data on how many people manage to  keep up this type of diet and maintain their weight loss long term,  perhaps because these diets haven’t been popular for very long. It is a  troubling gap in our knowledge if the aim is to avoid deaths from  covid-19, since low-carb diets seem [particularly helpful](http://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.115.112581)  to people with diabetes and pre-diabetes, who are at an increased risk  of covid-19, probably because starchy foods raise blood sugar.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although it may seem extreme, the most effective way to lose weight is to undergo one of the various forms of [weight-loss surgery](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327241-100-full-without-food-can-surgery-cure-obesity/),  which shrink the stomach or redirect the gut. Such surgery makes it  harder to overeat, and also means nutrients aren’t absorbed as well.  Increasing access to weight-loss surgery is one of the options Johnson  is [reportedly considering](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/28/gastric-bands-become-widely-available-new-government-plans-tackle/) in response to the coronavirus.  
&gt;  
&gt;Randomised trials have shown that such surgery does help people lose  significant weight and that type 2 diabetes often goes into remission.  But it is a major operation that carries additional risks to the normal  concerns about surgery. For example, one study estimates that one in 10  people who have it [develop some kind of addiction,](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2014.10.026) such as alcoholism – as if people are [transferring a previous “addiction”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528810-200-the-people-who-are-addicted-to-addiction/) to food to something else once they can no longer eat the same quantities.  
&gt;  
&gt;There were long waiting lists for weight-loss surgery in the UK  before the pandemic hit. During lockdown, all non-urgent operations were  stopped. While services are now resuming, that backlog has increased.  It is hard to see how the UK’s health service would be able to ramp up  its provision of weight-loss surgery before this winter. “Is surgery for  30 per cent of the population really what we should be tilting at?”  says Lean.  
&gt;  
&gt;For Linia Patel, a dietitian and spokesperson for the British  Dietetic Association, the only solution is to make societal changes to  put the obesity epidemic into reverse. In public health parlance, we are  living in an “obesogenic” environment, [which makes it hard for people to resist eating more and expending less energy](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23431282-000-collective-rather-than-individual-action-can-beat-obesity/).  “There should be far more emphasis on educating people to eat better  and creating an environment that encourages them to do so,” says Patel.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yet it would take years for these sorts of changes to have any effect  on the population’s weight. And even here, there are few strategies  proven to be effective at reducing levels of obesity.  
&gt;  
&gt; There are many differences between how people live their lives today  and how they did before obesity rates started climbing, and we don’t  know which are the most important in causing obesity (see “[Why are we getting heavier?](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24732922-400-what-is-the-best-way-to-lose-weight-and-keep-it-off-for-good/#bx329224B1)“, below).  
&gt;  
&gt;One option would be to run state-funded long-term randomised trials  to answer the question of whether we should discourage people from  eating fat or carbohydrates. Advocates of each at least agree we should  be trying to steer people away from highly processed foods, like fast  food, ready meals and snacks, which tend to be high in fat, sugar and  salt. “The food industry has been riding all over us,” says Graham  MacGregor at Queen Mary University of London, who co-authored the *BMJ* editorial.  
&gt;  
&gt;The question is how to do that steering. Countless school-based  programmes that aim to teach children about exercise and healthy eating  have [failed to reduce obesity.](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k507)  Public health doctors have long called for tougher measures, like  restricting junk food advertising and the number of fast food  restaurants allowed near schools.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are also calls to change the way food is taxed, so that highly  processed food becomes more expensive. The UK government has just done  the opposite, however, [temporarily slashing taxes for restaurants](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53411649) in an effort to encourage consumer spending post-lockdown.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ultimately, if Johnson’s recent brush with death has made him rethink  the importance of tackling obesity, that is probably a good thing for  the UK’s health that will bring benefits beyond the pandemic. But with  many firms struggling as the country enters a deep recession, a cut in  consumption to help people slim down may be hard to swallow.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/hzb356/average_adult_bmi_in_the_uk_over_time/fzib3h7/,WufflyTime,1595941185

3582,"**Why are we getting heavier?**

&gt;In nearly every country in the world, average weight is on the  increase. This trend will be hard to reverse unless we know which  aspects of life are responsible, and there are many suspects:  
&gt;  
&gt;• People are eating more. Average daily calorie intake has gone up in  high-income countries, from around 3000 calories a day in the 1960s to  3400 in 2015, [according to the World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/3_foodconsumption/en/).  
&gt;  
&gt;• We may be eating the wrong sorts of food. For a long time, the  chief villain was seen as too much fat in our diet. More recently,  public health doctors have turned their attention to sugar.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Highly processed food is often high in fat, sugar and salt. There  has certainly been a major shift from eating home-cooked meals to snacks  and fast food in many countries. But there is very little evidence from  randomised trials to show that eating less processed foods leads to  weight loss, apart from [one study,](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008) which only involved 20 people for two weeks.

So again, we're not discussing US CC habits. We're talking about Europeans who mainly use the CCs for convenience rather than the credit feature of it. For the most part, anyway.

This was all in response to someone talking about how CC are used. Not the economic gains of having a CC card system in your economy. I think you're missing the point of this discussion.

Most stores / restaurants / public buildings have one though, but our grid is prepared and could even take more because we have higher overload in the winter than in summer (a lot of french heating appliances use electrical power).

And if you want to know why most houses don't have AC, it's because we're used to heat (if it's under 25°C, it's totally normal and until 30, 35°C it's not that bad either) and buildings are kinda built to protect us from these heatwaves even if, seeing as we commonly have 0-10°C temperatures in winter, it's hard to build houses that are both resistant to heat AND cold weather.

Yes, but that's oversimplification. If you're talking about privacy in legal sense, then 1) you need more then security to have privacy; 2) you don't necessarily need the highest security requirements to have privacy (e.g. there is no requirement to actually protect data in transit with encryption).

If you're idealistically talking about *the best possible privacy*, then that's just really Confidentiality - one aspect of information security. There are two more - Integrity and Availability and unfortunately you can't ever have more than two of those at the same time. You're also looking at this purely from consumer's perspective while there are more interests at play. For example, if Reddit was placing users' privacy over everything else, mods wouldn't be able to ban trolls or bots on /r/europe and reddit itself wouldn't be able to quarantine/ban /r/the_donald, /r/physical_removal, /r/pizzagate or /r/beatingwomen.

It looks like it's more complex than that - it looks like a very complex but valid construction of holdings and companies on first sight, but when you take a closer look it is clear it's a tax evasion scheme that allows IKEA to transfer billions in franchise earnings to Luxemburg, where a 1929 law allows them to park the money without paying taxes. The Dutch fiscal service ruled in favor of IKEA twice, greenlighting different schemes (that had the same effect) and those rulings are now being researched by the EU. So IKEA Delft isn't a straightforward Dutch charity, as it clearly isn't, but it is definitely a hub in a tax evasion construction.

3867,"&gt; And no, unlike you, I don't see issuing settlers alien passports as punishment. 

What you are proposing is that one set of former Soviet citizens living in Crimea should have less rights (the granting of Ukrainian citizenship to the Soviet citizens of the former Ukrainian SSR) than other Soviet citizens living in Crimea bases solely on their arrival there (or their ancestors arrival) being after the deportation of the Crimean Tatars. There would have been no legal justification for such a measure - both before and after 1944 the Crimea was legal Soviet territory, with any Soviet citizens arriving both before and after having the status of legal migrants within their own country. Therefore, your proposed measure would not be one justified by any type of law regulating citizenship and migration, but one that treated one part of the population of a country unequally - which is the very definition of punishment. Worse that that, it would be collective punishment - a reprehensible measure unacceptable by any civilized nation - since it would be imposed not for any personal fault, but due to a group characteristic. And again, I don't believe for a moment that you would fail to understand this if those affected were Turks or Muslims in general. Or at least not (mainly) Russians.

&gt;Yeah sorry but no, I'm not excusing any empire's crimes. I'm not GMantis talking about Russian Empires at the end of the day so meh. And meh again that Crimean Khanate wasn't Ottoman Empire so it sounds like you're trying to pull things up here.
And sure, while Crimean Khanate wasn't the nicest I don't see any point in bringing them into discussion unless you're to justify colonisation and genocide in 20th century. So? That's aside, Russia sure practiced similar enslavement in its surrounding lands and colonised lands, mainly in Siberia and also long sided with Tatars to raid others anyway. So meh...

The current government(ruling party) has fallen several times but has managed to get reelected every time.
To give context on the years : GERB is the ruling party. They were in power from 2009 to 2013, 2014 to 2017 and 2017 till present day.

The only other relevant big party is the Socialist party, sadly our Socialist party embraces its Communist history instead of fighting againts it. Usually the 3rd largest are ether right wing nationalists or a party that plays the race card in a very blatantly obvious ways(it appeals almost exclusively to minorities but works againts their interests).",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/hyyqv5/bulgaria_19_consecutive_days_of_protests_against/fzh83vk/,prodandimitrow,1595907642

4200,"Damn... there's a lot of resentment in this thread. Here on reddit, I constantly see us accused of feeling superior, but in real life I don't see it ...well, at least not against SE and EE. 

However, most of us almost never see *any* violence against women. The only incidence I can ever think about was when my cousin got beat up by her BF because she broke up with him. This was 10 years ago, EVERYONE was outraged by it and the dude got sent to jail. If other Scandinavian redditors have similar experiences, I can understand why they'd doubt that we should be almost 3 times as bad as just south of the border. It's not that we think SE are bad, just that it's hard to imagine it being SO rampant here if we hardly ever see it.

Still, I got 3 theories, freshly pulled out from my ass, that might explain some of the numbers. 

First off is the self-reporting. Even highly specific questions can be interpreted in many different ways depending on culture. For instance, if you slap me three times and I pushed you back, would you actually report that as a ""shove""? How would you report it if I restrained you? Would you see it as rape if you didn't want to, but I didn't know that? 

Secondly, it could also be affected by promiscuity. If 3 ladies each sleep with 3 men in a year and one of those men are violent, that's going to show up a lot worse than if each lady stayed with one man.

Thirdly, there's the parallel cultures. I have no idea what's happening in the ghettos or the refugee facilities on this issue, but the criminal statistics suggest they'd boost the numbers up drastically.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/hynnqo/violence_against_women_in_the_lifetime/fzgdv6x/,YourLostTwin,1595890323

Right now we have the ""Socialist Party"" and ""Unidas Podemos"" in the government. The last one is a extreme left wing party with at least 2 Ministers belonging to the comunist party (Alberto Garzon and Yolanda Diaz) and some others like the vicepresident Pablo Iglesias and his wife in the same line, having been advisers of Chavez in Venezuela, or praising the public policies in Argentina.

 I've been reading their statements in the press for the past few months, and they have been criticizing the monarchy (the king is the head of the army) , some articles in the Constitution and some judges, the freedom of press, the European Union... In summary, they are against any counter-power  that prevents the implementation of comunist measures right now.  If we where not in the  EU and we had no monarchy  they could change the constitution to monopolize power and control press and judges in a similar way as Chavez did.

In fact I see other comment saying that we could create our own currency and selling it as something positive to create employment, and this is a perfect example of populism, forgetting to talk about all the harmful effects of this,  like lower imports, lower savings, hyperinflation, shortage of goods, etc as already experienced in other countries.

 On top of this,  the Spanish policies are not aligned with the European ones, since our government is social/comunist and their governments are liberal / conservative.

I used the per capita numbers because I wanted to show economic growth per person. I think it gives a better idea of economic performance over time, because otherwise the difference in population growth becomes a very significant factor, rathern than the economic growth itself.

The reason why I used PPP is to get rid of the currency variation. 

The reason why I don't use the one that shows 'constant 2017 international dollars' is because that one distorts the data when comparing multiple countries. It's supposed to only be used when comparing a country with itself in the past, not when comparing the growth of multiple countries. 

Basically think about it like this, countries have different rates of inflation, when comparing two countries let's say in the year 2000, you would want to use the international dollars from the year 2000, to see which was richer in 2000. If you use international dollars from the year 2017, you get what country would have been richer with the  2017 dollars, but that doesn't matter when looking at the year 2000, what matters is the 'current international dollar', in this example the 2000 dollar.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/hywyfx/gdp_per_capita_growth_in_the_eu_and_other_rich/fzfkb7f/,bobama123,1595875914

And refuting Samuelson by stating that he was a 'biased social scientist' is easy to do in hindsight. What's not so easy is to provide a critical evaluation of an economic ranking in the present time. You have provided no attempt at critical evaluation of iHDI. All you have said is that it's 'obvious' that Belarus is 'worse' than Spain, because it has a lower income. Your presentation of income vs cost of living is at least a small move in the direction of a meaningful discussion. But as you are no doubt aware, the iHDI already includes income with PPP in its calculations.

Teslas are desirable, attractive-looking and offer some very high performance in key specifications (acceleration) and are still among the leaders when it comes to range. They also are very advanced in terms of connectivity and software, they're premium cars in many ways and directly compete with other ""dream cars"" from BMW, Mercedes-Benz and so on.

Basically they evoke emotion in people, whereas cars such as the Zoe or Nissan Leaf do not.

4429,"&gt;here are the countries that discriminate most or least against non-white people"" is misleading, because the data presented do not only concern non-whites for some countries (UK, Canada, Belgium, USA).

Yes the study includes white immigrants but the researchers split the applicants into five racial categories, one of them being white so when they calculate the discrimination rate against nonwhites they would obviously keep the whites out of that calculation

&gt;However, the MENA's people are not the group of rejection (ostracism) in all countries. They are not in the United States where blacks and Latinos have this social role.

If you look at page 13 youll see that the one study they did there including MENA showed actually the highest discrimination ratio against MENA minorities for the US of all of the nine countries. One study doesnt sufficiently show what is going on but its a hint in the direction that even though there arent a lot of MENA Minorities in the US theyre discriminated against nonetheless. 

&gt;Conversely, discrimination against Latino people is much stronger in the United States than elsewhere. Concluding on discrimination in general by using only data on Latinos would put the United States at a disadvantage. To do the same with the MENA countries would put France at a disadvantage, and the same for the United Kingdom with the East Asians.

Yeah this is why they took a whole bunch of studies on different racial groups and didnt compare the discrimination of individual groups between countries but instead measured the extent of the discrimination groups get. That way you can compare the extent of racism at least in employment through many different countries even though the group most discriminated against is different in every country. If you look at France for example they have the highest measurable discrimination against blacks which is also the highest discrimination ratio. France also leads the chart in discrimination against MENA minorities, ignoring that one US Study whose confidence interval is literally of the charts, so it does make sense that they lead this list.

Of course adding more groups for countries like Germany would give a clearer picture of the extent racial discrimination has here, maybe theres a minority treated even worse than turks in Germany but it is possible to get a gist of the extent of racial discrimination in different countries with this",,/r/europe/comments/hyr3sd/hiring_discrimination_in_nine_western_countries/fzfl0oa/,peer_plex,1595876254

Saying that is like calling a modern ICE car as something identical to 1980s car.The gap between 1980s EVs and modern ones is arguably bigger than between conventional cars.

Or like people that line up for new models after refresh of basically every car that reaches production.

A power that can throw endless bodies at any problem. A power that has flooded Western universities with it's brightest and brought home intellect about to challenge western dominance in many sectors, as we have seen in telephony among other tech.

As the U.S starts to focus it's alignment with Japan, Taiwan &amp; South Korea to challenge China, NATO's role in the west will dilute, and the frustration with the EU's lack of commitment to the large spending as the U.S will make it eventually withdraw. With this leaves an EU that for once starts to organise itself militarily, by removing duplications and creating an EU defence structure that can draw upon the the resources and capability of it's member states. With this change, I suspect the EU will eventually start to understand that Russia is no threat to it's borders if it respects Russia's strategic interest. Common ground will eventually be found which will see a closer union between member states &amp; Russia, where economic partnership takes a front seat as a kicking and screaming Baltic states along with Poland cry foul over an enemy they once enjoyed to salivate over and having to learn to close the past chapters of history and turn a new page.

Borrowing and spending is the only way out. If you cut education spending, future generations aren't prepared. If you cut healthcare spending, people's quality of life worsens. If you can invest in education, stimulate the economy - the GDP grows over time, we are then able to pay off the debt we accumulated and be better off, with a functioning economy, educated citizens and a high quality of life.

Obviously I didn't mean no woman got ever promoted. However, we do encounter a higher bar or even a glass ceiling.

&gt; Especially in big companies/tech they prefer to hire women so there is less inequality in men:women ratio.

I am actually a woman in tech in Poland. It's true I can't complain much. I do have special opportunities, I do get a lot of help and kindness... There are many good sides. I am also however seen as a diversity hire, I need to prove myself more, my skills are questioned more... The women at my university are all brilliant: a man can be mediocre and get a university job, a woman must be exceptional.

Tech is also very meritocratic. At the end of the day, you can be as sexist as you want, but when I deliver the code, the code speaks for itself. I don't really know how it is in other domains. (I know male nurses get way more physical work, probably like in the shop you mentioned.)

&gt; I talked with women from eastern countries and usa, also saw many situations, and even though it is getting better there, Poland is much more pleasant for women.

Well, one metric that worries me a lot is the number of women who leave IT: those are women who made it, didn't get discouraged by all the stereotypes, acquired the skills, had many other jobs to chose from... and still left.

They're employing the same authoritarian tactics of populism and propaganda, of controling the media, of eroding democratic institutions and the judiciary that might restrict or threaten their power. They both vilify outsiders and minorities as well as politcial opposition to stirr up fears and hate among their population and exploit those for political power.

Only Russia is way down that road already and Poland still might turn around at some point.

4815,"[Some numbers for Finland](https://www.heuni.fi/material/attachments/heuni/reports/6KHnLcUwR/Full_report_66.pdf), measuring physical violence, sexual violence, and threats of violence. The study focuses on violence against men (n = 1918), but includes numbers for women (n = 1283) as well.

Shortly:

* 55.5% of men (15-74 yo) have experienced (physical or sexual) violence or threats of violence after turning 15 years old, 15.9% in the last 12 months. The numbers are 55.4% and 14.6% for women.

* The study raises a point that 70% of men aged 24-44 years have experienced violence or threats of violence after turning 15 years old. For 65-74 years old men the number is merely 30%. The study concludes that it is possible the older men are not as willing to report on their experiences.

* 59.1% of men experienced physical violence before the age of 15. 2.6% of men experienced sexual violence before the age of 15. The numbers are 53.9% and 13.1% for women.

* 15.6% of men have experienced violence or threats of violence from their current intimate partner, 5.6% in the last 12 months. The numbers are 16.9% and 4.3% for women.

* 21.6% of men have experienced violence or threats of violence from a former intimate partner. The number is 41.7% for women.

* Violence or threats of violence from an intimate partner were more likely to cause physical or psychological damage when targeting women. With the current partner the percentages (of those targeted) are 11.9% for men and 27.3% for women, and with a former partner 25% for men and 36.6% for women.

* Violence or threats of violence from the current intimate partner started more recently for men. 74.2% of cases had started within 10 years, 25.8% over 10 years ago. For women the numbers were 50.6% and 49.4% respectively. 

* The study shows that experiences of intimate partner violence were more recent for men. The study speculates that this is because men do not recognize or remember violence that happened long ago, especially if it didn't cause any physical injuries or psychological damage.

* The respondents were aged 15-74. Older respondents have on average experienced more violence and threats of violence in their lifetime, with some exceptions such as the 70% vs. 30% numbers for men mentioned earlier. Younger respondents have on average experienced more violence or threats of violence in the last 12 months.

* Men belonging to an ethnic, religious, or sexual minority experienced more violence than average (24% vs 16%). For women the situation was the same (20% vs 14%). The sample size of men and women born outside of Finland was small, but these men experienced more violence than average while women experienced less violence than average.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/hynnqo/violence_against_women_in_the_lifetime/fze4vo0/,Doofucius,1595847205
4816,"'Horseshoe theory' - almost all extremist parties (on either wing) have aspects to them that make them most similar to the other extreme. In other words, the 'left to right' divide is not so much a straight line; it's a horseshoe, with the 2 extremes of the horse shoe quite close together.

Thus, PVV? Far right - just because some aspects sound similar to what the far left parties are saying doesn't make them any less far right.

Let's say a liberal, business-friendly political party like e.g. VVD in the netherlands holds that giving lots of subsidies to certain green tech is wise, and makes it a pillar of their electoral campaign, based on the idea that making the country a leader in that technology and foresees a rosy economic future exporting this expertise over the coming decades.

That makes it... entirely a lightly right leaning political party. The fact that they are saying things you'd normally hear from left leaning parties has no bearing on this.

There are, of course, parties that don't fit well – but almost always those are parties that promise everything, including mutually exclusive things – which makes them populists, which tends to attract far right, which tends to turn them into a far right party.

This process is almost inevitable, and we've seen it time and again:

* Some party has all sorts of viewpoints, from across the political spectrum. One of them smacks enough of racism that it causes significant friction with most/all other political parties. Let's call this the 'Extremist Immigration Viewpoint' (EIV).
* Voters whose first priority is the EIV didn't have a party that would allow them to voice EIV, but now there is a party. This makes EIV voters (usually, straight up racists, but doesn't have to be) flock to the new party, making the EIV a more important part of this new party's total viewpoint outlay: It's considered 'most important' by more and more members.
* Those voters for the new party that only lightly ascribe to the EIV, or don't ascribe to it at all, start noticing that the EIV is one of the most important viewpoints the party holds, and can't get anything done working together with any other party, because the new party is ostracized by other parties for the EIV. Some of these voters/party members will join or found other parties instead, because the party's priorities aren't aligned with theirs. Thus.. making the EIV an _even more_ more important viewpoint for the new party.
* Eventually, the party is defined solely by the EIV. Voting / joining this party means the EIV is your most important viewpoint. Because this viewpoint is unacceptable to the other parties, and because it is their most important viewpoint, their other viewpoints just don't matter.

... and, of course, EIV is inevitably bound up with extreme right ideology. Thus, the PVV and all parties that follow this trajectory need to be dark blue on this map. If you listen to the rhetoric or read the party platform of any of these EIV parties, it's all very very similar.",,/r/europe/comments/hynfbv/oc_parliament_of_every_european_country/fze4vqr/,rzwitserloot,1595847207

Let’s say there was a hypothetical one-month period of time where countries were debating whether to enforce a lockdown or not. Whereas Norway locked down in week 1 or 2 in this hypothetical scenario, let’s say England waited for week 3 or 4. This could result in Norway having way less total spreaders at the end of the one-month period than England. The Nordics don’t have as much of a need for masks as there are less people spreading it.

Russia has no Restraining order.. it just doesn't exist.

There is no legislative recourse adressing domestic violence in russia, 2 bills that would adress it, were proposed since 1991 and never passed, further a recent bill was proposed and rejected, So Still, the russian legal system has no laws adressing domestic abuse, which means it is considered a ""private matter"", a spouse can slap his partner around, until physical damage actually happens, thats when the perpetrator can be charged with assault, but not sooner.

Victims are instead encouraged to ""reconcile"". With their abusers since Russia focuses on keeping nuclear families intact as a strategy to combat lowerring birth-rates.

The amount of safe-houses for domestic abuse victims also speaks for itself i believe.

I know about it because my wife follows Russian lawyers and activists on social media, who are actively trying to combat these things, and so it is a subject that comes up and is discussed frequently.

I'm not saying this to shit on Russia, I in many ways actually like Russia, and I understand it's often the target of unjustified hit pieces to make it look worse than it is, but it doesn't mean that every bad thing reported is therefore a hit piece... and thats why I want them to do better, as does my wife.

Chez les Berbères, eux aussi musulmans, les femmes ont moins de restrictions : les femmes touaregs peuvent participer à la vie publique aux côtés des hommes.

Dans les régions rurales, parents, enfants, grands-parents, tantes, oncles, frères et sœurs vivent sous le même toit. Les couples mariés ont toutefois des espaces privés et cuisinent leurs propres repas. Tous les membres de la famille éduquent les enfants en leur transmettant les valeurs familiales. Dans les villes, les couples mariés sont aujourd’hui de plus en plus nombreux à vivre dans leur propre logement. Beaucoup de mariages sont arrangés.

L’hospitalité est une valeur traditionnelle très respectée par les Arabes comme par les Berbères.

La djellaba, longue robe à capuchon, est le vêtement traditionnel des hommes en Algérie. Les femmes sont nombreuses à mettre un voile (hijab) en public. Celui-ci peut recouvrir seulement la partie inférieure du visage ou tout le visage, ne laissant alors qu’une ouverture pour les yeux. Dans le Souf, à l’est du pays, le voile ne laisse apparaître qu’un œil. Les femmes berbères, quant à elles, ne sont pas voilées et portent souvent de longues jupes et des corsages.

5046,"Is the longest European summit in history historic? The answer is yes. Not so much in terms of its results on the suface. The recovery plan is an extraordinary budget of EUR 750 billion to be spent over three or four years. That is an increase of about 50% on the ordinary budget, which is just over EUR 1 000 billion every seven years. This extraordinary budget is supposed to be a non-renewable one-shot funding. Appreciated in the medium term, this recovery plan will therefore be marginal in terms of its amount.

From this point of view, it is less historic than the famous Delors I and II packages. Decided at the Fontainebleau European Council in June 1984, at the same time as the appointment of Jacques Delors to the Commission, who was responsible for putting them together for implementation, the packages referred to the reform of the ordinary European budget: the aim was to take note of the doubling of expenditure between 1980 and 1987, to invent a new development and growth policy aimed at the relatively less developed territories, and to sustain a structural increase in revenue corresponding to this doubling of expenditure.

The ""recovery plan"" is historic because with it Europe is becoming a State. Indeed, it will be financed by a European debt. A territorial entity that issues treasury bills to finance its own debt is called a State.

What makes the recovery plan historic:

We are rightly talking about this European plan of 750 billion euros but it should be analysed in the light of the national recovery plans adopted in response to Covid-19: their total, colossal sum, amounts to EUR 2 300 billion. They are only possible because of the guarantee of the European Central Bank and its global credibility. This is particularly true for France, Spain and Italy. If there were no ECB, there would be no national plans and no European plan.

Let us summarise. Central bank, plus debt, plus Treasury bills: these are the attributes of a State. Suddenly, we realise that the European State exists - and that it exists not as a substitute, but in addition to the Member States which are Member States of the European Union.

Indeed, if the European Union is now a State, it is not a superstate that substitutes for the 27 Member States that make it up, but a State that includes them. One could say that the EU is still 28: the 27 taken separately and the 27 together make 1. Finally, the European State is understood with the famous maxim of Alexandre Dumas' Three Musketeers: one for all and all for one. All the more so as it is highly likely that the Commission, the European Parliament and the Member States will use it to defend a new way of conceiving the European budget in general and to change the way the EU is financed. This would not be the first time that a political measure that started out as an exceptional measure has been sustained.

Commentators rightly point out that some of the most prosperous countries in the EU have shown themselves to be reluctant to show solidarity with the countries most affected by the Covid-19 epidemic. These are the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Finland. That is correct. It is worth noting that as a price for their adherence to the recovery plan, they have asked for a reduction in their contribution to the ordinary EU budget for the next seven years (a little over €1 000 billion), and that certain lines of the latter have been cut (such as the European Defence Fund or Erasmus Mundus). This is also true.

However, the whole picture needs to be looked at and put into perspective over the medium and long term. In Sweden, which is one of the most affected countries in terms of the number of deaths per capita, the Swedish government's position is based not on a lack of solidarity, but on a certain vision of public policies based on labour market flexicurity and individual responsibility on the one hand, and the refusal of assistance coupled with a strong welfare state on the other. The Netherlands, for its part, is a country that practises tax dumping and where public debt is low, but private debt, especially household debt, is so high that it makes it one of the most indebted states in the world. Every European country always manages to see itself as more virtuous than its neighbours and partners. There is therefore debate, with its majority and minority, as in any deliberative forum.

But, all in all, there is general agreement on this historic milestone. This means that today, while Europeans as a whole are still rich and prosperous societies on a global scale in the 21st century, they are relatively less and less so, especially when compared to the Japanese or the Chinese, for example, or even gradually to India, and probably tomorrow to Indonesia. In order to try to continue to remain rich and prosperous in a world that has changed a great deal, Europeans, who are highly interdependent with each other economically, socially and in terms of values, must become a state on a European scale as well. That is what is happening.

Indeed, Europeans do not form a nation. They form a society. As a whole, and on a global scale, this society sees itself as an inhabitable territory (concerned about the link with nature and the planet) that promotes its way of life and its unique social bond. The combination of the departure of the religious, secularization, intolerance to the death penalty and the prohibition of abortion, the attachment to pluralism, civil peace and pacification, to the welfare state and to the autonomy and freedom of the individual is a good illustration of this.

Thus, the notion of society underlines the specificity of Europe. Europeans have been building a state that corresponds to this society for only a few decades: for seven decades, national governments have been tremendously civilised in building this European state. The recovery plan is a decisive milestone in this historic development, which has been taking place without fuss or fury, at low noise, for half a century.

This advent of the European state is part of the history of the state in Europe, which stretches back more than ten centuries. This history includes many forms of statehood, and a plurality of states, each with its own singularity, as specific and different as, for example, the Holy Roman Empire, the Republic of Venice, the Polish-Lithuanian Kingdom, Portugal or the United Provinces.

The young EU could be described as a ""baroque state"". Baroque, the great European artistic movement, is opposed to classicism by bending rules and subverting forms, mixing genres and resorting to the exception. This is the case of the EU, which escapes the traditional classification of political systems as territorial state entities and is distinguished by its stimulating singularity.

Based on state cultures inherited from a long history and a fragmented political geography, contemporary Europeans are inventing the mutualisation of sovereignty and the mutualisation of territory. The agreement of the Heads of State and Government will have to be voted on by the 27 national parliaments - themselves networked with the European Parliament and the parliaments of local states like the Belgian or Spanish communities and the German Länder. This mutualisation is democratic: it is deliberate, voluntary and negotiated, in contrast to the empires and royal and then national conquests of the past two millennia. Europeans do not form a nation, but a society. For the past few decades they have been building a State that corresponds to it, pluralist, unprecedented and forward-looking.

5077,"&gt; My daughter is 17 years old. I used to explain the world to her. For some time now, she's been explaining her world to me. I've decided to listen.
&gt; 
&gt; MOTHER: The EU countries seem to be moving a little closer together. In any case, for the first time, there will be joint debts to fund Corona aid.
&gt; 
&gt; But there's something funny. The Hungarian and Polish prime ministers are celebrating themselves for preventing the payments from being tied to constitutional conditions. Which begs the question of meaning. Will it be enforced or not?
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that detailed arrangements have yet to be agreed.
&gt; 
&gt; Then the aid can be put to good use in order to force Poland and Hungary to adopt democracy. I would formulate the conditions for all money payments from the EU in such a way that the money only flows if, for example, freedom of the press is respected and judges are appointed according to reasonable criteria. If normal democratic standards are observed. I do not see why people should be thrown money at people who do something else with it. Of course it is stupid for the citizens if they do not receive financial aid. But it doesn't help them either if they have to live in a dictatorship.
&gt; 
&gt; There is much criticism of this compromise. One of them is that the link with the rule of law is only symbolic politics. In the end, it would be money poured out of the pot.
&gt; 
&gt; But money can also be used as leverage. If you do not pay it out in the first place, if it is not clear that it is being used correctly, it might work. It is also a sign for countries that have undemocratic tendencies. The EU should finally take action.
&gt; 
&gt; You're probably right. But ultimately, it's a compulsion to do good over money.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, money is simply the best lever. Of course, this applies not only to Corona aid, but to all grants.
&gt; 
&gt; But it is blackmail.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, of course. But it's good if it works.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, it's classic paternalism. Like with little kids. The only way you'll be able to stay up late tonight I'm not comfortable with that. I'd like to see a more educational approach. If people don't want to, it'll be difficult in the long run and always be an authoritarian relationship. You're not behaving, so you get nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; But the alternative is that states within the EU become dictatorships. Several million people will be affected.
&gt; 
&gt; But then you have to formulate a clear limit.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, the EU as a whole must formulate rules. Of course, in the end it must not be just Germany and France that decide who gets the money. But at the moment I see no other effective option. But I don't think that everyone can do what they want. Then they cannot be part of the EU.
&gt; 
&gt; But in the long run it is difficult to act authoritatively. A positive way must also be found. It's very idealistic, I know, but I still want a common ideal and that's what you get if you talk a lot to each other and listen to the other person. In the end, perhaps everyone will realize that in the end, insisting on one's own advantage is of no use to anyone.

5096,"Firstly in 2nd link you linked about partition of Poland, the term ""colonisation"" is never mentioned. . As i already said, in one way or the other, colonisation was present almost everywhere in Europe. It literaly doesn't make a difference, Poland was always 95%+ homogenous society post 1945. The impact of colonidation there was a lot lower than in Baltics or Croatia for example.

Secondly comparison of Yugoslavia and EE is sily. Yugoslavia was a federation with a goal of creating new (Yugoslav) national identity. Warsaw pact was dominated by Soviets, but national identities of member countries were never questioned. All those countries had clear national identities after and before the collapse of Soviet block. 

Thirdly war in Yugoslavia was not about ""reforming or progressing an identity"". It was the oposite, identities were strong and tolerance so low that ethnic clensing was used to create a. homogenous areas, b. to match majority areas with state borders. Aditionaly it was caused by imperial ambitions of Serbian ultranationalists. National identity in both Poland, EE and most of Yugoslavia were formed in 19th century with few untied exceptions. 

*""Poland deserves that empathy as it battles its history of colonization, communist control, and catholic nationalism.""*

Poland diesn't battle anything unique. All of this was experianced by all of the Baltic states, Cezchia, Slovenia, Croatia etc. Some of this countries had worse recent history than Poland and I don't see them backsliding into oppresive states. Aditionaly untill 5 years ago Poland was on forefront of European liberalism, obviously all the 'historical complexes' didn't impact it then. 

This patheticism is so ilogical. What is EU supposed to do?

During the German occupation from 1941-1944, around one thousand Jews were murdered in Estonia. Which is absolutely brutal, but did not leave the same kind of mark on the national conscience as for example the June deportation in june 1941 (one week before Operation Barbarossa) where 1% of Estonian population was deported to Siberia - they were considered to be sentenced to death. When the Soviets returned in 1944, their behavior did not improve, by starting a new wave of deportations, thrice the size of the first, followed by nearly 50 years of occupation.

5128,"Balts in general, I don´t know. For Estonians.. difficult to say, since there is no-one alive from that time and Czarist Russia ruled here for 200 years - during which a lot of different things took place. From my understanding, the contemporary Estonians at least in the later part of Czarist Russia generally thought that: Czar is OK, but the Russian state is poor and inefficient. And that the real rule in Estonia was never really in the hands of Russian czar, but local German nobles. This was also objectively true for the most part of Czarist Russia´s rule in Estonia.

And that of course again depends on the Czar, there were good czars and there were bad ones. During the 1880s and 1890s Russian czar Alexander III started his Russificiation campaign in Estonia, which meant both that it limited the previous German overlordship in Estonia, by bringing the area under tighter Russian control, and also created bad blood between Estonians and Russians, since it was an attempt at ethnic cleansing. 

But I would say, that very largely speaking, Estonians generally saw Russians during the czarist regime as fellow sufferers, that suffered under a poor and inefficient, yet often brutal Russian State, while the czar himself often had a slight aura of ""trying to make things better"", unless the czar was Alexander III.",,/r/europe/comments/he9gmt/today_is_the_victory_day_in_estonia_celebrating/fzdkx9h/,sanderudam,1595827774

5175,"Translation :

On July 25, 1932, the Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact was signed in Moscow.  It strengthened Poland's international position in Europe, especially towards Berlin.  It also created conditions for further improvement of relations with the Soviet Union, which was important from the point of view of Polish political and economic interests.  The pact was broken by the Soviet side on September 17, 1939, when the Red Army entered the territory of Poland.

 The signing of the Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact was a consequence of the changes that had been taking place in European politics since the mid-1920s.

After the conference in Locarno in 1925, during which Germany signed the so-called  The ""Rhine treaty"", in which they recognized the inviolability of their western borders with France and Belgium, without doing the same to their eastern neighbors - Poland and Czechoslovakia, the security and durability of the Polish-German border were put into question.  Additionally, Locarno was becoming a threat to the strategic alliance with France for Warsaw.

 Paris was more and more ready to sacrifice the interests of its allies in Central and Eastern Europe to improve relations with Germany.

The agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany, signed in 1926, was also disturbing from the point of view of Poland's security, in which both states guaranteed neutrality in the event of any conflict.

 Polish-Soviet relations in this period continued to be bad.  Moscow, describing the rule of Marshal Piłsudski as fascist, accused Warsaw, among others  for participation in the creation of an anti-Soviet bloc under the dictates of England.

 The Soviets also supported Lithuanian territorial claims against Poland, signing a political treaty with Lithuania that was contrary to the Treaty of Riga.

 Polish-Soviet relations worsened even more after the murder of Piotr Wojków, the Soviet ambassador to Warsaw by a Russian émigré in 1927.  According to Moscow, this was evidence that the Polish authorities supported the subversive activities of Russian military organizations.  In retaliation, Moscow stepped up its anti-Polish campaign.  An example of this was the staged trial of a Polish priest from Kiev, Teofil Skalski, accused of espionage.  Despite the lack of evidence, the priest was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

In 1928, the autonomous Polish districts in Belarus and Ukraine were liquidated, their inhabitants were deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan.  Those who ""voluntarily"" did not request a change of nationality were arrested and sent to labor camps.

 In its foreign policy, Poland sought to strengthen the order based on the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Riga in various ways.

 In 1928, together with other countries, it signed the so-called  Briand-Kellog Pact on the renunciation of war as a way of regulating international problems.

 A year later, responding to Moscow's proposal, Poland joined Estonia, Latvia, Romania and the Soviet Union to the so-called  Litvinov Protocol, which concerned the immediate implementation of the provisions of the Briand-Kellog Pact, recognizing its provisions even if it would not be finally ratified.

 However, in view of the difficult international situation, Polish diplomacy began to look for new security guarantees based on bilateral agreements and arrangements.

 Stanisław Sierpowski wrote about these concepts: ""The expression of these tendencies was the conclusion of non-aggression pacts, which were an attempt to adapt collective agreements to individual needs, which - such as the LN Pact or the Briand-Kellog Pact - were based on the idea of ​​peaceful settlement of disputes and conflicts without resorting to  to violence ”.

The international situation prevailing in the early 1930s began to persuade Soviet politicians to agree with Warsaw.  Moscow was worried about the increasingly aggressive and nationalist political atmosphere in Germany, related to the successes of the Nazi movement and its anti-communist nature.  Stalin also feared hostile actions by England, France and Germany, observing their rapprochement in the League of Nations.  He was also concerned about Polish-British diplomatic contacts and the possibility of Poland joining a possible anti-Soviet bloc.

 The situation in the Far East, related to the offensive by Japanese militarism, which threatened not only China but also the Soviet Union, also caused great concern in the Kremlin.

 Warsaw also noticed the growing nationalist mood in Germany and the growing influence of Hitler and the Nazi party.  In this situation, she was also interested in an agreement with Moscow.  Polish diplomacy hoped that the signing of the pact with the Soviet Union could not only be a breakthrough in mutual relations, but could also strengthen Poland's position in Central Europe and increase its chances of establishing favorable relations with Berlin.

 On July 25, 1932, MP Stanisław Patek and Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Nikolai Kriestinskij, signed the Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact in Moscow.

 Both sides stated that they renounced war as ""instruments of national politics in their mutual relations, and undertook mutually to refrain from any aggressive actions or from attacking one another, both individually and jointly with other powers.  Any act of rape violating the integrity and inviolability of the territory or the political independence of the other Contracting Party shall be deemed to be an act contrary to the obligations of this article, even if these acts were performed without a declaration of war and with the avoidance of all its possible manifestations ”.

In the treaty of the Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union also undertook not to participate in any agreements hostile to the other party and stated that they did not participate in such agreements at present.

 In the event of an attack by a third country on one of the signatories of the pact, the other party undertook not to assist the aggressor.  On the other hand, in the event of an attack by one of the signatories of a third country, the other party could terminate the treaty without prior notice.

 The pact was concluded for three years, with an option to extend it for another two.  However, on May 5, 1934, it was extended to December 31, 1945.

After the signing of the Polish-Soviet pact in July 1932, Polish-Soviet relations clearly improved for some time.  Both parties wanted to spread the word about the agreement.  In this way, Polish diplomacy wanted to influence the correction of the policy pursued primarily by Berlin, but also by Paris.

 When describing Polish-Soviet relations in the interwar period, Wojciech Materski assessed the effectiveness of actions taken by Warsaw at that time: ""The belief that only an independent politics, shaping in the world the image of a strong state, capable of taking care of its own security, is able to really ensure it, can  in the perspective of later events, it should be read as megalomania.  However, it is necessary to look at this issue in the aspect of the 1932 optics: the ineffectiveness of the current political line, the increasing threat from Germany, the growing power of the USSR, the capitulation of France, accurately assessed by Piłsudski as an ineffective mechanism of the League of Nations.  If Beck was even subjectively convinced that he was in charge of the foreign policy of a great power, objectively speaking, it had a positive, not negative impact on the effectiveness of his actions. ""

 The Polish-Soviet non-aggression treaty signed on July 25, 1932 did not protect the Polish state from the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact and the attack by the Soviet Union on September 17, 1939.

 Assessing the activities of Polish diplomacy in the context of the Soviet attack, Wojciech Materski wrote: “Certainly, the Second Republic of Poland could not, in the balance of its foreign policy, including eastern policy, achieve more than the internationalization of its security.  There was no other chance in the German-Russian claws. """,Poland,/r/europe/comments/hymp7b/on_this_day_in_1932_poland_and_soviet_union_have/fzdnk9t/,iwanttosaysmth,1595829998

Built in 1468, rebuilt in 1620 after Earthquake damage etc and after Greece got independence, its minarets (or minaret, unsure) were destroyed (they were made out of stone mind you, requires some heavy work.) the pencil works on the dome and the writing plates were removed, and the interlocking wooden pulpit inside was destroyed.

Once it became the property of the National Bank of Greece it was used for for military services. Afterwards it was declared ""protected monument"" yet still was sold to private sector only 2 years after said declaration. And it has been used by private sector for a lot of shit like shopping centre and cinema, which damaged the building a lot while getting a lot of modifications.

It was 2006 when the abuse was ""said"" to be stopped. I do not know how it looks like now.

Now that is *worse* than demolishing but if you insist on being like ""nope not demolished so doesnt count"" then:

The Faik Pasha Mosque - turned into a church, abandoned, used as a bar-pavilion and now lays in ruins.

I can give more than ""one"" example if you wish to continue this ""Turks bad, Greeks angels"" narrative.

Neither side was nice to each other, nor to their culture for a long time and still goes on. Mosques are still attacked in Greece by graffities and what-not especially if there is something Turk related happening in Greece (like, dare they win some local election.).

I won't defend Turkey's bad actions, i however will not let anyone say ""There is no equality of vengeful hate."" either. Equally bad people existed, still do in both ethnic groups and do have power in government level. You cannot hope to get rid of this on one side if you don't acknowledge the bad stuff on both sides.

&gt; Perhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of John Walker after a visit to the island of Jura (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764.[239] He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with ""exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs"") and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a ""worm"" with a body which is ""of a reddish colour and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side"" that ""penetrates the skin"". Many people from this area of Great Britain emigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century.

Thus, maybe... but since detection and monitoring have improved, anyone experimenting on the general public runs a high risk of getting discovered by civilian scientists.

I am not directly saying to you, please don't get me wrong. But some people curse subbreditors because they don't verbally support them. I asked them what are their purpose, too. Some Greek guys complained about cats, bridges or photographs posted from Turkey. Probably they didn't want Turks to seem friendly or normal. Most of them call help against Turkey.

I only see similar reasons. Provocation, propaganda and racism. If the intention was to let this subbredit know the news, probably we would see these kind of news maybe weekly.

5469,"In another post you referred to them as ""they forcefully left"". They wouldn't left forcefully, if they hadn't to use force in the first place.

But that's not the point. You said later, when you got angrier, that you are sorry and you don't know what to say next. You do not have to say even that. You don't have to be sorry, if you were not directly involved. It's not your fault and wouldn't be, even if your parents were on the first front line.

But for better or worse, you are a Serb and that leaves you with some responsibility for your own history. We won't ever get far in that department, if you dismiss everything with ""we were provoked"", ""they started it"" and stuff like that. It's a Russian way of thinking that leads to nowhere. They are always provoked and attacked, yet somehow it's their troops on the foreign soil and not ever a single soldier on a Russian land.

I finished Political Science and that means, I had to read at least some books about our own history. Only after I started to reach for the outside perspective, when I realized that every single questionable act in our books is idealized and justified. What I'm getting to, is that every country has bias in their own books and there is no reason to believe, Serbia isn't the same. So maybe there is no truth to saying, that EU hates Serbia. Serbia is the very center of Europe, always was a part of Europe and always will be. For better or worse, everyone wants Serbia inside the EU. Eventually but that's the only reasonable outcome.

But this things really happened. Some nastier things I read in my life are about Gorazde, Visegrad, Srebrenica and many others. Claiming that those happened merely because of a revenge is simplifying the fact and is not doing just for the victims. People killed another people just because they were told to. Because propaganda created the image, that they're not worth of living. People who studied this even a bit realize, that atrocities also happened on Bosnian and Croatian side but unfortunately, Serbia took a major part in all of that.",Opole (Poland),/r/europe/comments/hy4lud/citizens_support_for_serbias_accession_to_the_eu/fzcn03m/,machine4891,1595805825

And the government was put in the dilemma of choosing between keeping the economy open or closing the country to a virus whose consequences were not fully known.

This decision was also under the scrutiny of the opposition, if the virus hadn't been as impactful they would have said that the government had closed the economy and ruined the country.

I won't speak for Hungary but in case of Poland you tend to forget that we joined 16 years ago. For majority of this time Poland was put as an example and even in these days general pro-EU sentiment in Poland is massive. Maybe even the greatest among all EU nations. EU reshaped Poland in every way imaginable, not only on economical level. If you think what happens now is bad, I can assure you it could have been way worse, without EU being on mind of everyone for all that time.

Now, last 5 years are rough for us in opposition here. I can only tell you, that sadly these things happen but also, they happen for a reason. Usually much more complicated, than it looks on the surface. Trump came after 8 years of Obama, his absolute opposite. Brexit happened. LePen in France. Rutte in Netherlands. And for all of those populists trails were broken by the very own EU Jorg Haider. Democracy is weak and it can be abused.

5718,"Every bastion is designed so that it can be supported by raking fire (gunshots travelling in parallell to the walls, which was the most deadly) from the nearby bastions, with abslutely no dead angles (where attackers would have been unseen from defensive positions).

By making each ""point"" a projecting bastion you give ideal positions from which cannon and muskets can fire alongside the wall.

So to get inside you'd have to climb the wall (which is angled so that enemy cannonfire won't topple the wall, but still steep enough that it's really hard to climb it), while people from at least one defensive position (sometimes several) are shooting at you. The most projecting parts of the fortification (the tips of the bastions) are extremely narrow (so it's not easy to get a large number of men up there) and any attacks would have to face the fire from not just one tower (which would have been the case in medieval designs) but three large bastions (the one they're attacking and the two supporting bastions).

The moat is also designed so that the outer bank is tall enough to protect the base of the fortress from cannonfire (so the wall can't be levelled even by the fiercest of cannonfire) but slopes gently upwards so that it provides no cover.

The number of bastions is determined by the necessity that the distance from the firing positon on nearby bastions to the bastions tip should be no longer than the effective range of the muskets and cannons defending the fort.

So a small starfort (like this. There are quadratic starforts, but they lose a lot of defensive value with less than 5 bastions) had 5 bastions, while a larger could have...well, there really is no upper limit except cost-effectivness.",,/r/europe/comments/hy5zy7/fort_bourtange_1593_northeastern_netherlands/fzbefyc/,fiendishrabbit,1595782566

Well firstly, they're not. But even if they were, that would be disasterous.

The reason they're not is that they're merely covering the mosaics with curtains, instead of plastering them like in Ottoman times.

If they returned it to it's previous state...god, that would be ISIS levels of cultural vandalism.

So, no, I didn't play myself.

&gt;There has been prayers inside the HS grounds for 30 years, as you just said. People have also been praying inside the HS too,

The first part of this is correct, the second part is wrong.

People have been praying on the **grounds**, yes, but not **in** the building itself. If you tried praying in the Hagia Sophia a year ago, Christian or Islamic, you'd be escorted out by the museum staff. There's video of this happening if you don't want take my word for it.

So, no my timeline isn't wrong either. You seem to have a bad habit of like, insulting someone for something and then doing what you insulted them for yourself afterwards.

&gt;and the call to prayer has been blasted from there

Yeah, call to prayer for OTHER Mosques. Bad faith example.

&gt;And regarding your last point...do you know how curtains work?

Ok, so firstly, the carpets are permanent. They're not going to be rolled back out when the prayers are done, so the floor of the church is gone for all intents and purposes.

Secondly, the way these curtains have been installed is extremely gaudy, even when they're pulled back.

Thirdly, this curtain installation was done without consulting UNESCO, and done in 14 days (which is way too short a timespan for this kind of building).

This dates way back to when (West)Berlin was surrounded by the GDR. Berliners (maybe quite naturally) had the feeling of: ""One small village of indomitable Berliners still holds out against the invadors, a little village sourounded by...""

Fun fact: (West)Berliners were the first that termed us in the Bundesrepublik ""Wessis"" or ""Wessiland"". So way before the Unification the term Wessi existed and additionally in the 90's the term Ossis came to being also.

Berlin was also a place were one could avoid the military draft. So let's say a very special sort of left-wing(men), that weren't social enough to do the possible alternative (national) service also found a home in Berlin.

Now put all those together with the Left-wing-[Nomenklatura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenklatura) of East-Berlin and you get the political Amalgam of todays Berlin.

The term Swabian is probably used, because among us Germans, the Swabians are considered to have even more than the usual bunch of German characteristics.
