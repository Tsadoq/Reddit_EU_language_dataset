Sure. The Treaty says an armed attack is an armed attack

&gt; on the territory of any of the Parties in Europe or North America, on the Algerian Departments of France^2, on the territory of Turkey or on the Islands under the jurisdiction of any of the Parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer;

2 invalid since 1962

&gt; on the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of the Parties, when in or over these territories or any other area in Europe in which occupation forces of any of the Parties were stationed on the date when the Treaty entered into force or the Mediterranean Sea or the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer.

But alliances shouldn't have a scoreboard like that, it should be allies that help each other without looking at the ""score"" and instead helping each other when needed because that is what allies do.  From this poll at least, it seems many of our allies would be perfectly fine to watch our utter destruction.  I think Americans need to wake up to the fact that our love for Europe is not reciprocated to a large degree for a lot of countries.  That does not mean we are enemies, but it certainly suggests America would be wise to adjust to this new reality and quit with the starry eyed love of Europe as it is an unrequited feeling.  And judging from the comments from many Europeans, I would have to guess this poll is fairly accurate.  

So, with all of this information, I think serious discussions about the US leaving NATO should begin sometime soon.  We could still have alliances with countries like Britain that has proven to be a valuable and capable ally, but we should mitigate our operations with Germany and develop a more formal relationship where nothing is really expected from each other except trade.",,/r/europe/comments/d28k7q/poll_whose_side_should_your_country_take_in_a/ezv1k7v/,JakeAAAJ,1568164945
159,"US emission standards are all about clean air, localised pollution. Diesel is actually better for CO2, which is a global issue, not local. They are worse for local pollution.

The US has been hardcore about tackling localised pollution like smog since the creation of the EPA and the Clean Air Act around 1970 and US cities have MUCH better air quality than European ones (check AirVisual or the WHO air quality database). But CO2 is invisible and a different matter, and the US emits more of that.

&gt;Diesel was promoted as a more environmentally friendly fuel as part of the [EU’s response](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-98-734_en.htm?locale=en) to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide (CO₂). Diesel engines are “lean-burn”, meaning they use less fuel and more air to get the [same performance](http://www.air-quality.org.uk/26.php) as a petrol engine.

&gt;So, while diesel fuel contains [slightly more carbon](https://people.exeter.ac.uk/TWDavies/energy_conversion/Calculation%20of%20CO2%20emissions%20from%20fuels.htm) (2.68kg CO₂/litre) than petrol (2.31kg CO₂/litre), overall CO₂ emissions of a diesel car tend to be lower. In use, on average, this equates to around 200g CO₂/km for petrol and 120g CO₂/km for diesel.

However, in both examples, NATO went after countries that were not Russian allies. So how do these interventions make NATO likely to take actions against Russian allies specifically today? It would seem that it is more likely that NATO allies will agree to take aggressive actions against states that don't have equally dangerous militaries rather than kicking off the one conflict that NATO was formed to prevent - another reason it is a defensive alliance. 

That being said, the USSR invaded multiple countries that were within the Warsaw Pact - like Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. That shows the Russians do have a history and a willingness to invade neighbours as a means of power projection (recently Georgia and Ukraine). The more recent interventions look a LOT like the power projection of NATO in the Balkans. 

Today, much of Central Europe (including Poland, Hungary, the Czechs, and the Slovaks) are all in NATO. There are examples of Russian intervention/invasion in these nations.

You will find like 99 people speaking English to 1 speaking Russian in my age group. So that tells you about the influence.

I agree that the situation is different for older people. I would say that you would have to be at least 15 years old at 1989 to be closer to Russians culturally.

&gt;it would be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland save
with the consent of a majority of its people.

Indeed I've always argued that the Northern Irish should be given the opportunity to choose between the two backstop versions. The EU has shown little regard for the expression of their will by failing to propose a local referendum, which, in my view, reveals the EU's technocratic habits and nature.

However, [I've just found out](http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/learning/history/stateapart/agreement/agreement/support/ba_c091.shtml) that the GFA

&gt;is a masterpiece of ambiguity, violating all rules of legal drafting and testifying to the political nature of the document

because it doesn't specify who exercises the right to self-determination: whether the people of Northern Ireland or the people of the island of Ireland.

Moreover, apparently NI wasn't fully incorporated into the UK since the options of

&gt;full incorporation into the United Kingdom, full and permanent joint sovereignty, and Ulster Independence, are ruled out for the time being and until the Agreement is positively and uncategorically rejected by both peoples.

Also worthy of mention is the fact that the NI Act is in force

&gt;notwithstanding any other previous enactment.

Such previous enactments may include the Acts of Union given that they weren't specified.

&gt;While the Belfast Agreement and Northern Ireland Act arguably provide little change from earlier statements as to Northern Ireland's constitutional status, such as in the Northern Ireland Constitution Act of 1973 and the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, they do provide a clear procedure whereby the Union with Britain could be ended.

Other tidbits that I found [here](https://theconversation.com/brexit-is-a-rejection-of-the-good-friday-agreement-for-peace-in-northern-ireland-114965) are likewise interesting:

&gt;although the largest Nationalist Party in Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein, fields candidates for parliamentary elections, the party’s seven MPs refuse to take their seats because they do not acknowledge the sovereignty of the U.K. in Northern Ireland.

&gt;With the Nationalist side not represented in Parliament, the Unionist position became, by default, Northern Ireland’s position.

&gt;The DUP has never supported the Good Friday Agreement.

As a final remark I would say that a hard border would probably be a more serious contravention of the agreement than would a sea border for the purposes of tariffs and regulations, if that were to be the case.

397,"I was gonna check for inflation references in the article and raise that too, but what you have is also misleading:

* You're comparing wage percentage growth over 11 years to one year.

* The time period you're choosing is immediately prior to the [European debt crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_financial_crisis) hitting; that behavior is from the tip of a bubble.

* The dollar has generally strengthened against other currencies over that time period.  You'd see something similar for the euro over the past decade.  The dollar isn't a super-volatile currency, but it it's worth pointing out that it *does* move, and just treating it as an unmoving baseline is misleading here.  Here's the [10 year chart of the euro against the US dollar](https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=EUR&amp;to=USD&amp;view=10Y) and the [pound against the US dollar](https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=GBP&amp;to=USD&amp;view=10Y).

    |Currency|Acronym|Ratio to USD 10 years back|Ratio now|Percentage change|
    |-|-|-:|-:|-:|

    |Swedish krona|SEK|0.14543|0.10272|-29%|

398,"You seem very fixated on Muslims. I was actually thinking about the brutal oppression of the Tamil Hindu minority and the following war where Tamil women were mass raped and hospitals bombed, among many other horrible crimes. If you're interested look into it. Will probably be one of the worst things you'll hear about in your life. I wouldn't eat beforehand. The root cause had been a decades old conflict between Buddhists and the Hindu minority. [Look at this for example:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_July)

&gt;While travelling on a bus when a mob laid siege to it, passengers watched as a small boy was hacked 'to limb-less death'. The bus driver was ordered to give up a Tamil. He pointed out a woman who was desperately trying to erase the mark on her forehead—called a kumkum—as the thugs bore down on her. The woman's belly was ripped open with a broken bottle and she was immolated as people clapped and danced. In another incident, two sisters, one eighteen and one eleven, were decapitated and raped, the latter 'until there was nothing left to violate and no volunteers could come forward', after which she was burned. While all this was going on, a line of Buddhist monks appeared, arms flailing, their voices raised in a delirium of exhortation, summoning the Sinhalese to put all Tamils to death.  

But yeah, anti-Muslim violence works too if you like.

I'm not here to debate of the validity of their claims, it's completely irrelevant and I can't even believe this is discussed as a way to try and stop Brexit. UK citizens have voted and they want to leave the EU, they should be able to do so regardless of what's going to happen to them afterward. The simple fact it's such a hassle is proof enough the EU is overreaching already.

&gt;That's not what the leave campaign said. At all. They promised gold mountains.

If you are only waking up to how rotten the political sphere is then you are either very young or very naive. None of them represent the people quite like the people themselves. 

My bet is they probably tried to muddy the river so that it would be legitimate to cancel Brexit further down because in the end none of them truly wanted to leave. Why do you think there has been such a move against pretty much every one of them recently? 

&gt;It's quite easy to argue against that idea because it's false. The UK is part of the EU and decides on the EU budget and on their own budget. Brussels does not dictate what the UK can do with their budget. This idea of the EU as some kind of evil enemy is ridiculous.

624,"&gt;Nationalism has been around in some shape or form for thousands of years. 

Not in the same scope by far. Nationalism means something greater than any Roman General's wet dream. There was no draft in those days, national gaurds didn't exist... it's a banding together unlike any Empire has ever scene. That's just military. No power in the past could even the depths of Nationalism. Do you realize that an Empire like Persia had to deal with thousands upon thousands of different kingdoms, with their own individual sense of pride? They weren't Persian as so much as the were Trojans.

&gt;A supranational entity like that would break apart in civil war as soon as it started. You’d have to deal with all the different western groups, all the Muslim countries, all the backwards African countries, Asia, etc...

That's exactly what happened with the rise of Nationalism. Do you think that every German Duchy or Kingdom or Republic identified with the greater Germany? No. Some were more ""backwards"" than others i.e. rural others were more industrialized. My former point remains, people saw themselves as their little regions, Sparta vs Greece. Also what you said was kind of racist but I'll let that go.

&gt;The EU barely works just with European countries. Why do you think the UK is leaving?

Is that what you think? Ha. The UK is leaving due to half the nation is regressive. The people who voted Brexit believe the UK is still the nation in strongest in the world.

668,"&gt; Why not now?

Because the government is trying to bypass Parliament to railroad through a no-deal brexit against the wishes of the people.
Because he lied to the queen about the reasons for this.

&gt; Due to the timings, there's is time for Parliament to debate any new deal after prorogue. Yes it's convenient that it gives less time for Parliament to block Brexit, which is a good thing considering that's all they've been trying to do for the last week. 

They're trying to block a no-deal brexit, which is what the vast majority of people want and what is good for the country. The government is answerable to Parliament, they can't just do whatever they like.

&gt; Nobody campaigned on no deal because how we left the EU wasn't on the ballot. You could also argue that no-one voted for endless delaying of Brexit either. A purge is necessary if MPs aren't going to respect the wishes of the electorate. 

We had several votes on withdrawal already, the conservatives didn't vote for it. No deal wasn't mentioned during the campaign, in fact staying in the single market was often given as a real possibility.

&gt; Then you've misunderstood how SO24 works. That we're in unprecedented times isn't a good enough reason to break convention multiple times. It's a disgrace that the opposition thinks they can control the government but refuse to call an election. 

Have I? Point out the part that makes this wrong? The government should also not break convention by proroguing, standing a candidate against the speaker, threatening to break the law or sacking members for disagreeing with a minister.

&gt; The good reason being that he's partisan.

Show me a shred of evidence of this. He is giving power to Parliament, nothing more.

&gt; The backstop and the border, the same part that everyone is complaining about. 

So what is your solution?

&gt; What makes you think the UK would accept that deal after leaving with no deal?

Because the EU absolutely will not deal with us until we accept continuity on the island of Ireland, citizens rights and regulatory harmony.

Part of the reason is also that there are surprisingly few border crossings (\~40) for such a large border as Norway and Sweden share. I understand NI and Ireland have more border crossings (\~210).

So we have around 10 border crossings that have customs stations and 30 crossings without. But if you carry goods you HAVE to use a border crossing with a customs station. A semi-educated guess would be waiting times of 30 minutes to 3 hours for the average trailer crossing the border.

For personal transport you MAY be picked out for a control. I'd say there is a 5-10% chance to be stopped for a control IF you cross the border where there's a customs station. The other 30 crossings are monitored by cameras I believe.

So, that's pretty much what you'd have to deal with in a ""Norway"" style border. Poor forgotten Sweden.",,/r/europe/comments/d23q5g/perfect_brexit_metaphor/eztekv1/,Gaudern,1568128469

No. Neutral countries don't sell or supply belligerants with military goods. Soviet Union support of German war machine [was massive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GermanImports_USSRPerCent.jpg). Germany was lacking of a lot of raw materials, and was effectively blocked by Great Britain. Without Soviet support the war in the west would be basically impossible.

859,"&gt; How is that supposed to work without a border?

Immigration is easy, the UK and RoI already have a Common Travel Area separate from Schengen, both sides just check passports for the right-to-work before hiring people. The issue is customs and trade, which no-one wants to admit can be solved in the same way - have Irish customs agents in major UK ports and British customs agents in major Irish ports, and check goods based on destination (the same principle as Le Touquet). 

&gt; And if what the UK wants needs a border, where should it be drawn

It's not going to be drawn. The EU thinks it is, but neither side is going to do so. 

&gt; but that doesn't sit well with Brexiteers' sense of entitlement

You seriously don't see the issue of a foreign power placing an internal border? Or a treaty that could lock the UK under EU law into perpetuity? 

&gt; If we are to continue trading goods (the EU is where the majority of your exports goes and who supports you with a lot of things you don't produce yourself) then there needs to be a common basis of regulations and laws for these would you agree?

No, not in the slightest. Goods exported to the EU can follow EU regulations, and vice versa, but there's no need for the entire economy to follow EU law just to satisfy EU smugness. 

&gt; ruling over the rest of europe, dictating terms to them.

880,"
&gt; In 1935 and 1936, the United States Congress had passed Neutrality Acts to prohibit the U.S. from selling goods to countries at war. The acts were ostensibly to protect the U.S. from falling into another war like World War I. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the acts, although he did not like them because they prohibited the U.S. from helping allies in need.

&gt; Still, the acts were not active unless Roosevelt invoked them, which he did not do in the case of Japan and China. He favored China in the crisis, and by not invoking the 1936 act he could still shuttle aid to the Chinese.

&gt; Not until 1939, however, did the United States begin to directly challenge continued Japanese aggression in China. That year the U.S. announced it was pulling out of the 1911 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with Japan, signaling a coming end to trade with the empire. Japan continued its campaign through China, and in 1940 Roosevelt declared a partial embargo of U.S. shipments of oil, gasoline, and metals to Japan.

&gt; That move forced Japan to consider drastic options. It had no intention of ceasing its imperial conquests, and it was poised to move into French Indochina. With a total American resource embargo likely, Japanese militarists began looking at the oil fields of the Dutch East Indies as possible replacements for American oil. That presented a military challenge, though, because the American-controlled Philippines and the American Pacific Fleet -- based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, -- were between Japan and the Dutch possessions.

&gt; In July 1941, the United States completely embargoed resources to Japan, and it froze all Japanese assets in American entities. The American policies forced Japan to the wall. With the approval of Japanese Emperor Hirohito, the Japanese Navy began planning to attack Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, and other bases in the Pacific in early December to open the route to the Dutch East Indies.

914,"&gt; The reason people wanted to leave the EU is because the EU can force  regulations on countries as part of its trading block, and the people  who make those regulations are unelected by the countries that are  impacted by them. While the trade benefits are significant, the  downsides of losing sovereignty are also huge. Some people are willing  to suffer the pain of the economy stalling a little bit, to make sure  that their country isn't beholden to foreign powers. 

Decisions in the EU are made by 

\- The Council, which is literally the national governments

\- The commission, which is appointed by the national governments and confirmed by parliament

\- The European Parliament, which is elected by the populations of the individual member states.

Which of these bodies is not elected by the countries?

&gt; It's also incredibly goofy to think that the UK, who is an economic and  military power house, will not be able to recover. They still have  trading partners. They can trade with the US, which is also an economic  power house. They don't necessarily need the EU, but the EU very much  needs them. 

The UK might be able to recover - provided that the country will even exist after a hard Brexit, with Scotland and Northern Ireland both wanting to stay in the EU. But is, to use your own phrase, incredibly goofy to suggest, that the UK at 15% the GDP of the EU needs the EU less than the EU needs the UK. Around 50% of UK exports are the EU, meanwhile 8% of EU exports are to the UK. 

Of course the EU would be better off with the UK in the Union, as I European I would very much prefer continued UK membership, but we will get through it. The UK, on the other hand, is about to completely sever ties with its largest trading partner and neighbor. I'm sure the UK (or England-Wales) can get a trade deal with the US, but don't expect it to be in the UK's favour.",,/r/europe/comments/d23q5g/perfect_brexit_metaphor/ezsrwb1/,srosing,1568106202

971,"I mean, by reading what is human capital about in the main report, it is something that makes a lot of sense to measure somehow (though it is likely the calculation can be improved). It is pretty much a measure of productivity of the population, which considers education level/time and years of productivity/life expectancy.

It makes sense, on a intuitive level, that if you have a country with more educated people which work for more years (as they are healthier into a higher age) this is a country which is more productive.  I guess that the human capital measure is one of the main reasons why the whole thing highly correlates with GDP. And it makes a small correction for inequality too, as you have to educate the whole population for that (but I'm still in favour of higher corrections for inequality in the final number). 

From the report:

&gt; In this book the measure of human capital is based on the present value of the expected earnings of the labor force, a measure that is consistent with the concept of capital used for other assets. 

&gt; This measure factors in not only the number of years of schooling completed by workers, but also the earn- ings gains associated with schooling (which implicitly factors in the quality of the learning taking place in school) and how long workers can work (which implicitly accounts for health conditions through life expectancy, among others).

I didn't fully read the report, but I think this can be calculated by looking at how much a person is expected to produce per year of productive year (this is a known number and used a lot for insurance and when designing safety regulations.

Inclusivity doesn't necessitate tearing down everything it means to be straight cis. So yea that is a problem. Not because of a single instance but because of a larger trend.

Like I said before most people dont mind genderswapped roles. People mind the identity politics that caused the genderswap. If there had been a good story behind the genderswap everything would have been cool. But it was already established that genderswaps are *absurdly* rare upon reincarnation, so making the two main timelords female (within a couple seasons) without a good reason is stupid. I mean making the Master female was genius, the entire plot was how nobody expected him to be Missy (even though the name makes it kinda obvious), he was able to hide in plain sight because noone thought of the possibility he could be a woman. But oh yea let's just make the doctor female to for no good reason.

So yes, you're right being annoyed at this picture is petty. And noone is actually angry about it. Yes, it's a good thing, noone denies that. But seeing something this benign on the frontpage just reminds many people of all the shit pc culture has pulled in the last couple of years.

On the last day of our trip, we went to the train station in Seville, Spain to start our journey back home, only to find out that Interrail had not booked our seats on the train, even if we had booked and paid a week before, so we lost all the trains for the following two days and our airbnb in France. Eventually we flew back home. We spent about 150€ for the plane tickets but realised that re-planning our journey back home would have been significantly more expensive.
The Interrail assistance service was pretty impossible to contact, and, even when we managed to, they would answer two days later... so it was mostly useless.
Despite we had received our interrail passes for free thanks to an initiative of the European parliament, the ""holiday"" cost about 800€ for 11 days.

1068,"&gt; If you believe that you’ll believe anything. Why now at this extremely important time,

Why not now? Due to the timings, there's is time for Parliament to debate any new deal after prorogue. Yes it's convenient that it gives less time for Parliament to block Brexit, which is a good thing considering that's all they've been trying to do for the last week. 

&gt; It was a purge, nobody campaigned on no deal and only a small majority wants it.

Nobody campaigned on no deal because how we left the EU wasn't on the ballot. You could also argue that no-one voted for endless delaying of Brexit either. A purge is necessary if MPs aren't going to respect the wishes of the electorate. 

&gt; There is nothing I see in SO24 that stops a member tabling a bill

Then you've misunderstood how SO24 works. That we're in unprecedented times isn't a good enough reason to break convention multiple times. It's a disgrace that the opposition thinks they can control the government but refuse to call an election. 

&gt; there are good reasons for this that you can read yourself in the statement given by the speaker, do you really think he is deciding these things randomly? The speakers office is full of procedural experts and lawyers that advise him.

The good reason being that he's partisan. 

&gt; Which part of the deal do you not like?

The backstop and the border, the same part that everyone is complaining about. 

Yes, remainers say it's a bad deal because it's not membership, but that's just stupid deflection. It's a bad deal because it locks the UK into the EU via a backstop that is harder to end than membership, and attempts to place an internal border between NI and the rUK. 

&gt; that deal will be accepted one way or the other either before or after we leave.

1081,"Well, the situation seems a bit different looking at it from Ground Zero. For example, you called the Progressives ""right wing nationalists"" - and for completely valid reasons - Vučić was Šešelj and Nikolić's little fascist disciple during the nineties, which is a fact often held against him, among many other things. I'd like to add a bit of perspective to that, though, because an average Serb doesn't see Vučić's policies as particularly nationalist or right wing (in fact his whole schtick seems to be balancing on a tight rope between Russia and the EU, not ready to commit to either one if it means abandoning the other), they see his policies as Vučić's policies, for better or worse. 

&gt; How does anything get done politically?

That's just the thing, it gets done through him. Vučić, whether you wanna paint him left, right or center, is a quasi-dictator, and he has got the country's nuts in a vice. Through control of media and also through being very well-versed in influencing his voter base - old people who love getting a raise in their pensions, yet who forget that Vučić had previously inflicted even larger cuts on them and who live by the mentality ""hey, at least it isn't wartime!"" (very high bar there, grandpa), and tough football-hooligan nationalists who just love when he gives money to their favourite club or tells off the Croatian/Bosniak/Albanian politicians like a boss (ocassional staged international scandals and faux-pas as campaign demagoguery fodder for the politicians in the Balkan countries are a normal occurrence - it's a very inexpensive way to get points with your more nationalist voters).

What I'm trying to say is that, at least from my POV, nobody argues real policy in Serbia. People are not divided into right and left, they are divided into pro and anti Vučić. That's why you see such a strange, eclectic make-up in the parliament and especially ruling coalition (Dačić, an apparent socialist, and his views somehow seem to line up with those of Šešelj's favourite acolyte). It is also a sort of bonus for the Progressives, because you see the same sort of mix on the side of the opposition, where liberals and pseudo-fascists like PSG and Dveri are somehow supposed to coalesce and work together to bring down the ruling party... Even when they make a show of them doing just that, at best it seems disingenuous and it alienates a substantial part of the people meant to support them. And yet, since the game seems to come down purely to numbers, how else are they meant to get a foot in the door?

Just my two cents, you could probably get a thousand different POV's from a thousand mor Serbs.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/d1p5o4/openly_gay_prime_minister_of_luxembourg_with_his/ezsoa1i/,bu-rekt,1568100319

Schools in minority languages got closed, the use of minority languages was restricted, people had their names changed into Hungarian ones etc etc. 

Before that, yes, you could say the Hungarian Kingdom had some decent minority policies, but even then, you could see something fishy. The Transylvanian Diet officially recognised and was composed of 3 ethnic groups: Hungarians, Szeklers and Germans. The Romanians were always a very large ethnic group in Transylvania, yet they never got the chance to be even on the official list of nationalities, with equal rights to the rest. When the Romanians made a petition to the king demanding to be recognised as an official ethnicity in Transylvania, the king simply thew it away. Twice.

I hope that in the near period of time final acceptance by the Buyer will take place, i.e. by the **Polish army, and we will ultimately sign a contract for the supply of about 1,000 units of these vehicles** \- says Witold Słowik, President of the Board of the Polish Armaments Group about the New Floating Infantry Fighting Combat Badger - We have all the rights to this vehicle, which is why it will probably be one of the flagship export products - he adds.

&amp;#x200B;

In an interview with Defence24, president Słowik stated that for PGZ it is very important to have innovative products that represent the global level. Today, such PGZ products include, among others Crab self-propelled howitzer, GROT small arms system, navigation or radar systems.

The group is also focused on research and development, and during this year's MSPO presented the prototype of the New Borsuk Infantry Infantry Fighting Vehicle. The chassis is created as part of research and development work under the direction of Huta Stalowa Wola, financed by the National Center for Research and Development. In turn, the tower is built in cooperation with HSW and the private company WB Electronics. As President Słowik pointed out, the Borsuk prototype has already undergone the first tests ""in the field of buoyancy, anti-mine protection and resistance to destruction"". He added that the vehicle has unique technical parameters.

Witold Słowik also talked about the need for government support for arms exports, both from the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ""These types of contracts, especially large ones, require diplomatic support,"" he noted.

President Słowik also referred to the Promoters of Security report - leading products of the Polish defense industry, prepared by [Defence24.pl](https://Defence24.pl) and describing a list of ten products with high export potential. He noted that the report both appreciates the companies that were included in the ranking and shows potential buyers of selected products that have passed the selection.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/d235xe/poland_will_buy_around_1000_ifvs_infantry/ezsiop5/,Tartyron,1568093078

Erm no. Your source even says one man got injured in the explosion. Why would you lie about that when its literally in your source 

&gt;And one... well someone got beaten up. But since it was an immigrant they called a terrorist attack. Not in Poland. Only leftist media that could not stand the fact that anti-immigration policy worked and they protected their citizen.

Erm, no. One of the ones in 2016 was a bomb that was detonated near a bus injuring one man. It is suspected that it was anti-immigrant terrorists who did this. The other was three people planting bombs under police vehicles. They were neutralised before they detonated. The one in 2017 was a bomb that was detonated at a police station. There were no injuries. 

Out of the three attacks, none involved people being beaten up.

China seems to be trying to export it to Africa, US companies are gonna move where they see fit right now it seems to be SEA.

Worth noting that the UK Government has a huge accumulated national debt and usually runs a deficit too (even if its within the magic 3% debt to GDP ratio) so actually *if* you are subsidising us - *its with borrowed money* and the only thing underpinning this debt is foreign UK Government bond holders who are in the minority - the rest of bond holders are Domestic UK based - so the financial model of the UK is mostly an IOU to itself

If The Scottish Government runs a huge deficit its because the UK overspends on a macro level and Scotland shares an apportionment of that overspend - many EU countries of similar size to Scotland like Ireland for example could simply not afford to share an apportionment of say Germany level expenditure and spending decisions - at the same time you can also argue that the UK Government has squandered Scottish resources like Oil and failed to setup an Oil fund to avoid Scotland falling into deficit - the UK government is almost satisfied that Scotland is in deficit

The SNP has also pointed out that devolution means we do not have full control and *without full control* we do not have *full responsibility* of the deficit - they point out that for devolved matters the books are balanced

As it makes no financial sense its not clear why the UK hangs on to Scotland I believe its because is well within Londons interests to have a UK to rule and in turn to subside and in this regard who subsidises who ?",DNA% 54🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿19🇩🇪11🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿7🇳🇴6🇸🇮3🇫🇷,/r/europe/comments/d1nage/24_of_ryanairs_europe_airport_likely_to_be/ezram77/,Jiao_Dai,1568071046

Parliment doesn't exist because the Queen allows it, the Queen governs because the parliment allows it to. As was the conclusion of the English Civil War, the Restoration and the following Glorious Revolution. The Monarchy was reestablished with incredible chains on their ability to govern without parliments consent. She is nothing more than a figure head and rubber stamp, and that is final.

The army is not some monolithic entity. Not only does the army host an incredibly large number of conservative soldiers who likely support Boris' attempts to mould the Brexit Deal, but the idea that they would try and overthrow a democratically elected Government simply because their branch has the word *Royal* in it and owes its consitution to the monarchy is laughable. The military has had many apt oppurtunities to overthrow parliment through it's 300 years of history, Brexit doesn't even qualify as the top 5.

The USSR is another nice example of a state that was never secular, and as soon as the Communist religion collapsed other religions started to thrive again. Russia and other ex-Soviet states are amongst the most officially religious in Europe these days, with Christianity and Islam having made big comebacks. The same was happening in China until Xi came to power and became a dictator. Now he's cracking down on religions like Christianity, Islam and certain sects of Buddhism hard.

That's something private and (mostly) harmless. As for economic ""philosophies"" it is the same thing.

1521,"  Links for full year are best because there are massive fluctuation in month to month figures. July is the 2nd best time of the year for govenrment finances, so I really dont feel cherry picking those few months is beneficial at all. At the bottom is a link showing this.

Also interest payments on debt are higher now than at any point in the last 20 years as percentage of GDP. Its 3.5% of GDP now which was seen last in 1994/95 and then prior to that in 1989. It is currently higher that at any point in the last twenty years. Economics help have a good article on debt, and thats underneath.

They are not costed in any traditional sense, only a politicans view. There fiscal credibility rule has the most beautiful bullshit statement I have seen. ""And that is why our target for eliminating
the deficit excludes investment."" Funny that debt markets wont see it like that but cool. Plus, I really doubt his ability to pass through and enact legislation that will actually benefit the sections of our company that we really need. 

And I really dont think they will improve the situation long term, maybe just a short term boost. Long term I feel the inefficiencies that are liable when you get underpaid low quality people working in highly skilled industries is always going to happen. And nah, your last point is basically unmeasurable, wages have been stagnant for about 12 years, but within that period they have massivelyh fluctuated and are currently rising. The country is getting better, but Brexit and the media is fucking the mood and fundamentals, along with the pounds sliding making our imports expensive. But I dont feel Corbyns plans will majorly contribute to improving anything.

Ryan Air would drop the price of any unsold seats to one cent plus airport fees (about 20 Euros) the day before a flight was scheduled. So if you had a flexible schedule you could fly around Europe for next to nothing. Not sure if Ryan Air still does this or not, but it was awesome at the time.

1596,"The religious aspects of the Middle East are used to recruit young men to fight, but the motivations tend to come from several decades of interference in their politics. Many Middle Eastern countries were formed because European colonizers drew lines on a map, and the US has a really unfortunate history of propping up dictators in the region. In the US, they didn't target churches; they targeted the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. 

The IRA fought because Catholics were being discriminated against. You can say that the root causes of the discrimination weren't religious, but ""Catholic"" was a label and a tool they could use to unite people (i.e. recruit young men to fight). They weren't fighting for an independent Ireland; they were fighting for an independent Ireland where Catholics would be treated equally. 

It may sound like I'm picking a particularly pedantic nit, but the problem with accepting the ISIS/Al Qaida claim to religious motivation at face value is that we are in danger of mis-identifying Islam as the threat, which means that Muslim victims fleeing sectarian violence are condemned along with their attackers.

1599,"I wouldn't mind black people if they are just black. But if thry anounce themselves as black and expect me to see purpose in that I won't like it.

My general point is, that regardless of sexuality or race there needs to be purpose behind everything.

I see no purpose in a character randomly stating he/she is trans or gay. Cool, lets move on, but why the need to state it multiple times. I am not dumb I get it. If I hate LGBT people screaming I am one in the game that I like won't chNge that.

As for stereotypes, like I said I think it's more damaging to portray them as walking stereotypes than as normal people.

I generally don't particularly care.

I answered to someone else, take a look at Ellie in the Last of Us. 

If it turns out she is lesbian in the part 2 because men hurt her, doesn't that spit in the face of the LGBT and is just forced in for whatever? That's a badly written character.

On prides, there hasn't been any violence recently in Serbia. Generally rarely anyone cares now.Other than some extremists that don't dare pull shit. Us normal people hear you loud and clear, but again, even with lesbian PM nothing changes. There is nothing accomplished through all these years. It's only become political tool.

Also some people take it too far and get naked, take kids and show them stuff they shouldn't.

I mostly agree with you, and you have stated few times you are gay, yet you did it to prove your point, you weren't in my face with ""I am gay you are not, your opinion is automatically invalid"", rather you took time to discuss, rather than being ""you shitty little Eastern European homophobe"", which is something I often see either directed at me or the others for holding slightly different opinion, yet not dismissing real issues or just pretending.

Especially in my case as I generally am judging everyone equally. 

I also don't see anything wrong in different people holding different opinions. I am willing to accept that as a straight person I cannot know how it feels or looks like from your point of view, only from my own, which is why I highly value the time you took to somewhat broaden my horizons without being dismissisive",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/d1p5o4/openly_gay_prime_minister_of_luxembourg_with_his/ezqv9fq/,akutasame94,1568064372

1661,"depending on the hostel you choose you'll have very different experiences. I made sure to always look at reviews before booking ( thank you Hostel World ) and I always chose the most social/party hostels, and yea, I had lots of fun. 

They always have a ""common area"" where people hang out and a lot of them have a bar. It's so easy to meet people and everything is very spontaneous. It's very common for the hostels to have night activities as well, like bar crawls or game nights.

Other than the social aspect, they're so cheap.

You'll share your room with other people but honestly everyone is there for the same reason - traveling, meeting other people and having fun ( because otherwise they wouldn't stay in a hostel, or they'd get a single-bed room ), so it's not a big deal. 

I haven't met any dangerous/sketchy individuals and I've never even used a locker for my stuff, that's just how chill people in hostels are.

1678,"&gt; Mario is childish representation in my opinion. NEver played Zelda.

Both are indeed childish representations, but that only strengthens my point. These are games made for kids and they revolve all around straight relationships. If they revolved around gay relationships we'd hear this ""SHOVING DOWN OUR THROATS"" spiel every time they get mentioned.

&gt; Or GTA, but last time I checked it's a damn crime simulator and you just get hookers.

Not anymore. GTA4 had entire ""dating sidequests"" where you picked up a girl, took her out to some activity, said the right things etc...and if you did well enough you got laid. Talk about shoving heterosexuality down our throats amIright?

The point is I've proven that there are just as many badly written straight characters who have no personality besides their sexuality, yet no one ever complains about them in the same way. People will say they hate them just as much when questioned, but only ever start ranting about it when it's a gay character.

&gt; Here's a question, from some games I have gotten an idea that every gay male will call me ""honey"" and hug me all the time. Is that correct?

Some gay men will do that, some straight men will do that also. ""Honey"" is a term of endearment that some people use as much as ""dude"" or something, and some people are just huggers.

&gt; Am I to be ok with such characterS?

I mean, why wouldn't you be? Unless you're a bit uncomfortable with touch which I totally get. I don't really like huggers that much because I have some personal space issues.

1780,"&gt;There have been exactly zero people arrested under this law, and of these zero people none of them are Holocaust survivors. It's been made crystal clear that this is merely a slander law, but of course western media likes to portray anything it doesn't like in as negative of a light as possible.

Zero people were arrested because the [Polish government backtracked](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44627129) after international outcry over the law.

&gt;Poland's Law and Justice government, while acknowledging that individual Poles took part in crimes against their Jewish neighbours, argued the legislation was correct because the Polish state had ceased to exist under Nazi and Soviet occupation.  
&gt;  
&gt;The government was surprised, however, by the widespread outrage the law caused, especially from two key Polish allies, Israel and the US, which saw it as an attempt to deny historical truth and muzzle testimony and research into the period.  
&gt;  
&gt;The law also provoked a brief explosion of anti-Semitic feeling on social media and elsewhere in Poland.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The point still stands. Who is supposed to inherit heirless property? 

There are people still alive whose property was stolen. Why do you consider that property heirless?

&gt; Yeah, I'ma need some saucy citations for that. Germany and Poland have, ages ago, agreed on a set of mechanisms that would allow people affected by the Holocaust to petition for compensation and receive it. 

The 1968 purge was not the Holocaust, so those mechanisms don't apply. 

I'm guessing you won't accept citations from Jews, but [here's one](https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/48-years-since-expulsion-of-Polands-Jews-449256):

&gt; The Polish Republic, however, still stands out for its failure and lack of political will to fulfill and recognize its responsibility to the victims. Despite the 48th anniversary of the March events, no viable solution has been found to resolve the critical issue of compensation for the dispossessed, nor have any of its perpetrators been prosecuted.  
Warsaw must revise this approach by passing comprehensive legislation providing for the complete compensation and restitution of assets stolen by the communist governments. The advanced age of the victims makes the matter all the more urgent and the need to act all the more pressing. 

It sounds like the Polish government is trying to adopt your strategy - wait until everyone dies, then claim the property was 'heirless'.",,/r/europe/comments/d1qayx/israelis_brutally_beaten_in_poland_club_attackers/ezpvb8w/,draypresct,1568049385

No it doesn't.

""Ustawę znowelizowano wielokrotnie. Duże, także międzynarodowe, kontrowersje wywołała zainicjowana przez partię Prawo i Sprawiedliwość nowelizacja ustawy dokonana ustawą z dnia 26 stycznia 2018 r. o zmianie ustawy o Instytucie Pamięci Narodowej – Komisji Ścigania Zbrodni przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu, ustawy o grobach i cmentarzach wojennych, ustawy o muzeach oraz ustawy o odpowiedzialności podmiotów zbiorowych za czyny zabronione pod groźbą kary (Dz.U. z 2018 r. poz. 369). **Wprowadziła ona karę pozbawienia wolności za przypisywanie narodowi lub państwu polskiemu odpowiedzialności za zbrodnie popełnione przez nazistowskie Niemcy.**""

As you can see, it's abundantly clear that the amendment serves to criminalise any attribution of participation in the Holocaust onto the *Polish nation, state, or government-in-exile*. It's perfectly legal to make academic writings on anti-semitism perpetrated by Polish citizens, because that's literally not what the amendment is criminalizing.

&gt;Before feminism we used to have suicide hotlines for everyone, now it's just for women.

1918,"&gt; my point was that hong-kong became a brittish colony after britain violently ceased the territory, now you claim it is wrong to do that? ok, lets make a wrong right and return it to it's rightfull owner before it was violently ceased, namely, china.

It is wrong when it goes against the will of the people, no? Strangely enough the UK only negotiated with Illegitimate China over HK because the Chinese junta literally couldn't give a fuck about what the people of HK wanted. 

Irredentism at any cost regardless of human lives though, right? You a fan of the Sudetenland crisis too?

&gt;and those migrant problems we have in europe now, most come from nations where england used to be the overlord and where they fucked things up by attempting to ""spread democracy"" with their US allies, most of europe did not participate in those fuckups,

Lol. The French, Germans, Portugese, Spanish etc had colonies there too.

While we're at it, the reason why all those places are fucked is because of the decolonisation policies pursued by the US and the UN. Had the colonial powers been able to maintain overlordship and been able to build vital infrastructure, education facilities, provide wealth and instill democratic values in those regions then they would've been fully stable, westernised nations. 

&gt;most of those migrants came from former uk colonies who did get ceased by local powers, now you claim that such people have no right to live in the UK? well, when hong-kong is returned to china, those people fall under the same category,

In no way comparable. The people of those former British colonies broke free as soon as possible on their own accord, they made it abundantly clear that they did not want Britain lording over them, many wanted nothing to do with Britain at all. To those nations Britain owes as much as Greece does to Fiji. 

On the other hand, Hong Kong wanted to remain under British rule as opposed to the violent junta occupying China. It's why Hong Kong was the last British colony, because the people wanted British administration. If they didn't want it, they could've booted out the British as soon as Clement Atlee declared the dissolution of the Empire back in the 40s. Instead, they stayed for as long as they could.

That's why HKers are more deserving of a British citizenship. The people *wanted* to remain under British rule but were instead forced to accept the lordship of the Chinese junta. It's very different to people who made a *conscious choice* to leave the Empire, who despised it and wanted independence asap.

&gt;and if the UK really wanted them to be citzens of the UK, they could have given them UK citzenship status, wich they did not do, partially because the people of hong-kong did not want that

And partially because the British hoped the Chinese junta would respect the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong. The handover was also quite tense and blanket granting everyone a British citizenship would've fiercely ignited tensions with the junta, and the people of HK would probably face a reprisal for it.

Now in 2019 the city is doomed anyway, it's only a matter of time before it's beaten into submission. If there was ever a time to help HK, it would be now.

&gt;the jungle in calais is created because those people (former colony citzens) want to go to the UK, but the UK asked europe not to let them cross, we obliged, are you saying we should ""fix the problem"" by letting them pass? it's only a word, we'll gladly stop fixing your problem, it would be good for us!

Who let them into the EU in the first place? You know what an external border is? What its function is? The responsibility for Maghrebi and Sub-Saharan migrants falls squarely on Germany for letting them all in. Again, a good portion of those migrants are also from Francophone nations, why should the UK take in random migrants from the mess the French created?

I don't really expect the EU to fix the problem either. It had plenty of time to properly organise a response, to build refugee camps, to repatriate them or assimilate them into European nations, but it ended up doing fuckall. Don't pretend that the little mess the old guard of the EU caused is any way a responsibility of Britain.",Free Hong Kong,/r/europe/comments/d1oatu/boris_johnson_fight_for_us_hong_kong_citizens/ezp6ph4/,OrchideanFreud,1568034234

And saying that no group goes against their own interest was a bit hyperbolic but let's be realistic. Say we ever get to crossroads and the issue of some female privilege comes up, say how women are more likely to get child custody. Realistically do you think majority of feminists would stand with men on that? Would they be willing to 1. realize their privilege and 2. tear it down? One of the most popular sayings in feminism is how equality feels like oppression to a privileged group. I feel like we'd see that in action if we ever tried to fix child custody laws.

PEOPLE DO CARE.

I'd just like to point out that, while every suicide is too much, numbers in Europe (and globally I understand) are steadily decreasing. So to say that ""no one cares"" or ""nothing is done"" would be very wrong. Mental health work is not what it was a couple of decades ago and you shouldn't be afraid to talk to a professional. They can help. I speak from experience.

There is a lot of help and support to be had. Never isolate yourself with suicidal toughts. One can start just by googling suicide hotline or suicide prevention in your own language and reach out.

These feelings don't make you weak or mean there is anything wrong with you. You just have mental health condition and there is a lot that can be done to help you with that.

And you know, I used to down play my own symptoms in my head and tell myself that I am not sick enought to ask for help. Mental health work is not only for those with very acute problems and yealds better results when you seek help in early stages. If you feel you could use help,you should go ask for it. The scariest part in my own journey was that in retrospective I can see I had no idea how bad my stituation was.",,/r/europe/comments/d1n3a5/deaths_due_to_intentional_selfharm_in_the_eu/ezoryh5/,theswamphag,1568027336

Turks have been referring to the city as Istanbul since as long as they have been there. And Istanbul itself is Greek “eis tin Poli” (to the city) bastardized into Turkish through what the Turks would hear from Greeks. Konstantiniyye was also used administratively by Turks which also is bastardized Constantinople. Greeks mostly referred to it as Constantinople.

So in 1920s, when letters and telegraphs peaked, these names caused a huge confusion back when there was no Excel. Turkey was already referring to it as Istanbul but in late 20s Turkey sent a notification to all foreign embassies that from now on the city name will be standardized for official and delivery purposes and only the name Istanbul will be used.

&gt;Having said that, while there are many legitimate criticisms of Israeli policy, in my experience (online) the Venn Diagram of ""Israel is an evil apartheid invasion"" and ""Anti-Semite"" looks a lot like a circle. It gets very old, very fast. 

It might get old but that Venn diagram is far from a circle. 

The majority of Irish people would agree with that statement. I'd say a lot of former colonies would. Israel does have a lot of elements that resemble apartheid. Any defence of their actions in Gaza or the West Bank is a defence of Colonialism. You may not like that truth but it is the truth. 

Criticism of the policy and actions of the Israeli state is not antisemitic, despite what Netanyahu and his ilk would have us believe. 

What's tiring is people's cavalier attitude to the systemic brutal murder and pillaging of various people across the world. Whether that be First Nations people in the America's from the Amazon Basin to the northern most reaches of Canada, the Yemenis, the Palestinians, Aboriginal peoples, and the multitudes of tribes across Polynesia, the Uyghurs or Rohingya or Afghans.

All these cases are different in detail but similar in affect.

2422,"Well, mostly to see how Google translate handles Finnish, here's the Finnish PM Antti Rinne on Boris Johnsson extending the parliamentary hiatus:

&gt;Finnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne (sd) condemns British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for neglecting democracy in smelling the Brexit.

&gt;\- I very much wonder about the way in which the Prime Minister, through the work of Parliament, is trying to forget democracy in this situation. If we had such a situation at all, then the cry would be huge, Rinne said in Parliament.

&gt;Johnsson decided last week to suspend the parliament for a longer period than usual. Parliament therefore had very little time to come up with new Brexit solutions.

&gt;According to the slope, the Brexit process within the UK has become even more confused.

&gt;The British Parliament seeks to prevent unrequited brexit by legislation and force Johnson to seek EU postponement of brexit. Johnson would rather lead Britain to a new election.

&gt;Currently, Britain is due to resign from the EU on 31 October, with or without an agreement.
""There is no desire for extra time""

&gt;According to the slope, the general atmosphere in Europe is that no extra time will be given even if Britain decides to request it.

&gt;\- If there is no certainty about a change coming through extra time, there is no willingness to give that extra time. At the moment, I cannot say whether the situation in Britain is changing in the way that one might expect any such new perspective on this brexit entity.

&gt;However, he leaves the back door open for extra time.

&gt;\- It's about having to have some perspective for the situation to change for a smarter, better direction.

&gt;The slope was to be met by Prime Minister Boris Johnson as Prime Minister of the EU Presidency shortly. However, Johsson soon announced that he would postpone the meeting due to his urgency and there is no new information on the fate of the meeting on the Slope.

&gt;Rinne states that the confusion of the Brexit situation in the UK so far does not give Finland opportunities, for example, to act as a mediator to resolve the situation.",Gifu,/r/europe/comments/d18dod/views_articles_on_brexit_from_the_remaining_eu/ezn055j/,Rotanloukku,1567999162

That's not really the subject here, but rather the issue with a number of Labour members both in and out of government being nakedly antisemitic and the party dragging their feet on dealing with it. Ken Livingston being a prime example, but by no means the only one. 

Having said that, while there are many legitimate criticisms of Israeli policy, in my experience (online) the Venn Diagram of ""Israel is an evil apartheid invasion"" and ""Anti-Semite"" looks a lot like a circle. It gets very old, very fast.

The banks cannot invest all their money in the places they want, since they are heavily regulated. Since, they have some extra money from the people's savings they have to invest it somewhere or otherwise declare it as ""failure to make money from money in their reserves"" which counts as a loss.  And in this case, their losses on a negative bond yields are less than other options.
The government knows this and takes advantage of it to make some money of them.

&gt;Or maybe he just believes Turkey is not a part of Europe.

Yes he does, but not for the reasons you think.


&gt;Which is fine, I mean you can believe earth is flat for all I care.

You believing in something that does or doesn't exist is your problem. You disrespecting something I value, however, is OUR problem. 

&gt;I don't even know who defines the borders of Europe but apparently 5% of Turkey is in Europe, geographically. 

Being a part of Europe and being a European country are two different things IMV. The former considers the geography, the latter considers politics, religion, economy, society... everything. 

&gt;But correct me if I'm wrong, you think Europe is somehow superior to Turkey?

Europe is not a country, so the comparison is wrong. But let me put it this way: I prefer a European Turkey over the Middle Eastern one. 

&gt;Just because we put some effort into joining EU in the past, does it really mean we're trying to ""accomplish"" the goal of joining almighty EU since 50 years?

""Some"" effort? Dude. 

&gt;That ship is sailed a decade ago.We tried here and there and it didn't work out.

Not a decade ago. Turkey'd been pushing hard for EU membership until a few years ago. If the government was given a chance to get the Turkey into the EU, they'd take it right away. 

&gt;Turns out EU is not as secular as it looks because as you said they don't want a Muslim majority country in EU, that's the opposite of being secular.

The majority being Muslim is not the only problem. It's how much people let the religion dictate their lives. In Turkey, the religion took the form of a government, and it's used to control and manipulate. I don't blame the EU for this.

&gt; I think we're better off this way anyway.2 countries that's not in EU are the richest gdp per capita countries in EU, that tells something.

I don't even mind about the darkness because the snow makes the world to look brighter than it is. However, this period is here a bit too long from mid december to end of february or early march so it gets a bit boring but it is better what was prior to that...

I mean the slushy period, which sucks. That's from late october to early december. It starts snowing but it also occasionally rains and the temperatures hover around 0°C. People break their bones and the stupidest ones who didn't change to winter tires early enough break others' bones too. It's very dark too because there's no snow yet.

Before the slushy period we have our autumn which is the same as your winter except that the autumn colors can be super beautiful and it's not constantly raining, some days are actually very pleasant. That'll happen pretty soon here but it's delayed due to warm weather.

After the ""winter proper"" in march and early april we have the ""winter fun"" period, which means there's a lot of snow, there starts to be a lot of light, and it rains only occasionally. Temperatures during the daytime are around 0. This is the winter sports period so people ski a lot among other things.

Then in april and early may we have our spring, which also is equal to your winter, except that it's dry apart from the ground because the snow is melting. This period lasts until early may. It's nice because there's a lot of light but nights are cold so you can again break your hip in the morning. At this poing everyone is just waiting for the summer.

I just wrote all this and made comparison to Croatia because everyone in ex-Yu is always like ""Ohh, what could've been..."", so we in Serbia always like to ask ourselves ""Ohh, what could've been if our players played for country as well as they play for their clubs, ohh what could've been if FSS wasn't a mafia, ohh what could've been if our managers weren't idiots that usually couldn't get job in San Marino, but somehow got job with us, etc."" And really, with talented players we had over the years and that we still have, who knows.

2647,"1. As your GDP grows your wages grow too. When wages grow a nation becomes less competitive. Others will be able to make the same stuff cheaper - the same you did earlier - so you'll start losing markets and eventually also jobs. Then you have to start investing more in R&amp;D and education or it's a game over. This is very costly. You will also start buying more stuff from other countries and moving your manufacturing there too which means the companies inside your borders experience another blow. They're now facing competition against foreign operators which have smelled some markets.

To be competitive at this stage the country needs to have implemented the virtues EU is all about, which some countries seem to have hard time understanding: proper democracy, free press, low corruption, efficient bureaucracy, good education, well functioning justice system, equality, healthy labor, personal rights and freedoms, clean environment, etc. When you're on top these, and other things, are needed to enable people to be able to generate that GDP growth, unless you live in some oil state. If these basic things are functioning they will drag you down. All this costs money.

2. When your country becomes richer it will attract more immigrants. Your country now also starts to want them. That's because you need experts from other countries to help improving your R&amp;D. You don't want to spend your money for re-inventing the wheel, you know, so it's just cheaper that way. The rules generated to bring in those experts in will allow others to come too. And it's those experts who might want to have friends from their home countries and to eat in restaurants that serve the food they're accustomed to so you kinda might want to let them in.

Maybe some types of cheap wine would be cheaper because they'd be able to mass import large quantities and thus get a better price, but that's also it. A pint in a pub wouldn't be cheaper, nor would the beer in the store.

What Vinmonopolet does give you is a store that sells alcohol where the staff knows their shit. They're trained to give good service and help you what you want to find.

2861,"&gt;600 years ago that caused the Polish Golden era. 

Also was an indirect cause of subsequent collapse of Poland, 100 years of partitions, millions of Poles being scattered all over random Bummfucks, Nowhere in Eastern Europe, and ultimately meeting a terrible end during WW2.

&gt;Haha. Are Poles ever happy about anything?

No. From now we'll only need about 100 years of continuous economic growth to even begin to smile.

&gt;All that shows is that Poland annexed Vilnius illegally by way of a backstab. Thanks for proving my point.

It also shows that the city:

(a) was called Wilno both officially and by its in habitants

(b) was controlled by Poland

QED

&gt;Except that Lithuanians didn't go extinct as the Romans did. 

All Romance-speaking nations are descendants of Romans.

&gt;Nice shitty example. ""Strasbourg 'Straßburg'"" that's literally the same name.

No shit Sherlock! Just like Wilno/Vilnius are the same name, just in different languages. And depending on which nationality predominantly inhabited a given city, the relevant name should be used.

That's why I'm talking about Wilno before the ethnic cleansing of Poles, and Vilnius - when talking about empty husk of the city that is located there ever since then.

&gt;Cherry picking :) 

Nah, the 1897 census shows 20% of Russians. Most Russians left after 1914. Maths checks out.

&gt;Source? Please provide documentation.

Every single census done in 20th century, before the Lithuanian takeover of the city in 1939. There was one German census, and two Polish ones, and all three show Polish comfortanly over 50%, i.e. a majority, while Lithuanian in low single digits (1-2%).

All three censuses are easily available on the Internet, one google search away.

There you have, documentation. That's already way more sources than you have provided entire day for your absurdal bullshit!

&gt;Please provide documentation. Also if the city was called slightly differently for 10 years means jack shit. It

Oh, we have a progress. Then it was ""it never happened"", now you admit that it was ""maybe 10 years"". Soon enough the truth will dawn on you - that hardly anyone living in the city between the early Commonwealth era, and 1940 ever referred to it as ""Vilnius"". Wilno or Vilna were names you would heard from the locals much more often.

&gt;don't shove ""Krokuva"" or ""Varšuva"" down your throat. 

Probably because thst's not how inhabitants of those cities ever called them.

&gt;then you protective vomit at us with your shitty language

Subjective matter. I, for one, consider our language beautiful, and yours - sounding exactly like Russian, just with non-Slavic made-up gibberish words.

&gt;Repeatedly calling it Wilno when talking on the internet in English is asshole behaviour

Again, I'm only using the name 'Wilno' when refering to periods when it was called Wilno. I also don't call Constantinople 'Istanbul', when talking about the context of Justinian I.

&gt;Poland illegally annexed a city that belonged to a foreign sovereign country.

After it was illegally annexed from us by Soviet Russia 3 months earlier. Why would we care that they gifted the city to Lithuania in exchange for military access? We lost the city to Soviets, we retook it from Lithuania. So it goes.

&gt;The annexation was probably the biggest backstab in human history between historical allies

Our ""historical allies"" was Grand Duchy of Lithuania, an entity which ceased to exist a century prior to that. Not a group of Baltic-speaking LARP-ers who excluded all the other Grand Duchy inhabitants from their nation.

&gt;It's extraordinary that you keep trying to find excuses for it. 

Excuses? It was a 100% correct choice on Poland's side. If I could turn back time and influence Poland's decision, I would do it again. Why would we let a Baltic-speaking nationalist country, driven by obsession to eradicate everything non-Baltic-language, to take over a Polish-speaking city? It would be like letting the people on a drowning ship die. That simply couldn't do.

&gt;Should one not be upset when betrayed by your closest ally?

The last time Poland and Lithuania were allies, was during the 1863 uprising. Then a Baltic-speaking part of Lithuanians decided they are the only real ones, and started to endanger all the other inhabitants of former Grand Duchy. We stopped being allies the moment that happened, everything that occured since then was just a consequence of such decision by this small subset of former GDL inhabitants.","Warsaw, Poland",/r/europe/comments/d11649/who_needs_security_in_the_east_german_postcard/ezkl0z9/,nieuchwytnyuchwyt,1567962097

2917,"&gt;Turkish culture is not European, but you are making a ""particular"" case for it because they ravished the Balkans big time and infused the worst in humans into their culture, thus liking Balkans and Turkey. Maybe you should also make a ""particular"" case for Morocco, because Iberia is also infused with lots of Moorish habits

Turkey is in a middle-zone.

About Andalusia,the architecture definitely have a lot of Arabic influences,but about the other parts of the culture, Andalusia isn't influenced like tha Balkans from Turkey,for example in Sicily a lot of architectural monuments have a mix between arabic and Scandinavian design,but despise that the culture of Sicily in the other cultural fields isn't very influenced by arabic people,only a bit.

&gt;Do attempts to remove any sane and sound Western custom from them count, like they did with Albania 

Albania is definitely European,and Turkish culture influenced all the countries that Ottomans dominated (with all I mean also the Christian majority countries),and despise that those countries are totally European.

&gt;So according to you, as long as I cleanse the dago within me and learn all the ways of the Japanese,

Try to think to a child that live in Japan since he was 5, or was born in Japan,his friends are only Japanese guys,with his family he speaks only in Japanese and he don't know the languages of his parents,or he remembers only few things (in the case he was 5 or 6 when he comes here),he doesn't believe in any kind of religion ecc ecc, definitely isn't European.

&gt;Aha, the immigrant has the right to define himself as he wants

I said 2nd and 3rd generations,a lot of them that borned here(Italy), usually they speak only English and the language of the country where they live,who speak the other language admits that Italian is their mother language, generally who is from a Christian family tends to be atheist,who is from a muslim family follows some rules only because they don't want to annoy their parents,but when they go and live alone they do what they want  indipendently from their religion of origin (the majority in Italy).",,/r/europe/comments/d0zzfw/view_of_baiterek_on_the_nurzhol_boulevard/ezkmuzw/,kevinkgj,1567963036

Don't be so sure. Even knowing how high would be the tariffs or how will the other countries react to brexit or brexit extension is important. 

&gt; A no deal would crumble the UK's economy 

It would cause a recession in UK, but i doubt would last for more than 1 or 2 years. 

&gt; the kingdom wouldn't be so united afterwards. 

I think no one know what will happen.

&gt;  The financial crises of 2008 started with a single bank and no one saw what would happen so I'm not as confident on this...

It was one of the biggest banks and it failed because of systematic problem, the subprime mortgage.

I today's world central banks can help and many EU countries have surplus in their budget so they can go into deficit to help the economy. 

If recession hits Germany, they can easily run 2 or 3% deficit for 2 or 3 years to boost their economy.

The best option is UK stays, the second best option is UK leaves with EU deal. But UK parliament doesn't want to stay and doesn't accept the EU deals, so wait further is pointless just leave once and for all.

(...)

According to his brother Barak’s Facebook post, one of the assailants punched Yotam in the face and he lost consciousness. Barak speculated that the assailant used a knuckle-duster given the serious injuries Yotam sustained and the fact that he was knocked unconscious.

2991,"&gt; yes, but purchasing power alone is insufficient to explain which country is better or worse economically.

which - again - nobody but you ever tried to argue about

&gt;These assertions are however in part wrong. In the WKÖ statistic I cited Austria had a price index of 127 while Germany had an index of 123, so a difference of 4pp or prices are on average 3,15% lower in Germany than Austria. However wages are higher in Austria and I showed this with PPP GDP/capita. Economic output cannot be ignored because Economic Output/Production is equal to an economy's income +/- transfers.

Again, the statistic you're referencing is taking GDP into account which is irrelevant. At this point you're making it ridiculous. GDP is equal to an economy's income is one way of calculating it, yes, but it's still highly irrelevant since there's so much more to an overall economy's income than simply net wages. If anything, the only thing that *would theoretically* come close to the topic that's originally been discussed would be national income which is a drastic difference from GDP.

2998,"*Ireland and Scotland demand reparations*

All the Icelandic chronicles themselves indicate that Irish monks or Papar were present on the Iceland and other islands before the Norse arrived

Also not only might have Irish monk St Brendan possibly discovered Vinland (America) first before Leif Erikson or Christopher Columbus but even if the Leif Erikson claim is true Scottish slaves Haki and Hekja may have been the first Europeans to step on Vinland before even Leif Erikson as Vikings often used Gaelic slave scouts/runners

By the same token between 10-20% Male lineage in Iceland and Faroe is Celt too probably R1b L21

In this regard the male and female lineage is over 50% Celt in total however putting this in perspective your Y or MtDNA is not always an accurate indicator of your Autosomal DNA your Y/mtDNA marker could indicate *all or a large chunk* of your autosomal ethnicity or it could be *as little as just 1/1000th* so without a complete DNA study of all people in Faroe its just an estimate

One aspect that always fascinated me was Ástandið - during Allied occupation of Iceland Icelandic women were seemingly enamoured with the occupying forces of British and Americans which resulted in many marriages - many of these soldiers which would have Celtic lineage as Irish (Irish fighting in British Army or Irish Americans) Scots and English too have Celtic lines (Gaels in Ireland, Gales and Brittonic Celts in Scotland and mainly Brittonic Celt in England)

The risk of what ?

&gt;Please go on an explain what the redundancy costs are and why they are so big.

If you have a lot of entities that manage research but they do so without coordination, they might all end up researching the same thing individually.

If you know how research goes, you should realize that means they'll waste a ton of money and might not have enough funds individually to accomplish some things, whereas together they could pool all the money and spend it once per item.

Let's take the large hadron collider. It cost I don't know how many billions. If instead of it being funded by all of Europe, you had each country build its own, you'd end up with 28 (or more) LHCs, probably each of them smaller and less powerful and thus unable to do some of the things our current LHC can do.

Do you understand now ? Do you see how building a single LHC is more efficient than building 28+ slightly smaller ones ?",,/r/europe/comments/d0u463/the_eu_plans_to_spend_100_billion_on_research_and/ezk67ho/,deponent,1567955554

Erdogan, whoever he is, is my country's elected president. Just because my countrymen are bunch of uneducated backward morons do not change the fact that in a country like Turkey if we insist to follow the only right path which is Democracy, we have to respect the figure what Erdogan presents.

This is aside, Erdogan is just pure evil. Misusing your power is evil. He is using the power he got from the election in a really really evil way on people like me and I am the one who will stand against this. However we have no other solution. Democracy is our only way to get out of the things and it works or it doesn't work no matter what, democracy is the only way.

So we come to a point. If we ""HAVE TO"" defend one person out of two, I, as a person who hate Erdogan with all my heard, will always defend Erdogan over a cunt cult leader, because this way or other way Erdogan is chosen by my countrymen. He is the cancer of Democracy, but at least it is a product of Democracy. Not a coup or intervention (yet... Well when it comes to Erdogan you can never be sure he won't do a coup of hisself once he lose the power:/)

3166,"Well, if people here wanted to look a bit further rather than just satisfy their regular blind French bashing, we could have a real discussion about it. 

You’re all conveniently ignoring why the situation ended up like this, just so you can insult people. 

Originally the parliament was agreed to be in Strasbourg. Not traveling around. So they started to build a nice building for it. 

Since they wanted it to look nice and symbolic, it took a while, and they needed a temporary place to seat. Belgium, who was trying to get the maximum of local advantage from this EU thing, what not happy that the parliament wasn’t going to be there. So they saw their opportunity to fuck over the decision.

They quickly put together an acceptable space, not nice on a shitty building, but good enough for being temporary. And proposed it, to try to get the MPs installed in the city and the Strasbourg parliament  considered like the odd location. And it worked. 

Now, things have changed, everybody sees it would make sense to let it be and finally officially reward the Belgian backstabbing and selfish endangering of the treaties. 

The issue is that it would fuck over Alsace. And no French president so far can afford to locally piss off an entire region over an issue where he’s right but most other people won’t change their vote over. I mean, that’s why France lets Alsace also get away with ignoring the constitution and have a state-supposed religion. 

So the only realistic solution is to propose something that won’t piss off Alsace. And so far the EU and MEPs have been unable to do that, because like most commenters they get more from endulging on some French bashing rather than actually think.",,/r/europe/comments/d1705v/today_i_realized_the_strasburg_european/ezj8p1l/,unsortinjustemebrime,1567940600

3285,"&gt; Right so participating in the biggest battle in medieval europe just gets a footnote from you but beating a dead horse for 13 years is where it counts apparently.

Yes, while battle was big and a victory, it lacked any political conclusion. Jagiełło (Jogaila) couldn't wasn't able to siege down Marienburg and had to retreat and subsequently result of Battle of Grunwald was pretty underwhelming, Knights might was undermined, but it wasn't really broken.

&gt; Dragged? There was no dragging involved. If Poland didn't want to get dragged into it Poland could have no agreed to the union. See where I'm getting at? We both know that if the union had not taken place the history of both our countries would have looked a lot different.

Obviously I don't mean that Poland was involuntary dragged into it and the Polish nobles had no say in it, but the subsequent centuries of warfare with Muscovy and later Russia were direct result of Lithuanian - Muscovy rivalry over Rus that was inherited by Poland. Before the Union, Muscovy wasn't really rival of Poland.

&gt; Poland would have gotten into a civil war real quick without an heir and eaten up by the Teutons


That's a very big jump in logic to assume Poland would descent into civil war if it didn't choose Jogaila as the husband for Jadwiga. There were other candidates Poland could have chosen - for example Habsburg which would certainly turned Polish attention more westwards. Anyway, it was actually Lithuania that suffered a couple [civil wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Civil_War) after Union of Krewo and it's Polish forces that helped Jogaila prevent fragmentation of Grand Duchy into smaller principalities.",,/r/europe/comments/d11649/who_needs_security_in_the_east_german_postcard/eziulr9/,fidel_castrato,1567933582

3357,"Your entire article discusses how we've been hasty in predicting the end of fossil fuels several times before, and the estimated years that it does mention are for *known* reserves.

The problem with this is, that it's not equality viable to search and drill for oil everywhere. Saudi Arabia is always viable, since you just touch the sand and you find oil near the surface. The Russian tundra or Norwegian ocean reserves are much more expensive to drill in. As a result, of oil prices drop enough, they'll stop producing oil, but Saudi Arabia won't, because too them it's still profitable.

Where am I going with this? There's plenty of places we don't think to drill or look for oil because it wouldn't be profitable, but if we ever started running out of oil, the prices would rise and make it profitable. Eventually once we have experience with drilling in such regions, we'll be more efficient and prices will drop again, while keeping the new production.

If we really start running out, then if the price of oil per barrel rises high enough, we can start synthesizing it, which we are entirely capable of doing, our methods are just expensive. We'd start making it out of coal, of which we have more than other fossil fuels, and of which there are undoubtedly other reserves we can mine around the globe.

3409,"**Up to several thousand right-wing extremists from all over the world are taking part in the war in eastern Ukraine. Many of them, after returning home, may pose a serious terrorist threat - writes Marcin Łuniewski in ""Rzeczpospolita"".**

The right-wing extremists who fight in Ukraine come from Germany, the United Kingdom, Croatia, the Netherlands, the United States and even Australia - writes ""Rz"". They are mostly white men with military training and legal problems. Luniewski describes the story of the Swede Mikael Skillta, who confessed to being a neo-Nazi, or the Italian Francesco, who belonged to the neo-fascist National Vanguard - in the 1970s the organization prepared attacks on left-wing politicians.

According to various sources, around 2,500 right-wing radicals from all over the world are now fighting in Donbass. ""On the basis of talks with volunteers, there are several reasons why they came to Ukraine. Some through the media, the internet and propaganda saw this conflict as a reflection of an ideological war that was close to their hearts. Those who fight for separatists defend Russia as the guardian of traditional values against Western liberalism. Volunteers on the Ukrainian side, in contrast, defend white Europe against Asian invaders"" - enumerates in an interview with Plus Minus Dr. Adrien Nonjon, a historian from the Paris National Institute for Oriental Languages and Civilizations, who has been studying extreme right-wing groups for several years - describes ""Rz"".

Right-wing radicals also admit that they decided to participate in the Donbass conflict after being contacted by members of ultra-nationalist Ukrainian organisations.

Western governments have recognised the problem and are already trying to find the means to solve it. One of the proposals is the reintegration of extremists into society. BBC journalists report that there are several NGOs working in extreme right-wing circles. An example is Exit Norway, which focuses on understanding the reasons why people join neo-Nazi groups. The organisation also tries to show them another way; in a similar way it is done with Islamists - says ""Rz"".

Exit Norway volunteers stress that they work with people who are ready to leave the radicals and change their lives. ""Once the candidate's motivation has been checked, a ""course"" starts, often with former members of extreme organisations who have broken with a violent past. - describes ""Rz"".",Poland,/r/europe/comments/d17wen/rightwing_extremists_from_all_over_the_world_are/ezihlq9/,Duchowicz,1567927235

3468,"&gt; Not incredulous if you realised that sovereignty in Britain lies in the parliament, not the people.

Because it's the UK and went through an iterative shift from monarchy to *de facto* republic and remains a *de jure* monarchy, the technical term for the seat of sovereignty is the [Queen-in-Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen-in-Parliament), though in practice, yeah, it's the parliament:

&gt;The specific language of ""the Crown"", ""the King"", or ""the Queen"" in parliament used in the Commonwealth realms also alludes to the constitutional theory that ultimate authority or sovereignty rests with the monarch, but is delegated to elected and/or appointed officials.

https://www.jstor.org/stable/1321473?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents

&gt;Sovereignty in English Law
&gt;
&gt; According to modern law and practice there is no doubt that Parliament, or to speak more technically, the Queen in Parliament, is sovereign in England, and no other person or body has the attributes of sovereignty.  ""The one fundamental dogma of English constitutional law is the absolute legislative sovereignty or despotism of the King in Parliament.""

Two of his sons – Charles the Bald and Louis the German – swore allegiance to each other against their brother – Lothair I – in the Oaths of Strasbourg, and the empire was divided among Louis's three sons (Treaty of Verdun, 843).

**""Muslim Convert Beheads Woman In Garden"".** The focus is on ""muslim"" (aka islam is at fault) and that we are talking about a mentally deranged person

**""We Must be Rental"".** I have no doubt that this happened as you say, however mistakes in the system always happen. Is this systematic? No, thus this mistake is inconsequential (of course it should be corrected, but the fact that is front page serves a purpose).

**""Fury Over Britains 2 Million Illegal Immigrants""**
&gt; The ONS has it at over 800,000, but even they admit they don't know, its using a model from different countries so they could be way out...and this was a few years ago...so is that number wrong? who knows.

So where does this number comes from? Is it accurate? Should it be at the front page? Why not 10 Million illegal immigrants? 

**""True Toll Of Mass Migration On UK Life"".** You say that this is from Home office, but I could not find it. Can you point me in the right direction if possible? Unfortunately I cannot see that info in the image. 

**""208,000 Passports Handed To Migrants In One Year""**. Again the emphasis is ""In One year"". Did those people got their passports illegally? It wasn't within their rights? The emphasis ""in One year"" makes it as some ominous event.

**""Migrants Handed £5bn Tax Credits""**. Again I cannot find the MAC source, as well as the phrasing (handed 5bn tax credits) seems vague.

**""There Are Too Many Migrants...John Major tells Brussells unless borders are tightened there's a 50% chance Britain will quit the EU""**

UK was already enjoying benefits that other members did not. However, this implies that the main reason UK voted to leave is immigration. Your leaders said that current EU people in UK can stay, they are welcomed, and we hear the phrase ""friends and partners"" every second word. Thus the problem of ""too many migrants"" is not being solved, unless EU citizens decide to leave en masse UK.

Lithuania was in a losing struggle with Muscovy, without union with Poland it would have enjoyed an additional 200 years of Russian rule.

Indeed the Napoleonic infantry column was a tactic built almost entirely around getting conscripts to smash through an enemy line while giving them little chance to run away, since the men behind would push those ahead forwards and officers could easily keep them in check from the sides.

This ran into huge trouble when faced with the British Army's more disciplined troops who, crucially, regularly trained with live ammunition and as such were able to mow down the columns before they could smash through the line or deploy into line to return fire, often leading to absurd disparities in casualties.

3893,"Boris Johnson is to be congratulated for sacking the 21 Tory MPs who voted to block a No Deal Brexit this week. It was a radical move on his part, but contrary to what the moaners and whingers have been bleating about, it was not without precedent in parliamentary history. Furthermore, the rebels knew exactly what they were doing.

These self-serving men and women – many of them not proper Conservatives anyway - all received fair warning that their arrogance and disloyalty would have consequences. When you commit an act of political sabotage, you earn your punishment.

Johnson’s decisiveness proves something much more significant than just his ability to bring his party to heel, however. For the events of this summer confirm that the centre of gravity in British politics is shifting inexorably in favour of Brexit. A much-needed realignment is taking place. I have been arguing for this for years and I am only too delighted that the swamp is being drained at last.

Since mid-August, two Tory MPs, Sarah Woollaston and Phillip Lee, have defected to the Liberal Democrats. This is direct evidence of the sort of repositioning I have in mind. These turncoats were not prepared to honour the Conservatives’ Brexit manifesto pledge on which they stood happily at the 2017 general election, so they have decamped. That neither MP has had the courage to hold a by-election having crossed the floor tells you all you need to know about their true principles and priorities, incidentally. Frankly, the Liberal Democrats deserve them.

At the same time, other Remain Tory MPs have announced that they will not stand for election again. To them I say: good riddance.

Twenty-four hours with Nigel Farage
If you are not prepared to respect the wishes of the majority of British people, but instead use your privileged position in public life to try to render their votes meaningless, you have no place in politics anyway. It is my sincere wish that other Remain agitators will follow the lead of disgraceful figures like Oliver Letwin in retiring so that real democracy can be restored.

It is remarkable to think that in 1993, at the height of the heated debates over the Maastricht Treaty, then-prime minister John Major labelled those Eurosceptics in his Cabinet with whom he disagreed as ‘bastards’. Twenty-six years later, is it not the case that the roles have been reversed, and that the Remainers are in fact the bastards? One need only think of the extent of the plotting and scheming of former Conservative chancellor Philip Hammond to realise how appropriate Major’s colourful language is.

Hammond, and other pro-EU fanatics like him, has contributed to this country’s political reputation on the international stage being questioned and in some cases lampooned since 2016. In America, there is widespread amazement that not only has the Brexit vote been disregarded so far, but that Britain would want to remain shackled to an undemocratic political union.

If the skirmishes and battles being fought by Johnson are to have any meaning at all, and the general election which this country so badly needs is to result in the pro-Brexit outcome which the majority of voters crave, the prime minister must take the obvious next step of agreeing an electoral pact with The Brexit Party.

I welcome the comments made this week by the new chairman of the ERG, Steve Baker, who warned that Britain will “lose” Brexit unless Johnson does a deal with my party. Baker knows it is blindingly obvious that the Tories simply cannot secure seats in certain parts of the country that voted Leave, but that The Brexit Party would win there. Having spent Wednesday evening in Doncaster, which I would cite as a case in point, this has never been clearer to me.

Johnson should cast his mind back to the European elections in May, in which his party came fifth, and ask himself: does he want the Tories to find themselves in a similarly disastrous position when the results of the next general election come in, or does he want to sign a non-aggression with me and return to Downing Street?

I am 100 per cent sincere in this offer. We are not playing political games. I have spent more than 25 years fighting for Brexit. It is now within our grasp - I can almost taste it.",,/r/europe/comments/d11nkx/i_am_100_per_cent_sincere_in_offering_a/ezg3vwj/,PorTruffle,1567890805

Russia at the time was constructing 4 Dreadnoughts, later completed, and would attempt to build another 3 during the war, alongside 4 battlecruisers, which were ultimately scrapped. And the lack of other battleships which denote ""pre-dreadnoughts"" here is due to the sinking of the Russians at Tsushima in 1905. 
Alongside this the navy was not Russias primary means of projecting power, and did not require its protection as it had no overseas possessions.

UK is running out of already borrowed time and has no constructive options left as its politicians rejected all offers and counterproposals. EU gave their shot and counterproposals with may and won't bend anymmore than as it already did since uncertainty hurts it more than the actual divorce with more time passing while staying in this ambiguous status.

It's too late for forming a new plan and EU already gave UK their hobson's choice while May was still in the office.

The only deal to which EU agreed upon was May's but UK gov has been blocked while they still were in the haggling mode, not considering it honestly as an ultimatum.

Hell might rise with canceling Brexit altogether even if majority of citizens is against a No-Deal, it would be undemocratic as the vote has been cast, politicians care too much for their heads too much to consider it as an option to take without a second referendum, unfortunately UK doesn't (again) have enough time to do it.

Johnson has no real plan thus he's hellbent on No-Deal as he'll be able to shift the blame of future struggles on others who blocked his make-believe proposals, he will try to run down the clock most likely since No-Deal is blocked but nobody in their right mind will let him have his way.

4165,"&gt; I repeat, the Germans did not want to be a part of the Czechoslovakian state.

Perhaps if back then Austria-Hungary was a democracy and someone would have asked Czechs if they want to be a part of that, they would have also said no. But of course ordinary citizens didn't have any voting rights in Austria-Hungary.

The fact is that there is no god-given right of every minority to set up their own country where they want. Sudetengermans happened to live in a strategically important area of Czechoslovakia and it wasn't possible for us to let it go. We would have ended up with an undefesible torso of a country that would have no chance to protect itself against possible aggression coming from the German state.

Germans however had full voting rights in Czechoslovakia and as such could have decided to participate in the country as active citizens. Or if the idea of sharing a country with Czechs, without being the preferred group of people like they were in Austrian empire was so unbearable to them, they could have moved to Germany or Austria which already were ethnic German states. Czechs and Slovaks on the other hand had nowhere else to go, Czechoslovakia was their only option and Sudetenland was a vital part of it.

So yeah, Sudetengermans made their choice and unfortunately paid for it later on.

No one of this justifies French and British approach to the Munich conference. They negotiated over a country that wasn't theirs, agreed with not inviting Czechoslovakia there and told us that if we didn't agree, we would be seen as the obstacle to peace in Europe and treated accordingly. They did not do so out of the concern for Sudetengermans, but simply because they wanted to avoid war with Germany. They never cared about what would happen to the people living here, this was simply an expendable piece of land. In fact if Nazi Germany only led their war in Eastern Europe and never attacted Western Europe, they would have probably watched gladly how Germany and the Soviet Union weaken each other, without giving a shit how many people the Soviets and Germans massacred in the countries in between them.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/d0t754/five_ambassadors_protest_against_the/ezetf5i/,kristynaZ,1567868600

4169,"The fact, which I do not dispute, that a unified army would be more efficient than a combined-armies approach, does not in itself justify the creation of such a force and the subsequent loss of national autonomy. Efficiency is not the goal, assured defence is. I would also make the point that we should not be trying to make the delivery of violence more efficient or easier. Going to war *should* be a difficult, expensive, and slow process.   

I would also very much doubt that the EU nations would find themselves *suddenly* in a position where they were in danger and time was against us. There simply is no power on earth which could realistically endanger the EU, outside of the use of nuclear weapons in which case we're all fucked anyway. You might point to Russia, to which I would respond by pointing out that the most Russia can manage is a nasty little proxy war in the Ukraine over an area some 600km^sq (about twice the size of Malta), while facing increasing political resistance at home. You might then point to the US, to which I would mention that the US, for all its might, is just now wrapping up its war in Afghanistan, exchanging *18 years* of fighting for the Taliban to pinky-swear to never do it again. You may also mention terrorism, to which I would reply that you do not fight terrorists with armies, you fight them with police and intelligence forces. 

I had not mentioned NATO, as the EU is - by my reckoning anyway - fine without them in the first place, and while NATO is around the need for an EU army is even more lessened in the second. My arguments stand whether NATO exists or not - there just is no *need* for an EU army other than to support European arms manufacturing.  

The separation of armies may not be efficient, but it carries enormous social and political weight, and it also enables individual nation states to carry out operations on their own without involving the others. France, for example, is active in Mali, while Germany is not. Separation may not be neat, tidy, and efficient, but it allows for nuance and flexibility. Indeed, given the disparity of languages and customs within the EU, separation may actually work *better* than unification.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/d00vir/what_do_you_guys_think/ezeti4f/,theoldkitbag,1567868633

For France and the UK, if the hostilities were kept between Germans and Russians, it would have been mission accomplished, no matter how many people Russians and Germany slaughtered in the Eastern Europe.

4196,"&gt; But USSR was already winning by the time any significant supplies were  sent by USA and UK

Define ""significant"". Lend-lease winned time for USSR and allow them rapidly close critical issues while they relocate industry and rebuild economy itself.

 Later Khrushchev  will mention about ""land-lease"" in his memoirs ""... *First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated  several times when we were ""discussing freely"" among ourselves. He  stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not  have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we  could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have  lost the war*."" 

&gt;And USA and UK did barely any fighting against  Germany. 

USA was busy in Pacific and other war theatres. UK was busy fighting in Europe (protecting their own Island), Africa, Pacific ,Asia.

4311,"&gt; Before the Polish–Soviet war, Jan Kowalewski, a polyglot and amateur cryptologist, managed to break the codes and ciphers of the army of the West Ukrainian People's Republic and of General Anton Denikin's White Russian forces during his service in the Polish–Ukrainian War. As a result, in July 1919 he was transferred[by whom?] to Warsaw, where he became chief of the Polish General Staff's radio-intelligence department. By early September he had gathered a group of mathematicians from Warsaw University and Lwów University (most notably, founders of the Polish School of Mathematics—Stanisław Leśniewski, Stefan Mazurkiewicz and Wacław Sierpiński), who succeeded in breaking Soviet Russian ciphers as well. Decoded information presented to Piłsudski showed that Soviet peace proposals with Poland in 1919 were false and that in reality the Soviets had prepared for a new offensive against Poland and had concentrated military forces in Barysaw near the Polish border. Piłsudski decided to ignore the Soviet proposals, to sign an alliance with Symon Petliura of the Ukrainian People's Republic, and to prepare the Kiev Offensive. During the war, Polish decryption of Red Army radio messages made it possible to use small Polish military forces efficiently against the Soviet Russian forces and to win many individual battles, most importantly the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.[44][45][46]

So Poland should just have sat quiet and waited for the Russian civil war to end, so Russia could invaded them better?

They have no idea what the market needs or wants, because they spend their time getting EU money and dealing with that bureaucracy.

4402,"&gt;The whole ""children will die so they have lots of them"" is plain wrong. If the children died, there wouldn't be a population problem in Africa.

1 in 9 children die before 5 in sub-Saharan Africa.

&gt;The children don't die, that's what causing the population boost. That is mostly solved.

Yes. This is an ***expected part*** of the demographic curve. Literally the EXACT SAME THING happened in Europe and every single other country that has completed the transition, and these countries are now making the transition FASTER than we did!

The birth rate starts dropping as the reality of fewer child deaths becomes more and more apparent, *which is why African fertility rates ARE dropping* in most countries not afflicted by constant catastrophe like civil war.

The average Iranian woman had SEVEN kids in 1960, and today she has less than several Western-European countries. Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries on earth and had a peak birth rate of 6,94 in 1971, and today it is less than *2,1.* That's the same as the US in 2007.
This is a *universal* trend, *regardless* of culture. Especially those two examples are in no way cultures where having kids is culturally seen as undesirable or bad in any way.

&gt;The whole ""children die so they have lots of them"" can only be applied to tribal communities.

lol. ""Tribal communities"" are far more likely to have something resembling sanitary conditions and fewer disease vectors than any big city family is.

4524,"&gt; Isn't it harder to diagnose autism in girls though cause in general they are more high functioning from early on?

As a mom with an autistic daughter I just want to point out that autism is a spectrum, there are autistic people that need little help in their daily life to conform to ""societies needs"" and live a so called normal life and autists that need a high level of attention with lots of personal special care. 

Many autistic women have a biological advantage because as women we are often wired to be more socially connected and have an easier time verbally expressing ourselves. Boys who you see ""acting out"" are not acting out their autism so to speak but often the stimulus that they receive, cannot be verbally expressed and that creates frustration. As you might be aware many autistic people can be sensitive to certain smells, textures, sounds etc. Imagine something freaking you out and you can't calm down but are not able to describe it either. You are trapped.

Women mask it more, they look at their surroundings and adapt by copying behavior. 
That behavior is often of someone that is not on the spectrum so they kinda fake it till they make it. Little ""oddities"" like not being able to hold eye contact is often being described as shy, which is a characteristic trait we easily accept from girls and doesn't help in diagnosing. In itself it is often a good strategy to fly under the radar when it comes to being spotted as autist but can create emotional meltdowns because they are pretending to the outside world which that takes a mental toll cause it's so damn tiring to act a certain way every day of your life.
It also is a perfect recipe for self image issues and depressions cause they realize at a certain point that they are accepted by being fake and the only way to have friends is to not be themselves basically.

Your bringing up the existence of ""Greeks"" (quotes to refute the assumed equivalence of populations nearly a millennium apart) in response is justification of massacre, ethnic cleansing, chauvinist nationalism and nationalist historical revisionism.

Pray tell mr Turk what is the maximum time after which we must ignore history and force a break in identity between peoples? I am pretty sure there are no quotes around Turks in your mind. I wonder if there are around Armenians

4854,"Since you mention it a few times, I should probably expound a bit more on my thoughts on media bias and political messaging in reporting. All media is biased, because every author inherently is writing from a certain point of view. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; I would certainly want an article about hurricane damage to be written from the point of view that people losing their homes or being injured is a bad thing. But that *is* a point of view, and it will show in the articles. Treating Democratic stances and Republican stances as equal is also a point of view (a centrist bias is not the same thing as being unbiased). The important questions, then, are:

1. What is the author's point of view, and is it reasonable?
2. Is the purpose of this media to describe the facts as the author understands them, or to persuade me to the author's point of view?
3. How honest is this publication about the answers to #1 and #2?

I'd like to think I'm not too picky about #1 - I'm willing to entertain pretty much anything from social liberalism to anarcho-communism as, broadly speaking, ""reasonable."" Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean I *agree* with all of those perspectives, just that I consider them reasonable *enough* to be worth reading. Nevertheless, this is where I have qualms with a lot of media sources. Many of them are so desperate to appear unbiased that they'll treat wildly unequal positions with equal respect. Used to be creationism and evolution, then it was (and still is, to some extent) climate change and climate denialism, now it's trans rights and transphobia, or ""telling people of color who were born here to go back to their home countries is racist and wrong"" and... well, you get the idea. I don't think reporting those as equivalent to be a reasonable point of view. If a politician does something racist, *report it as such*, don't weasel around it with ""critics say..."" or ""racially divisive language.""

Point 2 is where publications like *Jacobin* get ruled out. Don't get me wrong, persuasive or argumentative articles are fine, and I'd even say they're an important part of a media diet, in moderation. But you're not going to get a complete understanding of current events by only reading left-wing (or right-wing, or centrist, or whatever) analysis and opinions. You also need some descriptive reporting. (In fairness, *Jacobin* makes no claim to be a newspaper or equivalent to one.)

Basically, I'm looking for a publication that (1) primarily deals in descriptive reporting, (2) has a reputation for accuracy, and (3) has a reasonable point of view / does not maintain a false sense of balance. A lot of the publications you link are great, but most of them are magazines, not newspapers, and so have much the same issue as *Jacobin* -- they're worth reading, but they're not a news source.

So it was only natural to have the German capital in the Prussian capital.

Before that, Berlin was never seen as a ""German capital"". Frankfurt was the de-facto capital of the German Confederation and of the short lived German Empire of 1848/49.

This is why he is pushing for the election, but his shadow cabinet are advising against it. Elections are not happening right now as it only supports the people who no deal. Since the opposition wants either a deal or not to leave, its better to postpone and have an election later.

With or without a deal has never been put to the public, so stating that there is a public consensus for leaving with no deal is incorrect. There were only options for leave or not in the referendum. The non-binding referendum only advised that a majority wanted to leave the EU. There was no question regarding leaving with a deal or no deal. 

The Irish border will become the only mainland border with the EU, so there has to be some kind of control around that border. This is the whole backstop argument. UK don’t want it and the EU don’t really want it, but there are few ways to resolve the issue without a control unless Northern Ireland agrees to all terms that the EU has. If NI agrees to the terms then the rest of the UK is bound by these terms, since the states act as one country and don’t want to differentiate their import/export laws.

5013,"&gt;am not sure about the exact metabolic pathways but the sucrose they were fed should be enough to produce amino acids

The main source of amino acids from any diet is from proteins ( plant or animal) you can't possibly say that they got enough amino acids especially the 3 that were inhibited from eating basically pure sugar. I  refuse to believe this and you don't believe it either.

&gt;The fact that the guy and you are talking about amino acids in their diet when it is about blocking the synthesis of amino acid is pretty ridiculous.

Are you not getting this. Glyphosate ends the synthesis of 3 amino acids in bacteria. The bacteria can no longer produce the amino acids. But that doesn't matter because the bees eat things ( proteins) which break down into amino acids so the gut bacteria aren't without it. The pure sugar solution doesn't provide these nutritional benefits so when added with glyphosate the bacteria don't have that compensatory source of amino acids which naturally they do have. Is that hard to get.

&gt; You do not need amino acids to synthesize amino acids

I never said you did, the bacteria need it to have optimal growth. Glyphosate ends that process in bacteria and plants. But since bacteria are already swimming in an environment rich with amino acids it doesn't matter. It's like losing your job when you're already a billionaire. You'll still be able to live the lifestyle your accustomed.


&gt;Also no idea where you are getting n=6 from. The smallest sample size was 11 unless I am overlooking something and you want to quote it.

This is the study from Buenos Aires, one of the graphs shows n is 6.


&gt;Obviously a bigger N is always better but considering how many things they were measuring this would have been a huge scope for the study

Probably better not to publish it then. Especially when so few insects actually came back.

&gt;He does ignore the fact that there is a control group. If his theory about the lack of essential amino acids was true then this would also influence the control group. Thats why you use control groups.

No, it doesn't because with the pure sugar solution without glyphosate there is no disabling of the shikimate pathway. So the billionaire basically has a job that provides him millions but let's say he lost his current assets. You can test this out by removing those bacteria from the amino acid rich gut and just putting them in a petri dish, they'll still be fine because they're producing to amino acids endogenously. This isn't too hard a concept to get. Bacteria both, make and have an environment that has amino acids so they have two strategies to rely on. In times of plenty and in meager times.


&gt;But hey there is a very clear difference between the control group and the glyphosate groups

The type of control group you use matters. We want to represent bees as close to a pristine state as possible, so use a diet that they usually eat, like pollen laced nectar or something and then lace test groups nectar with glyphosate. This would show any differential affects, they're using an unhealthy and uncommon group to make assumptions about the general population of bees. Both bees are nutritionally defecient and even then, bees with more glyphosate flew home faster than bees with less glyphosate. So it's noise, most likely.


&gt;He says they did not prove that the change has a detrimental effect. No shit.

Why have you linked it in response to comments saying that glyphosate has no detrimental effects. And why have green groups used the study as an impetus to ban glyphosate? This is what him and I are fighting against.

&gt;As if it´s somehow bad or unusual that a single paper does not explore an issue in its entirety and in every facet.

If you explore an issue with faulty methodology you'll get faulty assumptions. It's the job of all scientist to criticize papers. That's how we get better science.

&gt;He does it again with saying no bacteria were eradicated.

Eradicated, meaning that they weren't extinct from the gut. Eradication means total and completely destroyed, so your statement is criticizing nothing. He's saying that no bacterial colonies were completely destroyed and there was already variance in the bacterial concentrations, so it might be readily explained by random variance and that might explain the compositional changes.

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eradicate


&gt;As for the pathogen spreading he only really says some vague shit about the sugar solution not being what they´d eat in the wild. Again not a fair criticism.

This is totally fair criticism. If the authors thrust is that glyphosate kills off bacteria that might protect bees from a pathogen. And the effect here was found only in bees that eat plane raw sugar, then it's fair to say that bees don't usually eat plain sugar and the gut microbiota won't be perturbed and therefore the pathogen won't effect the bee groups differentially. Perfectly good point.

&gt;He provides no evidence for his claim that this would not be an issue in the wild because their diet would compensate

It's the authors jobs to provide evidence, they're making the claim. If Andrew Wakefield says that vaccines cause autism, it's his job to prove it and mine to criticize it until proven inscrutable.
 

&gt;It gets even more ridiculous when he compares it to scurvy. The actual comparison would be if you and your friend both lacked vitamin C and you also had a particularly fatty diet but he didn´t get sick while you did. Which would of course imply that it is the fatty diet.

No, it would be both effects working together. He's saying you can't single out vit C. So yes glyphosate and eating pure raw sugar has combined deliterious effects. But bees don't eat raw sugar so the combined effect is nullified. Maybe combined isn't the right term, but maybe instead no amino acids as catalyst for a reaction that would be too slow to matter in a bees lifetime. It's like saying oxygen is a neurotoxin in certain conditions were not exposed too. So no the criticism stands.

&gt;The whole stick about why they are holding centrifuge tubes afterwards is just sad. Has the guy ever seen news articles about scientists? They always get them to pose with stuff like that. 

Just a bit of humor and a critique of why they make scientists do that In the first place. Plenty of experiments don't use centrifuges. 

&gt;If he really is a biochemist (he calls himself a chemist on his website)

Biochemist take only primary biology classes to understand how live makes compounds. They're a type of chemist and usually use the term interchangeably.

5033,"&gt;The Allies refused to let the civilian population be evacuated, despite offers of free passage by the fortress commander.

Just to be clear, that's strongly disputed by two British majors in the unit involved, one the intelligence officer, the other a staff officer who was present at the meeting. According to them the German commander was asked if he would allow the civilians to leave and he refused, and when offered 48 hours to reconsider, he again refused. 

I can see the value for the German in having French civilians in the town in the hope of deterring bombardment, I can't see the value to the allies in forcing them to stay.

The original claims that the allies wouldn't allow them to leave come from the local newspaper (published under German control) and William Douglas Home, a British officer (and brother of the subsequent Prime Minster) who refused orders to attack Le Havre and published his claims in a British newspaper.

The German approved newspaper is obviously suspect, William Douglas Home was a strong opponent of the war, had wanted to make peace with Germany from the beginning, and opposed the policy of unconditional surrender.

5230,"As a Kurd, when I see threads like this, I also check in to see when a Turk will decide to excuse their crimes and pin it on Kurds. They did not surprise me, typical post of such excuses here already.

They're essentially trying everything in the book to change history. Excuses, whataboutism and pinning it on others is their game. It's really weird as they personally did not commit the crime, they aren't connected probably, but by making excuses, trying to change history they are essentially getting blood on their hands. They do this with crimes against Kurds. I don't get it, why they sit there and defend other peoples vile acts..How do they benefit..

I am from Dersim (Kurdish area in Turkey) and there used to be a large Armenian population. We used to have Churches over there, now there is NONE. They were spared the first onslaught of ethnic cleansing of the area by hiding amongst the Kurds, but when the Kurds decided to break from the Ottoman empire the Turkish attack on the Kurds also further wiped out the Armenians as their invasion came in more numbers, so again NOT all Kurds took part and Kurds suffered for protecting the Armenians. I know this, because my mothers side is Armenian and Armenians talk about Dersim protecting Armenians. Dersim people tell the stories of what happened to us and to them by the Turks.

Today, Kurdish leaders and the Kurdish community have stepped up and do not deny Kurdish involvement and regret their grandfathers acts. They call it what it is, a genocide and have apologised for **their** involvement. However saying that, I refuse to accept Turkish crimes be pinned on us and I will not allow history to be changed. The way Turks describe it is that Kurds somehow basically did all the killings and Turks sat back and watched.

Kurds who killed Armenians didn't do it purely because some lust for blood and desire for personal gain. It has been proven and recorded many times by historians doing actual research (speaking to people who were alive at the time, finding documents documenting the acts) on the subject in those areas how the Ottoman leaders higher up came to attack and flush out Armenians. Some tribes who refused met the same fate and that was the fear driving Kurds to follow through. Over time Kurds did take the areas that Armenians once owned, because there were no more Armenians there any longer.. They use this as some kind of excuse.

As I said, Kurds today don't deny their involvement and have apologised, the only reason why I am explaining and of what they did is so they don't change history and tell it in a way that as usual, shift blame.",,/r/europe/comments/d0cso0/states_which_have_recognized_the_armenian/eza9tcl/,savasfreeman,1567797402

I agree that their chances of realistically threatening NATO countries either directly or indirectly receded over the decades, especially in the 1970s and 1980s as the 1960s post-colonialist civil wars had shown that even though they might put lots of resources into getting those countries on a communist or quasi-communist path, in the end it didn't work out so well.

5358,"&gt; How many people were actually opposed to the Nazi regime because I don't remember any resistance movements except for the White Rose and for the Abhwer leader.

Easier said than done and it's very convenient to look back in hindsight and make judgements, especially if you are ignorant of many facts. There came a point in the war where it became a defensive action for German soldiers and not a war of expansion and aggression anymore. The Americans and the Russians wished to completely destroy Germany. Read up on the Morgenthau plan. From the second half of 1942, onward Germans not only fought to hold on to their gains, but also to try and prevent the red Army from steamrolling them and conquering and potentially destroying Germany. If they had surrendered or stopped fighting as you suggest they should have, that would could have been the end of their country from their perspective. Not fighting or betraying your own nation at that point meant you potentially contributed to its total destruction.

Things were not as simple as you are seeing it now in hindsight, dude, so try to be less judgmental.

&gt;18 million people served in the Wehrmacht, 3 million commuted war crimes, the rest helped those 3 million commit war crimes by not stopping them and covering their backs.

This is a truly ridiculous take. This can be said for every single army fighting an imperial war of expansion in history. Look what the English did to the French countryside in the hundred years war. Look what happened in the 30 years war and countless others. Look what happened during the Yugoslav war in the 1990's. It is always the case where even though the organization is fighting for an evil cause and many of it's soldiers willingly and gleefully or under obligation do evil things, there are always many individuals who avoid as best as they can to do things that are evil.

Besides, it's real easy to talk from your comfortable armchair. Wait until you are in a similar situation as those German soldiers were before you judge so callously.",Dalmatia,/r/europe/comments/d0clx0/german_tourist_sued_for_complaints_about_hotels/ez9h3tm/,Alakobyn96,1567782134

It is your choice to remain willfully ignorant and oversimplify a massively complicated situation if that makes you feel better. It wasn't as simple for Germans to just ""stop fighting"" as you are suggesting they should have. They ended up in a situation where they were honestly fighting to prevent the total destruction of their nations, or at least that is what they were told to believe. A Russian victory in the East could have resulted in the Russians conquering and completely destroying Germany.

There was also the Morgenthau plan that leaked out. Have you ever heard of the Morgenthau plan and do you understand its implications?

The Morgenthau plan was for a period endorsed by Roosevelt, and it called for the total destruction of Germany as a nation. German land would have been stripped of all industry and would have been divided up between neighbouring nations to use as farmland.

Thus there came a point where the war for German soldiers was not a war of aggression anymore, but a war to prevent the Allies and Soviets from completely destroying their homeland. At that point betraying your side and joining some kind of resistance took on a whole other meaning.

But I specifically said that we shouldn't let countries ignore their past crimes. Even if some do, it shouldn't be an excuse for us not mentioning or raising awareness of the Genocide.

I would also argue that the fact that most countries don't directly acknowledge the genocide is because of Turkey, not the other way around. Turkey (especially under Erdogan) acts very aggressively to any country or institution that acknowledges the Genocide(the most recent example being the Pope). Most countries want to stay in Turkeys good side so they turn a blind eye to its history.

5470,"&gt; the prices in France aren't subsidised

As per EDF, capital costs, which are the single largest contributor to the lifetime cost of nuclear plants, are not factored into their prices. What this means is that the French state has ponied up the funds for this and passed the costs to taxpayers, albeit not via levies on retail electricity prices like Germany does. It's an open question as to what extent the French state is still paying for those investments today because France does not publish this information. 

&gt; German renewables are, over and above the wholesale electricity price, which is why their retail prices are so high.

Renewables are a factor in wholesale electricity markets. If your argument is that new renewable capacity can't compete with existing profitable coal or nuclear capacity, well, duh. The same applies to new coal or nuclear capacity. Any new capacity intended to displace profitable operating capacity will require subsidies as investors will demand returns.

&gt; Wholesale prices do not show subsidies, and it's subsidies that add so much to bills now. That's why Denmark and Germany, with the highest share of wind/solar in Europe, have such high bills.

That's precisely the difference between Denmark/Germany and France. The former two transparently pass the costs of their energy subsidies to consumers, whereas France obscures those costs for political reasons.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/d0cykf/electricity_prices_in_europe/ez97aqq/,blunderbolt,1567775062

We would let go of it if Croats wouldn't celebrate it every year and make it the hallmark of their national identity.

I don't know about Brittany but we already have signs in french and provençau and that change nothing.

Thre isn't a limited number of language we can learn, but time is limited. Unfortunately we don't have just languages to learn, we also have maths, History, sciences, technologyand litterature in schools and that's already a lot for children. And no, we can't just learn one at home. Currently we have 19,8% of our teens who are illiterate according to the OCDE. If we just learn french at home this number will burst, and this would create more inequality, the poorest already have a difficult access to french, with your idea it will be way worse. This will create a casted society just like India or France during the old regim.

Occitan pre-school ? Did you read what i wrote ? Occitan designs a linguistic area with no supra-dialects like unlikes others linguistic areas. There is no Occitan language but multiple occitan languages with multiple writtings in concurrence. Just for provençal you have provençal maritime, provençal rhodanien, gavot. With two concurrent graphy, Mistralienne and classique. Which one do you chose ? The question is impossible to respond and to force all children to learn an occitan dialect is impossible we don't have enough speaker to mandatory this class. Enforcing dialects will be a great step backward, people can learn it if they want i don't see why we should force them to do so. 

Of course we can't be anything else, whether you're french whether you're not, when you become french you leave everything behind this is true equality. I don't see the problem, this is your ideology which is flawed by my point of view. By making different cases of a same thing you obligatory create a hierarchy between them and this goes against equality.

Well the country is already largely less centralized that it used to be. We surely need a decentralisation economically but not in term of dialects. The absence of dialects doesn't spoil us from having a regional identity.

We don't have any colony left so why are you talking about colonies ? This ideology is already here, everywhere, in what language are we talking ? English ? Is this language from my country ? No. Did i have to learn it ? Yes. Why ?

Yes and this means choosing to close the border as well. Closing the border is part of the decision, because when you leave the EU, you get a border to the EU, and the outside EU border is closed because that is how it has always worked &amp; it is weird you are not aware of that.

&gt;Not sure what you mean by this? We're aware that a hard border is possible. Unfortunatly the EU / RoI are refusing to have negotiations to minimise this.

&gt;Not sure what you mean by this? We're aware that a hard border is possible

It is not just possibly, it is the default outcome. The only way to keep it open would be to have NI stay in the inner market.

5525,"&gt;Indeed they haven't. If you read the article the UK is trying to defend its internal market (which is very laudable)

We intend to keep it intact.

&gt;expects the EU in return to give up its own internal market.

We'd like fairly good access to the EU market. Hardly asking you to give it up.

&gt;Eh, trade deals take years to form, dates could be shuffled around. Send the proposal in, you may just have solved everyone's problem.

Easiest and best way is to have a time limit with a mutual extension possible. That way we will leave only if you are messing around and not working towards a long term solution.

&gt;Good news, you already have. Always had.

Yet Brussels continues to rule over us. We are not independent.

&gt;Also keep in mind that the thing about the backstop is that odds are it never gets activated. WA is just a transition period, if at the end EU &amp; UK have a trade deal, then the backstop never gets activated (and the independence you already had, is still yours to have)

Of course it would be activated. It gives the EU everything it would ever want. It gives them access to the UK goods market (where they have a huge surplus), but stops us accessing the EU services market (where we have a large surplus). It allows them to pimp us out to third parties in trade deals, yet we don't get access to those countries. It also means that they can control our markets to our disadvantage - making UK goods illegal, so that our companies have to alter their standards to continue selling nationally.

&gt;Hey now, we gotta respect the UK's decision to give up its vote, say in matters and seat at the table.

We are voting to leave entirely, not be ruled by you.

&gt;UK was a well appreciated partner from the start.

Literal propaganda.

&gt;UK was ruling with the leaders of EU nations.

Yes, but that does nothing to help us when the EU only serves the core. We were still a colony ruled by Brussels, which cares only for France, Germany and the Benelux.

No, the prices in France aren't subsidised. German renewables are, over and above the wholesale electricity price, which is why their retail prices are so high.

According to the Council of European Energy Regulators, as of 2014 France spent 3.5 billion Euros on renewable subsidies, Germany spent 19.7 billion. Per KWH generated, that added 3.15c to German bills, 0.6c to French bills. As large electricity consumers use a lot of electricity and don't pay those subsidies, consumers end up paying the lions share of the subsidies. 

Wholesale prices do not show subsidies, and it's subsidies that add so much to bills now. That's why Denmark and Germany, with the highest share of wind/solar in Europe, have such high bills.",,/r/europe/comments/d0cykf/electricity_prices_in_europe/ez8zn2m/,WhiteSatanicMills,1567767757

5632,"Again, it is surprising how much bullshit you can swallow. Firstly, Italian economy has nothing to do with Greek economy; the very fact that you are grouping the two countries together show how utter your ignorance on the matter is. Secondly, Italy's industry was booming because this was, and still is despite its gradual weakening, one of the biggest industrialized countries in Europe and the world. The mere idea of NATO funds (I'd like to know to how much they amounted) being the source of decades of prosperity and one of the biggest GDP in the world is laughable and shows how deep your ignorance of economic matters is; and shows you superiority complex and the amount of bullshit you guys can swallow.

&gt; Like Greece, the population wanted the same benefits to continue, which led to inflation, loans, bad financial decisions to keep the population pleased. It was unsustainable, and crashed

The idiocy of this comfortable (for you) narrative, and the utter ridiculousness of your idea about American funds, is shown among other things by [this nice graph](https://tradingeconomics.com/italy/government-debt-to-gdp) about Italy's debt to GDP ratio. From the early 1990s - that is, after the end of the Cold War and of your imaginary influx of American funds - to the early 2000s, the debt decreased by 20 %, because in spite of your flawed view, goverment spending was firmly under control, whereas the economy was growing (since you can't reduce debt to GDP by merely cutting spending if the economy isn't growing, something that the austerity retards are too stupid to understand). Our debt exploded thanks to the 2008 financial crisis, which was caused not by Italian banks - which were and are among the most careful in the world - but by the reckless behaviour of unscrupulous banks of certain countries who think of themselves as virtuous.

Gas prices feel in the second half of 2014 for the first time after Gazprom agreed to lower the price for the first time. I mean it might that Gazprom had a sudden change of heart or they felt that LNG terminal in Klaipeda will start working whether they like it or not.

Personally, not a big believer in coincidences. Also, Lithuania had the largest drop in overall gas price in the EU. In 2014 gas price in Lithuania was equal to 74% of average gas price in the EU. In 2019 gas price in Lithuania was 60% of EU's average. In the same time gas price in the EU dropped by only 5% overall.

Other countries that rely almost 100% on Russian gas saw gas price remain the same as in 2014, or decrease up to 10% most.

It's not like only the Chinese do this kind of thing, Europeans do exactly the same kind of tours when they go around China.

I have. Greece roughly 2000 miles away. Even the closer olive growing regions in Spain are a thousand miles away.

&gt;It's not just Greek stuff, Spain Italy and Greece are literally the three largest global producers, even ahead of the ginormous US.

And perhaps without EU protectionism other growers would make more.

&gt;And again, you don't have any tariffs currently my man you're in the EU.

There are tariffs on olive oil from outside the EU. I don't see why we should apply tariffs to Californian olive oil, but not Greek olive oil.

&gt;So your position is that you will import better and cheaper olive oil, from the US who god know how much it produces anyway, which is thousands of miles of ocean further away, and this will be better for you.

My position is that we should aim to get better trade deals by offering more in areas such as this where the EU couldn't but we absolutely should (because we have no domestic production).

* Creating a public nuisance:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuisance

&gt; Over the last 1000 years, public nuisance has been used by governmental authorities to stop conduct that was considered quasi-criminal because, although not strictly illegal, it was deemed unreasonable in view of its likelihood to injure someone in the general public. Donald Gifford[19] argues that civil liability has always been an ""incidental aspect of public nuisance"".[20] Traditionally, actionable conduct involved the blocking of a public roadway, the dumping of sewage into a public river or the blasting of a stereo in a public park.[21] To stop this type of conduct, governments sought injunctions either enjoining the activity that caused the nuisance or requiring the responsible party to abate the nuisance. 

-

&gt;In practice, the law works so that if one member of the neighborhood feels that there is a neighbor's noise level is annoying or excessively loud, that neighbor is instructed to inform the town police so that they can respond to the location of the noise. ""The responding officer has some discretion in how to deal with the noise complaint.... When determining the appropriate response, the officer may take many factors into consideration, such as the severity of the noise, the time of day, whether the residents have been warned before, the cooperation of the residents to address the problem.""[24][25] 

* Disorderly conduct

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorderly_conduct

&gt; Disorderly conduct is a crime in most jurisdictions in the United States, China, and Taiwan. Typically, ""disorderly conduct"" makes it a crime to be drunk in public, to ""disturb the peace"", or to loiter in certain areas. Many types of unruly conduct may fit the definition of disorderly conduct, as such statutes are often used as ""catch-all"" crimes. Police may use a disorderly conduct charge to keep the peace when people are behaving in a disruptive manner to themselves or others, but otherwise present no danger.

That is, most of the time, police will ignore things like this, but if there's some actual problem coming up, they have some legal basis to act to a limited extent.

Obviously, selective enforcement of the law is also open to abuse, but my guess is that most countries have some degree of selective enforcement of some minor crimes/infractions akin to this.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/d00rmy/most_wanted_in_germany_documentary/ez8q4cf/,vokegaf,1567753460

Here are the different type of turks about this issue. The values are my personal assessment. No resource.

40% : The turks from former armenian lands are very proud that they have killed and fought armenians. Some of them deny it in discussion but they are proud of them if they are just amongst them.

10%: Some turks were really attacked by armenians and for them was it just a war.

20%: Some educated turks deny just because as state politic. If the state would say, the sky is red, they would belive it also. Those are the angry guys, if this theme pops up

20%: Other educated turks do not deny and feel sorry

10%: Thinking about a historical research, opening of archieves etc because they are not sure about the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

ALso,  half of the turks dont care about armenian genocide, because they are proud of it and dont care at all what other countries think.
