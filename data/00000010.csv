1,"The sad story behind it is most of the big cities are secular and progressive, the rest of the country is pretty much villages and smaller towns - they tend to be very conservative. 

In the video it gets mentioned that Duda represents Pride and Decency (not that kind of pride you think).
It's all about family values, Christian values. But then all those towns and villages are exposed to only state run TV and radio, which are full of propaganda. Then you have a church that works with the government in exchange for donations and no tax. 

It is literally brainwashing people and anything progressive or technologically advanced is ""devil's work"".

On the video a wee kid says thank you for 500+, it's 500 PLN per kid (a month I believe) that family gets so the backwards population can spread out and what does it mean? More voters in the future. And obviously taxpayers are paying for all of that.

Grandma on the video has been praising Duda for being able to have food on a plate. To clarify Duda didn't finish the war or communism, he didn't provide anything significant that would let her afford basic necessities. He's just a face of the country - a very bad face in the international community.

Before PiS first took power in 2005 both parties were expected to form a coalition on the grounds of both having roots in christian democratic opposition in communist times. In fact one of the most prominent PO members to this day, Radosław Sikorski, was a member of PiS back then. Even now you can hear people saying that they're two sides of the same (conservative) coin, ignoring all the authoritarian tendencies of PiS.

PO is the ""big city"" fiscally liberal party with it's major talking points being lowering taxes and simplifying the bureacracy back then, but circumstances led them to mostly abandon those postulates, while still remaining in favor of status quo in regards to societal issues. This led to them losing voters from both sides - the people interested in the neoliberal fiscal policy felt that the party betrayed them, meanwhile social progressives who voted for them as the left wing parties basically imploded during that period were angry that no meaningful social change happened during their rule.",Silesia (Poland),/r/europe/comments/oegg12/donald_tusk_the_againappointed_leader_of_the_main/h47s7la/,Skrittz,1625558212

103,"It's a bit of a long story. Basically, before PiS took power, Poland was ruled for 8 years by PO (led by Donald Tusk for the most part), a center-right party which terms to be liberal on economic matters and supportive of status quo where worldview issues are involved. 2007-2015 has been a tumultuous time economically, as we all know, but PO liked to claim that they've achieved a great success by preventing Polish economy from going into recession (a ""green island"" as they liked to call it). That was however only half the truth, and maintaining the growth indicators was achieved through many decisions that disproportionately affected the poor (increase of the VAT tax, allowing for the so called trash contracts to spread). Many poorer people, people living in small towns and the countryside, felt abandoned. Their government was claiming that everything is great and the lives of Poles are improving, but they didn't see it reflected in their own lives.

Here comes PiS, which previously ruled between 2005-2007. They've assumed several welfare state policies, including a flagship 500+ policy (500PLN payed for each child except the first that a family has) which along with conservative worldview resonated well with the countryside. They basically had no competition in doing so: both agrarian PSL and socialdemocratic SLD were far too weak at the time to offer any real resistance.  Furthermore, the left wing vote begun to fracture, as new factions rose in an attempt to revitalize it, which ended up with none of the getting into Sejm (this is important, as in our system the more votes goes to parties that didn't get past the threshold, the better for the party with the most votes). As a result, PiS won and won big, taking control of both chambers of our Parliament. Since they've also won the presidential elections some time before that, they had complete power over the country without having to form a coalition with anyone.

So now this gets us to how they're staying in power. There are many factors. Partly, it's just the luck of the draw - world economy was doing pretty well before the pandemic. Part is actual merit - they've actually fulfilled some of their promises, in particular the 500+ program, which improved lives for many people. But then there are also the shadier aspects. One of the first things PiS did after wining in 2015 was purge public media (note, for many, particularly poorer, people the only one they have reliable access to) of any opposition voices. Furthermore, they're also closely aligned with the Catholic Church in Poland, which lends them their continues support.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/oegg12/donald_tusk_the_againappointed_leader_of_the_main/h47jt8x/,HadACookie,1625550964
104,"It would also work well in Low Saxon as grammatical gender is disappearing, heading into the same evolutionary direction as English (that is, only having he/she/it).

129,"Direct government control and government funding is what makes the difference between a public and a state broadcasters.

I think having publicly funded media is a good thing to have, but it needs to be reformed to minimize political interference. Such as it not being tax funded but rather funding itself (I know ""TV license"" is a meme, but that's how they fund themselves without political interference).

Additionally measures need to be taken to remove bias from the board such as ""over-representation"" of the the opposition (so it's closer to 50% even though they may only have 20% in parliament) or removing politicians altogether, etc.

After all private media is anything but non-biased, also. As it aims for profitability it also usually aims for extremely low quality of it's content. You will have a hard time finding good documentaries there for example. Usually only bottom of the barrel ""Ancient Aliens"" shit. Almost all quality documentaries that run on TV in Germany are using public broadcasters.

As public media doesn't work on a profitability goal (just don't make too much of a loss), it can aim more for quality.

It's just the overly simplified international perception, not some realistic thing on the ground. We are not similar to someone simply because most of the international community assumes this common label on us.

&gt;It seems as if Estonians (on the internet) think that as soon as they gained freedom from the Soviet Union and got an economy, living standard and so on the same level as western countries that they ""can into nordics"".

Absolutely not and this has never been anyone's idea. The idea is that we already *are* a Nordic country, have been for a very long time, and are not attempting to become anything else - it's just the international community that needs to change its perception to be closer to reality on the ground. Socio-economic differences hardly matter in this interpretation as it's first and foremost an aspect of common culture and national identity.

&gt;I do not think that Sweden is superior to Estonia at all.

Forcing a label down to another ethnic group and denying them their national identity to exclude them from a common regional identity you hold on to while admitting to not know shit about the country is a very clear sign of a superiority complex. Period.

288,"&gt;	I understand it may be difficult and I am not shunning anyone for having issues with this. Isn’t this what tolerance is about?

Struggling is fine. Sometimes when you know someone that transitions it might take a bit of time to get used. But no, this isn’t what tolerance is about. If someone is having legitimate difficulties pretty much nobody will mind. It is normal. If someone is going out of their way to be a dick, that is different. Tolerance doesn’t mean you should just smile when people are trying to be mean.

&gt;	Being honest, this is an information that I have never had to memorize myself as it was quite easy to determine if I am talking to a man or a woman.

You guys talk about the struggle of having to remember everyones gender, as if that is not something you do all the time. If one of your male friends showed up to a party wearing lipstick and a dress would you forget that they are male? Of course not. You know this person. You remember them. You would think “I guess he lost a bet”.

If a woman at your work place grew a bit of a mustache you wouldn’t go “who is that man?”. You would think “oh, poor girl. She should do something about that facial hair”.

You don’t make a new analysis of what gender your friends might be every time you meet them. You just remember it. You aren’t going to forget the gender of your friends. Even if you haven’t seen or heard your friends voice in over 10 years, and you have no idea what they look/sound like, you aren’t going to forget what gender they are.

Sorry, I just feel like this really isn’t that big of a deal. It strikes me as a big hypothetical problem that doesn’t really exist. I just don’t really understand the scenario you are warning of. You already remember the gender of literally everyone in your life.

I don’t understand how you can warn us of how hard it will be to remember everyones gender but also you have said that remembering someones gender has never been a problem for you at all.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/oe2nf7/croatian_most_politician_on_lgbt_people_they_need/h47es1a/,Leprecon,1625547121

Of what is depicted here only two parts were former german empire territory, the big blue spott in the north west and the small are in the south west.

One Poland got by ""uprising""/military invasion shortly post WW1 were germany was forbidden by the allies to send its actual army to deal with it so Poland created a Status Quo to their advantages that was later confirmed by the versailles treaty.

The second Poland got by starting an illegal invasion masked as an ""uprising"" in upper silesia following an internationally supervised election (the pro polish frenchw ere overseeing that with troops so no voting bullshit) on the issue of who gets upper silesia. The population voted clearly in favor of germany with around 60% pro germany despite 60% of the population considering itself partly polish. The people voted that way becuse they saw themselfs as Silesians first before Poles or germans and wanted to remain together with the rest of silesia. 80% of silesia was german so germany it was. Poland didnt accept that fair election and ordered its followers/militias in the area to start an armed uprising. the germans ordered there militas then to do the same (except it was still legally germany). Both sides send external forces (germany several advisers and small Freikorps units and poland a major unit based in warsaw) to support their sides. But the external polish forces were basically crossing into germany to fight so they were technically invading. After a wile the front becama a stalemate because the germans were again forbidden from sending the proper army in to dela with the uprising/invasion and the allies then split upper silesia basically 50/50 along the voting lines generally speaking. Only issue was that Poland got the huge coal mines in the south that way. But technically Poland broke the versailles treaty to get an advantage over the germans by inciting the rebellion AFTER the vote was over.

416,"Maybe read up on the history of measles.

&gt;Measles is an endemic disease, meaning it has been continually present in a community and many people develop resistance. In populations not exposed to measles, exposure to the new disease can be devastating. In 1529, a measles outbreak in Cuba killed two-thirds of those indigenous people who had previously survived smallpox. Two years later, measles was responsible for the deaths of half the population of Honduras, and it has ravaged Mexico, Central America, and the Inca civilization.  
&gt;  
&gt;The 1846 measles outbreak in the Faroe Islands was unusual for being well-studied. Measles had not been seen on the islands for 60 years, so almost no residents had any acquired immunity. Three-quarters of the residents got sick, and more than 100 (1–2%) died from it before the epidemic burned itself out.\*  
&gt;  
&gt;In 1914, a statistician for the Prudential Insurance Company estimated from a survey of 22 countries that 1% of all deaths in the temperate zone were caused by measles. 

\*0.1% of our population have died despite all of the lockdowns and restrictions.

What even is your point? You're trying to make out that the rate of transmission is completely irrelevant, even though we do that for currently endemic diseases and that the fact that we don't lockdown for them means that transmission of Covid is irrelevant? Surely given that it has necessitated such restrictions unlike other viruses is even more of a reason that case levels are important.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/oe99ds/at_least_180_infected_after_dutch_disco_despite/h46kv2h/,Eurovision2006,1625529564

No, but you are.

&gt; Bulgaria as way more need for an Army than Netherland

Says who? Are you even aware of the geopolitical challenges the Netherlands face that necessitate having a decent military?

&gt; yet is barely (by capita) above them. 

So here's my mistake; when I explained to you that they have less than half the population of the Netherlands and yet maintain a military roughly the same size as ours... I thought it would be *obvious* to you that they're doing much better than us by capita.

They have more soldiers relative to their population than we do. They also outspend us as a percentage of GDP spent on the military.

So... I have no idea why you keep dissing on them.

&gt; Small countries of the west out pace them at in army

Again, Bulgaria has less than half the population of the Netherlands. 7 million people versus almost 18 million. If we had as many people relative to our population in the military as they did, we'd have an army of like a 102K. So clearly, we're not coming out all that well in the comparison in terms of who'se doing more than who. 

And of course Bulgaria's efforts are even more impressive when you consider that Dutch GDP is approaching a trillion dollars. The Dutch economy is literally 14 times the size of Bulgaria.

I'm not even sure what that means anymore other than the rainbow flag. But as far I as I can understand, people are saying it's important that people should be taught that not everyone is heterosexual. Which is like kicking in an open door, because I thought people already knew that. But that needs to be learned at school and this guy doesn't want that. But let's say we do teach it at schools, shouldn't we include other groups as well? Such as disabled people and asexual people? They kinda get ignored by the pride-people and the non-pride-people. Why isn't that a problem? Even in a non-sexual context, disabled people are often being left behind. But I don't hear anyone demanding that every building should work for them.

841,"&gt; I disagree. I think a common military would do a lot t create a common foreign policy.

You design and implement a military around a foreign policy and then utilize it to advice those foreign policy goals.

You don't just say ""okay, let's get some tanks, some artillery, a sub or two and then see what we can do with them"".

Some of the decisions take quite some years.

Like, when the US decides to build warships and decides that it needs N carrier groups and what the range of those aircraft are and what landing craft are used it has as an input what countries it expects to be able to fight.  It needs to know how quickly it must be able to reinforce forces abroad.  It has to know what guarantees or alliances it may need to extend.  It has to anticipate how its relations may change.

Like, you don't say ""mandatory military service sounds cool — let's do that"".  You do that if you're concerned that your country might be invaded with little warning, so you need to slash training time.  To know whether that's important, you have to have a list of countries you expect to be on the defensive against and who they might be acting in conjunction with and their capabilities.

Establishing the goals that the military will achieve has to come first just to know how to structure it.

And then when you act, if you have one military, then the parts depend on each other.  It cannot operate well — maybe at all — if individual members don't want to bring their forces.  If the bombers show up, but the tankers to fuel them don't, there's an issue.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/odsr00/support_for_a_common_army_across_eu_members/h4512xn/,duisThias,1625500684

I'm not an expert, but I do know a fair bit about this subject, and I think the point you're making is that it really is just straight up too late to reverse course on most of these plants now. If the decisions had been made earlier to allow a reversal of policy, it'd be a different conversation, because the utilities would've been investing in those plants' futures incrementally, over time. To save them now would require them being offline for years and spending hundreds of millions and that's just not going to happen. The cost-benefit doesn't work for them. I get that.

I guess the issue is that I'm approaching it from a purely philosophical point of view. Okay, realistically, it's done. It's already over. There's no U-turn possible now.

Demisexual people don't get aroused by porn. That's like the whole point.

&gt; And can you now answer my question? So demisexual people are ""members of the lgbtq"" is they say they are demisexual but not if they don't say they are demisexual?

It's like with every potential member of the LGBTQIA+ community. I didn't knew I was trans for like 22 years as such I didn't see myself as part of LGTBQIA+. But was I still a part of it, even though I didn't thought such? Are we allowed to say ""they are a member of LGBTQIA+"", even though they themselves don't think so?

In the end I would lean to no, but I don't think there's the one answer. What's more important is: Demisexual is an LGBTQIA+ issue, and we fight for it. 

P.S.: In the statistics I and others quote regarding the numbers, it's about self-identification. So there the answer would be ""no, it's not part if they don't say it is""",,/r/europe/comments/oe2nf7/croatian_most_politician_on_lgbt_people_they_need/h44cxgc/,gansgar,1625486240

1079,"&gt;Well they are madeup but humans collectivly agreed upon them and most ofthem serve some purpose while you being called a madeup gender doesn't.

Just because you say so doesn't mean it's somehow suddenly true lol. You may not like it but humans have also collectively agreed to what gender identity is, and on top of that it has scientific, medical and psychological support behind it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No but I am using my gender based on my apperance and my hormones, and not having chromosone disorder that I know of.

Okay so please tell me how this is different from trans people? Because from what you're describing it sounds like you'd agree that there's no difference.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And my gender is agree on by everyone and by science.

Aside from the fact that nobody is ""agreeing on"" your gender (what does that even mean), trans people's gender identity is *also* supported by medical and psychological evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yeah but you can force a man out of the womans bathroom when ever youwant or call some type of authoroty if he doesnt want to. By acceptingthat a man is a woman you cant really do that.

Since forever governments in all countries that uses energy have been working to ensure the energy supply.

If the only case of this you ever heard about is Nordstream, that's crazy. There's been wars over energy and oil and gas for 80 years lol.

&gt;When Trump decided to sanction those companies, Germany acted like it was attack on their own independence.

Off course the German government reacts when German companies are attacked?

IDK what you think here. That a government can only act to protect ITSELF, so if a government wants to help a company, then the company is part of the government?

Governments off course help the companies in the country. It doesn't mean they condone everything they do. Governments routinely get angry at companies lol. Happens ALL THE TIME.

The Danish government can both help Lego at times, and at other times they do stuff Lego doesn't like. 

&gt;Sure. With Germany.

Yes. That's their policy?

They also thinks it works for the EU though. They'd like that all the EU countries traded with China and Russia, because they think it would make it less likely that China and Russia messed with those countries.

I think it's a big problem that so few people even understand German policy.

1102,"&gt;I'm saying measures should be taken, both preventive and repressive, to ensure that those thoughts don't translate to actions.

No. Unless the thought is deterministic of action (no thoughts are), it is inherently unjust to criminalise it in any way. We do not criminalise people based on probability. It goes directly against the presumption of innocence. You are repressing innocent people.

Let's take a look through your list:

&gt;Banning conversion therapy

Not a hill I want to die on. However, if you're letting people mutilate their bodies with SRS, they should be free to pursue conversion therapy if they wish to.

&gt;Educating in same sex relationships

In proportion to homosexual population (*at most* 5%), meaning 5% of the teaching on relationships should be covering homosexuality.

&gt;Either marriage equality or a registered partnership where registered partnerships have the exact same rights as a marriage.

Fine with this. Civil partnerships are imo the answer.

&gt;Equality in blood donation.

Blood testing solves this issue.

&gt;Hate crime and hate speech laws

Hard disagree. Assault, stalking, incitement to violence, etc. are already crimes - making it extra illegal based on sexual orientation is discriminatory.

Then I'd spend the Friday doing household chores to clear the way for my husband and I to enjoy the weekend. 

I'm introverted so I loved my quiet Fridays - just me with BBC Radio 4 on in the background. I didn't have to see anyone and I felt re-invigorated having time to myself to get things done at home.

I changed to a different job working two and a half days when we had children. That has proved to be, for me, a good balance for juggling highly technical work with a busy family.

If you say that you are tolerant, but spread slurs all day, are you actually tolerant, or do you just not care about how you affect them?

The moment you do care, enough to listen when people say ""do not do that"", then you are changing how you behave personally to accommodate others.

To be truly respectful and tolerant of people does mean listening to them, understanding what affects them.

So to try to create a version of tolerance that has no affect on your behaviour, or what people in society learn, is to make tolerance into a meaningless word. Of course, we tolerate these people, but social consensus says we must drive them from their homes, we tolerate them, but we don't have to give them jobs equally without discrimination..

With the terrorism issue this really risks putting the EU as a whole into Middle Eastern wars.
And then Eastern Europe, you never really know who their leaders are faithful to. And they still have too much potential conflict right at their doorstep.
And Northern Ireland, if this becomes more violent, if the EU was sent in to help the Irish then it becomes a UK against EU thing which I really don’t want to escalate.

When it comes to organization, the airforces can be easily integrated. They already work together anyway and use the same communications. The same applies to the navy.

I would keep one language per ship or base and one unifying language for the officers, preferably not English, German or French, but a politically neutral language. The French Foreign Legion is able to ram French into their heads in a few months, so this is not unrealistic. 

The infantry regiments should also be split according to language. There's no need to expect every soldier to be multilingual, but it would be required for the officers and warrant officers.

1474,"I'd go *slightly* weaker and say that it's probably not practical to have a single military unless there's a single foreign policy, because the military's capabilities depend upon that foreign policy (does one need infantry, surface-to-air missiles, or aircraft carriers?  Depends on what foreign policy goals one intends to achieve with this military), and one needs to have the ability to use the military as a unit, not ""13 out of 27 states decided to bring their resources for *this* particular conflict"".  In theory, I could imagine a confederation that has a single foreign policy and military.

Though, honestly, I'd say that all of this stuff is probably a ton easier if the EU just does what you propose -- federalizes.  Cleans up all the remaining issues in one fell swoop (adds fiscal transfers, a common budget, a foreign policy, a military, a constitution, etc).

1485,"In May 1946, Parisian fashion designer Jacques Heim released a two-piece swimsuit design that he named the Atome ('Atom') and advertised as ""the smallest swimsuit in the world"". Like swimsuits of the era, it covered the wearer's navel, and it failed to attract much attention.

Clothing designer Louis Réard introduced his new, smaller design in July. He named the swimsuit after the Bikini Atoll, where the first public test of a nuclear bomb had taken place only four days before. 

His skimpy design was risqué, exposing the wearer's navel and much of her buttocks. No runway model would wear it, so he hired a nude dancer from the Casino de Paris named Micheline Bernardini to model it at a review of swimsuit fashions.

Due to its revealing design, the bikini was considered controversial, facing opposition from a number of groups and being accepted only very slowly by the general public. In many countries, the design was banned from beaches and other public places: in 1949, France banned the bikini from being worn on its coastlines; Germany banned the bikini from public swimming pools until the 1970s, and some communist groups condemned the bikini as a ""capitalist decadence"".",Romania,/r/europe/comments/oe00w0/5_july_1946_named_after_bikini_atoll_the_site_of/h43ji9n/,capcaunul,1625460761

1645,"Agree it’s idiotic to close functioning plants. Also see no insurmountable problems with modern nuclear, especially in terms of crisis, which we are in.

However, it’s important to be aware that massive expansion of nuclear *in reasonable time* in Europe is a complete pipe dream. There’s just too complex political landscape, nimbyism and the current tech takes AGES to build. 

Finland is running on **20 years** for their new reactor, and the UK Hinkley point is also above budget and behind schedule. 

Europe has some 300 coal power plants. Let’s just pretend 100 new nuclear plants could replace them.. You need to climb financial, political, industrial and NIMBYISM hurdles to make this real. When you finally start saving some CO2 from new operating plants, wind/solar will have made up the difference way faster. 

So, if you try to maximize gain, it’s likely your investment will pay off sooner going for wind/solar + energy saving measures rather than nuclear.
 
Long term, sure. But it makes sense to divert resources to wind/solar until it has been somewhat saturated. (Yes I’m aware of base load.) 

The very best would probably to regulate these investments for cooperation/planning between nations (grids etc) and have some technical body with a clear mandate and goals make the calls. 

So for now, at least my opinion is to be a little wary of the reddit Nuclear fandom. Sounds good, but unrealistic in the democratic world. (Dictatorships can pull it off easy)",,/r/europe/comments/odnk1l/germany_to_brussels_nuclear_power_must_not_be/h42tyxr/,Ninja_Thomek,1625443826

I have no problem with nuclear. It’s safe, the waste can largely be burned off in the future, and proliferation of nuclear weapons is hardly an issue in Europe. 

Problems abound however:

* Super expensive investment phase (Recoups in 20-30 years)

* NIMBYISM (Can be solved in authoritarian countries) 

* Takes forever to build  

* Politically challenging. Greens are getting stronger and stronger, and many of the parties have their origin stories in anti-nuclear.

* Industrially challenging (reactors require extreme heavy industries only available a few places. It’s pretty rad when they make reactor vessels though.) 

As long as wind/solar is not exhausted it’s likely to deliver power faster, cheaper, and keep doing so while the nuclear plants are getting built. (20 years nowadays, perhaps we could get it down to 15?)

We do need solutions for base load however, but this can partly be carried out by better grids across Europe.

1738,"&gt;Are you aware that energy mix based on wind and solar is not sustainable without massive energy storage solutions, which are mostly uneconomical, environmentally unfriendly and/or unsustainable?

Nuclear power also need flexible supplementation, and if we are to decarbonize all our energy uses, it's also going to need storage. That's unavoidable, regardless what we use as bulk power. So we can't avoid that by using nuclear power. 

The only reason energy storage was uneconomical is that we used fossil fuels as storaged energy. But that is changing fast. There's also no reason to use environmentally unfriendly storage solutions. If you point at batteries, those will be used still with nuclear power just as well, as they are optimized for mobile use in vehicles and electronics of all kinds. Grid storage will not use batteries.

&gt; but modern fast neutron rector solutions are able to burn most of the nuclear waste into usable energy.

If you don't mind that they leak and burn molten salt, so they have to be patched up pretty much constantly.

&gt;You don't need to go all-nuclear, but solid stable energy generation baseline provided by nuclear power is actually very reasonable solution.

Baseload is an outdated concept. It's from a time when the only thing we had was big cheap thermal plants and expensive peaker plants. In that case it makes sense to use as much of the stable plants as you can (i.e. the baseload), and use peakers for the rest. But now we have a third option, even cheaper variable plants. So we're not longer tied to the traditional baseload + peaker approach, we can also use variable + peaker now.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/odnk1l/germany_to_brussels_nuclear_power_must_not_be/h42ggju/,silverionmox,1625436098

I think we need to look further in the future for such a question. 20 years ago a good chunk of Germany was defacto controlled by the Soviet Union and until 2016 the USA was considered to be more or less a stable ally (even though Obama had already started the “pivot to Asia”). 

Divergences between the US and EU are relatively new but now seem to be trending towards widening. There’s a lot of politics involved of course and especially in Germany subjects in relation to the military are always very touchy. 

I don’t think anyone who follows these things should expect anything concrete for at least 20/30 years.

1792,"Could work, keep in mind the only true union of Europe happened during the Roman Empire, everything else was a farce, and most people dont know this but the roman legion was a pretty multinational force. How did they achieve this? Very simple, they had a common language. We don't, and this is why Europe can't be united and the EU is a way too ambitious but pretty badly planned out project that is not that it seems to be. Yes I would want a united europe too, who doesn't, but just not the current paradigm. This what we have today is not uniting at all, there is no unity here, there are just chickens roaming around pretenting that the other one is the fox.

-

Also keep in mind that while in Rome latin was the official and de facto language for communications, there was also a linquistical relaxation at border provinces, so the language actually did evolve and borrowed from other cultures nearby, even ones they considered barbarians. Isn't this pathetic how today we don't have nearly the international cooperation. Like how the hell can you even call the EU an European project when we barely have any international cooperation and actual ways to interact with foreigners. Ah the Schenghen might be a good start, except that we will never get into that. What else? Not much, aside from a few sports and cultural festivals, it's still pretty impoverished and nonexistant. There is simply just not the level of freedom and internationalism that one would expect from such a large continental project. So yeah,before we go for federalism, you might want to promote more international cooperation betwen the peoples to familiarize themselves with what they want.

1811,"&gt; Probably make a new term that also evokes the region and then popularize that. Had the PDO effort consisted of the EU simply registering US trademarks for, say, ""ChampagneFromChampagne"", there would have been no dispute.

There's is no dispute now either. Producers that called their products ""champagne"" before, had their rights grandfathered into the new agreement. That's why Kobel for example can sell California Champagne.

And frankly nowadays, it's only people who are making a subpar product, who even wants adorn themselves with borrowed feathers, by calling their product ""champagne"". 

If the thing you are making is worth shit, chances are you would want to highlight your own region, instead of making people think your product came from a border region to Belgium. 

Just like if you were making actually good sneakers yourself, you wouldn't try to sell them as Nike, Reebok or Adidas. You'd proudly put your own name on it.

&gt;the US has similarly stripped exclusivity from US mark holders. For example, a US company trademarked ""Trampoline"", but did not enforce its trademark and require others to use a separate, generic term until after the term ""trampoline"" had entered generic use, so now anyone can make and sell trampolines under that name.

1840,"&gt;This is just self-deception. Scottish people want out of the union

The only self deception going on is your inability to realise that Scottish people, on a whole, are deeply divided on this issue and they're not all clamouring for independence as much as you, an Irish person who wants to see England fail in everything it does, would love to witness. 

&gt;and that's why they're voting for an independence party. Failure to acknowledge this will lead the UK past the tipping point.

They've voting for the SNP for a myriad of reasons, not all of them have to do with independence. 

&gt;I appreciate the explanation but I don't find that rationale convincing. I'm sure a couple of voters switched from a union party to an independence party because they felt that their policies were more progressive but this is difficult to measure and likely a minority point of view.

Support for independence in 2011 was 35%, it was even lower in 2007 when the SNP became the government for the first time, the SNP got support because they were Labour without being, at the time, Blairs Labour, the nationalist message was ramped up only later when they got into government and eventually got a majority in 2011, but the SNP didn't wipe Labour out until 2015. 

&gt;The problem is that the larger country completely dominates the UK. Compare that to the US or EU where smaller entities get proportionally more representation, not solely based on population size. 

Nope, the South East of the UK completely dominates the UK. The issue of devolution isn't solely relegated to that of Scotland and Wales. 

&gt;They were purged in 2019 . 

Wrong, not every person in the Conservative party who is pro Union is a remainer, lol. 

&gt;The rump Tory party back Johnson in reducing devolved powers and centralising administration. This is part of the post-Brexit agenda where the UK has to present a completely united front outside of Europe.

That's not being anti Unionist, that's just their version of a highly centralised version of Unionism. 

&gt;A complete rethink of the union is required but I don't see a path to that at the moment.

That's because you live in a foreign country traditionally hostile to England, so I can see why such things would could your judgement. 

&gt;This process is already underway with the ratification of the Internal Markets Bill.

No it's not, because you're basing it on a proposition that this bill will never be amended in the future. 

&gt;And they haven't been able to do a single thing about their spending powers being removed under the removed under the Internal Markets Bill. This is only the start. Like in Hong Kong, any dissent will take place outside the toothless local government.

Rubbish, that's predicated on the Conservative party ruiling without a break in perpetuity and their spending powers haven't been removed, they're not getting the spending powers which were in context of the EU powers which were delegated by Westminster to Brussells back. 

&gt;What's extraordinary is that they weren't given a hearing.

[US states aren't obligated to a hearing either.](https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-new-hampshire-massachusetts-health-coronavirus-pandemic-3949fa5875db4486f25a514b21aa5988)

&gt;The government of 1981 was more trustworthy in terms of obeying international treaties and punishing corruption. 

[Wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery_Act_2010)

&gt;Probably not as strong on human rights. I don't think the authoritarian nature of the conservative party has changed at all.

Authoritarianism changes to more effective measures, if they weren't so strong on Human rights they would never have obligated themselves to allowing potentially hundreds of thousands of HK'gers to come to the UK. 

&gt;How is that circular? Do you mean that it can't be objectively evaluated? Not collecting data on ethnicity would be a good start.

Because for you any amount of census data collection is bad because of some hypothetical down the line. 

&gt;How is that a conspiracy? Asked some of the thousands of British subjects alive today who were interned without due process.

Because it was in the middle of a massive counterinsurgency operation in NI over 40 years ago and which the British army disavowed when they realised after analysing the consequences of those actions that it was completely counterproductive to winning over the population, when that happens in GB, let me know thanks. 

&gt;That's a very complacent thing to say. Do you feel that the media and politicians are serving people well at the moment?

Nope, but they're not complacent, they're acting incompetently. 

&gt;It was just renamed and some Scottish MPs were added, they didn't even bother changing the name of the Bank of England.

The Bank of Scotland still exists as a private entity and has done so since 1695, besides that, perhaps we're not as hung up on the naming of such institutions considering Scotlands bank had one of the founders be an Englishman. 

&gt;That's just a euphemism for Westminister taking powers away from devolved governments.

No it's not, Devolution in GB is barely 20 years old, constitutional arrangements redefining of how the UK is governed and the relationships of all the nation on the island isn't all going to be sorted out from the get go. 

&gt;You're aware of this process but not worried because you're English and the devolved governments are unimportant to you.

Ah the good old Irish response, if it's not 100% utopian in application, somehow my Englishness is to blame for it not being perfect, lol. 

&gt;It would only be close if the referendum required a super majority, which doesn't seem to be the UK style.

Except in 1979 when the SNP lost a vote on a devolved parliament by a vote which required a super majority. 

&gt;It germinated, was funded, organised and shut down from France.

By people who were British, the French weren't responsible for creating the movement. 

&gt;Nevertheless, now they have.

But they didn't over 12 days ago, so that's irrelevant. 

&gt;It means that the Northern Ireland Protocol is staying in place and will be enforced. 

I expect in the future it to be watered down and made palatable to both Unionists and Nationalists, it won't exist in its current form 5 years from now.

The US came to an earlier agreement specifically for champagne — one which grandfathered all existing US producers — in an earlier arrangement, but refused the EU on the PDO system in general, which was part of the TTIP discussions.  I'm explaining why it did so.

&gt; And frankly nowadays, it's only people who are making a subpar product, who even wants adorn themselves with borrowed feathers, by calling their product ""champagne"". 

Nope.  It costs money to build awareness of a term and product.  They'd already committed to a product in a class known as champagne.  If you were correct, the US would object to trademarks from EU entities in general.

1873,"It doesn't sound like you are hateful towards intersex people. I think our stances are pretty close - the only difference I can see is that you think being intersex is a disability. It's not, intersex people are perfectly fine, they don't need treatment, they just don't fit into the boxes male or female. Here's an article from Amnesty about Intersex people. Myth 3 has a link to an extensive report about what it means to be intersex, but it's a long read so I don't expect you to read it.

[https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/10/its-intersex-awareness-day-here-are-5-myths-we-need-to-shatter/](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/10/its-intersex-awareness-day-here-are-5-myths-we-need-to-shatter/) 

I also agree with you that most people are either male or female. However, with that small percentage of people not fitting into those two boxes, the proper term would be ""bimodal"". That doesn't mean that the two binaries should be the norm though. Even though intersex/non binary people make up a smaller percentage of people, that still means their gender is perfectly valid. Here's an interesting article on the gender spectrum, and why gender is actually bimodal instead of binary:

[https://cadehildreth.com/gender-spectrum/](https://cadehildreth.com/gender-spectrum/)

Lastly, with our - mostly - agreement on intersex people, can we add the mental counterpart to the discussion? While intersex physically have both male and female characteristics, non binary people mentally have both male and female characteristics. I hope you now see that gender isn't just about male or female, even when most people do fall into those categories.",,/r/europe/comments/odhhyr/imposing_imaginary_values_risks_eu_collapse/h422zhj/,callmemrgoat,1625429163

Factually wrong

&gt; Evo Morales took himself down by provoking a constitutional crisis.

The 2017 Supreme Constitutional Tribunal ruling has nothing to do with the OAS election fraud allegations of the 2019 election...

&gt; They want to keep their trade. Not foreign trade. China nationalistic Han fervour, wolf warrior diplomacy and the happening in Xinjiang is enough to show to everyone how much they care for other nations, and people. I don't trust China when it comes to keeping free trade a thing. Even if it's detrimental to them they will try to control it because that's what authoritarian hegemonic nationalistic government do.

You argue like a spam email throwing buzzwords. You understand that it makes 0 sense for China to damage their own trade and you still block yourself with nonsense.

&gt; The market will react with the help of government like always and TSMC in Taiwan won't be a strategic industry anymore. And the US will continue to defend Taiwan. 

History says otherwise, nothing more to say besides ""we will see""

&gt; And the US is not the only one that want to see those laboratories in Wuhan. the EU wants too.

Makes sense. Counter-attacks are powerful, lots of video games have a mechanic like that.

It also plays into the concept of ""over-extension"". If you over-extend you make yourself vulnerable and can be easily staggered or cut-off. So I guess in your view the right-wing over-extended itself with idiocy and now... suffers for it.

My comment is obviously not specifically about this specific paper being funded but rather the wider ‘woke culture’ (though I cringe to use that term tbh) which although it seems to split society about 50/50 nevertheless receives support, tacit approval and often funding from elite society and government in the west. 

This toolkit of ideas, whether it’s trans movements, ‘white’-related studies (which doesn’t even make sense in Europe), colonial obsession, etc is just so far removed from the ‘western values’ which people outside the west were sold as actual ‘western values’ back in the 90’s and early 00’s like rule of law, freedom of speech, social capitalism etc. 

Cultural memories always lag behind a decade or two in people’s head compared to facts on the ground - and the west just moves so wildly these last few years that I am amazed at the amazement of the elites at any pushback, especially when it comes from semi-westerners like Hungarians and not Arabs or Africans who aren’t reaaaaly expected to get with the program.",,/r/europe/comments/odhhyr/imposing_imaginary_values_risks_eu_collapse/h419yhq/,Alexander241020,1625414815

2181,"Unfortunately, while I get your thinking, your presumption is wrong. The EU strongly hoped for a democratic Eastern Europe when allowing them to join the Union in 2004, since they have all met the accession criteria for 4 years straight.

However, we can now see that it is not so easy to exert political and cultural influence within any country, even if they are inside the EU. Poland is simply undemocratic but Hungary is eating and dismantling the Union from the inside. They are allowing Russian and Chinese state owned banks and investments to gain foothold and spread their own influence to neighbouring countries, such as Slovenia.

One common critique of the EU is that it is too weak and cannot exert enough power over its own memebers states. Wheter you'd like it to be able to do so or not is irrelevant right now, what matters is that the critique is correct.

The EU as it is right now can barely defend itself within its own borders. Individual memeber states rarely turn on one another and the unanimity rule makes it impossible to follow the rule of majority, wheter we want to or not. In turn however, it is actually much stronger when it comes to dealing with external threats and influences.

Russia and China are playing the long game where they infiltrate the EU and disrupt it form the inside. It is actually much harder to do so from the outside.

So it is much more in favour of the EU and its citizens to not allow undemocratic and corrupt countries entry into the Union.

Regarding New Zealand, their culture is much closer to the EU than that of the Balkans as sad as that is. Culture doesn't stop at geographical borders. Culture includes morals, values, ethics. New Zealand is much more like a Northern European country than any Balkan state. As of now, those countries are not compatible with the EU.

In that context communautarism is extremly dangerous.

But such an extrication doesn’t happen overnight. It requires complex planning, specifically in this case to deter any possible Russian military moves into Belarus, as in Moscow’s seizure of Crimea from Ukraine or its creation of other “frozen conflicts” on Russia’s periphery. One potential bargaining chip: Putin’s prized Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany still isn’t complete, and it can be stopped at will, assuming the West and Germany in particular still have one”

Occitan was spoken by around 1/3 of the French population as late as WW1. There were actually significant problems mobilizing and directing French troops as oftentimes the soldiers couldn't understand one another. Are you really trying to claim that Frenchmen fighting under the same flag a century ago somehow had different religions and values?

See, this is why Macron has to double down on ""identity politics"", because France has ruthlessly wiped out the diversity of it's native cultures. Britanny, Basque Country, Nord Catalunya, Corsica... These regions had and have identities that are Fench but distinct from the homogenized French identity which has been aggressively pressed upon them. 

This isn't like the Reconquista of Spain from the Moors, they don't have different religions and values and this didn't happen centuries ago. Even in the 21st century, French leaders have actively declared their opposition to any official recognition of regional languages.

2678,"that's what interbreeding means, but yeah they did push the celtic population back towards the west of the country and became the dominant people in most of the south and middle. during this time, the Anglo Saxon language also came out as the dominant language until the Vikings came, where old danish/norse was the language spoken in the danelaw areas amongst the elite and old Anglican amongst the lower classes. old English was most likely a result of the mixing of the two over the 300 or so years that the Viking age lasted. 

but a lot of mixing took place for sure. 

the same happened when the Danish tribe took over mainland Denmark from the Anglo Saxons and frisians and so on. them coming in may have played a part in pushing the Anglo-Saxon population toward the south and west, as well as towards the British isles, as them pushing west happened around the same time during the 300s and on. but mixing took place here also. 
the retreat of the Romans also gave a ton of room for the germanic people to expand further south from Scandinavia and begin to mix with the primarily Celtic tribes of Central northern Europe, especially the German speaking countries of today. 

that said, there has been so much mixing with the French as well as the Irish and so on during the middle ages, that the English has become its very own distinct thing now yes. 

the same goes for the language, that got heavily influenced by the French after the end of the Viking age, when they became the main sparring partner for the English",,/r/europe/comments/od66k0/semifinals_euro_2020/h3zqm8f/,aknutal,1625373516

3049,"&gt;The main two problems here that you are missing out of, is that firstly Norway does not trade the same way the rest of the EU does, we have an instinct fishing industry which has been built up after decades of Norwegian salmon advocation. EU would not only help destroy what we have independently built, but make our products less unique. And joining the EU, as I mentioned previously will let other European companies take our fish from us and degrade our second-biggest national resource. This has been tied with our oil industry as our biggest obstacle for joining the EU, regarding fish it's the same with Iceland.

How would the EU destroy our industry, and how would they steal our fish? You even mention the main component of our fish export, salmon. Salmon is farmed. How will the EU take that? If they could farm salmon in Spain or Romania, they would of course have done it by now. They do however take a lot of our salmon and profit from it because it is much cheaper to process the salmon for retail sale in the EU because of high toll barriers on processed fish. That is  the reason why Poland is our largest export market in the World. They process it.

Economically it makes a whole lot of sense to join for our fisheries industry. We have a product that the EU really wants. That product is found mostly in Norwegian waters, and even more importantly, in fish farms. So of course, easier access and fewer tolls would mean higher exports and more money. The icing on the cake is that more jobs would be created in processing since it would be cheaper to do it in Norway. 

I know concern for our fish was a main reason for our no to EU, but it was a mistake for the industry, and the no would make even less sense now in 2021 when fish farming dominates and EU fishery regulations are more aligned with ours. 

&gt;Secondly as an EEA member we already have access to the single market, so statements you have made like ""cheaper food, more variety, cheaper alcohol"" are wrong. Because, we already have access, we are already profiting on that membership. Joining the EU would just be inconvenient for now, because are farmers, fishing &amp; oil industry would be damaged with no real benefit.

No, they aren’t wrong since we are not a part of the toll union, and the trade in agricultural products is not a part of the EEA. With membership we would join the toll union and toll barriers would be removed. So our supermarkets could then import more and cheaper from the EU, bringing our food prices down and giving us more variety. Alcohol would be much cheaper because unless we lower alcohol taxes there would be a rush to the border. Today you can bring a limited quota of alcohol from the EU, but with membership you could fill up you car because of the toll union. 

And as mentioned, the fish industry would gain, the oil industry wouldn’t really notice a difference, but the farmers would struggle. 

&gt;I can promise you, as of 2021 there is no real benefit for us to join. All benefits would come in 15-20 years at minimum. We are talking the best or second best independence story in all of Europe, maybe behind Switzerland. Why damage that, which we have built for no benefit as of now. I am pro EU advocate, however we are in no rush, seeing as joining the EU will in the foreseeable future.

The main benefit would be immediate, and that would be a seat at the table an actual influence on the rules and regulations that we have to implement anyway. Economically we would benefit as well, but as mentioned, farmers and people like Olaf Thon would suffer.",Norway,/r/europe/comments/oasyjm/sweden_and_norway_referendums_for_eu_membership/h3yb7h2/,Kjottkaka,1625342626

 &gt;Donar's Oak (also Thor's Oak or, via interpretatio romana, Jove's Oak) was a sacred tree of the Germanic pagans located in an unclear location around what is now the region of Hesse, Germany. According to the 8th century Vita Bonifatii auctore Willibaldi, the Anglo-Saxon missionary Saint Boniface and his retinue cut down the tree earlier the same century. Wood from the oak was then reportedly used to build a church at the site dedicated to Saint Peter. Sacred trees and sacred groves were widely venerated by the Germanic peoples.

- I don't criticise USA, I sympathize. One of the most advanced things come from there and yet so much inequality and is not that you don't have money, you do.(if you're American). USA pays twice as much money on healthcare per person than UK and is far less effective. So, you do have the money, even more than maybe the best healthcare system in the world, you just use it poorly. USA needs regulation, needs maternal leave, paid sick leave not sick days, needs affordable education so it can be the fucking great country has the potential to be. So many good things in healthcare come from America, is astonishing, you just need more regulation, there only so much an ambulance ride is worth or a insulin etc etc.

I'm not sure that the deal as it stands works within an EU context in the way it does between countries outside of the EU.

 &gt;The French people (French: Français) are an ethnic group primarily located in Western Europe and nation that shares a common French culture, history, the French language and is identified with the country of France.
 
**[French_nationality_law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_nationality_law)** 
 
 &gt;French nationality law is historically based on the principles of jus soli (Latin for ""right of soil"") and jus sanguinis, according to Ernest Renan's definition, in opposition to the German definition of nationality, jus sanguinis  (Latin for ""right of blood""), formalised by Johann Gottlieb Fichte. The 1993 Méhaignerie Law, which was part of a broader immigration control agenda to restrict access to French nationality and increase the focus on jus sanguinis as the citizenship determinant for children born in France, required children born in France of foreign parents to request French nationality at adulthood, rather than being automatically accorded citizenship.

 [Aftermath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Königgrätz#Aftermath) 
 
 &gt;Königgrätz was the decisive battle of the Austro-Prussian War. The Prussians then continued to pursue the defeated Austrian Nord-Armee and fought a series of minor clashes, with the last skirmish being fought at Blumenau on July 22, just as the Peace of Prague to put a halt to the fighting was being signed. It provided a great opportunity for Prussian statesmen, by clearing a path toward German unification, in particular with the Little Germany (Germany without Austria) solution, with the subsequent foundation of the North German Confederation. The outcome also ensured that Prussia would have a free hand when a war with France came to pass in 1871.

3550,"&gt;You are literally raising one topic because you think the original one isn't important.

The topic is American issues and sentiments imported into Europe and why we don't want that.

&gt;And we have police violence against blacks in Germany and France

So.. what? Your police is not the same as our police, and it is not the same as American police, so what sort of sense does it make to then import a movement against American police brutality into Germany? Or any other European country?

Not to mention, you seem to operate entirely on the assumption that I don't care about racism against black people, or that I don't care about racism against black people in America.

&gt;Notice how I don't use insults here but try to have you understand?

Yet you fail to notice how you've kept asking me different versions of the same question, that I have kept answering without insult. Until I called you dense, but what the fuck do you expect when I keep explaining the same thing over and over again?

BLM is an American issue, no more, no less. It doesn't do to use an exclusively American movement to combat your own issues, in fact, it's weak. And to then ask ""what about our own, related, but different problems"" is not whataboutism. Whataboutism is entirely about deflecting blame *from yourself to someone else*, which.. again, is the complete opposite I'm doing.

If after all this, you *still* want to act like you don't understand, then I can't help you. I can't help someone who thinks they need American social movements to combat their own issues, and I can't help someone who wants to put American social issues above their own. And I certainly won't stand for being accused of not caring about black people because I care more about racism against Muslims in a country where I'm pretty sure there are more Muslims than black people. 

But if you really need it spelled out, all racism is obviously fucking bad. Duh. Fucking duh.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/obuzu9/macron_blames_imported_us_ideas_for_france/h3wmxbj/,Grenyn,1625306481

3588,"Tier 1 suppliers aren't (yet?) impacted by this, i have zero visibility in them other than the fact that the smaller ones are being 'convinced' into generally improving their processes through workshops with the OEM on site and the like.

Bigger ones for now prefer to foot the bill for non-compliances; an example is brake producers, Bosch, etc. They are too big to bend down to any OEM at the moment. 

However, what i can say without going into specific detail, is that OEMs are pursuing the path of automation strongly.

I can't say that specific job cuts will be done - but after you're saving the company thousands of work hours, i don't see any other path. 

&gt;  I can't imagine that the number of ''the office worker, that takes excel files and outputs dubious info'' is nearly that high

You'd be surprised. Most OEM's are divided into separate entities, production, design, logistics, sales, etc. 

Most of these entities have office workers that 'handle the beans'. 

Those are at the highest risk, as most of the stuff can be done in UIPath with little effort.

There was a project in the past in which people were being 'shadowed' by automation engineers for a day, then phased out.

The more robust a process is, the more structured it is, the easier it can be automated.

Humans come into processes to handle 'disturbances', abnormalities and in general 'stuff that was not predicted'.

If you put someone skilled enough for a week to analyze a process; with nowadays capabilities it could be automated in a month.

By Soviets

&gt;Million? Why not 10 millions? :)

Couldn't find more? Lack of infrastructure? Inability to plan and execute? Stalin was a moron? Pick one.

Yes very funny, relocate entire villages, force people to live there and joke that they are still there. Wonder, if you were relocated 1000s km away from your home, how easily would you go back. Oddly enough you gave yourself a number. Like if 400k people deported from their homes were not horrid enough. 

&gt;Source of info?

Arktikum / Rovaniemi 

&gt;If it's western (mostly US pushed) narrative then it's all pretty much the same.

Haha, you are so funny when you just can not accept the fact that your country (I assume) was the bad one. Were your grandpa there? Was he pulling the trigger and that's why you can not accept it? Btw I got my education in communist school in one of the satellite states. We were regularly brainwashed by the Americans there. 

&gt;If you haven't heard of counteractions to swedish language - yes, you do.

Dude you told that Finns were not talking Finnish pre Russia. Do you know any Finns? Have you been to Finland?

&gt;Sounds good, by your logic any state in any given moment has right to invade neighbours to get their maximal historical borders? :)

So how do the states regain independence? 

&gt;Why do you ask? If you are so sure - just deliver yours.
I did. I gave you wiki link (dismissed american propaganda), name of Russian historian that made a list of the murderers (dismissed), told you that Gorbatshov apologized for it (dismissed cause Yeltzin was drunk). Now you want to study videos of exhumations ... ok so you watched videos from Karelian camps and counted the bodies yourself?

&gt; Yes, finns were.

Like, the Russian state could clone the existing Russian-language Wikipedia, set it up on a server in Russia (""Russopedia?""), block regular Wikipedia, and then require registered users or something and have policies that prohibit content that clashes with the state's narrative.  But end of the day, I think that countries have to decide between connectivity and blocking political ideas that they find unacceptable.  Connectivity means that it's easier to collaborate and pick up information, but also means that there's gonna be exposure to political ideas that the leadership may not approve of.

Wikipedia's had a series of run-ins with governments who don't like this idea or that, but generally-speaking, governments seem to feel that access is more-valuable than restriction, and Wikipedia isn't too keen on restricting content.

It was released in 1976 and was the band's first album to attract attention outside Europe.[1] The title is described as being a reference to time as the killer of innocence.[2] The original cover featured a nude prepubescent girl, which stirred controversy in the UK, US and elsewhere. As a result, the album was re-issued with a different cover in some countries.

-

&gt;The US-based social conservative site WorldNetDaily reported the cover image on Wikipedia to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in May 2008 . A subsequent investigation by the FBI concluded that the artwork did not violate any US laws.[24] EContent magazine subsequently reported the Wikipedia community's internal debate: ""Prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the Virgin Killer cover will not be removed"" and asserted that Wikipedia contributors ""favour inclusion in all but the most extreme cases"".[25]
&gt;
&gt;The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a UK-based non-government organization added the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer to its internet blacklist due to concerns over legality of the image-- which had been assessed as the lowest level of legal concern: ""erotic posing with no sexual activity"".[26] As a result, people using many major UK ISPs were blocked from viewing the entire article by the Cleanfeed system.[26][27][28] A large part of the UK was blocked from editing Wikipedia. Following representations by the Wikimedia Foundation (which hosts the Wikipedia website)[29] and public complaints,[30] the IWF reversed their decision three days later and confirmed that in future they would not block copies of the image that were hosted overseas.[4] The IWF stated that one of the reasons for reversing their decision was that it had increased public interest in the image--an example of the Streisand effect.[31]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ocg9ij/putin_signs_law_that_bans_putting_ussr_nazi/h3w8imh/,duisThias,1625293012

3801,"**[Lebensraum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensraum)** 
 
 &gt;The German concept of Lebensraum (German pronunciation: [ˈleːbənsˌʁaʊm] (listen), ""living space"") comprises policies and practices of settler colonialism which proliferated in Germany from the 1890s to the 1940s. First popularized around 1901, Lebensraum became a geopolitical goal of Imperial Germany in World War I (1914–1918) originally, as the core element of the Septemberprogramm of territorial expansion. The most extreme form of this ideology was supported by the Nazi Party (NSDAP) and Nazi Germany until the end of World War II.

You might want to rephrase that. I know what you meant by it (Obama is not from part of the enslaved descendants in America), but someone might misunderstand it and point out that Kenya is in Africa. 


That aside, sure his dad got into Harvard and was privileged, but at the end of the day your average person in the streets wouldn't be able to tell Obama apart from any other black in America. If he ventured into the wrong place and ran into the wrong people, he would still get called a N*gger (half-arsed censor because reddit automatically removes comments with that word). In these situations what matters is how others perceive him, and he would be perceived as a Black man, so he still shares a common obstacle with the African-Americans.

&gt;you can no guess what propaganda I was brainwashed by.

Why should I worry propaganda from what country has brainwashed you? If it's western (mostly US pushed) narrative then it's all pretty much the same. 

&gt;Yup, cancer with a makeup.

Nice answer - liberal democracy talks are then ""cancer with a makeup"" too, thus anyone involved is ""equal to nazis"". By YOUR logic. 

&gt;Lol. Jesus. And you are the history expert and I know nothing.

If you haven't heard of counteractions to swedish language - yes, you do.

&gt;Poland regain independence and fight Russia to regain it's borders before partitions

Sounds good, by your logic any state in any given moment has right to invade neighbours to get their maximal historical borders? :)

&gt;And what kind of proof do you accept?

Why do you ask? If you are so sure - just deliver yours. 

Normally, if we talk about history - then we need what's called historical evidence. Read up on methodology. 

&gt; It was Soviet Union so Gorbatshov.

What Gorbatshov? 

Your evidence is your ability to write his second name or, maybe, some documents, some facts, expertises, photos? 

&amp;#x200B;

You list names but not a single piece of evidence. 20,000 bodies? Were they exhumated? Where can I study video of expertise done to them? As far as I know they weren't even all dug out - why do you think then there were 20,000 bodies?

If your only argument is that ""someone, somewhere said so"" and you haven't seen a single piece of material - than it's cleanest case of ""appealing to false authority"". 

Not the strongest base to initiate disputes, unless you are total moron.

&gt;Finns were nazi

What is nazi in this context? 

Pro-fascist murderer acting on racial principles? Yes, finns were.

Look at the entire idea of what the western frontier represented, and how it was over romanticized for generations touting the idea of “rugged individualism” being the end-all be-all.

Here, read this really long wiki page about [""African-American culture""]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_culture#Contemporary), do you wonder why there isn't an ""African-German culture"" page or a ""African-British culture"" page? because black people in those and other European countries didn't create their own differentiated culture, they are integrated(or at least that's the aim) into the broader German/British culture in a way that they can provide aspects of their original culture into it but are still part of the same group of people. 

Here, read some more about [African-American Vernacular English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English). There is no ""African-Spanish vernacular Spanish"" spoken by blacks in Spain because there isn't a common African identity black people are supposed to embrace, black people and any other immigrant are supposed to embrace their local Spanish culture thus creating a united society that doesn't give a single fuck about the color of your skin or your race.

[Can white people really be racist towards other white people?](https://satwcomic.com/white-on-white-hate-crime)

I mean the dictionary definition, the EU definition and the UN definition ALWAYS stated ""ethnicity or race"" under ""racism"". It feels like we've gone through a phase of collective amnesia. Why throw away a perfectly serviceable definition that actually describes our countries' interaction in favour of an imported American definition that itself is based on a centuries-old European definition that we've long abandoned?

I've yet to find a single person in real life, left or right, that actually divides the world into Caucasoids, Negroids, Mongoloids, etc. It's fucking bizarre! And yet I have found plenty of people who might say, for example ""Fuck those Albanians/Poles/French!"". It's such a fundamentally useless theory towards describing racism that I genuinely have to wonder if any of these people have ever studied history!

Seriously, according to some people's definitions most genocides weren't actually racist incidents because they were all of similar skin colours. Armenian - nope. Rwandan - nope. Ukrainian - nope.

By seeing mistakes that people have made, you can reverse those mistakes and hope not to make them again.  You can figure out how you got to where you are.  To understand the present and future you have to understand the past.

Here's a photo that I posted elsewhere which explains it kind of well, I think: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYz4uj8UwAAeAtJ?format=jpg&amp;name=medium

You can't just declare an unequal system as equal and then expect everything to be fine.  You have to put effort into correcting the structural problems that led you to where you are.

Again, not an expert on the Sami so I can't give a great example there, but America's treatment of our indigenous people involved kicking them off their land, forcibly moving them across the country, giving them empty and unproductive land that nobody wanted.  Do you think that that kind of treatment might change their current fortunes?  If your forebears were kicked out of Helsinki and sent to the frozen norths, are they likely going to have accumulated as much intergenerational wealth, or might it be more likely for them to be subsistence farmers/hunters?

Another comment told me a little bit about the Sami being forced to lose their language, and thus their culture.  Isn't that a little damaging to a people, to be forced away from that?  And isn't that something that a lot of anti-immigrant/racist types in Europe complain about, immigrants coming in and not learning Finnish, and saying that that's damaging to Finnish society?  If it's damaging to Finnish society, then isn't it also damaging to Sami society?  But in the latter case, it was done forcibly.

Right now Canada is dealing with some very painful history of exactly that - indigenous children were sent to ""residential schools"" where they were taught, essentially, to ""be white.""  These were very abusive.  And they're finding unmarked graves, mass graves, etc., near these residential schools right now.  People are really, really pissed about this.  That's all history, but I think it's clear that that's history which is worth learning about, and which can inform our current treatment of indigenous people.  I am sure the situation is not as bad with the Sami, but, who knows?  A lot of people are just learning about this situation in Canada, and hadn't heard about how abusive these schools are before.

None of this has anything to do with blaming you, personally, for history.  But understanding how we got to where we are and how we can have more justice in the future.

4410,"&gt; Do life partners have the same joint rights that married partners have?

In the way I described - they are prevented by law from having any negatives that married couples would have. I'm no legal expert so I don't know if it means they have absolutely the same rights, but from what I understand is that this doesn't ensure that, for an example, if the state decides to sponsor married couples for whatever reason, they couldn't leave out life partners. So technically - no. But that's the consequence of them not being the same thing, really, that different rules can be applied to them. In this case, it's only ensured that there is no negative impact that is different - i.e. you can't prohibit adoption from one and not the other without some other reason.

&gt; So the chart accurately reflects your country's position on discriminating between straight and LGBT marriages?

The chart says 55% for (marriage being between man and woman), so I would assume there either being sampling bias or the 10% accounts for the people being misled into voting for. The general sentiment, against sex marriages, is the same yes.

But I would argue it's not about anyone discriminating against gay people (people generally do not), but because marriage here is tied to religion, as we are a secular but mostly catholic country, and according to christianity, same sex marriages can't exist. Which is the reason people have this stance.

The reason why marriage wasn't separated from religion is because life partnership already existed in the law, so it was easier to just implement it under the constitution if the answer to the original question was affirmative rather than ask if the people would want a redefinition (which they don't have the right to, as ordinary laws can't be created/edited/removed by referendums, only the Constitution)",,/r/europe/comments/oc5brr/support_for_same_sex_marriage_by_country_in/h3tgdt0/,20022012,1625241380

4498,"The thing is the scale of the immigration. Contrary to the Remain narrative of ""most immigrants come from outside the EU anyway"", EU immigration was drastically underestimated while non-EU migration was overestimated (see link below). Ultimately, EU immigration was double the non-EU one. You can see this also in the stats on foreign-born mothers, with children born to mums with non-EU roots shrinking in numbers and those born to EU mothers growing instead.

Lastly, again, it is not about who the migrants are and what they pay, but about England's carrying capacity. This is a country of 130.000 sq. km with the population of Italy (likely to surpass Italy soon), 300.000 sq. km. It cannot sustain ongoing waves of EU immigration just because it had the mixed blessing of having English as its official language. You cannot have every Piotr, Radu, Dovydas, Enzo and Fernando move to the UK just like that because they want to make some bucks, speak only English as a foreign language and cannot be fussed to try (and probably fail) to move to Canada or Australia.

4503,"I feel that you underestimate how rounding works in that case.

If you do calculations (of distances) on a km basis, rounding up to a meter makes sense (millimeters would be an overkill).

If previously you were calculating that same distance by meters then rounding up to a centimeter makes sense. 

Now calculating the same distance using the old way You’ll be more precise as in the first example a rounding will add potentially 1000 millimeters whereas in the second one you’ll add 10 millimeters maximum.

Now the round at individual level, it almost has no impact, but at a company/country level it might, which in turns has consequences on people.

France wanted the euro, as said in the comment above, but the level at which it has been set has cut any hopes for countries with low currency to compete in terms of exportation (which has not been the case for Germany since the difference between mark and euro was lower). So when you say that the money is not leaving, it’s not true. Just check the balance of trade of Germany and compare it to the countries struggling and you’ll see the difference post-euro. 

See tradingeconomics.com for example, you can compare countries by balance of trade (under trade after choosing a country).

4599,"It's official history? I'll just copy-paste from wikipedia

The Delors report[10] of 1989 set out a plan to introduce the EMU in three stages and it included the creation of institutions such as the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), which would become responsible for formulating and implementing monetary policy. It laid out monetary union being accomplished in three steps. Beginning the first of these steps, on 1 July 1990, exchange controls were abolished, thus capital movements were completely liberalised in the European Economic Community. Leaders reached agreement on currency union with the Maastricht Treaty, signed on 7 February 1992. It agreed to create a single currency, although without the participation of the United Kingdom, by January 1999.[4]

Gaining approval for the treaty was a challenge. Germany was cautious about giving up its stable currency, i.e., the German Mark,[11] France approved the treaty by a narrow margin[12] and Denmark refused to ratify until they got such an opt-out from monetary union as the United Kingdom, an opt-out that they maintain as of 2019.[13] On 16 September 1992, known in the UK as Black Wednesday, the British pound sterling was forced to withdraw from the fixed exchange rate system due to a rapid fall in the value of the pound.[14]

4. Decisions of local interest (eg. county administration).

4687,"More, actually, at least in my impression. Singapore is a democracy which likes to pretend it's a dictatorship while the UK is an Etonian oligarchy pretending to be a democracy.

Yes, the PAP does mess around with elections in the sense that opposition parties never really get much of a media platform. The difference to the UK there isn't that such shenanigans happen (who owns the UK media?), but that the PAP, when it sees opposition to its policies, actually re-evalues its policies and regularly adapts them.

They won't ever do that with the ethnical mixing stuff, their stance is that any individual hardship stemming from enforcing mixed neighbourhoods is irrelevant in the face of the policy having successfully prevented ethnic tensions to again come to a boiling point: That's the dictatorship part, the ""the state knows best"" thing. Something like re-thinking social security because it fucks over young people, though? Yep, they're actually doing that.

What's special about Singapore as a state and government is the absence of corruption and pandering to specific segments of the population, the PAP are true technocrats.

4693,"&gt; I mean, the chef of the public broadcasting outlet ard faktenfinder (""fact finder"") argues that simply reporting the facts w/o hammering in their own stance isn't journalism at all. Absolutely despicable mindset. 

I don't know what he specifically said but curiously one time one of the higher ups at the ÖR is right about this. Their usual position seems to be ""we just report objective facts, we don't have an ideological slant (like the different newspaper)"". This is a lie. Of course the ÖR does not merely report objective facts. An inherent necessity of journalism is that it always has a specific slant. Objectivity in this way is impossible. It's not journalism, it's prophetic truth-speaking (which is of course ridiculous). 

Of course you can aspire to a certain ideal of objectivity in the sense of reporting multiple sides, refraining from stating things that make specific recommendations (in totality this is already pretty difficult though) or you could base your media on specific dialectic principles (doesn't have that much to do with objective truth either but at least it's an attempt to consider different angles). I think however even as an aspirational ideal objectivity is difficult because of how easily we fall prey to our own illusions. I remember one Tagesschau where Zamperoni more or less said that they are 100 % objective which is utter bullshit and shows fundamental disregard for the audience. I've also sadly been very disappointed in the ÖRs abilities as of late as they seem rather incapable of showing different perspectives well. I would much prefer a more diverse programme without this claim of complete objectivity. This is also why I enjoy FAZ and taz the most. They are very open about having a specific ideological slant, they have a specific agenda and that's fine and productive. 

I'm of course not saying Tagesschau or ZDF heute should be some hyper agenda driven thing but over the past couple of years they've done so much BS under the veil of objectivity.",For a Europe of the Regions!,/r/europe/comments/obskvy/emmanuel_macron_warns_france_is_becoming/h3smte5/,tobias_681,1625227232

/u/TheFinnishChamp 

It's not accurate, I think. This post explains other way of parsing that; [How The West Was Won](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/25/how-the-west-was-won/). It's just national cultures dying, because communication barriers are falling apart. Why would cultures based on 'imaginary lines on the map' persist in a world where people increasingly can be relied upon to understand English (and translation tools are getting better ridiculously fast now, with ML explosion), and participate in &lt;global&gt; discussions (like, reddit)?

For the longest time I was confused about what people mean about different cultures altogether; now I understand that it _is_ meaningful - national cultures aren't entirely dead. Lots of (generally old) people don't participate in global culture all that much. But they _are_ rapidly dying. Anyway, some quotes:

&gt; I am pretty sure there was, at one point, such a thing as western civilization. I think it included things like dancing around maypoles and copying Latin manuscripts. At some point Thor might have been involved. That civilization is dead. It summoned an alien entity from beyond the void which devoured its summoner and is proceeding to eat the rest of the world.
&gt; 
&gt; An analogy: naturopaths like to use the term “western medicine” to refer to the evidence-based medicine of drugs and surgeries you would get at your local hospital. They contrast this with traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine, which it has somewhat replaced, apparently a symptom of the “westernization” of Chinese and Indian societies.
&gt; 
&gt; But “western medicine” is just medicine that works. It happens to be western because the West had a technological head start, and so discovered most of the medicine that works first. But there’s nothing culturally western about it; there’s nothing Christian or Greco-Roman about using penicillin to deal with a bacterial infection. Indeed, “western medicine” replaced the traditional medicine of Europe – Hippocrates’ four humors – before it started threatening the traditional medicines of China or India. So-called “western medicine” is an inhuman perfect construct from beyond the void, summoned by Westerners, which ate traditional Western medicine first and is now proceeding to eat the rest of the world.
&gt; 
&gt; “Western culture” is no more related to the geographical west than western medicine. **People who complain about western culture taking over their country always manage to bring up Coca-Cola. But in what sense is Coca-Cola culturally western? It’s an Ethiopian bean mixed with a Colombian leaf mixed with carbonated water and lots and lots of sugar. An American was the first person to discover that this combination tasted really good – our technological/economic head start ensured that. But in a world where America never existed, eventually some Japanese or Arabian chemist would have found that sugar-filled fizzy drinks were really tasty.** It was a discovery waiting to be plucked out of the void, like penicillin. America summoned it but did not create it. If western medicine is just medicine that works, soda pop is just refreshment that works.
&gt; 
&gt; The same is true of more intellectual “products”. Caplan notes that foreigners consume western gender norms, but these certainly aren’t gender norms that would have been recognizable to Cicero, St. Augustine, Henry VIII, or even Voltaire. They’re gender norms that sprung up in the aftermath of the Industrial Revolution and its turbulent intermixing of the domestic and public economies. They arose because they worked. The West was the first region to industrialize and realize those were the gender norms that worked for industrial societies, and as China and Arabia industrialize they’re going to find the same thing.


---

&gt; Here’s what I think is going on. **Maybe every culture is the gradual accumulation of useful environmental adaptations combined with random memetic drift. But this is usually a slow process with plenty of room for everybody to adjust and local peculiarities to seep in. The Industrial Revolution caused such rapid change that the process become qualitatively different, a frantic search for better adaptations to an environment that was itself changing almost as fast as people could understand it.**
&gt; 
&gt; The Industrial Revolution also changed the way culture was spatially distributed. **When the fastest mode of transportation is the horse, and the postal system is frequently ambushed by Huns, almost all culture is local culture. England develops a culture, France develops a culture, Spain develops a culture.** Geographic, language, and political barriers keep these from intermixing too much. Add rapid communication – even at the level of a good postal service – and the equation begins to change. In the 17th century, philosophers were remarking (in Latin, the universal language!) about how Descartes from France had more in common with Leibniz from Germany than either of them did with the average Frenchman or German. Nowadays I certainly have more in common with SSC readers in Finland than I do with my next-door neighbor whom I’ve never met.
&gt; 
&gt; I stress these points because the incorrect model of “foreign cultures being Westernized” casts Western culture as the aggressor, whereas the model of “every culture is being universalized” finds Western culture to be as much a victim as anywhere else. Coca-Cola might have replaced traditional yak’s milk in Mongolia, but it also replaced traditional apple cider in America. A Hopi Indian saddened that her children no longer know the old ritual dances differs little from a Southern Baptist incensed that her kids no longer go to church. Universal values have triumphed over both.


Also, [The Melancholy of Subculture Society](https://www.gwern.net/The-Melancholy-of-Subculture-Society), about society fragmenting into subcultures. It might seem contradictory to the stuff above, but it's not - universal culture is just a relatively shallow common framework. As it needs to accommodate ~everyone. And subcultures are nothing like national cultures.

&gt; As ever more opt out, the larger culture is damaged. The culture begins to fragment back into pieces. The disconnect can be profound; an American anime geek has more in common with a Japanese anime geek (who is of a different ethnicity, a different culture, a different religion, a different language…) than he does with an American involved in the evangelical Christian subculture. There is essentially no common ground—our 2 countrymen probably can’t even agree on objective matters like governance or evolution!
&gt; 
&gt; **With enough of these gaps, where is ‘American’ or ‘French’ culture?** Such cultural identities take centuries to coalesce—France did not speak French until the 1900s (as The Discovery of France recounts), and Han China is still digesting &amp; assimilating its many minorities &amp; outlying regions. America, of course, had it easy in starting with a small founder population which could just exterminate the natives.
&gt; 
&gt; **The national identity fragments under the assault of burgeoning subcultures. At last, the critic beholds the natural endpoint of this process: the long nightmare of nationalism falls like a weight from the minds of the living, as the nation becomes some lines on a map, some laws you follow. No one particularly cares.** The geek thinks, ‘Meh: here, Canada, London, Japan, Singapore—as long as FedEx can reach me and there’s a good Internet connection, what’s the difference?’ (Nor are the technically-inclined alone in this.)
&gt; 
&gt; You can test this yourself. Tell yourself —‘The country I live in now is the best country in the world for people like me; I would be terribly unhappy if I was exiled.’ If your mental reply goes something like, ‘Why, what’s so special about the USA? It’s not particularly economically or politically free, it’s not the only civilized English-speaking country, it’s not the wealthiest…’, then you are headed down the path of opting out.
&gt; 
&gt; This is how the paradox works: **the Internet breaks the larger culture by letting members flee to smaller subcultures.** And the critics think this is bad. They like the broader culture⁠, they agree with Émile Durkheim about atomization and point to examples like South Korea⁠, and deep down, furries and latex fetishists really bother them. They just plain don’t like those deviants.",Earth (Poland),/r/europe/comments/obskvy/emmanuel_macron_warns_france_is_becoming/h3sdakp/,Sinity,1625220019
4763,"&gt;Idk why so many people try to paint historically Catholic countries like some backwards conservative backwaters like Catholicism is worse or more controlling than every other branch of religion.

Yeah. I've had discussions about this. I'm still not sure but I have a theory. The US and the UK have shaped the way many people see the world and they're mainly Protestant countries. they also represent two interesting trends:
   
In the US Catholics are a ""loud minority"". Religions often radicalise when they become a minority in foreign Territory. This has pushed many Americans to believe Catholics are by default more religious and conservative.
 
In the UK, there has been a certain amount of historical political propaganda. The reformation changed northern Europe profoundly and politically it made sense to call the catholic southerners ""backwards"", ""poor"" and ""traditionalist"". This POV has infiltrated history in nefarious ways.

Depends on the status of marriage in the country, and benefits that it allows. If there are benefits, they are probably meant as a way to secure stability of the marriage for the sake of children. Putting aside the topic of adopting of children by homosexual pair for now - why would they be able to enjoy the same benefits as heterosexual pair that can reproduce? And why I, as a single, can't get them too? How about solo marriages?

Why does elderly people and children have also lots of benefits from the country - like cheaper tickets? Aren't all people equal? Well, not really, some rights are exclusive for a reason. You may think that nobody is harmed by making these rights more inclusive, but that may not be true - giving benefits for more people means it costs country more, which may lead to decrease in benefits.

And I'm not even touching the topic of social effect of these, that may be even more important. We already have problems with marriages having less weight, increasing rate of divorces etc.",,/r/europe/comments/oc5brr/support_for_same_sex_marriage_by_country_in/h3sdgb1/,Marrkix,1625220153

*How will abolishing police lead to civilization collapsing?*

Its speculative, since no country has abolished police in modern history. However there are plenty of parts of the world that have underresourced or ineffective police, inevitably some cartel, militia or warlord rises up from the authoritative vacuum.

Essentially without fear of punishment, the only incentive to follow laws is empathy/conscience - which not everyone has. If i want to rob from you, the only thing that can stop me is you - and only if youre stronger, more powerful.

Since 1972, a total of 48 referendums have been held by EU member states, candidate states, and their territories, with several additional referendums held in countries outside of the EU. The referendums have been held most commonly on the subject of whether to become a member of European Union as part of the accession process, although the EU does not require any candidate country to hold a referendum to approve membership or as part of treaty ratification.

First thing first, he never said what you just wrote.
Then, in France, everyone is free to have the religion he choses. No one is forbidden to pray, or do whatever they want in their personnal life. 

But once it comes to the public domain, Or the institutions, everyone should be equal, therefore no religious signs are tolerated. 

This particular law was taken in the early 1900s to reduce the immense impact the Catholic Church had over the country. And it worked. Nowadays, the Catholic church is only what it should be: a religious institution. 

Now the ""problem"" with Islam is that it's trying to differentiate itself from others on certain points, like the headscarf,which goes against the principe or laïcité. 

Except the far right, no one is anti Muslim. The state even paid recently for the construction of several Mosquées in the East.

I’m a white person from a mixed family, it is eye opening to actually have real friends and even family who can talk to you openly without fear of being silenced or belittled for sharing their everyday experiences with racism.

 He is right that an increased awareness of the things minorities go through (racism) was exported from the US, because of the vocal and cohesive minorities that banded together and fought through activism for an equal standing in society. Now other minorities in Europe are doing the same, and while every country is not the same, structural racism is endemic to all societies.

It’s a fact that structural racism was exported from Europe to the rest of the world (on slave ships for example) so we should not be shocked that ideas that oppose this very racism is now flowing the other way back.

5038,"I think a lot of Europeans do not understand the idea of what assimilation is in the US is not the same assimilation in Europe.

Assimilation in the US is one of Dual identity. You adopt an American identity but you keep the old one too. This is why, even though it's been hundreds of years, the US still has Chinatowns, and Little Italy's. it's why we have entire regions of cities were everyone speaks Spanish.  And recently has started getting Little Nigeria's and Little Ethiopia's. That why you still have Americans who have never been to Italy saying they are Italian-American. Why you can see African families still wearing dashikis but speaking perfect English. Or the one room on campus were all the Muslims students go to pray between class.

But no one cares(Ok, fine some people care, but most don't). In fact you will usually find those ethnic communities are some of the top spots to eat, shop or just walk around.

People are more willing to adopt new culture when they don't feel their old one is threatened.

But that does mean you have to tolerate that yes, some of them will still wear their old clothes, speak their old language, listen to different music, prefer to name their children names of their old country or language.

I'm generalizing here but most cards do have a very extensive breakdown of your expenses, some even going as far as grouping payments into different categories (e.g. groceries, gas, restaurants, etc.). In any event, pretty much every card comes with some kind of push notification giving you a brief overview of your grand total after every payment. Of course, so do many bank accounts these days.

I'm absolutely no fan of those payment plans either (which is exactly why I never opted in or immediately opted out if it was the default setting) and you have a valid point when it comes to incentivizing overspending but at the end of the day, it's not too different from the other risks that generally come with living above your means - pick your poison, if you will.

Now you could argue I don't live in the US nor in Canada and thus have a limited experience of what you guys are excited about, from what I've seen and read however, it's just something to brag on a dinner because it was too dull to be simply American from European settlers ( Note that I don't share that point of view at all )

Finally you could say I'm biased yes but I surely read a lot of things about the Acadians and the Cajuns, while I'm deeply grateful they managed to save their culture and most importantly their language - let's face it even if the state of French in NA is shameful - I'm not sure that's really the case for the Germans or Dutch. Again mileage varying here.

 &gt;An interceptor aircraft, or simply interceptor, is a type of fighter aircraft designed specifically for the defensive interception role against an attacking enemy aircraft, particularly bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. There are two general classes of interceptor: light fighters, designed for high performance over short range; and heavy fighters, which are intended to operate over longer ranges, in contested airspace and adverse meteorological conditions.

 &gt;The Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano (English: Super Toucan; pronunciation), also named ALX or A-29, is a Brazilian turboprop light attack aircraft designed and built by Embraer as a development of the Embraer EMB 312 Tucano. The A-29 Super Tucano carries a wide variety of weapons, including precision-guided munitions, and was designed to be a low-cost system operated in low-threat environments. In addition to its manufacture in Brazil, Embraer has set up a production line in the United States in conjunction with Sierra Nevada Corporation for the manufacture of A-29s to export customers.
 
**[Tupolev_Tu-95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-95)** 
 
 &gt;The Tupolev Tu-95 (Russian: Туполев Ту-95; NATO reporting name: ""Bear"") is a large, four-engine turboprop-powered strategic bomber and missile platform. First flown in 1952, the Tu-95 entered service with the Long-Range Aviation of the Soviet Air Forces in 1956 and is expected to serve the Russian Aerospace Forces until at least 2040. A development of the bomber for maritime patrol is designated Tu-142, while a passenger airliner derivative was called Tu-114. The aircraft has four Kuznetsov NK-12 engines with contra-rotating propellers.

Wait, seriously?  I missed that.  I saw the thing on cutting off financial market access, but not this.

Okay, there's some truth to it, but this sounds like it was a not-particularly-seriously-considered theoretical potential outcome, not an explicit threat from the EU.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/blackout-risk-spooks-switzerland-after-eu-raises-no-deal-stakes

&gt;Now, the shine is wearing off that star as Switzerland confronts the threat of being decoupled from the European electricity market. The power sector has become the latest battleground for the European Union, which is looking to bring the country to heel after it refused in May to sign an agreement governing practically all its relations with the bloc.
&gt;
&gt;With no accord, the Swiss won’t be allowed to participate in the region’s so-called power-market coupling and, starting July 1, its certificates of origin, showing electricity bought and sold is generated from a renewable source, won’t be accepted in the bloc. The increasingly fraught relations with Brussels are beginning to spook the Swiss, prompting gallows humor about national blackouts. While large-scale power outages remain a remote possibility, concerns are mounting that the standoff with the EU will eventually mean higher costs for Switzerland’s people and businesses.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/obpbu3/swiss_pick_us_f35_jet_and_patriot_missiles_for/h3rayjk/,duisThias,1625192800

Your espousal of a Right wing, abused, and corrupted economic perspective accounts for your inability to rationalise. If anything, you should read some Peter Boettke so you have proper economic understanding instead of your garbage, flake driven drivel.  

&gt;Peter J. Boettke is a University Professor of Economics and Philosophy at George Mason University, as well as the Director of the F. A. Hayek Program for Advanced Study in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, and BB&amp;T Professor for the Study of Capitalism at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

&gt;Through an analytical framework strongly influenced by the paradigm of Austrian economics, as well as other intellectual traditions personified by thinkers in the mainline of economic thought—such as Adam Smith, F. A. Hayek, James M. Buchanan and Elinor Ostrom—Boettke has developed a robust political economy research program that expands an understanding of how individuals acting through the extended market order can promote freedom and prosperity for society, and how the institutional arrangements shape, reinforce, or inhibit the individual choices that lead to sustained economic development.

As for 'hate' no one does it better than a country that murdered between 60,000,000 and 100,000,000 of their fellow citizens and refused to apologise for it.

5590,"I think we're looking too much from today's perspective. Some of those words didn't exist a few hundreds of years ago and are also  used by others around the world. For example we didn't have a need to say *stradă* or *șosea* or other distinctions because those things didn't exist here in the past in a physical form to name them differently, it was just *uliță*, everything we ever knew. So later when we had to see them in other places, or develop those later on, we borrowed those words from italian and french where they existed. The same is happening with so many other words we have, for example *operă* or *dificil* or others that we didn't have a word for it because it wasn't needed but are latin as origin, although we got them from others quite late. These words borrowed later on make up for almost half of our latin origin vocabulary, most of them from french but quite a few italian as well.

Let's take for example *preot*. From the time when we have written stuff, all the church ranks were old slavic or old greek names (stareț, călugăr, popă, episcop etc). Back then it was a *dascăl*/*popă* reading from the *ceaslov*, *liturghier*, *evanghelie*, *moliftelnic* etc. All these words are either old greek or church slavonic. A lot of the words are through old slavic (church slavonic was official) but they were loans as well. For example we say and said *popă* but in the old romanian writings we see the word *protopop* (from protopopu or something), which is greek. Some others were latin borrowings. If we look back a few hundreds of years ago, let's say 16th century or later, we see that priests were well versed in latin as well and had written stuff in latin. We also had the influence of catholic church and writings in Transylvania, using many times the latin language. In the 17-18 century we had more influence from italian and french through people going there more often to study but that's another story, but before that latin was still used but churches. These also explains why some of the words we have is from later latin language seen in Italy. They were later borrowings, mostly through educated people (knew how to read and write) which were the majority priests. And for every latin word we see there are like ten more of slavic or greek origin related to religion but not directly related to orthodoxy. For example the holy ghost/spirit exist everywhere in christianity but we say *sfăntul duh*, both words coming into our language through old slavic, same as with *iad* (hell) as we didn't say infernum (later borrowing), same as we didn't say *festival* (another late borrowing for holiday) we said *praznic* and so on and on. A lot of these latin words we have a re very late borrowings from later latin circulating in churches.

It's not what I said nor what the other person who said something like this, meant. English is harder than it seems at first glance but it's the absolute truth.

There are several moderators in the original sentence which precludes it from being a blanket statement. Notice the word so: ""Well, actually, if the Turkish weren't **so** homophobic I would have decent chances of finding love there.""

This modifies the sentence so it doesn't imply 'all Turks are homophobic', what it does is that it modifies the sentence so it says ""I consider Turkey to be too homophobic to be able to live a life that goes with my LGBTQIA+ lifestyle"".

I mean, The Netherlands is seriously still way too homophobic, especially in the light of how it's viewed abroad. It's just not too homophobic for me to live in. Russia? Too homophobic. Hungary? Too homophobic as well.

I merely said that as a world heritage site, it is not solely an internal matter how it is used.

&gt;The decision to turn Ayasofya into a mosque or museum or cathedral does not belong to the UNESCO

I also, never, said that. Though it is worth noting that UNESCO were neither notified nor consulted in regards to the conversion, which is *technically* not in breach of the treaty, but pretty questionable behavior regardless.

It is, because *how* it was converted entirely sidelined.

Also, on another note. I don't think you believe this.

Hagia Sophia is important to more countries and cultures than just Turkey, and its reconversion was clearly a provocative stunt to try and fan the flames. Its reconversion was clearly done to *get* an international reaction (and to boost internal polls of course, which didn't work).

5693,"&gt;grandpa did well, kiddo just gave up on picking up.

Grandpa is still saying ""you should just walk up to the factory and ask for a job in person, like I did in the 70s!"". It worked for him then, that doesn't mean it works now.

&gt;The EPR has been described as ""a cathedral within a cathedral"". Yes, there's lesson to be learn there. But that doesn't eliminate the demonstrated proof of what was previously achieved. If Denmark try out a fancy 20 blades IA controlled wind turbine and end up a complete failure, would that disqualify wind power?

If it takes them 15 years and 19 billion to come to the conclusion that they can't make it work, that would strongly suggest withholding further investment until they get their shit together.

&gt;In the case of France, this is an image of the game being played: Operation (green), technical outage (red), administrative outage (orange) .

How are ""works to prevent sodium fires"" ""administrative"" outage?

&gt;As far as cult, or faith base conviction goes, I wouldn't bet too much against the ""let's jump off the cliff, renewable will be there to catch us"" crowd.

But that's the thing: if you tire of the wind turbines, you take them down and that's it, perhaps you have to write off a decade of potential production as loss, but that's not that much. You can't get rid of nuclear power that easily. It's nuclear power investments that require a 80-year deep leap of faith, which is then followed by a 1000 year deep leap of faith for dealing with the waste. And that's not optional, you're stuck with it even if you change your mind.

It's hard for old people to use electric devices like smartphones or computers, but even if they make it through that part they won't find a good source, because they only know how to read in Hungarian or a little bit in Russian, non of the elders understand English. Most of the Hungarian internet sources are in hands of the Fidesz. You are also not considering the largest factor, human behaviour. Those old people are not buying what younger people say as they think of themselves as wiser and they have their sources (medias in hand of Fidesz).
 If you can hardly pay the bills while you have to feed the six children you bringed to life, you would accept that shitty sack of potato for exchange of 1 or 2 votes, no matter where you're from.
 When the new law about pedophiles and LGBTQ+ teaching was passed, most of the the madia only talked about how they succesfully stood up against the pedophiles, while not saying anything that now teachers can't teach the kids in their sexuality matters. One week later the media said that non ruling party politicians are against the pedophile law, when they were only against the banning of LGBTQ+ teaching part.

5857,"The places where you return cans and bottles here in Sweden have lists on how many cans or bottles saves enough energy to do various things (assuming average energy cost of doing those things, I'm guessing). For example:  
  
2 cans = making oatmeal in the microwave daily for one week  
  
4 cans = having the oven on for 30 minutes  
  
6 cans = using computer for 24 hours  
  
185 cans = heating a medium sized house for 24 hours  
  
8 bottles = fridge on for 10 hours  
  
14 bottles = drive a moped for 10 kilometers  
  
39 bottles = using a hair straightener daily for half a year  
  
70 bottles = toasting two slices of bread daily for a year  
  
277 bottles = running the washing machine 60 times at 40c  
  
etc  
 
According to a couple of other pages, around 2 billion cans and bottles are returned in Sweden every year, with the 1.8 billion being returned in 2016 saving 360 million kWh of energy (equal to the annual use of 167000 people).

Lviv: 

the Lviv pogroms. The NKVD executed several thousand inmates in a number of provisional prisons. Among the common methods of extermination were shooting the prisoners in their cells, killing them with grenades thrown into the cells or starving them to death in the cellars. Some were simply bayoneted to death.[3] It is estimated that over 4000 people were murdered that way, while the number of survivors is estimated at approximately 270.[15] A Ukrainian uprising briefly forced the NKVD to retreat, but it soon returned to kill the remaining prisoners in their cells.[21] In the aftermath, medical students described the scene at one of the prisons: ""From the courtyard, doors led to a large space, filled from top to bottom with corpses. The bottom ones were still warm. The victims were between 15 and 60 years old, but most were 20-35 years old. They laid in various poses, with open eyes and masks of terror on their faces. Among them were many women. On the left wall, three men were crucified, barely covered by clothing from their shoulders, with severed male organs. Underneath them on the floor in half-sitting, leaning positions – two nuns with those organs in their mouths. The victims of the NKVD's sadism were killed with a shot in the mouth or the back of the head. But most were stabbed in the stomach with a bayonet.

5911,"Yeah, whenever I hear people lauding how Eastern Europe is doing well only thanks to EU I feel like they are taking the piss. ""But, they got access to the EU MARKET!"" Yes, and they had no capital to increase production enough to make use of it, nor the efficiency of scale to compete with the western corporations. Free access goes both ways. The moment eastern europe joined the EU the wealthy western corporations bought out every local business and consolidated. As a result they got investment, so that they can build big factories, manned by lower wage workers than in the west, to produce products that are sent back west, and being labelled as not produced in their countries sometimes, all so that they get as little tax or profit out of it as possible. This was never a strictly good deal, it cost them a lot. No country will be giving another loads of money if they don't expext to benefit from it themselves.

Using Poland as example, polish sugar used to be almost 100% produced by a state owned companies. Then it got privatized, in 2003 and 2004 most of the production capacity got bought out by German companies at very low rates. Now less than half the sugar is produced by the remnant of the state owned cooperative consortium. The rest is produced by german Nordzucker, Sudzucker, and Pfeifer &amp; Langen in Poland and mostly exported back with no tariffs.

5920,"&gt;The population is a huge issue. It's pretty small and hasn't seen an increase for a long time, it even fell around 1 Million compared to the peak in the 1990s.

I am so tired of this talking point.

It's all scaremongering by the corporations who want the populations to keep exploding so they can keep growing their customer base.

Meanwhile, it's been historically proven that a decrease in population will improve the lives of the average person. Like when the black plague killed 1/3 or so of the population in Europe, it drove forward human rights, because the lords (aka feudal CEOs) didn't find enough workers, so they had to pay more/give more rights to those that were available.

Here are some advantages of decreasing populations:

* less pollution, less pressure on the environment
* workers are better positioned to ask for more rights
* fewer children per family means each child gets to inherit more, which helps people accumulate/build inter-generational wealth
* less demand for goods, services, including stuff like housing and land, which drives down the prices for those things, which results in even better quality of life

On the other hand, there's mainly one boogeyman used to scare people and convince them that decreasing populations are good: ""WHO WILL PAY OUR PENSIONS !!?!?!?!""

Which is absolutely stupid, because a slow and steady population decrease is 10000% sustainable. 

Let's take your example, of 1 mil ""lost"" over 30 years.

1 mil = 2.5% of 40 mil (Poland's population), again, over 30 years.

That comes to a decrease of 0.08% per year.

&gt;Not only this but the population is ageing rapidly, which is the countries biggest challenge and could lead to a disaster.

 Lead to disaster ? 

0.08% ?

I hope this helps you put things into perspective, since 0.08% is way way lower than the usual margin of error. I hope that helps you see it's scaremongering and corporate propaganda. 

&gt;The only issues the government is tackling are pollution and income inequality

No idea how much your government is doing to help those things, but, like I said, a steady decrease of population will naturally help those.",,/r/europe/comments/obg3tt/a_tale_of_two_countries/h3nzduy/,kyle_dai,1625133486
