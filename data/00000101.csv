The principalty of Kiev, Smolensk, Chernigiv and The Republic of Novgorod..were different political entities that even fought each others. So where the literal continuation you are talking about ? The Principalty of Moscow was a vasal state that absorbed other principalities. The Tsardom of Russia was another whose administrative and military organisation completely differed from Kievan Rus' and The Principalty of Moscow.

126,"Ruling party PiS (national-conservative, Christian democratic, right-wing populists) wants to force the election by any means, because the incumbent conservative President Andrzej Duda (also PiS) is ahead in the polls.

Here are some things about the planned postal elections:

1. Citizens will receive their voting cards by mail. Ordinary letter, not registered mail.

2. People can add themselves to voter list (give their current address) no later than the moment the new law comes into force. So one is supposed to do this under yet non-binding law, because after it becomes binding, it is to late to change address.

3. The law comes into force in May. The country will have only a few days to print 30 million counterfeit-proof voting cards, plus the same number of voter statements (to write your name, and PESEL number, and put into voting envelope together with voting card), plus 90 million special envelopes, and deliver these to 30 million voters. It's the same country that can't manufacture and deliver a few million face masks to hospitals.

4. The envelopes with your voting card will go to a **single** special post box in every city. One in every city. Only Warsaw will have one per district. We have 10 cities over 250,000 people. We will have safe postal elections by mail, because of pandemic. And ~200k voters in the city will have to be at this one post box on one day. Normally the bigger cities have 100-500 polling stations.

5. Normally every polling station has a separate electoral commission of a few persons plus a special place for volunteer citizen watchers (to ensure transparent and lawful elections). Now, every polling station (the one post box per city) will have **ONE electoral commission** of up to 45 members (for cities over 250k inhabitants, less for smaller cities). In Kraków there are 600k registered voters, and 45 persons to verify and count all the votes. The electoral commissioner can deputize more persons for the commission, under unspecified mode. Possibilities are endless.

6. The polling post box will be emptied multiple times a day, and the votes will be delivered by mail man to the electoral commission. In a country where sometimes mail men dump letters to garbage, to ease their burden. Anyone can be a mail man here. My mail man has prison tattoos on his hands.

7. Electoral commission will verify your vote by comparing name, surname and PESEL number. It won't verify your signature or whatever. PESEL is a unique personal identifying number. It contains your date of birth plus 5 additional digits. 11 digits. You use it everywhere, so tens or hundreds of people have access to your PESEL. Even when you rent a kayak, they will xerox your ID (PESEL is there). In recent years there have been many database leaks from various institutions. Sometimes it's 250 thousand names with PESEL numbers, sometimes 800 thousand.

8. National postal service (Poczta Polska) will be relieved from other postal duties while delivering the voting cards before elections. They normally deliver 3.5 million letters a day. There will be 30 million voting sets to deliver. If anyone needs to have other stuff delivered during this time - they have a problem.

9. In Poland it is a crime to: destroy, damage, conceal, modify, counterfeit, or steal voting cards.

10. If my voting card ""**disappears**"" from the voting box, is someone wanted for theft, or will I be wanted for concealing the card?

11. Purchasing and selling the ""voting sets"" (envelope + envelope + voting card + identity statement) isn't a crime yet.

12. The new law allows for putting other people's votes into voting box. So on the election day people walking around with bags filled with voting cards won't be anything suspicious.

Besides all the pratical, legal and democratic problems of these instruments this logic is a fallacy that it will save the EU. It ignores the fact it will not solve some major underlying problems and it will be perfect ammunition for anti-EU parties. Especially in the already hard times to come. 

Some probably do not like it but the EU is probably better saved by making a compromise this time. Large sums of investment but still implementing certain reforms in exchange which were taboo in the past. In this case more sympathy/support for solidarity and the risk burden can be created.

194,"On Monday (April 6) Polish Parliament passed a controversial bill under which **presidential elections in May** would be held by **postal vote only**. Ruling party PiS (national-conservative, Christian democratic, right-wing populists) wants to force the election by any means, because the incumbent conservative President Andrzej Duda (also PiS) is ahead in the polls.

Here are some things about the planned postal elections:

1. Citizens will receive their voting cards by mail. Ordinary letter, not registered mail.

2. People can add themselves to voter list (give their current address) no later than the moment the new law comes into force. So one is supposed to do this under yet non-binding law, because after it becomes binding, it is to late to change address.

3. The law comes into force in May. The country will have only a few days to print 30 million counterfeit-proof voting cards, plus the same number of voter statements (to write your name, and PESEL number, and put into voting envelope together with voting card), plus 90 million special envelopes, and deliver these to 30 million voters. It's the same country that can't manufacture and deliver a few million face masks to hospitals.

4. The envelopes with your voting card will go to a **single** special post box in every city. One in every city. Only Warsaw will have one per district. We have 10 cities over 250,000 people. We will have safe postal elections by mail, because of pandemic. And ~200k voters in the city will have to be at this one post box on one day. Normally the bigger cities have 100-500 polling stations.

5. Normally every polling station has a separate electoral commission of a few persons plus a special place for volunteer citizen watchers (to ensure transparent and lawful elections). Now, every polling station (the one post box per city) will have **ONE electoral commission** of up to 45 members (for cities over 250k inhabitants, less for smaller cities). In Kraków there are 600k registered voters, and 45 persons to verify and count all the votes. The electoral commissioner can deputize more persons for the commission, under unspecified mode. Possibilities are endless.

6. The polling post box will be emptied multiple times a day, and the votes will be delivered by mail man to the electoral commission. In a country where sometimes mail men dump letters to garbage, to ease their burden. Anyone can be a mail man here. My mail man has prison tattoos on his hands.

7. Electoral commission will verify your vote by comparing name, surname and PESEL number. It won't verify your signature or whatever. PESEL is a unique personal identifying number. It contains your date of birth plus 5 additional digits. 11 digits. You use it everywhere, so tens or hundreds of people have access to your PESEL. Even when you rent a kayak, they will xerox your ID (PESEL is there). In recent years there have been many database leaks from various institutions. Sometimes it's 250 thousand names with PESEL numbers, sometimes 800 thousand.

8. National postal service (Poczta Polska) will be relieved from other postal duties while delivering the voting cards before elections. They normally deliver 3.5 million letters a day. There will be 30 million voting sets to deliver. If anyone needs to have other stuff delivered during this time - they have a problem.

9. In Poland it is a crime to: destroy, damage, conceal, modify, counterfeit, or steal voting cards.

10. If my voting card ""**disappears**"" from the voting box, is someone wanted for theft, or will I be wanted for concealing the card?

11. Purchasing and selling the ""voting sets"" (envelope + envelope + voting card + identity statement) isn't a crime yet.

12. The new law allows for putting other people's votes into voting box. So on the election day people walking around with bags filled with voting cards won't be anything suspicious.

France, Sweden, and Italy are all part of the same trade bloc and have extremely good diplomatic relations. They are having trouble with facemasks import/export. How is it at all surprising that China, who has no skin in the game at all is also choosing to be selfish?

The idea that China is somehow a bad actor here is laughable in my opinion. They are basically supplying the entire world with face masks. The reason why China can even do this is because they have all the supplies and production.

If you cut the subsidies, those farms go out of business, and their lands can be taken over by bigger more productive farms. Food production could actually go up if you cut the subsidies.

448,"In 2018, the number of years a person is expected to continue to live in a healthy condition at birth in the European Union (EU) was estimated to be 64.2 years for women and 63.7 years for men.

Life expectancy for women (83.7 years) in the EU was, on average, 5.5 years longer than that for men (78.2) in 2018. Healthy life years represent approximately 77% and 81% of the total life expectancy for women and men respectively. 

Among the EU Member States, Malta recorded the highest number of healthy life years in 2018 for women (73.4 years), followed by Sweden (72.0 years) and Ireland (70.4 years), whilst the highest numbers for men were also recorded in Sweden (73.7), Malta (71.9) and Ireland (68.4).

In contrast, Latvia had the lowest number of healthy life years for women (53.7 years) and men (51.0 years). Extreme values can partly be explained by the way in which activity limitation is measured in the country, impacting, to some extent, on the results.

The number of healthy life years at birth was higher for women than for men in 19 of the EU Member States, with the difference between the sexes generally relatively small. In 5 EU Member States the gap was more than 2 years: Poland (+3.8 years), Bulgaria (+3.6 years), Lithuania (+2.8 years), Latvia (+2.7 years) and Estonia (+2.3 years).

At the opposite end of scale, in seven EU Member States the number of healthy life years for women was lower than for men. The largest differences were observed in the Netherlands (-3.9 years), Denmark (-3.4 years) and Finland (- 3.1 years).

We also have a lot of old people dying im homes that haven't been counted.

As for confirmed cases, we aren't testing as we should (have one of my best friends in direct contact with a positive case, was told to stay home and someone would contact him, no-one did. after a week called services, again someone will contact him, guess what? 2 weeks passed and no-one contacted him.

My ex-wife is working in the health services (answering first line phone calls called Saude24). She told me they have some 'recommendations' to tell people to wait at home knowing full well they will never be tested.

Also there is a big difference in agreeing with measures and openly mocking somebody for them. It's similar to the facemask/gloves thing. Many people may not find them effective or necessary but barely anyone goes around and openly laughs at people for wearing them. At least I haven't yet seen anyone doing so.

It's a fact.

&gt; I suppose you are the first person complaining for sources, but I am bad at debates... Dude I understand that for you it's Netherlands uber alles but at least you must make an effort.
you can establish whatever you want. I ve shared many articles that shows the negative impact Netherlands have. 
Nah you just want to excuse Netherlands practices claiming that what they have been doing for years is a minor inconsequential thing.

The thing is that you've not actually read any of these sources as you simply googled tax evasion and then hope you wouldn't be called out on your bs. Economics claim the tax evasion is 22 billion annually. You claim it's more but you can't actually cite a number or even an estimate.

The Netherlands tax policy is a minor inconsequential thing when put into context of the current topic we're discussing in the sense that countries with vastly more tax fraud, up to 9 times as much, cannot make a moral argument that the Netherlands is, morally speaking, not allowed to ask for conditions when it comes to funding these countries.

Or to put it simple
dodging taxes by being a""Tax haven"" for 22 billion annually is bad.
Dodging 200 Billion euro in taxes and then demand the rest of the EU pays your bills unconditionally: way fucking worse.

&gt;The fact that german banks profited from greek crisis, where the policies implemented almost destroyed the country.

Oh really? You think that is what almost destroyed the country? Not the years of financial fraud that Greece commited or the absolutely bonkers social policies it maintained for years? It's going to take a long time before Greece comes back together but from what I gather, the economy has been un an upswing for a number of years so its going into the right direction.

&gt;I get that when you have Dutch politicians saying crap like that south europe spends its money in wine and women, (and said countries let it slide)

Yeah they let it slide...y'know, outside of the public outrage and these countries demanding that he get fired from his job. 

&gt;Obviously it is within Netherlands rights to propose ESM instead of other means, noone said the opposite.

You know this is rather interesting because I believe it was you who said that it was opportunism to ""Force"" (Because setting conditions for giving aid is forcing now, apparently) and that it was, and I quote: "" really funny seeing the tax haven of the union giving morality superiority lessons.""

Which clearly implies that you thought the Netherlands, with vastly less tax fraud than Southern countries, is in no position morally speaking to demand conditions for providing aid.",,/r/europe/comments/fvcsq9/eus_von_der_leyen_calls_for_marshall_plan_for/fmn34eg/,Lawljungles,1586217203

No, the state does not owe you food, healthcare, a place to stay etc. The state should organize things such that deserving people (law abiding, hard working) should have a good life and nice stuff, and shitty people (e.g. drug addicts without a job) should live like shit, not have an apartment provided for by the state, which takes 50% of my income.

720,"That's the point, the people in UK were not victims of fraud.

The NOx cheat test was designed to beat the US emissions tests and standards meaning people in the US, who buy diesels based in part on NOx rating if they want cleaner cars in the same way we have the CO^2 standard for our car tax, were indeed victims of fraud.

However, we are not in the US, we're in the UK. Go to any car room and ask the cars sales staff what NOx emissions the car has, 99.9% chance they will have to go look it up in the manual because it's not a thing here and nobody makes any deal out of it - provided it's under the limit for MOT testing nobody who ever buys a diesel would ever care.

The legal case in the UK is claiming being need to be compensated because they lost money yet none of them can show how they lost money. The NOx does not affect CO2 (thus whether the car should be in a higher band costing them money) nor does it affect MPG (as it only works during lab tests). As I have pointed out on this post, independent valuations experts Glasses' Guide said that the car values were not affected in any real way and Autocar said over a year on, there was no drop in people searching for VW family cars nor any drop in the sale price. The point being - there **was no financial loss**. The NOx emissions stuff I mentioned above is why the people lying about the environmental  impact are also frauds - nobody buys a diesel in the UK based on NOx emissions (else they wouldn't buy one full stop), people buy them for low car tax and high MPG (assuming they actually drive them properly and don't treat them like a petrol).

There is no need for compensation as nobody in the UK lost anything as a result of this. Just a bunch of grubbers whining BUT MAH FREE MONEH and employing a bunch of leeches (Slater &amp; Gordon) who will take 30% of any refund as part of the class action suit which isn't necessary for anyone who wants to try and get compo anyway.

763,"Dont you think you are overprojecting a bit? 

&gt;For me, anything that says that men should do something just because  they're men, and men sustaining that belief, is already sexist and, in  this particular case, toxic masculinity. 

I think you are oversimplifying this. I agree that some social pressure like this toward people is just not necessarily. I am a heterosexual male, however pretty sensitive, interested in art (i was working with fine arts actually), balet, etc... cooking, cleaning, washing my clothes etc... and for people closeminded people it is hard to understand. And i agree that pushing this ""men should do this and dont do this"" narrative is rather funny, for lack of better words. But this is not male related, is it? In such societies with (unnecessary) strong gender roles, this narrative also affect women.

I dont understand how on one hand you want to say that patriarchy is the reason, because men oppress women, and at the same time there is a map where men in those countries commit suicide 7 times more often.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The top roles in society —religion too— have always been men, so if the  base of men in society are hurting from this, one would argue that it's  because of what the people from their own gender do or don't do,  wouldn't you agree? 

No i wouldnt. First of all, for example slovakia have female president as we speak. Second, those men in charge are not representative of the whole gender. How crazy is this idea? It is like like saying that there is some male conspiracy against women, that only men put men in charge and women have no word in this. In politics, they can run for office and can be voted in by other women - how is this gender related? And in position of power in private sector? They can also start a company the same way as men do. How many men try to run their business and not become billionaires? Many! This is not gender issue, if i was making an argument about this, i would say men are willing to make a bigger sacrifice for career than women, which prefer more balanced lifestyle in general. And even then we speak of a very small group of very ambitious and scrupulous men, who basically sacrifice everything in their lives just for career and even then, most of them is never going to ""make it"". Women can do the same, they just choose not to. I am of course not saying that there is no difference in cultures and there are not cultures where it is easier for women than in other cultures.

But this opinion that it is religion based or some male conspiracy against women is weird. And in orthodox religions - men and women play usually different roles, it doesnt necessarily mean it is wrong for one or another - of course there are people who dont fit in those roles, that is one of many reasons why i personally dont like religion mixing with politics etc... and i am saying this as an atheist - sort of, because atheism is not well define, and everyone has his own definition.",Slovakia,/r/europe/comments/fw2j6j/the_gender_disparity_of_suicides_in_europe/fmmnnze/,Moldsart,1586208616

The reason why Germany engaged in the spring offensive was because they knew that millions of Americans would arrive in Europe in the summer of 1918 and they had to win the war before they arrived.

If the US has never joined the war, then Germany wouldn’t have done the spring offensive and wouldn’t have depleted its military. That would have caused the war to continue for a while.",,/r/europe/comments/fvxdil/on_this_day_1917_usa_officialy_declared_war_on/fmmnwxh/,CheWeNeedYou,1586208748

This may mean that the ruling party is intending to postpone the election to May 17. It is more time to prepare correspondence choices.

&amp;#x200B;

Today's sitting of the Sejm

‹Come back

The PiS project is another attempt to change the electoral law a few weeks before the election

In this way, the ruling party wants to give Poczta Polska more time to prepare correspondence elections

Earlier, **as a result of a split in the club of the ruling party in the Sejm**, work on the previous draft amendment to the Electoral Code did not start

&amp;#x200B;

Elections a week later?

Pursuant to the new PiS bill, the provisions of the Electoral Code, according to which the presidential election ""is ordered by the Speaker of the Sejm no earlier than 7 months and no later than 6 months before the expiry of the term of office of the incumbent President of the Republic of Poland, and will set their date for free from work falling not earlier than 100 days and not later than 75 days before the expiry of the term of office of the incumbent President of the Republic. ""

The project submitted on Monday assumes that if an epidemic is announced on the territory of Poland, the Marshal of the Sejm may order a change in the date of the elections specified in the order previously issued. The new date for the presidential election set by the Speaker of the Sejm must correspond to the dates for the presidential election set out in the Constitution.

100 days before the end of the term of office of the President falls on Tuesday, 28 April 2020, 75 days before the end of the term of office is Saturday, 23 May. This means that the presidential election may take place on one of May Sundays: 3, 10 or 17.

&amp;#x200B;

The Sejm is to deal with a draft of special rules for holding general elections for the President of the Republic of Poland ordered in 2020 today.

Onet's information shows that Law and Justice wants to give themselves more time to prepare correspondence choices. **It is almost certain that the Senate, in which the majority has the opposition, will want to make the most of its 30 days to take a stand on the draft amendments to the Electoral Code.**

**If the Sejm sent the bill today to the Senate and the upper house of parliament kept the document for a month, the new law would come into force on May 7** at the earliest, that is, three days before the presidential election. Everything seems to indicate that Poczta Polska would not be able to send packages with electoral cards to all voters.

Our sources say that the Speaker of the Sejm was probing the National Election Commission in this matter. She was even to send a letter asking about the legal possibilities of changing the order setting the date for the presidential election on May 10. We sent questions in this matter to both the Chancellery of the Sejm and the National Electoral Office. We are waiting for answers.

&amp;#x200B;

**""Violation of the Constitution""**

This scenario has been talked about today in the lobby from yesterday. Left Treasurer Tomasz Trela ​​(chief of the electoral staff Robert Biedronia) wrote about such a scenario on Twitter: ""**The whole weekend rozkminy and apparently have it. Tomorrow by force correspondence voting. Marshal Elżbieta Witek changes the order and moves the election to May 17 (not legal, but pisowski)** "".

**- Codes of procedure principle violated. It follows from the Sejm Regulations that it should be longer than in the case of ordinary laws. In order to be able to work on amendments to the electoral law, you have to wait 14 days from delivering the draft amendment to the deputies - Mariusz Witczak tells Onet.**

A member of the Civic Coalition points to other legal flaws in this project: - **You cannot manipulate the date of elections already ordered, which results directly from the constitution. This is a violation of the Basic Law. Elections may be postponed, but after one of the states of emergency is introduce**d - he emphasizes.

&amp;#x200B;

Stormy deliberations

Earlier, MEPs did not agree to put on the agenda the previous PiS draft regarding correspondence voting. It was supposed to be the only method of voting. (A new draft ruling party upholds this solution).

228 deputies were in favor of including the draft on the agenda, 228 were against as well, **3 abstentions**. Therefore, the motion to include the draft in the agenda did not obtain a majority. **All those who voted 'for' are members of the PiS club.** **Among the voters ""against"" were deputies of opposition clubs and 3 deputies from the PiS club:** **Wojciech Maksymowicz and Michał Wypij from the Agreement and Grzegorz Puda from the PiS.**

&amp;#x200B;

See also: PiS wants correspondence choices for everyone. What should they look like?

The mail will stop delivering ordinary shipments

**The new PiS project assumes that the presidential election in 2020 will be conducted only by postal vote. The same solution will apply in the second round of elections. Voting will take place without a break from 6am to 8pm.**

During these hours, voters - alone or through another person - will have to place a return envelope in a specially prepared sender mailbox in the commune, where they appear on the voter list.

The new draft also states that the destruction, damage, concealing, altering, counterfeiting or theft of a voting card is punishable by imprisonment of up to 3 years. On the other hand, a person who without permission opens an electoral package or a sealed returnable envelope *will be subject to a fine.*

Also, a fine may be imposed on a person who unlawfully destroys an electoral package or a sealed return envelope.

In order to vote, voters in the country will not have to submit requests to use the option of voting by correspondence. In turn, voters residing abroad, intending to vote by correspondence must notify the competent consul up to 14 days before election day. The notification may be made orally, in writing, by fax or in electronic form.

According to the draft, the postal operator obliged to provide universal services will ensure - within a period of 7 days to the day falling before the day of election - delivery of the election package directly to the voter's mailing mailbox to the address indicated in the voter list.

**The project also shows that Poczta Polska will practically stop handling other orders for a moment: ""A postal operator obliged to provide universal services while performing the tasks referred to in this Act is exempt from the obligation to provide other postal services"" - we read.**

We wanted to ask about this proposal the new president of Poczta Polska. Tomasz Zdzikot, until recently deputy defense minister, did not answer the phone.",,/r/europe/comments/fw51bb/pis_wants_to_delay_elections_voting_on_may_17/fmm9bvc/,AdministrativePilot3,1586201183

Lower mortality rates for this condition, when we are far away from ICU saturation (which the swedes say is not happening yet) probably mean different sensitivity at ID'ing cases. 

The number of reported cases is not, ever of course, the real number of cases and it is measured through the ""apparatus"" of a country's testing  capacity and protocol. The more tests a country does (Norway is for example doing twice as many per capita than Germany ) the more assymptomatic and low-symptom people it catches and that lowers the mortality rate. The higher the mortality rate the more likely the country is only testing very obvious cases with lots of symptoms.

The lower the mortality rate, the lower the percentage of positive tests, the more likely is that the country is being effective at preventing infection chains and that the slope will remain predictable.

964,"&gt; You could also see Brest-Litovsk as freeing various people from the Russian yoch. Poles, Baltics, Ukrainians, Belarussians and Finns all got their independence from Russia. 

It would have been if it were not for the Reich demanding outrageous compensations and sending the army into the supposedly independent Ukraine to steal the food supplies Germany needed. The Baltic nations were never meant to be independent but made into German vassal states, hence all the Kings that were supposed to take these new thrones were Germans. (For example, Finland was due to receive a Hessian...)

&gt; Oppose Prussia when it was France that declared war and invaded because they used the Spanish throne dispute to achieve their lifelong goal of having the Rhine as the Eastern border? 

Bismarck, a politician whose skills are seen bit once in a generation, managed to trick Napoleon III into starting the war with Prussia. That a war with Prussia was coming was plain for all to see, as Prussia had made war on Austria and Denmark for territorial gains already, and Germany was eyeing the rich regions of Alsace-Lorraine. The Ems Dispatch was the perfect trap, and for this I can only salute his cunning.

The Rhine is France's natural Eastern border, and having made it once again so at the end of WW1 would have very much changed the situation when 1939 came around. Napoleon's 100 days was a colossal mistake for France and put it in a weaker position in the long term as the border was redrawn in 1815...

&gt; And let's not forget that they offered the Entente a peace in 1916 with no annexations or reperations to just stop the bloodshed. 

Such a peace would have been a huge mistake. Millions would have died just to return to the volatile *status quo ante bellum*. This would have been followed up by another big flare up. As history has shown us, Versailles left Germany insufficiently constrained and left too many Germans feeling that they had not been beaten. That no peace was made with Nazi Germany until its complete occupation in 1945, because the lesson was learned, though the hard way.

As for the reparation, Germany had laid waste to the North France (which a century on, still bears the scars) and looted most of Belgium. The lack of reparations could never be accepted by France and Belgium. And no annexation, no peace could have been acceptable without the return of Alsace Lorraine to France.

The whole 1916 peace offer was merely a publicity stunt (as were to some extent Wilson's points). Just as the demands that Austria made to Serbia in 1914 could never be accepted, neither could such a peace. In each case, outrageous offers were made simply for the sake of saying that an offer was made.",EU,/r/europe/comments/fvxdil/on_this_day_1917_usa_officialy_declared_war_on/fmlvvss/,Carnal-Pleasures,1586194182

993,"&gt;Find a source that says otherwise. Don’t just say I don’t like your sources so it’s not true.

I am sorry, but **opinion** pieces and politicians opinions are not a source. Try again.

If you understand German, I can offer you this (from a real Economist):

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b8IRUGzPRk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b8IRUGzPRk)

&gt;This is extremely faulty logic. Are you saying nations cannot make mistakes? They cannot simply leave the euro any longer either, their debt is in euro , their economy runs through euro, they’re engrained in it. It makes it difficult to leave.

Greece specificly had an option to exit the Euro, yet they didn't choose to take it. They had haircuts on their debt anyway. It certainly wouldn't have been easy, but if Germany oppresses Greece, why would the Greek continue to agree to that?

Ironically, leaving the Euro would have been, by far, the best option for Greece - in the long run.

&gt;Germany benefits from it at the others expense. This is not a benefit but the opposite for the southern nations only for Germany. So yes Germany should even it’s benefits to the other euro countries. Or they should dissolve the euro so Germany does not take advantage of the weaker economies.

By what **miraculous** mechanism does Germany's economy thrive at the expense of the South's (and not through their South's own mistakes, e.g. being too expensive)?

Don't say ""because Germany is too cheap"". That doesn't make sense, at all. Nobody benefits himself by being **too cheap**. Would you claim that you benefit at the expense of your employer by accepting a lower salary at a different company? I don't think so.

Germany's economy would actually benefit from more expensive exports. It would decrease quantity of the actual physical goods that are exported, but it would, on net, increase profits.",,/r/europe/comments/fvi512/germany_still_says_no_to_coronabonds/fmlwda2/,Medical-Cry,1586194428

That being said the balance of power was pretty delicate and it would've taken one more country to tip the scales. Russia capitulated in 1917 that same year, there were a series of French mutinies and French morale was declining. Had the reinforcements not arrived French morale likely would've broke. Add to that German reinforcements from Russia and no American reinforcements and we get a different war entirely.

You need 1 hour of Labour to create 1 Brick.

Suddenly the currency gets devalued by 50 %.

1211,"I have to say it's quite amusing to watch you claim how others live in a ""binary world"" when your entire argument is binary itself.

We can break your entire argument down into one sentence: The Netherlands is to give up its sovereignity and send a blank cheque to Southern European countries because tax haven. That's all that matters, Tax haven.

Lets break it down how silly this arguement is. The Netherland's tax system costs nations around the world about 22 billion Euro's a year. That's all nations combined.

I don't know how familar you are with economics, but 22 billion euro is a drop in the bucket for any country, nevermind when its 22 billion that is split among every single country. Bear in mind, that's not to defend it: It's bad and it's currently being removed entirely, but to  even begin claiming it's even partial contributing to the Netherlands success or using it as justification for saying that the Netherlands is not allowed to set conditions to the money it GIVES to southern European countries OUTSIDE of the UNCONDITIONAL HELP its already currently offering is silly.

To put this into perspective: Italy and Italians ALONE avoids paying 200 Billion(!!) Euro in taxes every single year due to their shadow economy. That's about 25% of its national GDP.

I have no idea how you can deny that it's opportunistic. They literally took a previously rejected proposal in Eurobonds, they changed the name to corona bonds and then proposed it again. I'm sorry but I literally can't think of a more text book case of opportunism than that.

The Netherlands and Germany are offering southern countries aid unconditionally in this crisis. This about what happens after the crisis is over. Soutern countries have been racking up the debt for years. We literally have a huge fund setup that they can apply to receive additional funding, it just comes with conditions which are completely reasonable.

To put things into perspective:

The Dutch have to pay more taxes, pay the most per capita to the EU, have to work much longer than the southern countries and yet they are STILL to donate money UNCONDITIONALLY to countries with lower pension age and pay less taxes because ""hurdur 22 billion euro tax haven"" when those countries literally commit tax fraud for hundreds of billions of euro's more than Netherlands does and are avoided by the Dutch tax system?

You don't want to accept ""being lectured"" (What you really mean is, receiving aid conditionally) by a country which dodges far less taxes than yours does? That's totally fine.

My family is from Trabzon (father side) and Isparta (mother side). I live in Istanbul, Tekirdağ was for army and pre-after army stay. Antalya was touristic, Hatay, Konya and Kars were visits to local areas and Ankara is the capital so you really visit there a lot, again not for tourism.

After this virus shit is done, remind me and i'll go out and ask hundreds of random taxi drivers about strays, i can guarantee you it won't make it into their list of troubles in the slightest yet ""terrifying"" list. Or follow your own advice and come and ask yourself, we both know you won't though.

In my 30 years here i was bitten once by a dog which was protecting her newborn babies. That's it. It can sound ""terrifying"" or ""shocking"" to some traveler that always lived where strays seen as pests, but this is simply not true for Turkey and ESPECIALLY for Istanbul.

&gt;Although there is no clear basis for this belief in the Koran, strict Muslims consider dogs — especially their drool — to be unclean. People don’t let the animals into their homes because they could dirty the prayer rug and because, even today, little tradition exists of keeping dogs as pets.

This is why majority of mosques - especially in Istanbul - have a stray that lives and fed by imam. Right.  When it was heavy raining just last year, we left most mosques open for strays to shelter themselves in as well. 

Rest of it goes to historical stuff. And remember this was written 8 years ago. It only got better since then but even when they wrote this, especially for Istanbul part i can say it is highly editorialized and dramatized for the reader to read.",,/r/europe/comments/fvtb4g/turkey_to_protect_street_animals_amid_covid19/fmkxhat/,Ecmelt,1586172326

I already count at least 2 that are by definition overal not hard technical and one that is such an umbrella term that it shouldn't be in here.

1. Read into research about dating. You still seem to think that people are logical, they ain't. There are many aspects that really hard to put into hard statistics. Also dating ""rituals"" change a lot and rapidly. Take Tinder, it's 8 year old. It changed the dating scene hugely in multiple ways, some even being complete opposites of each other. For example it made dating both easier as more difficult.

2. chances == probability. End of discussion. If someone never encountered anything toxic dating related, doesn't mean that the chance of encountering is is zero. Same way goes if a person has 50% of dating encounters be toxic. It's still whatever the original probability was.

And nobody isn't asking for unconditional support. 


&gt;You get a new government nearly every year for the last 70 years, you have terrible bureaucracy all over the country but especially in the south, your banks are stuffed with bad loans, you vote for populist / Anti establishment / eurosceptic parties like M5S, ... all while there is a gigantic unwillingness to reform. 

Kill us all! Hurry up before we take all your money! /s

&gt;„ Italy’s problem, as described by an official in Brussels, was not the euro but the lira. It yoked together a productive north with the sleepy Mezzogiorno. When Italy joined the euro, optimists assumed that being locked into a currency with Germany would discipline it. But the productivity whip failed to crack; wages and prices remained too high relative to Germany’s, and in the 2000s Italy was woefully unprepared for the rise of competition from China.“ 

What a load of crap. Wages are too high compared to Germany? In Italy? AHAHAHA

And beaurocracy is worse in the south? Ahahah sorry to break the news but Italy isn't a federation. The rules are the same North to South.
The problems of the South haven't been solved just by being in the same currency as Germany nor inflicting austerity (because that's the word, not discipline), and that Brussels official has no clue what's going on in southern Italy so why would he ever be able to give solutions?


Look, the problems with Italy are historical. The South has been poor for centuries, it has been stripped of the social texture during and after two wars, drafting men and women to work in the North who never came back. The central government has neglected the region for decades, refusing to address the crime and unemployment and even getting entangled in strange ways with the mafia. The industry it had after the industrial revolution was dismantled after unification, so was the considerable navy.

1421,"Yes and no - as in everything you say is correct but you miss the mechanism I reffer to. In essence the Eurobonds are such a problem because by pooling debt some states will benefit from the financial soundness of others (and vice-versa), in a way forming a fiscal transfer. The states want this because there are no (or well, not structurally and sufficient according to them) fiscal transfer and lending mechanisms.


The US system has a largely endogenous fiscal transfer and loaning. Take federal-state unemployment compensation. Compensation is provided by the state - if the state cannot afford to pay compensation any longer, they are able to take out a loan at the federal level. There are no long winded negotiations at that point. The federal gvt pays for this through their own taxes, or federal bonds. This is very similar to what Eurobonds represent: first the state tries to pay for things themselves, if that is not possible, they want an automatic loan at a rate which is based on the interest rate which investors would give the combined states - not just their own. Same for medicaid - the federal pays a percentage of expenditures. Thus, if you live in a state with higher costs, you receive support automatically.


I'm not saying that is a good or a bad system. I'm just saying that it is. The EU budget is less than 1% of EU GDP, the federal budget is around 20% of US GDP. Obviously, there is more room to move there and thus no need to have this same discussion as much.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/fvi512/germany_still_says_no_to_coronabonds/fmkkn7m/,DutchPhenom,1586158253

1471,"Britain has quietly obtained EU support to help cover the costs of repatriation flights from Japan, the US and Peru during the coronavirus crisis, taking advantage of a Brussels programme that subsidises efforts to bring back stranded nationals. 

The UK has run a total of at least six such jointly funded emergency flights as part of an EU scheme that has helped more than 14,000 people get home since the start of the pandemic, according to the latest European Commission data. 

The EU civil protection mechanism, administered by the commission since 2001 to help after natural disasters, covers 75 per cent of the costs of government-organised repatriation flights on condition that the passengers include citizens of multiple countries from the bloc. 

Britain, which left the EU in January, is still a member of the mechanism and fully covered by the co-financing scheme by virtue of the Brexit transition period contained in the withdrawal agreement between the two sides.

The six UK-organised flights in February and March collectively brought back more than 1,000 Britons and 122 EU nationals from 16 countries among their 1,281 passengers, according to the commission data, dated April 3. Four flights departed from Lima, one from Oakland and one from Tokyo. 

London’s involvement stands in marked contrast to its decision to shun an EU scheme to jointly procure ventilators and other medical equipment to combat coronavirus. It also highlights how the pandemic has focused attention on little-heralded yet potentially vital EU arrangements that the UK faces important choices on whether to join once the Brexit transition period ends in December. 

“The UK activated the [civil protection mechanism] as part of our international response to coronavirus, which helped repatriate EU citizens,” said a UK official. “It is standard practice to use the [mechanism] to recover costs in these situations.” 

The official said that Britain “remains a member of and contributor to” the mechanism throughout the Brexit transition period. “As such we are entitled to activate the mechanism in response to a crisis during this time.”

The commission data also show that, since the start of the crisis, about 200 Britons have been repatriated thanks to flights organised by EU countries with support from the mechanism. 

They include four UK citizens who made it home from Georgia on a flight organised by the Latvian government, and 85 brought back on an aircraft the Irish government arranged for people stranded in Peru. 

“We have helped bring back so far some 200 UK nationals on member states’ flights financed by the EU,” said Janez Lenarcic, the EU commissioner for crisis management. “We have done this in a spirit of good co-operation to get people home and reunite families.” 

Since the start of the crisis, the EU civil protection mechanism has supported a total of 60 flights, and it is reviewing requests from governments to help with over 200 more.

EU diplomats said the co-operation was common sense at a time when all countries were grappling with the challenge of getting thousands of citizens home amid the large-scale shutdown of the commercial aviation industry.

Unlike some other EU schemes, the civil protection mechanism is open to other countries and currently has six “participating states” from outside the bloc including Serbia, Iceland and Turkey. But EU officials said Britain had so far given no indication that it intended to continue participating after the Brexit transition period ended. 

A British government document setting out its plans for the UK’s future relationship with the EU does not mention civil protection, even though the bloc’s negotiating mandate does foresee the possibility of co-operation in this area. 

Rosa Balfour, director of Carnegie Europe, a think-tank, said repatriation flights were one of a “whole host of issues” around potential joint UK-EU action highlighted by the pandemic, ranging from consular collaboration to the search for a coronavirus vaccine.

“There is scope to continue that kind of co-operation, which is very practical and not really ideological,” she added. The UK approach to repatriation flights appeared to be a case of “if they can do it quietly, they will”, she said.",,/r/europe/comments/fvuf4f/uk_turns_to_eu_support_for_repatriation_flights/fmklbm6/,glumeme,1586158958

1543,"I’ve been doing some reading on stoicism and I’m beginning to believe it’s pretty great. The Nords do it so well and always sit high in happiness metrics. If the default attitude is “suck it up and get it done” people seem to rally; focusing more on the meaning generated from the goal than the perceived lack of something. On the other hand, if the default is “I should be 110% happy at all times,” then the focus becomes what is lacking instead of what is there. We humans seem to calibrate ourselves to whichever environment we’re in fairly quickly. This is why even multimillionaires can become depressed (and often do!) I think it’s built into us to continually explore/progress, but this can manifest in awful ways in the absence of genuine need. This lack of struggle has left a couple of generations with a total lack of meaning. Religion has tried to fill the void with varying success. Some people have filled it with politics and social causes. Ultimately we need to work in meaning and fulfilment as a concept or I think our existential despair will grow worse.

Marzena Paczuska: Now everyone is suffering from depression. In d ... it fell over

Marzena Paczuska, a member of the board of Polish Television, responded to his entry. - What depression? What breakdowns? People survived the camps, prisons and even two wars. You have to protect your life, gather strength to fight the crisis, keep serenity. And here some frustration is hysterical because of the ban on playing sports ?! - asked Paczuska, who has been suspended for almost a month on TVP. Earlier she was, among others adviser to the president of TVP and managed ""Wiadomości"".

When one of the Internet users noticed that it is necessary to wait until May to arrange a visit to a psychologist, Paczuska replied to him: Now everyone is suffering from depression. In d ... it fell over. Because life is so hard.

On Sunday evening, PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczyński met with the rebellious deputy prime minister Jaroslaw Gowin - Onet agreed.

Presidential election in Poland. Coalition crisis. Gowin and Kaczyński Photo: Leszek Szymański / PAP

Jarosław Kaczyński and Jarosław Gowin

‹Come back

For several days, both right-wing leaders have been publicly and behind the scenes waging war over the date of the presidential election

Kaczyński insists on May 10, and Gowin does not want to hear about it

Gowin claims that elections on this date are a threat to the health and lives of Poles. He did not want to agree even on correspondence elections within this period

But now Gowin is ready to make concessions. It would support the correspondence vote proposed by PiS, but as a general election formula. Without prejudging that the elections will be held on May 10

According to Onet, there may be a compromise between Kaczyński and Gowin. In one option, Gowin would support the correspondence vote proposed by PiS, but as a general election formula, without prejudging the presidential vote on May 10.

&amp;#x200B;

In practice, it would be Gowin's dodge. The Leader of the Agreement is anxious to face the several-day war with Kaczyński. He has repeatedly pledged that he would not support the organization of the election on 10 May and would vote against the introduction of correspondence elections at such an election date.

&amp;#x200B;

WE RECOMMEND: Tomorrow there may be a political earthquake \[ANALYSIS\]

Does this mean that the May 10 election will not take place? Gowin's people hope that PiS will not be able to carry them out. - The closer the election, the more it will be seen that it is impossible. First of all, there will be more and more sick and dead of COVID-19. Secondly, the Senate will prolong the work on the correspondence voting project and PiS will simply not be able to carry it out - says one of Gowin's people in an interview with Onet.

&amp;#x200B;

Crisis like never before

There has been no such serious political crisis in the United Right camp since the establishment of cooperation between PiS, Zbigniew Ziobra Solidarity Poland and Jarosław Gowin's Agreement in 2014.

&amp;#x200B;

The date of the presidential election became the spark of conflict. According to Onet, the voting on May 10 was initially opposed by a significant group of PiS politicians headed by the prime minister, who was supported by Health Minister Łukasz Szumowski. They convinced Kaczyński that sending 30 million people to the polls during the epidemic was a huge risk. They retreated when Kaczyński stamped his foot. Then Gowin entered the game. Taking advantage of the situation - without 18 MPs from his party PiS there is no majority in the Sejm - he put the veto. He was not even convinced by the fact that Kaczyński proposed voting on May 10 only by correspondence.

&amp;#x200B;

PSL temptation?

On Friday, Gowin proposed his own solution: a constitutional amendment extending Andrzej Duda's term of office to seven years. After this term, ending in 2022, Duda could not apply for re-election.

&amp;#x200B;

This option was acceptable for PiS. The trouble began when Gowin did not fulfill his promises. Well, in earlier talks, he promised Kaczyński support for some of the opposition to amend the Constitution. At the beginning it was about PSL.

&amp;#x200B;

Except that the people left Gowina on ice. In this situation, Kaczyński decided to do his job. His trusted head of PiS structures Krzysztof Sobolewski brought the aforementioned election project to the Sejm on Friday evening on May 10 only by correspondence.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, the PiS president postponed the session of the Sejm to Monday and gave Gowin several dozen hours to humble himself and support the election. ""It's obvious to me: elections cannot be held on May 10. I will convince the whole camp of the United Right because Poland needs our unity, ""Gowin wrote on Twitter on Saturday.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Onet's interlocutors, Kaczyński was even ready to expel him from the government. There has been a rumor in the political world that PiS is negotiating entry into the government with the PSL, which would preserve the majority if MPs leave the Covenant. Our interlocutors from the PSL leadership denied these rumors, so it could have been an element of pressure on Gowin.

Politically everything is possible. Maybe on Monday Jarosław Gowin will humble himself before Jarosław Kaczyński and the coalition will survive the crisis. If it remains hardy, then the current government may cease to exist. And new problems may arise with presidential elections - with early elections to the Sejm.

&amp;#x200B;

‹Come back

**When, due to the coronavirus, the state is experiencing the biggest problems in the last 30 years, the power camp is occupied by internal war - the most serious since PiS took power.**

The conflict was fueled by the date of presidential elections. Kaczyński proceeds to vote on May 10, although the epidemic will not go back by that time. Gowin does not want to agree to this

**The compromise was to postpone elections for two years by amending the Constitution. Gowin was to win the opposition's support for this solution, but he did not succeed**

In this situation, Kaczyński submitted to the Sejm a draft voting on 10 May in a letter and put the deputy minister of defense at the head of the Polish Post

He was even ready to expel Gowin from the government, but gave him time to surrender by Monday

&amp;#x200B;

Gowin assures that he will not give in. His stubbornness may even lead to early parliamentary elections

There has been no such serious political crisis in the United Right camp since the establishment of cooperation between PiS, Zbigniew Ziobra's Solidarity Poland and Jarosław Gowin's Alliance in 2014. **Our interlocutors from the power camp unanimously emphasize that this crisis may lead to the collapse of the government and even early elections . Jarosław Kaczyński, PiS president, is to be ready for such a scenario** \- as we hear from sources in the power camp.

On Friday, Gowin proposed his own solution: amending the Constitution, extending Andrzej Duda's term of office to seven years. After this term, ending in 2022, Duda could not apply for re-election.

**This option was acceptable for PiS.** Why? Because Kaczyński wants elections as soon as possible or as late as possible. **He expects PiS to drop in the next few months, which is why he is not interested in the elections in the fall or spring of next year. In addition, the PiS leader wants to have full power during the crisis, when it will be necessary to make unpopular decisions.**

\- If the election took place in half a year or in a year, then all the time there would be a fierce campaign and the government could do **nothing to harm** Duda - explains our interlocutor from PiS. - Kaczyński wants to have a government and a president to consolidate power during the crisis.

&amp;#x200B;

Gowin played by PSL

When on Friday afternoon Gowin publicly presented his draft amendment to the Constitution, PiS spokeswoman Anita Czerwińska wrote on Twitter: ""Bearing in mind Poland's interest, we support and will support Prime Minister Gowin's proposal, if there is a majority in the Sejm and Senate to support such a solution"" .

At this point, it seemed that Gowin had the full support of Kaczyński and that both of them would start lobbying for constitutional changes. Why did this not happen? The trouble began when Gowin did not fulfill his promises. Well, in earlier talks he promised Kaczyński support for some of the opposition to amend the Constitution. The opposition, especially the Civic Coalition, is necessary to amend the Basic Law.

&amp;#x200B;

As we agreed, Gowin talked about with the head of PSL Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz. - Gowin promised Kaczyński support from the people's party. This would ease our pressure on other opposition parties - explains our interlocutor from PiS. Therefore, when on Friday, after Gowin's presentation of the draft amendment to the Kosiniak-Kamysz Constitution, **he cut himself off from him,** Kaczyński was outraged. He decided that, first of all, Gowin was unbelievable, and secondly, **that there was no chance to change the Constitution.**

Our interlocutors in PSL argue that **Kosiniak did not promise Gowin anything.** But in the environment of the deputy prime minister there is a perception that the people's party made a volt due to the latest presidential polls.

Gowin has time to surrender

Once it was clear that the people left Gowin on ice, Kaczyński decided to act. His trusted head of PiS structures, Krzysztof Sobolewski, brought to the Sejm the project of organizing the election on 10 May in the freezer that would only be in correspondence. According to our interlocutors in PiS, **Kaczyński on Friday evening wanted to put the project to the vote. Then Gowin would have to take an unequivocal position, and in the event of opposition he would be expelled from the government.**

**Ultimately, however, the PiS president postponed the session of the Sejm to Monday and gave Gowin several dozen hours to humble himself.** The leaders of both parties broke off any contacts. ""It is obvious to me: elections cannot be held on May 10. I will convince the whole camp of the United Right because Poland needs our unity"" - Gowin wrote on Twitter confirming that he does not intend to change his position.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Law and Justice tempts govinists

**In this entire game, Gowin made a fundamental mistake. He assumed that, regardless of his skirmish, Kaczyński would do nothing to him for fear of the collapse of the coalition,** the collapse of the government and early elections.

He was wrong. Both our talks in the power camp and Kaczyński's actions - including the ultimatum to Gowin on support for the May 10 election - **indicate that the PiS president is ready for all variants in which Gowin did not believe.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Gowin: the election date is in the hands of the opposition today**

Constitutionalist: Jarosław Gowin's proposal is pointless

**There are opposition politicians who support Gowin's proposal**

Breakup of the coalition? Kaczyński is already preparing. According to our information, since Friday many of the Members of the Agreement have been persuaded by emissaries from Nowogrodzka to support the project introducing correspondence voting. Some of them are offered positions in government, others hear the threat of saying goodbye to their previous functions.

Onet's conversations with the members of the Agreement show that most of them are ready to wall behind Gowin. - We are determined to block the election on May 10. We proposed a rational compromise, **hoping that PiS would accept it. At the last moment he was rejected**. One thing is certain: we will not agree to the May election, even at the price of being expelled from the government, says Onet, an influential politician of the Agreement.

**But in the event of divorce, Gowin cannot guarantee the full loyalty of his people. According to Onet, several members of the Agreement are considering PiS support.** To maintain the majority, **Kaczyński would also have to pull MPs from the Confederation or from the PSL.** Kaczyński does not want the entire Confederation in the government, **while PSL will not join the government.**

&amp;#x200B;

Or maybe elections to the Sejm?

Had it not been for the majority, which would have threatened the collapse of the government, **Kaczyński would have to be ready even for early parliamentary elections. -** Surveys show that support for PiS exceeds 50 percent. Kaczyński would get out of such elections strengthened, **although of course adding another vote in the current situation would be a huge problem** \- says one of the PiS deputies involved in the conflict with the coalition partner.

**Gowin's people argue that the opposition offers him the chair of the prime minister. - Jarek got an offer from the opposition to become the prime minister of a new government consisting of the main opposition forces in the Sejm**. He rejected it - a close colleague of Gowina tells us.

&amp;#x200B;

Onet journalists checked this information. However, we have not confirmed them in any sources. - **It's not true. A PO, PSL and Left government with governors would have to be created. It would be an unstable coalition, which in the event of an epidemic would end in catastrophe for all of u**s - tells us the leader of one of the opposition parties.

Admittedly, the proposal of ""Gowin for the Prime Minister"" was publicly made by Senate Deputy Marshal and PO Nestor Bogdan Borusewicz, but in the political world this statement was received as an attempt to warm up the conflict in the power camp.

&amp;#x200B;

**The PO-Lewica-PSL-Agreement government variant assumes that all its deputies leave Gowin.** Only such a solution gives the new coalition an advantage in the Sejm - and it is the majority of one vote. Therefore, if Kaczyński pulls several deputies from Gowin, he does not have to be afraid of being removed from power by such an exotic coalition.

&amp;#x200B;

Kaczyński will take revenge

**We asked all our interlocutors - from PiS, from Understanding, from PO, from PSL - what is Gowin really playing about, leading to the most serious crisis in the power camp at such a difficult moment. Nobody could say that.**

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe these are ideals, a real fear for the health and lives of Poles, who were chased by Kaczyński until the election? Our interlocutors in PiS don't believe it. They remind us of Gowin's pre-election statement. He spoke at a distance about introducing the government",,/r/europe/comments/fvrc82/there_may_be_a_political_earthquake_tomorrow/fmk458j/,AdministrativePilot3,1586144096

\- We must return to normalcy as soon as possible. Because every day the Polish economy, and so all of us, lose many billions of zlotys. If such a condition is kept for more than a few weeks, then an overdose could turn out to be much more dangerous than the disease, he said.

&amp;#x200B;

So maybe self-promotion? After all, Gowin shows that he is the only politician in the power camp who can stand up to Kaczyński. It would be an investment in the future, just after PiS. Or maybe pragmatics at the same time? After all, the viral crisis can blow away the government and PiS, so it's better to evacuate this ship in advance - just like in 2013. Gowin escaped from the sinking Platform.

The government says they trust the advice of the experts of the responsible authority (Folkhälsomyndigheten, the government agency for public health), but there is also criticism in Sweden that the government has put themselves in the back seat and only makes decision on explicit request by the agency. I think it is mainly the agency's policies and judgements that have put Sweden where it is, and it is not completely transparent how they reason.  At least their public communication sounds more gut-feel reasoning and subjective than data-driven and based on models and simulations. I lack the crispness of the language I expect to hear in situations like this. Instead, quite a lot of ambiguity and hand-wavy explanations. I understand things will be uncertain but also basic questions on what forecasts they make go unanswered.

1664,"&gt; Companies don’t just invest in places because they are cheap and devaluing your currency isn’t the only way to make goods cheaper. If it was then companies would just move to Zimbabwe and then to the next cheapest economy.

They absolute do. Case and point: China, Mexico, Vietnam, India, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia. 

It’s a combination of having enough government oversight to be able for companies to operate and low currency so the wages to products can be profitable. 

So for example: Mexico has a currency that is matched to its country. So it’s currency is lower in comparison to say the USD. This allows Mexico to produce items cheaper than the US can and still sell them for more in the US. It also allows Mexico to produce more pesos when things like the corona come up which devalues the currency more but can offset the damage. 

Now apply this to the Spain/Greece. Their currency is artificially higher because it’s shared with Germany. This means production costs all the way down the line are higher and the purchasing power is lower for the employees. They are locked into a death spiral because the worse they do, the better Germany does. And the better Germany does the worse spain/Greece can do. The IMF gives Germany a 6% competitive advantage compared with the country’s economic fundamentals. **That is massive.** And that comes at the direct cost of Spain/Greece/ect.

The Euro has forced Europe into separate groups the overvalued and the undervalued. The overvalued are the producers and the undervalued are the consumers.

Yes, the high debts is the problem, otherwise the Italian economy would really be fine. But you can' just discount your debts with your spending.   
And with this there is a problem. In the past Italy has spend too much money and it has never recovered from that.  
Yet, with the treaty of Maastricht in 1993, countries that wanted the Euro agreed to strive to 60% debt of GDP and max. deficit of 3% annually. Italy has never come close to 60% GDP, yet they agreed to it and wanted in the Euro. This is also the biggest problem and I concur, other countries let Italy join so they are partly responsible as well, however Italy never held up their end of the bargain to try and have debt as 60% of GDP.   
I don't mean solidarity in EU, but in Euro because that is different.   
Because Italy has not held up their part of the treaty of Maastricht.  


If Italy wants euro-bonds it means that suddenly the high debt of Italy is the responsibility of all of Euro countries and Italian politicians are using Corona to make the countries that don't want that look bad. Italian politicians are politicizing corona by wanting to force Eurobonds.

Older age, male sex, and cigarette smoking are considered risk factors for IPF.32 Observational data have implicated gastroesophageal reflux,33 obstructive sleep apnea,34 air pollution,35 herpesvirus infection,36 and certain occupational exposures in interstitial lung disease.32 The investigation of subclinical disease with the use of computed tomographic (CT) imaging in population-based and high-risk cohorts has proved to be a powerful tool that may help identify new targetable risk factors for incident IPF, potentially leading to preventive interventions.37-40

Also, NHS in this case have probably jumped the gun, and used the word linked instead of ascosiated. IPF is degeenrative, and usually takes a long time to develop.

I think if the US proves to be not as bad as some places with universal healthcare then supporters think that will damage the argument for universal healthcare.   I disagree.  One anomalous event doesn't prove much in the overall scheme.  Also, if the US weathers this relatively better than expected then Trump looks better and that helps him at election time.

2134,"Before I start my rant, I have to say that first thanks and were brought on protesters against Milošević in Belgrade. 


Slovenes love to call withdraw of then still YPA a war. In reality, Milosevic and Slovenian big wigs agree on withdraw.


There was deffinitely war in Croatia. Croatia wanted independence, Croatian Serbs didn't want to live in Croatia as there was NDH still fresh in the minds of many. Milošević played this card and spooked local Serbs, and at the same time sacked their lidership. There were no clear plan how or what should be the end result of war in Croatia by political and military leadership of Serbs. The war died down by the time the war in Bosnia started.


There, Serbs and Croats didn't want to live in the state dominated by Bosniaks, and Bosniaks didn't know that there should be war. At the same time, Milošević and Tudjman had numerous meetings about what they should do with Bosnia and how to carve it up while technically still at war. They came up to some agreement, but again, they didn't want to go to full scale war in Bosnia with their armies, but tried to achieve their goals by proxy. They didn't count, again, on Bosniaks and what they wanted, and that the moment they choose to kill of a bunch of people isn't suitable any more for that. If that happened ten years ago, nobody would bat an eye (look at The big excursion), but after the fall of Berlin wall, we don't do that shit in Europe. Milošević underestimated the Bosnian Serb leadership, so he had to impose an embargo on them and do the Dayton thingy himself. Poor guy. For this, western media and establishment gave him a peacemaker nickname. 


During these wars, Serbia haven't been officialy at war, there were no draft, but there were numerous paramilitary organisations, sent in Bosnia and Croatia and armed by State security agency. These guys were something else. You see, regular army of Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia usualy didn't do really bad stuff, but those guys were sent there just for that purpouse it seems. They were criminals before and monsters after. They didn't care if you are man, woman, child, dog they just wanted blood and money. 


And then there is Kosovo. Kosovo was a part of Serbia until constitution of 1974. when it became autonomous province, along with Vojvodina. Only Serbia has been partitioned this way, and has been seen as historic unjustice to Serbia by nationalist Serbs in YCP. Kosovo Albanians were majority and were made to be loyal to Serbia or to be outside of sistem. They had influx of weapon from Albania, which have had a coup few years earlier, and many of military storehouse there have been pillaged. Some of Kosovo Albanians formed armed gangs which started to harass and kill not just police of Serbia but foresters, postmens, utility company workers, regular citizens, loyal Albanians, basicaly terror campaign against anyone who isn't them. So then police started antiterrorist campaign, then they escalated even more. Police, frustrated with KLA melting in to local population after their actions, started cracking everyone that they deemed fit, then Americans started to threat if things don't go quiet. Things didn't. Americans choose Albanian side and then organised Rambuyee conference where they set the stage in such a manner that Serbia have to accept all of demands of Albanians and Americans or we would be bombed. Of course, Milošević refused. Only then the military came in Kosovo and shit really hit the fan. Three months of bombardment campaign, Milošević steped down and agreed on different terms.

If closing schools and teach at home is not feasible for everyone, find a way how to maximize the desired outcome, while minimizing the threat - divide students into groups:

b) need some attention, 2 - 3 days a week attendance  
c) need little to zero attention, teach from home with consults

Half of all cases are in Stockholm, but if you look at the rural areas... They have a fatality rates way higher.

Well, no. Read up on the ""Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia"" and its role in the Bosnian war.  The Croats in Bosnia wanted to secede and join Croatia and they were armed and funded by the Croatian government. 

I see a lot of people talking about how  the scars of war are still visible in Mostar and post links on the bombing of the Mostar bridge. Well, Mostar was in the center of the Bosniak-Croat conflict and the Mostar bridge was actually destroyed by Croat rebels, not Serbs. Serbs didn't even attack Mostar to my knowledge.

I don't know how to respond to the rest, since I never disputed that ""Serbia"" (although I'd add that the correct term is Yugoslavia, since Serbia wasn't the country's name until  2006) is an aggressor.

Heavier restrictions - city parks were closed off, people are not allowed to go the go to the mountain either. Restaurant delivery and some mom and pop clothing stores are open. 

Government extended state of emergency to 13 of may. Minister of health uses the opportunity to sign 93M contract for finishing frozen hospital build. The building project to be used was started 40 years ago(not a typo). The hospital is expected to be finished within the next 3 years. 
Parliament is voting on 5B deficit. The country was running 0.75B surplus before lockdown.

No financial support for privet citizens and companies (8% of the companies were willing to use the government proposed stimulus package).
40k unemployed since lockdown to add to the 200k prior (~4M in working age).

The ruling party has been in charge in one form or another since 2009. I don’t see much use of state of emergency besides continuing corruption practices and suppress the longstanding social unrest.

Its the opposite mate. Go and take a look at rally cars and their tires.

A narrow tire will be able to dig down and grip better on snow and ice. Only time you would want to remove air and have a really really wide tire with low amount of air in is if you are driving on snow so deep than you risk sinking into it and getting stuck.

I'm not sure how sales of something like that were regulated- possibly the company stayed small enough to be the type of private enterprise that was still allowed.

There were also specialist racing cars built, like the [ZiL-112](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIL-112_Sports) or the [Stratopolonez](https://www.carsguide.com.au/oversteer/rushin-motors-stratopolonez-59187), but I think those stayed property of the factory and weren't used on the roads.

2447,"&gt;So, normally... When you lay siege to a city, you expect there to be some kind of conflict between two militairies. But in this case it was the military surrounding and starving out civillians.

But there was a conflict between two militaries, VRS and ArBiH. Think about what you're saying here. If there were only civilians inside Sarajevo, there wouldn't be a siege, the city would be simply taken. 

The Serb forces pinned down a numerically superior ArBiH force inside and around Sarajevo. The advantageous position made it possible for the VRS to use its superiority in heavy weapons, while at the same time neutering the advantage in numbers that ArBiH forces had. Militarily, this makes perfect sense. 

Of course, civilians suffered heavily, but majority of casualties were suffered by the ArBiH.",,/r/europe/comments/fv9emd/on_this_day_in_1992_the_siege_of_sarajevo_began/fmhmeqo/,ProfessionalCollar3,1586086181

Second, I already told you they're pumping up the numbers, and you should know that if you know a person working in the medical sphere.   


Third you contradicted yourself by saying 

&gt;  On top of that the tests already show that probably most of the population already got the virus on the first wave (they think it actually started in december, where we had spikes in flu). 

So if most of the population already go it... what's the point of the quarantine?

Then 

&gt; Queues of coffins out of Bergamo but of course they're lying to us and the only reason is to take away our freedom. 

Is it true all the patients are from direct COVID-19 deaths? Like the virus actually brought their organism to shut down and die? The same number of people die anyway.  
Also how do you know the coffin are littered with COVID-19 diseased corpses? Things like this sometimes come out as lies and the media says ""whopsie"" and everyone brushes it off. 

I'm just trying to make logical sense of this. Be extremely critical of everything you see. What my mom sees is medical staff, NOT wearing masks, some get sick, some don't. Those who get sick go home for 14 days then come back to work. And these are 30-50 years old medical staff. Now should I trust this and what I'm seeing or the news?

2500,"&gt;Over the last few years they have stationed mid range ballistic missiles in Kaliningrad that can be equipped with nuclear warheads

There have been mid-range ballistic missiles there stationed since the 60s and those were armed with nothing but nuclear warheads

Ones stationed there now are short range missiles not mid range and they don't have nuclear warheads installed at this time

So you already have what you are asking for, no mid-range ballistic missiles and even short range ones only have conventional warheads

So Merry Christmas and Happy Birthday to you my friend, enjoy present you asked for 

&gt;nd no, Kaliningrad is not ""the Russian mainland""

It's their national territory with all accompanying rules in effect, it could be in the middle of Pacific and nothing would change

Or do you think that Falklands are not UK territory as well?

&gt;It's only 250km away from Warsaw and 500km from Berlin

And Warsaw is only 250km from Kaliningrad and Berlin is 500km away

What should be done about that?

&gt;As far as I remember NATO hasn't stationed midrange ballistic missiles in Estonia or Latvia

Nope, only in Poland and Romania (Aegis)

Also, Estonia is just 250km from St Petersburg, imagine that? How did they get there so suddenly?

Here it is: at current prices without budget tweaks and using 150 billion of funds earmarked for that (of total trillion dollars reserves they have) Russia can do 6 years in current oil market

They just modified adjusted budget in order to do 10 years

Saudi Arabia is torched in 4 years or less, they have less money in the bank and unlike Russia they have no economy or industry other than oil (no agriculture as well)

2750,"&gt; EU migration has no influence at all on welfare, collective bargaining and wage equality policies.

Everyone has the right to free movement. That means that, say, a Romanian company can send its employees abroad without even needing any paperwork.

That in turn means businesses in the UK (before they left at least) can hire Romanians via a Romanian agency, and pay them the Romanian minimum wage (which is 1/3rd of the British minimum wage), since *technically* they're employed in Romania, just contracted out, and so Romanian labour laws apply. Legally speaking it's the same as outsourcing, except you bring the labour in instead of send the work out.

You fundamentally cannot stop this without getting rid of either the free movement of people or the free movement of services.

Of course, this basically abolishes a century's worth of worker's rights in the Western countries, which I think was part of the plan. But it's even worse: it makes it *legally impossible* for Westerners to compete with the Eastern Europeans - even if you were willing to take an €3/hr job, it's illegal for them to pay you that little because it's below the minimum wage. 

Everyone seems to forget it nowadays, but the EU always has been a neoliberal project, and up until a decade ago the left hated it for it. Up until at least the mid-2000s it was the right wing campaigning in favour of more integration.

Nowadays the left loves it for being anti-nationalist and and it's the right that hates it, for the same reason, but it's really not that long ago that it was about economics and the stances were reversed. As for Corbyn, I think he was still on the old program.

For instance Wursterreich (playing on Österreich) comes up 110 times on Google and 7 on Twitter. ’United Kingdump’ comes up unambiguously 10 times on Twitter, 9 times on Google (including one Disunited Kingdump and one tweet).

To be sure a name is really used in the context of a country, the country name itself was included in the search, for example ‘Luxy’ and ‘Luxembourg/Luxemburg’, then the minus sign - was used to remove other unwanted instances if they came up, like in this case instances merely relating to Radio Luxembourg. So a Twitter search of Luxy + Luxembourg/Luxemburg -radio, then removing adjectival uses (‘Luxy Luxembourg’) or pet names - gives 23 positive hits in English.

2817,"&gt;It is absolutely hilarious to see how blatantly hypocritical people are.

If Europe can't order medical gear from elsewhere then obviously we're now forced to keep the few things actually produced in Europe for ourselves. Otherwise we'll just have nothing at all.

Europe isn't a big producer of most things anymore so if we have to keep goods flowing freely, it has to be done by *everyone* on the planet for it to work. We can only export things as long as we can also import things, otherwise we just have nothing for ourselves at all.

I actually think EU is against having to make these restrictions as they have some really staunch globalists in their ranks, it's just that you can be forced to do something you don't like due to circumstances. Then your ideological or political leanings really don't matter anymore. If it a choice between sticking to your globalist ideology and thus letting your own people potentially die, or saving your own people by putting your own ideological view to the side, most people just don't see that as a difficult choice to make.

It even points to the problem in the article:

&gt;And now that supply has been put on hold because the EU and dozens of other countries around the world have either restricted or banned the export of medical equipment in an effort to protect their own supplies during this pandemic.

EU didn't just come up with this idea to be mean, they did it as a response to make sure that EU wouldn't end up without *any* medical gear.


&gt;GONZALEZ: So let me start by saying that there are over 54 governments across the world that have reportedly taken steps to ban or otherwise limit their exports of medical equipment, such as face masks and medicines and their ingredients. This is something that is very serious because world experts of medical products and medical gear are highly concentrated. For example, the top ten exporters account for almost three-quarters of world exports of medical products.

... 

&gt;GONZALEZ: So if two or three or four of these countries decide to put in an export ban, well, then many people around the world will not have access to these vital supplies.

...

&gt;GONZALEZ: Well, export restrictions are detrimental to exporting countries in at least three ways. First, they tend to increase prices because they disincentivize production. Second, they basically invite for retaliation from other countries. And third, because there is no single country in the world that is able to produce all the medical products and gear that are required to fight COVID-19. So at the end of the day, imposing restrictions on one or several products may lead to this country actually not having access to other vital supplies as well.


And that's exactly what is now happening. EU has no choice, no matter how globalist they otherwise are at times, because EU's access to products has been restricted. Clearly they're not going to accept that EU just has *zero* medical gear because it's all been exported, when EU can't import other stuff. If the US (as an example) won't export medical gear to EU, then EU basically has no choice but to retaliate or they'll just end up with no medical gear at all. They're never going to allow ""the free market"" to dictate if Europeans are to die or not, like if the USA would be willing to pay more for European medical gear than some of the poorer European countries.

I think (and hope) that this virus outbreak will be a lesson for a lot of countries. If things like trade deals, laws and regulations for exports etc. aren't respected during a crisis, then clearly we can't depend on it for emergency equipment, medicine etc. We can still let luxury items, toys and stuff be produced elsewhere obviously as they aren't really *required* during a crisis so we can live without them for a while, but when it comes to things like medical equipment etc. we need to be able to produce our own.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/fv22no/european_union_restricts_export_of_medical_gear/fmgu4f3/,Dnarg,1586057885

2944,"Mobile Providers in the UK are reporting a reduction in traffic on their networks as people are staying home and using their home broadband instead of their mobile data. This probably means mobile providers can give some extra data out without being concerned about over utilisation.

You are right that bandwidth isn't something that needs to be ""conserved"", the problem is a more localised one. For each phone mast, there is a certain amount of mobile spectrum each mobile provider has. This means each mast can only satisfy so much simultaneous usage. Data caps are a way to make people use less data and thereby reduce the load on these pinch points.

To give an example, my mobile data used to drop out when I walked in a specific part of the town centre. The mast was completely over utilised and they hadn't been able to build extra masts to spread the demand out.

Because we are talking about biological sex so it should be based on - surprise surprise - BIOLOGY, and not on self identity.

Otherwise - how exaclty is biological sex if it's not rooted in biology?

and what is the difference between se and gender? You avoided last time this question. I want to know the difference. If they are two different things then there should be diiferences.

Those are genetic diseases. Sometimes people are born without 1 or 2 arms, but it's due to a genetic disorder, you can't say that humans have no arms, have one arm or have two arms. No, humans have always two arms, unless they have a genetic disorder.

Yes, there are gypsies, but there are also plenty of Romanians pickpocketing, breaking into houses etc.

And the reason why gypsies are doing this shit ? Because the Romanian authorities allowed them to keep living semi-nomadic lives. Because in Romania the police is taking bribes from them and protecting them instead of the citizen, so you're afraid to go against them.

Fane Spoitoru (Romanian gypsy equivalent of Al Capone) had the minister of internal affairs as a main guest for his son's baptism. J Edgar Hoover (or any FBI head) being the main guest at a party for the baptism of Al Capone's son.

The Romanian authorities are at least as guilty as the gypsies themselves.

3049,"In Germany it's more common to be a tenant while in countries like Spain, owning your home is relatively more common.

So on paper, the average Spaniard (plus their partner if any) will have a home that is valued in some hundreds of thousands euros (75k to 350k mignt be the most common range), and depending on the age, that spaniard will be reducing the mortgage month by month until the person is in their 50s-60s (usually people set the mortgage payments up to when the person has 70 yo as that's the maximum banks use to allow, but, but it's common to invest the savings in early repayments).
It's relatively normal to switch homes once or twice in life by selling the old one and buying a new one of a higher value.

On the other hand, the average German will rent the place in which they live. 

Each have their advantages and disadvantages, the monthly payments that an average German makes into their homes is considered a spending while for that average Spaniard it's an investment, as after some time, the house will be fully paid but this isn't a huge difference, at least until later in life when the Spaniard won't have to pay any rent, as the Spaniard cannot make that wealth into cash, or at least easily, and usually a Spaniard would have way less savings in cash as it often makes more sense so use the savings to repay the mortgage.

This is also the reason behind the great difference between mean and and median wealth in Germany, as rented houses still belong to somebody.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/fuipou/list_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult/fmg8fx2/,orikote,1586043467

3119,"Building durable good relations is superior at protecting the Baltics than trying to maintain a constantly hostile situation through power balance. This is a fact. So let's try to think of the future instead of being stuck in a ""Russia bad"" mindset.

I want a durable solution to the problem, not a weak maintaining of the problem. Especially because NATO's ability to protect the Baltics is somewhat questionable. In my view, a ""Russia = enemy"" mindset endangers those countries far more than the trajectory towards an alliance does.

People who are ignorant of the present-day Russian threat are naive. Those who have a long-term desire to establish a friendly relationship have vision. Long term vision and naivety are not the same thing. Right now I think the Russian threat needs to be addressed by NATO. But simultaneously we should not only be thinking about how to contain the threat, but also how to diminish it or even take it away completely by building a better relationship with Russia.

You're just the guy who would be anti-German in the early to mid 20th century, viewing them as the ""enemy"" and believing an alliance to be impossible. _That_ is what I call ignorance, not those that built towards a better future for Europe by bringing us all together. The same mindset is needed for Russia and you know what? We were actually well underway to getting there with the relations before 2014.

Yes, we can get back to those much more amicable relations and yes we can go even further on that. Thing is... this is fundamentally against US interests.

Yeah, sorry but that train has left the station a long time ago. The strategy now is basically to slow down the spread as much as possible so that the healthcare system doesn’t spectacularly collapse on itself and we all get thrown back into the dark ages. In the end there are only a few possible outcomes:

1.	The virus continues to spread until a majority of the population has already been infected. At that point the virus will slow down naturally, because chances are the people with which an infected person comes into contact with are either infected themselves or have been in the past, thus they are immune. 
2.	A vaccine becomes available, a majority of people get vaccinated and the virus is eradicated. 
3.	an effective cure/treatment appears, thus the disease is no longer life threatening.

Of course, there is also the chance of the virus mutating and being able to reinfect recovered people, in which case we’re just royally fucked.",,/r/europe/comments/fusm8t/as_northern_italy_is_ravaged_by_coronavirus/fmfj9rl/,crocodilau,1586028415

That would be positive

We aren't talking about lethality rate here. We are talking about *number* of daily deaths.

If a country has incredible infrastrutcture, healthcare-wise, that means they can afford to be more lax in their quarantine measures, thus sparing the economy, as even the more serious cases will never be at risk of being not taken care of. 

Countries with more fragile healthcare systems and more limited resources need to apply more drastic measures as soon as possible, otherwise they run the risk of going the Italian and Spanish way and losing control of the pandemic and collapsing their health systems. In those cases, the economy is going to be doomed anyway.

For instance, Portugal closed their borders relatively early on (although a lot of people already feel it was too late) and the situation is - as of today (04/Apr) - still fairly manageable, compared to a lot of other countries.

It's logic that you trust your officials before the Spanish officials... I will logically do the same. Let the time pass and the fog dissipate. 

The thing is we are dying by thousands, our grandmas, grandparents, and relatives, and respirators have been sitting in customs for more than 2 weeks just because Turkey officials did not allow an exception even when the Spanish government is asking directly, as said by the own government. At least, if these respirators were being used in a Turkish hospital we could have some kind of relief, but they are just gathering dust and our own people are dying. It's definitely not a good image for Turkey... And I know France did the same with 2 million masks, but in less than a week these masks were already in Spanish hospitals and we hold absolutely 0 grudges to France for that. We understand than in Crisis time sometimes wrong measures are taken, but the importance is how quickly we can surpass these wrong measures.

If you think that we don't know that the first guilty is our own government you know nothing about Spanish people.  Heads will roll here, people are absolutely infuriated about how our own government had managed the things.

But we also can see how countries that we believed were our allies behave. Portugal has been a great ally, like Italy, czech republic or some other countries.

Well when religion was brought into it you felt the need to clarify that sometimes children do just miraculously happen to believe the same things as their parents. 

Parents clearly raise their children a certain way to believe and act certain ways. I don't think many religous families ask their children if they want to go to church, to pray, to celebrate a religous holiday, to get baptised, to believe in that religion, etc. And they're even less likely to teach them to question that religion or not believe in it. They just get their children to do it.

Their messsage:

Legislation, regulations and airline fares and conditions have been developed only in anticipation of relatively localised and short-term disruptions. No text envisaged the bans and travel restrictions imposed on travellers in recent weeks around the world as a result of the coronavirus/COVID-19 crisis. These have resulted in massive numbers of flight cancellations.

&amp;#x200B;

Faced with the exceptional circumstances created by the coronavirus/COVID-19 crisis, Air France and KLM believe that the issuance of a refundable voucher constitutes a fair solution and a reasonable balance between the protection of passengers’ rights and the operational realities that every airline has to face.

&amp;#x200B;

Our aim is by no means to deprive our passengers of their existing rights. However, when flights have to be cancelled because of today’s unique circumstances with global border closures and restrictions on free movement which prevent passengers from reaching their airports of departure, the issuance of these vouchers enables us to provide passengers more flexibility and choice during a period of uncertainty. In addition, the vouchers are refundable after 12 months if unused, by which time we should have resumed our full schedule. Where refundable tickets have been booked, refunds in accordance with fare conditions are of course provided.

&amp;#x200B;

Several major governments around the world have indicated that such an approach is appropriate in the current context, provided that such vouchers do not expire in an unreasonably short period of time and that a refund of the voucher can be made after one year if it is not used.

3492,"&gt;Most people would not care and the government would at most be perplexed at why the EU would choose to call it by its swedish name(=official translation).

That's what Poles feel every time someone who is not German uses ""Danzig"" name.

It's not like we beat people for that, but we simply don't like it, it makes us feel uncomfortable.

&gt;The whole Gdansk thing is a whole different thing, because I'm assuming Gdansk doesn't translate to that.

But it does, Gdansk was the original city's name. ""Danzig"" is just a germanized version of this name, Germans couldn't spell ""Gd"" and ""nsk"" clusters so they used approximate spelling, you can even see a gradual evolution of this name in writing:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk#Names

&gt;The name of a settlement was recorded after St. Adalbert's death in AD 997 as urbs Gyddanyzc[9] and it was later written as Kdanzk in 1148, Gdanzc in 1188, Danceke[10] in 1228, Gdansk in 1236,[11] Danzc in 1263, Danczk in 1311,[12] Danczik in 1399,[9][13] Danczig in 1414,

The first name ""Gyddanyzc"" sounds almost exactly ""Gdańsk"" given the limitations of the usage of Latin alphabet for Slavic languages and medieval Latin spelling (""y"" was a softening, ""z"" was like today's ""s"" and ""c"" was pronounced like ""k"" - so you get something like G'ddan'sk). ""Danzig"" is late germanization of the name.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/fuqfyt/not_all_heroes_wear_capes_warsaw/fmewcch/,Spin53,1586014948

&gt;We probably spread the infection throughout the hospital, and worst of all, we bring it to our own homes, stores. Patients from other wards are freely admitted and discharged, contributing to the spread of the epidemic - wrote in a letter to Onet a doctor of the city hospital in Toruń, in which 22 coronavirus infections of patients and staff were detected.

&gt;Letter - beginning:  
&gt;  
&gt;I am writing to you because the level of absurdity, disorganization, neglect and hypocrisy in our hospital already exceeds all limits. (...) The epidemic problem does not only concern this ward.  1. Infected employees of the hematology ward have been in contact with most people working in the hospital for many days because they had no idea about a raging infection in their ward. Many doctors from other departments consulted patients in the hematology ward, exposing themselves to infection. However, only the entire staff and all patients from the hematology ward and several patients from other wards had tests for coronavirus. In the current situation, it is not possible for the virus not to spread to the entire hospital, but we do not know it, because no one wants to do tests for us! 2. The director of hospital treatment on March 30-31 visited all departments, instructing the staff not to use face masks or visors in the hospital, especially in the emergency room! We were waiting for arguments ourselves, unable to believe what we hear. And we heard: ""the mask does not protect against anything"", ""lower personnel see you wear masks and helmets and also demand protective equipment"", ""from an economic point of view this is completely unjustified."" I will mention that the director is a doctor.  3. In several departments there are patients suspected of COVID-19 or there are doctors and other personnel from direct contact with infected hematology doctors (this applies to cardiology, urology, surgery). Doctors from the so-called of contact, they work unhindered in the ward with other doctors, nurses, examine patients. \[...\]

\- For years, the healthcare system in Poland has been glued to adhesive tape. It didn't bother anyone that one doctor works three times. Everyone liked it, because in this way they tried to cover staff shortages. What were the hospital directors supposed to do in the case of staffing and financial shortages? - dr Łukasz Jankowski from the District Medical Chamber in Warsaw asked rhetorically in ""Yes it is"" on TVN24.  Now - as he estimates - in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, it can no longer function.  - Any exceeding of procedures ends in a trace of infection. That is, more infected hospital employees and patients. Health service managers in this situation reach for unacceptable measures, for gagging us. There are more bans on speaking out - the TVN24 guest emphasized.  He referred in this way, inter alia, to the letter of the Ministry of Health of 20 March, sent by the Ministry of Health to national consultants. They were obliged to oblige provincial consultants not to issue opinions on the COVID-19 epidemic.  - The very fact that the ministry is sending a letter asking them not to speak or speak about guidelines because of the ""coherence of the narrative"" is a clear signal that something is really wrong - emphasized Dr. Jankowski. \[...\]

3601," Berlin’s drug dealers adapt to life under coronavirus lockdown Vendors face a shifting landscape as supply routes close and users’ habits change  

 From the appropriate social distance, Dave offers cheery advice to a customer stocking up on ketamine as the lockdown in Germany’s capital Berlin begins to bite. “When you think a little more would be nice, go the hell ahead and have another bump!” he said, indifferent to nearby police officers. “Whatever feels good. Just go gently.” 

Around the world, it is not just legal businesses that are being transformed by the coronavirus pandemic. From “corona specials” to personalised delivery services, drug dealers are hustling to keep business flowing, suppliers are scrambling to find new routes as transport closes down and promoters are flouting the ban on groups by holding underground raves.

 In Berlin, a city famed for its hedonistic nightlife and techno clubs like Berghain, dealers such as Dave are adapting to serve the large number of clubbers who find themselves stuck at home with little to do but get high. 

Social distancing and restrictions on movement have also spurred stockpiling, with the price of some drugs rising sharply. “People are panicking, and not just about toilet paper,” said Lucy, who deals cannabis to her private customer base. “Right now I’m selling 500 grammes a day — before I would normally sell about 100 grammes.” Like all the dealers quoted in this article, she asked to be identified by her street name. 

Jack, another private dealer, just received his biggest ever single order, worth €1,500. Preferences have not changed, he said — ketamine, an anaesthetic sold on the streets for its trance-inducing effects, and speed are still his top sellers. 

Many of his orders have doubled, and even tripled, in size. Dealers see trouble ahead, however. Lucy’s supply chain through Spain, badly hit by the pandemic, has been completely shut down. Illicit trade experts say it is inevitable that the black market would take a temporary hit. 

But drug traffickers have an advantage on legitimate businesses: “They are used to seeing distortions in supply chains caused by law enforcement, for example, or perhaps a particular airport detecting goods and cargo, and having to adapt,” said Jason Eligh, a senior expert at the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime.

 As restrictions on air travel are tightened, dealers say they are eyeing more routes by land and sea, hiding their product amid legally traded goods. 

One dealer of Lebanese hashish said he expected his partners would try to smuggle the resin in among medical supplies. “They will find a way — they always do,” he said. 

It will reach a time when drug dealers are delivering your daily, weekly, or monthly hit via a drone to your windowsill Vanda Felbab-Brown, Brookings Institution 

In Berlin’s Görlitzer Park, home to a notorious drug market, trade in illegal substances continues despite the lockdown. 

During a recent visit by the Financial Times, police could be seen searching vans on one side of the park, while at the other end, crowds of dealers — many wearing face masks and gloves — hawked their wares as usual. “We’re afraid, too, man, for ourselves and our families. 

And we’re worried about the borders — prices are going to go up,” said one dealer. “But for you — I’ll give you a special price.”

 Experts say talk of prices rising should be taken with a pinch of salt — it takes months for effects on supply to filter thought to street level, and some traffickers are just exploiting the crisis to gouge prices. 

Berlin’s dealers who once sold cannabis for €10 a gramme can now charge €15-30. Regardless, trafficking analysts expect the coronavirus crisis will have a lasting impact on the drugs trade, from the development of new routes and partnerships, to the potential rise of organisations that better exploit the crisis.

 Vanda Felbab-Brown, an illicit trade expert at the Brookings Institution, said she expected a push into automated transport — just as it may be for legal businesses. “Amazon and others will be delivering groceries via drone to your doorstep, and in a similar way we will reach a time when drug dealers are delivering your daily, weekly, or monthly hit via a drone to your windowsill,” she said. 

Jack, the dealer, predicted growing use of the “dark web” of the internet — where drugs can be posted for delivery to anonymous addresses. In the short term, the disruptions caused by the virus could be deadly. 

Europol has warned that increased competition may spark violence, as groups compete for transportation access, as well as supplies needed to make drugs such as the synthetic opioid Fentanyl, which requires “precursor” chemicals from India or China that are running low.

 The adaptations have a cuddlier face in Berlin. On private channels in WhatsApp and Telegram, dealers assure their customers that their goods were packed with latex gloves. One dealer urged buyers to think of the health of his couriers: “Please everyone — hand disinfection! Stay healthy and watch out for yourselves.” 

 Lucy’s clients now ask for their drugs to be delivered to their homes, in order to maintain quarantine. 

Some customers refuse to buy from her Asian couriers, out of racist beliefs they are more likely to carry the virus. “People are getting a little crazy,” she said. 

There is a class element to how coronavirus will impact drug usage. Mr Eligh, of the Global Initiative, said that while wealthier customers can use at home, poorer addicts may continue to congregate as they look for places to take their drugs, and are more likely to be overlooked by health initiatives. “You are going to see the poorest in society far more affected than the upper middle-class and the wealthy,” he said.

While some are neglected, others are going off grid on purpose. 

For Berliners in the know, an underground scene continues to rage, replete with full bars, lighting and DJ sets. The raves are held in warehouses and remote apartments, dealers say, with the events co-ordinated via secret chat groups that alert people of the time and place the night before.

 Pre-paid tickets can cost up to €100 each and special lookouts are hired to watch out for police. “DJs, promoters: they all still want to make money during this,” said Dave. “There was a big warehouse party last night — I’ve got a couple of mates who went and I haven’t heard back from them yet. They’re probably still going.”",Germany,/r/europe/comments/furg8a/berlins_drug_dealers_adapt_to_life_under/fmed0em/,Hematophagian,1585999368

I don't see a reason why the EU is more prone to fail than a year ago. Sure, the ensuing economic crisis will flatten a lot of things and will make the GFC look like a fucking picnic in the park, but that will hold true for every country on the globe. 

There will be national tensions in countries where Covid-19 was particularly deadly and politicians will have to explain why the health system didn't cope while other nations had lower lethality rates, higher testing rates, etc. (E.g. Some UK hospitals have sent testing kits to Germany as they manage to get result 2 days earlier than the labs in the UK).

And centre-right politicians in the Netherlands and other countries,  including possibly Germany risk never being able to be elected again if they let that happen because it would empower the more radical rightwing parties in their countries. It might not put those far right parties into power (they will probably remain too small for that), but if they end up taking 50% of the votes of the right and possibly the center, the rightwing politicians cannot get elected again. In that respect this is like Brexit. The Conservative leadership didn't really want a referendum. There was not a risk of UKIP taking over the government. But there was a risk UKIP could get so big that the Labour party would easily surpass the Tories. So the Tories felt forced to call a referendum. Now the dynamics might be different in the Netherlands and Germany because the electoral system is very different from the UK. But the principle stands. We have seen it with immigration policy, in the Netherlands and Denmark. Why do you think it went so far right? Because the rightwing (and in Denmark even the Social Democrats) felt it was necessary to keep their electoral viability. I think you have no idea how bad a transfer union polls in Northern Europe.

He tried to, but apparently Russia, Austria, Prussia and the UK weren't too fond of the idea. Each time Napoleon defeated a coalition and made a peace treaty, the UK went into full anti-Napoleon diplomacy mode with the other powers and offered them a lot of money to re-start the wars. And each time Napoleon beat them again, until he made the fateful decision to invade Russia.

It has also to be noted that Napoleon was very light-handed in the conditions he imposed his defeated foes. He re-structured the HRE into the Confederation of the Rhine (which was actually good for Germany, as it prefigured the German unification that would come a few decades later), took Dalmatia, and placed his family at the head of several kingdoms, but didn't go much further than that.

They were not produced in germany. They were produced in singapore.

&gt;what right has the US here? 3M may be an American company, but most likely the producing plant is registered as a Chinese company.

3M's foreign facilities and daughter companies still belong to them as long as the countries that actually have jurisdiction don't get fed up enough with the Trump admin's behavior to start nationalizing factories.

4081,"&gt; Not to say that they're beyond criticism, but why does Reddit seem to have such a hate-boner for America?

Propagandists are taking advantage of the inherent insecurity and anti-Americanism in Canadians and Europeans, and are making them focus ALL of their negative attention on the US even though the crisis was caused by China and is much worse in Europe right now than the US. Anti-Americanism is a mental disorder and China and Russia can very easily create false narratives by catering to preexisting anti-American tropes. Part of this is in hopes that US influence will wane and Russia and China can fill the vacuum. 

But people in power in Canada and Europe benefit from this too, they have an interest in keeping their people focusing their scorn on the US... so that the governments and institutions in their own countries get less criticism and won't be held to account by public perception for any failings or inadequacies. 

It's very easy to distract people from their own problems and the misdeeds of their own governments by creating hysteria about the US. People are already programmed to have a heightened sense of interest in any story that involves the US. Make it a negative story and most Canadians and Europeans will accept it instantly without any scrutiny.

&gt;Leopold was the founder and sole owner of the [Congo Free State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State), a private project undertaken on his own behalf. (...) At the [Berlin Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Conference)  of 1884–1885, the colonial nations of Europe authorized his claim by  committing the Congo Free State to improving the lives of the native  inhabitants. Leopold ignored these conditions and ran the Congo using  the mercenary [Force Publique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Publique) for his personal gain. He extracted a fortune from the territory, initially by the collection of [ivory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory), and after a rise in the price of [rubber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber)  in the 1890s, by forced labour from the native population to harvest  and process rubber. He used great sums of the money from this  exploitation for public and private construction projects in Belgium  during this period. He donated the private buildings to the state before  his death, to preserve them for Belgium.   
&gt;  
&gt;Leopold's administration of the Congo was characterised by murder, torture, and [atrocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrocities_in_the_Congo_Free_State),  resulting from notorious systematic brutality. **The hands of men, women,  and children were amputated when the quota of rubber was not met.**",,/r/europe/comments/fudd1e/turkey_requisitions_spains_respirators_for_its/fmdehx2/,aknb,1585965797

4224," Ottoman Empire conquered Constantinople at 1453 which was basically the capital city of Europe and Christianity and Turkey still has that city by the name of 'Istanbul'. Turkey owned a respectable amount of European soil when Ottoman Empire was a thing and had a cultural influence on that soils. Turkey's European side has more population than most of the Balkan countries or some of the Europe's countries. Ottomans has a heavy influence on European culture and history and soil so Turkey should be considered European. Believing in a different religion should not be the reason why Turkey isnt European because there are countries that majority of the population believe the same religion as Turkey and still considered as European in Europe. If you look at the major cities in Turkey like Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Antalya and such these cities are more developed in categories such as infrastructure, cleanless, safety and more well maintained and tidyness than most of the Eastern European country's major cities and Istanbul could be one of the best in infrastructure in Europe and safer than London and Paris.

Context : Since the start of the pandemic ( 3rd of march ), the Republic has order a requisition of the existing stock in France and deployed a control of all exports while basically outlawing price gauging for some Protection equipment on its territory.

Although the few French companies producing on the French territory have surprisingly not be nationalized ( despite being requested by part of the opposition) they have been integrated to the national effort, with specific derogations and help, aimed at ramping up their production.

Nb. As acknowledge by this Swedish company : ""The governments of most of EU countries in which we operate have restrictions in place"".

France has also been a vocal proponent of a coordination and a pooling of Europe's orders. It took unfortunately several weeks( almost a month now ) before it was even considered as an option by the EU commission.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Official position of the french government.

""**While the requisition measures are guided by the imperative to protect the French,** **the government has nevertheless reaffirmed its attachment to European solidarity and the need to take into account the allocation of the assets that have been requisitioned and allowing deliveries to be made to other Member States of the European Union**.

Under the principle of European solidarity, the government did authorized the Swedish company Mölnlycke Health Care to export the masks intended for Italy and Spain, which were stored on French territory. I am not sure if the part of those stocks that were meant for countries external to the EU  will ever be return to this company or authorized to leave france, I doubt it.

Basically, during this sanitary crisis, it seems only exports to other EU countries are authorized and those orders have to be checked and validated.

&gt; (Reuters) - A majority of voters in Northern Ireland would oppose the region leaving the United Kingdom to form a united Ireland if a referendum were held tomorrow, according to a poll published by the Belfast Telegraph newspaper on Tuesday.

&gt;Irish unity would be supported by just 29% of voters, with 52% against, the poll of 2,000 people organized by Liverpool University and Britain's Economic and Social Research Council found. The remaining 19% said they did not know how they would vote.

...

&gt; If 'don't knows' are excluded, the figures show 65% to 35% in favor of remaining within the United Kingdom, the survey showed.

4372,"Yes, I did notice how high tickets cost. I didn't have a BahnKarte or anything, but still. Salaries/wage is higher in USA, so if I thought it was expensive Germans who probably make less than I do must think it is really expensive. I can see how small delays really fuck things up, especially when you have to do changes on low frequency routes. One thing I did notice though was that FlixTrain is apparently now a thing and their tickets were comparatively cheap. I guess if DB is now privatized, it can't hurt to have competition.

I think we in USA can do much better with rail, but it would look a lot different than it does in Germany. Amtrak, our train provider, needs to focus on mid distance corridors between large population centers, not these slow massive trans-continental passenger routes that stop in every other town that nobody uses.

In my state of North Carolina for example, a fast train with decent frequency between Raleigh and Charlotte would make a lot of sense as a lot of people drive that route every day and the road is overloaded. There are a lot of good examples of routes like this that could be made. Atlanta to Charlotte, Dallas to San Antonio, Jacksonville to Miami, etc. However, states are going to be reluctant to do this after seeing the fiasco in California with the SF to LA high speed train.

nope. It's some press fearing they might get restricted - there were several indictments indeed (even before the rule by decree) like the guy who launched the rumour on FB that two days from now Budapest will be locked down.

Search google for ""sputnik sweden"", enter the site to find their articles tagged with Sweden. Take a look at the first 15-30 headlines (ignore the corona related stuff)

Common theme is calling out Swedish wishful thinking, incompetency, exaggerating the problems we have. Is Sputnik, in your opinion, telling us to man up and get real, or are they shoving it in our face to demoralize us? These kinds of articles are commonly called out in Sweden as propaganda and the narratives within have a way of seeping into twitter feeds, internet forums and facebook groups.

I'm not going to argue Swedish media isn't antagonistic toward Russia, it is. The historical enemy archetype is true, as well as more recent history with the Finnish winter war and the cold war. A lot of distrust comes from that. And consider the current geopolitical situation (EU, NATO, Russia) - any relationship between our countries occurs in that environment. Also alot of prominent media figures and politicians, as you probably know, are tied to the American establishment - they are ""liberal imperialists"" in regard to foreign policy, for better or worse.

Turkish support of the government is greatly exaggerated. It's the classic tale that's happening in many countries, even in ""developed"" ones like US and UK.

Also the ruling party lost all the large cities, including Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir, in the last election. This means even the idiot fucks are giving up on them.

On the other hand, I'm Turkish and I agree that most people here are idiot fucks. But if you ask a democrat in US, they'll say most people there are idiots as well, and any Remain supporter from UK will agree to the same thing in their own country.

Holding Turkish people accountable will not do any good to anyone, because anyone who disagrees with the government here are already aware of the atrocities, and anyone who supports the government will just unite under the ""europe hates us"" umbrella that's keeping their unity alive.",,/r/europe/comments/fudd1e/turkey_requisitions_spains_respirators_for_its/fmconh9/,TripplerX,1585949743

The EU was an easy target because it acted as a passive punching bag. China have spent decades slowly destroying our countries and yet people respect them more than the EU. Hell, most people still defend China now despite what they've done this year. Because they're ruthless bastards and people can't help but respect that.

Why do you think Russia, an economic dwarf in comparison to the EU, still retain so much influence and power in global politics? Many countries absolutely despise their warmongering ways, but Russia have a strong position in the world as a whole because of their strength and their willingness to not play by any rules. 

The EU should stick to just being a trade bloc if it doesn't want to become a fully fledged federation or empire.

4506,"The Chinese regime is overly distrustable and I'll always take their numbers with a 200kg grain of salt, but unlike Western countries, China (and pretty much all Asian countries -- something many people seem to conveniently forget) took harsh and sensible measures early on to contain contaminations. 

Being a police state, China went the furthest, forced a **complete ban** on movements, and massively isolated cases. Other Asian countries diligently isolated everybody in contact with every single case being discovered, as fast as they could. They all have had to deal with epidemics in the last decades, and have learned from it.

Western countries? They waited. Then waited some more. Then as warnings upon warnings piled up, they took cheap and minimal measures. And [waited again](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/opinion/china-response-china.html), for good measure. By the time we reached the point of no return, it was too late and general confinement ended up being the only solution to prevent our medical infrastructures from being overwhelmed over the course of a single month.

&amp;nbsp;

So yeah, I'm getting quite fed up too with the whole ""*China lied!*"" narrative becoming ubiquitous on social medias, and even starting to leak here. There's something utterly arrogant and contemptuous in believing that if Western countries couldn't deal properly with it, China **shouldn't** be any different. That there **has** to be a catch. 

It's the 19th century Western self-satisfied mentality all over again, really.

I won't blame the West too much for being complacent: even if multiple warnings were issued, that's not something we were prepared for, socially, psychologically and institutionally. But self-criticism is certainly more constructive than gratuitous finger pointing.

4550,"&gt; because Daddy USA was the one behind Pinochet's rise to power 

Yes and no. The CIA wanted Allende gone. They didn't care about Pinochet personally. In fact, they prefered less controversial and ""more legal"" means, such as impeachment by Congress (which was actually starting by 1973 and had legal arguments). A local businessman, Agustín Edwards Eastman traveled to the US to meet with them and told them that centrist parties were spineless and that a coup was a better option among other stuff (including an attempt to pseudo-swindle the CIA), so they went by his opinion, but they also kept other options available. A lot of the coup was homebrewed, and it wasn't the first coup attempt at Allende either.

But the CIA never really controlled Pinochet, and he thought it was a great idea to make a car-bombing in Washington DC in 1976, which pissed off pretty much everyone, and got sanctioned, including military stuff, which he needed at the time.

Elliot Abrams didn't like Pinochet and suggested Reagan to pressure Pinochet for his removal. The pressure by the US made Pinochet make a referendum in 1988, which he lost and tried to make a self-coup, but his generals told him to fuck off and leave, because otherwise the US will have a big retribution against Chile.

Still though i fail to see how the QE makes problem for an economy with 240% private debt to GDP. 

Is this private debt being able to be served 100% or it is rolled over  taking advantage of the low interest rates that exist now because of QE? My bet is that it is rolled over as with 240% ratio the numbers simply do not add up, this is clearly unsustainable.

Plus having this huge private debt with low to no inflation makes this debt even bigger burden. This is because the mature debt will have the same real value for longer time. As an example, if i got a loan 20 years ago of lets say 100k, i could buy a house. Nowdays i need to get 200k to buy the same house but my salary is also more than doubled. Now to repay the old 100k debt with my salary doubled over time (thus inflation) is easier to repay my old debt. If there is no inflation and prices/salaries stay the same, you have to repay this enormous debt over time with the same income.

But in the areas our global interests don't align.... they're doing really damaging things. Things that make me question our entire relationship.

In the words of Tusk: ""With friends like this, who needs enemies?"", referring to the US.

&gt; Countries that invade European nations for land grabs and organize systematic disinformation and destabilization campaigns against democratic countries are not our enemies? 

Nope, because you have to look at *why* they (want to) do such things, instead of this simplistic ""they're literally evil"" narrative. Did Russia launch disinformation campaigns when the EU had ample trade with them and a generally amicable relationship? Or did that start after Ukraine? What you're essentially saying here is that no conditions exist under which we can ever be friendly with Russia, as their geopolitical interests are so fundamentally opposed to ours that they ought to be called our ""enemy"". I reject that. Right now there are clearly heavy tensions and Russia is absolutely not our friend, but this isn't set in stone. It's just the current situation.

By the way, by looking at why their goals are what they are, I don't mean to support them or state that the present Russian behaviour is justified by all kinds of reasons. It's just to show that the current relations are the result of certain events, not an essential element of what Russia is and always would have been. They aren't ""destined"" to be an opposing force, if you will. It's just the (temporary?) result of circumstances. 

In 2002 there was talk of Russia perhaps JOINING THE EU in the future, for fuck's sake. Russia's interests are not fundamentally opposed to ours, even if we are heavily opposed to one another right now. Thus, they're not our ""enemy"". 

Because they're not our enemy, what I want is policy that is aimed at fixing our relations, not policy that assumes we're mortal enemies or something.

And why I compared the US to China and Russia, even though we're ""allies"", is because I see the US as the current greatest obstacle to the EU fully representing its own interests in the global arena.",Utrecht (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/ftm870/rottner_president_of_the_french_region_grand_est/fmbjhij/,RegisEst,1585927597

Since bonds do not give a return and stocks and commodity assets are too volatile, we have seen a huge influx of both national and international investors in our real estate market driving prices up. Low rates mean a subsidy for asset owners over renters.

Jokes aside, I had good history professors but many didn’t. And as I’ve said in another comment, it’s routine to use the islands as part of some shit populist agenda. 

The islands were under Argentinian management for a very little time and it didn’t go well because of internal turmoil. All the while the British kept the islanders fed. And according to international law, our claims are long expired.

4686,"One of the very first things Pinochet did was to piss off the US. In 1974. Right after a year he got in power, the US sanctioned him.

The US did not care for Pinochet personally. They just wanted Allende out, and they saw that the best way was to legally impeach him, and in fact the Chilean Congress was starting the procedure (which had actual legal justifications, mind you). However, a local businessman, Agustín Edwards Eastman thought that Congress and centre parties were spineless cowards and that the best way was to make a coup, and personally went to the US to convince them of that.

But the CIA didn't really mind an impeachment or coup, as long as Allende got out. You can actually check their attitude in the Church Committee. They left the plotters organize it themselves and informed the CIA of their advances (while the CIA also wiretapped them), and the answer was pretty much ""k, you do you"".

Then you have that the CIA wasn't keen on Pinochet, because they were not fully controlling him and saw him as a wingnut because Pinochet did not fully stay in Chile, and a terrorist attack in Buenos Aires, but also a failed one in *Italy*, and the most idiotic was to make a car bombing in *Washington DC out of all freaking places*. This completely pissed off any support left he had in the US, and got sanctioned even more, completely halting all weapons and arms sales (including other stuff) in 1977.

Because US puppets go to commit car bombings in Washington Dc obviously.

Since Chile had not much in terms of weaponry, the Argentinian dictatorship in 1978 thought they could attack Chile and score a victory to distract the populace and increase their popularity. The first attack was stopped due to bad weather, and the Pope stepped in to negotiate peace.

Since their popularity was still faltering, they thought the UK was weak and could make a quick victory against them in 1982, and then take ""revenge"" on Chile. It was completely logical for Chile to support the UK, because it just came out of a very close-call fo war against Argentina, and they were beating the drums of war against Chile. In public. On TV.

Then you had that Argentina put many elite divisions around the Chilean border, and not in the Falklands, in which there was an actual war going on.

And then, you had that Reagan did not like Pinochet either. Elliot Abrams wanted him out. Yes, *that* Elliot Abrams. He pushed Reagan to make actions to pressure Pinochet to remove him, and made a referendum in 1988, in which he lost. Pinochet wanted to make a self-coup, but his generals told him to fuck off because otherwise the US retribution would have been huge, and Pinochet stepped down *because of US pressure*.",Chile,/r/europe/comments/fu0440/yesterday_marked_38_years_since_the_beginning_of/fmbkd7m/,CMuenzen,1585928086

He has the courts, he has the parliament, he has the constitutional and supreme courts, he has the prosecutors, he has the media and he has all the laws and voting districts benefiting his party. He can already declare an emergency and because he has a supermajority just extend it as many times as he wants. He could even rewrite or amend the constitution if he wanted. the populace is overwhelmingly pro-EU and he is comfortable with his position in being just as authoritarian as the EU will tolerate.

but yeah see absolutely no reason to make the emergency have no time limit, it just doesn't make sense. the opposition offered him to make it 3 months, and they would've given him even more time if he wanted, but they only agreed to indefinite, nothing else. does this make any sense to anyone?

the only thing I can think of that they have 2 representatives over the supermajority line, so they're being afraid that some of them might die. The other thing is that is pretty much 100% that the plan behind this bill was to frame the opposition as people who don't want to help the government in emergency.

the real power grab is that because they lost a lot of ground in the municipality elections last year, they're planning to strip powers of the municipalities and make everything more centralized, but this doesn't have a lot to do with the pandemic.",,/r/europe/comments/fu3vjj/hungary_joins_statement_criticising_hungarian/fmb7qx7/,YolognaiSwagetti,1585920494

This is incorrect.

Britain's first claim was 1766. France also settled there. France sold off it's port to the Spanish who later gave ti to Britain.

Britain then left the port due to needing it's ships for war elsewhere leaving a claim to the islands in place.

Argentina allowed a US business man to claim it saying it used to be Spanish so it's now theirs. Then they fell out kicked out the American and left a garrison there.

Had you asked a British citizen actually living in the British Isles to pin-point the Falklands on a map pre-1982 I'm pretty sure the vast majority of them wouldn't have been able to do it (or they would have placed it somewhere in the uninhabited desert of East Anglia). So, yes, pre-1982 Falklands were pretty much a non-issue for the UK, it's like they didn't exist. 

&gt; You do know that the Bayeux Tapestry depicts the Norman conquest of England, right

I was extrapolating the English history to the British history, that's why I was saying that the Welsh and Scots ""were damned"" (i.e. not part of it of British history). 

&gt; Wut? you seem very confused, why would we leave India because of penguins?

I don't know, that's for you Brits to answer. Why did you leave India and you didn't leave the Falklands? After all both of them were British territories with British people inhabiting there. I tried to make a comparison and I found out that Falklands did have penguins while India didn't, so I presumed that was the reason you left the poor Indians alone, with no benevolent UK people to rule over them.

&gt; According to Index, Fidesz contacted MSZP’s leadership and expressed their willingness to modify parts of the bill providing MSZP agreed to vote along with Fidesz in favor of restricting the placement of political advertisements outside of campaign season.

&gt; On Tuesday, MSZP’s executive board convened to discuss how to frame this narrative so that rather than coming across as a secret deal made behind closed doors, it would be perceived as an attempt by MSZP to carve out a more advantageous position for itself.  Attending Tuesday’s meeting, Botka reportedly shot down the idea of compromising with Fidesz, taking the position that MSZP should neither support nor propose modifications to the bill. The executive board accepted Botka’s position, and the party backed away from any collaboration with Fidesz.

&gt; However, the fact that certain MSZP politicians were willing to compromise lends credence to the notion that some kind of collaboration exists between Fidesz and the country’s largest left-wing party.

&gt; On Thursday, Hungarian weekly Heti Válasz published a story purporting to prove that Fidesz is keeping MSZP alive in the interest of preventing other democratic opposition parties from expanding their voter base. The weekly highlights three such examples in which Fidesz allegedly channeled funds to individuals and businesses with strong ties to MSZP, including lucrative state advertising contracts to print publications owned by former MSZP treasurer László Puch.

Yeah it was called the Cold war. 

&gt;It was beneficial move for the West to do it, it was a chance to finally push down Russian positions in Europe that they had held during the entire Cold war and also created new territories that were pro-Western and anti-Russian in a strategically and geographically important region of Europe. Plus Soviets kept 200.000 big military force in Baltic (their furthest Western territory) and it gave them a big military effect on the NATO in case of the war, it endangered Scandinavia and Finland too. Of course they wanted to get rid of it all with little risk of negative consequences and have friendly countries there instead, why wouldnt they if given the chance. 

You sound like alot like a Russian Latvian. 

&gt;Plus if you want to go here with moral arguments.......I also will remind you that our ''friendly friends'' in the West completely gave us up to Soviets in 1940 and did absolutely nothing when Soviets reoccupied Baltics in 1945 , even though ''morally'' they had been independent nations pre-WW2, part of League of nations and Western allies.

4883,"&gt; The OP is about the anniversary of a war

While that is technically true, it is still very heavily biased towards the British side. Not mentioning the Argentinians who died seems pretty odd to me. The last war my country officially fought is seen as a tragedy and we always mention the death and displaced of all nations as victims of that war, civilian or military. That conflict should have been solved diplomatically and it is the aggressor's fault for attacking and not solving things peacefully.

War is always a tragedy and every single person who dies is one too many. No matter whose side they fight on. And with a military dictatorship in your back you might not have that much of a choice but to go to war if they tell you to. Compare

&gt; 225 British servicemen were killed during the conflict.

4892,"On average, French power plants are quite old. Ten or so *will* have to be taken off the net in the near future. And France is just building one reactor right now, which is horribly over budget and will come online more than a dozen years after construction began. Therefore, France clearly is not able to replace its old power plants in time and with the required amount. It also begs the question if it is even able to afford it, considering the state of EDF's finances.

Please keep in mind that it is not realistic to expect construction on any new power plant to begin before 2025, and then it'll be still at least eight years (even accounting for lessons learned from Flamanvillle III) before just the *first one* will come online. This calls into question the validity of plans relying 100% on nuclear power, simply due to construction time required; and capital cost (every country would struggle to finance 6+ nuclear power plants within a few years). 

On the other hand, there are great locations in France for wind and solar power. Diversifying and decentralising the French grid would also help with grid stability (in Germany our grid got more stable since we began using decentralised energy production) and the local employment situation will also improve. In additon, wind and solar energy is really cheap today.

4905,"Population density in New York City is correlated to the area of New York City not the area of the US.

If you had 2000 cases and that was it then of course the overall population would indicate the amount of damage a country has suffered. 

But overall population does not affect the rate a single outbreak advances and how measures imposed affect this outbreak.

We are still in the expansion rate of the epidemic and therefore the comparison of the rates has more significance than the overall damage. Once this is said and done we can talk about per capita deaths and talk about relative damage.

Although again 2000 deaths might not mean much in the US but they will mean a lot if they are all concentrated in NYC for example.

This is why China's numbers are so low per capita, because they contained the spread in one province so in this case dividing by China's population leads to missleading results.

Also the way the world is connected nowadays it seems the virus is easier to spread between hubs across countries than within countries.

* Only recently were people explicitly forbidden from visiting care facilities for the old. Recommendations for three weeks have not been effective

* Mass transit is still a major spreader of the virus. Busses keep running full of people.

Delaying is the wrong word. It was not a legal purchase at this time. From the EU/German perspective, I guess the story is: ""A Swiss company tried to ignore the EU export ban.

\- they allowed Orban to spend incredible amounts of money on anti EU billboards, because they needed Fidesz for the EPP majority

\- they allowed Orban to fund organisations with EU money that are buying out independent media and turning them into propaganda channels, because they needed Fidesz for the EPP majority

\- they allowed Orban to erode democratic checks and balances, because they needed Fidesz for the EPP majority

They had 10 years to take action, but they didn't do shit, because they needed Fidesz to remain in the EPP. So yeah, they can go fuck themselves.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/ftp1to/13_parties_of_the_epp_write_to_epp_president_tusk/fmanaxq/,pinguz,1585900242

&gt;Its not communist

And yet every company is under control of the party . How can that be capitalist?


&gt;its much closer to a capitalist country than a communist one.

Being closer to capitalism doesn't necessarily make it capitalist, though.

Is China Capitalist?

But, as Herrera and Long argue, if France or another Western country were to collectivize all agricultural land and mining; nationalize the infrastructure of the country; transfer key industries to the government; set up a rigorous central planning; if the government strictly controlled the currency, all major banks and all financial institutions; if the government also closely monitored the behaviour of all domestic and foreign companies; and as if that were not enough, if there was a communist party at the top of the political pyramid to supervise it all, would we still, without inviting ridicule, speak of a “capitalist” country? Undoubtedly not. We would perhaps label it as “socialist” or “communist”. Yet it is odd that people stubbornly refuse to stick those labels on the political-economic system operative in China.

An essential element to explain the successes of China is its agricultural policy. China is one of the few countries in the world that has guaranteed access to agricultural land for its farming population. After the revolution, agricultural land came into government hands and every farmer was allocated a piece of land. That measure applies to this day.

Opening up the economy to foreign countries – trade, investment and financial capital flows – has had disastrous consequences in many third-world countries. In China, this opening has been successful because it was subordinate to domestic needs and objectives, and because it was fully integrated into a solid development strategy.

After the opening up and the reforms under Deng Xiaoping, according to Herrera and Long, “socialism has retreated enormously in China”. Today, Chinese society is “far removed from the communist egalitarian ideal”. The authors refer to a number of aspects such as individualism, consumerism, favouritism, careerism, the craving for luxury and glamour, corruption, etc. These aspects are certainly disturbing, but the Chinese leadership is doing its utmost to restore “socialist morality”.

It is certainly not communism, but neither is it capitalism. For Marx, capitalism presupposes a strong separation between labour on the one hand and ownership of the most important means of production on the other. The owners of capital tend to become collectives (shareholders) of people who no longer directly manage the production process, but leave that to managers. Earnings often take the form of dividends on shares.

The vast majority of the incredibly large number of small Chinese enterprises – mostly family or artisan owned businesses – certainly do not meet that criterion. Nor does the criterion apply to the many “collectively owned” companies where the workers own part of the production equipment and have a voice in its management, and it is not in the least applicable to the cooperatives. Even in public companies, the separation between labour and property is not that clear. Because there too there is a certain, albeit limited, form of participatory management for blue-collar and office workers. In short, the separation between labour and property is often very relative.

Another important criterion for a society to be capitalist is the maximization of individual profit. In any case, this does not apply to the large state-owned companies, where the most important means of production are allocated.

In their argument about whether or not the system is capitalist, they focus on ownership relationships. That is correct, but only partly, because ownership relationships are not completely indicative of the government’s control over the economy. By either granting or not granting access to procurement contracts, tax breaks, to public investment funds, financial institutions and grants, etc., central government controls entire sectors including private companies, without having direct control over individual companies or holding shares in them.[iv]

5265,"**At the beginning of the Corona crisis, many EU countries chose to go it alone by closing borders and banning exports. The European idea? Forgotten. Germany now wants to make up for this - especially in the case of Italy.** 

The German government wants to use conscious European joint actions to counteract the impression that the European Union is failing as a community of solidarity in the corona crisis. Berlin is concerned that some countries are deliberately trying to reinforce this impression with disinformation campaigns; it concedes in a self-critical tone that initially Europe did not respond to the crisis in a united manner.

Germany is now trying to make gestures of solidarity with Italy in particular. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told the Italian newspaper ""Corriere della Sera"" that solidarity in difficult times ""belongs to the foundation of the European Union"". And he regretted that ""even in the migration crisis we did not always manage to put this into practice, also with regard to Italy"". Following the recent video summit of EU heads of state and government, German Chancellor Angela Merkel admitted that it was necessary to ""realise that in tackling the crisis we naturally took very different approaches at the beginning and did not always act in a well coordinated manner either"".

**European database for intensive care beds**

Maas said that ""all conceivable instruments"" must now be used for coordination. A Europe based on solidarity must ""ensure that all available resources within the EU get quickly to where they are most urgently needed"". He suggested creating a European database, following the German example, in which all clinics voluntarily reported their free capacities of intensive care beds and ventilation places. Germany has now offered 63 places for Italian intensive care patients. It should also be considered whether production capacities for ""strategic goods"" such as medical protective equipment should not be moved back to Europe.

The German Foreign Minister also called for stronger European cooperation in order to expose ""false information and conspiracy theories about the coronavirus"" that are being spread by some countries. He stated that the German Office for the Protection of the Constitution ""is currently registering a sharp increase in such disinformation from third countries"". Behind this, he said, was ""quite obviously the intention to undermine the confidence of the population in our crisis management"".

**Germany bet on the national card**

Meanwhile in Brussels, it is critically noted that, especially in the early stages of the crisis, Germany did not behave in an exemplary manner either. On 4 March, Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) issued an export ban on medical protective clothing - also for all EU states. His party colleague in Brussels, Ursula von der Leyen, then threatened him with infringement proceedings. The President of the Commission saw Spahn's ban as a breach of the dam: if Germany bet on the national card, the others would follow. That is exactly what happened, France followed suit immediately.
Then more and more states introduced border controls without - as agreed - consulting each other. Although Germany was not the first country in this series, von der Leyen was as surprised as the rest of Europe by the Berlin decision on 15 March to reinstate border controls. Although she was not against travel restrictions in principle, she was working on a list of exceptions when the call came from Berlin.

**""Too many initially chose to go it alone""**

When she castigated national solo efforts on Thursday, Berlin must have felt addressed: ""When Europe really had to be there for each other, too many people thought only of themselves at first. When Europe needed real community spirit, too many chose to go it alone at first."" The unilateral decision of some countries to stop exports to other countries in the internal market makes no sense.

No country can cover its demand for vital goods on its own - not even Germany, where medical technology manufacturers urgently need parts that are produced in neighbouring countries. Minister of Health Spahn has now recognised this and amended his decree.

I've not had problems getting any essentials and the situation is calm. The only place I've seen panic is on social media (as is tradition). 

This is an unprecedented (for anyone alive today) crisis. No one knows what the best way to deal with it is, even if hysterical redditors will tell you otherwise. Just today I read an interview with an expert who was discussing the problem that the countries that have started isolating people are just pushing the problem further and further in the future. At one point we'll have to allow people to work and have normal contacts again (our economy can't sustain many months of shutdown), but if few people were infected and have immunity by then the whole crisis will start all over again.

I see it more as a teaching moment.

France does very poorly looking at the size of it.

So it is a good moment for people like that to look in the mirror, and realize for a country that big, it is just a poor-Germany, and unlike the UK, it never managed to project their soft power due to clumsy politics.

5306,"&gt;1) how would have the the crisis of 2008 ended?

the american crisis? in the alternative history without the Euro currency, it might have played out just the same.

&gt;2) how would we have survived the european debt crisis

It wouldn't have been as severe in the first place, because without the Euro e.g. Greece would not have been able sell remotely as many bonds before the crisis. 

But even if not, if even without the Euro  Greece had somehow accumulated an unsustainable amount of  debt, what would happen is: drachma loses value (wrt other currencies), which is basically austerity without having to pass the unpopular laws --  exchange value of social welfare and government salaries decrease, as do labor costs in general, making the greek economy more competitive. Greek bonds also lose exchange value, a risk  the creditors understood when they bought them.

&gt;a sovereign default is likely 

Much less likely for a country that controls its own currency. The bigger risk would be runaway inflation, like in parts of South America.

&gt;3) how harder is it to use quantitative easing to keep the interest rate constant

not sure what you mean. 

Before the ECB, the individual currencies had individual central banks, they could all do QE, and of course the needs differ between countries. 

Right now a lot of people complain that countries like Germany benefit from the Euro because it's too weak for their economy; if they had their own currency the exchange value of their labor etc would be higher.

&gt;Zuvor hatten mehrere Länder, darunter Deutschland, Frankreich und Italien, einen Exportstopp für medizinisches Schutzmaterial verfügt, um sicher genügend Ware für die eigene Bevölkerung zu haben.

&gt;Die EU-Kommission ihrerseits verabschiedete am 15. März eine allgemeine Bewilligungspflicht für den Export von fünf verschiedenen Schutzgütern aus der EU. Wer also in einem Nicht-EU-Land etwa Atemschutzmasken aus der EU importieren wollte, musste dafür eine Bewilligung des exportierenden Mitgliedstaates haben. Das betraf auch die Schweiz, da sie als Drittstaat eingestuft worden war.

&gt;In den vergangenen zwei Wochen wurden in der Folge mehrere Lieferungen an Schutzmaterial an der Schweizer Grenze aufgehalten: In Deutschland blockierten die Zollbehörden einen Lastwagen, der 240 000 Schutzmasken und weiteres medizinisches Material in die Schweiz hätte transportieren sollen. Ebenfalls beschlagnahmte Frankreich eine Lieferung mit Schutzmasken, die ein privates Schweizer Unternehmen in die Schweiz importieren wollte.

&gt;Dank der Vereinbarung dürften sämtliche blockierte Sendungen umgehend freigegeben werden. «Wir gehen davon aus, dass die Mitgliedsländer der EU die neue Regelung ohne Ausnahme umsetzen», erklärt dazu eine bundesratsnahe Quelle.

-Russia is given the island of Gotland, hopefully the natives won't scare them away this time around

-Iceland receives Stockholm, they need all the population and relevance they can get. They also receive a enclave of forest in Småland so that they finally have some trees

-Faroese islands get the western coast from bohusläns to halland, so that they have a new coastline to bash up some whales on. I also would love to see them handle an archipelago that isn't super hostile to humans

-Greenland gets Skåne and Blekinge, just to spite Denmark some more.

-Czechia and Slovakia will get the island of Öland in return for reuniting back to Czechoslovakia, and naming the island to something more creative than ""island-land"", I would love a name without any vowels whatsoever. This would also mean that the czech people finally have a place to have their navy since they aren't landlocked any longer

-Vatican state gets Jönköping as it is the most religious town, but SYKE they're devout protestants not catholic, what now pope???

&gt; I am still not sure what you are trying to achieve

&gt; It must be true cause it is written in a book?

There is often no definite winner in philosophy. There is however an attempt at thorough exploration of all the issues and all possible arguments. If one's goal is to understand shit properly, reading on what humanity previously worked on regarding said topic helps save a lot of time and be more thorough. While I enjoy thinking on my own more and *then* reading up to compare and refine, there isn't always enough pre-acquired knowledge ammunition to think things through properly. Studying the literature on a given topic is not the admission that one's mind is inferior to the minds of the various authors.

From the beginning my stance has been to not give a fuck about allocating time to a Reddit debate on this topic. Since you're obviously interested, I was, with a helpful mindset rather than a lecturing know-it-all one, saying that there are people who treated this very topic thoroughly, that it is subtle indeed and actually interesting. You'll never find that level of insight on Reddit. I wish I could recommend specific literature, but I can't, since I've mostly been exposed to great Parliamentary reflection and literature arguments reported through intermediates.

Does the EU as an organization recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state? No, it doesn't. Heck, is there even a single country in Europe that recognizes Taiwan as a sovereign state? Well, there is one. The Holy See. That's it. No one else in Europe recognizes Taiwan as a sovereign state. The US, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, India, South Africa or any other powerful nation doesn't recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state either.

You want to know who recognizes Taiwan? Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland), Belize, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Haiti, Paraguay, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau and Tuvalu. That's it.

So, China has every reason to think that we'll just forget about it. The only countries that recognize Taiwan's existence hold almost no power in the diplomatic game.

5519,"A couple of points:

  


First, you have to consider that the countries in which NATO expanded made that decision autonomously and had wanted to join ""the West"" for a long time, including organising revolutions to try and remove Russian control. So it's very inaccurate to say that the US expanded NATO towards Russia when in reality those countries really wanted to join NATO and the US just said yes.

  


Second, in the hypothetical case that Russia decides to cooperate with the West and realign its geopolitical goals in accordance with the West, it wouldn't be against the expansion of NATO. Yes, this would be a massive change and would take time and potentially hurt Russia in the short term but it could be worth it for the long-term development potential which it would unlock - imagine a Russia which isn't competing but rather is cooperating with Europe. The Yeltsin situation isn't what I'm talking about because it was accompanied by an unusual weakness of Russia caused by its economic and political transition, as well as the ""Western cooperation"" lasting too short and not being strong enough. Imagine rather the post-WW2 change of relations between France and Germany which saw two long-standing rivals becoming part of the same economic union and both massively benefiting from their now very cooperative relationship. Of course, both still have different foreign policies but they are broadly aligned. Now imagine something similar for Russia - even an eventual membership in the EU. I'm not saying that's likely to happen in the next century or so and I'm not claiming with any certainty that it would be successful if it did happen.

An American ***governor*** now claims he didn't know the virus transmits person-to-person, while others are issuing restrictions so loose as to be absolutely worthless such as by deeming religious gatherings as ""essential"", and those are who most Americans have to rely on because of Trump's refusal to use the federal options available to him that almost any other president would have used by now to mitigate the crisis.

And it did worked - in the first day of mass meetings Crimean Tatars, while being only about 1/10 of Crimean population in numbers, managed to mobilize for meeting at the Parliament of Crimea in Simferopol as much people as pro-Russians. But then Crimean Tatars failed to conduct ""resistance"". May be because only a part of them wanted to oppose Russia and and pro-Russians, may be because of fearing to fight against Russian military.

The other guy is right; even when something can be proven (hearts pump blood, atoms are made up of smaller particles, OH mollecules have a negative electronic charge) it's because of the simplicity of what you are observing, and you are describing the thing rather than dictating to the universe what it should be.

In this subject, it is possible to be designated as male at birth, but have female genetic makeup. It's possible to be born with both sets of genitalia. It is possible to be born with various sets of chromosones which don't conform to ""normal"". Sexual dimorphism is still a thing, but not everything complies to it.

I’m saying it’s valuable for many reasons. Some are militaristic and some are nationalistic. And yes, being a good vacation spot is definitely part of the reason. The Russian people like having it in the federation and it was a popular move over there.

Also, it was taken without any fighting at all. There was already a big Russian naval base in Sevastopol and so the locals didn’t put up a fight.

By the way, tourism is a huge part of the peninsula.

Did you ever wonder why the towns have Greek sounding names and white plastered Greek looking architecture? The actual Greeks left Crimea hundreds of years ago when the Turks took over. When the Russians took over they thought the Greek looking buildings and names gave it a more Mediterranean and exotic feel, so they incorporated it into the aesthetic of the place.

Conte is key: he simply is the best ""non politicized"" politician we've had ***in ten years***.

5810,"&gt; The idea that Mittwoch is some exception to this rule requires some strong evidence IMO.

At least I delivered sources, unlike you...

A bit more: Duden lists Mittwoch as a translation of the **Ecclesiastical Latin** ""media hebdomas"". Weird, probably has nothing to do with the Christian church. DWDS writes (DeepL translation)

&gt;The education [translation Error, they mean the word Mittwoch, not Education] that spread under the influence of Christianity replaces an older pagan term received in nl. woensdag, engl. Wednesday, swed. onsdag, actually 'Day of (God) Wotan or Odin'. 

From a [Wikipedia article](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wochentag#Deutsche_Wochentagsnamen), I know, not the best source:

&gt;During the Christianization of the (Old High) German language area the missionaries tried to enforce weekday names that did not remind of pagan (Roman or Germanic) gods. On the one hand, this becomes clear on Wednesday, where the name of the day in the course of the week avoided the name Wotan (see English Wednesday), which was actually to be expected. The other example is the naming of the day before Sunday: Satertag, borrowed from Latin (Saturni dies), extends into English (Saturday), but in the German-speaking world it is more and more replaced by two other terms - a neutral Saturday and a Christian Saturday. Satertag/Saterdag is only found in the Lower German area and today only in the dialect. 

The [atrocious website](http://www.kms16.at/html/WOCHENTAGE.htm) of a school in Vienna suggests the same, but they have that script that prevents you from selecting text and I'm too lazy to install noscript for this.

Can you point towards a source that at least suggests that this might have been a ""random mutation"" that has nothing to do with church?
