Germany is one of the primary beneficiaries of the current world order and appears to be very happy to just ride it without doing its part. I agree that the US is ridiculous sometimes, but Europe benefits from things like open trade routes in the South China Sea or from Iran not blocking Saudi Oil ships.

It’s not as straightforward as whether or not Germany is invaded, it benefits from a stable environment for things like Trade. Countries like Germany and Japan should pivot towards being active members in maintaining this if they value the current trade system where people can send goods anywhere and not be harassed by pirates or local conflicts.

No, there are still a lot of work left to be done. And I agree with you on austerity.

Italy should have been running a fiscal deficit *and* done structural reforms. ECB not hiking interest rates would also have helped. 

So there were policy errors, both at the national and the supranational level. But to claim that Italy's reforms ""have already been done"" is beyond absurd.

49,"The air mass movement in the eastern part of US is bit different than in Europe due topology. USA does not have east-west mountains to block sinking air from the north or tropical moist air masses from the Gulf. Alps-Carpathians, Dinar, and Pyrenees mountains do block some air masses from S-N directions, but not much from W to E. Appalachians do block some cold air masses and humidity pushed by Alberta clipper (dry cold) or Bermuda high (hot humid). But these mountains are not that high, especially through Pennsylvania to block air masses the same way the Rockies, Cascades, or Sierras do at the West.    

However, in the US, you can get an Arctic vortex, very deep in low latitudes I was in Georgia and Carolinas when it snowed there a lot. Atlanta is on the same latitude as Egypt. The coastal lows can pick a lot of moisture from the ocean and dump a significant amount of alloying the I-95. The Great Lakes also makes a big difference in weather while Appalachians do block snow from it to pile farther east. I was once in DC and went to Chicago. It was about 28C in DC or 80F there with already summer like weather, but it was freezing in Chicago at night, and day temperature was barely around 8C.    

European weather is more like belt in West-East direction, with further east, you get more continental weather. It is generally colder north of the Alps, and warmer south of it. Here in US, the same belt will not work as the weather in the West, Midwest, and East vary along the same latitude.

&gt;Lib Dems will oppose May's Chequers plan - Cable
&gt;
&gt;If Theresa May strikes a Brexit deal with Brussels based on her Chequers plan the Liberal Democrats will oppose it, Sir Vince Cable has warned.
&gt;
&gt;""We are not going to buy it,"" the Lib Dem leader told a fringe meeting at his party's conference to loud applause.
&gt;
&gt;He said the party's 12 MPs - with one exception - were ""solid"" in their determination to stop Brexit.

-

&gt; Mr Cable, who was business secretary in David Cameron's coalition government, said the Chequers deal had an ""enormous hole in it"" because it did not include services - which make up 80% of the British economy.
&gt;
&gt;The Chequers plan was a ""second best solution"" to the issue of frictionless trade in goods but was based on a ""very, very complicated mechanism,"" he added.
&gt;
&gt;And Mr Cable said he could not vote for it even if the government claimed the only alternative was a no deal Brexit because there are ""better alternatives"".
&gt;
&gt;Sir Vince, who is campaigning for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, said: ""We're absolutely solid that we need to vote against Brexit and stop it.""

To clarify, when people use the phrase ""referendum on the final Brexit deal"", they're not talking about a choice between Leave no-deal or Leave with-a-deal.

There are no mountain barriers and there is a huge space that allows tropical moister from Caribbean and Gulf to flow north, or drag a cold Arctic air to latitude similar to Egypt or northern India. There is absolutely nothing stopping it a that point. Plus climate in the West is different. You have high, semi-arid deserts from Mexican borders via Arizona and New Mexico all the way to Canadian borders where summer temperature reach 40C every year and very little moister, while the Eastern seaboard get twice that rain that gets Central and Western Europe.

Although Mr Hode was a refugee, the
applicants did not qualify for “family
reunion” under the Immigration Rules
because the marriage had taken place after
he left Somalia. Moreover, as Mr Hode had
only been granted five years’ Leave to
Remain, Mrs Abdi could not join him as the
spouse of a person present and settled in
the United Kingdom.
Violation of Article 14 (prohibition of
discrimination) in conjunction with Article 8

02.03.2010
The case concerned the complaint by the
applicants, accused of involvement in the
murder of two British soldiers shortly after
the invasion of Iraq in 2003, that their
transfer by the British authorities into Iraqi
custody put them at real risk of execution
by hanging.
Violation of Article 3 (prohibition of

More control over law, since nothing the EU says would be binding. 
More autonomy over things such as border control (less migration overall). 

^ However the above could also be done while staying in the EU and just playing the EU, which is something countries like Hungary and Poland are doing. Britain was in an excellent position to carry out a large amount of influence within the European Union. If they had leaders who just stopped migration and would try to solve the hard issues that a multicultural society brings then they wouldn't have been in this mess in the first place. A very big campaign point of the Brexit was autonomy of its borders, less migration, less overall migration and this would also entail less presence of Islam in British society. None of this however happens in reality.    

Though British leaders could decide for a very strict and heavy screening at their borders which for them are quite easy to control compared to other countries. They could also make their country very unattractive for asylum seekers by only giving the bare minimum. Further on a national level laws could be made that enforce more clarity regarding investments / financing of religious houses. Possibly also laws against these investments.

142,"I think you’re over simplifying things a bit. 

Firstly, the religion of the pre-Islamic Arabian peninsula was not really a religion as we would understand it today. Nearly every tribe had it’s own major and minor gods they worshipped, and almost no Arab at the time would have considered themselves to be a part of anything close to a unified pagan religion. 




In regards to the gods they worshiped, many were either corruptions of Greek or Roman gods, borrowed Mesopotamian deities, or native Arab gods like Al Uzzat and Al Lat. Yet these gods lacked anything close to a unified mythology, and thier worship mostly revolved around offerings to the statues and ceremonial sacrifices.









So to say that Islam “demolished” the existening paganism is a bit dramatic. In the end the paganism of the pre-Islamic Arabs would have been forgotten by nearly any religion. Had most of the Arabs comverted to Christianity, we would still be largely in the same position because Arab paganism could not have survived as a religion because it wasn’t one.

The entire problem is that once a large enough percentage of jobs are replaced, the economic system starts to fail because there will be a large enough population of people who won't be able to get jobs regardless of if they want to work or not, sounds like a utopia but no income(via a job) is a problem with the current system.

Be able to individually intervene in proxy wars, maintain a balance of power against great powers, this is the aim of such a military.

166,"&gt; 470 million euro's does not mean it can collide with any freighter and survive

It won't make it immune to collision.  However, normally warships are designed to sustain damage and not sink — you expect to be able to keep the thing afloat even after they've suffered serious damage.  So it is viable to build ability to stand up to damage and make use of redundancy into the thing, and normally that sort of thing is one of the things you're paying more for on a warship.

That doesn't mean that this ship should have been able to just continue on here — I'm sure that we'll know more down the line, once Norway has investigated.  I'd expect that one thing that Norway will do is to evaluate whether the ship could have been kept afloat, and if not, what changes would need to be made to permit that.

Capitalism. Capitalism is based on infinite growth. Companies have to make more money this year than last year. The country has to generate more taxes this year than last year to pay for the national debt. If there isn't growth the system falls apart.

245,"The Ukraine has always had a problem with minority language rights. This was cited as a potential deal breaker with any EU negotiations. Even before the Russian invasion, the treatment of Russian was absurd. I mean the city known worldwide as Odessa, with 90 percent speaking Russian and all commercial stuff there in Russian, was called Odesa officially and on all government structures since the fall of the USSR. Not billingual. Just the Ukrainian version never actually used in the city. While Ukraine is now the good guy and Russia is the bad one (and yes, this is justified) some weird censorship makes world media not talk about the internal reasons of the whole mess (and this censorship is unjustified), but if you talked to the people of Odessa, Crimea, Donetsk or Kharkiv say in 2012 during the Euro Cup and before shit hit the fan in the East, they were mad about the language and spelling stuff. Not all of them but many. Especially those that knew how it worked in the EU, with minorities even as small as the German one left in Poland (billingual names everywhere etc). So I’m not sure tighting the screw even farther will do the Ukraine good. But than I don’t understand the Ukraine at all, I mean there is this Russian singer Oleg Gazmanov, with a famous 2006 hit “Sdelan v SSSR” (made in the USSR), who is now banned in Ukraine. But when you look on Youtube and look for his nostalgic power anthem live, one of the top hits is a gigantic crowed singing along with USSR symbols during some 2012 concert in Kharkiv. So the language policy of the state is consistant, the feelings of the people probably differ by region and are too much for most to understand and as the media now has an agenda (pro Ukraine on BBC pro Russia on RT etc) we never get any real information about how the people feel :(.

Sorry for the long post, had to get it out of my chest.

249,"So to summarise. 

The UK got nothing it wanted and every reason Leavers gave for Brexit (ending freedom of movement, not being bound by Brussels' laws, making trade deals with other nations) cannot happen in the agreement.

But the government will pretend it can have everything it wanted ""once the transition period has finished"".

Which is probably never, because in two years' time the same problems will still exist, and the UK cannot unilaterally break from the agreement without the EU's consent.

Every political group hates this agreement. They hate each other more. 

Parliament will probably vote for it, because it offers false hope so is less scary than any  alternatives.

The EU may or may not agree to it. The French, Dutch and Spanish are already voicing concerns.

The idea is that over time, economies converge from the result of accumulation of capital raising productive output. Because emerging economies nowadays have access to the latest technology, they can grow faster. It takes less capital to achieve more growth.

Whereas industrialised, high GDP per capita countries have already built their infrastructure base and either don't have the latest technology because they don't need it or too expensive to upgrade, or they only have some of the latest technologies due to incremental upgrades. Thus growth is slower as you reach an upper bound.

Okay you're in charge. Who'd you hold accountable ? What would you do to them ?

Pointing fingers turns out to be rather pointless ain't it ?

&gt; Meanwhile emissions in the West have not remotely came close to as they should be, in fact all we've really done is export our consumerism abroad and those people are expected to not only fulfill our consumption, but to take the blame. 

And they won't be if they continue to increase, like for example inside the EU. 

Also I don't know why everyone is focused on ""emissions in the west"" as the american said it, earth doesn't care. Even if the west lowers it's emissions to an acceptable level, India won't. Not in same time frame. Brazil won't.  Other developing nations won't do it in time.  Which means the Global CO2 levels remain at the same level in the best possible scenario. Which is useless.

So as I said,  what matters is that it decreases anywhere. If you have one side decreasing and the other increasing it will achieve nothing to stop the change.

Is it unfair to developing countries ? Yes. It is however what needs to be done.  You won't achieve anything by pussyfooting about and saying ""well the west tried, but others didn't"" 

On the other hand I really don't care what happens, we survived worse things in the balkans.

317,"&gt; Whataboutism doesnt work here.

WTF are you talking about?   Not only is ""Whataboutism"" the most overused lazy thing you can accuse someone of.....

This is not even what that means.

**Whataboutism is when you concede a fact, but say the importance or conclusion drawn from that fact is different because of the existence of a different fact.**

That is what ""Whataboutism"" means.

For example.

""Yes, I stole $10 from your wallet, but what about the time you drank all my beer?""

That is whataboutism.

_______________________________________________

In this case the first person, GatineuKing stated that *""THE US FEARS THE POSSIBILITY OF A EUROPEAN ARMY""*.

As a resident and citizen of the United States I am telling you that my personal experience indicates THE OPPOSITE.

That is neither proof, nor statistical evidence.  It is anecdotal.

However, that anecdotal evidence from a US citizen and resident should probably be respected as much as the ramblings of a Canadian and a French person basing their opinions on what?

Trump tweets that you are either lying about or don't understand.

TRUMP TWEET:

“Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia,” Trump began in his first tweet. “But it was Germany in World Wars One &amp; Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!”

He is daring you to make a European army.  He's calling your bluff.  He's saying if you don't pay for NATO you don't get NATO.  

No pay, no play.  Get it?

How anyone could pretend that tweet implies Trump is SCARED of a European Army is hilarious.

But even if Trump said, *""Oh my god, please no.  Not a EU army""*, that doesn't represent the United States.

Trump's tweets barely represent Trump. lmfao.  

Aaaaaaaaaaaanyway.

371,"There are many dimensions to this, some of them you touched on. I just wanted to add a few things. It is understood by some that the Turkish Republic could indeed be a continuing state to the Ottoman Empire, as in both are the same state, so pinning the genocide on either one or the other may not make much sense in this context - this perhaps could be a legal / technical perspective though. On the other hand usually people view the official establishment of the Turkish Republic to be in 1923 - so the popular view may differ where there is a black and white division in people's minds. That is why imho in general it makes more sense to talk about the specific government which carried out the genocide more so than the republic or the empire, at least in my view. Another thing which I wanted to mention is that the CUP did have Islamic hues to its policies and the formation of the demography of the future republic was based on religion.

Things don't go according to plan most of the time, I think trying to regulate migration is destined to fail, people are just too stubborn, anti immigration people will always find something to complain about, and immigrants will always find ways to beat the system.

What we need to do is reduce the incentive for immigration from both our part and the immigrant's part.

First of all increase birth rates in the west in order to reduce the incentive for immigration from our end. You do this by reducing inequality. If inequality is reduced, having babies will become more affordable. Coupled with a shift in culture to encourage families to have more babies, this would increase birthrates, and eliminate the need to bring in foreign workers to sustain the economy.

Then we should try to stabilize the third world countries where the immigrants come from. We need to stop global warming, we need to stop selling weapons, we need to stop supporting dictators. Then we need to let the 3rd world countries develop their economies. 

If we do all this, then the immigrants won't have reasons to immigrate to the west in the first place.

636,"&gt; Are there in the end?

Yes. At least so far. My friend had such a loan, and laughed at people crying for government help, because he still paid less for his mortgage than if he loaned in PLN :)

I took a mortgage in PLN, but considered franks, and I assure you ""being trendy"" or voting PIS or PO had nothing to do with it :)

&gt; Lemmings slowly followed and ""victims of the banks""

I don't get you use of the ""lemmings"". Is that supposed to be PO voters? Middle class? Stupid people?

I shall remind you, that:

 - KNF under Balcerowicz  tried to warn people about frank loans because of currency rate risks, and PO had no problem with that warning, it was PIS who protested the KNF warning in famous public announcement bashing KNF for ""sowing fear"", and ""preventing poor people from buying houses"". Source - http://old.pis.org.pl/article.php?id=4415

Do read that, you will be entertained. I especially like conspiracy theories they invented to explain why Balcerowicz didn't wanted Poles to take loans in foreign currencies :)

 - PO did nothing to help ""lemmings"" with frank loans, PIS promised to do something and is still occasionally saying they will eventually change the law so that banks will have to pay the difference on the loans

644,"&gt; I'm not law expert, but for me irregular does not imply illegal. 

Of course not. In a country that doesn't punish unauthorised entry, irregular immigration isn't illegal. In a country that doesn't punish unauthorised leaving, irregular emigration isn't illegal. 

Countries that have signed the UN refugee convention are also not allowed to punish people for entering the country unauthorised if they directly come from a country where they are under threat and if they report to authorities immediately. Would you call this illegal immigration? Even if there's no punishment? 

That's why they use irregular migration when talking about illegal migration in an international context. 

It still means what people call illegal immigration. 

-----

Here's the definition by the IOM

&gt; Irregular migration - Movement that takes place outside the regulatory norms of the sending, transit and receiving countries. There is no clear or universally accepted definition of irregular migration. From the perspective of destination countries it is entry, stay or work in a country without the necessary authorization or documents required under immigration regulations. From the perspective of the sending country, the irregularity is for example seen in cases in which a person crosses an international boundary without a valid passport or travel document or does not fulfil the administrative requirements for leaving the country. There is, however, a tendency to restrict the use of the term ""illegal migration"" to cases of smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/9wy8tm/czechs_join_eu_states_rejecting_un_migration_pact/e9osv9a/,fluchtpunkt,1542213393

The irony is that Boris, of all people, is pointing out that in doing the thing that he himself told us we had to do in order to take back control, we may well lose the control that we had - which is the joke I was making.

Yeh, it's verbs that that usually give away non-native speakers, but the accent will usually do that a long time before you even had any chance to mess up a verb :/

Germans can be quite ""anal"" about picking up on stuff like that, for the longest time it was the basis to ""identify"" them nasty ""foreigners"" who supposedly never properly ""assimilated"", along with family names.

Case in point: I have a Slavic family name and look, but I was born in Germany. To this day it happens that people will either react surprised when they hear me speak, after only knowing me from my name, or people will flat out praise me for speaking such good German.

It's not like the last time I spoke any Serbo-Croatian was when I was like 5 years old, you know?

787,"&gt;All you proved was theoretical, you need to give concrete examples of liquid hydrogen storage

No I don't. I've got to show that we have the possibility, not that we already SOLVED the issue. To ask of this is completely unreasonable. I could as well ask you where is a host of nuclear power plants that replaced our carbon. There's not such a thing just as well as we don't have the same for alternatives. We're discussing viable alternatives, not already-finished ones. Possibility is all that we can and should debate.

&gt; The study you cited was done in an university in Morocco, with most likely very low estimates for land and construction since labor and land is cheap there compared to developed countries in Europe. 

As always in science, the estimates have sources in that paper, namely for tunneling costs they referred to this german study:  
[http://www.rwth-aachen.de/global/show\_document.asp?id=aaaaaaaaaagvvyq](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/global/show_document.asp?id=aaaaaaaaaagvvyq)

&gt; Even with that, you came up with 6000$/kwh, where mine was 0.001$/kwH. So it's literally 6 MILLION TIMES better to have nuclear waste storage than pumped storage. 

As the math proved, no, that's not the comparison you can make, you can't compare energy storage with waste storage, also you can't compare cumulative waste with continuous employment. Apples and oranges. I'm speaking of the cost of having the equivalent function of producing energy for the world, not of matching a reusable-construction investment figure with a one-time consumption one. Keeping a 1mwh nuclear centrall roughly produces 1ton of waste for a year. How much capacity storage do we need for the same time-frame? Say 50%? that's a 500kwh plant. So if you only count 1 year that would mean 3.5 billion euros/6500 so, roughly 540k euros, while the gravity stocking is 500\*6000$ or 3 million dollars. Except that the year after the nuclear power plant costs another 540k euros for stocking away another ton of waste, while the capacitor is still built. Takes a meager 5 tonnes or years to have the same cost, while a gravity storage plant has a lifetime of 40-60 years. So, as you can see, there's no reasonable logic into comparing the one-time-only installation investment to the yearly cost of operation for nuclear.

By the way, what's the math behind the 0.001$/kwh figure? because the 3.5billion cost to store 6500 tonnes means 6500mwh/yr or as if we had a 1mwh plant on for 6500years, which leads me to 3500000000 euros/(1000kwh\*365\*24\*6500) or  0.06146821215 euro/kwh. that's at least one order of magnitude away from your estimate.

&gt; I believe the rest of the thread and your posts have served its purpose, so I don't think there is any more discussion to be had with an irrational poster.. 

I clearly showed that the alternatives are there, are viable and are cheaper than nuclear, you didn't reply anything to my numbers, you just dismissed perfectly valid options without any reason... who's irrational here?

If an EU member can fail to provide proper fighting equipment for their own sons; is there any reason they would be less likely to fail to provide proper equipment for someone who is more distant (and whose deprivation they can try to blame on other EU members)?

It might be more effective to have an EU Army as a central organizational authority capable of inducting various national units into EU service. In times of crisis it would induct various national units into the EU command structure, but in peacetime the EU army would mostly be a general staff intended to provide leadership to a much larger fully mobilized EU force and some high readiness regular forces (equal in number to approximately 5 to 10% of the overall size expected of a wartime force).",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9wyc22/european_army/e9ocs8f/,Kahzootoh,1542198576

834,"&gt;Did Czechia put their tanks under German command?

Effectively, yes. What happens in case of actual war is another case though, Germany can't just deploy Czech T-72's in Afghanistan. But they will be part of the German command structure. Think of it as something like merging companies, it's mostly cost saving by cutting down administration. You need a lot of specialised army staff for a mechanized force and especially tanks and those don't really scale well with size. As in, for a small force you need the same number of staff and facilities as you need for a force of 150 tanks. That's a problem for smaller countries, as that naturally leads to problem with modernization of forces etc. etc. The current concept is called ""umbrella army"" for that reason, with Germany acting as an umbrella to allow smaller nations to keep some mechanized capacity for cost-efficiently, thus helping the readiness, training and equipment of european armies overall. The next step for the Czech republic, for example, is replacing the T-72's with Leopards to unify supply chains and cut down on maintanance cost while also modernizing their tank forces.

&gt;And who is responsible for training and maintenance?

Both for the first, the Czech Republic for the latter. The tanks will stay stationed in the Czech Republic as well, although there's talks of moving them to Weiden in Bavaria in the future.",North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany),/r/europe/comments/9wpmsn/merkel_voices_support_macrons_proposal_for_a/e9ocu54/,Earl_of_Northesk,1542198653

In the end, the regulation is a net positive for the EU, even if you don't see it that way.

You may not notice it because they're often lower profile than in the US, but the culture sector in Europe is quite big.

942,"&gt; The issue is that renewable energy (With the exception of hydro power) is intermittent 

That's a very well known issue with very well known solution. We can store the energy (with tech like hydrogen fuel, capacitors, gravity storage etc) during peak production and problem solved.

&gt; You can check the graph for yourself [here. (Page 10)](https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/en/corporate/pdf/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2018-full-report.pdf) 

I checked that british petroleum depliant only to find a graph about the world production of energy by year, which has no bearing on this topic. We're discussing what should we do, not what we did.

&gt; While increased amount of renewables does help lower the C02 emissions, they're not growing fast enough. 

Yes, because we're leaving it to the market, which is the insane thing to do. We need to invest resources and pass laws to fix the problem, not just wait for it to happen on its own. By the way, according to the bp graph nuclear isn't growing enough either, so either something is done or both options will not do.

&gt; Is temporarily increased nuclear power really worse than not making the 2050 goal? Because that's the alternative. 

It isn't. We can invest in renewables, that's a third viable option.

975,"&gt;of most social plagues that have doomed the West for good.

May i ask what you mean by that last sentence? As a Dutchman ive often heard foreigners tell me my country is doomed, yet i still very much disagree with that. Statistics often shown to me are about muslim immigration, age of general population etc. I can counter all those statistics. Less than 5% of the Dutch population is muslim, but of that 5% less than half consider themselves ''pious muslims'' who visit the mosque atleast every week, and the percentage of total muslims visiting mosques is decreasing further in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont mind immigration if they integrate. And even tho people like Wilders claim otherwise, the % thats causing trouble is only small and gets smaller each generation. The age issues will have to be resolved by automatization and in part immigration. And if that fails, its time eastern Europe repays some of the many investments we invested in them. If our economy becomes the one lagging behind eastern europe, i see no reason why eastern europeans should not pay to keep our standards of living secured. Especially for us Dutch, since we're the ones who contribute the most to the EU budget per capita by most. 

&amp;#x200B;

But for some reason i feel like Eastern Europeans wont do the same for us as we did for them, once we are the ones in need of funding and help.... One of the main reasons im still not truly a EU fanboy.

988,"I still think Gadaffi's actions &amp; death would have occurred with or without Iraq's instability, given his history with the West. He very much was into Pan-Africanism (and thus the decoupling of Libya and its sphere of influence from the CFA franc currency) long before even Iraq was invaded. In 2009 he put forth concrete motions to create a truly African Union, with its own currency and army.

2 years later in 2011, shortly after Sarkozy said ""Gadaffi must go,"" Gadaffi was dead.

This event unfortunately coincided with instability in Syria (which is entirely fair to put at the feet of US withdrawal from Iraq and Russian imperialism) and created the refugee crisis over the following years. The conflation of economic migrants with true Syrian refugees was the toxic cocktail -- I empathize with the bleeding hearts in Germany whose conscience was taken advantage of by economic migrants who pretended to be Syrian at the crisis' peak, but ultimately they were dupes. The invasion of Iraq wasn't a source of the majority of the migrants, and the withdrawal from Iraq was only a inconvenient timing with respect to Syria and ISIS IMO. 

The true cause of the instability stems from removal of the one African dictator who held back economic migrants from reaching Europe's shores. He died because he wanted to get rid of the CFA franc and establish an African currency.

996,"&gt; What bullshit. Its MISSILES air-to-air is unmatched.

No.

The reason why the F-35(and F-22) is unmatched in the air is not because of their missiles, but because of their incredibly low RCS, which means they will **ALWAYS** detect an enemy aircraft with worse RCS before that aircraft will detect them.

For comparison, the F-35 has a reported RCS of 0.005, while a eurofigher has an RCS of 0.5. The F-35 is literally **100 times** harder to detect on radar than the Eurofighter. This makes the F-35 a beast at BVR combat.

A fight between an F-35, and any non stealth fighter will end before the non-stealth fighter even knows there is an F-35 in the skies. 

The dogfight argument is horseshit as well. It speculates that the F-35 is an inferior dogfighter because it isn't as fast as lets say, a eurofighter. Though this is true, it doesn't really matter, and here is why;

The reason why speed and agility is(or was I should say) important in dogfighting is because you try to get behind the enemy aircraft so it can't target you, while you can target it. This isn't an issue with the F-35 because of its DAS; It can target you even if you are behind it, so you can be as agile as you want, but it makes no difference because of the DAS. The DAS gives the F-35 the ability to target any threat in a 360 sphere around itself.

&gt; In a dogfight it would lose to a number of planes, including the new Sukhoi.

The only plane an F-35 would lose to is an F-22, because it has similar capabilities, but is faster and more agile. The F-35 smokes anything else.

The new Su-57 isn't even low-observable enough to be called a true 5th gen fighter. Its RCS is estimated to be somewhere between 0.1-1 which at **best** will make it 20 times more detectable than the F-35, and at worst; 100 times easier to detect. It isn't even ready yet either, and I doubt it'll ever be as India pulled out of the program and they're having major issues with getting their engines right.

Actually not a bad system.

You get your say with a wide array of options at first, and you make sure at least 50% of the voters support one candidate, however begrudgingly. 

The downside is that you can end up with two candidates on one end of the spectrum that each had like 15-20% of the votes of the first round because the other end was very fractioned and voters use the first round to let off steam and show their dissatisfaction because they know they'll gonna be reasonable in the second round.

 This happened in 2002, when in the second round the conservative Jacques Chirac ran against the ultra right Jean-Marie Le Pen. Le Pen didn't have that many votes but the left split theirs up amongst many semi-viable candidates. Chirac got confirmed with like 98% of the vote in the second round. Many left-leaning voters who disliked Chirac's politics voted for him because they were shocked and were absolutely disgusted by Le Pen.

If they are refugees then according to international conventions they should stay and ask for asylum in the first safe country. Isnt Turkey safe then?

1218,"I am not sure if I believe your claim that the allies were strong because of self interest. Because, that is exactly why they lost the first offensive of the war in 1939 in the first place. Belgium fell because they left an alliance with France, so their borders weren't prepared for the German offensive. The UK and France allowed Hitler to eat up Czechoslovakia in fear of war, which happened anyways, because they were only caring for themselves. 

Later in the war, the axis lost because of a cooperation between the allied powers, the land lease from america and the sharing of British intelligence for example. 

Unity rather than self interests is what won the war. The axis lost because they were nationalist countries who fought only for themselves, unlike the allies. Hitler didn't care about Mussolini's ambitions, Japan didn't give a shit about helping Germany's war effort, the nazis themselves even helped China against Germany's ""supposed"" ally.

WW2 is the best example as to why countries should work together for a common cause, rather than separation over self interests.

Keep in mind, Amerigo Vespucci's name was used to describe the lands he claimed to have discovered (Brazil and everything connected to it). South Americans in particular have been using America to describe themselves since a century before permanent English colonies in North America were first established. The term ""America"" became common vernacular in the US and England primarily as a way to lump all the colonies together in an inclusive way, as they were not a single political entity. And so, even then, America in the English language context was always considered to include Canada until the US appropriated the term somewhat more recently. Frankly, the popularity of 'America' when used this way within the UK is mostly due to language changes influenced by the US itself, much as other words and phrases popular in the US are creeping into UK vernacular.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/9ws76l/european_countries_above_49th_parallel/e9nowf1/,AidenTai,1542163181

Having said that, you should not indulge too many *wants* of the customer. It's up to the procurement officer to figure out what requirements best serve the underlying goals and only add those the TOR. Getting too specific with your *wants* often leads to the exclusion of creative alternative solutions. 


Honestly, I don't know anything about defense, so my viewpoint may not be applicable. To me, the IT equivalent is a customer asking for dedicated servers and then later learning he wants them to handle traffic spikes. Proper procurement is to remove the *dedicated servers* requirement and replace it with *handling traffic spikes*. Not doing so, gives *dedicated-server-companies* an advantage and is the first step to tailoring. 


I do get the gist that the F-35 blows everyone out of the water. Realistically speaking, if it was only option they should have done away with the multiple tender procedure all together. Multiple tenders only works if multiple companies can provide the service you need. If your analysis shows that only the F-35 can do what you want, why go through the farce? Just say you want to buy F-35s.

 A Typhoon costs around 100 million Euro. Germany has bought and paid 140 of those. Germany did allocate enough money to buy spare parts but to save money - in a really stupid move - the government decided that the spare parts should be bought on a just-in-time basis instead of in bulk to save cost on things like **warehousing**. The free market was not able to do this which lead to a lot of problems. Warehousing is not relevant enough to be measured in percentage of GDP.    

Your first nonsensical statement was about the 2%. In that context you would want to argue like this 'Germany has only bought 140 typhoons that is not enough. Germany clearly needs 300!' 

If on the other hand you really want to use the not fact based argument that Germany has 'only 8 working fighters' than you would want to change your initial point from 'Lol I'll believe it when they start spending 2%' to: 'Lol, first I want to see Germany address their spare part problem of 140 Typhoons only 40 are combat ready!!!'  

The first point would be quite absurd. No, Germany does not need to outspend Russia on her own. Germany does not need to spend 2% of GDP on defence and never agreed to do so, by the way. 

The second option on the other hand is what Germany is doing right now, so it falls flat as an argument in context of a future EU military. Nobody is proposing a EU army in 2019.

Again, 2% means spending more than Russia, France or the UK but without a nuclear arsenal (and without a seat on the UN security council, of course). Improving combat readiness (in this case) means spending marginally more on warehousing.

One could have an actual debate about the current planed increases and if they are enough. Maybe one would arrive by 1.6  percent of GDP for 2024 or maybe Germany needs to be the strongest in Europe and spend 3%. That discussion however should be based in actual defence needs and not in purely political numbers that were originally only thought of as a guideline for new NATO members in the Balkans.

 &gt;But my main point is that Germany hasn't been investing the billions needed to maintain thier own forces, let alone create a European army. 

'Let alone' seems to imply that pooling European defence capabilities into a common military would mean higher costs. One would expect that the efficiency would increase and not decrease.

&gt;Unless there is a significant budget increase,

The defence budget has increased every year since the Wales summit and further increases are already scheduled. 2% however is still absurd, regardless.

1592,"&gt; Byzantine had period of expansion and contraction ranging about 1000 years

And?

Also what expansion are we talking about? We're talking about Byzantines. Who constantly lost their lands to others.

&gt;At one point one of the Osmali dynasty created the Jannisaries, and that was the ""fix"". But it was basically an expanded version of the Varangian Guard

r/Badhistory

Muslims also had Ghulam elite soldiers. Who were basically slave soldiers. I guess Abbasids, Mamelukes were also Byzantines.

&gt;They inherited the exact same empire the Byzantine inherited

What are you even on about? 

Ottomans inherited no empire or kingdom. They were a small irrelevant nomadic duchy in Northwestern Anatolia.

https://i.pinimg.com/originals/86/39/76/863976460ad54f8808f499cef41be93e.jpg

Do you see Ottomans?

&gt;They called themselves the Sultenate of Rum, and Mehmed declared himself a Roman Emperor the moment he conquered Constantinople. It was pretty much that.

Ottomans never called themselves Rome and no Ottoman sultan took Mehmed II's Roman claim seriously.

&gt;Every death of a Sultan was directly followed by a civil war between his sons

Nope they were massacred. Ottomans never had a serious civil war (only civil war was after Timurid invasion). Unlike Byzantines.

&gt;The Ottoman's didn't really colonize or genocide Anatolia, they just became the ruling dinasty. The same way most of Hungary is genetically slav, despite the ruling dinasty being the nomadic huns.

Ah yes. The Turkic migration is fake. Seljuk Turks can't melt theodosian walls myth.

http://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2015/02/18/015396.full.pdf

&gt;Previous genetic studies have generally used Turks as representatives of ancient Anatolians. Our results show that Turks are genetically shifted towards Central Asians, a pattern consistent with a history of mixture with populations from this region

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4236450/

&gt;The weight for the migration event predicted to originate from the branch ancestral to East Asia (presumably Central Asia) into current-day Turkey was 0.217 (21.7%)

http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12607764/index.pdf

&gt;Moreover, results pointed out that language (Turkish) in Anatolia might not have been replaced by the elites, but by a large group of people. Therefore, it can be concluded that the observations do not support the elite dominance model of Renfrew (1987 ; 1991).

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179474

&gt;it should be noted that modern Turks are a hybrid population, comprising of the original Anatolian stock, Turkic people (i.e. of Central Asian ancestry), as well as other ethnicities from regions comprising the former Ottoman Empire.

the Ottoman Turks weren't Japanese or Chinese as Greeks and Europeans say. They were simply Central Asian. Their asian heritage was around 20-40%. 30% on average therefore. Their closest relatives are modern day Turkmens and Uzbeks (as expected)

here's the map I made

and Turkish migration has got NOTHING to do with Hungarian migration. The latter was just a single event whereas the former lasted for 4 centuries. And Hungary was depopulated various times.

If your Ottoman=Byzantine argument was based on genetics, i'm afraid it's debunked. Both Ottomans and Turks descend from Turkmen nomads that migrated to Anatolia.

I didn’t mean for my message to come off as direct comparison of stealth being equal. 

Multi-role capabilities, cost, and radar cross hair are all massive parts of fighter procurement.

The real question is what countries and purposes are the buyers expecting to hide their planes from? Most conflict areas don’t have the radar tech to even pick up an F-18.

Boeing has a great market for having none of the cheapest “modern” planes on the market that can hold countries over until they really can see whether these stealth planes are worth the cost or wait until full drone air forces come along.

1762,"My comment wasn't there to argue the opposite, but this article is just super biased and doesn't really prove that F-35 is superior.

His ten points (and my comments):

1. We have to spend more money on our military. Ok but that would have been the case with any aircraft.

2. Other countries around us chose the F-35 so it's easier to cooperate. One of his only good arguments. He also chooses to ignore the fact that France uses the Rafale and proposed an extended cooperation.

3. We made a mistake by not participating in the development of F-35, but some of our companies worked on it anyway. Ok, but what is the point regarding the purchase of a new plane? Completely off topic.

4. There is no European plane, only British and French ones. This is just playing with words, as the UK and France are in Europe. Besides, the Eurofighter was developed by a European consortium, not only the UK (there is a hint in the name).

5. The F-35 was developed in part by European countries so it could be considered kind of European. So after denying that Eurofighter is built by a European consortium, he says that F-35 is more or less European? What a joke.

6. The F-35 is cheaper than the other planes. Ok, that's the second reasonable argument here, but he doesn't talk about the maintenance costs.

7. There are 3000 F-35 orders. Well, that's ignoring the fact that even the US are considering reducing their orders by about 500 planes.

8. There will be economic compensations with the F-35. Ok, but that's also ignoring that the French offered more.

9. We buy other French military equipment so it's a good compromise. I don't see what's the relevance of the point here. It's not because we buy French vehicles that we have to buy US planes.

10. It's good for the partnership with NATO. Again, I don't see why this wouldn't be the case with any other proposed plane. Many NATO countries use other fighters than the F-35 and it's not a problem.

Really, he could have made good points with technological arguments about how the F-35 is better suited for Belgium, but instead he chose to use really bad arguments that absolutely don't prove his point. As I said in another comment in this thread, I am not an expert and don't know what plane was better, so I'm not bashing on F-35, it's just that this opinion piece is really bad.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/9wn34d/french_president_macron_i_always_prefer_having/e9mr2pb/,Pampamiro,1542134254

AfD has rising popularity at the moment, but so did all other right wing parties before them, and after one cycle they all disappeared into meaninglessness again. AfD seems to do better, because they are better at masking the fact that they are Nazis then NPD, REP and so on were.

1825,"&gt; First of, all the EU also is working hard on deepening its common foreign policy.

As I said there is an order to do things, this has to happen first. Also you are assuming this project of deepening common foreign policy will work, I'm highly skeptical, but whatever the outcome many political battles need to be fought before it's achieved. 

Who will decide when your countrymen will die? What if EU army intervenes in Ukraine or a similar situation?  

These situation make it very easy for a loose alliance to fall apart under internal pressures. See already how we have Poland, Hungary, Italy, Greece, even Austria a little. A few dead soldiers will completely ignite such situations.

I do agree that common membership of the EU smoothed the passage of the GFA and has helped in the aftermath but the key issues that perpetuated violence on either side during the Troubles were not relieved through any contribution of the EU but via the bilateral relationship between Ireland and the UK and between the UK government and the various parties in Northern Ireland.  The fundamentals of the GFA were the commitments to equality and civil rights, the change in the Irish constitution to withdraw its territorial claim, the removal of militarised security forces, the disarming of the paramilitary groups, the creation of devolved power sharing, and the mechanism for a border poll.  None of that involves the EU.  Certainly an open border and a single market helped these things bed in but they weren't the foundations of the agreement and I don't really have any reason to believe that if the UK had not been part of the EU, then the peace agreement dealing with all the bilateral issue would never have been signed.

One example : in the last years, the euro lost around 25% of value against the dollar. Do you think the purchasing power of Europeans decreased by 25%? Of course not ! But we were 25% more competitive globally.

You have to carefully weight importation/exportation for this kind of issues, and also where and at what volume and of what are you importing or exporting.

Another currency is not better by itself. And in the eurozone there is significant differences in wages and prices. But with no tariff and the same currency it is disavantadging the south of Europe. Also for global exportation, this is a burden. Why? Because if Italy was to cut salaries to the extent of being really competitive with Germany, their economy would crash because of srhinking GDP and massive loss of purchasing power.

2036,"&gt;Landesgleichstellungsgesetz

Pulled a random one:

&gt;Dieses Gesetz dient der Verwirklichung des Grundrechtes der  *Gleichberechtigung* von Frauen und *Männern*. Es fördert die Gleichstellung  der Frauen *im öffentlichen Dienst* insbesondere durch  
&gt;  
&gt;1.  
&gt;  
&gt;die Schaffung von Arbeitsbedingungen, die für beide Geschlechter die *Vereinbarkeit von Familie* und Beruf ermöglichen,  
&gt;  
&gt;2.  
&gt;  
&gt;die Kompensation von Nachteilen, die *vor allem* Frauen als Folge der geschlechtsspezifischen Arbeitsteilung erfahren,  
&gt;  
&gt;3.  
&gt;  
&gt;die *gerechte* Beteiligung von Frauen an allen Lohn-, Vergütungs- und Besoldungsgruppen sowie in Gremien.

Emphasis mine. You see how the exclusive focus (not even necessarily a preference) of women is only in very specific aspects. 

No need for English, but thanks for the offer. Are there things that disadvantage men and boys (which could and should be addressed at the same time as working) for more equality between genders? Hell yeah there are. Boys have a much harder time in schools in general. Do people give them a break? Nope. In school boys have to perform significantly better than women in sports. Does that mean they get better grades? Nope, it means double standards are introduced. Arguably these things in the formative years of a person (every person really!) weigh much higher than if some notionally female has higher chances earning 30-300x what a dull/dirty/dangerous worker gets.

Considering the government we have now, you might end up being right. It doesn't mean he was wrong though. His measures were good but the public opinion is completely detached from reality.

&gt; As for Renzi, he really did his best to appease investors. But I'm not referring to that failure. These policies that are rejected today [were his flagships too](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/12/italian-pm-matteo-renzi-electoral-reform-law-italy). So we actually have an reiteration by different actors. That's just how it is… 

Two completely different things lmao. Did you even read past the title ? Renzi proposed (and passed) tax cuts (RAI, IMU, TASI, first house, etc) that helped boost the economy. He also gave an extra €80 a month to low earning workers (now being cut by the government). We don't know whether this all reaches the €1000 mark, but if it didn't it's not far off.

This government is proposing a ridiculous tax cut implementing a flat tax while cutting investments in education and development and implementing new expansionist measures like the Reddito di Cittadinanza which are gonna balloon the Italian debt.

Renzi reduced the deficit every year while raising the standards of living of citizens. These mongs will create programs with crazy goals (such as lowering the retirement age to help young people get jobs lmao) and dire consequences.

It had been a while since I last saw such an awful comparison tbh, congratulations I guess.

Sure, a parent may go ""She looks like a man! LOL"" or whatever in passing but so what? Maybe she does look like a man. You don't get to tell children who they should like, period. If they don't like transsexuals that's none of your business, and it certainly isn't some objective truth that everyone must be willing to disregard biology to never risk hurting feelings.

2532,"Historically eastern, southern, and central Europeans were *not* considered white. White was reserved, pretty much for the English, the Scottish, and some Scandinavians. At certain times in our history, even the Irish weren't considered white. It was part of the government's official policies to prevent migration they saw as less desirable. 

The definition of white hasn't always been tied to actual, objective skin-colour. Ethnic background mattered. That said, I've never in all my life met a person that said Poles aren't white because they were historically oppressed. With whom are you speaking to and how are you finding these people? That's certainly not the position of even the most politically minded left-leaning people I've met. 

The vast majority of people I've ever spoken to ""on the left"" would never even consider someone's skin colour. They certainly don't sort people by ""oppressed vs. whites.""

Just for fun, here's an historical quote from the American general, Patton:

We can no more understand a Russian than a Chinaman or a Japanese, and from what I have seen of them, I have no particular desire to understand them, except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them. In addition to his other Asiatic characteristics, the Russian has no regard for human life and is an all out son of bitch, barbarian, and chronic drunk.”",Canada,/r/europe/comments/9wgd9y/vancouver_polish_church_daycare_vandalized_on/e9lgwsp/,Aetheurian,1542078156

2538,"&gt;I do not believe that to be the case. It may be unpleasant, but not impossible.

Just to be clear, Ireland explicitly said it would veto any withdrawal agreement that includes a hard border, it has said it will on no-account put in a hard border and you think that it'd be merely unpleasant? I ask because it seems somewhat absurd. There is no way on earth that Ireland puts in a hard border.

&gt;The EU may not have competency over border control (yet…we'll see what the transformation of Frontex to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency heralds). But it has clout.

For the EU to have competency over Irelands borders (and that's a non-Schengen border at that) there would have to be treaty change. Even Lisbon only just about grants the EU the ability to coordinate policy, and there is pretty much no-way Ireland (and a fair few other EU members) would allow the EU to impose border guards on them.

&gt;It is not reasonable for Ireland to ask the EU-26 to let Ireland hold a huge hole open in the customs perimeter of the European Union Customs Union.

It's not, but then that wouldn't be what Ireland is asking, and it wouldn't be the result. Moreover, while it wouldn't be reasonable, it would absolutely be in line with Ireland's interests.  

&gt;his is not ""the EU is being mean"" but ""the EU is doing what is has to do to have a functioning customs union"". There is no alternate option for the EU. That's just part of what having a customs union is — customs checking must happen on things that enter into the union from the outside.

I would expect Ireland to check customs and enforce EU customs rules, it just wouldn't do it on the border (much as the EU has said it would be happy with off border checks if the border were in the Irish sea..). If the EU had concerns, it could add additional checks between it and Ireland (Ireland being an Island makes that relatively easy).

&gt;Ireland might stall or something for a bit, but at the end of the day, I do not believe that there is any realistic way that it can simply avoid it. Maybe it could get spot checking with more-severe penalties for enforcement, but that still means a border checkpoint with at least some random subset of traffic checked.

Again, the EU suggested off border checking for the 'Irish sea' solution, so they have sort of boxed themselves in. Moreover, the enforcement measures available are pretty slim. The EU could fine Ireland if they think there are actual breaches, but they'd have to show the impact and of course Ireland and the UK cooperate on things like cross border smuggling (excise goods etc..) now so it's not as though that isn't possible.

&gt;What you're proposing in practice is redrawing the EUCU to exclude Ireland — Ireland effectively becomes an outside country.

Not at all, Ireland would still be in the customs union with the same rules and tariffs would still be applied externally, not to Irish goods.

&gt;The EU could no longer know that anything coming from Ireland didn't incorporate components that, for example, EU tariffs had not been paid on. I'm not actually certain that EU membership without being in the EUCU is practical, for that matter.

It isn't, but happily for Ireland there is no mechanism to remove Ireland from the EU (or the CU) and as long as Ireland enforces EU customs rules, there isn't a lot the EU can do to require a particular type of border.

&gt;Irish businesses would have an advantage over non-Irish EUCU businesses otherwise, since they could be obtaining material without EU tariffs on them. And the UK would be running off with whatever (lower) tariffs they were charging to as a toll to insert stuff into the EUCU.

Only Irish businesses happy to break the law would have an advantage, not quite the same thing.

&gt;So, you probably have one ""deal"" option that doesn't partition the UK, doesn't put a RoI-NI border up, and doesn't require the UK to cancel Brexit. That's EEA membership (or some equivalent).

We'll see, but the UK isn't going to partition the UK, nor is it going to put in a border on the Island of Ireland and it isn't going to remain in the EU or join the EEA either! I suppose that might mean a no-deal exit, but more likely it'll involve a customs agreement (not customs union) and FTA. 

&gt;Any other agreement is going to mean the EU requiring the RoI to put up a border.

And Ireland saying no, including on a no deal. There is simply no way that the EU manages it, it is absolutely fundamental to Ireland and it has been for longer than it has been an EU member. what's more, this isn't Ireland's 'fault'. I can't see Ireland fundamentally undermining itself to keep the EU happy when it has any other option. And right now, it does.

&gt;So, okay, maybe a UK-EU FTA or something goes through, though I think that it is really late in the game for that. But an FTA doesn't make it possible for the EU to let the RoI not have a customs border there.

A UK/EU FTA with a customs component does, and there are neigh on two and a half years left to negotiate that assuming the expected transition period in the withdrawal.

2620,"The UK's exceptions exist for 1 of 2 reasons. First there are the 'Because otherwise the UK would have excercised its right to veto the project' exceptions, like the Euro and Schengen. 

Let's be clear. These are not exceptions the EU has granted the UK, these are projects the UK has allowed the EU to proceed with, on the understanding that the UK not be required to take part.

Then there is the rebate. The reason for the rebate is that the EU is incapable of arranging its spending in such a way as to justify the amount of funding its formula would have the UK provide. Without the rebate, the ratio of EU spending in the UK to UK funding sent to the EU would be roughly 1:6. This is clearly absurd, and the UK would rightly veto any budget introduced under such terms, until the EU was forced to massively increase spending in the UK to match its spending Germany or France, something the EU is neither willing to do nor really capable of doing, since it can't simply hurl that money at farmers as it does in france. So a compromise was reached whereby the UK is refunded 2/3rds of the hypothetical net contribution, and the ludicrous 1:6 becomes a merely extortionate 1:2.

As to the best interests of Ireland, I'd suggest that an acrimonious no deal will damage them far more than an FTA with a customs border.

2656,"&gt;All this tells me is that he is Islamist enough for the Mullahs or/and docile enough for them. That's it.

And who did tell you that? Made up claims. At least try to have some argumentation.

&gt;Because the voting lists are predetermined by the mullahs. Iran is a theocracy mascaraing as a democracy. Not that it matters anyhow, since their form of government has nothing to do with why US is so against Iran.

And the votes in the US are predetermined by how much you have in your bank account, or if you have enough lobbies pn your side. But going back to Iran vs Saudi Arabia, you never truly answered me as to which one was the worst. 

&gt;A system where representation of administrative regions is more important than a total vote is present not only in US but in some European countries as well, for example in UK. It's a perfectly legitimate system and doesn't make elections somehow undemocratic. And while it's a shame that US system ended up with 2 parties, by constitution there could be any number of parties and candidates, US ended up with 2-party system due to historic reasons. It's pretty bad but, I agree, but the fact that you equalise it with Iran is actually a legitimate joke.

How so, explain me how people that went to vote in Iran are a ""legitimate joke"", you are basically insulting them for no sane reason.

&gt;No, it is completely and utterly irrelevant. Of course US doesn't care about whether Iran is democratic or not. There is no reason to dig up historical archives to figure it out, you can only look at what countries US is supporting just next to Iran. But to think that US is vehemently against Iran because they are butthurt due to what happened in the 70-ties is equally ridiculous.

Whether you are utterly naive or brainwashed, I can't decide. Of course the US hold a grudge against Iran because of that. The countries next to Iran that the US is supporting are regimes that were either established by the US itself (through wars, example Iraq), or vassals (Saudi Arabia), any country that decided to be more independent from US influence (like Iran in the 50's) were violently attacked, mainly through coups d'état. If this had been avoided, Iran would be by now a secular developed nation, and would have never experienced the Islamic revolution that was ignited by a deep anger of Iranians against the tyrannic regime that was forced upon them by Americans, what you sow you reap.

&gt; Once Iranians toppled the Shah, Iran immediately became hostile to the max towards US, Israel and other US allies in the region and started a pretty aggressive foreign policy. And since they declared US as an enemy, obviously US will treat them as such. What else do you expect them to do? Say 'sorry, calm down, we won't do it next time'? And US doesn't care about what Khamenei and conservatives celebrate there. They want to bring the downfall of the Islamic government, whether their approach is right or wrong is a completely another discussion but they think it is.

Yes they could have said ""sorry"" for the coup d'état that replaced a democratical secular regime under Mosaddegh to a tyranic one under the Shah all of this because of oil. That would make sense don't you think?
And if the US doesn't care about what Khamenei and conservatives celebrate there, then it becomes cristal clear as to why the US sucks that much in terms of diplomacy. Trump is helping the islamist conservatives to take back the power, and you don't see what's wrong with it? Why do you think other nations that signed the Iran treaty stayed despite the US leaving? Because Iran was really doing an effort to change and cease its arms race, Iran was checked regularly by independent commissions under the UN controlling if Iran respected the deal, and you know what? Iran did it. Can you say the same about North Korea now? Read the article I sent you earlier at least. Trump is a fool, and is easily fooled by a fucktard like Kim Jong Un. Gosh.

&gt;Lol. Khamenei is a as afraid of popular will as MBS or Assad or Sisi or other MENA rulers are (except for Tunisia nowadays).

Ever heard of these huge demonstrations occuring in Iran. I guess not, you seem to despise this country and Iranians themselves, and you don't go beyond what you believe is true. Khamenei is totally afraid of the popular will, if he wasn't he wouldn't have allowed Rouhani who goes against his own interests.

&gt;Sure, and sure. You seem to be out of the loop but North Korea and South Korea are actively moving forward to peace and, in turn, the end of North Korea's isolation. 

The only serious fact is that Kim Jong Un in contary of Iran for now isn't renouncing the arms race, but keep living in your fantasyland. North Korea is not making any progress and is closed to the rest of the world, same can't be said about Iran. I've met a lot of Iranians while doing exchange student programs, but Ive met no North Koreans at all, even when I was studying in China. This country is a prison, there is no comparison possible with Iran at all.

&gt;The difference with Iran? Iran still continues the anti-American rhetoric

Hahaha, sure. And North Korea loves the US now as [we can see here](https://brandinginasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/anti-american-propaganda-Branding-in-Asia.jpg), also [tell that to the family of this poor lad](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-northkorea-detainee/u-s-student-held-in-north-korea-died-of-oxygen-starved-brain-coroner-idUSKCN1C22XM)

&gt;it still continues to threaten American allies. Destruction of Israel is still their goal. 

Oh really, that's why Iran has one of the biggest jewish community of the whole middle east right? And it's not like Israel itself is benevolent towards Iran either.

&gt;So I absolutely understand Trump's (and not just his, the entire Republican party's and a huge part of Democratic party's, if not the majority of them) position regarding Iran. 

You understand Trump? Wow you may be the first then. And stop saying such bullshit, the Democratic party was in favour of the deal (they made it), the position regarding Iran is quite different than what Trump wants.

&gt;Is it a right position? Maybe not, but it's absolutely not an illogical one and definitely not a position out of butthurt like you seem to believe. Trump maybe is a grown up child but the vast majority of American establishment are not and the feeling of butthurt definitely doesn't guide their foreign policy decisions.

The US through Trump is anyway playing it again solo, other nations chose to stay bound to the deal that was promised. You think a little bit more as to why the US is so lonely in the world stage as to Iran, who is wrong here? The US or others?

Several of the reactor shells have thousands upon thousands of cracks (some &gt;8000), to the point where even a 2°C change of temperature in the cooling water would either make one of the shells in Tihange collapse or lack the cooling capacity required to prevent nuclear meltdown.

Belgium's overwatching comission is relatively openly corrupt with massive lobbying, and all regulations are effectively out of the window.
They even started to ignore the EURATOM treaty years ago, because otherwise they couldn't keep on with this.
At least three states (Bundesländer) and several counties &amp; cities are even sueing them over this, but Belgium just prolongs the trial to infinity.

After the Brussels Attacks it was also uncovered that ISIS had placed some of their people in the nuclear plants' staff working in high-security areas, plus having high-ranking employees including their kids down to the kid's kindergardens under tight surveillance. The Belgium military had to put the facility under emegency-lockdown (to this day) and lay off all non-undispensable staff.

Yes, it IS that bad. All those things. Look up the reports.

And this is not about whether nuclear plants *can* be operated safely or not, it's about Tihange and Doel specifically *being* operated extremely far from any reason and safety hoping to cut costs to slightly increase profits.

I live in Aachen, the city bordering both Belgium and the Netherlands, which is considered the first to be hit (and hit most severely) in Germany by Tihange. Our city has been preparing for this for several years now, and even started to hand out free Iodine pills and funding the production of small-children-sized gas masks to ditribute among kindergardens, because they apparently weren't available on the market.

2713,"&gt; Coming up with this as a solution requires some serious mental gymnastics.

It doesn't. Because we already have the exact same model with the nursing care insurance. People who don't have children pay 0.25 percentage points more. 

&gt; If you want to incentivize people to have kids, instead increase the maternal / paternal leave and give them increased governmental grants.

And who will pay for that increase? Everyone. Which means if only people with children can make use of it, people without children will be punished. 


But since you're okay with that, here's a comproimse. The unavoidable increase in pension contributions will be applied to everyone. And instead of punishing people without children, we'll just reimburse people with children and return some of the amount they would pay more.

While the Nazis managed to become the strongest party, they had lost voters and had received less than a third of the votes (33,1 %) and less than the ""centrist"" parties (SPD, Zentrum, DDP, BVP, DVP = 38,1%). Because of the communists, neither the extreme right nor the centrists had a majority.

Hindenburg, who had appointed chancellors with his emergency powers since 1930, first hold on to von Papen, then appointed von Schleicher as chancellor. Both led a very conservatice, technocratic cabinet, only supported by the DNVP (8,8 %). Hitler and Papen made a deal that lead to Schleicher being ousted (and murdered a year later). Hitler replaced him as chancellor, Papen became vice-chancellor, the cabinet stayed the same. Still, no parliamentary majority.

Only a later election, March 1933, resulted in a majority of 51,9 % for the coalition of NSDAP and DNVP. Yet these elections weren't free anymore: SA- and SS-members, now auxiliary policemen, made sure that only one party could conduct a campaign.

that's the excuse that they keep repeating to themselves in order to justify their choice. But the EU was never just a trading bloc. From the very beginning (1957, almost 20 years before the UK joined) the founding nations aimed for the ever closer union, as stated in the treaty of Rome. You can argue on the timing of it, but the end goal was always to integrate further and further. 

It's just that the 1970s UK was so desperate that it chose to ignore this part and glossed it over.

It's much deeper than that. Class, culture, religion, looks (not related to color) all play a factor as well. But so does identity.

2795,"&gt;Notice that Rouhani was actually almost not allowed to govern Iran, the conservative Islamists didn't want him at all.

All this tells me is that he is Islamist enough for the Mullahs or/and docile enough for them. That's it.

&gt;And what do you mean by not properly elected? Iranians voted for a reformist (even against the call of Ali Khamenei that wanted someone sharing his view), how is this illegitimate?

Because the voting lists are predetermined by the mullahs. Iran is a theocracy mascaraing as a democracy. Not that it matters anyhow, since their form of government has nothing to do with why US is so against Iran.

&gt;What should we say then about Trump that didn't even win the popular vote and got elected in a system that allows basically only 2 parties to rule (others are insignificant and the system doesn't allow plurality because money is essential to have a chance).

A system where representation of administrative regions is more important than a total vote is present not only in US but in some European countries as well, for example in UK. It's a perfectly legitimate system and doesn't make elections somehow undemocratic. And while it's a shame that US system ended up with 2 parties, by constitution there could be any number of parties and candidates, US ended up with 2-party system due to historic reasons. It's pretty bad but, I agree, but the fact that you equalise it with Iran is actually a legitimate joke.

&gt;Oh yes it really is relevant, it actually makes clear why the US is against Iran, not necessarily because of the supposed undemocratical regime, but because Iran removed a tyrant with US intelligence that backed coups up. It is relevant to understand why the US broke their word, and terminated the promising Iran treaty, by doing it, Iran will rearm itself, and you can say goodbye to the reformists  [Khamenei and conservatives are already celebrating that, all they want is remove Rouhani, and they never wanted this treaty, what Trump did by ruining it is basically a golden opportunity for them to reverse the ongoing movement for reform.](http://time.com/4787856/trump-islam-speech-iran-rouhani-conservative/)

No, it is completely and utterly *irrelevant.* Of course US doesn't care about whether Iran is democratic or not. There is no reason to dig up historical archives to figure it out, you can only look at what countries US is supporting just next to Iran. But to think that US is vehemently against Iran because they are butthurt due to what happened in the 70-ties is equally ridiculous. Once Iranians toppled the Shah, Iran immediately became hostile to the max towards US, Israel and other US allies in the region and started a pretty aggressive foreign policy. And since they declared US as an enemy, obviously US will treat them as such. What else do you expect them to do? Say 'sorry, calm down, we won't do it next time'? And US doesn't care about what Khamenei and conservatives celebrate there. They want to bring the downfall of the Islamic government, whether their approach is right or wrong is a completely another discussion but they think it is.

&gt;He isn't the supreme leader, but he actually is the head of government and he does have a great power, Khamenei can rule him out or cancel his decrees, but by doing it he coud take the risk to go against the popular will.

Lol. Khamenei is a as afraid of popular will as MBS or Assad or Sisi or other MENA rulers are (except for Tunisia nowadays).

&gt;And please stop listening to such garbages with Kim Jong Un wanting peace, [he is basically fooling easily Trump](https://www.gladstoneobserver.com.au/news/un-says-north-korea-still-producing-nuclear-weapon/3485170/). And what was the Iran treaty according to you? Less serious than the word of Kim Jong Un? You can't compare Iran and North Korea, you can't even compare Iran to Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia hasn't even any election.

[Sure](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45569924?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/cp78wz6vexet/north-koreasouth-korea-relations&amp;link_location=live-reporting-story), and [sure](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45572375?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/cp78wz6vexet/north-koreasouth-korea-relations&amp;link_location=live-reporting-story). You seem to be out of the loop but North Korea and South Korea are actively moving forward to peace and, in turn, the end of North Korea's isolation. The difference with Iran? Iran still continues the anti-American rhetoric, it still continues to threaten American allies. Destruction of Israel is still their goal. So I absolutely understand Trump's (and not just his, the entire Republican party's and a huge part of Democratic party's, if not the majority of them) position regarding Iran. Is it a right position? Maybe not, but it's absolutely not an illogical one and definitely not a position out of butthurt like you seem to believe. Trump maybe is a grown up child but the vast majority of American establishment are not and the feeling of butthurt definitely doesn't guide their foreign policy decisions.",,/r/europe/comments/9wd15t/khashoggi_case_french_multinationals_refuse_to/e9l0gny/,dancedor,1542063355

&gt;""Before the arrival of migrants in Germany there were 300 stabbings per year; today, 3,000 people are stabbed yearly. So, a ten-times increase,"" Pernar said.

&gt;In response to Pernar's video, Croatia's main fact-checking website, Faktograf, issued its own findings, which show that, according to official German statistics, last year saw the smallest such number of offences in the last 25 years.

Crime rates as a whole came down. (Police was busy with other stuff?) Incidents where refugees were involved skyrocketed.

2822,"&gt;and suppresses wages. 

But immigration doesn't suppress immigration. This is just ignorant. The empirical evidence is unambiguous - immigration is good for high-skilled wages, neutral or slightly beneficial for low-skill wages, and very beneficial to the economy overall. 

When people argue to restrict immigration, what they're really saying is ""I want you to pay higher taxes to support me in my old age, because I'm scared of brown people."" 

Immigration to the U.S. isn't even that high, by historical standards. 

&gt;The intent during the debate in our Senate explicitly said it was not for visitors.

Again, this is just ignorant. During Senate debate, they said that it wasn't intended to apply to (1) the children of foreign diplomats and (2) untaxed Native Americans.  That's it. Of course, immigration was completely unrestricted then...

It came up. They discussed it.

Children of immigrants? They were citizens. Even children of Chinese immigrants, who themselves weren’t eligible to naturalize? Yes, them too. Mysterious foreign “Gypsies,” who supposedly spoke an unknown language and worshipped strange gods and observed no American laws? Yes, the sponsors explained, it covered them too.

2847,"I mean, the EU *can* rewrite A50 to not be a forcing function producing exit at a deadline,

That being said, it would require treaty revision, would require the UK to support it, and more to the point, has no purpose.

If every EU member wanted Relationship X between the EU and UK, then it would happen, regardless of A50.  The bar required for a Brexit agreement is the same as one required to change the EU treaties.

I think that if I have to be realistic, if I go back looking for a root cause that could be changed, it goes a ways back, probably to Maastricht.  That's where EU popularity with Britons fell off to the point that approval never consistently strongly exceeded disapproval.  And either at that point or in the subsequent period, having ongoing low approval was always going to be dangerous.  Whoever is responsible for ""selling"" the EU to the public had to do something then.

All actions after that point that produced the present situation were more-or-less forced by that.

* UKIP formed.  That's the right thing to do if you really oppose something strongly.  And they met the extremely high bar of having a large chunk of the electorate single-issue vote on a FPTP issue — it's not as if the British political structure was terribly conducive to Brexit.

* Cameron agreed to referendum.  While it makes me wince, it's hard to say that the Conservatives should just suck up the political pain here of doing what a lot of people were very much opposed to and keep ignoring the Leave crowd.  If his gamble had succeeded, he'd also have established a political basis for the UK remaining in from there on.

* The EU did not extend major concessions to Cameron likely to change public opinion.  The points that Britons were unhappy about were also the points that the EU could not really afford to do much on.  Kill migration, and you kill a major engine of integration.  I think that if Merkel could have know that a Leave result would happen, maybe things would have been somewhat different.  But the EU's position was not unreasonable, particularly with the information available.

* Britons voted for Leave.  We already knew that the vote was at least in risky territory.

* May opted not to try to ignore the referendum.  I this would be far harder for her than Cameron not having the referendum.  I think that complaining about this is pretty unwarranted.

* Ireland presumably drew a ""no border or veto"" line.  I think that Ireland is making a bad move here (this is one of the points that I think most-likely could have changed), but it's also understandable that they want to make that gamble.

* As a confederation, it's hard for the EU *not* to extend a veto to all members.  Can't ask for that.

* The UK drew a red line on policy that effectively cut off part of the UK, and in combination with Ireland's position, effectively produces a situation where no-deal is the only option.

That gets you to where we are now, with a likely no-deal.

I think that the most-clear error was not addressing low public opinion some time back, via whatever mechanism.

&gt; Is Emmanuel Macron having a meltdown?

&gt; The rapid decline of the French President

&gt; Gavin Mortimer


&gt; Emmanuel Macron was elated when France won the World Cup in July. The photograph of him leaping out of his seat at the Moscow stadium showed a leader at the peak of his power. Or so he thought.

&gt; Ever since then, he has been bumping back to earth. Last week, the French President took the unusual step of retiring to Honfleur for four days’ rest and recuperation. ‘His face has changed, he is marked by the weight of power,’ confided one of his team; another expressed concern about the President’s weight loss.

&gt; Part of his deterioration is self-inflicted. Macron likes to boast that he gets by on four hours of sleep, and his texts to ministers in the early hours are legendary. In the 18 months since he came to power, he has made 170 official visits in France and 66 trips overseas.

&gt; Caught off-guard by the flurry of speculation concerning his health, Macron emerged from his retreat to tell locals that ‘All is well, so don’t worry.’ ‘I’m not slowing down,’ he added. But this appearance hasn’t stopped the press gossiping about his drawn features and ‘first grey hairs’.

&gt; Macron’s weariness isn’t just down to his workload. Since July he’s suffered one setback after another. Some have been serious, others less so, but together they’ve eroded his aura of invincibility. Most surprising of all, given his poise in the first few months of his presidency, many of the setbacks have been of his own making.

&gt; None more so than the Benalla affair, the scandal that erupted three days after the World Cup final. Footage was broadcast of the President’s bodyguard, Alexandre Benalla, beating up a protester during a May Day parade. The public were appalled, not just at Benalla, but at Macron’s advisers who tried to lie their way out of the crisis. In doing so they stripped Macron of his moral authority. He was no longer the new president for a new France; he was just another president who abused his position and then tried to cover up his misdemeanours.

&gt; How could Macron have been so stupid over Benalla? Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the former Euro MP who is in Macron’s entourage, has said that the President and his wife liked and trusted Benalla. He was an organiser, a confidante and someone who could lighten the mood with a wisecrack. They didn’t want to lose him and that misplaced loyalty clouded Macron’s judgment. Perhaps, too, there was arrogance involved. The comparisons with Jupiter and the Sun King, the invitation to the White House, the sense that he was emerging as the strongman of Europe. Had he begun to believe the hype?

&gt; Macron spent his first year in power hectoring and lecturing people, and his leadership style alienated some of his ministers. First to resign was Nicolas Hulot, the popular environment minister, who announced his decision in a live radio interview in August, citing his frustration with government policy. Others followed: Laura Flessel, the sports minister, and Gérard Collomb, the experienced minister of the interior, who told journalists that there was a ‘lack of humility’ in the President’s administration, warning that if he doesn’t change ‘he’ll end up isolated’.

&gt; That is now happening. Not just within his own administration but also within the EU, where Macron has few friends among the other 27 leaders. Since coming to power, he has insulted Poland, Hungary and Italy. His cherished ambition of forging a new alliance with Germany is dying alongside Angela Merkel’s political career. Fourteen months after outlining his vision of a ‘profound transformation’ of the EU, Macron increasingly looks like the only leader who still believes in the Brussels project.

&gt; Last week he used a newspaper interview to warn of the spread of a nationalist ‘leprosy’ across Europe. Macron likes the ‘leprosy’ metaphor; he used it in June when making a veiled reference to Matteo Salvini, the Italian interior minister, who is seen in Paris as a dangerous populist because of his hardline approach to mass immigration.

&gt; Macron, by contrast, is the progressive — or so he would have us believe. In truth, he’s making little progress in his own country. In late September, his approval rating dropped to 29 per cent, with ‘arrogant’ and ‘superficial’ the words most commonly used by those polled to describe their president.

&gt; Macron came to office with a promise to reform France. He eased many restrictive labour laws, abolished much of the punitive wealth tax and modernised the state railway operator. But the momentum he gained has been offset by a slowdown in household spending as well as rising fuel prices. Macron is hoping he can pacify people with tax cuts. These will take effect in the next few months and are supposed to boost family purchasing power, a priority for many French voters.

&gt; But tax cuts can help only so far. On the other issues that concern voters, Macron has been impotent. The footage that went viral last month of a 15-year-old boy holding an imitation gun to the head of a teacher in a Paris school shocked France. Violence is so endemic in French schools that education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer is considering sending in the police. Macron has done very little to tackle the problems surrounding immigration, radical Islam or inner-city violence. The arrest this week of an alleged far-right terror cell, said to be in the early stages of plotting an attack on the President, is disturbing evidence of the fury some in France now feel at the state of their country.

&gt; He is at least fortunate that the centre right Républicains and the Socialist party remain in ruins 18 months after their collapse in the presidential election. Meanwhile the far-left leader of La France Insoumise, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has run out of impetus, which leaves only Marine Le Pen to capitalise on the President’s troubles. A poll this week put her National Rally party ahead for next year’s European elections, but it is hard to imagine her running in the 2022 presidential election after her disastrous performance last year. It is more likely she will step aside to make way for her niece, Marion Maréchal, who seems more likely than her aunt to unite the right under one banner.

&gt; Macron has a respite this week from his domestic strife as he hosts 60 world leaders to commemorate the centenary of the end of the first world war. Merkel will be among them and the German Chancellor and the French President will convene in Compiègne, where the Armistice was agreed. It will be a sombre occasion, not just for its historical significance, but because of what the pair represent: the worn-out leaders of two countries whose people are angry and divided.

2909,"&gt;For years youtube has seen its costs increase and its rentability go down.

So you are saying that without harsher copyright regulations, Youtube's business model is already unsustainable. That seems like a separate issue for them to handle then. But if we really look at it, we don't know how much Google makes from it, or how much they lose on it. It doesn't really matter, since Youtube is a good investment for them even if it loses money, since they get people in the Google ecosystem with accounts, have them spent time on their platform instead of others and can retarget based on viewing habits. Video embeds and app usages gives them even more information. And they are moving towards subscriptions, that if they manage to do it right can make them billions.

&gt;The article 13 is extremely badly written and one of the aspects of the stupidity is the fines.

I specifically mentioned that there are solid complains about it. But Youtube is not addressing those, they just want it gone. Fines are completely normal, why else would companies follow the regulation if there is no enforcement.

&gt;What we have seen in the last months in terms of copyright strikes and demonetization will increase tenfold.

No, what we have seen over the last months is Youtube attempting to appease advertisers. Nothing to do with copyright. But Coca-Cola doesn't want its brand next to racist, sexist or otherwise hateful messages. Which is a totally valid concern of them.

&gt;I mean we are talking of a youtube where everything you don’t make by yourself is in danger (ex : film yourself with a skateboard of a brand and be copyrighted because you didn’t pay the brand the rights).

This is nonsense and you know it. This kind of talk is exactly what we shouldn't use, because it distracts from having a honest conversation about the issue.

&gt;Even more crazy are you aware than right now companies are being created only to buy uncopyrighted free music so it can strike people who used the music prior to the buying (so even legal free content today can be illegal content tomorrow by retroactive effect it s crazy).

Sounds like a licensing issue. You can't just randomly buy free music if the owner doesn't want to sell it. And if the owner had bothered to put the right licenses on it to make it free, they couldn't just remove that. This is an issue of people not looking at the actual licenses of the music they use. It sucks for them, sure, but it has nothing to do with these new regulations.

&gt;No wonder youtube has campaigned agaisnt this article it s a mess.

None of the points you mentioned have anything to do with the new regulation though. I get people don't like copyright and there is abuse going on, but Youtube doesn't care about that. They only care about the impact it might have on their bottom line and come with sad stories about how this can impact people on their platform, as if they have ever cared about that.",,/r/europe/comments/9wfan1/youtube_ceo_calls_eus_proposed_copyright/e9kfyht/,cissoniuss,1542047504

Because Rouhani is not the true leader of Iran. Because Iran continues and has no plan to stop acting against America in the region, nukes or no nukes. Kim Jong Un actually wants peace with South Korea and actively works towards it. It has nothing to do with 'morality', democracy or even nukes.

2993,"&gt; Of the many provisions in the treaty, one of the most important and controversial required ""Germany [to] accept the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage"" during the war (the other members of the Central Powers signed treaties containing similar articles). This article, Article 231, later became known as the War Guilt clause. The treaty required Germany to disarm, make ample territorial concessions, and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers.

Bla bla bla. Literal nazi propaganda. The treaty was less harsh than the one imposed on France by Prussia in 1871 and France managed to pay off that no problem. German industry was intact. The only reason their economy tanked was that they fucking tanked it themselves. They also repeatedly got extension of the repayments.

The treaty was also a hell of a lot less harsh than Brest-Litovsk that the Germans imposed on Russia. 

As for ceding land, yes, that happens when you lose. Prussia forced France to cede lands in the Franco-Prussian war too. Again, France didn't fucking go genocidal because of it. 

And of course Germany had to accept the fucking responsibility for the war they fucking started. They literally invaded a bunch of countries and fucked shit up and killed a ton of their people.

2997,"&gt;First of all, why are you bitching and ranting at me?

You misread my tone and I possibly misread yours as well. I was discussing the situation and assumed a tone by your challenge. Given this comment I think my response challenging your implied assertion that demographic change wasn't that big of a deal was correct. It's not a rant, it's refuting the insinuation I think you're making.

&gt;Second of all, it's labeled as racist &amp; xenophobic because you're targeting specific countries;

I disagree that it's being viewed as racist because we're targeting specific countries. I think it would be viewed as racist no matter what we did, but I agree that Trump is not doing it in the best way. Hell, immigration has gone up since he's been President. He's failed so far and my hopes are now quite low.

&gt;Central North America would still be ruled by native tribes if the mass immigration of tens of millions didn't skew the demographics, but I don't see you complaining.

Yea, that worked out so well for them. Why should the USA take on an immigration policy that doesn't favor our citizens because people were bad in the mid 1000's? That's insanity and no one else is doing that. If you believe this, then the Netherlands should lead on this topic, but they won't as we all know. We just want immigration policies that are similar to everyone else in the World.

&gt;Do you also agree that the popular vote not mattering in presidential elections is absurd?

Yes, I do. Nothing I can do about it and that's an entirely different topic.

&gt;No mention of slaves or visitors.

This would be the debate about textualism vs intent when running courts. Funny enough, people who want to remain true to the text here also believe that we should have policies like gun control regarding the 2nd amendment. I don't really care, but it's obviously hypocritical. The entire debate around the text made it clear that it was not for them and it has been abused. I don't take these arguments seriously as the other side clearly has malicious intent here and is inconsistent as suits their needs.

3068,"Yep, though you have to be Dutch. I’m not sure why, but The Netherlands, while of course not problem free, seem to be closest to a positive democratic utopia in Europe. Most people vote, a lot are conscious voters and radical parties never actually cross a line enough to be dangerous, as the progressives step in. I think it may be the level of ubranization population density and how the “countryside” looks and feels. As for the lack of divide it’s really shocking. I mean a close Dutch friend of mine lives in Axel in Zeeland, so a very small town of I think less than 10 thousand. But from the way it is built, the architecture, the compactness of it, and well the atmosphere (sorry for being vague but it’s hard to put a gut feeling in words) it just seems ubran, compared to rural areas in some other countries. I mean the way people talk and act. Poland is more sparesly populated and places like the East and poor parts of Mazovia have bery different looking small towns and villages. I mean they are more spread out, the people differ more from those from the big cities and some of the places just seem desolate and old (depopulation of the country side in EE Europe really makes some villages full of only poor old people who did not have it in them to move). These places basically forgotten by the government will vote for populists, radicals and get frustrated. I mean there are whole powiats in Poland were bus service de facto stopped existing as communist state provider went bankrupt long ago and no private companies want to do it. Others will have a 20 year old Autosan bus come to their village twice a day. Meanwhile Warsaw has an all low floor bus fleet with almost two thousand buses (thanks to own and EU funds) and is now almost done replacing the oldest low floor ones with new ones, with air-con and lcd screens. While air-con is useful, though in Poland only needed a few times a year, putting in LCD screens that display pics, news, city promotions etc when other locations can’t even afford bus service at all is a great metaphore for modern Poland. While Warsaw, Krakow, Poznan, Gdansk/Gdynia and some other cities are de facto Western now and despite lower wages the quality of life is not lower than in the West (as prices are cheaper), the rural areas lag behind. And the gap is looking more US or Russian than European style with each passing year. My friend who is in college had an interesting “real life” lesson about social and economic aspects of Poland. It was the tale of how internstional chains like McDonald’s and other fast food or supermarket chains arrived and spread. And western amounts of such places in the cities are common for 20 years now. They started coming to more rural areas later and while stores closed the gap, even when you look at a map of all McDonald’s or KFC locations there are wide gaps, especially in the east. Regions which have population centers, but few or none McDonald’s in them - the lesson was inspired by a mayoral candidate for Sokolow Podlaski who became a meme for promising a McDonald’s if he won. That seems totally abstract from Warsaw, but there are facebook groups from such cities wanting a fast food place. Despite most cities of it’s size having the “golden arches” Sokolow is in a poor area and so is seen as the corporstion as not able enough to support a restaurant, which opens it only to franchise places, which is still Ok, as probably 2/3 of McDonald’s are franchised. But locals with the money are rare and franchisees from bigger cities don’t want to risk it.

So all in all, if there are villages that dream of and towns that dream of McDonald’s in 2018, there are places where life is unimaginable for people like us. And sadly that means they also can vote unimaginably. Anyway, probably boring you to death with how long my posts are, but as an expat in Poland I’m fascinated by it’s transformation, though I still now very little about the desolate villages which vote out of frustration as I see them only from car kr train windows and their problems like the two above seem like from a different world.",,/r/europe/comments/9w4ugd/poland_independence_day_march_on_the_streets_of/e9k7uk0/,JoseMikey,1542041129

As noted by someone else, the conscription limit at the beginning of the war was 20 years-old. Here, the age group is &lt;15yo - you can possibly lie on your age and decrease it by 2-3 years, but it's way harder for most people to do it by 5. Not saying this isn't possible or wasn't done, but it's likely to be overall insignificant. For the 60+ group, there is no reason to lie about your age as, in any case, you're likely not going to be drafted at 50+ years-old (the limit is at 48yo, above it, you wouldn't be part of the army or again, numbers aren't significant).

I think it'd be OK if we stuck to one letter combination to represent one sound, as it is any given combination of letters can be one said one of about 5 different ways.

I have to say Italian being phonetic is *really* helping me learn it. Because practising reading and writing is effectively practising speaking.

For the geeky amongst you (and we're on reddit here, so that's a majority!), I think of it as a check sum for the language: if the adjectives agree with the noun you've understood correctly, if they don't, ~~reject and ask for retransmission~~ you have misunderstood.

As to English's regional variations as an 18 year old who'd never really left Essex, I came to Birmingham and I genuinely left a Chippy with some Cod Roe based thing that turned out to be awful, because despite the fact we were both speaking English we completely didn't understand each other.

In most Slavic languages, the word for bear is some kind of combination of Med+Ved “he who knows.” So, the name Medvedev here means “of the bear.”

But wait there’s more... The real name of the cave bear was something like Arcturus (depends specifically on which language).

3237,"I’m talking about Poland and Germany mostly. The anarchist vandalism in Germany is appaling to look, not only during demos, but the number of graffiti (the mindless not the artistic type) is just shocking to look at in many districts. While Poland where the far right is supposedly on the rise looked like that in the wild 90s and now looks cleaner and vandalism is more rare. I mean Polish cities safer and cleaner than German ones? Tha’s f-ed up. That’s something nobody would believe 15 or 50 years ago. But if the supposed rise of the far right in Poland meant violence, I would be of course furious. But for some reason it doesn’t. Media always blows the very few racist or potentially racist attacks out of proportion, but they are so very rare in Poland. I mean Poland may not have a lot of full time living foreigners of different culture and or skin color, religion, but it does get it’s share of students, tourists etc as it’s cheap to live and gets those massive Israeli trips each Spring, not only to Auschwitz, but also Orthodox Jews visiting shrines in usually small and very right wing Polish cities, like the massive decent on Lezajsk. Violence? None. Warsaw has two working mosques and two working synagogues. These don’t have extra protection, even on independence day. A total of one act of vandalism ever happened, some windows cracked and broken at a mosque in a supposed racist attack. The guy was obviously drunk (obvious in CCTV), was caught fast and can hardly be described as far right, but more a career criminal with a long history of crime and prior to mosque attack against Poles and Polish institutions, so not a far right dude, just typical low life scum.

So as an expat living in Poland I see the things not adding up. Cause if Poland is so far right as mainstream media suggests with most marchers being facists and yet is so safe, than, well this proves that the far right can be very crime free.

If on the other hand the far right’s real numbers, say on the march, are as Poland states (like the small ONR and MW groups, together maybe 200 out of 200 thousand) than they still can be violent as a group oer capita, as with such a small group we wouldn’t see it. But that would mean the mainstream especially Western and liberal media is lying big time and making Poland a scapegoat for some reason, which is a bit shocking, so I’m not sure I like it this way better and safety levels make it impossible to see a third option.

I am not a fan of the Polish government, but I’m also baffled why it is shown as in line with Orban’s in Hungary. I mean maybe because Poland can’t be bullied by international corporations so easily - like with absurd Sunday shopping ban, Orban did it and than repealled it fast under pressure. Poland did it and no repealling in sight despite much opposition to it and a somewhat bad effect on the economy. But Sunday trade bans are child’s play compared to authoritarian style moves, like expelling universities or the super weird banning homelessness. Such things happen in Hugary, not in Poland. Polish opposition, like the civil disobedience leftist groups (Obywatele RP, KOD) don’t get in trouble even though they have tactics like occupying the parlament, getting into the parliament in car bonnets breaking all security rules or vandalizing the parliament building with grafitti. I mean try that on the Bundestag or Capitol. They also state Police brutality and make fake accounts of it (so primitve that we get a hospital set up with a broken arm and massive bruises of an activist live one day and than an interbiew with him totally fine the next morning, on the same tv station, so the propaganda is so primitive). While what the society sees is the government innaction to punish oppositionists, the supposedly brutal police not using batons, water canons, gas or tasers, just bare hands when it is attacked and spit upon. And than we read MSM repeating lies of leftirst groups with zero public support, which manage 20-200 people on demos, though Poland has more liberals, most just won’t stand with people who break the law for personal gain.

So please come to Warsaw for an amount of time, or just view say opposition and msm claims versus videos of said incidents online. And you will see why the far right may have an easy footing here, as they are the option that does not break the law (other than some slogans or flares, but that is fleeting and doesn’t destroy stuff or harm anyone)

Of course in due course the slogans may actually be more dangerous and give birth to true terror as we’ve seen in history, but for now Poles don’t see that. They see lies about Poland in most respected main stream media, Poland as the main skypegoat and they see marches of 200 000 people which leave no destruction and even very little trash for such an amount of people gathered for any cause.

So it really depends on where you are coming from and who you call the far right. The Norwegian dude I actually forgot about as I was not thinking about Scandinavia while writing it and you do have a huge point there. As for Brazil, I don’t even know what to think anymore, I mean their new president is terrifying, but I can kind of understand why a lot of people voted for him. I mean I think 17 of the 25 most dangerous cities of the World are Brazilian for years now. It’s been turned into a slaughterhouse and clesrly the liberal/leftists prior government could not or did not want to do anything about it, so people are fed up. We’ve seen it also in the Phillipines, where it was supposed to turn into a far right masaccare, but the weirdo Duterte only implemented a few of his policies and while sadly killing drug dealers without trail was one of them (and I’m fundamentally against doing stuff without trail or capital punishment) the overall level of violence affecring normal citizens did fall, so it’s hard to judge, as it’s only natural for people to want safety for the law abiding citizen.

Sorry for the VEEEERRY long reply, but a lot of people are under the missinterpretation that I’m defending the far right, while I was just trying to show the reality of a central European region which is so lied about it’s just scary",,/r/europe/comments/9w4ugd/poland_independence_day_march_on_the_streets_of/e9jsenm/,JoseMikey,1542026092

3251,"Well another fact here:

1914 and 1918 where the bloodiest years of the war. Not trench battles but the war of movement was the worst time in WW1 to be a soldier.   
On August 22 1914 27.000 french soldiers died in a single day. As a matter of fact without the German high command panicking and sending reinforcements to the east (which didnt help at the battle of Tannenberg so they didnt change the course of war there), even with a withdrawal from the Marne Germany had a chance of winning in 1914 due to the unthinkable high losses of the French armies. 

Germany had also large offensives in 1915-1917 but on the Westfront really only Verdun(where the French lost more men) and some offensive actions around Ypes (not 100% sure if I am overlooking something...) but on the Eastern Front they were constantly advancing but the Russian army was not as formidable in defense as the Germans where in the West.  


So the high Entente casualties where because of their losses in 1914, more offensives against a competent army in 1915-1917 and also the 100 days offensive - while taking lots of prisoners - also meant the Entente was still taking more deaths in 1918 than the Germans.

This is the total population, including population that can not be mobilized (women, young children, too old to serve). Out of these 39.6M - which is the population of mainland France, excluding the colonies -, ~12% are over 60yo (too old) and 26% are under 15 yo (likely too young? Not sure what was the conscription age limit). I don't have the exact numbers on hand, but assuming there should be an almost equal man/woman split in this age bracket (16-59), that would mean there was only ~12.5M men able to be mobilize.

Out of which, 8.4M indeed were. France mobilized the two third of its male population. And that still includes all people not fit for service (I doubt a 50 or 55+ yo. would be fit, and anyone with a disability).

(feel free to correct me, as I feel like I might have make some errors/forgot some stuff)

Edit: some more numbers

Out of these 8.4M, France lost ~1.3-1.4M (not counting ~350k civilians, mostly malnutrition and diseases). Meaning that it lost 10% of its male population, in 4 years. And this isn't taking into account wounded and impaired soldiers at the end of the war.

3347,"No, just the cold hard truth. Without Yugoslavia Croatia would either be under Austrian and Hungarian control, if AH survived, or under our and Italian control if it did not. No Yugoslavia means the treaty of London that got Italy into the war is realized, feel free to look up what it would've looked like. Simply put there was no way for an independent Croatia to happen in 1918. The only way it could spring up after this would be in the leftovers Austria and Hungary got (unless we and the Italians gobble that up too) or as the NDH in WWII though this would end even worse than it actually did. 

So Croatia went from being loser in WWI set to be carved up to being an independent state in the borders it mostly wanted (lacking HB of course) all thanks to becoming a part of Yugoslavia. How is that not massive profit? Acceptable loss of life too for the most part. Compare that to us going from victors that could've had anything to ending up with Vojvodina but without Macedonia and ultimatelly even Kosovo compared to 1914, and our peoplebeing split between 3 countries, plus the existence of the Milonegrin and Bosniaks, all for a measly 2 or so million dead.

3373,"Yes, you are.

First of all, if they were indeed fascists, they would be forbidden from existing as an organization altogether, as the 13th Article of Polish Constitution states. And yet, despite marches being organized under the lead of two different parties across the years, the march itself was at the very least prohibited.

Second of all, although this is a strict technicality to be frank, fascism and nazism/chauvinism are two different things. Some, not all, fascists were chauvinists. The ideology itself is nationalist in heart, just as communism is based on equality for all people. It's kind of why i'm labeling this as a technicality, because the ideologies themselves don't look outright terrible, but then people start attempting to incorporate them and it ends terribly regardless of whichever side does it.

Christianity doesn't support hate based on the race, skin color, etc. So why is every march happening after the Holy Mass? 

I do agree that inviting Nuova Forza to the March is a really dumb idea, but pinning Government as a party supporting this is wrong, for several reasons. The biggest one being the fact that it all seemed to happen very ad-hoc - President Duda just a few days ago stated that he's not going to participate in this march. But even disregarding that, after learning that italian neofascists are in the march, their part of the march, their column, so to speak, moved a lot faster as to not associate with them.

But I think the worst statement is this one:

&gt; Organizers are fascist = march is fascist.

Hundreds of thousands of people participate in this event not because Nuova Forza was invited. They probably don't even care who is officially behind the organization of the march. They are out there to celebrate 100th anniversary of Poland regaining independency. Despite the scale of the event, every year without fail, the scale of the damage is practically non-existent in comparison to the size of the event. By calling the march fascist you're calling every single family participating in it for all the right reasons fascist. This is dehumanizing.

Poland wasn't destroyed by fascists. It was destroyed by nazis. German nazis, to be precise. The main reasons we're all here now are patriots of the past, who have shown great dose of bravery, love for their country and its people. The remaining few for the most part participated in this event and i've yet to hear a single complaint about either one of them.

3395,"Since an anarchist society is neatly impossible to exist without a revolution, the wealthy and powerful will be the first to oppose us and then to be disposed of. Then, since everyone is equal, it is for them to decide how to govern themselves. We prefer direct democracy. Whether a new upper class will arose or whether the people prefer to all stay equal is to be seen. I would personal oppose all kind of upper or lower social class. And anyway.  If an anarchist revolution is to happen that means that a lot of people would be in favor of a classless society and direct democracy, so just putting back a plutocracia is unlikely, at least for some generation

3411,"Idk how to feel about this. I mean there's been all this talk &amp; media reporting about how the march was being hijacked by facists and far right nutjobs, neo-nazis, racists etc etc... This image gives off the hooligan vibe as well tbh. The scene it looks angry &amp; rageful. I mean do you really need flairs and so many of them just to mark one day??... So any to anybody who was actually there can you clear things up n answer and tell me what it was actually like there??, There seems to be alot of conflicting reports regarding just how far-right or not the march was??...


PS. I asked on another post, but this one seems to have waaay more Poles commenting on it. Way more traction.

But so since its Poland's 100 years anniversary of idependence, Polski's National Day as shown by this epic large march etc, as a non-Pole i know next to nothing about the place.

&gt; I’ve been living 20 years near the river Somme and I can tell that this map is only accurate for the 10 years following the end of the war. After a superficial cleanup, the lands have quickly been reused, especially in northern France where it was vital to grow cereals again.

Also, in the comments

&gt; I lived in Compiegne in 1990 and was told not to wander too far into the forests

This article, Article 231, later became known as the War Guilt clause. The treaty required Germany to disarm, make ample territorial concessions, and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers.


&gt; the reparations figure was excessive and counter-productive, views that, since then, have been the subject of ongoing debate by historians and economists from several countries.

3493,"&gt; This couldn’t be further from the truth. Italy is still the 7th largest exporting country in the world. Most of which is done towards Germany , france and US. Hence why the Euro doesn’t work for us.

Look at the balance of trade from 1991 to now for Italy:

https://tradingeconomics.com/italy/balance-of-trade

From 2000 to 2012 it was negative.

&gt; When we could devalue our currency (up to the 90’s) we could compete much better, wages were rising, and gdp was on par with countries like france and uk.

Not true. Look at the history of economy of Italy:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy#Economy

&gt; Effectively, after a strong GDP growth of 5–6% per year from the 1950s to the early 1970s,[184] and a progressive slowdown in the 1980-90s, the country virtually stagnated in the 2000s

During the 80s and 90s where Italy had it's own currency, growth was slowed down.

The greatest growth was from the 50s to the 70s, just like in Greece.

The reason behind this is globalization: as soon as competition started to became global, those with no competitive advantages started to get behind.

&gt; Now we have been stagnating for 10+ years while losing 1/3 of our industries and we’re being asked to keep doing this (that is austerity) cause “it will be good for us”. No it won’t, it might be good for other countries but it’s a slow burning death for us and we’ve got the last 10 years’ track record to show it.

Globalization is at its peak right now and has been for at least 15 years.

It is no coincidence that Italy's growth started slowing down just exactly at the same time as Greece's. The common factor is globalization.

3610,"I am tired to explain the ""prosperity"" of the Czech lands under the Duel monarchy. Yes, the country has improved significantly, but so did the rest of Europe. The economic failure of Bohemia was more evident with far more consolidated Germany prior WWI. There were truly only 20 years of prosperity between 1867-1914. Era between 1873-1879 was a depression followed an economic stagnation lasting till 1892. Sometimes, it is called rolling recession, when an economic growth in one year was followed by recession in the next year. The outflow of population from Bohemia and Moravia was tremendous, about 1/6 of population. About 500,000 Czechs arrived in the USA. Some regions were totally depopulated by 1890 and never recovered to the population peak it had in the middle of the 19th century. The country did lay out to the foundation of the modern Czech nation, but it was far from flourishing decades. There were entire impoverished areas of Czech lands, like Wallachia, eastern and southern Bohemia, and the southern Sudetenland (called the poor Sudetens). These areas, like Zlin, Hradec Kralove, achieved a prosperity in the interwar period. Zlin actually grew into the wealthiest city in Czechoslovakia by 1938. The Austrian government deliberately undermined having universities for Czechs, like in Brno, which was a power struggle between the Germans and the poor Czechs. Many Czechs went to study abroad. The university of Brno was established in 1919 because Moravia was unable to achieve its university learning under the Monarchy. Olomouc allowed only theology seminary, and this was only using a German language. he majority of Catholics in Bohemia and Moravia were Czechs, yet both archbishops were Germans, so did the bishop of Brno. Almost all church hierarchy from the Archbishops to the main parish churches, monasteries, and schools were Germans till 1918. Czechs lands were nothing more than secondary province that only grew because of the others. Austria did not care whatsoever anything about it, for them the priority was Vienna and Budapest. Can you name one public building that was built by Monarchy in Prague that was made from the imperial coffer? Even the National Theater and the Museum were built from donations.",,/r/europe/comments/9w38mz/on_this_day_100_years_ago_austriahungary_ceased/e9jasl7/,kaik1914,1541997472

3613,"&gt; back then we were able to devalue our currency and other such measures to make up for it. Now we can’t.

But my point is that devaluation is not necessary for you. A country with a current account surplus of 2.5% of GDP is highly competitive in export markets. It's not your currency. You're growing slowly because of low productivity, which is completely unlinked to the currency you use and is more about internal factors.

There's this meme in Italy that the euro is the root of all ills. But your current account balance - unlike Greece which really *was* held back by the currency - is in the strong surplus territory. It's not the currency. You're competiting with the outside world just fine. It's the internal factors to do with low productivity growth. Whether you use the lira or the euro is completely beside the point, because neither currency will magically fix those. Only deep structural reforms can.

3620,"When French occupied Bohemia in 1805, they were shocked to find country that was still devastated by 7 Years War that ended in 1763. Prague was nothing more than a pile of rubble recovering from the siege by Prussians. The countryside was doted with burned villages and manors by the war and uprising of 1775.  1/6 of population in Bohemia died in famine in 1773 and its effect lasted til the start of the 19th century. Bohemia only achieved economic recovery after 1815, but the era between 1650-1800 was really terrible times for the Czechs and even Germans. All money that were taken from Bohemia were put into economic recovery of Hungary. This was very common grievance by Bohemian representatives from 1683 till 1914.

Because I also use Krakau as a german I didn't have problems with switching, it's just easier sometimes to use both languages. I don't think this person wanted to disrespect the polish.

Just curious, would you use wroclaw or Breslau? Just looked it up and there is no English name for it. I know the official name is wroclaw but I have zero idea how to pronounce it correctly so I probably would use Breslau in an English conversation

A small group with barely any public support which does stunts like trasspesing into the sejm in a car bonnet (which would get them in jail due to anti terror laws if it was the Capitol or Bundestag, but they are never guilty in Poland) or which stated that they would block the march if they deemed it illegal. I mean a 20-30 peoplemstrong group of supposed „liberals” supposedly „guarding the law” that states that the law is basically in them and they can stop 200 thousand people if they think it’s right? I mean that’s facist dictatorship methods by a group who calls everyone facists. So wierd and twisted. Thankfully the cops didn’t let them cause a scene, but the social media posts alone make me worry that when the opposition takes over after PiS it can be even worse (if the politicians help the „street opposition” guys into parliament and let them start from their lists, and judging by municipal elections, they will). So as a leftist and liberal I am afraid of what PiS may do and hope next year they will at least nead a coalition and not have the majority. But I’m also afraid what would happen if the opposition, supposedly my option won and these vigilante “super humans” (as the 20 of them knows better than the 200 thousand and can enforce it’s will on them), are waay to close to fascists. I mean the current government may be closer by slogans, but is actually bery weak when it comes to punishment for opposition people braking the law. While those opposition people seem to be natural born dictators pretending to be liberals. And we all know what “I am the law” types turn out to be when they are in power.

It takes like 3 months at the minimum to train people just to be infantry (even more for the more important specialized forces like tank or helicopter pilots). If war broke out between major powers then you would have huge bombing campaigns and tank movements well before any of that happened.

3895,"Of course, transgender and intersex are a small minority, but this does not mean we should not help them. It is not hypocritical to point this out. Hypocrisy would be if someone said we have to help transgender and intersex people, but should not help people with mental illness. I have never seen anybody say such a thing. It is plain obvious that both groups of people require help. In fact, a very large number of gay, lesbian, transgender and intersex people face depression at some point during their lifetime - due to the way in which they are maginalized and stigmatized by society. 

Regarding your question of what policies would help intersex and transgender people: First there are many practical things regarding things like the availability of advice/councelling, sex changes in your passport, availabilty of surgery for transgender, and so on. But probably the most important thing would be to reduce, if not end, discrimination of transgender and intersex people. And a very good step forward towards thiss aim is to make information about intersex and transgender people part of the school curriculum. The ridicule and belittlement some people have displayed in this thread shows how necessary this is.

Finally, the Scottish move that has been criticised and ridiculed here does not only apply to intersex and transgender people, but also to gay and lesbians, which stil face discrimination and have a significantly higher rate of depression and suicide attempts. And looking at all groups together that are to be included into the school curriculum, we are not talking about a tiny minority anymore.

4040,"&gt; Still there is virtually no damage after these marches

[Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/7c8hcl/1111_beware_of_smiling_families_with_children/) I posted collection of links to videos from the marches (those 2011-2014) where you can see the damage in action.

To understand why some of the marches get violent and others not, one needs to learn the timeline:

- pre 2011 - The march is fringe event, attendance is small (few hundreds), hardcore nationalists only. 

- 2011-2014 - Attendance raises to tens of thousands. Football hools join, as well as ""smiling families with children"". Riots and vandalism occurs. Anti government (centre right PO+PSL coalition) speaches are made. The vibes are anti-leftist, anti-communist (commie = centre right, liberal, etc.), anti-secular, anti-EU, anti-immigration, etc.

- 2015-2017 - With change of government to populist catholic nationalist PiS, the march gets more calm. However, the messages on banners get more radicalized (white supermacism). The attendees feel more confident, as the the march enjoys passive support from the ruling party.

- 2018 - Special edition, because of the 100th anniversary. The government and the president decided to ""take over"" the march and join with the state organized celebrations. Probably to exert more control on the attendees and avoid scandal.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/9w4ugd/poland_independence_day_march_on_the_streets_of/e9i8riy/,wodzuniu,1541968556

4151,"About 40% of our *electricity* is already produced by renewable energy. The largest other part of energy consumption is transportation, which is largely oil based. We will certainly have a shift towards more electricity in that area within the next 20 years.

I have read (by people who certainly calculated it better than you or me) that getting out of coal by 2030 is feasible even while phasing out nuclear energy. Of course there would still be gas, which has its own issues (mainly its major supplier, Russia) and is of course also a fossil fuel, but much better than lignite. And it has the advantage that it works well with renewable energy because gas plants can be turned on and off pretty quickly. Additionally, the gas can be produced by excess renewable electricity (at suboptimal energy efficiency, but still), which may eventually even replace imported natural gas, at which point it becomes a green technology.

&gt; the fact that Germany has not the ideal conditions for 100% renewable energy production

Yes.

What you're referring to is an exclusively positive connotation the term mainly carried during the 18ths and 19ths century. Sure, civic nationalism for example is also a (positive) form of nationalism.

[But so are all the other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism) (note the sidebar) connotations of the term: From Nazism, ethnic nationalism, racial nationalism and all the way to the modern ""alt-right"" movement, all of those are *nationalist* ideologies at their core.

Odds are, if you openly refer to yourself as a nationalist nowadays, especially in Europe where all the states are well-established, then you don't care too much about the German states being able to finally unite as a country or securing the independence of the Baltic countries from the USSR.

*That* is why the term has an (accurate) negative connotation nowadays and *patriotism* is the commonly accepted more positive version. That's also why you very rarely see people advocating for e.g. civic nationalism consider themselves nationalists - simply because that's the normal thing to do in most of Europe and the term is reserved for much more extremist viewpoints.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/9vyrlp/on_this_day_100_years_ago_an_armistice_was_signed/e9hmtze/,rEvolutionTU,1541954619

It only stated Kosovo got autonomy, not independence.

4366,"I’ll answer a few of these:

As for which country I would prefer obviously Poland but I would like to live all over Europe. I have a love of England romantic poetry and other art and love the country along with Ireland.

Most poles(like all) are uncut as is usual in Europe.

Poland is catholic and religious due to it being a part of the identity. In the commonwealth to be a Pole meant to speak Polish and be Roman Catholic. Your ethnic makeup could be tartar or Rusyn or Lithuanian. That has stuck around to this day. Even if you don’t really go to church or pray you will get your child baptized and first communion.
In fact first communion in Poland is a big celebration akin to almost  barmitzvah with whole family attending and party and gifts.

I don’t think Poland was let in EU “too easy” Poland has been a bastion of liberal values and tolerance for most of history. We are only free for under 30 years, this hiccup doesn’t mean we weren’t ready to join EU. We obviously progressed huge amounts.

Pan-slavism is not big because pan-slavism is Russian centric bring dominant Slavic ethnicity by population. As you know Russians are our one real historical enemy. I love west Slavs, south Slavs, and would live in Ukraine easily. 

The race questions uh Poland is like 99% white it would be very bizarre and not accepted for obvious reasons. It’s not due to racism more like families want their children to marry Polish people obviously as most countries barring Anglo-sphere.",,/r/europe/comments/9vycin/on_this_day_100_years_ago_poland_regained_its/e9hdf02/,Hjhehhshs,1541947226

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarymaps/comments/81zp17/european_federation_concept/) is the original thread. See that thread for a few responses. Here is a summary:

* This is not a manifesto. I make imaginary maps (mostly alternate history) as a hobby. I guess I would like to see something like this happen, but I don't actually expect it.
* I am aware of all the translation errors. I used Google Translate. Errors are inevitable.
* When I make maps there is a balance I strike between realism (or rather plausibility) and aesthetics/creativity. For example, I initially had the big obvious cities as capitals, but then I thought that was boring, so I got creative with it.
* The whole thing started as an exercise in trying to get the regions as balanced as possible in terms of population. It doesn't work, I can tell you that. That's why some of them are a bit weird. 
* I built the regions as aggregations of NUTS-3 regions (with the exception of Strasbourg) downloaded as shapefiles from  Eurostat. The reason you can't see the IJsselmeer is because parts of it are included in the NUTS-3 regions.
* To quote one of my responses in the original thread:

&gt; Meh, it's not an official proposal to a parliamentary commitee, it's just something that I do on weekends because I've got no life. Besides, reddit doesn't offer any way of editing a submission, so I would have to reupload as a new post and it's not really that important.

* Don't @ me.

From the Supreme Headquarters 12:00 hours, November 4, 1918

The war against Austria-Hungary, which the Italian Army, inferior in number and equipment, began on 24 May 1915 under the leadership of His Majesty and supreme leader the King and conducted with unwavering faith and tenacious bravery without rest for 41 months, is won.
The gigantic battle, which opened on the 24th of last October and in which fifty-one Italian divisions, three British, two French, one Czechoslovak and a US regiment joined against seventy-three Austrian divisions, is over.
The lightning-fast and most audacious advance of the XXIX Army Corps on Trento, blocking the retreat of the enemy armies from Trentino, as they were overwhelmed from the west by the troops of the VII army and from the east by those of the I, VI, and the IV armies, led to the utter collapse of the enemy's front. From the Brenta to the Torre, the fleeing enemy is pushed ever further back by the irresistible onslaught of the XII, VIII, X Armies and of the cavalry divisions.
In the plains, His Royal Highness the Duke of Aosta is advancing at the head of his undefeated III Army, eager to return to the previously successfully conquered positions, which they had never lost.
The Austro-Hungarian Army is vanquished: it suffered terrible losses in the dogged resistance of the early days, and during the pursuit it lost an enormous quantity of materials of every kind as well as almost all its stockpiles and supply depots. The Austro-Hungarian Army has so far left about 300,000 prisoners of war in our hands along with multiple entire officer corps and at least 5,000 pieces of artillery.
The remnants of what was one of the world's most powerful armies are returning in hopelessness and chaos up the valleys from which they had descended with boastful confidence.

100%. NZ actually had a crazy figure, something like 1.5% of its population, killed because so many signed up and went off to Europe to fight. That generation still referred to 'home' as the UK a loyalty to the British family of nations was very strong.

4518,"I always thought that the Bayonets were not allowed for the Bundeswehr. They are just not really official in Germany

&gt;The German Bundeswehr does not use bayonets, although several versions have been developed for the G3.

&gt;Introduced since 1997, the G36 has a standard bayonet mount, but special bayonets have not been developed. The AKM bayonet type II (M 74 and M 74/2), which was temporarily taken over by the NVA as a ""fighting knife, heavy"", had to be modified on the retaining ring in order to be able to be planted without removing the muzzle flash damper. For this purpose, the original retaining ring has been replaced by another one with a larger diameter. In addition, the leather belt holder has been replaced by a new one made of synthetic fibers and plastic, which is compatible with the Soldier 95 Bundeswehr carrying system. This change was not made officially, but in private initiative in limited numbers.

&gt;Eickhorn developed without official order under the name SG2000 (side rifle) a bayonet for the G36.

4605,"Such a pointless conflict. Millions of working class men died for literally nothing(infact really the only way you can feasibly imagine and say those men were sent to die for good reason is if you genuinely believe in maintaining the well-being of the British Empire. Because that was the point of the war from the British perspective), and were killed by the ruling elites/monarchies(in many ways WW1 was actually somewhat of a family feud between the various European royal houses. For example Queen Victoria was Kaiser Willhelm II's grandmother. Tsar Nicholas II was related to the British &amp; German monarchies too, hell George V of England and Tsar Nicholas Ii look near identical.. i digress) just to serve their egos, the retarded paranoia and Empire building ambitions of these out of touch aristocratic generals, kings &amp; politicians. A great shame. To this day the scale of the slaughter and carnage is still crazy and beyond comprehension.


All the troops should of mutinied and refused to fight, easy to say in hindsight now but back then i guess people were less critical of authority, were more willing to believe what they were told back then. Or maybe they just wanted to leave their dull, drab, tough, boring &amp; poverty affected lives behind and see the world, experience some action(dont forget most ppl at the time thought the war would be a quick &amp; painless one, they had no idea of what would actually happen).. which explains why so, soooo many men volunteered to serve(before constcription was brought in). Either way they didnt have the same access to amount of info we do today, only the propaganda. Which can and does blind people to the actually reality of what's going on. Which is why we still see States invest countless amounts of money into pumping out PR &amp; propaganda.

EU countries most certainly didn't have a similar level of education, language or culture - nor, for that matter, basic values. Not too long ago France would have preferred immigrants from Mali or Algeria than Bulgaria or Romania. I'm not even sure that has changed until today.

Some similarity you see today is a result of systemic efforts to make that happen. We have no reason not to apply the same systemic efforts globally.

Second of all, I was not in fact talking about EU countries only. The most prosperous countries in the world are those who have (or had until recently) a very liberal attitude to immigration, countries which didn't obsess so much about identity and culture and instead used immigrants as manpower to fuel their economy. 

Values change over time, and there is an uninterrupted trend in favor of liberal values globally. But that trend relies on countries which embody these values sticking to their principles.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9w0lwd/afd_at_22_and_in_second_place_among_men_7_and_in/e9h086n/,jtalin,1541925415

4633,"Perhaps you're right, I'm not that familiar with internal German politics after all. However, in my opinion, it seems like Germany is still somewhat ""stunted"" in a way it chooses to behave - compared to its actual size, value, and clear importance in the region and the world. It constantly gets assaulted (unfairly) by neighbours and other states around the world, being accused of imperialism or something of the sort, while, in reality, acting in the least assertive way out of all the European states of higher echelons of importance. In the end - it's often seemingly forced to retreat to ""Atlantic solidarity"" and other such nonsense instead of following its obvious personal objectives by the squeals of its haters. 

I cannot imagine France, for example, ever acting this way, and if it's not because of some sort of WW2 legacy, then I'm at a loss to understand the basis for these types of behaviours. Nonetheless, it troubles me, because what this leads to in the end is the rising popularity of radical forces that have no problem declaring their allegiance to straightforward German national interests, not dampened by any pretty words or confusing concepts - which is not the kind of future I want to see for Germany.

4689,"Well, that's an extremely long argument that we could possibly be getting into here, but let me just say that I **categorically** disagree with the statement that USSR was, in fact, on the brink of collapse before Gorbachev's ""reforms"". There was an economic crisis, about the size of 2008 one in Russia, which made it look likely that some contraction would have to occur. The thing is that the ""collapse"" predicted by the Soviet economists was not even in the most pessimistic projections going to reach the size of the real disaster that befell the Union republics after 1991. There was a outflow of currency which was endangering consumption potential of the Soviet population? Definitely. However the real outflow of currency through the oligarchs, offshores, massive increase of consumption of foreign goods and services, combined with loss of all foreign and most of the domestic market by the indigenous industry created the conditions from which we have (collectively) only recently started to climb out of - some a little better, some worse. The ""reforms"" failed miserably and produced a colossal collapse precisely where it tried to prevent it.

The DDR withdrawal was (partially) an attempt to gracefully exit from a situation that was in danger of unravelling on its own, but had Kremlin really treated Germans as a natural enemy that is to be hated and feared, they would have held on for as long as humanly possible.

Anyway, that's hardly the point that I was trying to make here ;). I've already put it another way elsewhere - pretty much all ex-Soviet people have absolutely no ill feelings towards Germans anymore. Whatsoever. There's a lot of respect and even certain affinity - probably through the long-term historical cooperation that lasted for centuries before the World Wars turned it all around. You can contrast it with attitudes towards the British, who, while being allies in both World Wars, have consistently inspired deep mistrust. At least that's my view of the situation.

Even if this story is accurate, as far as I know, it is not illegal to give a boat fuel who has run out, nor is there any requirement to take the boat back to Malta.  Sure, they probably could guess that the people involved were aiming to illegally enter Italy, but they've no legal obligation to process people heading for Italy.

In the case of ships being sunk, that's a different matter — Malta cannot just unload people into Italy.  But they aren't conveying people in this case.

4726,"&gt;Got a proof they are fascist?

Hmm, let's see.

&gt;Demonstrators with faces covered chanted “Pure Poland, [white](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/12/white-europe-60000-nationalists-march-on-polands-independence-day) Poland!” and “Refugees get out!”

Last year's march was fascist as fuck.

&gt;""I'd say some people here do have extreme views, maybe even 30% of those marching, but 70% are simply walking peacefully, without shouting any [fascist](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41958199) slogans,"" he told the AFP news agency.



30% is a whole fucking lot. I'd say it's pretty safe to call it a fascist march when 30% is actually shouting fascist slogans. Thinking it's ok cause the other 70% is silent, borders utter retardation. That's a nonsensical argument. Staying silent doesn't mean they reject it or disagree with it. Quite the opposite. That's how it all begins. By enabling it.

Last year's march was fascist AF and PiS even [paid](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-politics-farright/polands-far-right-opportunity-and-threat-for-ruling-pis-idUSKBN1ES0BK) for it.

First of all it’s not “if” the story is accurate. The Maltese haven’t even denied it. Second of all, they do have a legal duty to respond to distressed persons at sea and, if they claim asylum, which they did, to bring them to the nearest port, which in this case was Malta and not Italy. To avoid having to take responsibility they eventually led them to Italy. This was not just providing them with supplies, they also led the ship for over an hour towards Italy.

Nonsense, people (nation) matter, not arbitrary states (governments). Hitler was chosen by Germans, he did not invade them and force them to carry out his evil plans. Moreover, grandchildren of Nazists still take part in German's politics. 

Let's use your example. Right now Turkey invaded Kurds and want to annex they land, because... they claim it belong to Ottoman empire, so should be Turkey's.

The only exception is when a country is occupied. For instance, France during Vichy government. Or DDR (East Germany). Or Poland between 1945 and 1989, where the USSR held military forces and ruled by their puppet politics.

Being from Belarus, I have a huge chunk of my ancestors perish during the war, as does pretty much everyone with deep roots in this area. Yet I know nobody who would consider throwing any sort of judgement at Germans for that all these years later.

Crimes and mistakes, moral or otherwise, should be acknowledged in order to not let them be repeated. However flagellating yourself over them is not going to do anyone any good. Everyone in Europe had some sort of a quarrel with everyone else, and everyone in the world had some sort of a quarrel with someone in Europe. All that happened, yet all of it is also in the past! We should try to help poverty-stricken countries to come out of their disastrous situations, sure, but due to simple feeling of human solidarity - not any sort of internalised guilt over past oppression that happened many decades, if not centuries, ago.

Listening to the people that got hurt with a sole purpose of inviting judgement is a faulty and self-destructive premise. And I say this as a representative of a nation that can hardly be seriously accused of anything atrocious by anyone at all. It's not a self-serving theory - I just truly think that such exercises are futile and open the way up to being dominated by far less moral and more shrewdly shameless players out there, ready to extend their influence due to their self-imagined (though absolutely false) moral superiority.

I know that it's not just that and none of it is this simple, but Poland is surprisingly right-wing overall compared to the European as well as regional, East-Central European, average. It might be a temporary phenomenon, due to certain demographic and political factors very specific to Poland that I got to observe first hand in the 90's, such as the ubiquitous ""It will be heaven on Earth with no drawbacks"" pro-EU propaganda, that eventually led to a certain disappointment in certain sectors of the population who were then drawn away from all the parties that controlled the Polish political life in the first decade since PRL (practically none of them really exist anymore...). I feel like this might change eventually, at least I really hope so.

4856,"I, as an American, can never truly know what it is like to have a major war on my own soil. I will never understand how it is like to see my cities and my lands turned into heaps of rubble and into piles of mud. 

The sheer scale and ferocity that led Europe to consume itself. All the petty nationalism. All the alliances. All the hate between fellow Europeans. All ultimately for nothing. Nearly 17 million people dead from the fields of France to the desert sands of the Middle East. Either to die from an artillery shell or by drowning in a sea of mud. Millions of men to die for almost nothing, only a general or king's piece in a giant war of chess between empires.

There is some good that came of this, and the even more devastating war than followed it. Europe began to cooperate and grow together, rather than just withing their own borders. Former enemies became allies. Decades of hate became decades of friendship. Countries open their borders to their fellow European neighbors. They shared the same currencies and customs. They traded with one another and fought together. 

However, both my own country, and the Europe I am proud to call my allies and friends, must not forget their history, nor how the modern day civilization got to this point. We must remember this war and all the wars before and after it to understand why we are as peaceful as we are now. Fellowship and brotherhood are more powerful than hate and destruction. Lest we forget.

I promised myself, when I visit Europe one day, that I would visit the memorials and major sites of both world wars. I must see in person why war and violence will never be the right answer in solving a problem, or else we are doomed to consume ourselves in strife once more.

Europe, I am proud to share a history with you, and your people. My grandfather came here when he was a boy, and because of him I came to terms with my roots, and there's no other people I'd rather share a friendship and relationship with. These last 100 years have shown a lot of what peace can do. Thank you, and let us remember the men who died to give us this peace.

Then read more.

&gt;The Seljuk migration was in no way big enough to replace the HUGE Anatolian population of Syriacs, Armenians, Greeks etc.

Actually it was. Or it was big enough to make a genetic difference. Also Syrians and Armenians were mostly replaced by Kurds. By the way you seem to forget that these migrations also brought raids and depopulations with them. Farmlands were constantly raided by nomads, and this resulted in famines and the Anatolian Greeks escaped westwards. There were also dozens of cities burned down in Anatolia. While it's true that the Turks didn't replace anyone, they were by no means a small minority.

&gt;Modern Turkish pepole have different genetic make ups

The difference is mostly limited to geography. But most Turks have common ancestors. Anatolians (not Greeks) and Turkmens.

&gt;Tatars and Circassians originate from a Turkic group but they are also racially far from their ancestors genetically

Tatars and Circassians are irrelevant. Besides Circassians are not Turkic. They're Northern Caucasians.

&gt;Turkic but they are far from Turkic and the vast majority seem to be just as Anatolian

Turks do not cluster with Anatolians. Turks do not cluster with Turkics either. Turks are, rather, [a mix](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--V-XfQN2E_4/W1xF0xn2LaI/AAAAAAAAAhU/xZBNwXR7Uvghhv6ShUZp-Pqwh1_NkVHyACLcBGAs/s1600/37321556_142785006605860_867305762811019264_o.jpg)

4983,"As Donald Trump met Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Saturday, he was beset by potential diplomatic embarrassment.



First, the French newspaper Le Monde reported that on a previous diplomatic occasion in Washington, the American president caused embarrassment by mixing up the Baltic states and the Balkans.


Then, amidst ceremonies in the French capital to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war, a planned presidential visit to the American cemetery at Belleau, a site of immense importance to the US military, was cancelled because it was raining.



Amidst brewing international consternation, Trump was criticised in harsh terms by Winston Churchill’s grandson. Nicolas Burns, an American diplomat who served both Republican and Democratic presidents, called that choice “astonishing”.

The Le Monde report concerned events in Washington in early April this year, when the leaders of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia visited the White House for a meeting and a joint press conference. At the press conference, Trump praised his visitors and their countries for being good members of Nato and for not producing “fake news”.


But Le Monde perhaps risked provoking a presidential tweet on the latter subject when it reported that at the private meeting, “Trump opened by attributing to [the Baltic leaders] the responsibility for the war in Yugoslavia”.

Dalia Grybauskaitė of Lithuania, Kersti Kaljulaid of Estonia and Raimonds Vējonis of Latvia, the paper said, took “a moment to realise that ‘Baltics’ and ‘Balkan’ were getting mixed up in the mind of the American president”.


Trump, Le Monde said, remained “apparently uneducated in the matter by his wife, Melania, originally from the former Yugoslavia”.


Melania Trump is from Slovenia, which gained its independence in 1991, at the start of the bloody Balkan conflicts which only ended with the Kosovo war of 1998-99.

The White House did not immediately comment on the Le Monde report.

At the Elysée Palace, Trump and Macron made nice for the cameras, despite a Trump tweet on Friday in which he said his opposite number’s remarks about Europe’s need for military security against the US, China and Russia were “very insulting”.

Trump told reporters: “We’re getting along from the standpoint of fairness.”

Despite the cancellation of the visit to Belleau, where nearly 2,000 US Marines died in a ferocious battle in June 1918, Trump was scheduled to visit a different cemetery on Sunday, exactly 100 years since the end of the first world war.

A White House statement said the Belleau visit was “canceled due to scheduling and logistical difficulties caused by the weather”, and said a delegation “led by Chief of Staff Gen John Kelly and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Joe Dunford” would attend on behalf of the Trumps.

Nonetheless, Burns, the former ambassador, committed his thoughts to Twitter.

“Did the President really not visit the American military cemetery today in France?” he asked. “It is his duty to honor our soldiers who fought in 1917-18.”

Among veterans groups, one progressive organisation responded angrily.

“Donald Trump complained about having to stand in the rain, to speak about the massacre in Pittsburgh, because it messed his hair up (more),” said VoteVets in a tweet, referring to Trump’s remarks after a mass shooting two weeks ago in which 11 people were killed. “Today, he will skip honoring fallen American heroes of WWI, and stay in his hotel room, because of some rain.”",,/r/europe/comments/9vzpro/trump_mixed_up_balkans_and_baltics_claiming_that/e9glsns/,[deleted],1541905908

In 1789 French was only understood by less than half the country and spoken well by much less (estimated 12%). Only after the French revolution do you see:

* Freedom of the press causing a massive increase in publications. Most from Paris (in French!) but they were bought and shared all over the country.

* The Levée en masse (conscription) followed by an entire generation almost continuously at war in an army where overwhelmingly French was spoken. 

* The National Convention putting in law that French is to be the official language of the nation, and sending out their decrees to be read by the civil clergy all over France. They wanted to standardize language, just like they standardized measurements (the metric system). 

* Spoken French becoming a social indicator not of wealth/nobility but of patriotism and citizenry.

5059,"&gt;Yes. The extraordinary thing about Ulrike Guerrot's idea and by extension I guess the people who joined it today is that it skips the middle level of ""nation state"" since it claims everything can be solved better either more locally or more centralised. (At least that's how I got it, correct me if I'm wrong). Honestly, I'm torn on the idea because that's what makes it so utopian, but I can see the concept

Yeah, that is why I disagree with some of her ideas... I don't think we should centralize as much as she seems to would like. But in any case, it is great that she is doing this and getting these ideas out into the world and the citizens, which is the important thing right now. 

&gt;everyone should be able to see that bar the conservative nationalists (of whom we have quite a lot on r/europe)

To be honest, /r/europe (or European subs in general) is weird to me because of how polarized it is. There are a lot more Euro-federalists than in the average population, but nationalists also seem quite prevalent. 

And to be fair to them, they often oppose sovereignty transfers rather than democratic reforms, which they generally support. What they fail to see, in my view, is that you ultimately need to transfer sovereignty and take power away from the nations in order to have more European democracy. You can't have more citizen power while keeping the nations in command.

This issue is actually quite a hot topic in Turkey, left-wing Turks hate hijabs to the point of wanting to ban them again and complain about the influx of refugees and Middle Eastern tourists flooding Turkey to the point where every damn shopping mall or a touristy place is full of Arabs covered from head to toe, while right-wing Turks often wear hijabs and complain about how Turkey is less tolerant of hijabs despite being a Muslim-majority country than some predominantly Christian nations.

5080,"&gt;to killing, murdering and ethnic cleanesing 

There was ethnic cleansing in 1948 when every surrounding arab country went to war with Israel and vowed to push the jews into the sea. I don’t like it but it happens and war.   And seeing as how subsequently every surrounding Middle Eastern country kicked out all their Jews when they were not at war, I can’t help but see a person only complaining about one side being motivated by anti-Semitism.


Kind of like the anti-Semitism required to justify treating jews bad in Europe because of what the state of Israel is doing.


Also I recommend you look up the UNHDI for Palestinians and the population of Israeli Arabs and Palestinians.   


I don’t like Bibi, I don’t like the new law they passed saying only Jews have the right to self-determination in Israel.  But given that Infant mortality, life expectancy literacy, population size (of palestenains and Israeli Arabs) have all grown  I can’t help but find comparisons to Nazi Germany to be based on lies or ignorance.  Especially given that Muslims in Israel are treated far better than Jews in the surrounding countries are.

5156,"&gt;America's number are artificial and maintained with lowered tax and insane deficit, nothing impressive at all. The day you will have a budget surplus and a solid growth at the same time (Clinton partially succeeded in the 90s), then I'll be impressed!

&amp;#x200B;

This is a misconception. Lower taxes don't inflate GDP numbers. When you pay taxes more in taxes then the government turns around and just spends that money on something else than you would have spent it on. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are you calling insane? US deficit is forecast to be 4.2% of GDP this year. France's is 2.%. The US doesn't have a $20,000 higher GDP per capita than France because it runs a 2% to GDP higher deficit.

&amp;#x200B;

Are you German? Only a German could religiously think that solid growth and budget surpluses are somehow inextricable linked and that debt is evil, lol. That's not how economics works. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Gosh, you can raise taxes afterwards, but the amount of debt will be  there no matter what after years of laissez-faire and inaction.

Then we can print money. Who cares? We could use some more inflation.

&gt;France has been unstable until the 1870s, after that, the republic took  hold firmly, the 5 different republican regimes don't really count,  since the democracy wasn't threatened (I don't count the Vichy part,  since it was of course driven by the German invasion).

And yet, France was still invaded. That wasn't France's fault, but still was instability. How many French people lost all their stocks and savings during the invasion? How many French governments collapsed due to foreign invasion? That's not stability. 

&amp;#x200B;

And if you're going by pure political stability, then yeah, those 5 republics count. We're still on our first republic. I'd call that pretty politically stable. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Most European stock exchanges or bourses are older than that. What happened to US stocks in 1929?

It went down, then went back up. Same thing happened in 2007. That's why I invest for the long term. How many European bourses were completely wiped out during World War II?

5170,"Having one homosexual experience doesn't make one bi. Having a life style where you date both women and men is what makes someone bi.
This is why I actually like the french study a lot because they said something along the lines: ""Identities are meaningless"". By that he meant that one can identify as pretty much anything he wanted, but if he doesn't actually have the lifestyle of that identity, he really isn't part of that group. Say one person identifies as bi, but only had had one homosexual experience and it was a long time ago, this person certainly isn't bi, he just decides he wants to be part of it, but his actions do not follow the pre requisite to actually be called bi.

Your first link is pretty garbage, surveyed online and the age group is crap (40-70).
Second one is also an online survey...
And calling the Kinsey Scale accurate is pretty laughable.

How are you going to purport to speak for the people when you don’t represent them? You can’t be united without a leader.

More accurately, Kinsley Scale Tests find ~6-7% of the populace have had at least one homosexual experience and 3.5% have had a homosexual partner. This strongly indicates your surveys ""don't know"" are actually ""experimental"" (probably bi) people who are unsure of their sexuality.

5293,"They do. Multinationals located in Ireland pay 12.5% corporation tax on their *Irish* activities, while using Ireland as a base to sell to the entire EU. Sales outside the state are considered tax-due to the country where the company is headquartered, and with multinationals that's often the United States. No tax evasion scheme involving Ireland exists without terminating the funds in an *actual* tax haven such as the British crown dependencies and overseas territories (Bermuda, Caymans, etc). The reason why Ireland is caught up in this tax haven business is because of the aforementioned rule about revenues being taxable to the country where the company is headquartered, rather than where the revenues are booked. It *was* a flaw in the way the Irish tax system interacted with other jurisdictions tax rules, because it meant that companies could dodge tax by routing through a company headquartered in those real tax havens. But these sorts of evasion schemes (the double Irish sandwich) were ended in 2014 by the Irish government and In 2015 put into place a new law that forced companies which are newly incorporated in Ireland to also be a tax resident here. It will take effect in 2020 for companies with existing operations in Ireland to align Ireland's corporate tax regime with international  practices. Ireland remains one of the only countries in the world to make targeted changes to the law to actually *prevent* multinational tax evasion.

&gt;I'm not oblivious. It's just that the US doesn't do a lot of trade as a percentage of our economy like Europe does. It's not as big of deal for our economy. Plus, the current ""trade war"" is a pretty minor dispute compared to the actual trade we do.

It's a smaller deal perhaps for you, but not a big deal at all is a bit far stretched.

&gt;Nah, I don't believe it's an advantage. I think it's a disadvantage for use cause it pushes up the value of our currency which hurts our trade balance.

You can't say it has only disadvantages though.

&gt;Idk. Good point.

[There are apparently a lot of variations depending on where you find the information, for example IMF reported 2.7% GDP growth in 2017 for the EU, 2.5% for the Eurozone, and 2.4% for the whole European continent. And 2.2% for the US.](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/EU/EURO/EUQ)So generally speaking we can agree on the fact last year was a good year for both Europe and North America, the most important economic parts of the world, that's all what matters isn't it? Let's hope it will be also good for all of us for the upcoming years.  


&gt;Eh.... they sort of kinda did? I think Ireland and Spain did. Italy's banks are in shambles and the UK's program didn't work very well. Again, like the US program was structured way differently and far from increasing our public debt the US made a profit of the TARP program when the US government sold off its shares in American banks it had taken once they had recovered. It was a win win for us.

I heard it was a win for some European banks as well. For example, French and German banks are better than ever after having been massively capitalized by their governments in the expense of the taxpayers, but also with very good terms when they had to bail out their funds after the Greek crisis, the Greek state paid them well they made lot of profits, here at the expense of the Greek people. If this also happened in the US (I heard many American people sadly lost their homes that way), there is nothing to be proud of. I would rather see those banks, the same that are greatly responsible of the last crisis, be shut down, than jeopardize people lives and have them pay for their excesses. And I really worry this could start again in the next years, nothing has been learnt from our previous mistakes.  


&gt;Where are those data from? That's completely different from when I googled ""Eurozone Labor Force participation rate"". Germany alone has a participation rate of 60%. Your second article is behind a paywall.

This chart is taken from an article of the Financial Times (the link I sent you under paywall) and data from Oxford Economics/Haver Analytics, I suppose (but that needs to be confirmed) that the previous data you saw with 58.5% of activity rate is the one for the whole EU while this one is for the Eurozone which is close to 73%, still I'm surprised like you of the very diverging data.I've found also different activity rates, data taken from OECD (people from 15 to 64 years old):

* [US activity rate: 72.9% (2016)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRAC64TTUSA156S)
* [Germany activity rate: 78.3% (2018 Q3)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRAC64TTDEQ156N)
* [France activity rate: 71.4% (2016)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRAC64TTFRA156N)

&gt;Is poverty rising in America? The US median household income is well above that of Europe.

[Poverty has decreased for the last 4 years but hasn't actually recovered its lower rate from pre crisis period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Screenshot-www.census.gov-2018.09.15-10-25-15.png).  


&gt;Yeah you wouldn't want to live in Mississippi. I'm from there. But Mississippi has only 3 million people. The South is the fastest economically growing part of the country right now and has been for several years.  
&gt;  
&gt;Don't talk bs like quality of life. Things are CHEAP in the US. Houses are BIGGER in the US. Everyone owns cars. Taxes are lower. Wages are higher. When Europeans talk about quality of life all they really do is pat themselves on the back for having fancy old cathedrals to look at.

I'll be honest with you I never went to Mississippi nor the south, but I did go to the US (New Jersey and New York states). Perhaps I'm wrong but my image of your state are basically from what I see on TV, or from people I know who went there, so I have no personal experience at all. Anyway I went to the US and some parts of Canada which have similar ""way of life"" with those huge houses you mentioned, cheap accomodation, big cars, etc. That's nice, but it's not what would make me want to live there, there was ""something"" missing that would have make me wanted to live there (I was thinking about going to Canada actually to finish my master degree), Idk if it's due to the different culture, mentality or different way of life, but I don't see myself living anywhere else than in Europe for now.

&gt;And what was France's average growth from 2008-present? Yeah, it didn't fall as hard. But then it had very low growth for almost a decade.

Very low is a bit too much, [France definitely did better than some nations, it's actually in the middle pack of the developed nations](https://fullfact.org/media/uploads/Recession_and_recovery.png), average growth from 2008-present was not that different from example from the UK (from base 100 in 2008, UK is now at 110 in 2018 and 109 for France).  


&gt;Of course it has higher growth ***lately***. It's easy to have high growth once you just went through a Great Depression and gutted your economy. Spain had 20% unemployment for years and years. It's still at **15.2%** unemployment 10 years after the 2008 crisis. That's absurd.

That's not absurd, it's going to be 4 years Spain experiences a growth above 3%, few developed countries have that chance.

5400,"Before Europe had a certain degree of unconditional trust in the US. Call it giving the benefit of the doubt. Or that that the US even if when acting in its own interests wasn't unnecessariy damaging European interests. (And it was honestly not justified at that point already. Washington post wrote already sometime in the Eighties that Europe has 0 reason to 'trust' the US)

Also while this study has been published recently (JULY 9, 2018) the data it is based on isn't that up to date: It is from Spring 2017. With Trumps inauguration being on January 20, 2017. So these numbers most likely don't represent the influence Trump has had to any relevant degree (Spring is very vague, could be Jan-March or Feb-April. But no matter how you align it Trump wasn't able to do all the damage he did until now)

http://www.pewglobal.org/2018/10/01/2-faith-in-the-u-s-president-remains-low/

This one is about 'trust in Trump' and the data is from Spring 2018, so one year later. The numbers - albeit they cannot be taken as an answer to 'If the first question was asked one year later' or even to the 'trust in US' (since this one is about Trump himself) - don't paint an encouraging picture of the development of trust the world still has. Among the European countries Trump is most trusted in Poland which currently has a rightwing government...

Next two articles only state German survey numbers. Mostly because I can only with confidence state the general mood of the country I am in. 

https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article161766668/Deutsche-verlieren-wegen-Trump-Vertrauen-in-die-USA.html

(German article). This one is from Feburary 2017 (so around the date of the survey you linked. It has a 22 (can): 70 (can't) answer to ""can the US be called a trusted partner of Germany?"" Which is a -37 point shift after Trumnps inauguration. The numbers are barely better then Russias. And that was when Trump was President for a month. Not close to 2 years.

https://www.br.de/nachricht/inhalt/deutsche-vertrauen-russland-mehr-als-den-usa-100.html

Also German. From Mai 2018. positive answers to ""can trust the US"" are at 25%. -3% compared to previous survey (doesn't state when that was).

Bonus to take into account (all happened after last survey I just looked up). These are primarily actions of Trump, which will tank his ""rating"" among not-right wing Germans way further. Same should apply to pretty much all Europeans that are similarly not rightwing:

In June 2018 Trump called Canada a 'national security threat' (Yes, I am aware that that's primary bc. of his trade war bullshit)

In July 2018 Trump called ""Russia a friend and journalists the enemy""

In August 2018 Trump called the EU 'a foe'. Just like he called China and Russia a 'foe' in the very same example. (Yes, I am aware he called it ""that's nothing bad"" and ""in trade"". Doesn't matter, he put the EU in the same box as China and Russia)

€ How could I miss this one: In August 2018 when asked about Article 5 + if Montenegro, a NATO member, would invoke it Trump basically said he doesn't know why he should care (Yes, he back paddled really fast publicly. But nobody in their right might would believe Trump had changed his original view. That was just that bad of a a fuckup that even he had to try appease people)

In October 2018 Trump stood by SA basically covering them after murdering a journalist.


***

Let's see if anyone actually will write an answer to why you would downvote me or if you are just the usual troll ignoring rediquette. Anything else beside above that I should have done to reinforce my point of

&gt;The relevant point is that (since Trump) the trust in the US as reliable ally is practically gone.

? Except of course accepting a survey from a point in time where the damage Trump would do wasn't even remotly clear. I even used a survey from the same fucking source as the one that was meant to 'disprove' me.

The way that like, France built a carrier, they just built one like half-sized carrier that only like hangs out in the Mediterranean. There's no point in building just one aircraft carrier. If you need an airstrike on the other side of the world then that ship needs to sail all the way around the world. That's why France originally planned on building 2 carriers until budget cuts scrapped the second one. With only one carrier it's almost like they built a cool toy just to say they built a cool toy to use as their flagship. 

&amp;#x200B;

The UK built it's aircraft carriers because the UK's carrier can easily operate just with the US carriers fleets. That makes more sense since it's almost just a additional carrier group to both US and UK naval forces which would  expect to work together. And the UK is building a second carrier so that if one is in maintenance, the other can be available.

Germany's planned progress will put it on track to reach the 2024 goal by 2041.

Italy have actually managed to make negative progress, cutting spending from 1.47% to 1.15%, with further cuts planned next year (hilariously, they are still claiming that they plan to meet the 2% target by 2024)

The Netherlands plan to make it to 1.3% by 2028 (which puts them on track to reach 2% by some time in the early 22nd century)

Spain are claiming they'll hit 1.53% by 2024, but even that should be taken with a pinch of salt given that their progress so far has been to cut spending from 1.25% to 0.87%.

Belgium has cut spending since 2014 and is now at 0.90%, with no indication I can find that they intend to make any effort to approach the target.

Norway has announced its intention to cut spending to 1.5% of GDP and keep it there until 2024

NAR is responsible, among other things, for a bomb attack in Bologna in 1980 which killed 85 and injured 200 people. Following the NAR trial Fiore was sentenced to five years in prison, however he did not serve it, as he fled to the UK and avoided extradition back to Italy.

Neo-Classicism is an architectural language, which uses specific signs in elements to convey its message. In that respect yes, construction plays a role, especially in tectonics, but the ornamental language of the style is the primary actor of its definition (columns exist also in Baroque, Gothic and Functionalism, but Neoclassical columns have specific aesthetic proportions and ornamentation that sets them apart from the other). And ornament is by definition not structural.

5549,"&gt;no I was looking for ""leading"", indeed majority here was misplaced and I meant it for the 2nd round which is the one that matters, with 66% of votes.

Sure, but plurality is the word you say for the person who got the most votes without getting a majority. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This world is interconnected, saying there is no consequence on what people outside the US think of him is pure idiocy.

&amp;#x200B;

What is someone going to declare war on us? Lots of people in the world don't like the US. I'm used to it. No sense in losing sleep over it. I can only vote against him once. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And in a way, it allows the Eurozone members to have saner budgets with  these constraints, the US can (for now) do whatever it wants printing as  much dollar as it wants because dollar is the leading currency, as long  as people trust the dollar it will remain that way, the thing is with  endangering your finance, it could also impact the trust internationally  people have on the dollar and they could potentially shift to other  currencies, that's already the case anyway. And one trillion deficit is  economic suicide, remember that the budget deficit projected is counted  with the high growth the US will experience! That basically means that  if next years are less favourable (which will eventually be the case)  that deficit will skyrocket.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, let them shift to other currencies. If anything, being the leading currency hurts the US economy because it causes excess appreciation in the dollar due to the extra international demands for greenbacks which pushes up the US exchange rate and hurts our trade balance. A weaker dollar would definitely help us out. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;[A more recent article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/eurozone-economy-growth-2017-fastest-gdp-eu-currency-financial-crisis-a8184806.html) another one [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43055887), Eurozone annual GDP growth in 2017 was 2.5%, so higher than the US, and all that with saner public finance.

 

 I will take your more recent article and I will raise you an even more recent article. Eurozone GDP growth for 2017 was later revised down to 2.3%, so not higher than the US. 

[https://www.ft.com/content/5d111fa0-21ee-11e8-add1-0e8958b189ea](https://www.ft.com/content/5d111fa0-21ee-11e8-add1-0e8958b189ea)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It has always been higher since the end of the 19th century. But the gap  is narrowing. The simple explanation as to why the Eurozone didn't grow  as fast this year is because they didn't artificially increased the  growth with widening deficits, that's just another philosophy.

But it's not narrowing, it's widening. Like I said, US reached its pre-crisis GDP back in 2011 while the EU did in 2016. If anything, it ought to be narrowing pretty fast if all things were the same since you are already poorer per capita, but it's not. 

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Depends on the countries, but anyway, the crisis started in the US for  some reason, and I wouldn't be surprised another one would start by 2020  also in the US (mainly due to how your public finance is handled and  skyrocketing debts particularly the private ones like student loans).  But this time I hope for the world we wouldn't have to suffer as much  from your mismanagements, I know Europe already is putting some efforts  to rely less on the US and consequently be less impacted by potential US  downturns.

It did start in the US. But the US recovered quickly because we recapitalized our banking system immediately (the taxpayer actually made a profit off of that) and we lowered interest rates. Europe did otherwise and is still suffering from the fact that Europe never recapitalized its banks. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;6.8 which is quite low already.  
&gt;  
&gt;My turn for questions, what is the US economic activity rate? I will help you answering it: [it's actually lower to the EU one.](https://tradingeconomics.com/european-union/labor-force-participation-rate)

1. Ok, the Eurozone unemployment rate is actually 8.2%.  [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/9105310/3-31082018-AP-EN.pdf/772f2449-74be-415d-b4b0-351f3198272](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/9105310/3-31082018-AP-EN.pdf/772f2449-74be-415d-b4b0-351f31982720). It's 3.7% in the US. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Your own data shows that the EU has a lower labor force participation rate. 58.1% compared to 62.9% in the US. So wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, you are poorer per capita than the US. You ***should*** be growing much more rapidly than the US. Europe is falling even further behind. I don't think you realize how slowly Europe has been growing lately compared to just the rest of the developed world. 

&amp;#x200B;

You have countries like Italy that have barely grown in 20 years. France is stagnant. Brexitshambles. Spain and Greece were... Spain and Greece. Eurozone debt crisis. Much bigger problems than we got

&gt; The second key discovery in the 1990s was the emergence of a negative correlation between population growth and economic growth in further analyses of international cross-sectional data ([xi], [xii]). In 2001, Birdsall and Sinding summarised the new position, stating that “in contrast to assessments over the last several decades, rapid population growth is found to have exercised a quantitatively important negative impact on the pace of aggregate economic growth in developing countries” ([xiii]). A recent meta-analysis of this research concluded that a negative relationship emerged in the post-1980 data, and that its strength has increased with time 

Basically some research finds no relationship between population growth and economic growth whilst some finds a negative; there is no research which finds a positive relationship.

5629,"&gt; Okay and keeping African migrants out does not require us paying off African governments?

While money is certainly involved, just paying them off will not be enough in the long-run. It's the ideal scenario of course, even if its several states and not only one government as with Turkey. At some point however, one of the states may fail and we will have to ensure that a state we *can* pay off is established. 

&gt;This could potentionally change in the future, if there is some EU federal country with united foreign policy and a common army, but that's something that just has no chance of happening in the foreseeable future. So we will definitely not sacrifice our ties with the US because at some point in the future, there could possibly be some EU army that might be able to protect all member countries.

I agree you shouldn't cut ties with the US, I don't even agree a federal EU should cut ties with the US. I merely pointed out that the potential for an interdependent relationship exists with France, but ofc. depends on France accepting an honest deal in return. 

If France is truly out to push their own interests above all else as stated in the article you linked, then their efforts will not be successful even in the medium term. I'm still holding my breath here, because the German military has some issues of its own that may lead them to be overly critical on principle. 

&gt;Well looking precisely at EI2, I would say the answer it - not a single part. They did not even attempt to institutionalize this initiative into the EU structures. Instead, it's basically an informal inter-governmental initiative where France evidently wants to play the lead role.

Which can be explained in this case by pointing out that they wanted Britain to play a rôle as well. Personally, I am interested to see what happens with the crisis response core and other projects under PESCO. If they suffer because France wants its own intervention force, then I'm afraid you are correct. 

Something I find critical about French involvement right now for example is that they do not participate in the military mobility project, which should really be a no-brainer for any NATO member.",EU nation: /r/acteuropa,/r/europe/comments/9vs6js/тrump_insulted_by_macrons_proposal_for_european/e9ezrok/,DFractalH,1541853342

&gt;How do you interpret this?

It's not ""Death to Jews"", even if it's of course bad.

&gt;Who cares who wrote the article? The facts are facts, that's all that matters.

What facts? It was ""allegedly"" shouted as another paper explains. Or did you find that on the video?

Sure, there was at least one disgusting Holocaust denier there, who was  anti-Semitic, but that's not the same as directly calling for the death of someone.

The source matters. The title speaks about multiple ""men"" doing that and people here think there is some ultra-radical mob that chants ""death to Israel"" (quoting you here), but the activist who filmed it only mentions one man.

5709,"&gt; But first we'll see a smaller amount of people paying for an increasingly longer group, while we all demand more also. Not going to be pretty in a few decades I think.

No, quite the opposite. If natality goes down now the cost first goes down because the working middle-age doesn't have to pay for those chidlren any more. Remember that how it works is that the middle-age pays for both the seniors and the minors so increased natality also means first higher cost for minors. So that cost is cut first and when those minors reach middle age there wil be less of them to pay for the seniors but if natality continues to go down they also have to pay less for their minors so that's for granted.

&gt; When you have a decreasing population, this will indeed also impact economies, because you can't have your revenue grow endlessly.

Absolute revenue no, but remember that revenu has to be divided by population size to measure individual benefits and since population size shrinks it's okay for absolute total revenue to also shrink.

That's not a metaphor but an approximation.

&gt; The problem with a joint-EU army is that it only makes sense if you do it to replace the national armies. If you created a joint EU army while keeping the national armies then you would just be duplicating military spending and actually losing military capability across Europe as a whole 

Not necessarily, you can have national forces and also a pan EU army, and it's not like European states waste that much money in the military comparatively to our dear American partners.

 

&gt;What? The EU has lots of stupid shit that they put a fancy name on. That doesn't mean it does anything.

Clearly way less stupid shit than the US army and unnecessary meddling in so many fronts these last decades, we see the results now in Afghanistan and in Iraq.

That's where they make money, not peopke in rural Ireland going to Spain once a year. We really have a gold mine here but aren't handling it too well. Right now the airport is barely handling all the long haul flights we have, because it's just too small and terminal 2 was built in a way that it can't be extended. They are having serious problems with delays because of this. They have so many plans for expansion but no room for the aircraft.

Shannon was kept alive years ago because the government had this ridiculous policy of making all transatlantic flight between Dublin and the US stop at Shannon before carrying on to their destination.
