3,"It is modern to use a Hussite Wars, but I would still use the original term, Hussite Revolution, because it was a revolution that sought to change the existing order, and the process went through the definition outlined in the 30s in the book, The anatomy of revolution by Crane Brinton. The revolution was caused among many other issues by a power struggle between the king, Vaclav IV and the church that was undermining the royal authority. This caused the pillar of the medieval society to collapse. The Hussite Wars were accompanying symptom of the revolution, deepened by foreign interventions. Hussite for a while sought out to reconcile with Rome and the Emperor without success. The Hussite Wars ended in 1434-37, from which Hussites emerged as victorious and the Catholic church administration disintegrated in Bohemia and much of Moravia. The struggle between various Hussite parties and Catholics continued for several decades, until the leadership came to the conclusion that religion cannot be forced. This led to a declaration of the religious freedom in Bohemia under the Treaty of Kutna Hora in 1485 for the next 31 years, and in 1512-16 confirmed as an eternal. Between 1485 and 1618, Bohemia experienced the longest period of peace and stability, where there were not foreign troops on its territory. Bohemia and Moravia became prosperous until the 30 Years War that in the name of the religion destroyed the country economically, socially, and culturally and Czechs did not recover from it for the next 100 years. Czechs never accepted the Catholic church as its own, and the Counter-Reformation was just a patina that created among the Catholics as a success over the heretics.",,/r/europe/comments/a17tky/percentage_of_europeans_who_believe_in_god/earlw57/,kaik1914,1543551948

A fetus becomes a person in my view, when it develops a functional brain. A killer, whether you like it or not is a fully formed person. As I already explained the position of ""right to life"" is not my own, nor is it one I adhere to. My argument against the death penalty has nothing to do with ""rights"", but rather the following:

- In any system where the death penalty is used you will always execute an X number of innocents per Y number of guilty. That in itself is a deal breaker.

- A civilised legal system has many inherent motivations behind it - deterrence, protection of the public, rehabilitation, social stability.

50,"&gt; No it's not. Tell me how long it would take UK, France and other to mobilize, organize forces, send them to Germany? Now how long it would take for already mobilized and equipped hundreds of thousands of Russian soldier in Kaliningrad to get through Poland? Of course Germany would get help from other NATO member but at that point they would probably already fight on German grounds.

Do you think this is some weird WW2 era bullshit? You realize that every western nation has satellites and intel reports coming in by the hour, right?

If Russia mobilized 100k men, tanks, vehicles, planes, etc, then the EU would know loooong before they ever touched Ukraine soil.

Or do you think that NATO members didn't know that those ""Russian rebels"" weren't actually soldiers?

&gt;Really? UK is decreasing army spending just like France. Now they have less than 80k active (2015 data says 80k, but they decreased this number, just like in previous years, for example in 2010 it was 113k) and 300 active tanks. France actually have smaller active army than Ukraine. 110k active land forces, 100 more tanks than UK. Meanwhile Russia have 400k active land forces personnel, 2.5k active tanks (10 times more in reserves).

Again ... this is not WW2.

10 British navy soldiers have far more capability and strategic options than 100 Russians.

You don't need a huge army to win a war, not when you have precision guided missiles, massive bombers, stealth planes, and EMPs.

&gt;In a long run Germany, France, UK and other European countries could outproduce Russians, gain upper hand, but you need to be able to defend long enough for that. But it's not 1914 anymore, even WW2 showed that having stronger economy won't mean anything if you don't fight long enough for it to be a important factor.

The EU is outspending Russia on military 4 fold. I have no clue what you're on about mate.

It has also gained significant economic leverage over Armenia, it even makes Armenia pay for a Russian military base there.

132,"&gt; Cocaine is a lot more addictive than alcohol

The thing with statements like that is that there's no ""objective scale"" for addiction and there's often several factors leading to the abuse, with variations in all of that depending on the individual and their particular neurochemistry.

With stuff like cocaine and crystal meth, the main addicting part is the performance enhancement that people experience. Once they lick blood from that, it's easy to fall into a spiral where they keep ""reupping"" to keep up their performance, scared of not being able to ""keep up"" anymore without.

The same holds true for alcohol, while it might not be performance enhancing, it's a substance that many people abuse to cope with the stress of their lives. Leading to the situation that many people are actually high-functioning alcoholics, without anybody around them ever noticing, which also holds true for the above groups of cocaine/crystal (and even cannabis) users: The vast majority of these people exist without anybody ever noticing their habits because they are quite successful at self-medicating.

157,"&gt;Actually, maybe I did disregard adult lives. That was wrong

It is good that you have seen the error of your ways. However the principles for legal system you have outlined had been very clear. Rehabilitation is not a priority, by your own logic you are still due to be executed within your own system. 

&gt;However, do you love your child more or some random stranger? I bet your child. Same way I value all children more than adults.

No. You seem to display an unhealthy obsession with children. Given the topic at hand, I hope that your obsession does not cross over into the criminal. Would be a shame for you to have to convict yourself to the death penalty within your own legal system for even more crimes. 

&gt;As for the accused, I stand by my point. Since they are evil, it's okay to disregard their lives.

Accused is not the same as guilty, you have been made aware of that flaw in my very first comment. You once again have been executing innocent people in your mind.

Amoeba are life, a fungal colony is life, a jellyfish is life, a worm is life,  a rat is life, a human is life. Most legal systems place the developmental restriction for abortion to be somewhere between  that of a jellyfish and that of a worm. Although the DNA is human and if the process is uninterrupted the fetus will develop into a human being, in my view at that stage it had not yet gained any of the morphological characteristics that make a person and as such does not present major moral barriers for termination. At that stage is no more than a minor medical procedure. 

Once we get into the later stages of development - primarily formation of the brain - that is when, in my view, there is plausible deniability when it comes to morality of abortion. Making the procedure either justified state sanctioned killing or murder depending on the situation.

234,"Is it really necessary to tax Stroh 80 more than Vodka, though? Per ml ethanol, that is, not per bottle.

Alcoholics who did their maths already figured out that wine is the most cost-effective way to get their fix, anyway, and non-alcoholics won't stay with straight Stroh 80 for any time as long as literally anything else is available (wine has comparatively low ethanol tax plus no beer tax. It's a kind of subsidy of German wineyards so that they can survive against the onslaught of France. Yes that means buying tetra packs. Don't ask me how the sparkling wine tax fits into that, which was introduced to finance the Kaiser's fleet)

But yes, it really does make sense to tax high-percentage alcohol more than low-percentage, as lower percentages lower the chances to become alcoholic in the first place.

The less the US has to spend on European defense the more it can spend on countering China. If America's allies were all good faith security partners there wouldn't be an issue. You get Trump's bad cop routine because Obama and Bush's good cop routines failed to produce any result.

&gt;And the fact that he got pissy at Macron for saying Europe should build up it's own army supports that.

Macron has made it clear that a EU army could very well be in opposition to the US. 

NATO is like a potluck dinner which the US provides the majority of the food while Europe has provided a small minority despite being just as prosperous. Trump threatens to call it off if Europe doesn't actually contribute a fair share. So Macron goes and says okay we'll start cooking more but it will be our own potluck and your not part of it.

Next, yeah, international agreements can be violated, and it often happens. But let's examine why. 

When you sign a private lawful agreement, say, a contract with a USA-based employer, you can expect that the whole might of the powerful legal system of a world superpower will help you in case the employer breaches some of the contract provisions.

International agreements between great powers, on the other hand, cannot be enforced by some third party by definition, because the signatories of the agreement are themselves the most powerful entities on the planet. So it's not at all trivial question, how to enforce the agreement execution.

409,"To a degree. But there are other factors at play as well. Will 100 British MBTs beat 20.000 Russian ones? Certainly not.

But do they need to? How much tanks do you need if you have planes and artillery that can do the same? And wipe out tanks on a whim. What use is a tank army today? Tanks are still needed, but are they still the be all end all of conventional combat? Many western armies haven't discarded of tanks. In fact, they have some of the best tanks ever built, but in small numbers. 

Because they don't really need them. Russia has found a good way to preserve its strength, but is it the same strength they still need to win a war? Iraq had once the 4th largest tank force in the world. Brought them roughly a week until the US was through with them. Russia is tougher, no doubt, but has the same issues.

It may seem like a short time, but even if the majority of Russian reserve tanks would be 20 years old (many are older) that's the time between WW1 and WW2. Massive changes between that. And with ever greater technological advancements, those gaps widened.

In my time in the German army, I was, amongst other units, stationed with the artillery. Our whole battaillion had 6 self-propelled artillery pieces. Not MBTs, but commonly counted among the tanks, since they even used a Leopard 2 chassis.

Together with satellite surveillance (my job), recon drones and general combat surveillance, those artillery guns had no trouble hitting a tank sized target 80km away. Those guns 6 guns and their attached equipment were more expensive than 30 old reserve tanks. But those 6 artillery guns would have wiped the floor with any 30 tanks, much more with some that were more than 2 decades old. That does not even mention planes, where technology really shines these days.

Again, Russia would be a very hard opponent. It wouldn't be a war like Iraq. But expecting the Russian army, numerically and technologically inferior, with less founding to roll up all of European NATO in a few weeks is delusional, tbh.

Even if we doubt the European armies ability to win right now, they don't have to. They would just have to delay Russia for a few months and the economic might of Europe would crush them in the long run.

422,"&gt; So i hope it explains why EU will have to expand, if it wants to keep it economy going.

What you are describing is globalization. But free trade, economic cooperation and market access don't have to go hand in hand with political integration, which comes with a lot more than just mutually beneficial trade. In the EUs case, a mutual defense clause, which would have expanded the EU's sphere of interest to Russia's border. In the earlier case of Turkey's interest of associating with the EU, the reception was lukewarm to say the least (or rather non-existent), even though Turkey is a far more important market than Ukraine and was a historical part of ancient Europe. I don't think your argument holds any water here.

&gt; And there is no civil war in eastern Ukraine. There is Russian aggression as well. Confirmed by OSCE PA as well as PACE. Corresponding resolutions are available on the websites of both organizations. Talking about civil war is retranslating Russian propaganda, sorry.

Right, civil war might have been a misnomer, it's clear Russia is sending troops and material to the theater. But the fact remains that Ukraine is a country with ethnic and cultural divisions, and a large Russian minority lives in the East. The faultline of popular support for associating with the EU ran across these lines.

&gt; Which bite do you mean? EU menbership? Not sure i get it right. But never the less, it is EU who more needs Ukraine as Ukraine EU. Current association and Schengen is quite alright for Ukraine already.

Well, what's done is done. Ukraine got it's association, lost Crimea and gained a low-intensity conflict in the East. If Schengen is worth this, I have no objections.

&gt; The very best example of not interfering is Syria: all that mess could have been prevented way before, just by saying firmly ""NO"" to comrades Waldemar ans Asad. That would suffice.

It's a really strong move, and Russia has been playing the politics of it, and is probably using trump, and their propaganda machines, to try and secure the US as a political ally. 

That's why the danger is imminent, because while Trump is in power, there is a chance Russia and the US could be allies, in a great war. 

We don't know their plans. Maybe they are confident they can secure a second term, or maybe they are on the clock to try and undermine the democratic republic of the US to try and keep Trump in power, and a declaration of war might very well be a part of that plan. 

The next 2 to 6 years will be very dangerous with a high risk of disaster. Which for some reason, the american public was for the most part completely unaware at the last election.

- Four years later economy finally started to grow somewhat, and currently Russia is a bit ahead of Greece in terms of per capita GDP (in PPP), as per CIA info

Of course automated filters will play a huge roll in most consequences of art. 13 of the new proposal, but not as much in enforcing the existing exceptions and limitation from the 2001 directive. Automated filters are useful to identify non-original content. In the legal letter of the text (where this topic is about) it doesn't matter that they can't identify original work. 

&gt; but those will be the ones making that judgment call if Article 13 passes.

No. Just read the directive (or wait 2 months if you don't want to base an opinion on the current draft/negotiations), it doesn't demand an automated system to make that decision. First of all (literally, it's point 1 of art. 13) it will be based on license agreements; next to that, using automated technology is based on the availability of ""suitable and effective technologies"". So obviously it's not a legal requirement to use unavailable and/or unsuitable technologies. And it will probably good enough to hire a trainee in a legal department for a week to substantiate that there is no technology available to make the decision you proposed.

So from a legal point of view, there's already one proposal from a CSSP about how to handle that, and no, it's not something that uploaders will like.

521,"&gt; Portugal’s example, lauded by Brussels, is in sharp contrast to Italy’s plan to widen the budget deficit, condemned by the European Commission and a cause of investor unease. 

More like, EPP Juncker and his EPP Commission were very much against it until they couldn't do shit about it any more because they couldn't leverage the indices that treaties let them use to bend countries' policies. Lauded, no, forced to accept, yes.

[Reminder](https://www.latribune.fr/economie/union-europeenne/le-bras-de-fer-entre-bruxelles-et-le-portugal-commence-548005.html) translated automatically with DeepL : *« The battle between Lisbon and Brussels is starting. The 2016 budget proposed by the new Portuguese socialist government has been given a very cold welcome by the European Commission. On Monday, February 1, Annika Breidthardt, spokesperson for the EU executive, reported ""major differences"" between the two sides. Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the Commission, said he was ""very concerned. ""On Tuesday 2 February, Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said that ""the progress of the discussions was insufficient to ensure that the Portuguese draft budget was in line with the Stability and Growth Pact. ""Brussels has thus rejected proposals for correction by the Portuguese government. Discussions will continue until Friday.*

[...]

*The issue at stake in this budgetary procedure is [...] very much a political one. [...] The new Portuguese coalition has been a challenge to the troika policy pursued since 2010 and on which, unlike many other institutions such as the IMF, the Commission has never made a mea culpa. It also poses a political problem at European level: it breaks the traditional alliance between social democrats and conservatives that has been the political vehicle for the austerity and policy desired by Brussels, and which is also the alliance that reigns in the European Parliament and from which the Commission emerged. In this respect, it sets a dangerous precedent that is beginning to openly inspire the Spanish Socialists, despite their reputation as very reformist. Breaking this alliance can therefore be considered as a political priority by the Commission, which has been defined by Jean-Claude Juncker, its President, as early as 2014, as a ""Political Commission"". »*

Fortunately, Portugal won. Unfortunately, that was not enough to question austerity in the EU at large. Fortunately, the success of QE went to the rescue. Unfortunately, it's still not done and will definitely not be if the EPP wins again in 2019.",,/r/europe/comments/a1hpn3/portugals_parliament_passes_2019_budget_deficit/eaqd8a9/,_Handsome_Jack,1543516020

546,"&gt; By modern standards Greece wasn't democratic.

sure but we generally view Greek democracy as an inspiration/origin to ours. even though a system like that today would be viewed even more negatively than Russia

&gt; While all citizens could vote, citizens were already an elite class, making it much more of an oligarchy than anything.

yeah but the whole point of the democracy was that the regular citizens had this right too and not just the aristocracy

&gt; Besides, without independent media you can't reliably follow what's happening politically, which in turn means the elections can't be truly free and fair, as you are intentionally given misinformation while all else is suppressed. 

even if we assume that this is true (in the age of the internet it's not really true), why does that matter? i still think the core concept of democracy is that the people choose. this does in no way guarantees that they make a good choice - many people still choose to not follow politics and vote against their own interests, even in places where they could reasonably do so

&gt; If the government interferes in the process, that subverts democracy.

There is no logical explanation for the Dutch lying about this as IRBMs are huge liability for them. It would be great if Russia wasn't doing it, but they are.

France and the UK were allied before June '40, and not out of the goodness of the UK's heart, but because having allies is good and not having to fight on British soil was very much to their advantage. The liberation of Europe was not because De Gaulle asked pretty please, but because it was in no one's interest to have a powerful, aggressive dictatorship occupying most of Europe.

De Gaulle distrust of the British and the Americans had more to do to with their attempt to marginalise the not-insignificant French contigent abroad, and occupy France, same as Germany. I'll be the first to grant he was quite the cunt during the liberation, but he had a very weak hand and the alternative was not so nice for a patriot, which one cannot deny he was.

781,"From the text you just quoted:

&gt; The concept of a unified white race did not achieve universal acceptance in Europe when it first came into use in the 17th century, or in the centuries afterward.

which itself states ""the concept of a unified white race ... first came into use in the 17th century"". It just states that it took time to be ""universally accepted"".

The rest of your quote goes on about how some of the strongest proponents of racialism sought to portray other European peoples as non-whites (and even among the Nazis this was not very successful - for example, the fear among some of the Nazi leadership that their occupation plans in Russia 'would weaken the white race in favour of the numerically superior Asians'[0]). Nevertheless, this is tangential to our argument, which - if you recall - is about the source of the term 'white person' and its meaning to the European empires which introduced it.

&gt; also your quote just states that white meant Spaniard, no where does it say that white meant European

It specified the requirements to be considered legally white, which was everyone except those of ""African, Native American, Jewish, or morisco ancestry"" - note that there were asians in Spanish colonies, but there would certainly have been other Europeans.

&gt; Also your wiki article, some more examples of the superior WASP race

And? I'm not denying the Anglo-Americans use of the word. In fact, I've been arguing the opposite - that to other European empires with colonies with large numbers of non-Europeans, it generally meant other Europeans.

&gt; There is no mention of the French what so ever

Yes, since en.wikipedia is Anglo-centric. Look at the French Wikipedia if you want French history, e.g.:

&gt; L'Arrêt du Conseil d’État du 5 avril **1778** interdit les mariages interraciaux entre **blancs** et noirs ou gens de couleur en France

i.e. a concept of a white race was substantial enough even in 1778 to pass laws about it.

&gt;  
&gt;Agreement between Ukraine and the Russian Federation on cooperation in the use of the Azov Sea and the Kerch Strait;

&gt;Part 1 of Article 36 of the UN Convention, which states that all straightaway vessels referred to in Article 37 of the UN Convention shall enjoy the right of transit passage to which no interference shall occur.  
&gt;  
&gt;Articles 32, 95 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea under which warships enjoy immunity.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Russian Federation has issued a Coast Guard warning (SEP) for closing the Kerch Strait entry area at the official web site (Cadiz, Spain) at 11.40 on 25 November 2018, that is, after the arrival of warships from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in the Kerch Strait.  
&gt;  
&gt;Article 30 of the UN Convention, according to which a coastal country has the right to demand the immediate abandonment of territorial waters by a military ship of another state, but in no case shall not use weapons for the suffering without any reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;Article 2 of the UN Charter, according to which disputes must be resolved peacefully, in order not to endanger international peace and security and justice, as well as the requirement to refrain from the use of force or threats against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Kerch_Strait_incident#cite_note-84)

First of all the 950µg limit is the maximum work place concentration (MAK). MAK only applies to industry and craftman's jobs, not office jobs. And your apartment isn't covered by MAK either. Why do they need these high limits? Because in the industry they use things like welding machines which produce NOx. And since we don't want to make welding illegal, the limits are that high. The good thing is that young children, sick, and old people aren't on these jobs. So the people that are affected the most by NOx are not at risk. 

The ""Richtwert II"", the indoor limit were immediate action has to be taken, is 60µg. But why is it higher than the limit outdoors? Doesn't make sense right. Because outdoors is much bigger.

Basic idea is: In everyday life everything stays denoted in Euro, but all countries reintroduce local currencies with a free exchange rate to the Euro.

So for example, if i look at my bank statement, i'll have 2 numbers. One for the actual money i have in the local currency and one that denotes the the flexible value in Euro.

If i go to a supermarket, it's the same. Prices in local currency as the true value but also denoted in Euro. Payment can be in Euro (only backed by the European Central Bank) or the local currency.

That would give us the advantages that financial transfers between countries can still be made in Euros, consumers can easily compare prices with neighboring countries or even travel internationally, all the wile the individual governments gain back the ability to print money and with it influence the worth of their currency.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/a16y22/germany_urges_france_to_turn_its_un_seat_into_eu/eaphqis/,Alcobob,1543487391

Trade between the UK and Europe happened long before the EU ever existed and will continue after we leave. Even if the industry that people work in will be hurt by the impact of brexit, the idea that most of us are in a job position that is directly dependent on being in the EU is ludicrous.

I'm well aware of the dodgier laws regarding surveillance in the UK, but the idea of the EU being a police state comes more from small pieces of legislation in the civil law countries that UK citizens see as intrusive. Having to carry your ID around at all times so that you don't get put away for the crime of simply existing and being outside your house. Having to register your SIM card with the government before you can use it. Having to take your driving licence with you for every single car journey so that you don't get put away for the crime of driving your own car. The police force being a paramilitary with common policemen being openly armed in public etc. A lot of people see fascistic tendencies in rules such as this, myself included, not that I wish to blindly label anyone here as a follower of such doctrine. You didn't read my post properly.

The point wasn't the fact that benefits cost too much, it's that the average person is never going to make use of them.

That makes no sense. People don't care about that. They care about a cool car and they want care about how much money they spend per mile. Diesel costs more per gallon than gasoline. Thus the fuel savings you get from Diesel are negated in this aspect. Also Diesel engines are more complex and thus more expensive. So people buy cheaper cars were the fuel costs less.

&gt;...**The German taboo is [financial transfers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjnP1xLCZ68); the French taboo is treaty change. Ultimately, if we want Europe, both will happen,** I want to reassure everyone of that, but we must stop being afraid of the people. In terms of our approach, we must simply stop building our Europe in isolation from them. But we mustn’t fall into the trap of the populists or extremes, which consists in saying: “let’s ask the question in a simplistic way:  yes or no?”.  We know the answer: it is always “no”, whatever the question. We need to overhaul the European project, through and with the people, with much greater democratic stringency than a mere binary question.

Treaty change means here [French souverainism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souverainism)

1234,"&gt;China is not building parallel institutions to the World Bank or IMF

Yes they are. They have a parallel institution for the World Bank focused on Asia at the moment. They have also expressed repeated frustration about the current system and changing the status quo is a core goal of the Communist Party in China.

Xi in particular has been noted to have changed China's strategy to be more aggressive and parted ways with Deng's stay low strategy.

Whether it's successful or not, China is executing on a strategy to slowly reorient Asia around China instead of the US and to a lesser extent Europe. They obviously are hitting some road blocks like the Trade War with Trump, but are making lots of progress on things like the South China Sea too.

&gt;American institutions

They are in all, but name. Europe has a good amount of say too, but the US is the only country that has veto power in both institutions and there's been a long term tradition of the IMF being staffed by a European and the World Bank by an American. We can agree to disagree on this. China has a large economy and a population bigger than the entire EU and look at their respective voting rights when it's supposed to be based off of GDP. Quotas have an American and EU bias that is obvious. Or more clearly, friends of America as Japan has a bigger voting share than they do too.

I'm not going to comment on how effective China's investments are as I don't know how that will turn out. I do know that China's productivity over the long term is almost certainly going to pass the EU's and USA's as they have a much easier path to growth than we do as all they have to do is copy us badly to pass us because of their population size.

I'm not saying the US and EU are just going to roll over and let them do it, but I do think it's reasonable to assume that the World is going to look a lot different geopolitically in 2050.

First of all it's warhead which is not as important as delivery system, Second it's still cold war era warhead for LGM-118 Peacekeeper. Third their design is from 1982 and deployment started in 1986, not in 2007, what they did in 2007 is put them on old Minuteman-III.

Have been Trident updates? Sure there is Trident II which is also late cold war era delivery system from 1990. Further it's not like Russia haven't been updating theirs. Topol-M is 1994, RS-24 Yars 2010, RSM-56 Bulava 2011 and that just post cold war all of which are more new than what is in US arsenal while they also have late cold war design in arsenal.

He had previously spent five years in prison where he is suspected to have been radicalized.[20] He left for Syria only three weeks after being released from prison in September 2012.[21] If proven guilty, he will be the first European volunteer in the Syrian war who committed attacks upon returning to Europe.[22] A number of items were recovered from a bag he was carrying while being detained, including a Kalashnikov rifle, a .38 Special revolver, nearly 330 rounds of ammunition for both weapons, gun parts, cameras, clothing, and a gas mask. A hidden file containing a 40-second video was discovered in one of the cameras; in it, Nemmouche's weapons are recorded and a voice, believed to belong to Nemmouche by police, claimed responsibility for the museum shooting in an audio commentary.[6][9] He was said to have had a white sheet emblazoned with the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.[23]

&gt;a Jewish school in Toulouse

Some media have described Merah as an ""Islamic terrorist"".[12][13][95] Merah said that he resented France's ban on women wearing the burqa, and that ""the Jews have killed our brothers and sisters in Palestine.""[19]

He also wanted to avenge the French Army's involvement in the war in Afghanistan.[18][19] An editor at France 24 reported that Merah told him that these acts were not only necessary, but that they were to ""uphold the honour of Islam"".[54] During the murders, Merah said, ""you killed my brothers, I kill you.""[56][96] Journalist Ed West described this as an expression of tribalism, not religion.[93][97] 

&gt;and a kosher supermarket in Paris

In an interview with BFMTV during an ensuing standoff, Coulibaly stated that he targeted the Jews at the Kosher grocery to defend Muslims, notably Palestinians.[14][15] Thanks to a mobile phone line that was unintentionally left open, Coulibaly's dialogue with his hostages was recorded and transcribed by RTL (French radio).[16] Coulibaly said his action was revenge for the Syrian government action and against the Western coalition actions in Mali, Iraq, and Afghanistan.[16]

How come is that an politically incorrect fact?

Not only that but...

&gt;A number of studies conducted among the Muslim youth in various western European countries have showed that Muslim children have far more antisemitic ideas than Christian children- in 2011 Mark Elchardus, a Belgian sociologist, published a report on Dutch-language elementary schools in Brussels. He found that about 50 percent of Muslim students in second and third grade could be considered anti-Semites, versus 10% of others. In the same year Unther Jikeli published his findings from the 117 interviews he conducted with Muslim male youngsters (average age 19) in Berlin, Paris and London. The majority of the interviewees voiced some, or strong antisemitic feelings. They expressed them openly and often aggressively.[48]

&gt;A large number of violent antisemitic attacks in Europe were done by Muslims- the murder of 4 Jews in Toulouse in 2012 by Mohammed Merah,[49] the 1982 attack on the Jewish Goldenberg restaurant in Paris that was carried out by Arab terrorists, the kidnapping and murder of the French citizen Ilan Halimi in 2006 by a Muslim gang and the antisemitic riots in Norway in 2009 are a few examples to this phenomenon.[48]

&gt;Eastern Europe was less affected by the rise of Islamic antisemitism because of much smaller numbers of Muslims living in the area. Nevertheless, in areas and countries populated by Muslims, such as the Caucasus there had been an increase in antisemitism such as the attempt to assassinate a Jewish teacher in Baku in 2012.[50][51]

As far as I'm concerned, spend whatever you want however your people decide, the US will be providing a proper defense anyway unless all y'all demand to promptly leave NATO or something along those lines. My circle of interest has the US and Norway in it but not so much the EU countries, if the EU wants to make an army or not it's all fine by me.

1386,"Or the fact that EU membership might not bring them any benefits. I'm not shitting on the EU in this instance but it would do you well to clue yourself up as to why lots of people might have decided against staying in the EU rather casting a generalisation net over them, as you are accusing them of doing.

&amp;#x200B;

For lots of working class people in the UK, the EU isn't a thing that exists in their lives. Seeing middle class remainers complaining about losing their right to travel and work abroad is all well and good, but that argument is not going to convince working class people who can just say afford to go and get their groceries in and keep the lights on for the month. Working and travelling abroad isn't a priority, nor is it even a tangible opportunity for people who can barely pay for rent and food. Even if someone were to save up the money to eventually fund a move to a whole other country (and the whole range of prerequisites that come with it, e.g. learning a whole new language and culture, again, not high on the priority list for the average person) they wouldn't be likely to do it. Working class culture in the UK is very collectivist in nature, for many people a family network helps them stay afloat. People need family, friends and neighbours to come to their aid when times become dire. Upping sticks and moving is an option, but it comes at the cost of leaving all your family, friends and neighbours behind and starting over which for a lot of people, even those with money in the bank, just isn't something that's going to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Many people may also disagree with the direction the EU seems to be taking. Ever increasing federalisation and militarism seems to be commonplace throughout the continent and theres even calls for an 'EU army' which really scares a lot of people. The idea of such a large imposing force creates the image of a police state which the mainland already has a bad rep for in the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

Theres also the fact that as an island we're not really connected to the mainland in any reasonable way. You couldn't just get in your car and drive to Germany one day like you could on the mainland and even if you could they still probably wouldn't because as was mentioned before, the collectivist nature of working class communities means theyre likely to stick to their local area. The only area that really, tangibly benefits from EU membership is London, the pristine, centralised, shining capital that everyone thinks of when they imagine Britain despite the reality being much different. London's willingness to help out deprived communities throughout the country has been fleeting at best, and despite the EUs support packages to these areas they're still seeing their hospitals being closed down or privatised one by one, they're still seeing job opportunities steadily draining out of the area, they're still confronted with the fact that this christmas thousands of people will freeze to death in their own homes because they can't afford to keep the heating on.

&amp;#x200B;

EU membership means nothing to working class people, they will never make use of any of the benefits that the EU supposedly provides, but we're still seeing our economy tanking, more and more young people being unable to get a job, soaring house prices forcing people out onto the streets and with a membership fee of £13.1 billion (in 2016) to be a part of the EU which then provides middle class people with the privilege of being able to jet off to their villa in Spain whenever they feel like it and then dangling a bunch of benefits in front of our faces that we can never make use of, like a carrot on a stick, just isn't worth it to us whether we agree with the EU's policies or not.

&amp;#x200B;

This is total nonsense. You need to understand that gasoline cars in the European Union have way higher emissions than gasoline cars in other developed countries just because the emissions standards in the EU are so low. In other developed countries with high emissions standards like the US, Japan, Canada, South Korea, or Australia, there are almost no diesel passenger cars because they cannot pass the emissions standards.

&amp;#x200B;

Car companies make cars that can pass whatever the emissions standard is they need to pass. The only way to pass high emissions standards is with gasoline cars. You say that ""the emissions could be reduced a lot if the automobile industry would be correctly regulated"". But if the Automobile industry were correctly regulated in the EU then there would be few diesel cars sold at all.

It's possible that a scaling-back or outright closure of the site would have happened anyway, but the mere prospect of Brexit has apparently sealed a deal that might otherwise have hung in the balance for a few more years.

Brexit doesn't have to single-handedly be catastrophic for a company; all it has to do is lower the threshold at which companies are forced to make redundancies and closures. The number of companies closing shop here because of problems to their business caused by Brexit and precisely nothing else can probably be counted in the mere dozens (if that!), but the number forced to either make redundancies or put the brakes on expansion for the time being are far higher. Lost time, lost jobs, lost growth, lost improvement of living standards.

Lets see how it plays out. Germany has *already* contracted in Q3. If they have a bad Q4, then they are officially in recession.

Brexit Britain, just months from leaving with No Deal, is growing steadily.

As for unemployment, it may rise from the current 4% to 5%. But the people who lose their jobs will likely be Europeans on temporary contracts and they will gladly shake the dust of Brexit Britain off their feet and go back to Europe.

France on the other hand has unemployment of 9.2%. So if that increases as a result of No Deal to 10.2%, that will be painful.

Because it's now nearly three years since the referendum, and we've had non-stop hammering from Remain about how awful it will be, everyone in the UK is psychologically and actually prepared for it.

1678,"&gt;The entire speech is anti semitic. He is dismissing what happened to the Jewish people and saying so what, who cares about it.


Anti-semitic in your opinion. Why should the modern German pay the sins for of his father? 



&gt;That is not the definition of ultranationalism. According to Bugajski it's 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;ultra-nationalism resembles fascism, marked by a xenophobic disdain of other nations, support for authoritarian political arrangements verging on totalitarianism, and a mythical emphasis on the ""organic unity"" between a charismatic leader, an organizationally amorphous movement-type party, and the nation
&gt;
&gt;So no it's not just someone who takes pride in their culture. Funny really, you accuse me throwing words around without knowing their meaning yet it is actually you who does that. 

So nationalism used to mean just that. It's just the nationalism of 100 years ago. They're trying to make it sound worse by putting the ultra infront of it. But it's still just regular ole nationalism.


&gt;The AfD have show this in their actions. They have a xenophobic disdain for other countries. Look at the rhetoric they use towards other countries. For instance, Petry, who led the moderate wing of the party, thinks that the word völkisch should be used again, it should be brought into the mainstream. The word has distinct Nazi connotations and is defined as nationalistic and he wants it to be part of common usage again.

Was the word not used before nazis as well? For instance, Ukraine has a greeting that's been used by UPA and long before them as well. That being 'Glory to Ukraine - Glory to it's heros.' 



Xenophobia is classed as a prejudice against people from other countries. That is using a preconceived notion that is not based on reason. Assuming all Syrians or Afghans are terrorists is one such example. All of them are not terrorists or rapists and neither are the majority. Assuming that they are is a preconceived notion not based on reason, so it's prejudice against people from other countries, so it's xenophobia. 


I don't think anyone genuinely thinks that all Syrians and Afghans are terrorists and repists. Not even the most radical individuals would have such dubious opinions. Is it xenophobic to simply not want other cultures within you nation to prevent any possibility of a conflict occurring? Just a big ole no, to anyone that tries.



&gt;They believe that gay people should not be allowed to have the same rights as heterosexual people. That means that that are discriminating against gay people. That's homophobia. 

How is marrige a right? Deciding wherether to marry someone is at the discrettion of the priest. What right are they being denied?



&gt;And you appear to imply that this is fine because they are simply following their faith. Do you therefore allow Muslims to kill non believers because it's part of their faith?

They can do whatever the fuck they want in their countries. Doesn't consern me.


&gt;Their founder Höcke. I gave you the speech. Their other founder Gauland said that the **holocaust is a 'speck of bird shit in German history**. That it doesn't really matter. He's also been accused by historians of echoing Hitler. 

&gt;&gt;""Hitler and the Nazis are just a speck of bird shit in over 1,000 years of successful German history.""

Why the fuck are you lying? Also he said he doesn't like glovalists that have no care for the country they live in? Echoing Hitler? What a fucking stretch of truth that is.


&gt;Members of the party, who have not been removed, even disrupted a holocaust your and tried to deny gas chambers and the atrocities committed even happened.

They asked questions of the tour guide. Are they not allowed to ask questions?


&gt;Steinke called the man who tried to kill Hitler a traitor and said that Germany were forced to invade Poland. 

And it didn't take long before he was sent the fuck out.

&gt;His Nazi views were known long before this came out.

Yeah I'm sure everyone knew. /s



&gt;I've given you examples. They are not the only right wing party in Germany. CDU, CSU, FDP, the blue part and OKP are all right wing. 

How many of them are as outspoken as AfD? How many of them are as popular ans influential as AfD?


&gt;I've given you examples of the leaders echoing Hitler and saying that the holocaust wasn't really a big deal.

No you fucking lied.

&gt;The leaders and founders have said this. The leaders and founders have shown they are neo Nazis, so it stands to reason that the party that they lead and that they founded is based on their views.

No you and everyone else is trying extra hard to make them out to be nazis with baseless accusations.


&gt;I'm applying the term accurately. It is bad that you ignore actual neo Nazis, but you yourself have admitted that you share their views.

No you're fucking not. You're the type of individual that would equate Trump to Hitler. 

I bet you share Nazi views as well. Are you against animal cruelty? Oh look at that you share views with the nazis, and so do many people across the world.


&gt;Muslims aren't Semites. Some Semites can be Muslims, but not all Muslims can be Semites.

&gt;&gt;a member of any of the peoples who speak or spoke a Semitic language, including in particular the Jews and **Arabs**.


&gt;If they are then you are saying that Islam is not just a religion but a race as well. In which case you can be racist towards Muslims so we can add to the AfD list. 


What?


&gt;Israel also isn't homophobic. They allow gay people to adopt and they don't allow discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. 

[Not as progressive as you suggest.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Israel)


&gt;They are nationalistic though but they do not support the Nazi party, revere Hitler or Nazi symbolism and they do not they the holocaust. 

Netanyahu is a nazi appologist lmao. He said that Hitler never intended to kill the jews, and other shit like it.



&gt;It's odd that would call a logical dissemination of your comment stupid shit.

It has been stupid shit.

&gt;I look forward to your incompetent attempt to dismiss my claims.

And the victim, after it was explained to her, is still offended. That may be understandable, but doesn't justify everyone else being on the fence about it.

&gt;As of today, a court has to sit and hear the bullshit of this guy and his lawyer, to eventually says his parental rights are denied because of his criminal records.

Just like the court does for everyone else. Your proposed solution creates an unnecessary exception, and yet still would deliver the same result. So why add an exception, just because it's a rape case? What about theft, murder, drug trafficking etc?

&gt;Some bloke wouldn't decide shit, some bloke would apply a law that prevents rapists from applying for their parental rights, period.

This bloke would have to check every single case for the possibility of a rapist being involved. Unnecessarily I want to add, because that check is made at court anyways, for an even wider consideration.

I don't care, if you fuck without contraception, expect to have babies. It's your fault. Either way, the child's future isn't ruined for sure, how can you be so negative? There are plenty of people who grow up and raise up to the task of raising the baby.

&gt;Babies don’t just get born and are good to go. They need good parenting and irresponsible, immature or financial unstable people shouldn’t have children especially when they don’t want them.

Then don't have sex.

&gt;Also the purpose of sex is not only to make babies that’s just old, traditional, religious, communist thinking.
&gt;People have sex for plasure.

No, it's literally what it is, there are no other functions of sex. 

The pleasure derived from doing it evolved to entice humans to, yes, you guessed it - creating babies. If sex was not pleasurable to humans, we wouldn't exist right now.

Also, it's laughable that you called my thinking communist... You realize that abortion was legal in Poland during communism, yes?

Instead, completely local slavic teenagers of no religion use the public space for drinking while also slavic vagrants use other public space (where people actually hang out so they could beg for money, that kinda leaves parks out of the question) for drinking and smalltime crime.

There's a whole bunch of Africans studying at the university here, working, or having been living here since the the 70s, while very occassional muslims shop at the local malls or run their little currency Exchange or a corner shop or whatever.

Obviously an ongoing apocalypse, but I can already tell you haven't been travelling nearly enough since you can't seem to have noticed a significantly larger population of people from Vietnam or Ukraine and generally other slavs. I mean I get it, those slavs are as white as a travelling American, but the guys from Vietnam or Mongolia?

Nobody blockaded anything. But since it seems you have much more knowledge about the Kerch strait and can possibly even name the agreements that were made between Ukraine and Russia in 2004 and can name the steps you have to take to cross it you should know that nobody talked or thought about blockading it. Vessels no matter if civilian or military from whatever country as long as they are not transporting anything illegal or lack paperwork can cross the Kerch strait after getting on the right radio frequency and waiting in line.

Well. as you mentioned it, it is a complicated world. and it is hard to apply ""corrective"" measures that are fair. The classical example is how asians are discriminated against in applications to US campuses to achieve more ""diversity"". When you favor a collective, you punish another. And when you favor collectives, you dont consider the individual, and that is another form of discrimination.

That is why I think measuring by pure output is the best scenario, but that is a personal opinion, and i guess we dont have to agree to that.

To answer your last question. I dont have the knowledge to say if different races perform differently, and, in case they do, if it is social or genetic. For example, most asians I have met in my life are extremely hard working and disciplined, but i dont know if it is a cultural trait / learned behavior or a genetic tendency, I am afraid that goes beyond what I can answer.

I do think that men and women show different skills and traits (mostly, there are always going to be exceptions), despite what much of the left says these days (there are no biological differences / gender is a social construct, etc...) 
So there are gonna be certain jobs where statistically women perform better or worse, and there is absolutely no problem with that....and forcing a 50%-50% diversity in every job is doing society a huge disfavour.",,/r/europe/comments/a0xeb8/helsinki_to_begin_anonymous_recruiting_job/eamqr9r/,siegerroller,1543400906

2144,"&gt; I can only speculate about the reasons the polish government joined this alliance.

They have probably put way more faith into France and the UK then they should have had, that's true. We did the same mistake before 1938. Czech and Polish leadership reacted differently when realizing what shitty cards they had in their hands. Why did the Poles fight despite the overwhelming odds? 

Probably the military leadership and the army did not want to break their spine. They wanted to defend their country. The probably did not expect that should they lose, the war would turn so incredibly ugly against the civilians. They though that they are protecting the civilians (so primarely women and children) against plunder and rape. And that if they have to lose, that they will at least go down fighting. Probably they did not expect that their actions would have such detrimental effect on the population compared to the scenario where they did not fight as hard or at all.

When you compare that to us - we surrendered without fighting and yes, we were spared the level of destruction that Poland went through. We however until today have debates about what should have we done differently, whether it would have been better if we fought. Many people think that with this decision, we broke the spine of the nation. The men wanted to fight, but instead had to hand over the country in a humiliating way, without even firing a bullet. It demoralized us and left a long-term scar on our national psyché and many argue that it was one of the reasons, why the elites of our nation had such a defeatist attitude when the communist staged a coup. Many say that we have not really recovered from the trauma of surrender until today, that this defeatist attitude still remains in us, because the first time our young republic faced a big crisis, we were unable to stand up to it. So yes, Prague is still standing in its old glory and Warsaw isn't. But the material side of things is not always everything.

No to mention, that Nazis didn't really spare us destruction because we were so docile. They spared us destruction because we were so useful. We were by far the most developed and most industrial part of the territories that they controlled East of Germany. And so the reason why the reprisals and the brutality did not reach such high levels here was that Germany simply feared it could disrupt the industrial production. Poland never had such a big potentional to be this useful to the Nazis back in the 30s and 40s.

Wtf? Buying things from the US is spitting in your faces now? You can't possibly be serious.

&gt; and deny all cooperation with Germany in cause of general distrust. They work actively against an European defensive force for the same reason. 

They don't actively work against any 'European defensive force', whatever you mean by that, they take part in PESCO and coordinate with all European NATO members. They just value the US as a defense partner over you, which is quite logical. I really see no reason why they should value Germany more, you have no way close as strong military capibility as the US and you do not show the same level of commitment to Poland's defense as the US.

&gt; They prevent any compromise regarding the refugee situation

How so? Because they did not agree with refugee quotas this means they block any kind of compromise?

&gt; They often behave like Trumps puppet inside the EU.

They have better relations with the US than you, that's not something against you and no, it does not mean that they are Trump's puppet.

&gt; They also constantly stir up anti-german resentments and insult us by bringing up the war in their propaganda and political statements. 

I generally agree that some PiS politicians are more antagonistic towards Germany than they would have to be. I don't agree with their reparations claims.

However 'bringing up the war' is not something that is automatically bad. The war happened, Poland suffered because of it, it's not wrong to talk about it from time to time. And when some Germans act arrogantly towards us and basically treat us as some burden that poor Germany has to carry on its shoulder, I have no problem to remind them who caused unprecedental destruction to our region and who created the conditions for the Soviets to step in here. Because this is what happened. If you want to act arrogant and scold us down, I don't have the problem with reminding you. Act like an asshole and people will act like assholes to you, simple as that.

And you know what, I must admit that I am bit fed up with the attitude of some Germans on this sub, you included. You act as if you are somehow entitled to other's friendliness towards you. As if nobody can mention the war around you, in order to not hurt your feelings. As if the entire CEE Europe has the duty to like you, because afterall you've been so nice to us. And it's always the Poles and other Eastern Europeans who are not nice to you.

But the reality is that it's the [the Poles who still like you and it's not you who like them. You actually never liked them ever in the 2000 - 2018 period](https://www.koerber-stiftung.de/fileadmin/user_upload/koerber-stiftung/redaktion/fokusthema_der-wert-europas/pdf/2018/deutsch-polnisches-barometer/PL-DE-Barometer-2018_brochure_EN.pdf) (page number 5).

I don't have the data for other CEE countries, but I doubt that it will be much different.

Your countrymen were even the biggest opponents of our accession to the EU. You never even wanted us in your club.

So here you are, blaming Poland for their good relations with the US, yet if after 1989 the US was not the first country that actually pushed for our NATO membership, if they did not take this step to integrate us into the Western alliances, the chances are, that your country would extract whatever economic benefits from us, but politicially speaking would not touch us with a stick, out of the fear of angering your population and angering Russia.

It was only after the US took the step, when the German leadership decided that they would accept us in the Western alliances. And the German public still did not want us in even back in 2004.

Nowadays, your government behaves constructively and reasonably towards us, I cannot really say that they would be unfair to us and I am happy about that, I am glad we can have normal relations. I doubt that the public sentiment changed much though. The sense of superiority is something I feel from Germans quite often still today, including you. But you know what, you are not entitled for everyone else to tip-toe around you in order to not hurt your feelings and you are not entitled to be everyone's preferred partner in all aspects of international relations.

2160,"Russian protectorate was not a good idea after all.

*""During the reign of Peter the Great, Cossacks were used for the construction of canals and fortification lines in northern Russia. An estimated 20–30 thousands were sent each year. Hard labour led to a high mortality rate among builders, and only an estimated 40% of Cossacks returned home.
After the Battle of Poltava in 1709, the Chortomlyk Sich (sometimes referred to as the ""Old Sich"" (Stara Sich)) was destroyed and Baturyn, the capital of Hetman Ivan Mazepa, was razed. Another sich was built at the mouth of the Kamianets river but was destroyed in 1711 by the Russian government. The Cossacks then fled to the Crimean Khanate to avoid persecution and founded the Oleshky Sich in 1711 (today the city of Tsuryupinsk). In 1734, they were allowed to return to the Russian Empire. Suffering from discrimination in the Khanate, Cossacks accepted the offer to return and built another Sich in close proximity to the former Chortomlyk Sich (referred to as the ""New Sich"").*

*Fear of the independence of the Sich resulted in the Russian administration abolishing the Hetmanate in 1764. The Cossack officer class was incorporated into the Imperial Russian nobility (Dvoryanstvo). The rank and file Cossacks, however, including a substantial portion of the old Zaporozhians, were reduced to peasant status. Tension rose after the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, when the need for a southern frontier ended after the annexation of the Crimea. The colonisation of Novorossiya (New Russia) with Serbian and Romanians sponsored by Russia created further conflict.[1] After the end of the war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire for possession of the Black Sea and Crimean steppes, Russia no longer needed the Zaporozhian Cossacks for protection of the border region. Russia finally destroyed the Zaporozhian Sich through military force in 1775.""* wiki

2184,"Occam's razor, for starters: Look at the state Russia is in. The economy has essentially not developed much since the fall of the soviet union and is still reliant heavily on oil and gas exports, both of which are subject to high volatility. Most of the wealth is owned by a slim oligarch class that managed gto snatch their share of the soviet state corporations after the crass. Crime is high, median life expectancy is low, pensions are low. There's an ongoing brain-drain of talent because the rubble is in such bad shape that even educated people in Russia make comparatively very little. And so on and so forth. These are facts that even the Russians cannot hide, the income stats for example cannot be covered up, and neither can the life-expectancy stats. Equally, we know that there is o open journalism in Russia because you can actually read Russian media outlets and see that they're all pretty much uniform in their suport for the state and its actions.

It should be obvious from this angle to anyone who understands any history, that there are clear reasons for Russia wanting to try and prop up itself to be bigger and better for its own citizens than it actually is. 

Crimea's annexation was a blatant war-crime, and this is not disputed by anyone other than the Russians themselves. It served 2 main points: first and foremost the Russians felt the need to secure the naval base in Sevastopol to maintain their access to the Black sea. Sevastopol is the only major warm water naval base which doesn't freeze during the winter, so it's important geopolitically for them. The 2nd purpose is propaganda: because the state of the Russian economy is not good, Putin tries to project strength by playing wargames and annexing land: first in Georgia as a trial run, then in Crimea, and more recently in Syria.

This being the case, and yet at the same time Crimea being so clearly against international law of course they have to obfuscate the narrative and try to give themselves some credibility by trolling.

Meanwhile the Russians cannot compete in economic terms with the European Union / the single-market zone, which is over 7 times the size of the Russian economy.  Not to even speak of the United States. With sanctions in play due to Crimea they also cannot get funding easily from anywhere else except China really, which is a major problem for them because Putin wants to void them becoming too much of a vassal state of the Chinese. So they can't compete economically, and they can't use military action to get rid of the sanctions which are constricting their already 2nd grade economy, which is only going to get worse as demand for oil will start to drop as countries plan to move away from it.

So what's the only remaining tool they can use to try and improve their situation? Information warfare. By sowing discontent among the European Union countries aand in the US, they're ttrying to weaken their rivals and improve their own standing. And they've had partial success, the election of Trump is a positive for them, as he's by far the most pro-Russian president the US has ever had, and there's plenty of evidence of the Russians using trolls and fake accounts to influence his election. Brexit is also good for Russia because it weakens a unified Europe.

Put shortly: we know the Russian media lies constantly, and we know Russia is an oligrachy with an eroding economy and currency. It makes sense for them to use trolling and propaganda, whereas the west doesn't really need to do that because the facts are on our side.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/a0xmy6/front_page_of_rukraine_right_now/eamqyvm/,ZenOfPerkele,1543401290

2188,"back when [Poland disappeared from maps for over 120 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland), there was a whole movement dedicated to preserving Polish identity and language. one of the results was Polish having, for example, unique names of all anatomical structures that have been translated from Latin, which are being used to this day (as opposed to, say, English, which just uses slightly modified Latin terminology).

tl;dr: you have a nuclear capacity that's enough to power all the things even on a windless cloudy freezing day (high demand).

The next day, big wind, blue sky : great, your renewables churns at near nominal capacity. You now have to lower the output of your reactors.

Now, the cost of producing nuclear electricity is mostly sunken costs : initial investmensts, expertise, workforce. When running low, a nuclear reactor saves on fuel, of course, but that's only a fraction of the total cost.

So, now you have to maintain a *capacity* that's 150% the demand you need to meet, a grid that's trickier to pilot etc. You may even have to sell your electricity [at a negative price](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellynch/2016/02/19/negative-electricity-prices-are-not-a-sign-of-renewable-success/).",European Union,/r/europe/comments/a0vkde/france_to_close_14_nuclear_reactors_by_2035_macron/eammupr/,Neker,1543393550

But it is not inaccurate to say there was not a bond that extended beyond geography and ethnicity. The idea of Christendom and a united Roman empire that constituted the crusading peoples was very much common denominator and in the minds of the people of the time. 

Most of the manuscripts and books of the time that people commentaries on came from a period when Rome was more or less united and Christian. So there was an acute knowledge amongst the learned if how much was ""lost"". Not to mention that former safe areas for pilgrimage were no longer secure due to non Christians being in control. 

Finally some historians have tinkered with the theory that the Pope accepted to aid the emperor precisely to unite the fractured and anarchic west. 

One could say that the idea of European identity began to form at that time. Even if the term is anachronistic the idea of a shared commonality is undeniable. Sure there were subdivisions and sub ethnicities amongst the Christian forces (Latins, Greeks, Franks, Normans ect.) But there was a surface idea of unity.

2290,"&gt; That's sad, I really hope the EU's raison d'être is not just being an &gt;export market for German cars. Where should the expansion of the EU &gt;stop, then? Large parts of North Africa used to be part of the Roman &gt;Empire 2000 years ago, should they join as well? Or maybe former &gt;french colonies? Should the EU share a border with China? And why?

The problem is a bit bigger. Current world economy is based on consumption. No consumption - no growth - stagnation. 

There are several ways to deal with it:
* Search/create new markets
* Make current markets buy more

In the same time one must stay competitive, because except of the EU, there is also China and US (let's leave India aside for time, but it is also huge growing market). To stay competitive one must drive:

* Material cost down
* Make production technology more efficient
* Push labor costs down 
* Increase production quantities

As much as i know now, production costs of suppliers of biggest German industry ;) already reaching upper limit at current eastern EU members. China is not an option in this case anymore, same as India. 

So i hope it explains why **EU will have to expand**, if it wants to keep it economy going. Because new member provide not only cheaper labor costs, but they are also new markets for produced goods --&gt; profit!
And that beside new natural resources of new members. 
Where should it stop? Have no idea. My point is that unless the whole philosophy is changed, there will have to be expansionism. Or regular economic crisis, to reset things a bit. Except it is not good for the rating of politicians ;), so they will rather expand.

&gt;Ironically, this sounds very simialr to the situation we have now. &gt;Revolution in the Ukraine won, an oligarch became president, &gt;association to the EU has been ratified, but at the price of losing Crimea &gt;and civil war in the East. How is that more desirable than the pre-2013 &gt;situation?

I think you are confusing the cause and consequence here. Ukraine lost Crimea not because of revolution, but because neighbor country annexed it, which has been recognized by whole world with corresponding resolutions of UN and so on.. Even Putin himself admitted it later (interview is on youtube still). Annexation was planned well before revolution and independent of it. Russians just ""used the opportunity"", sort of saying. **Just check out the dates on Russian medals ""For return of the Crimea"" ;)**

**And there is no civil war in eastern Ukraine.** There is Russian aggression as well. Confirmed by OSCE PA as well as PACE. Corresponding resolutions are available on the websites of both organizations. Talking about civil war is retranslating Russian propaganda, sorry.

&gt;Again, this hasn't changed at all. Nordstream II will solidify our dependency on Russian gas.

No, if you compare the transported volumes. I mean, it diversifies logistics somehow, but does not change the supplier. So NS2 is making things worse for EU, in long term, taking Russian habit of twisting the valve at will.

&gt;But no… the EU had to take off a bite that turned out to be too big for them to swallow. 

Which bite do you mean? EU menbership? Not sure i get it right. 
But never the less, it is EU who more needs Ukraine as Ukraine EU. Current association and Schengen is quite alright for Ukraine already.

Same applies for nearest future to Belarus and Moldova.

And if EU to seek more independence from US now, those eastern states become even more critical. Just compare current military potential of Germany and Ukraine, for example. And take into account, that most of Ukrainian army went through some shit already, while German soldiers mostly didn't even smell the gunpowder till now (except of minority in Afganistan, Iraq and so on).

2315,"&gt;Yes but if you adjust for culture, it seems Switzerland has fewer crazies. 

Prove it. The rate of depression is similar between the two nations. There isn't a lower percentage of people with mental illnesses in Switzerland. It just has a far superior mental health care system.

&gt;The UK would have far more shootings if guns were more accessible, and taken to the extreme you get the US: more guns and crazies by far than the UK and Switzerland, both in absolute terms and per capita, and consequently far more mass shootings. Solution: make it harder for crazies to access guns. Licensing w/ police interviews, making them more expensive, and if it ever becomes possible in America: reduce the number of guns in circulation. Mainly semiautos since they seem to be the biggest problem with shooters.

Again, you are focusing on a very tiny subset of deaths (mass shootings). They are statistical anomalies in Europe. Nearly every European nation has laxer gun laws than the UK, a lower homicide rate and less mass murders of any type overall.

In the UK, after banning handgins, both firearm homicide and gun homicide rates rose.

&gt;Fifty-seven thousand people were compelled to hand in
162,000 pistols, 700 tons of ammunition, propellants and related
equipment. Owners had to make appointments at local police stations.
Payment was painfully slow and some compensation had not been paid
over a year after the items had been handed in. An army of bureaucrats
had to be assembled at the Home Office to handle all vast amount of
paperwork. The police resources required to collect, check, store and
then dispose of all these firearms, ammunition and equipment were
enormous. **The whole process of confiscating virtually all legally held
handguns took place between July 1997 and February 1998.**

I disagree. I haven't heard about antisemitism in Poland for a long time and I'm always looking at news sources in Hebrew. Some channels reported on it almost a year ago due to the controversy but evidently there haven't been any incidents in Poland lately so nothing is being reported. On the other hand, we do hear a lot about western-European countries as of late. Say what you want about our media, but they are fierce as hell (sometimes to an embarrassing and idiotic degree).

2416,"&gt;Your 1) is basically the supply and demand debate and irrelevant if we're talking trade balance.

Who's talking about trade balance?

&gt;For 2) one could argue (though I don't think so) that privatized infrastructure will run smoother.

It deprives the state of much needed revenue. Varoufakis said that the state should have a minimum stake (I believe he wanted 20% but I can't remember) in privatised infrastructure. This would've given the state some kind of stable source of revenue aside from taxation. The EU refused. 

&gt;Your 3) is essentially because the Greek debt is still high, if you're asking for more of it to be forgotten you should state it clearly.

No, I'm saying that higher taxes don't necessarily mean more revenue. especially if we're talking about a country's competitiveness.  

&gt;But still, deflation is slow and painful that creates a downwards spiral because economy depends on confidence and optimism so much, e.g. lack of prospects pushes the best educated youth to leave, and investors are less likely to fund businesses there

2418,"Close, but more egregious.  I was actually thinking of the excitement you guys had in your front yard prior to that:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogger_Bank_incident

&gt;The Dogger Bank incident (also known as the North Sea Incident, the Russian Outrage or the Incident of Hull) occurred on the night of 21/22 October 1904, when the Baltic Fleet of Imperial Russian Navy mistook a British trawler fleet from Kingston upon Hull in the Dogger Bank area of the North Sea for an Imperial Japanese Navy force and fired on them. Russian warships also fired on each other in the chaos of the melée.[1] Three British fishermen died and a number were wounded. One sailor and a priest aboard a Russian cruiser caught in the crossfire were also killed. The incident almost led to war between Britain and Russia.[2]

-

&gt; Similar accidents and rumours affected the Russian fleet: there was a general fear of attack, with widespread rumours that a fleet of Japanese torpedo boats were stationed off the Danish coast, talk of the Japanese having mined the seas, and alleged sightings of Japanese submarines. Before the Dogger Bank incident, the nervous Russian fleet fired on fishermen carrying consular dispatches from Russia to them, near the Danish coast, without causing any damage due to their poor gunnery.[5]
&gt;
&gt;After navigating a non-existent minefield, the Russian fleet sailed into the North Sea. The disaster of 21 October began in the evening, when the captain of the supply ship Kamchatka (Камчатка), which was last in the Russian line, took a passing Swedish ship for a Japanese torpedo boat and radioed that he was being attacked. Later that night, during fog, the officers on duty sighted the British trawlers, interpreted their signals incorrectly and classified them as Japanese torpedo boats, despite being more than 20,000 miles (30,000 km) from Japan. The Russian warships illuminated the trawlers with their searchlights and opened fire. The British trawler Crane was sunk, and its captain and first mate were killed. Four other trawlers were damaged, and six other fishermen were wounded, one of whom died a few months later. As the trawlers had their nets down, they were unable to flee and, in the general chaos, Russian ships shot at each other: the cruisers Aurora and Dmitrii Donskoi were taken for Japanese warships and bombarded by seven battleships sailing in formation, damaging both ships and killing a chaplain and at least one sailor and severely wounding another. During the pandemonium, several Russian ships signalled torpedoes had hit them, and on board the battleship Borodino rumours spread that the ship was being boarded by the Japanese, with some crews donning life vests and lying prone on the deck, and others drawing cutlasses. More serious losses to both sides were only avoided by the extremely low quality of Russian gunnery, with the battleship Oryol reportedly firing more than 500 shells without hitting anything.[5]

-

&gt; The Royal Navy prepared for war, with 28 battleships of the Home Fleet being ordered to raise steam and prepare for action, while British cruiser squadrons shadowed the Russian fleet as it made its way through the Bay of Biscay and down the coast of Portugal. Under diplomatic pressure, the Russian government agreed to investigate the incident, and Rozhestvensky was ordered to dock in Vigo, Spain, where he left behind those officers considered responsible (as well as at least one officer who had been critical of him).[5] From Vigo, the main Russian fleet then approached Tangiers, Morocco, and lost contact with the Kamchatka for several days. The Kamchatka eventually rejoined the fleet and claimed that she had engaged three Japanese warships and fired over 300 shells: the ships she had actually fired at were a Swedish merchantman, a German trawler, and a French schooner. As the fleet left Tangiers, one ship accidentally severed the city's underwater telegraph cable with her anchor, preventing communications with Europe for four days.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/a0uza9/impact_damage_on_captured_ukrainian_artilery_boat/eamcpwn/,vokegaf,1543379489

2422,"Hey, nobody has replied to you so I'll give it a quick go.

1) Large scale resistance would provoke wider conflict, which Ukraine would inevitably lose. 

2) The Ukrainian navy had very little support nearby and is vastly outclassed and outnumbered. Ukraine firing on Russian ships would give Russia justification to formally escalate offensive action.

3) Ukraine isn't doing that badly, they've been fighting a proxy war for some time now. Outside support is limited as nobody wants a war with Russia. 

4) If Ukraine properly responds and launches an offensive/direct engagement with Russian troops there would likely be a rapid and mass invasion by Russian forces. Ukraine would likely capitulate before any outside forces get involved, because again, nobody wants to go to war with Russia and will try to intervene through other channels.

Ukraine is a bit screwed. Do nothing and see more and more land and sovereignty gradually lost, or respond in force and see this happen much faster with a greater loss of life.

It would be way cheaper to keep US troops in Asia on Guam or Okinawa, but they couldn't assist South Korea quickly from there if it were attacked by North Korea.

Right now, both the US, China, and South Korea all dislike North Korea because they're insane. China doesn't want to assist getting rid of North Korea, because China is wary of US troops in Korea. But the only reason that US troops are in Korea is because of North Korea. It's a weird, chicken-egg scenario. I think over the long term the US, South Korea, and China will need to agree on some deal where South Korea takes over North Korea, China agrees to non-interference in Korea, in exchange for US troops withdrawing. Then everybody would be happy and Korea could be a unified state.

Same thing with Japan. Almost all the US troops in Japan are in Okinawa. That's not really anything to do with China, it's just a good place to have a base in East Asia.

If you go with that, we have worse than nuclear waste, we have dangerous chemical waste, most of these don't even degrade with time so they are permanent (so even longer than thousands of years).

&gt;    Nuclear power is safe provided that proper procedures are followed. If nuclear is the future that means even countries where corruption and incompetence is high will get into it. If even counties like Japan failed at procedure and had an accident most other countries where corruption scores are higher it would be a matter of when not if.

While I agree with that, Fukushima was the 4th biggest earthquake ever recorded + a tsunami all together and the impact of the nuclear disaster is one death and no long term issues on the population, it's just not what people think it is. The disaster was more the 18k death from the tsunami + earthquake and a good part of the country destroyed

They started by taking nicaea (which is in the very west of anatolia)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Nicaea
And defeating the turkish army some distance east from it
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dorylaeum_(1097)
After the defeat the turkish army did not openly try to stop the crusaders again but retreated with burned earth tactics. Crusaders split their forces with one part taking Edessa and one taking Antioch. Thus the main cities at the very east of anatolia were taken from turkish control.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Antioch

The following crusade of 1101 further recaptured ankara and returned it to byzantines. With that you basically have the entirety of Komnenian restoration of eastern provinces.

Wikipedia says: 

""The first Crusaders arrived in 1096 following Alexius' appeal to the West. The agreement between the Byzantines and the Crusaders was that any Byzantine cities re-captured from the Turks would be handed over to the Empire. This was beneficial for the Crusaders as it meant that they did not have to garrison captured towns and lose troop strength whilst maintaining their supply lines. The Byzantines, in return, would supply the Crusaders with food in a hostile territory and Alexius' troops would act as a reserve to reinforce them in any dangerous situations. The Crusaders first set about attacking Nicaea on 6 May 1097. Kilij Arslan I was unable to assist the Turks there due to the immense size of the Crusader armies; another small defeat on 16 May convinced Kilij Arslan to withdraw and abandon the city, which surrendered to the Byzantines on 19 June. After this, a decisive victory at Dorylaeum gave the Crusaders an Asia Minor that was open to attack: Sozopolis, Philomelium, Iconium, Antioch in Pisidia, Heraclea and Caesarea all fell to the Crusaders and they reached as far as Cilicia where they allied with Cilician Armenia.""

"" the establishment of the crusader states in the east helped ease Seljuq pressure on the Byzantine Empire, which had regained some of its Anatolian territory with crusader help, and experienced a period of relative peace and prosperity in the 12th century.""

When your military options become a binary choice of either do nothing or start off an apocalypse of bombs, how do you respond to non-existential threats?

The US tried adopting this policy of cutting back on most anything that wasn't to do with the delivery of atomic bombs, but soon found that its options were very limited because there weren't many steps it could take between standing by or sending the world to the stone age. Because of this the US effectively could only stand by in some embarrassing events like the Hungarian Revolution being crushed without providing a real check to the Soviet Union.

2561,"&gt; I am wondering if the question of economics is really that simple. Germany benefits greatly from having eastern europe be a part of the Eurozone. So do France, England, etc. but to a lesser degree. Subtract from that the billions and billions of EU money that goes into eastern europe and I wonder if the net difference is really positive for every western european country

Germany yes, but definitely not France. France has had a political net loss with the enlargement, and it's troublesome because geopolitical balance was good previously, and is tilted now, which is a concern not just for France.

The issue is not money IMO, I think it's okay that within a ""country"", regions that are mechanically favoured by things like geography and the fall of regional barriers reroute money to the regions that are not. Of course the EU is not a country so it's not a clear cut issue, but personally I don't mind that EE gets money.

The problem caused by the enlargement to the East is the throwing off of geopolitical balance in favour of the Germanic sphere of influence. A German person may think that it's rather good then, but no because Germany depends heavily on the stability of the Union, which itself depends on the larger members being satisfied with it (because they are the ones able to rock the boat the most violently, not because they matter more).

Now we're in a situation where two hostile forces are engaging in international water not knowing what kind of ROE other side is operating under. Russians had massive advantage in materiel, sure, but if Ukrainians decided to engage they could do massive damage to any Russians stupidly putting themselves in harms way. As such, Russians decided to disable them at range and done so. Afterwards Ukrainians couldn't return fire, or were not authorized to do so in first place (which again is not assumption you can operate under if you're Russian...), and were seized as a result.

2582,"To say that ''very few'' use ''jeg'' and ''eg'' is downright erroneous. 


Oslo and Akershus, two regions where only ''jeg'' is used natively, alone constitute almost one and a half million people. Then there's Vestfold and Østfold - about 500 000 people in total - where ''jeg'' is also exclusively (to my knowledge) used natively, not to mention the other counties where either most people (Buskerud, Telemark, at the very least) or many people use ''jeg''. That there's easily three million - more than half the population of the country.


Bergen and the surrounding area, ''eg'' strongholds, is home to about 400 000 people. Midthordland has 100 000, Sunnhordland 60 000, Voss 15 000 - together, that's more than 600 000 (presumed) ''eg''-sayers in Hordaland county alone; without mentioning numbers, ''eg'' is also dominant in Rogaland (both Stavanger, Haugesund, and the surrounding areas) and Sogn og Fjordane (although less so than in Hordaland and Rogaland). If we estimate one million ''eg''-s in Hordaland and Rogaland (not a big stretch considering Stavanger/Sandnes is 200 000 people and Haugesund/Karmøy about 80 000), that's a bare minimum of roughly one-fifth of Norwegians using ''eg'' - Sogn og Fjordane and Møre og Romsdal, counties where the form is also prevalent, not being accounted for.


Four million people out of five million people is hardly ''very few''.

2598,"Do you mean the 2008 crisis induced by the Lehman collapse? That's exactly when German economy started improving. Germany is one of the only major EU states that got out better than it went in. When was peak unemployment in Germany? 2005-2006. What caused it? The Agenda. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to get this and pretty much all economists agree. The short term shock of the Agenda on the domestic market actually caused unemployment to go up and a small crisis in Germany itself. Afterwards the comparatively lover wages in Germany compared with a weak currency made the country uber-competitive and unemployment dropped of sharply while it increased in southern Europe while in Germany much of the work is precarious and doesn't even earn you a living. This is not a point of debate. The point of debate is merely whether it was necessary. That's what a lot of mainstream economists pretend and I respect it more than ignoring the agenda all together like you do but I still think their way of thinking is frankly rather perverse. Because their solution to the problem is to merely deflate southern Europe untill they catch up with Germany which would take decades. And let's call the devil by his name. It was Sinn that invented the narrative of the sick man of Europe. The formula used in this connection stems from his 2003 book. Now I even agree that prices in the south need to fall to restore balance but it's not just the south that has to get back on a level playing field, Germany has to do so too by catching up with the wage surpression of the 2000s. The Agenda was economically speaking stupid at least if you believe in a Europe that works together. German economy was already recovering the years directly before the agenda. It was the agenda that caused a new crisis by running down the domestic market and long-term substituting it with exports (again that the agenda made it worse short term is not disputed and firmly backed by data). Now people like Sinn want all of Europe to repeat this but what they apparently don't understand is that not every country can run a trade surplus. Some have to buy your god damn stuff too. With a strong domestic market at least you have that but if we destroy that and all build for export, Europe will crumble.",For a Europe of the Regions!,/r/europe/comments/a0tzjl/germans_sentiment_on_the_eu_eastern_enlargement/eam7d99/,tobias_681,1543374341

I think you didn't get my point

Muslims have never forced an entire Christian population to convert to Islam or die or go somewhere else. I didn't claim that the Muslims didn't kill Christians. The comparison was that when Christians conquered a muslim place, like Circassia, Balkans and Spain, they usually forced the muslims to go somewhere else or die. Or convert. When Muslims conquered a Christian place, norm was enforcing some taxes, perhaps turning the biggest church into a mosque and that's all.

Seljuks sacking cities is also more related to their nomadic mindset than to Islam. The quote you replied comes from a Muslim Arab and he denounces what the Seljuks did judging from his tone.

Like spying on Germany, torture, and droning.

&gt;Without that, doing so could take months instead of weeks and at a far greater cost, making US intervention less likely. That’s a major component of their power projection and they use those 21 bases for many, many things.

America has more intelligence than they could ever need without the bases, if not there will be shared NATO intel in a war anyways. When it comes to equipment, here they got some of their equipment stored away ready to be used if that's a problem. If bases were necessary for US intervention, we would be in a lot of trouble anyways since Germany is the only European nation now to host major US military facilities. The only function of these bases from a European perspective is to play security theater and mark america's presence as you say.  F-or that you don't need 21 US-run bases and houses for officers built by the German taxpayer

When all that's said, why would they need such a rapid response from the US anyway? Russian military can't really afford too much at the moment and is in no state to carry out a conventional war with anyone. If they suddenly decided to be in a state for that, we can upgrade our defenses as well.

&gt;That will take a long time, perhaps over a decade. Right now Britain is embroiled in Brexit, Macron is terribly unpopular with FN pulling ahead in polls, and Merkel will be gone in two years, leaving a power vacuum. Italy is stumbling along with a silly populist and Eurosceptic government.

FN and those guys seem to be shifting their policy in less of an anti EU position, (and it should be said FN was even more ahead last time despite this recent newspaper hype).While these guys will probably be in opposition to a full on EU army, I don't think they would oppose an EU alliance.

2695,"Speaking from a Polish perspective: Germans are viewed as hard-working and good in management and planning, but also as cool-blooded, calculating, murderous barbaric thieves. This has a historic reason (Historic consciousness plays a greater part in Poland than Germany). 

Back then Poland had this huge Commonwealth with Lithuanians, we also had relations with Saxony, but once we've lost our independence to Prussia, Russia and Austria, it has clearly messed up our self confidence. We also remember the opressions against ethnic Poles, deportations and forced germanization of our country orchestrated by Prussia and all officially by law. 

This nightmare continued until 1918 when Poland regained its independence again. Then we have WW2 in which Germany sought to wipe us out of the existence, planned genocide while the rest 10% of the population should serve the Germans as slaves. Roughly 20% of population was killed, our inteligencja systematically eradicated, artworks and other goods looted and cities razed to the ground. After the war we switched from one evil to another. It has left a huge scar in our society, that it's impossible to forget all of these atrocities commited against us (We're not saints either but this war and its crimes where something beyond humanity). 

Even if Germans are nice to us, we don't think it's genuine because if the Allies hadn't stopped you, you'd continue slaughtering Poles until you got what you planned to do. Any form of German influence is viewed badly and as an attempt to rule over us again. It's comparable to a person suffering from PTSD. It'll take some time before they can ever trust you, but these 200 years simply cannot be forgotten, because it shaped our consciousness. It may be annoying to Germans but that's how we are. To be frank: They are hostile towards Germany because they are scared as hell to be under German rule or anything like that again.

&gt;From 1914 until 1923, Greeks in Thrace and Asia Minor were subject to a campaign including massacres and internal deportations involving death marches.

Because they could? It was controlled by the same power that was invading anatolia and it was much easier to get people behind taking the holy lands. 

&gt;Meanwhile, Seljuk control over Anatolia was not broken at all.

hmm? Byzantium took pretty much all the major cities back during the first two crusades. [Before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Crusade#/media/File:Aftermath_of_Manzikert.png). [After](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Seljuq_wars#/media/File:Byzantium1173.JPG). Seljuks managed to keep some lands in the eastern mountains.

No, ISIS is more like the rule than the exception. Every Arab Caliphate and the Ottoman empire were theocracies. The Caliph is both a religious and a secular leader. Jihad (the islamic version of a crusade/holy war) was declared frequently before a major war regardless if the war is defensive or offensive.

The Ottoman empire was a theocratic monarchy, religious law (sharia) was the main law of the land. The Ottoman Sultan also held the title of Caliph of Islam starting from Selim I (Suleyman's father).

Today SVT [the public broadcaster in Sweden] revealed the 28 acts that will participate in Melodifestivalen 2019. You might ask: ""What the heck has this got to do with gaming?"" My Answer: More than ever! The official Paradox- and *Crusader Kings* band **Pagan Fury** will be one of the contestants of the last semi-final hosted in Linköping February 23:rd, where they'll perform with the song *Stormbringer*. They are aiming Eurovision-high [translator's remark: this is painfully bad writing]:

""We are super thrilled and happy to share the fantastic news that we, Pagan Fury, will participate in the Swedish song contest Melodifestivalen with the ambition to represent Sweden and CK in the Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv 2019!""

This is courtesy of the band's Facebook page. Di Digital reports that this will also incur extra revenue for Paradox. Tobias Gustavsson, head of music at Paradox explains:

""We're acting like a classical recording company here, owning the intellectual properties to these songs, including our entry to the Swedish Eurovision Song Contest national competition.""

The band's music has been described as metal rock meets folk music. You can listen to a sample below this article. In this national semifinal, these debutants will amongst others meet Ann-Louise Hanson who is joining the nationals for the 14th time. Powerful stuff. This is also the first time that Ann-Louise Hanson breaks into Fragzone news. Even more powerful!""

&gt;  Bologna, November 23 - A Bologna preliminary hearings judge on Friday ordered the seizure of eight paintings including Titian and Tintoretto taken by the Nazis at the end of World War Two on Hermann Goering's orders and given to Yugoslavia.  
    The Bologna probe aims to get the paintings back.  
    It could be tough, however, given that Belgrade authorities have already rejected Italian prosecutors' requests to carry out judicial action in Serbia.  
    Belgrade is unlikely to agree to the seizure order, judicial sources said.  
    Therefore, diplomacy would have to come into the picture, they said.  
    The judge acquitted three Italian art experts accused of using goods of illicit provenance because they included the Goering pictures in a 2004 Bologna show entitled From carpaccio to Canaletto, Treasures of Italian Art from the National Museum of Belgrade.

- influx of crime from eastern europe, in particular organized crime

- money down the drain for countries that just spit in our face

- a good chunk of the countries in the east are just not willing to also take responsibility, but are in it just for the benefits without willingness to contribute

- economically it just creates a too big disparity to move forward with meaningful integration

- while the influx of workforce and the possibilty to have factories in the east that could have also mostly been achieved without admission into the EU

- If the admission was less rushed one could have made sure that these countries are more western aligned before they even joined the union

- I don't think that the expansion of the western spehere of influence is a good reason for admission into the EU if it works to undermine the EU itself. 

I don't think the argument that jobs are taken away is one people have because right now in germany there being no enough people to work is a bigger issue than there not being enough jobs.

Without these infrastructures renewable energy will be very expensive in Germany leading to it not being implemented at all, or you the consumer having to pay a hefty premium.

Look I'm not going to fight an internet war without being been able to provide proof. So I'm just going to refer these historians who wrote stuff based on proof.

 

&gt;The Spanish mediaevalist Eduardo Manzano Moreno wrote that the concept of convivencia has no support in the historical record \[“el concepto de convivencia no tiene ninguna apoyatura histórica“\]. He further states that there is scarcely any information available on the Jewish and Christian communities during the Caliphate of Cordoba, and that this may come as a shock in view of the huge clout of the convivencia [meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) \[“... quizá pueda resultar chocante teniendo en cuenta el enorme peso del tópico convivencial.”\] Dr. Manzano attributes the genesis of the convivencia myth to the Spanish philologist Américo Castro (1885-1972). But Castro’s conception “… was never converted into a specific and well-documented treatment of el-Andalus, perhaps because Castro never succeeded in finding in the Arabist bibliography materials suitable for incorporation into his interpretation …”[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Convivencia#cite_note-Qurtuba-2)  
&gt;  
&gt;During the [Muslim rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus) of much of the [Iberian Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula), Jews were living in an uneasy coexistence with Muslims and Catholics, and the relationship between these groups was, more often than not, marked by segregation and mutual hostility.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Convivencia#cite_note-Fern%C3%A1ndez-Morera,_2006,_29-13) In the [1066 Granada massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1066_Granada_massacre) of the entire Jewish population of the city, the Jewish death toll was higher than in the much publicized Christian pogroms in the [Rhineland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhineland) slightly later.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Convivencia#cite_note-Fern%C3%A1ndez-Morera,_2006,_29-13) The Jewish philosopher [Moses Maimonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Maimonides) (1135–1204) was forced to flee from Al-Andalus to avoid conversion by the [Almohads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad_Caliphate), which may have prompted his bitter statement that Islam had inflicted more pain on the Jewish people than any other 'nation'.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Convivencia#cite_note-14)

You mean ''how is Tito a Serbian dictator''? Because it's funny that you make such elementary mistakes while insulting my education.

Well, it's quite similar to what happened with Stalin, who clamped hard on Georgian people and allowed Russian domination in the USSR, even though he himself was not a Russian. A dictator cannot remain in power if he alienates the largest group in the country he rules over. Tito was a Croat, but he made Belgrade the capital of the country and allowed Serbian domination in the structures of power (ruling bodies, police, military, secret services) because Serbs were the largest ethnic group. The effects of that were seen after his death, in particular after Milošević's rise to power, when those structures, military in particular, quickly became de facto Serbian rather than Yugoslav.

In a sense, giving greater power to the larger ethnic group is logical, I agree. It's bad luck for us Croats that both times the Serbs were that larger group, since Serbian ideas of their role in history and visions of grandeur have proven to be quite harmful for their neighbours.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/a0kkem/albania_kosovo_plan_to_scrap_all_trade_barriers/eakv2rg/,krell_154,1543336247

This allowed the EIC to take control of Bengal (which can make a good argument for being the most valuable region in the world at that time), and then through diplomacy, coercion and violence extend its reach over the entire sub-continent.

&gt; was not a colony but a dependency

There is a distinction between settler colonialism and exploitation colonialism:

Settler colonialism: Settle population from the homeland to populate an ""empty"" territory. This was the MO in employed by the Spanish and British in the New World.

Exploitation colonialism: Take control (be it direct or indirect) over a foreign territory and use the local population to produce resources for your gain. The MO everybody used in Africa and Asia, as well was what happened in New France.

&gt; They committed such atrocities that the best solution at the time was dissolving the E.I.C., and it was a liberation from corporate tyranny.

It should be noted that the EIC had been in financial troubles for quite a while when it was formally abolished. And in the end, it was the Sepoy Rebellion that brought it to fall, a massive mutiny in the EICs army supported by a few northern princedoms.

And while the rebellion failed, it made the politicians in London realize that, should India ever erupt in a general rebellion, there was nothing the Empire could do to keep control of its most prized possession. So they abolished the EIC, assumed direct control and turned down the oppression just enough to keep India from rebelling but still plunder plenty of resources.","Ich bin ein Preuße, kennt ihr meine Farben?",/r/europe/comments/a0rxn7/europe_after_the_30_years_war_1648_1242x863/eakcd2j/,KlingonAdmiral,1543321609

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah#Ottoman_era

&gt;""Modern Ramallah was founded in the mid-1500s by the Haddadins (also: Haddadeen), a clan of brothers descended from Ghassanid Christians.

3281,"&gt; Nice projection. I realise success is not guaranteed. You on the other hand are talking about a ""small chance"" of success as if you knew what the chances are like. You don't.

Besides the point. There's a real chance that the conclusion of the research project will be ""we can sustain a nuclear fusion reaction indefinitely, but not one that delivers netto energy"". Then we lost both the money and more importantly the opportunity, and have clung to false hope all that time. Until it delivers, it's not an energy project; it's fundamental research. I'm all in favor of that, but let's not pretend we're doing something about the energy situation by funding it.

&gt;ITERs budget is currently projected at € 20 billion.
https://cleantechnica.com/2015/01/28/chart-subsidies-renewables-vs-coal-nuclear-subsidies-germany/
Germany spent € 85 billion on renewable subsidies between 2000 and 2015.

So it's at least four years if we take the average, assuming that there will be no more budget increases (which is unrealistic).

And that graph clearly shows that we can afford to do so for decades before the accumulated amount comes even near what fossil fuels and nuclear energy have gotten - and still are getting.

&gt;And looking at the coal subsidies, there really are much better candidates for freeing up renewables money than Germany's slice of ITER...

The point is that at the EU level, ITER is squeezing out alternatives and taking up a large part of the budget. The squeeze is felt there, and consequently, the resistance against the squeeze manifests there. If you can arrange that the budget will be *enlarged* for ITER rather than having to cannibalize renewable projects to supply yet another budget increase for ITER, I'm sure the resistance will be less. Just take it from the coal budget, and you'll even get support from the Greens in doing it.

&gt;It's really REALLY telling that you interpret it that way. I was just pointing out how totally wrong your idea of the respective budgets are. I want fossil subsidies gone and more spent on renewables too. I just don't want to sacrifice fusion research for it. And you have the gall to call the other side a ""cult"". FFS!

The cult comes popping up to say the money is better spent on nuclear whenever there's news on renewables, so perhaps try to target your attention more efficiently if you don't want to give that impression.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/a0i21v/surging_greens_shake_up_german_politics/eakcyjv/,silverionmox,1543322376

&gt; The same is true for the regions of any country, and for NATO and her members. The US is not going to maintain defense commitments and watch defense spending fall off a cliff -- that's why we first tried the honor system, then drove setting floors.

1) There is no legally binding threshold in the NATO about what countries spend on their defense.

2) The US would spend exactly as much on its military even if the other NATO countries would double their budget. Even suggesting the US has an **altruistic interest** when it spends money for its military is borderline retarded.

3) The European NATO members are not required to buy US equipment and that's the beauty right now.

Mainland Europe and the US didn't want the Jews in their own back gardens and therefore massively supported historical Zionism as a solution which Britain knew was going to be a disaster due to actually having tried to administer the region and understanding the complexities of the matter (Britain understood well the culture of the Arabs in the middle east; it had already toyed with the idea since WW1 and Zionism was strongly supported by British Jewish communities). Britain constantly advised caution when it came to the settlement of any independent Jewish state in the region, having learnt from the Arab Uprisings, but was unable to resist the wave of popular opinion on both continents. 

&gt;In 1938 the British government issued a policy statement declaring that ""the political, administrative and financial difficulties involved in the proposal to create independent Arab and Jewish States inside Palestine are so great that this solution of the problem is impracticable""

&gt;After World War II, in August 1945 President Truman asked for the admission of 100,000 Holocaust survivors into Palestine[33] but the British maintained limits on Jewish immigration in line with the 1939 White Paper.

Also it has the advantage of being both a seller and platform owner where other sellers compete and it uses the product data generated in order to better promote their products undercutting what are basically both their clients and competitors. One might say it is a conflict of interest. Their prime service (delivery 24/7) also has a competitive advantage in the sens that is has a client so huge they don't compete with anyone.

I think you might be confusing the East India Company with the British Raj. The Indian Princely States existed when the E.I.C. annexed India, indeed it was the feudal politics of the princely states that made the conquest so easy. Later the British Empire nationalised the E.I.C.'s assets and enforced centralisation. When we talk about the colonisation of India (a loaded term because India was not a colony but a dependency, but you don't *dependencise* a territory), we usually mean the latter event. The E.I.C. did not rule India, they owned it, and the people and places in India were property.

3391,"From what I’ve read on various sources over a variable time, the EU is not good for preventing monopolies concerning consumer electronics.

Moreover, there isn’t even a single EU-based consumer electronics tech giant in the likes of Facebook (US-based), Google (US-based), Samsung (Korea-based) or Huawei (China-based). You could at one day count Nokia (Finland-based), but even their reign has come to an end these days.

That is true. The EU could us help better in that area.

But the EU has helped consumers massively in other areas, all invisible to the consumer.

It has a massive influence on big B2B companies, like in the example above with the jet engines. Imagine how pricy sky travel would be if a company has a monopoly on a set of parts needed by every plane company. Those costs would be pushed to the consumer.

What the EU does here, is basically keeping companies smaller, in a way preventing giants from emerging, by letting them have competition.

That’s a big part why you don’t see giants of any kind in EU.

The EU has also a big budget for helping research. Think developing cures for different types of cancers if that helps. You wouldn’t see anything happening if you don’t have those types of cancer, thinking the EU did not do anything to help you. And you’re right. Not you specifically.

And when that medicine is available, you easily take it as granted, not knowing the EU helped development for you.

But that could be equally true for new types of touch screens, developed in the EU and then bought up by current tech giants. You never hear about companies like that, though it does help you in your electronics.

The EU are terrible, terrible marketeers. Unless you do some research yourself, they don’t really communicate what they do and how it’s beneficial to the EU members. That’s another point of critique.

So it’s not you. What you think is normal. It’s the (lack of) the EU’s marketing team.

3499,"Well from ease of pronunciation point of view, the language background obviously matters. Like for you, there is a distinct double s in Odessa, enough to make it noticeable in an English text, I am ""deaf"" to the distinction and would just roll over it not noticing which way it is spelled, unless I concentrate. The other way around for -iv, -ov and -ów, with my language background I do not see Lviv Kharkiv as being any more difficult to pronounce than the Russian and Polish variants. If anything, an unprepared English speaker might make a mistake in Polish ones, not because the ""uf"" sounds at the end are somehow difficult to make, but because they may not know what the ó means. But we'd need an unprepared English speaker to check that :)
""Kyiv"" I agree with you - the base Latin alphabet is just not equipped to represent half of the sounds in that, and two of them in a row, it's like someone with Cyryllic and Russian background only saw ""Кийуф"" in Poland. I wonder, what would an unprepared English speaker make of words with just one of those sounds, like ""hodyty"".

From a non-linguistic point of view, well, if Ukrainians do not make a fuss about beings culturally distinct from Russia, noone will do it for us. Same goes for Ukrainian officials chasing mapmakers around the world making sure they do not mark Crimea as Russian. Will changing the color fill in a map bring Crimea back? No, of course. But not insisting on it will normalize the status quo. And believe me, while Ukraine dithers and thinks whether it would not be too silly to insist on certain spellings and engages in all that kind of hand wringing, Russia will have zero qualms about perpetuating their ""cultural and linguistic unity"" myth, which they eventually use to bring war.

Imagine that you have a land dispute with your next-door neighbour, a large company that has appropriated parts of your garden. Sure, demanding that your rights are respected will not guarantee the court taking your side, but being too shy to make a fuss about it guarantees that noone really takes your side at all.",,/r/europe/comments/a0neg7/map_of_martial_law_in_ukraine/eak5hw8/,vstromua,1543308856

The Baltics considered themselves as a continuity of their pre-1940 status, as opposed to newborn independent states, and were not included in this agreement. Therefore, you do indeed have continuity of government - not with the USSR transforming into Russia, but the RSFSR claiming - with the agreement of the other former constituent states - continuity with the USSR, and *then* becoming the Russian Federation.

Not a comparable situation because Japan didn't have nukes.

Hypothetically...let's say there's a war between Russia and NATO. NATO's war goal will be to effect regime change in Russia, not to conquer Russia or wipe out the Russian people. If the Russians use nukes, they and everyone else will be annihilated. If they lose the war conventionally they will continue to exist. So the choice is between defeat and annihilation.

like they do in Russia. Also the West has been raging about the state of the media in Poland and Hungary for the last year, and they are not even close to the level of suppression as in Russia. So you think the West is just ignoring everyone except Russia, it's not. 

&gt;No it's the truth.

Prove it. New information has revealed the Russians only acted when the boat was trying to leave. So already it is obvious Russia is lying because if it was really about protecting their water then they would have stopped then before they even reached Mariupol. So Russia just attacked a Ukrainian shop wounding it's sailors.

3622,"They are not comparable at all. You wanna compare, compare Morea and Udbina. Imagine the shitstorm if Albania used the same logic on those two regions to claim them, it would be rightfully criticized to hell and back. 

Kosovo is to Serbia what [Morea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morea_revolt_of_1453–1454) is to Albania. Morea too had significant Albanian popularion in the Middle Ages, it’s the reason of why there are Arvanites today in Greece. Morea too was [a region where Albanians dedicated songs about its fall to the Ottomans](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qMJpBnZEm24). And yet, Albania today does not care about Morea because since Middle Ages until now the demographics changed. Albanian songs might remember Morea, but Albanians have moved on. Morea is Greek and it’s perfectly fine. 

Or to [Udbina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udbina) in Croatia. Albanians have [17,000 lines long epic poems](https://e-leximi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/eposi-i-kreshnikeve-dhe-legjendave.pdf) of wars Albanians have partaken there and guess what, nobody cares about Udbina today either. The Balkans demographics have been shifting all the time, it’s normal. That’s why people of different ethncities have cultural impacts in multiple regions that today have different demographics. And yet cultural history is not a reason to discuss people today. It’s not fair for Albanians to claim Udbina today just because it played a role in Albanian culture in the past; cultural improtance is not a reason to claim territories. 

This is why the Medieval claim on Kosovo is weird. The Balkans have been pretty mixed places and demogrpahics and ownerships have changed all the time. This is why the criteria today is listen to what the people inhabiting want want. By the time of Albanian independence, Kosovo had an Albanian majority. And I included Kosovo during “Albanian independence” because it was part of the Albania that declared independence from Ottoman Empire in 1912. And then [it was forcefully separated from the independent Albanian state of the time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Albania) and attached unwillingly to a country they had no relation with in ages. That’s what they want to change, the results of that separation which the inhabitants themselves deem unfair, not outside factors. 

Things changed, history happened. People who live today in Kosovo are different from the ones in old Serbian songs, they feel no connection to Serbia. Just like people in Morea and Udbina today feel no connection to Albanians, and that’s perfectly fine. Kosovo’s cultural importance to Serbia is not a special case in the Balkans, it has never been. Other people of the Balkans, including Albanians, do not claim anything comparable to that.

3681,"&gt; Hypothetically...let's say there's a war between Russia and NATO. NATO's war goal will be to effect regime change in Russia, not to conquer Russia or wipe out the Russian people. If the Russians use nukes, they and everyone else will be annihilated. If they lose the war conventionally they will continue to exist. So the choice is between defeat and annihilation.

I think you misunderstand, based on the false choice you present. When Russia will start nuking it will start by tactical nukes against naval units and hostile troop concentrations close to or within its own borders. This will make victory against Russia through conventional weapons impossible, while also not escalating things to the point of total annihilation. Therefore the likely end game options in a conventional invasion of Russia is defeat or a draw.

&gt; Even if Russia's leadership were callous and prideful (and stupid) enough to choose the nuclear option, I wonder if the people in charge of pushing the buttons would.

You do realize there is a rigorous testing and selection process to make sure, that the people responsible for pushing the button are going to push the button when ordered. I'm not saying its impossible they would refuse to launch nukes, but you shouldn't count on them being average Joes who'll decide things based on their conscience.

Individual European countries are great at handling problems, see the Poland-US relationship, or the UK-US relationship, or the French-US relationship, for some reason when you all turn inward and let the EU decide, it can't decide with any needed speed.

The law allows authorities even more than quoted in case of martial law. But the exact same law defines martial law only applicable to whole country, not parts of it. Additionally we never had it being used. And even that same law allows, in case of using it, to define what exactly is being limited for citizens, in presidential decree. 

Today, while doing a speech in parliament under transcript president added edits to his second edition of the decree to add notion about martial law being used only in parts of country close to border or seas.

So these two had worked together for this guy for   a while now, and they both didn’t speak English very well and they both didn’t speak the others native language.. so guess how that went? 

Over the course of 4 months, I watched these two clowns shout at each other and throw everything from onions and sausage to wrenches and screwdrivers at each other.  The polish guy would shout “Kurwa Mac”!!! at the other guy about ten times a day and vice versa, his co worker hurling Spanish insults right back at him. No matter what, they always got their job done and figured it out. It was exhausting and funny at the same time. 

These guys were a source of laughter and smiles for 4 months, and I ended up having a blast working along side these guys day after day.

3861,"It comes to the fact that the similarities are so common that when one gets to differences they are almost surprising. But in the end these are the words that make the difference. For instance the word *bun* as a hamburger bun one says as *žemľa* in Slovak and *houska* in Czech. And even if I know the meaning of *houska* when I hear the word it is something that I would not come up as a word naturally when speaking.

One example for you to understand is the term *czerstwy chleb* which means old bread in Polish. But *čerstvý chléb* in Czech or *čerstvý chlieb* in Slovak actually means fresh bread in both languages. So just imagine your frustration of explaining to your Czech/Slovak colleague a recipe that needs old bread and they understand fresh bread instead. A famous similar example is the word *kapusta*. It means cabbage in Slovak and cole in Czech. One says *zelí* for cabbage in Czech. 

So there are landmines like this all around. Now it may not be as dramatic as one word meaning complete the opposite as czerstwy vs čerstvý but there is enough of idiosyncracies that even if one understands the spoken language from context you cannot actually speak to the same extent. It is quite interesting. If Czech and Slovak speak their respective languages they mostly can understand each other but when they try to speak the other language and the recipient does not expect these landmines it can be very surprising and confusing in a result. That is why it is better to stick to native Czech/Slovak so that the other party can turn the mental switch to difuse these landmines.

Trump is the most unreliable US president ever, a coward and actually Putin's bitch.

If Russia decided to invade Poland on bogus reasons, that's what they do, Trump would probably give them "" the benefit of doubts"" because that what he does.

The UK and France wouldnt risk total nuclear winter and the end of their countries to save some polaks. So with Germany and the EU they would put massive sanctions, make some huge joint statement declaring Russia persona non grata everywhere, you would see billions and billions of tweets white and red ""Never forgat Poland"" #jesuisMetooPolak etc and that's about it.

NATO is anachronic and pretty much dead. Just an american tool to sell weapon and control its ""allies"". Trump made that pretty clear and every EU leaders with half a brain understood that.

 That's why current Poles actions, to buy americans weapon instead of building europeans military industry, using their land to host american proxy war playground demonstration every other month and keep pissing Russia and making bold statements while hiding behind The USA, NATO and the EU is completly moronic.

Considring the number of times this country has be annexed it's amazing that there are still people speaking the language. Some brighter civilization disapeared for much less than that. You shouldnt push your luck, maybe nobody will be able to bail you out next time.

What Poland needs, just as the rest of Europe is to help Russia to get out of that parallel universe they entered in october 1917, a century ago. Help them get ride of their oligarchy, develop their country and misdle claas and teach them to value democracy.

3894,"Yep. The most common martial law pic in Eastern Europe for the West seems to be communist Poland in the early 80s, so not a good comparison PRwise, but I understand why they do it.

As for the lingustic topics, in Poland now most cities even officially use Breslau, Danzig or Warschau in German speaking ads and materials, but I guess some still don’t like it, and anyway a long time has passed, so I understand that the Ukraine’s situation is different, but the spelling issues are still, well issues. And while some interpret it as taking sides, it’s basically an issue of easier pronounciation and tradition for most. Kharkov is just easier to pronounce than Kharkiv, Lvov than Lviv and Odessa is the logical spelling for English speakers. And Kiev/Kyiv is the worst one of all, as from Chicken Kiev to pure pronounciation, the Ukrainian version is just harder. Also, as an expat living in Warsaw, I find the name changing trend even weirder, as Poland seems to be one of Ukraine’s biggest allies, but uses traditional (so “Russian”). Lviv is Lwów and the local beer imported to Poland is “lwowskie” in the Polish language version (and yeah, I know Polish has the w as v issue, but I’m not talking about that part as it’s not political). Kharkiv is Charków, pronounced closer to English Kharkov, as the I is just not fitting for Polish speakers. Odesa is Odessa with the double S pronounced, so unlike, Russian, Ukrainian or English. Kyiv is and always was Kijów (so in an english translitararion say Kiyov, so closer to Kyiv). So basically the names people use don’t mean anything about their attitudes. Also there are places that have it worse than Ukrainian cities, like Latvian Daugavpils. Sure, orfficial sources in most countries will call it that, bit say in Polish colloquial Polish it’s basically Dyneburg or Dźwinsk (from German or Russian), as the Latvian name is too hard. And yet no Pole would accept German or Russian rule over it now. So I think putting names and spelling into disputes is pointless and only causes confusion, that is why I noticed the S and thought you did it to make a statement as many do ;)

And while it's sad to think about it, with the Polish hostilities against Germany NS2 might become necessary rather sooner than later. With Poland calculating the 1 trillion Euro reparation demands I wouldn't rule it out that they'll threaten to cut off our gas supply if we don't pay.

&gt;Forcing Europeans to learn English

Europeans have been learning English for a few decades now and never was forced by the EU. 

&gt;a European lingua franca

There is no European lingua franca. There is a world's lingua franca, and that's English, regardless of what EU wants to push. 

&gt;why would you accept English post-Brexit?

Why post Brexit would make a different?

&gt;Why not go for a widespread European language then like French or German? 

So above you complain about lack of pride and now you want other Europeans to be forced to learn another foreign language just to not be English? Are the other EU countries supposed to become simply German and French regions!? Without the UK, English is even better choice, as it doesn't favor any major power within the EU. The French and the Germans are already arrogant enough, let alone if they expect us to know their language... I propose us to learn Basque or Hungarian, just to make it interesting.  

And again, there is no language pushed by the EU, neither European lingua franca. English has took the place as lingua franca due to its huge soft power.

‘You are under military law,’ ran the forceful reminder, ‘and you are still subject to punishment. Don’t speak about weapons, tactics or losses. Don’t speak about bad rations or injustice. The intelligence service of the enemy is ready to exploit it.‘

’One soldier, or more likely a group, produced their own version of instructions, entitled ‘Notes for Those Going on Leave.’ Their attempt to be funny reveals a great deal about the brutalizing affects of the Ostfront.

‘You must remember that you are entering a National Socialist country whose living conditions are very different to those to which you have been accustomed. You must be tactful with the inhabitants, adapting to their customs and refrain from the habits which you have come to love so much.

Food: Do not rip up the parquet or other kinds of floor, because potatoes are kept in a different place.

Curfew: If you forget your key, try to open the door with the round-shaped object. Only in cases of extreme urgency use a grenade.

Defense Against Partisans: It is not necessary to ask civilians the password and open fire upon receiving an unsatisfactory answer.

Defense Against Animals: Dogs with mines attached to them are a special feature of the Soviet Union. German dogs in the worst cases bite, but they do not explode. Shooting every dog you see, although recommended in the Soviet Union, might create a bad impression.

Relations with the Civil Population: In Germany just because someone is wearing women’s clothes does not necessarily mean that she is a partisan. But in spite of this, they are dangerous for anyone on leave from the front.

General: When on leave back to the Fatherland take care not to talk about the paradise existence in the Soviet Union in case everybody wants to come here and spoil our idyllic comfort.

He just tells the world: Deal with it. Now the media wants to portray Trump as some lover of dictators, he isn't any more of a lover of the Saudi's or the Russians then Obama was. He's just upfront about it.


Also, media has been portraying him like he's in bed with the Russians. Vocally he might induce such thoughts, but his actual policies have been way harder on Russia then Obama's. Obama didn't want to provide lethal aid, so far Trump has provided over a billion dollars worth.

First of all a YouTube view does not equal a human being, and that video was most definitely not only viewed in Serbia, but in the whole region, because we all thought ""Finally somebody caught those corrupted officers in action."" But it was far from that. 

If it's the video I'm thinking of, the officer didn't speak English at all. He looked absolutely confused and tried to solve the situation. As far as I remember, he tried to explain that you can either pay at post office or at the scene (of course, paying later meant paying more) and tried to convert Serbian dinars to Euros for the guy. He might've tried to get a bribe from him as well, but we couldn't tell for sure, because the guy that got caught was so fucking loud and annoyed at the officer, and officer looked completely lost because he couldn't speak English. After that he called for his partner to help him out, because he knew English a bit better, and the video pretty much ended at that point or smth.

Bottom line, the officer may have tried to get bribes, but you couldn't tell from the video. What you COULD tell is that the people in the car were acting very rude and arrogant.

You've got your head so far up their rear that you even repeat the same things they say, next you are going to tell me that Coca Cola is older than Azerbaijan.

The first nation state was created in 1916. That doesn't mean that the ethnic group never existed. Kurdistan has never existed in human history, that doesn't make a future Kurdistan an invention, does it? Or it does only when it applies to Turks?

&gt;The genocide was one

What does it have to do with Azerbaijanis?

&gt;many unprovoked massacres and pogroms against Armenians preceeded and followed it. 

You don't know the history well it seems. Massacres against Armenians is unprovoked, massacres against Azerbaijanis is provoked. Armenians always the victims huh.

&gt;I said nonindigenous turkic populations to mean the turkic populations of the region, the turks and the transcaucasian tatars. Other turkic populations like Kazakhs are still in their ancestral territory and have not being as aggressive, nor done any massacres and pogroms that I know of. 

I'd like to know where you get the courage to speak so surely of many topics you have little understanding about? How inflated is your ego and sense of knowledge? You have a very poor understanding of many issues. 

I personally think 1000 years (since you are ignoring any Albanian or Iranian ethnic continuum) is enough to be considered indigenous. Your comment about Albanians having nothing to do with Azerbaijanis is also hilarious. You should go complain about the Armenians displacing Lezgic speaking peoples and taking their lands, how Armenians are not indigenous and are an invading people who established themselves in Eastern Anatolia where they mixed with Semitic people.

&gt; Juncker: Countries that leave migration pact did not read it 
&gt; 
&gt; November 12th 2018, 13:29pm 
&gt; 
&gt; Austria, Hungary, Poland, Croatia and Bulgaria would overlook the fact that the pact would reduce the number of illegal refugees, according to the EU Commission. Education Minister Faßmann also considers the global approach of the Pact ""right"". 
&gt; 
&gt; Vienna/Brussels - The EU Commission certifies that states wishing to leave the UN Migration Pact do not know the content of the document. On Monday, a spokesman referred to the statements made by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that ""those countries which leave the Pact would not have done so if they had read it"". 
&gt; 
&gt; The accusations by countries such as Austria, Hungary, Poland, Croatia and Bulgaria that the pact blurs the dividing line between illegal and legal migration were not true, the Commission said. In reality, a shared responsibility in the migration issue would result in fewer illegal refugees. 
&gt; 
&gt; Faßmann: ""Global approach the right one"". 
&gt; 
&gt; Education Minister Heinz Faßmann (ÖVP) had spoken out over the weekend in favour of further negotiations on the migration pact and complained about the late discussion within the government. However, he also conceded that the Pact had not defined essential things and that further negotiations would be necessary. But the global approach was the right one.

4432,"&gt; No I believe how the referendum was run was in itself a farce
&gt; 
&gt; Not only was there illegal activity, but it was incredibly misleading

yeah, but the illegal activity should have been sanctioned and blocked before the results came out, not after, otherwise voiding the result of the referendum because of it might look like a pretext to cancel an unwanted outcome in the eyes of the average leave voter. And you don't want the voters to feel disenfranchised , do you?

&gt; Plus most polls are now heavily leaning towards the general population wanting to remain, so wouldn't it be 'the will of the people?'

Yes, but at some point you have to draw the line. As polls reveal, the will of the people can change subtly from one day to another, so what are we going to do? vote every second week because there is a 1% shift in the opinion of the people? You have to draw a line somewhere. Besides, as far as I know, the polls suggest that people are leaning towards remain , but only marginally. It would likely be the same 52/48 split of two years ago, just with reversed positions. Hardly enough to warrant a meaningful change of mind of the British voters.

Personally, I would be in favour of a second referendum with remain as one of the options, but only valid if remain won with +65% of the votes.",South Tyrol,/r/europe/comments/a0gztb/as_the_uk_prepares_to_leave_the_prevailing_mood/eahxvkl/,standy85,1543235242

In addition Germany still has its big ""unclean"" car industry.

There are a few other important points why the Greens rose in Germany. The social/center-left party (SPD) is doing really bad thus a lot of them switch to the Greens, the conservative party (CDU/CSU) seems to want to move to the right, thus people in the center turn to the Greens.

Germany doesn't have much unused capacity for hydro, and solar is less than ideal at Germany's lattitude, not to mention that the consumption and production peaks are phase shifted. Germany is going to be very reliant on importing electricity abroad, derived from coal, gas, oil and nuclear. Wind is unpredictable, and rarely matches the consumption pattern. There are energy storage solutions, batteries, that can be used to help mitigate underproduction, but they're usually used to handle peak demand until gas turbines can spin up and start delivering power to the grid. 

Sure, the national numbers are going to look pretty good, but they're going to be masked by import and the sources of that energy.

Are you aware about USS Donald Cook case? Truth or not, it makes you look weak, demoralize allies and emboldens enemies.

&gt;On 10 April 2014, the USS Donald Cook entered the waters of the Black Sea and on 12 April a Russian Su-24 tactical bomber flew over the vessel triggering an incident that, according to several media reports, completely demoralized its crew, so much so that the Pentagon issued a protest.

&gt;The US destroyer is equipped with the most recent Aegis Combat System. It is an integrated naval weapons systems which can link together the missile defense systems of all vessels embedded within the same network, so as to ensure the detection, tracking and destruction of hundreds of targets at the same time. In addition, the USS Donald Cook is equipped with 4 large radars, whose power is comparable to that of several stations. For protection, it carries more than fifty anti-aircraft missiles of various types.

&gt;As the Russian jet approached the US vessel, the electronic device disabled all radars, control circuits, systems, information transmission, etc. on board the US destroyer. In other words, the all-powerful Aegis system, now hooked up - or about to be - with the defense systems installed on NATO’s most modern ships was shut down, as turning off the TV set with the remote control.

&gt;The Russian Su-24 then simulated a missile attack against the USS Donald Cook, which was left literally deaf and blind. As if carrying out a training exercise, the Russian aircraft - unarmed - repeated the same maneuver 12 times before flying away.

&gt;After that, the 4th generation destroyer immediately set sail towards a port in Romania.

They inaugurated the ""The Cathedral of the People's Saving"", a mammoth of a church that's still a building site. Until now they pumped 110 million euros into it, cutting down money from Education and Health - this in a country with the highest illiteracy in UE and a deficient Health System.

With some new regulations following the [Colectiv Nightclub Fire Tragedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectiv_nightclub_fire) it's mandatory you have approval from the Institute of Emergency Situations when holding a public event - they didn't get one here because of the building still being a working site. But nevertheless they hold the ceremony with thousands attending and the constructor was fined 10.000 euros for this.

People were not allowed to enter although they came from all around the country - only public figures were allowed inside. And of course the modest cars in which our clergyman go around (like Maybach S) in one of UE's poorest countries.  
And just to top it all off the Cathedral's bells are the biggest (at least in Europe) and cost 550.000 euros. The biggest of them has the Patriarch's face engraved on it - *""Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image""*

4810,"&gt;What?

The police violence thing was posted by a guy from Kosovo (or guy with their flag at least). He made a post a while ago about Serbia still doing ethnic cleansing etc. and posted a whole bunch of links to  shit that had absolutely nothing to do with ethnic cleansing. One of them was a police officer seemingly using way too much power during an arrest. That was his ""proof"" of ethnic cleansing.

But because hating Serbia and Serbs is apparently fine here on /r/Europe people upvoted that garbage even though the links didn't support the claim at all. He later edited the post after I pointed out his bullshit.

&gt;There are hardly any Bosnian users on /r/europe, the number of Serbian users is at least 10x bigger, so 'from your experience' is probably inaccurate. Thank you for your biased comment, however.

It's not usually nearly as bad from you guys as from a couple of the Kosovo guys, some of them seem to mostly post bad stuff about Serbia. 

But it's even just in comments towards Serbian posters. It may have nothing to do with the Ex-Yugo war at all but people apparently still feel the need to remind everyone that Serbians are evil, that they can't be trusted, that they're probably just Russian puppets etc. simply because they have a Serbian (or Rep. Srpska) flag. 

&gt;Yeah, mentioning war crimes and ethnic-based discrimination which continues to this day is most certainly 'anti-Serbian' /s.

Of course it is when it's constantly brought up, and usually by the same people, or at least people from the same countries. It's not like it's often relevant to bring up talks about Serbian war crimes on /r/Europe but people still do it. It's usually completely off-topic or just a whataboutism. Just to make sure that everyone remembers that Serbians are evil. Then it's clearly anti-Serbian. 

It's like someone having to mention Nazi Extermination Camps whenever a German posts something that has nothing to do with WWII at all. Obviously that would be a clear sign that the person was anti-German, otherwise there'd be no reason to bring up irrelevant shit like that on a regular basis.

Or imagine someone regularly pointing out horror stories about people like Azra Bašić and their actions in the war, whenever you posted about something completely different. Just to remind everyone that Bosnians have done some horrifying shit even though it's completely off-topic. Would you not see that as someone clearly having an anti-Bosnian agenda?

For example, let's say you an I are having a discussion about.. Ohh I dunno.. Criminals and prison sentences and you arguing for countries to be stricter on criminals. Then imagine someone posting something like ""Well, you didn't feel that way when it came to your war criminals, did you? Hypocrite!"" or ""I guess you think we should torture them like Azra Bašić did, huh?""

*Clearly* they'd be doing that as way to silence you or Bosnians in general. What other reason could there be? It's completely irrelevant to our talk about prison sentences but they still felt the need to bring it up. That's what I'm tired of people doing to Serbs/Serbians.

&gt;Wait, what? Go to any thread related to Bosnia in the last year and you'll see tens or hundreds of comments from Serbian flairs calling Bosniaks 'Muslim Serbs' and saying the country should be split up, etc...

Really? Maybe they've been downvoted to shit then or even deleted? I don't remember noticing such a trend at least. The anti-Serbian stuff generally isn't downvoted though. That's the fucking problem. If it was just a single nutter believing something that wouldn't really affect anything much, but the garbage gets upvoted.

&gt;Fascinating, mind giving an example?

""You guys"" meaning Ex-Yugo folks in general. You guys (from all ""sides"") spend so much fucking time and effort arguing, posting shit about the others etc. I'm sure you'd agree that Serbians do it since you seem to have a problem with them, but you also see it from other sides. You also see people from one side trying to downplay their own sides evil when the Ex-Yugo war is discussed which is equally disgusting no matter which side is doing it. Everyone knows that Serbia did some evil shit and that people have been punished for some horrific shit, but what the other sides did wasn't any less bad, there were just fewer cases of it. ""Serbia started it."" seems to be enough of an excuse for the other sides which I find disgusting. Torture, ethnic cleansing, killing civilians etc. is *never* okay no matter who does it. 


The difference from /r/Europe 's side is that most garbage from the Serbian side tends to be downvoted, unless it's something current and obviously stupid (ie. what's going on with Kosovo and their 100% tax etc).

2. Even if the EU did create a real army, if you actually listen to anything that the French president and other Eurofederalists say, it's seem they want an Eu army specifically for the purpose of disentangling form the USA. Which in of itself would undermine NATO. 

NATO does not operate very often. But when it does operate it has a clear chain of command which the US runs.

4990,"Without meaning to be rude, you're being a little naive with that comparison. Languages obviously have considerably more historical and cultural significance than certain knowledge-based skills like computer use. What language you speak helps define who you are as distinct from others, and while this is a huge administrative pain when working internationally, many people justifiably take pride in their own language to the exclusion of others, and it lacks common sense to suggest that people would not be considerably more apprehensive over such a move. 

&amp;#x200B;

In practice, making Esperanto an official EU language requires either one of two things. 1) Everyone in every EU country learns and uses Esperanto; or 2) All EU officials learn and use Esperanto. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 is unrealistic and completely distinct from learning how to use a computer. If I learn how to use a computer at work, that skill is broadly transferable (I can now use my home computer more effectively) but is limited and does not infringe on any particular cultural or historical issues. Learning a new language for work is not - I am extremely unlikely to have others outside of my job learn the language with me, even if I could make them do so. If I'm forced to use a new language at work, either I will not learn it effectively because I will use other languages the moment I leave work, or I will suffer socially for my use of a language that those outside of my work do not use, and will, at worst, leave my job or, at best, be unhappy and lobby for a return to the use of my native language. 

&amp;#x200B;

1 is also unrealistic. The EU in no small part celebrates the diversity of peoples and cultures within it  - look at Eurovision. The idea that it would advocate for supplanting those languages with another language without the same cultural foundations is laughable. No one is going to learn this language just because it makes administration easier. Yes computers make life more efficient, but their efficiency alone did not make computers catch on as they have. It was a complex mix of efficiency, the social and economic advantages that efficiency brought, complex networking and status effects, etc. Technology was also adjacent to culture for most of it's being - learning to use your computer did not come at the expense of using your car, in the way that learning a new language would come at the expense of your old language. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying that it wouldn't be great if everyone used the same language to communicate, or that Esperanto isn't a good candidate for a universal language. Those may well both be true. But the particular question OP raised - ""Why hasn't Esperanto been considered as an official EU language"" - is distinct from both of those questions, and has an extremely simple answer - because the amount of people in the EU who speak it is negligible. If you would like to speculate about how it would be great if everyone *did* speak Esperanto - great! By all means have at. But that isn't what I was getting at, and the tone of your response seems to presuppose some of that speculation.",,/r/europe/comments/a0ervc/why_hasnt_the_eu_adopted_esperanto_as_an_official/eahaom9/,Holy_Roaming_Emperor,1543201263

No it wasn't. Some people in Britain thought so, but not Chamberlain, who thought that Hitler would be keep the deal. And not ministry of foreign affairs, which was strongly against this.

Generally, a lot of politicians thought about Germany as potential ally (buffer, if you want) against Soviet Union, which was THE enemy with its revolutionary ideology that endangered political stability of many western nations.

5175,"The Nazis did have a considerably strong left-wing, as you already explained. But as other eternal fascist ideologies (besides Franquismo and the others) it obviously leaned heavily on a vast amount of different ideologies.
In fact in the early years, Röhm being the most famous one, many prominent members of the NSDAP had this belief, which wasn't willfully querfront in the slightest. 

The SA had massively revolutionary leftist tendencies. Look at their hymn, ""Rotfront und Reaktion"", the intention was quite clear. Hitler managed to co-opt this leftist elements even way after Röhm and the others had been long eliminated. So the movement from a somewhat socialist movement to a right-wing party can be observed by following the SA's influence, and latter replacement by the SS. 
That the Nationalsozialisten had been highly criticised even in their times is not new, at all. That's also one of the reasons why they were called Nazis by their critics in the first place. It was a tongue in cheek reference to the socialdemocrats, who are actually still called Sozis. 
Look at the internal documents on the relationship between NSDAP and the DNVP. Nazism and fascism in general tend to use a lot of elements, as ""terza via"" generally implies. Ezra Pound's work is probably the most noted example of this belief in sindacalism and esoteric nationalism outside of Italy and Germany. It is a fluid system that relies on different approaches and lies to continue its existence. Baumann might even call this some form of liquid society on a political level. 

Or to put it in Mussolini's words:

5193,"&gt; The reason why Nazis were super bad was that they, as the ruling party of Germany, had pretty much no compunctions or scruples about committing war crimes. How could they, since they viewed the victims as subhuman? That, if anything, is the real horror of the Nazi regime - the refusal to acknowledge the humanity of their victims.

Explain in detail how that is different from all the other cases of demonization and inhumanity throughout history such as american treatment of blacks, belgian treatment of congolese, british treatment of indians... roman treatment of gauls. I could go on forever. 

There are no good wars. Soldiers are trained murderers. There are no morals in nations' leading echelons. Just interests. Empires are nothing more than ""the best murderers with the best weapons"" contest winners. Humans and nature itself is violent by default. 

The only reason nazis are ""super bad"" was 

1. because they lost and had to eat all the propaganda against them 

2. their loss was recent and memories from the victims still fresh

As someone with an interest in history I'd classify nazis as symptomatic of the era, the deterministic result of the mid-century zeitgeist and not nearly the worst thing to have existed in the XXth century.

As bad as the nazi leaders were, their interviews indicate overall awareness of their system and approaches.

5307,"&gt;Care to respond to the first part? How is Kosovo’s Independence any less legitimate than any so called “kraijna”? Why should they be denied but Serbs be given rights they never had? Kosovo had regional autonomy in Yugoslavia , almost like a republic but there never was a Kraijna. Serbs tend to cry over Kraijna yet would not want an independent Kosovo, at least be consistent. 

It's not. If Krajina got independence I'd be fine with Kosovo getting it too, but since Krajina and RS were denied it Kosovo too should be denied. Kosovo getting independence and RSK and RS not getting it is inconsistent.

&gt;I am Croatian and if not for the war and if Yugoslavia could have split peacefully and without Serb oppression of Kosovo Albanians I don’t think there would be many Croats who would want to see an independent Kosovo. Nor would there be international recognition of it. Serbs need to realize that their own deluded ambitions are what has cost them dearly. 

Sure, our actions did cost us a lot, but let's not pretend it was purely down to them on their own. Simply put those actions went against the interests of the West, which at the time, with the fall of the USSR was the only global power remaining. Y

But hey, if we wanna talk about peaceful splits, sure, if we didn't do anything and let the republics go just so it could've split peacefully, but likewise if Croatia and Bosnia let their Serbs go peacefully war could've been avoided too and Kosovo's independence wouldn't have such strong opposition.

I'd also argue that Islam had far greater influence over Middle Eastern culture. I don't think there are many Byzantine influences outside of architecture and over material culture. Meanwhile, Eastern Europe (or, more precisely, Orthodox Cristian Europe) had more non-material influence because of religion.

5333,"&gt; You must be joking. Greece's both historical diplomatic relationship with Russia is much better than that of Turkey. Both the Russian and Turkish governments know that the honeymoon won't last and you can tell by their actions.

Totally different story and countries, also, lately (time is important) greece has very bad diplomatic ties with russia, unlike turkey who is getting close. the honey moon you are talking about is becoming permanent depending on turkeys decisions. but also, if some journalists around here are correct, the damage turkey inflicted to their relationship with us and the countries differences are deep enough to never recover. so...

&gt; About 500 soldiers, to prevent SA from basically taking the country over. It's a way of keeping SA dominance of the Gulf at bay while giving Iran some little breathing room politically, in recognition of the Isreali and revived American campaign to mess with it.

Long story short, Turkey is trying to become the regulator of the middle east. So, why you disagree with me on this? You object jsut to object sometimes.

&gt; An immensely complicated affair. Let's just say that Isreal, the US, Iran, Egypt etc all had on-and-off relationships with MB. They're pretty much irrelevant now and likely in major decline. If you actually want to talk about MB, do it properly.

As far as i know, they way erdogan waves his hands to the crowd before he talks, at least sometimes i cant tell for every public speech he has in turkey, IS a mb symbol, look at his thumb sometimes.

Since then I’ve drunk thousands of Czech and German beers and struggled to find a good German beer in comparison to the Czech stuff.

I asked this girl about a year ago what I had to do to find this mythical German beer which is better than Czech beer. She said that she was wrong and she thought Czech beer is better than German beer. Sigh.

For me it comes down to going into a normal pub and buying a normal light lagered beer. If it’s a reasonable price and tastes good it’s a winner. In my experience it’s much easier to get a good beer this way in the Czech Republic than in Germany. That’s it for me. Any brewer can make an “interesting” pineapple and sour orange IPA by adding “interesting” and unusual ingredients. Not every brewer can make a great light lagered beer with hops, malt, yeast and water.

&gt;In classical antiquity, Anatolia was described by [Herodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus) and later historians as divided into regions named after tribes such as [Lydia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia), [Lycia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycia), [Caria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caria), [Mysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysia), [Bithynia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bithynia), [Phrygia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygia), [Galatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatia), [Lycaonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycaonia), [Pisidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisidia), [Paphlagonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paphlagonia), [Cilicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilicia), and [Cappadocia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia). By that time, the populations were a mixture of the ancient Anatolian or ""[Syro-Hittite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syro-Hittite)"" substrate and post-Bronze-Age-collapse ""Thraco-Phrygian"" and more recent Greco-Macedonian incursions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Anatolia is known as the birthplace of minted [coinage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin) (as opposed to unminted coinage, which first appears in [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia) at a much earlier date) as a medium of exchange, some time in the 7th century BC in Lydia. The use of minted coins continued to flourish during the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period) and [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire) eras.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia#cite_note-28)[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia#cite_note-29)  
&gt;  
&gt;During the 6th century BC, all of Anatolia was conquered by the [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia) [Achaemenid Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire), the Persians having usurped the [Medes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medes) as the dominant dynasty in [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran). In 499 BC, the Ionian city-states on the west coast of Anatolia rebelled against Persian rule. The [Ionian Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Revolt), as it became known, though quelled, initiated the [Greco-Persian Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars), which ended in a Greek victory in 449 BC, and the Ionian cities regained their independence, alongside the withdrawal of the Persian forces from their European territories.  
&gt;  
&gt;**In 334 BC, the** [**Macedonian**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom)) **Greek king** [**Alexander the Great**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great) **conquered the peninsula from the Achaemenid Persian Empire.**[**\[30\]**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia#cite_note-30)**Alexander's conquest opened up the interior of Asia Minor to Greek settlement and influence.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Following the death of Alexander and the breakup of his empire, Anatolia was ruled by a series of Hellenistic kingdoms, such as the** [**Attalids of Pergamum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attalid_dynasty) **and the** [**Seleucids**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucids)**, the latter controlling most of Anatolia. A period of peaceful** [**Hellenization**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenization) **followed, such that the local Anatolian languages had been supplanted by Greek by the 1st century BC. In 133 BC the last Attalid king bequeathed his kingdom to the** [**Roman Republic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic)**, and western and central Anatolia came under** [**Roman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic) **control, but** [**Hellenistic culture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_culture) **remained predominant.** Further annexations by Rome, in particular of the [Kingdom of Pontus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Pontus) by [Pompey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompey), brought all of Anatolia under Roman control, except for the eastern frontier with the [Parthian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire), which remained unstable for centuries, causing a series of wars, culminating in the [Roman-Parthian Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman-Parthian_Wars).  
&gt;  
&gt;Early Christian period  
&gt;  
&gt;**After the division of the Roman Empire, Anatolia became part of the East Roman, or** [**Byzantine Empire**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire)**. Anatolia was one of the first places where Christianity spread, so that by the 4th century AD, western and central Anatolia were overwhelmingly Christian and Greek-speaking. For the next 600 years, while Imperial possessions in Europe were subjected to barbarian invasions, Anatolia would be the center of the Hellenic world.** Byzantine control was challenged by [Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs) raids starting in the eighth century (see [Arab–Byzantine wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Byzantine_wars)), but in the ninth and tenth century a resurgent Byzantine Empire regained its lost territories, including even long lost territory such as [Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia)and [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria) (ancient [Aram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aram_(biblical_region))).

5412,"Man I really don't wish to do this.

How do I put this, my dad was in the military, and took part in war with Croatia, Kosovo and later Nato bombing. 

It's such a hard thing to discuss with anyone who hasn't lived here.

I'll try to be very neutral, while presenting what I know are facts, not what most people believe at least. 

Croatian war was us supposedly genociding everyone. At the time my dad was stationed in Croatia. The moment news broke through he hid my mom (Croatian girl btw) under the bed and got beated and fucked up by his Croatian neighbours. For being Serbian. Luck had it they didn't shoot him, they had guns. My mom to this day is called ""Chetnik Kurva"" for leaving with him. Had you only heared this you'd say Croatians just waited for a reason to fight Serbs.

Why am I mentioning this? Because it is a fact similar things happened on Kosovo and we only knew of those cases. I am not ever going to go into who started it, as you know there are 2 sides to the story and truth is in the middle. 

What were we told? That Shqiptars are killing our civilians (there were killed civilians before everything went down, especially kids). What we weren't told was that our paramilitary, and unfortunately our police officers were looting Albanian homes. One lives near me and to this day brags how he went into Albanian home and raped a 15 year old girl. I will quote him ""I raped that tight whore pussy and stole all their possessions. I did it to others too, that's why today I am a powerful man""

So we had one side, not the other. More shit went down, more extremists on both sides started killing until Serbian military went in to defend our citizens. THis was all we knew at the time. And unfortunately my dad was there again. He was so afraid of Albanians he had granade ready to blow himself up rather than get tortured and his organs sold. 

How much of that is true, I don't know. It's disgusting to think about either way. 

Lets circle back to this cop I mentioned I know. He openly talks about it, and he is a free man. Serbian people fear such men just as much as do Albanians. That person is not sane, as no one does that, war or not. 

Also, Milosevic kept lying to us even after bombing, lying so much he tried fixing elections and finally people had it. 

As for why bombing hurts? The same way shit in Syria, Lybia and so  on. It was a civil war, NATO had no right to intervene, as it has no right to intervene in the Middle East. Hell, the fact UN didn't allow it is the proof how divided world was about it, and retracted statements and apologies show that. 

Also, remember, Ethnic cleansing was never proven and according to everywhere you look there was no ethnic cleansing. It's one side of the story, and Serbian side is preventing ethnic cleansing of Serbs. 

But lets say, we did try to cleanse Albanians, when you bomb a country, you don't bomb a bridge, a hospital, a flee market. Even fuckign Chinese Embassy. With cluster munitin.... Bombs that are made to delete as much population as possible. 

Serbia will never forget Ljiljana Spasic, who went to a flee market to buy fruit, and shrapnel hit her.

Or Milica Rakic. 

Even if we tried cleansing Albanians, these people did not. Especially not a child on a potty.

5425,"&gt; He was a far-right rival for the previous regime and his published book triggered a political crisis when then caused pent-up left-wing regime critics and dissidents to rise up in turn.

That's simply wrong.  Spinola was the man who challenged Portugal's dictator with regards to the ongoing war in the portuguese Guinea, pushing for a political solution instead of a never-ending proxy war with the soviet-backed dictatorship in neighboring Guinea.

The political solution that Spinola argued for involved a transition to a democratic regime in the whole portuguese empire and afterwards follow France's example and hold independence referendums in all overseas provinces, with IIRC the exception of portuguese Guinea which would be recognized a sovereign nation immediately. 

It's absurd to insinuate that Spinola represented any ""far-right"" movement that wasn't supported by the armed forces movement as the armed forces movement itself appointed Spinola as the president of the national salvation junta, and the symbol of the carnation revolution, captain Salgueiro Maia, personally and unequivocally supported Spinola as the movement's leader.

&gt; Now you're outright lying. Does nobody read? I'll cite the Wikipedia page again.

That's shear idiocy.  The Estado Novo regime was a totalitarian dictatorship but politically was never fascist.  In fact, the Estado Novo regime actually opposed and persecuted fascist movements who tried to establish themselves in Portugal, just like they persecuted communist movements.

This is the fiction that Google have sold to you.

Air travel is indeed an awfull polluter on a per-passenger basis. Its overall share in the emissions of the transports sector is, however, marginal.

Now, the fact that fuel for planes and ships is not taxed is more due to the fact that legally, this fuel is *exported*. Taxing it is not something the French parliament could do on its own, it is something to be negociated in the context of GATT and WTO.

&gt;Also train lines where cut to a third during the last ...

... century, thanks to the ubiquity of the automobile.

See also our zero-emission high-speed trains that do displace cars and planes.

Starting in the 1990s, see also the revival of atomic tramways in almost every major French city.

&gt;in his previous tenure as minister, Macron actually created very polluting bus lines using the same kind of fuel to replace train lines

This, indeed, is questionable, and I, for one, am not happy about it. It *could* be argued that this benefited people who otherwise would have driven their cars but I wonder if the carbon balance was ever computed. However, I am not sure that this *replaced* train lines, nor that it took market shares from train, but I would guess it did participate in the observed overall diminution of the number of passenger.kilometers traveled by car, althoug I've never seen those figures either.

I'll choose the first one.

You're only seeing the negatives, you're not noticing that most of the rights we have today weren't given to us by our leaders, we had to fight for them, we did, and we won. Our president is elected directly because of a fight, our leaders refused us that right for more than a century. We have two chambers of Parliament because of a fight. We have social security because of a crap ton of fights. We had to block the entire economy for weeks to keep it in the 90s.

5452,"&gt;So you're saying an immigrant from a third world country is more qualified and educated than an Eastern European? 

Nope, I didn't even imply it. 

I see you are someone who is used to just spouting whatever you have learnt off and not actually engaging with anyone challenging the ridiculous straw men you keep frantically putting up.

&gt;and yet you're the only country that complains about Eastern Europeans more than about muslims for example

&gt;Africans jumping fences and arriving by boats are seen as less of a threat than the temper tantrum the UK throws about Poles for example

It just gets cheaper and more divorced from reality the longer you give your take on it. 

Anyway, enjoy being a citizen of the earth, or whatever that meme flair is supposed to be, and continue not bothering to even listen to the basic position of British Euroscepticism.

5477,"I think you guys are idealizing the French system a bit too much.

One of the reason we protest so much, and we have these good workers rights, I'd wager to say, is because our employers suck. No, really, I mean it, there is a culture, among management and enterprise owners, of fucking over people. If you let them have it their way, they will absolutely fuck you up.

French management is always seeking to fuck the workers up to the fullest extent permitted by the law. Hence the need for strong laws. Somehow, it seems to me this is not true (at least not to the same extent) in many European countries. The difference with, say, Germany, is staggering. For example, it seems German companies are fully aware that if you want skilled, experienced, workers, you need to do your share in training them and offering beginners a chance to become experienced. In France, much less so, companies want workers who are fully skilled and experienced on the day they're born. So we end up having laws to create strict boundaries on what's acceptable or not regarding internships, so that young people can find internships, without it being ""just like a normal job, for which you have to be fully qualified btw, except we don't have to pay you"". Because we used to not have such a law, and it's always how it ended up. And somehow it still happens actually, albeit to a lesser extent.

That's just one example, but similar examples could be given about how people are hired, how they are fired, about the expectation in their daily tasks at work, about teleworking, etc.

From what I could gather about other countries in Europe, much the same applies everywhere else, but French companies pull all kind of shit to a much higher degree, *unless prevented by the law*. To the point where we have a saying about having ""le patronat le plus bête du monde"" (""stupidest top management in the world""). Hence a particularly protective set of laws. Because we need it just to be on par with the rest of the continent in terms of how employees are treated.",,/r/europe/comments/a01ef8/champsélysées_paris_this_afternoon_2411/eafvfwm/,JeSuisLaPenseeUnique,1543163656

So then the question is: if Finland isn’t able to affect cultural, social, and legal change outside Finland, should it care about what happens outside Finland? Personally, I don’t think so. Why get upset about thing we can’t change? Moreover, why get upset about something which amounts to cultural *difference*? Isn’t it the height of ethnocentrism to believe that we are *better* than those dirty Africans? Surely we should respect their decisions and wishes?

Finally, if we accept the above two, then we have to ask how it benefits Finland to allow people in with vastly different social views. I don’t think it does.

5516,"**Belgium**

News of the week: Big political crisis about the [Global Compact for Migration] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Compact_for_Migration). Some analysts think the government may fall over it.

* Like I already mentioned [two weeks ago] (https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/9w2gpy/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20181111/e9hix0k/), there's a schism in [our federal government] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Government) over the issue. [MR] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouvement_R%C3%A9formateur), [CD&amp;V] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christen-Democratisch_en_Vlaams) and [Open Vld] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Vlaamse_Liberalen_en_Democraten) are in favour, [N-VA] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Flemish_Alliance) is against. But while two weeks ago N-VA merely had some difficulties with a few aspects of it, their opposition has now evolved into the treaty being incompatible with their program and they refuse to sign it.
* Prime minister [Charles Michel] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Michel) (MR) promised to sign the treaty during a speech for the General Assembly of the UN in September, and he doesn't plan to break his promise. He feels strenghtened by the support of French president Emmanuel Macron, who paid a state visit to Belgium this week.
* So now we have two sides who have entrenched themselves so hard in their position that neither of them can compromise without losing face. And that on a polarising issue like migration, seven months before [the elections] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_federal_election,_2019).

Other news of the week: The French *[gilets jaunes] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilets_jaunes_protests)* protests spilled over into Belgium. 

* The protests are almost exclusively contained in Wallonia. There are logical reasons for this; Walloons are poorer, live more spread out (and thus need their car more often), often drive older diesel cars and don't have as many company cars (where the employer pays the fuel) as the Flemish, so they're hit harder by rising diesel prices. But that doesn't explain the whole story. Many analysts point out that many Walloons watch French tv and follow French media, which would've inspired the Walloons to protest as well.
* The protests turned violent near the fuel depot of Feluy, in [Hainaut] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainaut_\(province\)). Protestors blocked the [E19 highway] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_route_E19), had violent clashes with the police and [set a fuel truck on fire] (https://www.msn.com/fr-be/video/viral/feluy-camion-citerne-en-feu/vp-BBPU2X4). They also [harassed journalists] (https://www.rtbf.be/info/medias/detail_feluy-une-journaliste-de-la-rtbf-agressee-par-des-gilets-jaunes-mardi-en-fin-de-soiree?id=10078323) of the Frenchspeaking public broadcaster [RTBF] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTBF), their van was hit with rocks, a cameraman got injured when he was beaten with batons. The rioters had to be removed with a water cannon.

* Politicians condemned the violence, but also claimed to understand the grievances of the protestors.

In other news: 

* Elections coming soon also means politicians retiring. And that means of course controversy about their very high retirement fees, which can go up to 400k euros for long serving politicians. The politicians in question waved away the criticism as populism.
* There's a breakthrough in the coalition negotiations in [Antwerp] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp). The N-VA of incumbent mayor [Bart De Wever] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_De_Wever) will try to form a coalition with Open Vld and [sp.a] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialistische_Partij_Anders). This is remarkable because De Wever has criticised the sp.a a lot and it was his N-VA that removed the social democrats from the Antwerp city council six years ago, after they've been in the majority for over 80 years. Above that, De Wever's current centre right coalition of N-VA, CD&amp;V and Open Vld kept its majority. But with only one seat spare, De Wever wanted to expand his coalition to the left for stability, and when the [green party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groen_\(political_party\)) refused, he took the sp.a on board. Now it's the CD&amp;V who's kicked out... after having been in the majority for over 80 years.
* Speaking about CD&amp;V Antwerp, their leader [Kris Peeters] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Peeters) (also currently Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Employment) will now lead the European list of CD&amp;V for the elections in 2019. It's seen as an elegant exit for the former political heavyweight, now that he's burned his carreer with his big loss in Antwerp a few weeks ago. 
* Flemish transport company [De Lijn] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Lijn) will remove their stops from the [Brussels-North railway station] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels-North_railway_station).

I copied a few paragraphs (and modified them a bit), but do check out the original article as well:

&gt;**Immigration**

&gt;EU citizens and their families will be able to move to live and work in the UK (and vice versa) until the end of the transition period in December 2020. 

&gt;Those who take up residence before that date will be allowed to remain beyond transition. 

&gt;Also, beyond 2020 the EU and UK will try to achieve visa-free travel for short-term visits.


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**European Court of Justice (""ECJ"")**

&gt;Until December 2020, ECJ has jurisdiction in the UK. If no deal is reached, a co-called ""back stop"" arrangement comes into effect, meaning there will be arbitration, but law interpretation still falls to the ECJ.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Trade**

&gt;Until December 2020, things will remain the same. If no deal is reach until then, the back-stop plan: UK will remain in customs union with the EU (so same as now). But this would mean the UK wouldn't be able to negotiate separate trade deals. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Irish border**

&gt;Until December 2020, things will remain the same. If no deal is reach until then, the back-stop plan: Some goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would be subject to new checks and controls (such checks would always be carried out by UK authorities). However, goods going in the other direction, from Northern Ireland into the rest of the UK, would not be subject to new controls.

5532,"&gt;Viktor Orban is the prime minister of Hungary. He's an enormous thorn in the body politic of the EU. He practises what his followers like to call ""illiberal democracy.""

No, is what his opponents like to call it like that.

And examples from Czechia and Slovakia would be? One of two being eurozone member that participated on bail-out program of nationas that each and everyone were richer than itself?

Oh, right, you mean quotas. That are currently also opposed by Austria or Italy. How long do you intend to milk that dead topic? Until only Spain and Germany are the ones which propose it?

&gt;Orban's latest low blow is his decision to offer political asylum to an old friend, Nikola Gruevski. Gruevski is the former prime minister of the small Balkan country of Macedonia, once a part of Yugoslavia. He's also a convicted criminal, found guilty of corruption while prime minister and given a two-year prison sentence.

Yes, that was an idiotic move and all neighbouring countries should issue an order to police forces that if Gruevski crosses to their territory he will be arrested immidiatelly. Also, if he appears on flight list of airline going through their airspace, the plane should be brought down and Gruevski arrested.

5535,"Yes, it has  largely been irrelevant which of the two parties are ""in charge"" since they've operated as a uni-party, they play the population up against each other, but the political outcome is basically the same. This is however not limited to the US. It has been the same all over the west. Politicians seem to have a common long term goal, which seems to be globalism. No matter who has been in charge the movement towards that goal has been more or less constant.  Which is why we today have a strong populist movement. 

Obama was probably the first populist response to this. In 2008 he ran as a populist with the slogans ""Hope"" and ""Change"". When he came to power however he became a crony just like the rest of them. 

The next populist movement was the Tea Party movement within the GOP, this was a movement that gave GOP both houses in Congress, and then that movement was quelled as well. The IRS was used to destroy the movement. The GOP blamed Obama for this, but we now know that John McCain (Warmonger-in-Chief, may he burn in hell a few years more), was part of this as well. 

This is the same McCain that rode the Tea Party wave on repealing Obamacare, but then when he had the chance to do so, voted against it. 

This tool was not only used against the Tea Party, but also against progressive movements within the DNC.

Trump is the second insurrection from the grass roots of the GOP, and this time there is still hope. 

There is now also a second insurrection within the DNC with people like Ocasio-Cortez and the ""Justice Democrats"", this movement however seems to be facing the same end as the Tea Party movement did. The DNC establishment rode the populist-progressive agenda to ""victory"", but are now reaffirming their control over the party. 

Yes, the US is still selling arms to the Saudis, but Trump is honest about why they are doing so (it's the oil).  EU-members were selling weapons to the Saudis as well. It's less than two months since Germany signed off on a large weapons sale to Saudi/Jordanian governments, and they only stopped doing so after Saudi Arabia killed a journalist.

So:

Killing a bunch of civilians -&gt; Sure we'll sell you weapons to do that.
Killing one journalist -&gt; Oh we better stop selling weapons to you. 

The EU is also looking to ""normalize ties"" with the other side of that conflict (Iran).

""American warmongering"" is too narrow, it's Western warmongering"". Europe does not have a ""refugee-crisis"", it has a ""migrant-crisis"", Libya and Syria is at the core of that crisis, and the EU is just as responsible as the US for the issues in those two countries.  


(edit: Rewrite the next paragraph to clarify)
Trump is absolutely undoing the sources of the populism.  He is not expanding his own executive power. He is simply trying to fix the issues that are feeding the populist movement while staying within tighter restrictions than his two predecessors gave themselves. Trump is in effect actually reducing the executing power of the president by not expanding the use of it the way Bush and Obama did.

As far as I can tell there are primarily two sources for the current wave of populism. The economy and the mass migration. Trump is no using these issues to gather more power, he is simply exercising the power the president already has to try and tackle both of these issues. 

The best example is probably to look at how Trump and Obama try and tackle illegal immigration. 

 - Obama introduced DACA through an executive order, after repeatedly saying that he couldn't do that as a president. 
 - Obama also loosened the control over the border, which increased the problems.
 - Trump nullified the executive order, and told Congress to get off its ass and fix the problem.
 - Trump is trying to take back control over the border.

Yes fear mongering is one of the oldest tactics for authoritarians. Create a problem, then point to that problem and say ""I can fix this, but you need to give me more power to do so"". Who is doing that today? It's not Trump, it the EU. 

2020 will be a very interesting election, it seems to me that Clinton is now gathering power for one last attempt at winning back the White House, both she and Kerry spoke out about the problems of mass migration in Europe in the last week or so, so she might be gearing up to run on a platform more along the DNC had 15-20 years ago. 

If she wins that election I think the war is over and the west is lost for several generations.

5571,"&gt;Mainly, I've not really seen much negative press, if any, on Macron. I assumed he had a broad base of support

Press and media are ruled by what we call the System, which used massive media-propaganda to place Macron as Puppet-President (who then passed laws in favor of the System in return). Macron never had a broad base of support, not even during the French Presidential Elections. Considering only the 18+ years old people living in France, in 2017 :

* 83% of the French People didn't vote Macron on the first stage of the two-turns voting-system ;
* 39,81% voted neither Macron or Le Pen on the second stage ;
* 39,79% voted Macron on the second stage, most of them in fear of Le Pen ;
* 20,4% still voted Le Pen on the second stage.

The whole electoral system is a democratic hold-up, ruled by the System, and our main media are only a Propagandastaffel.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The article mentioned the initial anti-Macron-tinged protest of a new  gas(petrol) tax that had 300,000 participants. That's a really massive  protest; how significant was the tax hike?

There had been much more participants than what was announced, but the media relayed System propaganda to minimize and reduce the importance of the protest. Source : many of my friends are gendarmerie and police officers, and they all said they were overwhelmed and that there must had been at least 10 times more than officially announced.

And it is not solely a fuel price increase problem, but a constant and massive  tax increase during the last past decades, and the fact that politicals don't seem to live  on the same planet (earning 20 times more than the average worker, all  leaving in Paris, all multiculturalists, voting their own salary  increase while at the same time they ask people to make still more  efforts and pay more tax, etc.), and are spending their time lying and  insulting French people, their heritage and their traditions.

This tax increase could be like the straw that breaks the camel, and the System still works hard to make people think it is not.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And how big of a deal is an increase in fuel taxes?

My girlfriend is earning 800 € a month (working 24 hours a week, 2 or 3 times a day) in a cafeteria. She already had to pay around 200 € of fuel each month just to go to work, is now paying 230 €, and soon will be paying 250\~300 €. She also have to pay her housing rent 400 € (once deducted 200 € of social support), and 150 € of bills (gas, electricity, water, phone, internet, and yet she take really care and consumes little and does not even heat up her house yet). She had 50 € left for the maintenance and insurance of her car, and to buy food. And now have much more less, and soon nothing left to eat…

Fortunately, she can eat one meal a day for free in the restaurant she works for, but many don't even have that chance. French train and public transports are totally worthless (and costly) outside big cities.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What do you think will be the end result of these protests? Macron's approval is already in the toilet

The  politico-media system is already working hard to minimize and dilute the  importance of the movement, to undermine the motivations.

Most videos that yellow jackets are posting on Facebook are not visible to their friends and contacts, as if they had not posted anything and so the movement was wiping.

Hundreds of accounts of  influential protesters have been disabled by Facebook in recent hours, and just in my entourage, I just reactivated 3 of them: my mother who was only  sharing some videos about it, my girlfriend who had posted some videos among the protestors, and a friend. This censorship is worthy of a dictatorship.

During  the yesterday protests on the Champs-Elysees, the [CRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compagnies_R%C3%A9publicaines_de_S%C3%A9curit%C3%A9) gassed with lacrimogens yellow jackets that were demonstrating peacefully, while in the same time they did nothing against the scums who then began to break and burn everything.

There are videos of yellow jackets that went to warn the police that about twenty young scoundrels broke and burned everything, and the police laughed and did nothing.

Later, in the early evening, the police charged the yellow jackets, followed by a large convoy of vehicles, which emptied the Champs-Élysées of most of the Yellow Jackets. Then in their place came breakers having nothing to do with the movement, without the police doing anything against them. And as expected, the media today only speak about the damage allegedly being done by the yellow jackets, insisting that the costs will be borne by the taxpayers.

The media also interview anyone except the concerned yellow jackets, including political figures taken out of the closet, and questions about the protests diverge quickly to things that have nothing to share (Ségolène Royal who was interviewed one wonders why, and with whom the subject quickly deviated from yellow jackets to women's rights).

There is an incredible and formidable propaganda machine currently at work.

Unfortunately, I am not sure that people are still sufficiently weak and poor and angered to ignore propaganda and to continue their legitimate revolt.

But who knows? I hope that this popular and apolitical movement will continue to grow in spite of everything, in particular because it is totally legitimate and well-founded, and I hope that it will be able to free France from the mafia that has seized power for decades.

Our ancestors did a Revolution to drive out the aristocracy, and the bourgeois took the opportunity to take their place and are now even worse.

1/4 of the deaths mentioned were inflicted by coalition forces, let's say 170,000, or 0.6% of the Iraqi population (baring in mind that number is not only civilians according to your source).

&gt; There was an attempted far-right coup on 11 March 1975, which could have plunged Portugal into another 4 decades of fascist rule.

Actually, that's not true at all.  The coup attempt of March 11th 1975 was a reaction to [operation easter slaughter](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matan%C3%A7a_da_P%C3%A1scoa_(Revolu%C3%A7%C3%A3o_dos_cravos\) ), a disinformation campaign conducted by the portuguese communist party and  the Soviet Union where they disseminated a plan whose objective was to of round up all non-communist military and political leaders to be assassinated in order to subsequently install a communist dictatorship.  

The military leaders, when getting a hold of that plan, reacted with a poorly planned military coup which naturally failed, and thus were forced to flee the country.  

Consequently, the communists stepped in and started to enforce their control over the country with their ""revolutionary process in progress"" ([processo revolucionário em curso - PREC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processo_Revolucion%C3%A1rio_Em_Curso))

The ""revolutionary period in progress"" culminated with the failed military coup of November 25th 1975, where the communists failed to take over Portugal to enforce their dictatorship.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/a0806b/43_years_ago_portugal_avoided_being_forced_into_a/eafl5oc/,BugaTuga,1543156744

5653,"&gt;Its very hard to adjust output from nuclear meaning while they work great for base loads you require additional controllable sources such as coal to account for natural variability in demand. Which can be huge.

It's not difficult to adjust output from nuclear. A modern light water reactor can adjust output by 5% of maximum per minute.

The difference between nuclear and wind/solar is that nuclear only has a problem adjusting to demand, wind and solar have the same problem of adjusting to demand, but also have a problem maintaining supply.

The problem of meeting demand is likely to get easier in future as the electrification of transport and heating will even out the demand curve.

If you scale up wind/solar and nuclear to meet all UK demand, wind/solar have 2.5 times as much wasted power and 2.5 times as much undersupply. And as they are far more unpredictable, it's much harder to meet that undersupply.

With nuclear we might need 10 GW of extra power to meet the demand peak. With wind and solar we would still need 50 GW of extra power available (because both combined cannot guarantee any significant level of generation). Much of the 10 GW nuclear would need can be met by pumped and normal hydro, battery storage etc. We cannot expand those source to meet the 50 GW wind/solar would require, or rely on them to last for days or weeks during a winter wind lull.

&gt;The requirement for energy storage is systemic across the entire industry and while renewable sources do suffer more than most nuclear is not above this issue?

The evening demand peak might require 30 GWH of storage. The winter wind lull would, according to the energy research partnership, require 8 TWH of storage. 30 GWH is achievable. 8 TWH is not. 

There are still issues meeting variable demand with inflexible supply. But they aren't anything like as difficult as meeting variable demand with inflexible, intermittent supply. ",,/r/europe/comments/a06iom/margaret_thatcher_on_climate_change/eafdbug/,WhiteSatanicMills,1543149134

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently there's been a fair bit of change lately, thanks to some law suits brought about by consumer groups (cf. Which?) and a lot of the old ""guidelines"" have been put to one side.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance there's a FAQ -  **20 FAQs about unfair trading, trade descriptions and pricing**   ([source)](https://www.lawdonut.co.uk/business/marketing-and-selling/consumer-protection/unfair-trading-trade-descriptions-and-pricing-faqs)  \- which claims;

 

&gt;Broadly, any price comparisons of this kind must not be misleading. For example:  
&gt;  
&gt;to claim that products are on sale, you should show the previous price and should have been selling at that price for a meaningful period of time  
&gt;  
&gt;you must not claim a discount against the recommended retail price (RRP), if the RRP is significantly higher than the price generally charged for the product  
&gt;  
&gt;you should not claim that you are selling at an introductory price if you plan to continue selling at that price indefinitely, or to stop selling the product after the introductory period

Looking elsewhere then [this](http://marketinglaw.osborneclarke.com/advertising-regulation/no-more-28-day-rule-pricing-and-promotions-under-the-spotlight/) marketing law site claims that the new guidance, makes the following less likely to be compliant;

&gt;Price establishing for 28-days within a 6-month period so that a product is at full price for one month and then on discount for 5 months. The recommendation is to move to 1:1 pricing (i.e. the product is offered at a discount for the same period of time or shorter than the product is sold at full price).  
&gt;  
&gt;Using different reference prices in different stores but picking the highest reference price as the “was” price for a promotion running in all stores. For example, product x sold at £3 and £4 in different stores, reduced to £2 and sold at half price in all stores.  
&gt;  
&gt;Using a reference price that applied many months (at least more than 2 months) prior to the promotion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Price establishing seasonal products (e.g. Easter eggs, British strawberries) out of season to be able to show a discount when the product is in season.  
&gt;  
&gt;Using a reference price when only a minimal amount of product actually sold at that price. There is now an expectation that a business will have sold a “significant number” of units at the higher price in order to make a price comparison.

Its construction was planned before WW2, but the war and communism prevented it from being erected until now. 

Also local artists made a mural in Novi Sad a couple of weeks ago, to commemorate the Serbian Army entering the city back in 1918:

I work in the UK for the biggest retailer and we are shutting down the 24hr Massive store format bit by bit. It's just not financially worth it. 

Small stores open from 6/7am to 10-11pm are where it's at now. People want convenience more than they want to go for big shopping trips, at least here.

As you were talking about it creating jobs, it's costing jobs here as the stores are being closed down. There's more to it obviously, not all too relevant here but in the bigger picture I don't think 24hr stores are really that great.

It's fun to go shopping at 3am though and have more or less entire aisles to yourself but it's nothing that makes a difference really.


If you wanna talk about bigger differences, Germany having closed stores on Sunday is such a nuisance (at least they used to, in NRW).

5801,"&gt; You suggested that one can simply choose to not vote at all.

I said that the correct choice is not necessarily on the ballot. That is not a statement of what you ought to do.

&gt; I brought this up to emphasize that not even this detail was a success of the Nazis.

But I never cited it as one? You're literally arguing against something I've never said.

&gt; I didn't claim that the other parties were the cause for the growing economy. I simply stated the fact that this happened during the time in which those parties governed, which debunks the myth that the NSDAP was responsible for the growth. It didn't need the NSDAP and it obviously didn't need your ""SPD without austerity"" either. All it needed was for the world economy to get back on its feet without interference.

The world economy was in the shitter and global trade wasn't as important as it is today. To suggest that Germany's recovery was divorced from government policy is an invitation to the very extremists you supposedly speak against. The NSDAP (together with the establishment bureaucracy) did actually help recovery by going on a spending spree (both fiscally and by other unsavory means), aiding in the resolution of the typical Great Depression spiral of unused, unproductive capital and labor.

This is directly contradictory to the austerity policies(reminiscent of gold-standard dogma in other countries) implemented by the center which caused a deepening of the crisis. Obviously we don't have data that is as granular as our standards today but both public perception and witness accounts of the time support this description.

&gt; Don't do anything at all and you're less damage than the Soviets. That's not really a benchmark.

The Soviets were not populist. They were legit elitists, believing that an ""enlightened"" elite should govern the proletariat. No private property =/= populism.

&gt; The concept of populism isn't about political positions. It's about the way politics is conducted. Populism creates scapegoats and it uses those scapegoats to create an ""us vs. them"" mentality. The ""ordinary citizens"" vs. the Jews, refugees, foreigners, bankers, billionaires, the ""top 1%"", corporations, but most often it's simply ""the elites"". Populism also works with fear and anger. They do this by exploiting tragedies and scandals. That's at least the core of the concept.

You are engaging in this exact behavior by treating populists and those who support them as others. By your definition, Thatcher was a populist because she used nationalist sentiment, anti-union leader rhetoric (a pretty good conservative approximation for a leeching elite), staunchly anti-immigrant politics etc.

Do you think Thatcher was a populist?

&gt; Those aren't (former) radical concepts. In Germany it was Bismarck who introduced the universal health care system amongst other things and conservative Ludwig Erhard who introduced a social market economy that kept the markets in check and provided many elements of our current welfare state. Not really radicals in my book.

And yet SYRIZA has done not even these things. They actually (at the behest of their creditors) removed the _universal_ component of universal healthcare. It is no longer free at the point of service for the entire populace.

&gt; None of those terms exclude the others.

Yet you won't actually tell me why they deserve any of these terms, instead switching them around to justify each other. By what definition of extremism are you operating?

&gt; In Germany the term is used by the authorities to describe any movement that plans to dismantle the constitutional order. It can entail violence, but doesn't have to. But in the end it's subjective.

If this was 1970, Germany could have legally switched to (non-Stalinist) socialism without upending its constitutional order. Pretty much all legal opinions would have supported this view.

5804,"&gt; Delusional to think we can be independent?

In essence yes. In our time no state as small as the UK (or any other european nation) could be anywhere near truly independent. The EU is what allows the european countries to collectively be relatively independent on international matters (with initiatives like GDPR for instance) without being pushed around by China and the US.

&gt; Well nobody voted for that and we certainly voted against that in the 1 vote we were given.

No, in the long term London will feel the affects as it loses out on important business deals within European financial services in favour of the multiple small financial hubs of Frankfurt and Paris. But they'll feel it less, it's the rest of the UK that'll feel it the most when London can no longer afford to prop the rest of us up.

And what innapropriate regulations? The UK has been at the forefront of regulations, whether that be in finance, work safety or animal welfare. The UK often didn't even have to implement new regulations from the EU because we already had them or stricter ones in place. And it's those stable favourable regulations which have made London so popular for financial services, it's why we are among the lowest in traffic and workplace accidents, it's why we are the strictest country in the entire world on animal testing.

You don't need the industries to still benefit from them. The protection from the entire bloc will serve the smallest of business. If for example Estonia has just 1 small chocolate factory, then they'll feel the benefits as if they were Belgians.

Israel prevents them from having it. It denies them basic privileges that sovereign states have like setting a trading regime or internal policing or diplomatic rights etc. It prefers this status quo to the moral alternatives available;

a) Setting up a government after a successful invasion like the Allies did in Germany and attempting to regularize relations or at least have an equal party that is responsible for said people.

b) Ending the limitations placed on the people in question, that would never be permitted against a sovereign entity.

c) Claiming sovereignty over the people in question and granting them full citizenship rights, annexing the territory in the process.

EDIT: Olkiluoto 3 was also marketed as that it will bring large emission reductions starting from 2009 and help Finland reach the Kyoto protocol emission targets. It failed in these promises.

5901,"&gt; It's probable BREXIT would have never been voted in without the large scale campaign of fear-mongering and disinformation.

Nope. It would have happened irrespective of what fearmongering and disinformation was cooked up by either side. Ultimately those affected by fearmongering didn't vote or voted remain while the 'disinformation' played a legitimately tiny role in swaying people who voted Leave.

&gt; I'm sure there are a lot of people that thought it was ok to get a lesser deal, that quitting EU was worth in itself, but you forget the people that got lied to and were gullible enough to fall for it.

&gt; but you forget the people that got lied to and were gullible enough to fall for it.

A tiny, legitimately tiny number of people. It's been vastly exaggerated by Remainers with some Remainers going so far as claiming they voted Leave and saying they now regretted the decision because 'they were lied to', purely to make the counter-claim that other 'Leavers' like them must also feel the same. 

&gt; I think the current political struggle is a reflection of that.

It's this way because massive swathes of Labour/Conservative MPs refuse to honour the vote and follow what their constituency told them to do. Without the artificial 'winners bonus' system usually granted to the winning side under FPTP, the winning side was ultimately unable to actually implement what they wanted. 

&gt; They want the people support, and the BREXIT will probably not get them as much as the remain now that folks have woken up.

Not entirely sure what you're saying but again, the belief that there has been massive swathes of the UK populace who have 'woken up' to the realisation that they were being 'lied to' is simply a fantasy peddled by pro-Remain people/groups. 

Polls repeatedly show that at max there has been virtually no movement in the population, with a regular figure being 52% for Remain and 48% for Leave (it was the exact same polling figures right before the vote, go back and check). 

Remain's poll numbers are primarily held together by fear of the economic consequences of Brexit, not a deep-seated love of the EU, as well as deluded youth who are being indoctrinated by the education system (I was recently in it, I can give full testimony to this happening). 

My strong suspicion is that within the next few months as the next Italian crisis begins to unwind and the Article 13 stuff starts getting going, opinion in favour for Leave will have a noticeable uptick. The youth will see how the EU is strangling the internet with their legislation, the perception of the EU as a stable economic block will once again be realised to be folly and the age-old issues of immigration will provide the backbone to a resurgence of Brexit support.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/a02w3y/an_unexpected_new_group_brexiteers_against_brexit/eaey6qu/,GrubJin,1543127187

Legally, the EU can only negotiate trade deals with third countries, which means you have to leave first. That's what the last two years of negotiations and the current agreement is about.

After negotiating the exit, we can negotiate a trade deal, and nobody on the EU side has ever ruled that out, contrary to your lie.

And no, the EU does not ""want"" Northern Ireland, it is, quite contrary to your claims, actually insisting the GFA be upheld.

Finally, there is no FTA between Australia and the UK, so the UK is in exactly the same position towards Australia as it is towards the EU.
