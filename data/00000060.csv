69,"&gt;and existed in Ireland when they came up with Republicanism.

They fell into decline after the English conquest with some cultural effects lasting into 18th century. Republicanism started at the end of the 18th century, with liberal Protestants being inspired by American Revolution, and by that time it would be hard to argue that Ireland was tribal. Ireland was occupied by the worlds preeminent power, that went on to become the first industrial nation, and finally got its independence in the 20th century. That's not exactly Chechnya's story, to say the least.

Dudaev ""came up with republicanism"" when his compatriots weren't past the blood feud stage. ""Coming up"" with something is not hard. Lenin came up with ""fast track to Communism"", when most of his compatriots weren't past peasant stage for example. The ends result of the both ""comings up"" is well known.

&gt;If you're so obsessed with the tribes existing, 
&gt;You're giving too much attention to tribes existing by the way;

Not with tribes existing, but with tribal social norms being the cultural foundation. Clans technically still exist in Scotland too, but in the form of cosplaying enthusiasts primarily. Different cultures are at the different stages of decay of their tribal social norms, everyone had them at some point. Chechens are at best 1/4 into that path, being not that far from Pakistani Waziristan.

&gt;you can go for Albania,

North of Albania, where blood feud still exists is an underdeveloped shitshow, even by the low Albanian standards. And that's right near EU with all its cultural and economic influence.

&gt;Montenegro and whatnot as well.

'Krvna osveta' stopped in Montenegro somewhere in the 19th century. Given that they got their independence 150 years later, I totally agree that this is the standard that we can use to judge Chechen growth potential, provided that Chechnya is magically located across the pond from Italy, with Mediterranean coast, right at the EU border, and 150 years after they had eliminated most of their tribalism, they'd probably achieve the Montenegrin level of development. Montenegro is also majority Christian, why is that important see below.

&gt;You're also confusing Sufi heterodox Islam with some mainstream imperial Islam 

I'm not confusing anything. I repeatedly mentioned proselytizing and foreign influence, implying that ""Sufi heterodox Islam"" wouldn't have remained unchanged. 

Speaking of Albanians, Kosovo would be a perfect example of what would have happened(i.e. creeping whahabbization through Saudi money):

http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/world/europe/how-the-saudis-turned-kosovo-into-fertile-ground-for-isis.html

I understand that by ""Imperial Islam"" you probably meant mainstream Sunni Islam or Turkish form of it, but I just want to mention that ""Imperial Islam"" sounds tautological. Islam from its very beginnings was imperial, with Mohammad himself leading conquests. 'Caliphate' de facto means 'empire'. It's not some peacenik ""Turning the other cheek"" kind of religion.

&gt;And no, economy doesn't have a ""national character"" or anything of that kind, lol. 

It absolutely does. If it wasn't the case Zimbabwe would be as developed as the Netherlands(or developing extremely fast approaching that level). Cultural norms are extremely important for economic development.  Some cultures are more conducive to it than others. The level of individualism, nepotism, how close are friendships, the level of trust in the institutions, institutions themselves since they are cultural entities, bourgeois values etc etc,  all matter. You simply won't risk doing complex business if your ""legislators"" or ""judiciary"" or ""law enforcement"" are preoccupied with their clan interests, or their friends(your competitors) interests, or are corrupt enough to simply take your business away, because you are not influential enough in friendship or tribal network. It requires different type of morality. 

&gt;with not being Christian

I have to disagree. Fringe post-modernist views don't dominate European cultures nor the political system. We had a cultural shift towards applying the same enlightenment values on every individual that were for fought for during the French revolution and other events.
That's not post-modernism.

I agree on the other hand that many Muslim migrants come from cultures where freedom and pluralism are valued lower that religion and authority. 

A cultural shift towards making ourselves more simular to failing Muslim societies doesn't sound like a good idea. There are bad tendencies that we have to correct in our societies that have nothing to do with migration and a open society is much better suited for that then a closed one like Germany in the 60s.

Unfortunately, education is problem for 60-70 years in Turkey and undereducated, half-knowing ignorant people are in majority rn. Thats why Erdogan is still gonna get at least 40% vote in next election.

Even though people are facing with such big economic crisis, Erdogan says that fridge is a luxury and they normalize their life. They normalize the life which they cant buy red meat, they can buy fish once in a month, they cannot buy any electronic devices without 12-60 installments. 

I am a software engineer graduated from one of the best universities in Turkey with 3.5 gpa and I can only buy a rtx 2060 laptop from a cheap Turkish brand with 12 installments.  I need to buy a phone, but cannot afford to do (need to 12 installment for it too).

Unless you mean the Confederacy, you haven't seen our far-right yet. Which might be good :D

One of our far-right dudes is always greeting people by saying ""God bless"" (it's normally customary to say that to the priests), created (I think) the term ""Russian-German condominium under Jewish trusteeship"" and said he's for ""whipping the gays"".

---

They're really small through, a fringe party that barely got any seats: 11/460 in the parliament (6.81% votes). They thankfully failed to get any EU seats which would be a disaster; this is [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FU--EfPmJ0) of them (so he's not there anymore thankfully). Just imagine the guy I described earlier as an EU MEP.

And now they're fucked, possibly. Because it turns out a surprising amount of people *thought they'll focus solely on their economics stuff*. It eludes me why. Now they're pissed about the abortion thing - they were the sole party with *all of the votes* approving of sending the abortion legislation for a review to the Constitutional Tribunal - which judged it unconstitutional, which practically outlawed abortion, which caused the current protests...

The party is hilariously incoherent. They're basically an alliance of fringe far-right guys. Allied nationalists and libertarians. Their supporters always talk about the supposedly-libertarian part of it.

And libertarians... the main one is [Korwin, who I linked to before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FU--EfPmJ0). The thing is... he's not really a libertarian. I mean, he's fanatical about lowering the taxes. And ""small state"" thing. But at the same time, he's conservative. So are supporters. It's not really compatible with the ""small state"". 

He's anti-democracy, he says there was more freedom under the Soviets than now. He says China is the most free capitalist country. Oh, and he has a habit of saying outrageous shit right before the elections, like he tries to lower his support as much as possible.

It's known as ""1% protocol"". Before the most recent EU parliament elections he said that sex education is worse than ""slight pedophilia"" for example. And that ""slight pedophilia isn't harmful"" and such. I think one time it was ""There is no evidence that Hitler knew about the holocaust"".

315,"It started as a grievance vote and now evolved into clientele vote. 

Poland is basically split in two. You have the bigger cities where most young people live, where the jobs are, where everything is new thanks to foreign investment and growing middle class, people fly out to European cities for weekend breaks and connect with their friends all over the world through social media. On the other hand, you have the countryside where there are no jobs other than an assemblyman in a German-owned factory, all the young people left, the only investment is EU money-funded bullshit like outdoors gym, and the only thing to do is to watch TV or go to church (and you have to go, because otherwise ""what will the neighbors say""). 

So for years the difference in life quality was there but it was not that big. But past 2005 or so, the cities really turned on nitro mode while the countryside lagged behind. For years, people in the countryside would watch TV shows showing people in cities enjoying a more and more wealthy life, and while their own life was also better and better, it was not getting better as fast as for the others. At that time, the liberal elite had complete hegemony over the media and culture, and the liberal, globalist ideas were promoted. At that time, PiS was a radical, pro-church party with crazy conspiracy theorists running the party. Then in 2015 PiS decided to change their imagine and brand themselves as this modern, fun party that is no worse than other, liberal parties, except for one thing - they adopted this narrative that *those liberals want Poles to become Europeans and think we need to get more civilized which is not true because our values and our culture is actually superior to other ones*. This was a hit. Suddenly, a countryside man who doesn't speak languages, hasn't read a book in 10 years, and doesn't really think men should be helping women in household chores got a message: *you don't have to change, you're great the way you are, you are a role model*! Then they followed with rich social programs and they hit the jackpot because when this grievance fuel ended, now they still have this clientele fuel. 

So then you have the results like in the most recent presidential election. 70% of old, uneducated and/or poor people were pro-PiS, 70% of young, educated and/or wealthy people were anti-PiS. 

The tragedy of Poland is that because of negative demographic trends of the past 30 years, there's simply more older people than younger people. This election was the last one when there were more people aged 18-29 than people aged 70 and more. In 10 years, even if all young people were to vote for a certain candidate, if only 70% of old people vote for another candidate, the old ones will win. The only silver lining is that the generation that is aging now (45-65-year-olds) is split 50-50 and not 30-70.",,/r/europe/comments/jjm6hm/painting_of_polish_deputy_pm_after_his_call_for/gagm0u8/,szyy,1603946421
316,"France has a long history of destroying nations. Look at Algeria and other African countries which they have looted form and then to this day have treated them as inferiors. The African migrants who were brought to France for labor in 1700-1800s to this day live in ghettos outside or suburban's not because of choice but because of the cruel French system which has historically only benefitted those are white and french.

The cruelties and exploitation of western countries outweighs any crimes muslims may have done. To this say the average arab suffers due to oil wars and the quest to set up puppet government. The terrorist organizations that exist today are a by product of the wests control on the middle east. 

**Final Point:** No Muslim has the right to impose sharia law and fiqh(islamic law) in a non Muslim country. The beheading and all resulting actions due to the disrespect of Prophet Muhammad are not permissible and the right path according to Islamic Law in a non sharia country is to go to the courts or seek justice in peaceful manners. Islam teaches its followers to respect a countries laws and free speech or mannerisms.

However, what many Muslims are angry over is macron rubbing it in with posting the cartoons all over France and making it seem like some campaign  against Muslims (lockdown of mosques and other examples). Muslim scholars such as Yasir Qadhi and others have condemned the beheading and other incidents which happened.

327,"&gt; In the 70s America was very liberal and was even about to go metric system but there cane Reagan

Reagan is not given nearly enough credit, either here in the US or abroad, for the damage he did to our political system by inflaming conservatives to hate government. Most Americans simply have no idea how far to the right the country has been pulled just in the past 40 years or so, they won't even accept the basic premise that the parties' ideological positions have switched since the civil rights era when all you have to do is open wikipedia and you can literally see sitting members of government switch parties en masse.

Try telling a modern Republican that Richard Nixon won his 1972 election as a Republican with universal healthcare in his platform and that he founded the Environmental Protection Agency--arguably his platform was more progressive than Biden's is today. Or that if you picked up Barack Obama and dropped him in 1985, he'd more likely than not be a moderate Republican to very conservative Democrat ideologically. I hate being so cynical, but the Reagan right has so thoroughly brainwashed an entire generation of people into this intellectually bankrupt version of neoliberalism that can barely even be called conservative. I just don't see how we pull back from this short of straight up letting the ideology die out of the population with old age.",Paris 10eme | US Expat,/r/europe/comments/jjtukh/europe_will_defend_its_values_together_czech_pm/gagmgtf/,Gwenavere,1603946766

333,"No. The difference between Turkey and Nazi Germany is that because of socio economic conditions Germany at the time was one of the most developed and educated countries in Europe whose human capital was heavily invested in military. Simply put, every country has a certain pool of talented individuals which is proportional to level of their educational system, those talents can go into business, science or whatever. In Nazi Germany (or rather Prussia) this human capital was disproportionately invested in military which gave Germans an edge in able commanders in low to mid level. (It can be argued that Allies still had many able commanders at the top - just not that many down the ranks).

Modern day Turkey on the other hand, at least post coup, seems to prefer loyalty over ability. You can check out Iraq, any Arab country or China to learn what happens with a military where nepotism is uncontrolled. 

On top of it, Turkish military industry, while sizable for a mid sized economy, still cannot be independent. Turkish venerable drones have quite a lot of components bought from other countries. If Turkey is “misbehaving” too much it can be cut off from those supplies. Whether it can replace everything with indigenous design or not - is up to debate, but anyway it’ll take a lot of time.

Back with the restrictions placed on Wuhan, it meant that the roads in and out were blocked and public transport shut down.  Non-essential (and this was a broader definition that I see used in the US, included factories) companies were shut down.  Vehicles were banned from the city center.

I'd say that that might qualify.  I might even go a bit further and say that ""lockdown"" should have meant ""random people are not allowed outside of homes"".

But it very quickly was used to refer to other areas in China that had significantly-weaker restrictions -- it made a good headline to say ""N cities were on lockdown"".

Simple as that. Stop blaming Armenians. They’ve lived in France for centuries and fled to France because of the genocide. They are very well integrated in French society. In the Middle Ages we Armenians even had French rulers and kings. But today we have to deal with the same Grey Wolf Pan-Turk fascists our ancestors had to deal with everywhere we go.

Nah, that was us bombing it, apparently.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Monte_Cassino

&gt;On 11 February 1944, the acting commander of 4th Indian Division, Brigadier Dimoline, requested a bombing raid. Tuker reiterated again his case from a hospital bed in Caserta, where he was suffering a severe attack of a recurrent tropical fever. Freyberg transmitted his request on 12 February. The request, however, was greatly expanded by air force planners and probably supported by Eaker and Devers, who sought to use the opportunity to showcase the abilities of U.S. Army air power to support ground operations.

-

&gt;The bombing mission in the morning of 15 February 1944 involved 142 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers followed by 47 North American B-25 Mitchell and 40 Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers. In all they dropped 1,150 tons of high explosives and incendiary bombs on the abbey, reducing the entire top of Monte Cassino to a smoking mass of rubble.

Instead our current boarder is established by election, maybe turkey should try and allow regions to decide which country they belong to. We also regularly joke about Scania belonging to Denmark.

758,"&gt; Macron has a very fair point; Islam has a MAJOR issue in that it is not tolerant among a very large amount of its followers and is the only major religion with significant radical elements.

Yes and no. Macron does have a point that Islam has problems and that extremism is a serious threat. Muslims would be the last to disagree, because they received and still receive their fair share of domestic Islamic terrorism themselves. Many of them would agree that extremism is not to be tolerated. Don't forget that Islam has different branches, just like Christianity, and that they don't always treat each other nicely, just like Christianity.

The tolerance is an issue dependant on the country. Muslim countries with muslim populations and muslim governments have the right to design their society as such. You don't have to agree with it, but it's their country. Muslims abroad have to abide to whatever laws are in the country they live in and as far as I'm aware the vast majority does so. They might not always agree, but they abide by those laws. Then again, abiding the law does not necessarily have anything to do with religion as there are plenty of others who don't abide the law for various reasons.

&gt; If Erdogan lit up a building with Jesus sucking cock it would be considered weird and extremely distasteful but it would not lead to any threats of embargos or terrorism.

Just because we do not choose to threaten with embargoes over christianity does not mean that we don't pick other subjective reasons to do so. Terrorism is seperate from all of this, Islamic countries are not sending terrorists abroad to attack people. Perhaps they fund terrorism or aid it, which is a heinous act. But you can question the western world for doing the same thing as we've overthrown our fair share of governments and done absolutely despicable shit.

&gt; Islam has to come to terms with a modern society, and the rights it gives to all its citizens.

That's the point though, they don't. You, or me, or anyone else in the western world does not get to decide what muslim countries look like. We do not own the right to morale or values or any of that. Values differ between societies and it is up to the people of those societies to decide for themselves. You can disagree with them, you can denounce them, you can even try to convince them that a different approach is better. But you do not get to decide. That is something that a lot of people here do not seem to get to terms with and it is *exactly* the same thing in the muslim world and one of the factors that's leading to terrorism. People apparently just don't want to accept that other people are different and uphold different values.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/jjk8oa/france_tightens_security_facing_very_high_terror/gaf2x18/,Magnetronaap,1603916879

Russia today was actually quite good in English back when I read it. And it's government owned too.

You can already see where this is going.

Russia has oppositional, neutral and pro-govt media with transparent bias. All sides sport quite a few incredible journalists which follow respective bias and discussion works, you can confirm your own bias. Sides are very harsh in fact checking. Interviews are top notch and accept opposing opinions, mostly striving to be educated enough to counter each other. And most importantly they constantly engage in dialog and reference each other. 

With western sources everything claims complete independence and lack of bias. From there on, you should realize that's not how educated journalism should work.

You can see I praise German media in another response and that generally I think it's worth supreme praise as example. 

It doesn't actually matter if different opinion exists theoretically, true journalism must attempt to give voice to its opponents and ensure it self-checks through discussion. That's not what's going on.

&gt; [The Left (German: Die Linke, stylised as DIE LiNKE ... is a democratic socialist political party in Germany. The party was founded in 2007 as the result of the merger of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) and Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative (WASG). Through PDS, the party is the direct descendant of the Marxist-Leninist ruling party of the former East Germany (GDR), the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). ... The party is the most left-wing party of the six represented in the Bundestag. It is described as far-left by some outlets, and is considered to be left-wing populist by some researchers, but the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ... does not regard the party as extremist or a threat to democracy. However, it does monitor some of its internal factions, such as the Communist Platform and Socialist Left, on account of extremist tendencies, as do some states' constitutional authorities. ... Both media and political scientists have discussed whether The Left should be considered extremist in nature. Outlets including the BBC, The Guardian, Euronews and Der Spiegel have described the party as ""far-left"" ... the party overall represents a ""soft left-wing extremism"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_(Germany\))

Ie. not centrist/moderate.

&gt; And calling them populist seems a bit off considering that they really meant what they proclaimed and were even somewhat successfully governing Thuringia for that long.

The wiki entry then goes on to say:

&gt; [The Left has also been characterised as left-wing populist by researchers such as Cas Mudde and Tilman Mayer. Florian Hartleb states that the party is ""social-populist"". According to Frank Decker, the party during the leadership of Oskar Lafontaine could be described as left-wing populist. ... In 2011, Bundestag deputy and later **party co-leader Katja Kipping stated that she believed The Left needed ""a double strategy [of] social-ecological restructuring plus left-wing populism""** to become attractive to voters. She elaborated: ""Left-wing populism means targeting those who are marginalized in our society in a targeted and pointed manner.""](

891,"False equivalence.

You can still make fun of French symbols in caricatures, no punishment. Whereas the people who made fun of said prophet in caricatures got killed. Then a teacher who wasn’t even mocking, just illustrating that event in a course, gets killed too!

So the Muslim response is disproportionate, based on exaggeration. And I do see Muslims condoning this murder and threatening more violence on social media. That is in fact how it happened for this teacher, Muslims were harassing him and calling for him to be punished, then someone paid one of his pupils to divulge his address. His life was sold for 300€.

The French state is Secular meaning it does not endorse any religion. So yes, your prophet or guru or imaginary friend doesn’t deserve any particular respect under French law. Christianity can be mocked, other religions get the same treatment.

Now I don’t know where you live, seems pretty brutal, but no you are not going to be imprisoned or killed for refusing to pay a fine in France. What typically happens is the state will seize the money from your bank account, maybe with some administrative fee as an additional slap on the wrist. So again, you’re trying to make a false equivalence.

Finally for dessert, France would be ""a nation who has a long racist history"". Well guess what has an even longer history of discrimination? Islam. The Muslim Empire invaded parts of Europe, and of course non-Muslims were treated as second class citizen.

Up to this day, Muslim countries are quite intolerant, say of atheists, homosexuals, and so on.
See, I’m a French with Tunisian blood and I’m an atheist. What would happen to me in a Muslim country? I’ve seen how they treat atheists and apostates.

905,"&gt; In the course of his three-and-a-half year presidency, Emmanuel Macron must have the record for the most number of international states antagonised in the shortest time. From eastern Europe to the United States via Brexit he has the knack of putting states’ backs up by a mixture of outdated Gaullian pomposity, lesson-giving and base tactlessness. The latest and most dangerous variant is with Turkey, which is already spilling over to the wider 1.5 billion Muslim world.

&gt; Macron’s differences with president Erdogan are not new. They have crossed swords over Libya (where Macron supports the renegade general Haftar and Erdogan the UN-backed faction), Nagorno-Karabakh (Macron for Armenia, Erdogan for Azerbaijan), the Aegean Sea and now over the Islamist beheading on 16 October of the French school-teacher who showed his pupils the Charlie Hebdo cartoons of the prophet Muhammad. 

&gt; France has recalled her ambassador to Turkey ‘for consultations’ after Erdogan stated that ‘Macron needs mental treatment’ for his campaign to protect France’s secular values against radical Islamism. Turkey has called for a boycott of French produce, which is now underway via social media in Qatar, Kuwait, Iran, Pakistan and spreading fast. 

&gt; In Trumpian style last night Macron took to Twitter to proclaim in French, English and Arabic citing universal values that France’s history is that of ‘a struggle against tyranny and fanaticism’. Stating emphatically ‘We will continue [to do so]’. This escalated things dramatically on social media in Algeria and across North Africa with death threats against Macron and now cyber attacks on numerous French websites, including a page belonging to France’s prime television channel TF1.

&gt; Whereas previous French leaders from de Gaulle to Chirac would have cooled things down, Macron’s tactless temperament has brought events to dangerous levels. The problems are numerous. Both Macron and Erdogan have similar electoral deadlines – Macron 2022, Erdogan 2023 – motivating a play to domestic audiences. Erdogan wants to obscure Turkey’s economic problems, Macron to obscure poor Covid management and to steal a march on Marine Le Pen’s populist right, whose trenchant criticism of Macron’s security policies on radical Islam and immigration are already a major electoral struggle.","Glory to you, Putin our saviour",/r/europe/comments/jjqwrf/why_is_macron_so_determined_to_infuriate_the_rest/gae7guj/,coffeebiscuitsandtea,1603902246

915,"&gt; But what is particularly dangerous in this escalation is its impact on France’s Muslim population of around five-six million, according to a 2017 Pew Research survey (though French law prohibits census data on the basis of ethnicity or religion). Most French Muslims are integrated, but a hard-core youthful fringe in France’s banlieues are easily radicalised and have contributed to almost a decade of home-grown Islamic terrorism. With Erdogan’s spokesman fuelling those fires by declaring that Macron’s treatment of Muslims in France was 'eerily' similar to 'the demonisation of European Jews in the 1920s', one can see where all this could lead.

&gt; Moreover, France is geographically on the fault-line along the southern Mediterranean rim with Muslim-majority states from Morocco to Egypt, many of which are unstable, highly volatile and susceptible to Islamic fundamentalism. Radical Islamic opposition parties have increased in popularity in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, all of which have direct links to France’s immigrant population. If the 1990s domino theory for Islamic fundamentalism to topple regimes across the Maghreb came to pass, France would be on the front-line. Add to that Erdogan’s campaign to present himself as the leader of the Sunni movement in the Islamic world (French Muslims are predominantly Sunni from North Africa) and one might have thought that Macron would act with greater statesmanship.

&gt; Macron’s problem is that he is too wedded to the old revolutionary conceit that French values are universalist values; what is good for France is good for humanity in general. That goes for freedom of speech, separation of Church and State and the rigorous state secularism of laicité. Yet the great French leaders of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, unlike Macron, were cautious about foisting those values on peoples abroad. As one of the founding fathers of the French 3rd Republic, Léon Gambetta, proclaimed: ‘Anticlericalism is not an item for export.’

&gt; Macron is a deeply unpopular figure on the international scene, even with France’s allies. It is significant how weak EU support has been for the French president in his standoff with Erdogan. Ironically it is likely to be Nato – so recently trashed by Macron as ‘brain dead’ – that will come to his rescue, especially as Turkey is a member. It will apply the diplomacy and statecraft that Macron so lacks to resolve the issue. If not then Macron is in jeopardy of provoking all on his own the ‘Clash of Civilisations’ predicted by the political scientist Samuel Huntington in his 1993 theory about future wars being fought not between states but between cultures, with Islamic fundamentalism the biggest threat.","Glory to you, Putin our saviour",/r/europe/comments/jjqwrf/why_is_macron_so_determined_to_infuriate_the_rest/gae7jec/,coffeebiscuitsandtea,1603902279

Basically North African gangs attacked a Chechen teenager because Chechens were not into North African gangs dealing drugs and cooperated with French police for it. Then North African gangs beat someone down, and Chechens had shown up to defend him. What they said was, they didn't want to cause problems but they had to stand up and defend Chechens there because police wasn't doing it.

The law is neither liberal nor conservative nor anything in between. The main purpose of the law is to bring justice to everybody.

You can appeal to the Constitution as much as you want but if you don't see a problem with a blatant Catholic fundamentalist  interpretation of the law that, if we want justice, was designed to escape such interpretations at first, then here it is, you've got what you couldn't anticipate.

1047,"I cannot believe you're still trying. You've lost the argument already. How many times do you have to be proven wrong until youre happy? 

Black British people come from immigrant backgrounds. People from immigrant backgrounds experience low social mobility everywhere on earth. Which words am I using that are confusing you? It's a simple concept to understand.

Almost every single black person in the UK arrived since 1950. Almost exclusively. So your talk of ""forever"" just further demonstrates your lack of historical knowledge.

&gt;You are so dug in to ignore this idea that youve admited that white privilege exists in non Western nations but you still are implying that racial privilege doesn't apply in Western nations, only a few days ago that Black people are nine times more likely to face stop and search than white people in England so if you can explain the maths around why the police thing black people are 9 times more likely to be carrying anything Illegal than white people id love to know when 76% of those stopped were innocent people. 

You seem to really struggle to understand my point here, so I'll try to explain it again. There is a slight advantage to being white when travelling/moving to other countries, as many parts of the world have positive Perceptions of white people due to colonial ideas. This I agree with. This is, however, 5% of the concept of white privilege. 95% of what people talk about when they say white privilege are domestic complaints relating to not being the majority. Thus they're talking about majority privilege.

For this reason saying white privilege is stupid, because it implies that the phenomenon is something intrinsic to white people. The phenomenon is not intrinsic to white people, it's intrinsic to being the majority in a country. Thus the concept is stupid. If it only referred to positive Perceptions of whites in asia/Africa, and the advantage that provides, it would make sense. In the context its usually used in, that's not what people mean, thus it doesn't make sense. 

&gt;The science backs of racial privilege, while their is actually no scientific evidence to back up an idea that ""immigrantation"" has anything to do with it, since immigrants can be white too. If your theory was true then we'd have far more polish people being stopped by police than black people since most black people aren't immigrants.

Nothing that you have said thus far has been scientific. There is no real academia on this, because it doesn't hold up to logical thought. It is closer to religion than science. Science does actually back up that immigrants have difficulty with social mobility, it does actually back up that eastern European and black immigrants have roughly equal chances of climbing the socioeconomic ladder. And finally, no, polish people wouldn't have to get arrested much more than black people, they'd need to get arrested at roughly the same rate, as both polish and black people largely came after the 1950s.",,/r/europe/comments/jfhzst/teaching_white_privilege_as_uncontested_fact_is/gadt1be/,82827r7,1603895251

1055,"Germany's non-lockdown measures seem to up until now have been more effective than baseline measures in other countries, meaning that strengthening them slightly might be enough to get the reproduction rate below 1 (it's currently at a rather less impressive 1.3)

Their focus mostly has been on restricting super-spreader events and contact tracing, so stopping trade fairs, big public meetings etc. while allowing small informal meetings in homes.

The key problem at this point is making sure that it's possible to keep the chain going, of isolating people when they get the disease and working out who may have infected them; people having close contact with strangers they don't know, or simply having too many infections to make tracking practical means the current measures become less effective.

The bottom line is, if the reproduction rate is just less than 1, and you can keep the virus at level that matches the capacity you have in your testing and treatment facilities, then you can keep going, if it starts to spike above that, you need to pull back until it comes under control again.

He was a towering figure of human ideals. His extraordinary leadership and his military genius accomplished so much for his country; first in battlefields, and then in building his nation, materially and in spirit.  He created a modern and sovereign state from the ashes of a defeated empire.  He was a great peace-maker, an ultimate reformer and a torch-bearer of freedom. He won not only the heart of his nation but the hearts of the oppressed nations as well. We all miss him.

Bill Clinton, President of the United States                                                                                                               I have no doubt that Ataturk is the greatest statesman of this millennium as he is the only leader who succeeded to become the leader of the century, not of the year.

Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States

In my interview with the Foreign Secretary of Russia, I asked him, to his opinion, who was the most remarkable statesman in Europe; without hesitation, he said the most remarkable statesman in Europe was Ataturk, the President of Turkey.

Following the death of Ataturk: 
                                                                                                                               My despair today is that I missed the chance of meeting that great man whom history books glorify lavishly. His achievements are mind boggling

Claude Farrere, French Author, Member of the Academie Française

When I met Ataturk, I was very impressed by his brilliant personality. It is hard to grasp Ataturk fully; he has many aspects, all profound. When I met him personally I admired his insight to the world affairs, his long vision and his articulation.  I immediately knew that I was in the presence of an extraordinary leader. I deeply cherish my memories of him.

Winston Churchill, British P.M.

If Ataturk had lived today the world would have been a more interesting place. When, in 1915, during our ill-fated Dardanelles campaign fate brought us across in Gallipoli we immediately knew that we were up against a military genius and a formidable strategist. Soon he emerged as a noble warrior.  Later he proved himself as a genuine peace-maker and a consummate statesman as well.

Sir Charles Townshend: British GemeralI conducted interviews with fifteen Kings and Presidents. I cannot remember one single incident in which I was as excited and impressed as when I interviewed Ataturk. He is very intelligent and a polished gentleman, he has a captivating personality with enormous power of spirit.

When I met him, I was awe-struck by his personality; in his demeanors the hallmarks of his civility shone through. He is truly a reform-minded leader; in fact, he adopted the Civil Code of Switzerland, and put it in use in Turkey. It takes innovative spirit, civil courage, and a passionate commitment to reforms.

The issue comes from the lack of healthcare workers, yesterday there were reportedly still a few thousand volunteer healthcare workers missing. This is just an overheard story from a hospital nurse, but what she said was that they were not taking on any volunteers over the age  of 50 due to the potential risk to them (though that might have been just regional decision). The trouble is that for example I think that around a third of Slovak primary physicians are aged over 60. Ideally primary physicians would be prime candidates to volunteer here, but they can't a significant part of them because of their high age.

Due to the fact how dreadful Slovak healthcare is both in terms of the state of the hospitals and terms of rewards, a huge part of Slovak healthcare workers leave to work in Germany and Czech republic. We have some Ukrainian immigrants who instead come to Slovakia, but not in sufficient numbers to cover for those who leave.

In Orava &amp; Bardejov there were some issues on the first day where the volunteer healthcare workers didn't show up or not all of them showed up, but gradually those issues were fixed because of the presence of the army medical personal. However I don't believe our army is capable of covering such a situation in multiple regions all over the country.

There was also some talk about no testing the least affected regions in case that they don't find sufficient healthcare professionals for the whole country, but for now we're being told that the testing will happen everywhere.",,/r/europe/comments/jje8e0/eu_vs_usa_coronavirus_cases/gad8dae/,SilenceFall,1603880669

1278,"The nazi privatizations were not like those in a capitalist economy. Firstly, significant assets came under control of the party and thus linked to the state. 

For the rest, assets were sold off to private actors to fund re-armament and yes, this would  in theory move the nature of the economy towards more private control. However, it had no intention of giving up final control. 

While private ownership did increase under the nazi state, state control of the economy was also increased massivly, with production quotas, price controls, industrial councils formed by the state, import controls etc. In fact the sovjet union had been experiencing with similar ""privatizations"" during the inter-war period. 

The diffrence between a socialist and capitalist economy lies not in public or private ownership but in who controls the means of production. I am not saying that the pre-war Nazi state was socialist in most definitions of the term, but it had an socialistic economy in nature. It was not the same as the pre-war sovjet economy, but they had more similarities than not.

Here are attitudes towards abortion itself - 



22% of Poles support abortion upon request until 12th week

62% of Poles support abortion under certain conditions (basically the compromise that was in place before the ruling)

11% of Poles want complete ban of abortion.

1386,"It's a mix. 

One problem is the closure of the international waters corridor between Greek islands on the center of the Aegean Sea if Greece expanded to 12nm their territorial waters. If this happened, Turkish warships could be denied free passage if they're threatening or on times of conflict, and Turkish warships and submarines would need to go on the surface along the Turkish coast.

Another problem is not on the Aegean corridor, but the EEZ on the eastern mediterranean. Castelorizo is a small archipelago off the Turkish coast that, if counted as Greek territory, would grant Greece control over most of the area between Cyprus and the rest of the Greek EEZ, which also contains some hidrocarbon deposits and fishing areas, but most importantly would allow a Israel-Cyprus-Greece pipeline to exist, and as said, severely limit turkey's maritime territory. 

&gt;The archipiélago is populated, so it would count as islands, rather than islets, so turkey has the losing hand considering the factors taken into consideration on the Serpent Island case. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_Delimitation_in_the_Black_Sea_case

&gt;They keep holding over to a vague part of UNCLOS (they reject UNCLOS but quote the parts they like) that says that the recommended ways of delimiting the EEZ must be agreed on a bilateral agreement and that it should try to be a fair distribution. 

&gt;They essentially say that as long as they don't accept, no EEZ can be set (correct), and that castelorizo can be ignored for EEZ as it is tiny and has few population (open to interpretation)",Spain,/r/europe/comments/jizk8v/greece_gets_f35_stealth_jets_meant_for_turkey/gad2ph9/,Franfran2424,1603874203

You made a point of religious offence, but the fact is that criticizing a Prophet and making derogatory imagery is not ""free speech""  it is ""hate speech"" . This problem persists in many european nations. When they critisize muslims it is seen as free speech when they criticize Zionists it is hate speech.  

To be honest the french don't find it free speech when their flag is disrespected.

1544,"It's more that Muslims agree (despite vocal minorities) that the acts of terror were disgusting, but also disagree vehemently with France's decision to project Hebedo's cartoons on the sides of buildings. This, seen as an endorsement of free speech in western countries and as a middle finger to islamic terrorism, is seen amongst Muslims as a middle finger to all of Islam. 

Every practicing Muslim, I've seen, feels anger at pictures of the Prophet Muhammad, particularly those made or distributed in bad faith. Unfortunately, fanatics have taken this anger way too far and went against the laws of the country they lived in (not to mention basic moral code or rationality), both of which can be counted as sins, but leave it to emotional people to not care about rationale. (Side note, it's even more tragic about this school teacher, who only used the cartoons as a thing to teach others. Should he have used it? Debatable. Should he have died for it?

The right course of action according to Islam would be to appeal to the courts of the country and seek justice through a peaceful manner. 

However, I think what is angering muslims mostly is macrons unrelenting criticism and actions such as displaying the cartoons on building. This will add fuel to the fire and cause more tension. 

What is astonishing, however is the fact that France is condemning those who are boycotting French products while doing actions which are adding fuel to the fire.  

The French state is very hypocritical it will label muslims who commit crimes as terrorists but will label the french ctiizens  who do the same as regular people.

Erdogan is infamous for not having a sense of humour (he once locked someone up for comparing him to Golem). Meanwhile, in private, Erdogan cheekily unveils a woman’s ass, likening its taboo stature in Islamic culture to that of the prophet Muhammad.

1614,"It was actually really great from an economic standpoint, because the wage and price level of the two countries were massively different. The GDP per capita in the west was 19.000$ compared to 5.100$ in the east. They either had to sacrifice the industry by devaluing it by using an 1:1 exchange rate for the DDR mark or to sacrifice the living standard of the population by using an realistic 4:1 exchange rate. Since the DDR industry was already without that devaluation not worth that much I would clearly say that they did the right call. Relying on investments from the west to rebuild might hurt the pride, but it's better than hurting the standard of living.

That the Treuhand also often sold to dubios buyers or frauds is of course true as well and I don't think anyone doubts that they made mistakes because they did neither have the personal nor the time to handle such massive privatizations.

However you are blaming here a lot of the problems created by the DDR on the unification. The millions without jobs were for example not because buyers from the west closed industry that was still profitable, but rather because unemployed in the east were given useless or unproduvtive jobs in the government or industry to pretend that unemployment doesn't exist.

One swallow does not spring make. So this show auto-censured itself, their problem for being silly. On the other hand, Charlie did not censor themselves, when the teacher was killed, their cartoons were projected on public buildings.

That said, I have to insist on my main point: did, at any point in your life, a muslim talk about their beliefs or did they try to force them on you? You conveniently skipped that and deflected to South Park. 

Where you and I disagree is how relevant is the change you are talking about. Sure, something must have changed. From where I stand, not much.

&gt; Parker and Stone note the contradiction in being allowed to feature a profane depiction of Jesus, while being forbidden to feature a purely benign depiction of Muhammad, but claim they harbor no hard feelings toward Comedy Central for censoring the scene, since the network confessed to being ""afraid of getting blown up"" rather than claim 'religious tolerance' like other networks.[2][48] Parker and Stone claim the only regrets they have over the incident was that their mocking of the show Family Guy in the episode generated more attention than its commentary on the ethics of censorship.[73] **Previously, Muhammad was depicted uncensored** and portrayed in a heroic light in the season five (2001) episode ""Super Best Friends"", which resulted in virtually no controversy.[2] **Muhammad also appears** among the large crowd of characters gathered behind the main characters and ""South Park"" sign in some of the show's previous opening sequences.

&gt; Trump literally has a bank account in China.

Why do you think it's illegal to have a bank account in China? You realize international businessmen often have international accounts right?    
  
&gt; How, specifically, is Biden sold to China?  
  
There are multiple instances of hordes of cash coming from China(and russia, and iran) directly to the Bidens. Here's 10 million a year (split 5 to hunter 5 to the big guy): https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/oct/15/hunter-biden-demanded-chinese-billionaire-pay-10-m/ from a single Chinaman.  
  
 &gt; Trump was literally on a plane with Epstein.   
  
You're confused. It's only leftist incestuous rapists that appear in the flight logs - Trump is not there and denounced Epstein 20 years ago. While Epstien's pimp was literally at Clinton's daughters wedding just a few years ago. We literally have the Bidens on video fucking their underage niece and smoking crack.    
  
&gt; Trumpers have really shown how susceptible Americans are to basic propaganda.   
  
The left has been hung up on muh Russia propaganda for 4 years - despite being proven wrong at every turn.  
  
&gt; You lack even primitive critical thinking skills.   
  
A blanket insult to cover the fact you're unable to back up your position with anything else.  
  
&gt; You stack conspiracy on top of conspiracy theory without realizing you’ve built a house of cards.   
  
Again, you've confused the left with Trump. Pee tapes, prepaying taxes, legally disclosed bank accounts, antifa being a figment of our collective imagination. People reeeeeing their brains out when he was confirmed based on media coverage of the dozens of things he was going to destroy but hasn't got around to. NPR literally plays commentary monthly on reactions to his election and how folks completely broke down because of what the media said.   
  
The right is living in reality and getting shit done. The left has spent the last 4 years in more desperate than last attempts to contest the results of the 2016 election. Hur dur my popular vote, hur dur my scotus appointments.   
  
&gt; And now your president is gonna steal the election because you’ve been primed with the “mail in fraud!!!” Theory that is absolutely baseless.  
  
Except there's examples daily of ballots being throw out and harvested. You missed the party line- it changed from ""There is no voter fraud!"" to ""There isn't widespread voter fraud!!"" keep up with your talking points if you're going to spew them out at random.  
    
&gt; Jesus Christ, I really want another civil war

Moscow only made it impossible to scede when it became clear that it would mean that some of its own republics could secede, but it remains a fact that it was legal under the constitution. 

&gt;For one OSCE Minsk group is a mediator for peace talks. Not itself a entity that has the legal power to determine the status NK.

That's where you are wrong. Budapest Summit Final document which was signed by Azerbaijan, Armenia and Karabakh;
&gt;Deploring the continuation of the conflict and the human tragedy involved, the participating States welcomed the confirmation by the parties to the conflict of the cease-fire agreed on 12 May 1994 through the mediation of the Russian Federation in co-operation with the CSCE Minsk Group.  They confirmed their commitment to the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and welcomed the political support given by the Security Council to the CSCE's efforts towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict.  To this end they called on the parties to the conflict to enter into intensified substantive talks, including direct contacts.  In this context, they pledged to redouble the efforts and assistance by the CSCE. They strongly endorsed the mediation efforts of the CSCE Minsk Group and expressed appreciation for the crucial contribution of the Russian Federation and the efforts by other individual members of the Minsk Group. They agreed to harmonize these into a single co-ordinated effort within the framework of the CSCE. 

Bruh even Azerbaijan doesn't deny that the OSCE is mandated to find a solution to the conflict, idk what you are smoking.

1922,"&gt; You can refer to this post, its late and I'm going to bed.

This still says what I am saying. Sodomy is punishable by death, when done in public or if you confess to a judge. Additionally, it uses a hadith to talk about effeminate men, yet completely ignores the fact that hadiths need scholars to explain them in context. Here is one for example:

Malik said from Hisham ibn Urwa from his father that an effeminate man was with Umm Salama, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He said to Abdullah ibn Abi Umayya while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was listening. ""Abdullah! If Allah grants you victory over Ta'if tomorrow, I will lead you to the daughter of Ghailan. She has four folds on her front and eight folds on her back."" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, ""This sort of man should not enter freely with you."" **(It was customary to allow men with no sexual inclination to enter freely where there were women)**.

&gt; Also - don't get me started on the fact Islam advocates sex slavery too...

Show me a single Quranic verse or hadith that encourages people to enslave, that says it is a ood thing that counts as a good deed. Because I can show you SEVERAL that encourage people to manumit slaves.

There is no ""sex slavery"" in Islam, there is, however, concubinage. A concubine had **nearly** the same rights as a wife.

The US also exported many of the materials that Iraq used to create chemical weapons which they used on Iranian forces during the war. The US also shot down Iran Air Flight 655, a passenger plane that was flying over Iranian territorial waters, killing all 290 people on board. In addition the US supports MEK who seek to overthrow the Iranian government. Early this year the US also assassinated Soleimani, who was pretty much Iran’s Secretary of State when he was on his way  to meet with the prime minister of Iraq to respond to a Saudi message.

2192,"&gt;Ankara / The Hague - The Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has filed criminal charges against the Dutch right-wing populist Geert Wilders. The reason for the complaint was insulting comments, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Tuesday. Wilders had used expressions that insulted Erdogan's ""honor, dignity and reputation"" and attacked his personality and reputation. The Dutch government sharply criticized the ad. Among other things, Wilders had shared on Twitter a caricature showing the Turkish president wearing a headgear in the shape of a bomb. He had written ""terrorist"" about it. Wilders also responded to the criminal charges via Twitter and called Erdogan a ""loser"".Erdoğan harshly criticizes Macron
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called the reaction of Erdoğan unacceptable: ""In the Netherlands, we consider freedom of expression to be the highest good and this includes caricatures of politicians.
Already at the weekend Erdoğan had criticized the Dutch right-wing populist for his tweet, but without mentioning his name. Erdoğan spoke of a Dutch ""distorted image of a member of parliament"" and warned: ""Know your limits!
Erdoğan himself is anything but reserved when he criticizes others. Thus he called European heads of state and government on Monday ""in the true sense of the word fascists"" and ""chain rings of National Socialism"". In the dispute over the Mohammed cartoons, he accused French President Emmanuel Macron of Islamophobia and advised him to have his ""state of mind examined"".

He considered that the crucial thing in getting techniques like this adapted would be getting agronomists onside. 

Do you know whether this sort of combined approach to farming is gaining any wider traction with agronomists? Or is it considered a bit hippyish? What are your thoughts on it?

2314,"The task of the Police is defined by Article one of the Police Law of my State as 

&gt;It is the task of the police to avert dangers to public safety or order (active defense). Within the scope of this task, it must prevent and combat criminal offences and make the necessary preparations for assistance and action in cases of danger. 

If they can expect danger, it's their duty to prevent that, even if no crimes have been commited yet. However, Article two also rules that

&gt;(1) Of several possible and appropriate measures, the police shall take the one which is least likely to affect the individual and the general public.

&gt;(2) A measure must not lead to a disadvantage that is clearly disproportionate to the desired success.

&gt;(3) A measure shall only be permissible until its purpose has been achieved or it becomes apparent that it cannot be achieved.

This is the Principle of proportionality, a key aspect of the rule of law and any police action in Germany. So in a real life enviroment, the officer-in-charge makes that decision. He might accept some objects that could technically be used as defensive weapons as long as the demonstration stays peaceful - or demand them to put it down before being allowed to continue.

not even majority of conservatives agree with what government is doing, support for stricter abortions, support was only 15% so thats less then even half of conservatives.
So government is ignoring will of people.

I have no idea where did your idea of fascism in earlier post come from.

I do agree that church has too much influence

People for the most part didnt care about LGBT for the most part,  people maybe werent huge fans of them but also didnt go out of their way to hate on them with some exceptions(there always are some assholes who would hate on them but they were minority). Situation related to LGBT turned for the worst with signing of LGBT + declaration by Mayor of Warsaw Rafał Trzaskowski, for the most part people didnt have problem with it, until they saw the WHO recomendation for sexual education that was added to it, the part about teaching young children(around 3 years old) about masturbation, that was the part that started to turn some people against LGBT believing LGBT wants to sexualize children. So, no it wasnt always like that, it had exact point where it started.

Also lets NOT missrepresent people who voted for PiS, people didnt vote for them because  the reasons you pointed since those reasons didnt play any role back then when they were elected. People voted on them because they felt abandoned by PO, fact is that PO didnt do much to help people from rural areas, not only that but in some cases they out right sabotaged them,  I am talking about via carpathia, highway going from Lithuania, through eastern Poland(least developed region), through slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and eventually ends up in Greek port city of Thessaloniki. Also in Romania there would be fork toward to the Black Sea port town of Constanta.

I would say that this highway can have very important role in the region seeing how it would connect Baltic sea, Black sea and Aegean Sea, it can bring significant investment toward eastern Poland.

So what happen was that someone from eastern poland made a petition to try to get funds from EU for this project, trying to get it added to EU TEN-T(Trans-European Transport Network) and stuff, EU agreed to send someone check viability of this project. so everything was going well but here is where the PO sabotaged it, PO MEP's requested this petition to be closed, claiming that this highway is not needed and that this region is already getting enough money, which is a total BS seeing how its least developed region with highest unemployment. some of those regions are on list of poorest regions in the EU, difference in average wages between west and east Poland can be as big as 1500 PLN.

The most fucked up thing is that it was happening when PO was ruling party, its pretty screwed up when your own goverment is putting effort to keep least developed region of your country from being more developed, they really screwed over people from rural areas here, and now people are wondering why that region dont want to vote for candidate of political party that screwed them over like this...

Even during last presidental elections PO did nothing to win over rural areas.

Simply put PO does NOT care about people from poorer regions, that makes it very easy for PiS to win them over promising them development for their region.",,/r/europe/comments/jig6os/journalists_peppersprayed_by_police_during_the/ga9cjgt/,Culaio,1603794333

2501,"&gt; A conservative US evangelical organisation is taking legal action against UK entertainment venues that cancelled appearances by Franklin Graham, a preacher who has expressed homophobic and Islamophobic views, earlier this year.

&gt;The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) is suing venues in Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield and Wales for breach of contract. Franklin Graham told the Guardian in February that he was “being denied [a platform] because of religious beliefs”.

&gt; The court cases have been highlighted by openDemocracy as part of an investigation that uncovered evidence of millions of dollars spent by the BGEA and other organisations on the US Christian right since 2007 to further their agenda in Europe and elsewhere in the world.

&gt;According to openDemocracy, the BGEA spent $20m (£15m) in Europe between 2007 and 2014, the last year for which the organisation’s filings were available.

&gt;It says that 28 Christian right organisations it investigated have spent at least $270m worldwide, often on legal interventions to support the restriction of rights, including on abortion, LGBT rights and adoption by same-sex couples.

&gt;At least $88m has been spent in Europe, more than anywhere else outside the US. For example, court briefs have been drawn up in support of the Polish government’s abortion restrictions, including a landmark ruling last week outlawing abortion in the case of foetal abnormality.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/jixaam/us_evangelical_group_takes_legal_action_against/ga965gr/,apple_kicks,1603787061

It's hard to say anything about percentages. We also have Latin and ancient greek. Latin mandatorily throughout school and greek is one option to choose from after four years. Same as french, spanish and italian. I just didn't mention it before, because it wasn't part of the topic. I myself chose ancient greek. So the only other language next to german I know is english. Ancient greek was taught pretty well in hindsight. From what I've heard of french class it appaerently was really bad. The teacher was hardly able to speak french so of course she couldn't teach the class. Of course thats just one example. I've met others that were pretty good at french after school. The split, at least in my class, was one third french, one third ancient greek and the last third split between spanish and italian. 
Yeah we really have that big brother/little brother relationship with germany. 
Our view of France is a country with rich history, great landscapes for tourism like Paris, the south coast, Normandy, Bretagne and mountainous regions and many more.

2674,"&gt;Get tougher on China and Iran

Getting tougher on China is a hard thing to place at. Germany has very deep economic relations with China, and with it we also have soft power over China (influence) like no other Western nation. But this also means that we do not criticize China in public and hold back a little.

Iran on the other hand is a no. We won't get harder on them. Iran is, compared to most other middle eastern countries, rather progressive. The hostility towards the West is mostly perceived as a result of decades of Western interference in their matters.

&gt; Use European firms for 5G 

This comes back to the first point. Germany will very likely not exclude China just because. If there are actual concerns that can be proven or considered reliable, that would be a good reason. But so far, with all the US boasting about having evidence that China has backdoors, so far no evidence has been delivered. It rather reminds Germans how leading up to the Iraq war the US said it had evidence of WMDs in Iraq, but that all turned out to be a lie.

&gt; Spend more on the military 

Already happening. But this was already underway before Trump took office.

&gt; Help end wars in the Middle East 

Won't happen with military power, Germany avoids sending soldiers to foreign countries like the plague. And the way Germany can end conflicts in the middle east via soft power, the US is very successful at torpedoing: See the Iran nuclear deal.

&gt; Stop Nordstream 2 

Not gonna happen simply because it is nearly finished. The only exception is if Russia does something truly disgusting like invading another EU members.

You say anything bad about religion, whether in social media or one-to-one? Especially in more conservative parts of the country you lose your job and will have a hard time finding a job again. In poorer countries this means much more than in richer countries. You are called a degenerate and agent or brainwashed of the ""west"". If you are believing an unusual sect (as an example), like if you are Alevi, they say eat no food cooked by an Alevi, it's a huge discrimination (but younger more secular people don't have this thankfully, but I think Turkey is societally more advanced than the other countries). In Pakistan, they ostracized Abdussalam for being of a different unusual sect, a freaking Nobel Laureate in Physics. You at the end become a pariah, with the proper use of the term. And it's very hard to live like that, even if you are not killed or something. And this happens to THOUSANDS of people, not just one.

Given that it is illegal in Islam to have sex, regardless of age, if it would cause harm, then that means she was fit. Find me a single piece of evidence showing that SHE (specifically) was harmed.

&gt; or childbirth ? 

Good thing then that she didnt give birth huh. Almost as if God knew that the marriage would not harm her.

&gt; not wait until the 19th century, like you claim 

Again, first law of marriage is that it should not cause harm. Age comes next. So as long as it would not cause harm (which changes depending on when or where you live) the marriage is valid regardless of age. Sex only happens if it would not cause physical harm.

&gt; ""Product of his time"" is not an excuse because he claims that he has contact with god himself. 

That is such a stupid thing to say. Let's take sodomy for example, that is banned in islam. Does that make it ""false"" because God should have known it would be normalised in the future? Of course not, God's laws are not subject to what WE think is ok or not ok.

&gt; Yet why didn't god tell him to stop doing barbaric things 6th century people do and teach him advanced wisdom like young girls like Aisha are not physically built for sex ? 

Find me a single piece of evidence that says she was harmed. Your entire reply is argument from ignorance logical fallacy. Unless you have actual records to back it up.

&gt; It doesn't matter if her family approved, Allah would have corrected him and said no this is wrong. 

Given that, not ONLY was she engaged before her marriage to him to someone else , but also that she grew up as one of the best Islamic scholars and literally led people into battle, I find 0 reasons on why this particular marriage was wrong.

Given that the minimum age of consummation, bar certain medical conditions that delay it for several years, is reaching puberty, that is not pedophilia. And given that the FIRST law is that the marriage should not cause harm, and in the modern day marrying that young causes harm most of the time, the government can put restrictions on any marriage below 18. Saudi passed a law stating that any marriage below 18 needs the approval of a professional psychologist and gyno for it to proceed. That is still fully Islamic as it is ensuring the first law (no harm) is upheld. Islamic law simply provides a skeleton around which to base rulings and is more nuanced than what most people know about.

&gt; While children being forced to have sex will literally damage them physically since they're not mature yet physically, it's a biological reality that ""Allah"" conveniently neglected.

2781,"Actually, as of the publication of 2018’s Annual Wind Technologies Market Report by the US Dept of energy (this pulls together a wealth of data to track trends in the cost, performance, and growth of wind energy globally but with a particular cost focus on North America and Europe) wind energy is now unchallenged as
 cheapest energy source on the market(thats in addition it being a free fuel, renewable and not killing the planet in the process)

The report concluded that U.S. and EU wind energy will continue to be one of if not the lowest cost electricity generation technologies available, with the long-term wind electricity price available through a power purchase agreement coming in at about half the expected cost of just running a natural gas power plant.


And because of stiff competition from natural gas and solar energy market when tendering for large scale public infrastructure projects - they succeeded in helping to drive even more saving In build costs as well as efficiencies in longer term farm management.

The next effect being a further reduction in costs for consumers.

And when you add to this:

1.) development of bigger turbines tailored to maximize their output even in regions with less than optimal wind speeds and ;

2.) supranational (EU) strategic investment in innovation and efficiency improvements in respect of ion battery design/chemistry and power storage solutions to support renewables

... well, the wind energy sector can expect to continue with the lower price and higher performance model that has defined for nearly a decade",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/ji9dz2/yesterday_wind_produced_almost_14_of_all_europes/ga8uizf/,Joy-Moderator,1603775237

And how do you know she did bear it physically given her age ? Any outside sources ? Children have died  from being raped.
What makes Aisha different. She may not have died due to internal injuries. But how do you know she did bear it ? And how messed up for a so called go to choose a child to be a wife of his so called prophet ?

Let's break up your reply:

1) Marriage is just about sex

2) You are only interested in echoing your claims

3) You have not understood what I explained

4) You believe that I am interested in marrying a minor (which, bty, is fully legal in most countries, so I dont even need Islam for that)

5) You have failed to back up any of your claims and have yet to give a single piece of evidence about how the marriage harmed Lady Aisha raa

6) You changed the topic of the argument from the Prophet's marriage to the Islamic law in general when I called you out on your lack of evidence to back up your claim about his marriage (specifically) and also failed to reply to what I explained about the law in general.

North Africa and Levant were majority Christian with some polytheistic religions before the Muslim conquests. 

Regarding Balkan Muslims specifically, Bosnian and Albanian Muslims only exist because of the Ottoman conquests, without them they never would have converted to Islam, that feels pretty safe to say.

3165,"TL;DR: farmer angry

The Dutch high court (Hoge Raad) ruled that Netherlands has to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by 25% at the end of 2020. Nitrogen was a particularly big issue and the Hoge Raad even ruled that no new construction projects would be allowed in areas near vulnerable nature as long as the government didn't reduce the nitrogen emissions (or rather, nitrogen deposition: nitrogen ""landing"" on Dutch soil).

Farmers (or rather, their livestock) make up for a disproportionally large part of the nitrogen deposition. As you can see in [this graph](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EOjxhpoWkAAbVlx?format=jpg&amp;name=medium), agriculture (blue) accounts for 46% of all nitrogen deposition in the Netherlands. 32% enters the Netherlands from our neighbouring countries (red), 6% is caused by road traffic (green) and another 6% by households (purple). If we ignore the nitrogen entering from foreign countries, we can reason that farmers cause 67% of the nitrogen deposition in our country, caused by our own country.

One of the proposed countermeasures is a plan to cut the Dutch livestock total by 50%. The Netherlands has an *insane* amount of livestock for such a small country, far more than it would need to feed its 17 million inhabitants. The Netherlands has 0,4% of all European landmass and 2,3% of the European population, but it holds [4,8% of all the bovine livestock and 8% of all pigs](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Livestock_population,_2016_(million_head).png) in Europe. It's just way out of proportion compared to its size and population. All the nitrogen caused by that giant amount of livestock is falling down on a really small piece of land, causing [damage](https://res.cloudinary.com/natuurmonumenten/image/upload/ar_1380:640,c_fill,dpr_1.0,f_auto,g_xy_center,q_auto,w_1880,x_576,y_384/v1/2018-11/vergrassing-ven_0) to the environment.

The plan to cut livestock in half caused a LOT of uproar from the farming community and all over the country, farmers went out [to protest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iIhi7Emjs). This new plan was the straw that broke the camel's back after so many regulation changes in the past decade.

They went to The Hague multiple times to protest, [running over the fences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE1vCkz_NEU) meant to keep the tractors away from the designated protesting field (Malieveld) and causing big traffic jams since they all went over [the highway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GN7Ku7AXVk). They even [stormed the provincial house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B_MSkkipI8) of Groningen (where the clip you replied to also took place), breaking down the door to talk to politicians inside.

You could say their protests were successful, as the plans to reduce livestock were cancelled/shelved. There was a more recent attempt where the agriculture minister suggested to reduce the amount of proteins in livestock feed (something actually proposed by the farmer unions as an alternative to halving the livestock), but after new protests that plan got cancelled as well. The actual solution to give Dutch construction projects some leeway was to reduce the maximum speed on the highway from 130km/h to 100km/h. It's a poor man's solution with a marginal reduction to nitrogen depositions (&lt;1%), but apparently it's enough to get construction going again.

Public support for these farmer protests was quite high in the beginning (70%+), but it dwindled (under 50%) after the numerous traffic jams, dangerous actions such as the one on the [Vismarkt](https://www.dumpert.nl/item/7774437_3e2067ff) and comparing the situation of farmers in the Netherlands to the Holocaust.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/ji9xre/farmers_taking_part_in_the_protests_against_the/ga7btzh/,McSwoopyarms,1603744290

3319,"1. Shocked maybe no, impartial definitely not. There is a long way to go before homosexual discrimination is as absurd in people's minds as left-handed people discrimitaion (who were considered satan worshipers)
2. Do you think children should stay in foster care also if there are straight couples wanting to adopt them? In that case, weird. Otherwise, you are clearly not treating equally hetero and homo couples. Having parents instead of a foster home is much better for the kids development. Having 2 parents is better than having 1. If the parents love each other, probably makes for a more loving family and might also help the development of the kid. In either case, gay adoption is better than single parenting which is better than foster care (regardless of how good it is in Poland).

The key here is that you think that being adopted by a homosexual couple will be negative in the long run for the kid, specially for their emotional well being. (Also not all kids have traumatic pasts, babies can also be adopted). Why do you think this?

About the civil union or marriage, I'm not familiar with polish law, but in Spain civil unions are not the same as marriage, probably they are also different in Poland. So we come back to the same thing, homosexuals don't have equal rights. A great 1st step would be to make marriage in the town hall for everyone. Later on there is the issue that the church is actively discriminating (by refusing to wed them as they would a hetero couple) against homo couples, but that is less important for many people.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/ji95vp/cartoon_in_dutch_financial_paper/ga6hkoc/,inkms,1603729541

Stored energy is required to carry the base load of the system, while peaking generation handles spikes. Currently, most renewables have a practical limit on being able to carry the base load as Lithium battery banks are both too expensive and have carbon intensive manufacturing processes. 

Nuclear energy is the most eco-friendly base load that currently is viable in most countries (particularly those with out geography that allows for hydro). While its admittedly not perfect, it’s the best option for lowering CO2 emissions. Electric cars need lots of energy, and Nuclear fission (and hopefully one day fusion) will be the only way to replace fossil fuels in cars with electricity.

So the judges, who are elected by politicians, voted over an arbitrary interpretation of a law which was in power since 1993, despite two members of the body having reasonable argument against such interpretation. Moreover such arbitrary decision is undisputable and final.

3476,"&gt;Conveniently ignoring voter turnout is higher in some demographics. You  seem to argue that only countries with mandatory voting laws are  representative democracies.

I am not talking about voter turnout. I am talking about gerrymandering and an fptp-ish system resulting in about 40-50% of the *voting* people voting for Fidesz giving them a 2/3 supermajority. If the democracy was representative then they would have a simple majority at best (but probably a large minority), they would not have the ability to rewrite the consititution, buy then dismantle all opposition newspapers (under thinly veiled threats, and since they control the legislative and executive branches mostly, they can carry those theats out), and the opposition could block a significant amount of bullshit.

If under the support of about 40-50% of the voters you have a 2/3 supermajority in the parliament, it is not representative.

Btw I would support mandatory voting everywhere. If you don't give so much of a fuck, you can always vote invalid, but the general apathy (and not just here) is fucking dangerous.

&gt;I actually agree with you on this one, and your seemingly angry premise  leads me to think that you suspect me of supporting illiberal democracy.  I don't.

No, I am angry about arrogant western europeans (especially the Dutch but no idea about your nationality tbh) being generally so fucking condescending towards Hungarians and Poles without actually understanding how the country works. A lot of Hungarians are backwards ass people but very few people in Hungary actually wants this.

This is not a democracy, period. It's just a more subtle form of dictatorship than say Belarus/Russia/China, with less censorship and oppression, and a thinly veiled illusion of democracy by wearing the dissicated corpse of the system it replaced as its clothes.

Basically ""wEll yOu hAvE eLecTeD tHEm"" is a useless ass response that makes my blood boil. When the recent news about Belarus was on topic everyone was like ""poor Belarussians I hope you succeed and get rid of Lukashenko"", but if there is anything about Hungary it's always ""well thats what those primitive backwards ass hungarians wanted since they elected them and its a democracy!!4444!!!, so shoo out of the eu cavemen"".

Fuck that.

&gt;Looked this one up before posting my comment. Observers from ODIHR  (OSCE) found that ""\[t\]he campaign was animated, but hostile and  intimidating campaign rhetoric limited space for substantive debate and  diminished voters' ability to make an informed choice. The ubiquitous  overlap between government information and ruling coalition campaigns  (...) blurred the lines between state and party"" but concluded in their  judgement of the election results themselves that they found ""some  violations but found no basis for annulment of results.""

Sure the elections themselves are mostly clean, there are very few people who dispute that (most shindigs are probably about distant voting for expats living in UK etc.).

This however absolutely fails to account for gerrymandered voting districts coupled with a semi-fptp system (you vote for both party and a local representative, party vote is mostly representative, while voting for a representative is fptp, hence so if 40% of the people in a district vote for Fidesz while the 60% remaining votes are scattered across opposition candidates, then Fidesz will claim that area completely), it fails to account for the fact that Fidesz oligarchs control almost all media in the country, hence they can easily spin an alternative reality that a lot of people *will not even notice*, and it fails to account for voter intimdation tactics (by that I mean tactics used outside the election booths and outside election time usually) used in villages and small towns where often Fidesz shills hold all important positions and you can literally lose your and never get another job or not have access to healthcare if you are known to be an opposition person, which means that the effective base of the opposition in these smaller shitholes is effectively zero due to self-censoring and little shitass feudal lords.

You don't get to notice that shit if you look at big cities like Budapest/Szeged/etc. or voting booths or campaign moves. It's those rural areas that gets Fidesh their supermajority.

I am telling you the only way Fidesz ever gets our of power is if Orbán dies and since the rest of them are incompetent yes-men, the whole party would probably collapse. Until Orbán is alive, there is not going to be a change of ruling parties, no matter what the population wants.",Soviet Hungary,/r/europe/comments/ji95vp/cartoon_in_dutch_financial_paper/ga64nau/,Ulrich_de_Vries,1603722966

Founder and Director of Women on Waves and Women on Web Rebecca Gomperts studied medicine and visual arts in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. After graduating Gomperts became an abortion doctor and sailed with the Greenpeace ship, Rainbow Warrior, as its doctor and as an environmental activist. While sailing in South America she encountered many women who suffered greatly due to lack of access to reproductive heath services and safe, legal abortions. These women and their stories inspired Rebecca Gomperts to start Women on Waves.

Rebecca Gomperts
In response to a growing number of help emails from women around the world, Rebecca founded Women on Web, an online medical abortion service in 2005. The service supports women living in countries where safe abortion is not available, to obtain information and access abortion pills. Every year Women on Web helpdesk members answer more than 100.000 emails from women all over the world.


In 2011 Rebecca completed a Masters Public Policy at Princeton University and in 2014 she completed her PhD at Karolinska Institutet.

Rebecca Gomperts also wrote a novel “Zeedrift” and published articles and essays. Rebecca Gomperts received the MS Women on the Year 2001 award, the Women making History award by Planned Parenthood of New York City (2002), the Clara Meijer-Wichmann Penning of 2002 by the Liga voor de Rechten van de Mens, the Margaret Sanger Woman of Valor award (2004) and the Global Women’s Rights Awards, Feminist Majority Foundation (2007) and Women deliver 100: the most inspiring people delivering for girls and women (2011).

This:

&gt; The polling turned out to be completely wrong

So...

&gt; Please go and look at actual relevant polling 3 weeks 

I mean, moving the goalposts, but...

Yougov 1-3 june, 45/41 for leave. 

ICM 3-5 june, 48/43 for leave.

Opinium 31 may - 3 June, 43/40 for leave, using old methodology. New methodology 43/41 for remain.

Plenty of polling suggested a leave vote being likely, prior to Jo Cox being murdered. Afterwards polls often (but not always) swung to remain, but leave was invariably within the margin of error as the result was always likely to be close.

You can look at the polling here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum#2016

&gt; I am not attacking pollsters

You said:

&gt;  The polling turned out to be completely wrong

Which is incorrect.

&gt;  I am attacking the Psy-ops campaign on Facebook that *pollsters had no means to model for.*

Which is also incorrect. 

I'm certainly not going to deny that cambridge analytica et al. engaged in voter disenfranchisement, and convinced likely remain voters not to vote.

But the polling did predict the result fairly accurately. They didn't know *why* people wanted to vote remain/leave.

The government’s drive to subjugate the judicial system and a growing tendency to criminalize defamation are beginning to have an effect on the freedom of expression of independent media outlets. Some courts are now using article 212 of the criminal code, under which journalists can be sentenced to as much as a year in prison for defamation, although the civil code offers citizens all the protection they need if they are defamed. Even if the courts usually content themselves with fining journalists, the use of article 212 encourages self-censorship by the independent media. The Warsaw daily Gazeta Wyborcza continues to be the leading target of government lawsuits.
&gt;
Partisan discourse and hate speech are still the rule within state-owned media, which have been transformed into government propaganda mouthpieces. Their new directors tolerate neither opposition nor neutrality from employees and fire those who refuse to comply. Many protests have been staged outside the offices of the management of the state-owned TV broadcaster TVP. After one of these protests in February 2019, the TVP evening news programme “Wiadomosci” broadcast video footage and personal details of ten of the demonstrators. TVP also filed a complaint against Polish ombudsman Adam Bodnar, who said its references to Gdansk mayor Pawel Adamowicz amounted to hate speech and implied that this could have encouraged the person who murdered Adamowicz in January 2019.

3831,"So you can clearly see that deaths are going down in September of every year in the upper graph. Which means some conditions improve over time, which ones I don't know. Maybe less traffic deaths, maybe people smoke less, whatever. Less people die because something is improving over time.

So now you compare September of this year where we know from the data that hardly any Covid19 deaths were registered with all previous Septembers. Keeping in mind the general trend I think it is not surprising there are less deaths again like all years before.

Next the comparison January to September, which is a bit of an odd timeframe for this since people started dying from Covid19 in Sweden only from about end of March to August. After that numbers were down the lowest level (since almost no infections occured).

So there we see the uptick to the previous year, which makes sense as we know more people died due to Covid19. Question is why is it not much more than the years before. Well, I'd assume it's because this graph includes any kind of death. Even with mild restrictions in place the behaviour of people changed. More have been working from home so less people went by car, should result in less deaths from traffic. See where this goes? You'd need some statistics over what subcategories of ""deaths"" there are to also see if any of these went down and if that is related to changed behaviour.

I think overall the message should still be, more people died this year than the last year and this broke the trend of having less people die each year.

That's a bit better than ""what about"". I don't feel like DMing people on reddit cuz you never know who you're talking to really, thanks for offering.

&gt;where you draw lines

There is no line to draw. If you think you are ""murdering"" the foetus, you are also murdering a tooth, or a leg. We use terms like ""dead tooth"" to tell people they need to have it removed before it starts damaging the human body. You can look for the ""heart tooth disease"" and all the others weird stuff you can get if you don't get your tooth taken care of.

If you're willing to keep your tooth because you cannot objectively think that this will harm both the tooth (it's dead/broken) and your body (it's attacking your gum, poisoning your blood), then you keep your tooth, and then you die within maybe 5 years. Good luck with the pain too. The outcome will be terrible and the amount of winners in this situation is: 0

But at least, you're not killing the tooth, which is the most important thing of all. Same applies for the foetus.

3906,"&gt; There are many people in /r/europe who want Muslims to be ""removed"" from the country and hope provocations like these will show them the way out. Some of them are even in this thread.

Good,as we concluded a bit earlier about 15% are in support or support in part of terrorist attacks.Those people leaving would be awesome.I would actually agree if there are people that would leave after seeing 1 cartoon those people didnt belong in the first place here.Less extremists in europe is always good.

There is a big problem with muslims adapting to european countries and its not just cartoons.

63% of people of Muslim faith questioned perceive homosexuality as ""an illness"" or ""a sexual perversion"".

29% of Muslims surveyed by Ifop, violence against homosexuals is sometimes understandable.

Not very tolerant people.

&gt; You don't even need to get religion involved here. It's just called not being an asshole. As Frenchmen you may not realize this, but what you're doing is so absurd from a Muslim perspective it's like forcing a Jewish person to press the elevator button. It's haram just to look at those images and you're plastering it all over the place deliberately so they see it.

Im not from france.It doesnt matter what is haram and what not that is that you cant understand.


Im very curious i have 2 questions.

1) Being gay is also haram for muslims, what do you think we should do with gays?Should we make homosexualty illegal?What about ads that include gays?Do you think we should ban them so muslims dont have to see them?What about gay people kissing in the street forcing muslim to see it?Ban it too?

2)What would you asnwer to the small minority of hindus in Europe if they said that killing and eating cows going is against their beliefs, that cows are sacred and killing/eating them is extremely hurtful for hindus?",,/r/europe/comments/jhzn7w/europe_responds_to_turkey_sorry_to_disappoint_but/ga4zvn5/,arnaoutelhs,1603686798

3910,"The 1920 map of Europe is not *that* dissimilar to that of today. The general trend has been towards greater fragmentation as some stress or other that appears brings nationalism to the fore and people have been more able to successfully prosecute struggles for independence, so the largest difference between the maps is that some previously unified countries have split (some exceptions present, of course.)

I would question what dynamic force one might expect to propel a depopulating and graying Serbia into being some juggernaut capable of taking and holding Kosovo despite Kosovo being now far more organized to oppose this than at any point before and vehement about independence over autonomy now that it’s been tasted, and the presence of other local and global countries that are strongly invested in Serbia not conquering Kosovo and potentially pushing its luck to snowball up to other territories it may think to claim as “Greater Serbia”. Where would a surge of support for Serbia be expected to roll in from? Is there a circumstance where Kosovars are going to forget what Serbia did to them and how their relations have been so poor ever since?

The generations in the 70s became known as the ""decreetees - decretei"" because of the decree that made abortion and contraception illegal. Interestingly enough now it's that generation that is putting pressure for a lot of change in Romanian politics, and considering their past, I'd call them a strong generation.

If there's no risk of destruction, the oppressors have no motivation to act quickly. They can just wait for the moment to pass and the oppressed to slowly disperse as they get dragged back to their other concerns.

What's more, as seen in the BLM protests, the authorities have no problem using force to disperse peaceful protest and then using resistance to that force to justify greater levels of force. So while peaceful protests are a good idea, real change only happens when it is made clear that violent protests are primed to happed if the issues are not dealt with quickly and adequately.

This is evident historically by the complete lack of peaceful revolutions without extenuating circumstances. Try to find a single instance where an authoritarian regime with a functioning economy and no external pressure folded to peaceful protests.

4067,"&gt; Even if we were to take the higher number, this form of protest doesn’t target only radical Muslims, but the entire community. It in fact strengthens the radicals’ position as the community feels marginalized, and it’s used as validation for their extreme beliefs.

It isnt supposed to target anyone.Everyone is allowed to make cartoons of islam,christianity etc.There are no blasphemy laws in France and they dont plan to adopt them.It the muslims that need to realise that **they** need to adapt to France not the reverse.

Right after the terrorist attack in charlie hedbo in 2015 the favorable views in France towards muslims actually increased to 76% the highest among Europe.

After that there have been terrorist after terrorist attacks.**35 Terrorist attacks** the last 8 years and seven terrorist attacks just this year.

After the insane number of terrorist attacks the big minority that supports them and the big number of muslims that reject the republic values in favor of religious beliefs, i think France's patience is running low and they want to make clear that this is France adapt and deal with it.

4084,"Civil unrest is generally hard to wait out for authoritarian leaders, because regardless of whether it is violent or not the people participating are dissidents. The US is not an authoritarian country, so that example was merely used to highlight how the public views the issue of civil unrest, not how the government ends up handling it.

&gt;Try to find a single instance where an authoritarian regime with a functioning economy and no external pressure folded to peaceful protests.

It's not about the government folding as if it's a game of cards, it's about the government losing power. If they cannot police their own state then they've failed as a leader and their flaws are laid out, day in day out, for all to see. It makes it significantly easier for an oppressed minority that might otherwise be ignored to broadcast their issues, whereas that same oppressed minority being violent will simply justify the governments own violence.

Historically I believe there were other issues making peaceful revolutions unlikely, and while I'm sure there's merit to doing comparisons in the modern world just something like food access and communication networks greatly change how we operate within our societies.

Basically what I'm saying is that an oppressed minority needs to play politics in order to get it done, that means they need to gather supporters and work through society one layer at a time. Failure to do this will require society to be *very* sympathetic to your cause, otherwise you will have a hard time getting anything done.

Once an uprising has popular support then violence will work just fine, maybe even better than non-violence, but as we've seen that ain't easy to accomplish. There weren't many heterosexual people willing to go to bat for the homosexual community even 30 years ago, and they were an oppressed minority. Would the gay community have gained or lost sympathy in the 90's if they were violent? Probably gained. Would they have in the 1940's, or earlier? Play politics if you can't win, and consider the implication of violent tactics unless you're very confident that your countrymen will stand, or at least support, you.",,/r/europe/comments/jhyyfk/the_belarusians_are_cool_they_strive_for/ga4sx5w/,MexicanGolf,1603682244

4098,"&gt; you would also call other religions like christianity backwards too

Any belief in an imaginary sky-friend is backwards.  However in almost every ""Christian"" nation one could think of, everyone has come to an agreement that religion is a private issue, laws and governance are a public one, and ne'er the twain shall meet.

&gt;why doesn't anyone have a problem with how nuns dress?

Perhaps because the same religious laws that govern nuns also govern priests, so there is no automatic mysogynistic angle on a nun's habit AND nuns and priests are part of the clergy, not lay-believers.  Catholics don't say ""all our women must cover their hair, lest the rays of temptation that men cannot resist shine from their locks and lead men to rape them. But men can dress as they please.""  That is islam that says that.

&gt;That's like blaming all the men in the world for being sexual predators because of the actions of a few disgusting men.

Not at all, and that is a bollocks argument.  Men do not choose to be born men.  Muslims *choose* to be muslim.  And ""a few bad people""?  Really?  Just a few?  Certainly those carrying out actual beheadings are a tiny minority, but it has already been demonstrated than a very large percentage of muslims in France hold the view that, while they may not support the act of beheading, the teacher was in the wrong for showing the cartoon.

Look, you are free to believe and act as you want in a muslim country.  I won't begrudge that at all.

4212,"Me and other activists contacted the researchers who worked on ""non violent protests"" and who concluded that the non violent ones are more successful. We contacted them to get more details because most of us come from ""ex"" colonized (=neocolonized) territories and we believe that the conclusion is very unfair to our experiences after reading the methods of research.

We don't think that the work is useless, actually it's very useful but we believe that it minimizes the importance/context of many other violent protests around the world which put into context were key to MORE non violent protests.

It's a very fine nuance that they missed, and after contacting one of the leading researchers like a year ago (can't remember her name but she published a book about it, and she is currently in Harvard), we were met with zero answers multiple times.

So I would say this is a topic that requires a lot of nuances and more works. And don't forget that there is a timeline/limited regions for this work.

This comment is not to say that non violent protests are useless, but I'd like people to dig deeper and understand the mechanisms of civil protests across history, understand the context the effects/consequences before saying ""non violent good, violent bad"". It's complex.

Furthermore you are suggesting that peaceful protest equates to not paying any more taxes. The government can and will crack down on tax evasion if they need to. Additionally, most people are not willing to run the risk of imprisonments for civil disobedience. This especially applies to everybody except upper class people, who have people to support. 

But tax evasion has the potential of making change if coordinated. However, peaceful protest is just an appeal to those in power to fix the maker without any real threat. ‘Keep on being corrupt, we’ll keep on standing here and that’s it’.

This is disingenuous. The election results were 51-49. Yeah, technically it's a ""majority"". But practically, it's about half.

And that's with PIS artificially boosting turnout of their electorate - straight up promising material goods for the regions which have highest voter turnout - but only those with &lt;20K population - coincidentally, the only region size where they have majority support. And sending emergency SMS alerts before elections that seniors can vote out-of-turn (supposedly because of covid). And of course with promising 13th and 14th pension; stuff like that.

Also, not every single one of PiS voters voted primarily because of the anti-LGBT thing.

Ask different sources and they can tell you different answers but i can tell you that we on both sides are still scarred by it. War is nasty. There were some talks in Rambouillet, where S.Milosevic was asked (even some times before) to withdraw their troops and Albanians in Kosovo could get a special status of sorts. He refused and the war was still raging. And this was a perfect time for daddy USA to step in. They bombed Belgrade and they set up a millitary base which is still active to this very day for peacekeepin, or so they say. 2000-2008 kosovo was under UN rule (UNMIK) 2008 with the help of the US we declared independence.

4499,"&gt;Not really. Using a veto costs political capital and requires some clout, we don't have either of that. Nothing is the EU's fault, in the scheme of things we're just irrelevant to it. We constitute barely 5% of the EU, and our influence is reflected in that. It's just about nothing or a rounding difference.

The frugal 5 constitute about the same amount of people, and way more economic power than Poland and Hungary. The fact that we don't play it hard enough is what hurts us, nothing more.

&gt;It's not. We don't have any influence because we're on the wrong side of things. Small memberstates is also a bit of a stretch, both Hungary and Poland have more influence then we do.

Hungary has a 2nd world economy and a population of only 10 mil. Poland is larger than us in terms of its population but it's economy is even more backward.

&gt;We didn't. They got everything they wanted, which was everything we didn't want. Higher budget, mutual debt, higher contributions.

&gt; In practice power depends on shifting coalitions and interests influenced by specific types of policy (agricultural, budgetary, fisheries, taxes) and institutional rules (QMV, Simpel Majority or unanimity voting).

4616,"**Estonia**

* Political scandal as the interior minister (from the alt-right nationalist party EKRE) said that ""gays better run in Sweden"" and ""I have unfriendly attitude towards them"" to Deutsche Welle. The PM said it's unacceptable, yet didn't even demand an apology and in fact, endorsed referendum for constitutional ban of gay marriage, to be organised in the spring. This means the government has taken a sharp turn towards the alt-right as a whole. Simply put, Estonia is on its way to become the next Poland/Hungary.
* Tensions in Estonia flared up as another member of EKRE accused the public broadcaster of ""displaying gay propaganda by enraged sodomites"" and accused the public of not understanding the new ""national"" government. This is the same guy that called Russians ""parasitic 5th column"" and refugees ""human trash"", yet was sent to represent Estonia at European Council's Parliamentary Assembly by the government.
* A petition was founded to counter-attack the government's position, which demands legalisation of gay marriage. As of today, over 20 000 people have signed it. The parliament will have to discuss it, but it's unlikely it will achieve much. Many public figures have criticised the government as well.

They fought to not have 12 fuckin billion dollars in money. You can build quite a few tram lines with that money.

The abortion thing , if I am right, isn’t the result of say a referendum in the country but is linked  to the government undermining the independence of the judiciary. If they were next to say withdraw property rights from certain ethnic groups would that be internal?  Can the EU as a group of democratic nations accept governments of individual countries ignoring the rules of the EU and acting to prevent independent judiciaries and media in a way that is likely to undermine Democratic processes and the rule of law ( which is in the EU treaties). Though I would be concerned about democratic majorities being illiberal , I agree that you can’t have democracy only if you agree with the decisions made - but the EU is a bit pointless if it doesn’t uphold its own formative ideals or rules - or if allows democracies to be hollowed out and move towards the sort of pseudo democracies you have in neighbouring countries.",,/r/europe/comments/jht07b/despite_sanitary_sanctions_protests_in_poland/ga278ef/,Mkwdr,1603636411

4713,"LOT Polish may lead new airline for Poland, Czech, Hungary, &amp; Slovakia

According to a number of media outlets, the governments of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia are discussing the possibility of creating a single airline to serve Central Europe. The four EU member states are also part of the Visegrád Group, or V4. Together, their population rivals the UK, France and Italy.

Between them, the V4 account for half of all seat capacity in Central European nations. In addition, Central Europe's three biggest airports – Warsaw Chopin, Prague and Budapest – are in the V4. Moreover, the two largest airline groups by intra-Central Europe capacity – LOT and SmartWings Group – are based in the V4 (Hungary's Wizz Air has a much more pan-European network).

Central Europe lacks an airline with a truly global scale and its aviation market is even more fragmented than Europe's as a whole. At a time when demand has collapsed due to the COVID-19 crisis, airlines are struggling for survival.

Consolidation in Central Europe around a V4 airline, possibly led by LOT, certainly has some attractions.

Women who decide against abortions probably don't decide so because the experience is not enjoyable, but because they have  reasons to keep the baby. 

Women who decide for abortions don't decide so because they don't mind the procedure, but because they have reasons not to keep the baby. 

The point is, the medical procedure itself is not the issue for or against. 
What can stand in the way is indeed the legal procedure and how doctors may treat you (or actually dont want to treat you). And that, what  I heard/read from many women is one of the more damaging parts of the procedure. 

Because if you do not want to get the baby, you can overcome the physical and mental pain. But to be shamed for your decision, to fight for it, to be denied it, THAT is damaging.",,/r/europe/comments/jhqw4s/lets_pray_for_a_right_for_abortion_today_in/ga1tg89/,CreatureInVivo,1603629146

Yeah, exchanging 'pills' with 'contraceptives' would've left less room for misunderstandings and side-tracks, but that's just semantics, isn't it? ;) Because the issue is the same.

I agree. My personal point of view is that forcing women to carry unwanted children to term is so damaging both on the individual and societal levels (i.e. the old nightmare orphanages of Romania) that anything else than free abortion up to the second trimester is insane. Glad to learn that you and many other reasonable Poles agree, and that the new law sparks a fiery debate/is met with resistence, for all of Europe's sake because what happens in one country affects the others.

4785,"The Almohad Caliphate established the capital of Al-Andalus in Seville around 1200.

The fact that Granada did not formally become part of Andalusia until 1833 does not mean that Andalusia did not exist.

After the Christian conquest, the offices of [Adelantado Mayor de Andalucía](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelantado_mayor_de_Andaluc%C3%ADa), [Notary Public of Andalucía](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notar%C3%ADa_mayor_de_Andaluc%C3%ADa) and [Hermandad General de Andalucía](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermandad_General_de_Andaluc%C3%ADa) already existed in the 13th century.

In the First General Chronicle, ordered to be written by Alfonso X el Sabio. The semantic value of the terms of Andalusia and Andalusians is the Roman Betica or the southern part of al-Andalus:

""There is another land in Andalusia that is called Bethica because there is a river that used to be called Bethis, which now is called Guadalquivir"" (PCG, I. p. 7a, 2-5).

 ''Otra tierra ay dentro en ell Andaluzía que llaman Béthica por que  corre  por ella un río que solíen llamar Bethis, al que agora dizen  Guadalquivir"" (PCG, I . p . 7a, 2-5). 

In another passage the chronicle comments that:

""That time forward was the province of Betica called by the name of those vandals, who heard it fortunately, Vandalia in Latin. who wants to say as much as Andalusia in the Castilian language'"" (PCG. I. p. 210a. 1-6). 

""daquella sazón adelante fue aquella prouincia Bética llamada del nombre  daquellos vándalos, que  la ouieron por suerte, Vandalia en latín. que   quiere  tanto  dezir  cuemo Andaluzía en el lenguage castellano'"" (PCG.  I. p . 210a . 1-6 ). 

Referring to the preparations for the Battle of Alarcos, in which Alfonso VIII of Castile suffered a tremendous defeat at the hands of the Almohads (1195), the chronicler states that the Caliph ""filled the campinnas of Andalusia with many guises"", among which were the ""almohat and ell andalrn; land of Guadalquivir""

""enllenó las campinnas del Andaluzía con uozes de muchas guisas"", entre  las que destacaban el ""almohat y ell andalrn; de tierra de Guadalqueuir""",,/r/europe/comments/jhpemy/sevilla_capital_of_andalusia_since_1200_from/ga1toj1/,fulanax,1603629272

It actively engaged in propaganda that explained how economics worked and helped cause improved living conditions for the U.S. during the 30s by supporting unions - thus making life a hell for our rich leaders who deserve to be there.

It improved grain production through collectivization thereby ruining prices for the landlords in Ukraine - forcing the landlords to have to burn food and slaughter cattle and eliminate peasants who didn't know their place.

It ruins the lives of many thousands of landlords of China and stole their land and gave it to rabble rousing poors who would whine and bitch about food and jobs like a bunch of lazy bums. With that land they were well fed and found work and had improved lives. This was a huge atrocity because then China lost the economic support of freedom loving CIA - the former pro-nazis that they had to flee to Taiwan. 

In Russia, things were looking pretty good when the Fred Koch paid good money to build oil rigs there and fund education on building and researching it to the peasants there - but then after they were built evil Stalin stole the oil rigs and nationalized them and used their benefit for the people instead of for business like a rational and practical man. Companies like Exxon could have used that wealth to further spend decades hiding climate change. Now that we know climate change is a thing, we're all worried and stealing profit from good billionaires. The fallout to that sort of thing is horrific.

Every country where socialism has risen literacy, education, and health care has risen - which suppresses profit extraction for the U.S. and it's allies.

Recently socialists took back Bolivia with evil democracy - where the U.S. was going to enjoy it's free lithium mining and effective slaves it could murder if they unionized. But now all our Teslas will cost like a thousand dollars more and Musk is super sad about the whole thing.

4863,"Police officer Norbert Paksi confessed to everything and, according to his lawyer, did not even file a complaint against the accusation.
 At nine o'clock in the morning, the specialized criminal court in Pezinok began to decide on detention for police officer Norbert Paksi and special prosecutor Dušan Kováčik.  Both are accused of founding and conspiring a criminal group, of corruption and of bringing classified information to the mafia.

 The daily N found out that the suspicions against Kováčik are not only related to the Takáčov family, but are even more serious.  Former director of the Criminal Office of Financial Administration, Ľudovít Makó, is suspected of plotting the murder of investigator NAKA, along with others, and Kováčik is also accused of helping him thwart this investigation.

 Makó is a suspect in preparation for the murder of investigator NAKA, together with Marian Kočner and three other people.  The case has been prosecuted for several months.  Paks told Makó about the whole case, but according to the police, Makó wanted him to provide him with more information about this act.  Kováčik then handed over an envelope to Makó in August this year, containing parts of the investigation file on the matter, including classified operational records.

 According to the allegation, Kováčik also helped Makó in another case, where the former head of the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration was suspected of indirect corruption.  Kováčik again handed over Makó documents to the case, where he himself was a suspect, thus obstructing the investigation and, according to the police, abusing the authority of a public official.

 Mako was arrested in September this year.  After the resignation of the Minister of Finance, Eduard Heger, several witnesses and victims who were blackmailed or threatened were stopped.

I think a small waiting period before getting it should be a thing (a week maybe).

I despise that we have started to see abortion as something that people ""just do"" to get rid of stuff they don't feel like doing right now. People in stable, years long relationships should not be aborting simply because it's slightly inconvenient at the moment career wise, for example.

In that way, I understand the backlash abortion is getting the past decade.

I think the best way to combat this is proper sex education, pro-family education (and yeah, propaganda) in schools to promote the idea of starting a family and also some further education on options besides abortion (did you know you can give newborns up for adoption to some very loving families?

It further stated that the incidents that had been reported were forwarded to the Greek coast guard, which opened an investigation into the matter. The Greek government gave a blanket denial to the allegations, saying that it complies with the law and does not carry out illegal deportations.


&gt;Under Frontex’s statutes, police officers are required to file so-called Serious Incident Reports to document violations of the law. But people familiar with the situation say that fewer and fewer of these reports are getting filed.

4963,"Abortions were allowed in three cases: rape/incest/crime, danger to mother's life, and severe fetal defects. The ""constitutional court"", which is staffed mostly by judges that will do anything the ruling party wants, decided #3 (fetal defects) was unconstitutional. Most (~98%) legal abortions were due to that, getting an abortion in the case of rape is very difficult with just 3 (three) cases last year. Look at the graph in this article: https://oko.press/polska-pieklem-kobiet-pis-i-trybunal-julii-przylebskiej-wprowadzili-zakaz-aborcji/ — can you even see the rape/incest cases (black bars) on it? The red bars are now unconstitutional, the green bars were ""social reasons"" (unconstitutional since 1997).

Rulers can decide what religion they follow and other rulers of other states can´t decide to invade based on that.

You will still get a secretary of education that is not committed to the good of the people, you will still have tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars spent on ridiculous things like tables and hammers (see : auditing the pentagon budget), you're still going to have a press secretary that will lie to you, just like under Obama. The lies will be more excusable, the abuses less flagrant, the willingness to suck up to corruption couched into more easily excusable pretenses such as bipartisanship, and you will still have a State Department that will fuck everyone over and slowly destroy the trust in the United States, like under Obama, which may I remind you, **hacked the communication devices of many European leaders**,  you're still going to have imperialism. All of that. It won't be as bad, it will look nicer, and better excuses will be found, but make no mistake, Joe Biden is going to continue the slide of America into decay, just more slowly. Under Joe Biden, you will still have endless war and suffering abroad. 

***Most of all, the conditions that led to Trump will come back, and Joe Biden will enable an even worse version of Trump to happen***

Under Joe Biden, you will continue having the US and it's allies say to less fortunate countries that ""elections may not be allowed to change fiscal policy"". 

Do you think that Obama, Biden, and the democratic party share no blame for over a hundred million people making the catastrophically stupid decision to vote for Joe Biden? If anything, the people with the most power to prevent Trump from happening are the democrats, and look where this led us.

That would make islam magically exempt from human psychology. I don't believe in magic or gods, so I don't accept this explanation.

&gt; This is what islam has in it, you read it and it's there.

So it's exactly the same as protestant christianity, which was founded on the idea of *sola scriptura*, which holds the Bible as the only infallible authority.

Despite that, different protestant churches focus on different parts of the Bible, while some parts are ignored. There is also interpretation. The Bible, just like the Quran and Hadiths, are written in human languages, which means they can be creatively interpreted. That interpretation depends mostly on personal ideology.

Different interpretations can result in **massive** changes in doctrine. If you don't believe that to be the case for islam too, you are engaging in magical thinking again.

&gt; It tells you to kill. Tells you who to kill and why and how. Tells you the rewards you get for killing.

Oh look, the same fucking thing as in the Bible. There's a whole lot of talk about martyrdom in christianity, and not all of it is the peaceful kind.

This is also good for individual EU countries, because when they issue bonds, the investors don't trust them as much. They trust Germany a lot, so Germany has easy access to funds. They don't trust Greece a lot, so Greece doesn't have the same access or has to pay ten times the interest that Germany pays.

My ancestors have been displaced in Bulgaria, only to be displaced yet again years later with populations exchanges. From other side of country, other parts of my family have yet again been displaced by Russian invasion and moved from the North to the West. Each time, we lost everything basically. 

In the distant past, at least 2 children in my family have been essentially kidnapped and forcefully converted to Islam, only to escape - yet again, documented by the church.

That's just part of this. I consider myself quite lucky. My girlfriend's family was essentially genocided by our fascist regime in the 30s. They had to run, and after decades in Israel, they returned, to a devastated community that is now 6000 people left from hundreds of thousands.

There is indeed weirdo nationalistic propaganda here, and our communist regime also did it. It's quite cringe. I don't really like glorifying historical figures for nothing or the ""Christian shield/defense"" myths. I'm not even religious.

5327,"The whole thing is neither productive nor helpful to anyone. And yes, considering that you too did the exact same thing we could be arguing about who was the dishonest one for the next century and it would be no more productive.

Look, if you are capable of trying to understand what I'm saying and asking for clarifications instead of going “no, you're wrong, how about my version” which from my perspective you seemed to be doing but which you may not have aimed for and I'm not going to guess, we can try to bring this to the end. No claims of attacks, no ... other things of this kind, let's *calmly* get to the end of this. Because at this point it's basically a children's squabble and not a discussion, and we probably should both be ashamed, not “me”, not “you”, one way or another it's our discussion and we should both be ashamed, we both made it lead here.

----

The problem with how you look at it is that you seem to think that the specific piece of this particular law codex is only about rape, but it isn't. It's about “rape and sexual coercion” (“Zgwałcenie i wymuszenie czynności seksualnej”, you can check this) and there's no rules for which is which in the codex itself so judges are free to interpret any act that normally you would think rape as either rape or sexual coercion depending on ... basically whatever, which sets legal precedent after legal precedent. If you check the laws regarding the statute of limitations about this you will find out that it does not name any acts specifically but rather uses the legal definition of those acts. As such, rape *is* poorly defined because unless the judge rules it to be rape anything that's alleged to be it may instead be counted as sexual coercion, making it poorly defined as there's no specific wording that “this and this and this is rape”, and this *is* a problem with the law itself.

To add to this, and you can check this too, there is legal precedent of rape on people who were both too drugged to consent and unconscious as a result of physical violence to be not 197.1 (rape or sexual coercion) but instead 198, and many other unlawful sexual acts get classified as something else too. This is not a problem in itself when it comes to just the definition, no, but it is a problem when the writ of reasonable suspicion is by itself not worth anything unless the person is capable of proving that this specific act of sex that was unlawful is the reason for their pregnancy and not some other act of sex. This is important because part of the fact that in some cases this is unprovable and has to be ruled by a judge during the court proceedings (when you get the court papers with the sentence there is a section about the reasoning of the judge and there the judge can describe the fact that you got impregnated by the person who assaulted you, thus giving you the paper you need), and often only the simplest cases, which rape cases are compared to sexual coercion cases and a lot of other ones too, can get a ruling quickly enough for it to matter due to the 12 week limit. Because, do note, the fact that you have a paper that says you got sexually assaulted and most likely by this-or-that person does not say, anywhere, that you got pregnant as a result of it, and you can only abort a pregnancy that was a result of an unlawful act, not one that happened at about the same time as said act. Additionally, because this is not regulated by law and uses ambiguous definitions, it's possible to get a write of reasonable suspicion of sexual coercion or other non-rape act and go with it to doctors to get some kind of proof that this is the cause of the pregnancy and get rejected because of the lack of the word “rape”; yes, this is a problem with the incompatibility between the legal and the medical definitions, as well as with doctors who reject women's claims because they are women, but the fact that this kind of thing is possible in such a dire scenario because of the lack of proper legal ruling when the same ruling exists about abortion absolutely is a problem with the law and how it's written. When there is no way to get a paternity test done before the 12 week limit and thus no way to know for certain whether it truly is a child by rape (or other such act), many doctors are afraid to help with aborting such a pregnancy unless you have some official paper that they can use to absolve themselves of guilt should someone try to get them in trouble for it, and just the writ of reasonable suspicion really won't cut it because there's no law saying that it counts as proof to them in this, which too in this case is the problem with how the law is written.

5425,"&gt;France is hoarding many space defense resources

They are also paying for them. Someone else gave a link about France paying for 84% of the Space Center activities in Kourou.

As for ""space defense"" it is mostly a national matter, the only European space related project that can be see as defense is Galileo. As for the industry, like Airbus and Arianespace, they have French companies at their roots (Airbus is a merging of French, German, British and Spanish companies) like the French Safran and most of the spending still come from France, even more than Germany and much more than UK (thank you Thatcher). Italy still control the Vega rocket and its normal, 60% of the project is paid by Italy. No one is saying Italy is hoarding Vega.

&gt;European aircraft carrier or nuclear bomb sharing

The European carrier was a dumb idea proposed by Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer in answer to Macron calling for Merkel to push for reforms of EU fiscal and migration rules, as if the French would shut up and be satisfied with a secondary pride projects that would be useless in the end anyway without a real EU military doctrine. 

Same with the nuclear sharing, he called for opening a reflexion with other EU member States about the role of the last nuclear deterrence in the EU after Brexit, not for sharing it. They aren't dumb, the deterrence works if there is only one finger on the red button.

If the idea is to have one space center in Europe, good idea. Albeit I am not sure than the Azores, deep into the Atlantic, would be better than Guiana. It is closer for sure. It is also further from the equator and doesn't claim a better weather.

If the purpose is to have a spaceport that can be used in case of conflict, if you don't want to have it as far as possible from Russia (Guiana is good then), at least remove the threat from the subs and better to keep it on the continent or nearby like Corsica or  Sicily.",,/r/europe/comments/jh9f7q/lockheed_martin_to_transfer_satellite_launch/g9yo82j/,CJprima,1603578697

It doesn't matter. Woman have to give a birth or at least give a try, no matter the circumstances. 

The social help from state/govermant for all handicapped is miserable. Of course, there are currently some promises ""we will create a fund for, we will take care of these people, women etc"". The funny thing is, similar things were said a year ago, two years ago, three years ago... What has changed? The funds for health, hospitals, medical care were cut during the recent years. Would you belive anyone from the goverment they will give a fuck about those people who will have to quit their job to take care about their child at home, buy expensive drugs so it survive the next month, seek money for a expensive surgery?

5500,"I disagree for multiple reasons. We are pretty much in an abstract moral discussion here, so I'll move a bit away from the original example.
&gt; Surviving struggle is more difficult than dying as result of it. 

I see it from a different viewpoint. Naturally dying is fairly easy in a dangerous situation, but humans will always struggle to survive by their nature (unless they are depressed). A person who died during their struggle therefore took larger risks and surviving a struggle suggests that the survivor could have pushed harder. The person who dies for an ideal is a person who put their ideal over their own life which is selfless and therefore more heroic than a person who didn't.

* The fact that the ideal was also worth more than the chance to benefit from it also carries the same notion.

From a more cynical standpoint:

* The dead are in more need of honor as they literally lost everything, while the living get to enjoy their life a bit longer. Honoring the dead also has graspable benefits. Take memorial services f.e.. They bring the living together to help deal with their grief and help seeing people in a good light.

* On a related note humans are never as good as we think they are and a human that dies doesn't get a chance to ruin his legacy. A lot of public respect, attention and power especially tends to ruin people.",,/r/europe/comments/jgvt06/french_imam_says_beheaded_teacher_is_martyr_for/g9y3j8q/,r43n,1603571092

- it's born of a resentment due to economic and political depravation in most Muslim countries,

Things get a little bit complicated with Trentino, Trentino was far more rural and for that reason the educated liberal class that was pushing for Unification was far less present,  its not clear at all what percentage of the population was actually pro joining the Italian State, but its entirely possible, and actually fairly likely, that it was not the majority. If I remember correctly, Alcide de Gasperi when trentino was still under Austria told the Kaiser, to reassure him of the Trentin fidelity, that if there was a referendum tomorrow, 90 percent of the population would vote to stay, obviously because of the circumstances that number should be taken with a bit of skepticism. What I mean is that nation-state at the time were still a new concept,  even though now we take them for granted, and there were people that  were still faithfull to the old monarchic model.


I'm not certainly sympathetic to the empire, they were really bad, they took one disastrous political decision after another and that finally led to the collapse. But there has also been a tendency by Italian historian, and not only, to judge the Austrian empire far to harshly, creating a sort of black legend around them.

5715,"&gt;Calls for a boycott of French products multiplied on Saturday in several Middle Eastern countries, after the turmoil caused by the words of President Emmanuel Macron, who promised not to ""renounce the cartoons"" of the Prophet Mohammed, which are forbidden in the Muslim religion.  
&gt;  
&gt;The French head of state spoke Thursday at a tribute to Professor Samuel Paty, beheaded by an Islamist assailant after showing his eighth-grade students drawings of Mohammed during a course on freedom of expression.  
&gt;  
&gt;Turkey, Iran, Jordan and Kuwait have denounced the publication of the cartoons of the Prophet. The Organization for Islamic Cooperation, which brings together Muslim countries, deplored ""the remarks of certain French officials \[...\] likely to harm Franco-Muslim relations.  
&gt;  
&gt;**A movement very much followed in the countries of the Gulf and the Near East**  
&gt;  
&gt;On social networks, calls to boycott French products have multiplied since Friday, through hashtags in Arabic.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Qatar, the distribution chains Al-Meera and Souq al-Baladi announced that they would ""withdraw"" French products from stores until further notice. In one of Al-Meera's stores, an AFP correspondent saw employees removing St. Dalfour brand jams from the shelves.  
&gt;  
&gt;The University of Qatar announced Friday on Twitter the postponement of the French cultural week following ""the deliberate attack on Islam and its symbols"". In Kuwait, images showing Kiri and Babybel cheeses being removed from the shelves of some stores were relayed on social networks.  
&gt;  
&gt;About sixty cooperative companies, which are major retailers in Kuwait, have announced a boycott of French products, said to AFP the vice president of the Federation of Cooperatives, Khaled al-Otaibi ""We have removed all French products, namely cheeses, creams and cosmetics from the shelves and returned them to the authorized agents of these brands in Kuwait,"" he explained.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Risks for a growing market**  
&gt;  
&gt;Some 430 travel agencies in Kuwait have also suspended reservations for flights to France, the head of the Federation of Kuwaiti travel agencies, Mohammad al-Motairi told AFP. In Jordan, the Islamic Action Front, an opposition party, called on citizens to boycott French products.

5832,"&gt; My cynical take is that any government in power of a 1st world country is ""basically evil

Well, I disagree. Sure, 1st world countries are selfish. But... not all of them bring havoc to countries like Vietnam, Iraq, Libya, put people into concentration camps or into torture camps.

So clearly some or ""eviller"" than others.

&gt; Germany certainly has one of the darkest pasts in history 

Sure... but mind two things: a) Germany was under a dictatorship. Any opposition against the government faced at least torture, often death penalty. While USA does their atrocities while claiming to be a perfectly good democracy. And b) Germany learned from this. One cannot see that the USA learned from their bad behavior.

I'd even go so far and say that BECAUSE Germany learned that war is really, really bad, we can point to countries like yours and shout to them ""Repent!"".

Another thing is...  maybe you visit [this virtual exhibition](https://ausstellungen.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/brandnacht/). It is of course in Germany, but the pictures IMHO speak by themselves. It's about the devastation of a medium sized german town, Darmstad, due to air raids in WW2. Something like this happened in almost every German town (and yes, the exhibition isn't silent about the fact that the Germany started with air-raids onto London and Coventry first). But still: this happened everywhere over here. Sure, in the 1950, when we had a big economic boom in West Germany, all of this was replaced. But people still remember that war actually isn't an answer, or a means of political influence that sane people pursue. Such a thinking hasn't arrived into the heads of numerous US americans. You simply think ""I we the best (youre not!) and we can make others be like us, even with fighters, bombers, bombs, missililes"". Few european states continued with these actions (e.g. France a bit, the UK a bit). But more or less the european states created the Montan Union, then the European Economic Union, then the European Union. This is the organization that IMHO helped more keep peace in europe for such a long period now. If you look into history, you won't find such a long period where european countries didn't fight with each other.

&gt; The USA does what it can to keep peace

No, not at all. The USA didn't invade Vietnam to keep peace. Absolutely not.

The USA didn't invade Iraq to keep peace. No idea why it invaded, perhaps a private vendetta that both Bushs had with Hussein. (Note that I don't talk about freeing Kuwait, I'm talking about invading Iraq only).

The USA didn't finance the Nicaragua death squadrons to keep peace.

The USA didn't overturn various south american governments to keep peace.

The USA didn't invade Afghanistan to keep peace. Or not only. Did you know that while Russia was in Afghanistan that your country gave weapons (including Surface-to-Air missiles) to afghan warlords?  This was never about ""keeping peace"".

The USA didn't bomb Libya to keep peace. It was a retaliation for terrist attacks, not a peace keeping mission.


&gt; with the caveat that Donald Trump continues to drag us into the dirt

This is actually funny. While I detest Trump ... I must somehow still conclude that he personally isn't that much of a war-monger than previous republican presidents. However I might not have the complete picture of his doings on this side of the great pond.

&gt; The notion that a country can truly be ""pacifist"" while reaping the benefits of a war-rich, colonizing history

Well, the wealth of Germany isn't based on a colonization age. Compared to other countries (UK, France, Brasil, Spain) we had few colonies and only for a much shorter period of time.

If you actually did what I suggested (look at a map of Germany from 1935 and 1950), you also know that we don't reap benefits from a war-rich history.

So your basic premises are already wrong --- and so you should perhaps assess if your conclusions are also wrong. There are many countries in Europe that are, more or less, now pacifist. We Germans aren't really that outstanding or special in that regard. It's the USA as the one western country that sticks out like a sore thumb actually.

Funny is, btw, that all US presidents of the last 30 years said their are christians. I guess they never read or understood Jesus' sermon on the hill. Or where he healed the soldier that lost an ear because of his followers.

5841,"&gt; I still think you need to be far more specific since you are generalising 'democracy'

There are and you're right they vary greatly, however I still think all of these Democracies stand and fall with the level of education and accessibility the Demos have on the kratos(rule).

Not all democracies need to be absolute or true, but even voting for the right representation needs education and transparency, or we end up with populist who promises Ambrosia and delivers little.

&gt;People voting is a strength, yes, but also a flaw due to exactly what you say above. They aren't mutually exclusive.

Yes people voting is a critical element, and there is such a thing as a tyrant Majority which can be very bad to the people, as the majority doesn't always vote in the publics(or even their own) best interest.

I however believe that this is a problem that can be (almost) eradicated if the the voter is well informed and conscious, not that voting cannot be a flaw but that the flaw of voting is with its voter more then the system itself(obviously many voting systems are also very deeply flawed, but not the idea of people having a vote to participate In the rule)

*So in that case someone who is against abortion wouldn't vote against abortion solely based on personal dislike and false claims and understand the intricacies of what such a ban would mean to Women, Babies, demographics etc. Leaving more focus on issues that actually affect this individual like tax rates or Housing.*

I would completely agree that my 'faith' in education and knowledge might disregard certain ideological or political identities, which just won't agree, and it's likely never going to be perfect so the Vote itself will probably always have certain flaws but this approach is the only solution I can agree on to solve Democratic flaws but still hold the essence of a Democracy alive.

You misunderstood my point -  what I'm saying is that is very uncommon for todays identities to be capable to trace a direct line through a single population from the classical-ancient history directly to them.

A fragment of our identity comes from the longboards - is their ancient history less important than the roman one in the making of the Italian identity? Because even if they assimilated many aspect of the roman culture they still have left their mark on us.


&gt; All the ancient authors also understood perfectly well the concept of Italy.

Italy have a territory uniquely shaped with clear natural borders - it's not surprise that people identify it easily since the ancient time.

But an identity isn't merely linked to a territory but also the people living on it, and it happens that a gazillion of other cultures mixed themselves by the time of the fall of the western empire to the formation of modern days italians.

Also I don't mean to be hostile when I say that you're victim of a distorted version of history created by nationalist ideas - our society as a whole is still affected by it.

5925,"&gt;  I don't know of a really strong argument not to have done that.

Deng Xiaoping famous loosely translated quote in regards to china applies here. He said ""Hide your Strength, bide your time"" 

This was working very well for them, however, Xi got _very_ much ahead of himself, and ridiculously thought china had more power than it does. Let's just get one thing straight, china is _not_ a superpower. They are however, a regional superpower. While ignoring the point a moment and sticking to the topic of superpower, you'll often hear claims that china will become a superpower by XXXX. It will not. On it's current path, china can _never_ become a superpower. Let us just look at the term for a moment:

&gt;A superpower is a state with a dominant position characterized by its extensive ability to exert influence or project power on a global scale. This is done through the combined means of economic, military, technological and cultural strength as well as diplomatic and soft power influence

Economically yes, they can meet that criteria. Militarily, perhaps. Not at the moment. They have a large military yes, but it has no experience. Even the inner workings of the military are laughable. With the one child policy the troops are also entitled (I'm not going to make this too long, but it does give a whole other mindset to combat). Technology wise, well, they're not very good at inventing anything, hence the constant banging on about ""5000 years of history"" because they have little to brag about today. Hell, even the great wall is a propaganda push, it _can not_ be seen from space, not exactly [anyway](https://www.universetoday.com/25364/can-you-see-the-great-wall-of-china-from-space/). There's a lot of stolen IP and such, but that means it's always going to be behind. Regardless, 10-20 years could be different. Still, Economically and militarily does not make one a superpower alone. 

Due to the CCP's own inner workings, their culture will never be adopted in the west. Whether you can argue this a good thing or not  isn't the point, but the west likes violence, horror etc. Too much is banned or regulated for the west or even the world to adopt. This is the same for Music (I believe rap and metal have both been targeted) video games, movies and TV. Hollywood and British movies/TV is one of the worlds biggest exports and has shaped most things. 

As for soft power, china lacks this immensely. The free world does not trust them. About ten years ago they did a very expensive soft power push, it had started to work but they fucked it up. Like everything, Xi became impatient and showed his hand far too soon. He even has pushback and anger within his own party because of it. I can't remember offhand but if I recall, they're around 36-37 or something (France 1st, UK second, Germany 3rd (I think) the US 4th) and frankly, that place is only going to drop. Their diplomacy is about as good as a Gnat high on swamp water. It consists of empty threats that the world just rolls their eyes to. 

So in a true super power sense, they will never be as they only meet one criteria, with a possibility of a second _on paper_ in about 20 years, and without any experience except losses with it's neighbours, that's more likely 30-40 years. 

So for a **TLDR** you're quite correct as there was really no strong argument for it, had they waited and not become impatient which is a repeated trait of that government (which is weird considering they have long term plans) they could have done that. Hid their strength and bided their time but they played their hand far too early and showed the world weakness instead. 

&gt;As I understand it, that may have been significant at one point, but I'm not actually sure how critical it is today. China as a whole is much economically-larger than it once was.

You're correct that by _that_ standard, it is just another chinese city, but only in GDP. It is however, one of, if not _the_ most important cities and you can not translate its importance through GDP, because it is a gateway into the other cities. Due to it's (now going and gone) freedoms, laws and autonomy it allowed for the west to treat it like a western city. Rules that would allow the west to trade unlike other cities, so they can import to HK and move the goods elsewhere, but now they stupidly fucked that up. They scream ""respect our internal affairs"" while being too dumb to realise, it's actually _British_ affairs, and hypocritically crying when other countries give them exactly what they want, treating it as just another chinese city. 

I've never known a country shoot itself in the foot _so many times_. I mean, sure, the UK did Brexit where I and others think it's a mistake (and others do not) and the US has Trump where you have two different sides, but china seems to have a trend of self goals and owning itself every other week. It's through impatience and self proclaimed importance which backfires on them, then start whining because they just embarrassed themselves.

5979,"&gt; Let's forget France and UK basically helped the king to commit a coup with the London treaty while the government and the overwhelming majority of the population was neutralist.

That is totally irrelevant. Other involved countries weren't very democratic either, and nobody polled the general population anywhere on whether they want to go to war. That can't be used to absolve Austria or Germany of the blame for the war, nor for e.g. claiming that the war wasn't popular in the UK. 

&gt; Interventism was popular among 10-20 percent of the population, Mostly educated middle classes. The wast majority of the population at the time was poor illiterate farmers who reasonably hated war since it ment death for their children and starvation for them (not enough your harms to plow).

Again, might or might not be true. In Italy, and every other country. 

&gt; irredentism was born after ww1 as a reaction to the Versailles treaty.

That's not true at all. Italy got a lot more than its own ethnic territory in the Versailles treaty, and even went on to occupy and annex territory that it didn't get in the treaty. The Versailles treaty was hugely favorable to Italy. Irredentism was caused by nationalism, imperialism and greed, not by the injustices of Versailles.",,/r/europe/comments/jh5rqo/on_24_october_1917_the_joint_austrohungarian_and/g9wit3t/,7elevenses,1603543659
