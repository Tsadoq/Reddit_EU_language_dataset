136,"After WWI the world at large silenced everything surrounding this genocide for political reasons, both the west and the newly formed USSR. Later on this took the form of consignment into oblivion of the genocide when Turkey joined NATO. Once the USSR collapsed and Armenia gained independence the geopolitical landscape changed against the need to keep a tight lid on all this. This is when you started hearing more about it, including the boom in recognitions by countries world wide starting around 1990's. 

As an example the imposed silence was so strong that no Hollywood movies were allowed on this subject, starting as early as the 1930s where Turkey led by Ataturk pressured the US to censor the production of the adaptation of Franz Werfel's Dorty Days of Musa Dagh: https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2015/04/24/epic-armenian-genocide/

Everything surrounding the destruction of the Armenian nation has been a highly relevant issue since it occurred until today within the wider Armenian nation and others who also experienced the genocide, including Assyrians and Greeks among others.

Armenians have been doing marches around the world where they were able to since around 1960's. 

The first UN speech about this was by the representative of Cyprus in 1965.

The first country recognitions was Uruguay in 1965 followed by Cyprus in 1975.

140,"I've quickly checked the figures for MBTs and combat aircraft only, using values from Wikipedia for the French [army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_French_Army#Armored_Vehicles) and [air force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Air_Force#Aircraft_inventory) and the British [army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_British_Army#Vehicles) and [air force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_United_Kingdom_military_aircraft#Royal_Air_Force), with occasional reference to pages describing specific vehicle types.

The MBTs of the French and British armies are the Leclerc and Challenger 2 respectively.  Both tanks have similar capabilities, being manufactured in the same era, with composite armour and a 120mm main gun.  (The Challenger 2 is 10-20% heavier, depending on version, which might indicate better armour.)  The French army has 222 Leclercs active and another 184 in storage.  The British army has 227 Challenger 2s active, another 48 in use for driver training, and 70 in storage.

The two armies have almost exactly the same number of operational tanks.  Both have a number of inactive tanks that could probably be recommissioned; the French army has more of these, but many of the British ones are still in use for training and so probably closer to being fully operational.  I'd call the two armies about equal on this point.

The primary combat aircraft of the French and British air forces are the Dassault Rafale and the Eurofighter Typhoon, of which they have 110 and 142 in service respectively.  These are aircraft of a similar generation, configuration and role; the Rafale is probably a bit stealthier, and the Typhoon a bit faster, but they're both canard-delta medium-weight multi-role fighter aircraft.

The French air force supplements the Rafale with 110 airframes of various versions of the Mirage 2000.  These were built in the 80s and 90s, so they're no longer front-line combat aircraft, but they're adequate for the air-to-ground role.  The British air force has no such cadre of old aircraft, but it does have 18 F-35s, with 120 more on order.  This is a cutting-edge stealth aircraft, a 5th-generation jet fighter that probably outclasses any non-US aircraft at present.

So the French air force has more total combat aircraft (220 vs 160), but they're generally older, which probably makes up for the difference in numbers, given the heavy dependence of aircraft on rapidly-changing technology.  I'd call the two air forces roughly equal at present, with the caveat that the British will probably pull ahead in the next few years as they upgrade to the F-35, unless the French air force has an equivalent upgrade planned.",,/r/europe/comments/e5eqjd/defense_spending_as_of_gdp_in_europe_for_2019/f9me1sb/,perimun,1575454107

240,"Well, it must not be very motivating to be treated like shit. So I can imagine their scores went to shit just because of that. 

And people have different ways they learn. Some are good with just learning facts, others are better at understanding and problem solving. 

Some do better bottom-up, others are more top-down. But you often don't get to choose while you are young and in school.  You often don't even know stuff like that, you just have to do with what you get.

 For example with languages I was horrible at learning grammar and just vocabulary, skip to the last years of high school which was all reading comprehension and having actual conversations, bam, went from C- to A+.  And grammar suddenly made a lot of more sense. It also really helped that the teachers suddenly liked me because of it.

 And the way stuff is teached also makes a difference. I was shit at physics, until I went to do the last couple of years of highschool in one year, so 3/4x the speed of regular high school. Without all the fluff I normally had to go through in class, which made me zone out as it was incredibly boring, and suddenly having an amazing teacher whom just showed how to do physics, it all clicked. And all of the sudden I was awesome at physics. And believe me nothing ever changed about the actual physics itself, nature's forces and the formulas stayed exactly the same.",,/r/europe/comments/e5dwtp/pisa_2018_results/f9m9eeb/,Lizzebed,1575447285

346,"You didn't show me any evidence of the predictions failing. You showed papers wondering ""Hey, in the short-term, the warming we are expecting is not happening. Where is it going?"" and these papers looked at it and said ""Oh, it is going to the oceans. It will come back from there soon enough"" and guess what, that is exactly what it did.

Nothing that you showed actually shows that IPCC predictions failed. The warming doesn't happen in a straight line, it can slow down for a moment, then jump, and so on. As long as it on the 20 to 30 year scale keeps within the predicted, the prediction is doing fine. And that is exactly what happened. 

&gt;why shouldn't the cloud coverage, sun activity, volcanic eruptions or anything else have an impact on warming?

Have you read the IPCC reports? This is exactly the sort of things they detail out in the reports. For example, we know volcanic eruptions have a massive impact on the climate in the short term, as they release aerosols. This is extremely interesting to climate scientists and they love to talk about this, instead of hiding it or ignoring it like you're implying.

Sun activity can be directly measured using satelites. It has been going down slightly over the past 30 years, so it doesn't explain the warming we are seeing.

Cloud coverage is a major reason why the climate sensitivity is not established with 100% certainity at 3C per doubling of CO2, but instead is generally estimated to have a range from 1.5 to 4.5C with 3C being the best estimate. 

In short, scientists do consider all the effects that could have an impact on warming. You forgot to mention things like changes in Earth's axial tilt and changes in albedo, which are also considered by scientists. 

When scientists say the science is settled, it doesn't mean that there isn't anything new to find out or that we know every single thing with absolute preceision. What it means is that the main points, like that the climate is warming significantly due to human activity, are extremely unlikely to be overturned by further research. Like I explained, we don't know with certainity what exactly climate sensitivity is, but we do know with almost 100% certainity that it is between 1.5C and 4.5C. 

This is common in science: For example, we know that there is a clear link between tobacco and lung cancer, even though (as far as I know) we don't really have a proper idea what is the precise mechanism that makes tobacco turn cells cancerous.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/e540wb/only_a_bunch_of_fanatics_deny_climate_change/f9m3xj5/,Aarros,1575440647

370,"Because people like you exist I have no doubt that there are bullies out there who will focus on irrelevant factors like the gender of the parents. If you are truly concerned about bullying, stop giving bullies arguments they need!

I have grown up in an orphanage. I would have been happy about any foster family because everything is better than having no family at all. Which by the way is also something bullies like to focus on as I can report from own experience.

People who claim to be concerned about the well-being of the children are disingeneous because the current situation of children who might end up in foster families with gay parents is so much worse than the kind of bullying that you think they might experience. Children will get bullied anyway. In a proper family though they have caring parents who will help them through these experiences. Growing up in an orphanage they don't even have that.

So don't run around claiming that you are concerned about the children. You give a fuck about these children. You just use this flawed argument to support your prejudices against gay people, and these prejudices are the only thing that might teach children that it is okay to bully children for having gay parents.

Besides, foster families with gay parents are not a recent fad but have existed for several decades by now in many countries, and studies haven't found any adverse effects on these children, not have they found an increase in bullying.

That is the basically the dispute we are seeing here if you don't see. Any US president would have retaliated, because a 'tech tax' was specifically created to target not only america's biggest companies but most american companies are tech based nowadays where europe's biggest companies are manufacture based.

 This situation would be like the US introducing a 'manufacture tax' created in such a way that it coincidentally  targets all big european manufacturing companies. It is honestly absurd.

404,"&gt; Yeah, tell that to the people who are SOL for services not rendered, technical issues, you name it.

If you don't want to pay ahead of time don't. Order on invoice. There's ample of online shops who will oblige, even for unknown customers.

&gt;  Easy to miss due to the time delay in the debit order cashing.

You've got ages to notice it.

See, it's simple: If you yourself ordered the transfer, it can't just be reversed. That is so that if a recipient looks at their bank statement to see if you sent them money they can trust that information. If you did not order the transfer but someone else you've got eight weeks to bounce it if you authorised the payment (e.g. because you *did* order that subscription), twelve months if you didn't (that'd be the fraud case). The transfers themselves are as fast as any other SEPA transfer, what may take longer is the withdrawer getting around to actually ordering the transfer.

I never had such a mischarge in my life. And yes I do check my bank statements, if only to have a look at what I'm spending my money on. And yes you clearly see on the statement whether it's a Lastschrift or a transaction you ordered.

&gt;  Paypal 

Maestro, Visa Debit, Paypal and yes SEPA transfers *all* are younger than the German system. In the US you still can't just wire money from one account to the other.

There's no ownership register for cars in Germany that the state could provide online services to. It's an ordinary civil sales contract, if you buy a bottle of beer in Finland will the state keep a record of who's owning it? Such a register only exists for real estate/houses as well as corporations, but not for movable objects.

If, OTOH, it's a solely private service it's not worth more, if at all, than having each other's signature down (in conjunction with checking each other's ID). In both cases you have a contract and can go to court to have it enforced.

France does not improve the economic situation, they need to let these countries develop by themselves so they can get sustainable growth and develop a proper lawmaking apparatus. One of the most basic things a country needs to make politics is control of its own economy and money. 

They don't have that because France wants to keep sucking the wealth out and funnel it to France. These countries need these do develop themselves. For every cent France gives to corrupt elites to keep their uneven treaties going, they take a dollar out. 

They are purposefully keeping them poor and many people are wise to it, if I was born in one of those places you bet I would hate the puppet government, maybe even enough to join one of the rebel groups. I can certainly understand why there is so much unrest there.

566,"&gt; Is this where Trump gets mad at other EU members and someone has to repeatedly explain how the EU works to him again? Like when he kept trying to get a trade deal with Germany.

To me, these types of statements completely miss the points. There is no question that Trump is a stupid person. But in this case he is doing something that is politically expedient and is very popular in the heartland of the US. That is, tariffs and protectionism. He basically ran on it in the Midwestern US states. He does not care about the logic or facts, because this is a political farce. It will have little real impact on the US economy or consumer, because those who buy many of these products are wealthy or at least well to do, and for them the fact that a bottle of wine went up 20-30 cents means nothing. This is symbolic, and this is how he plans to win in 2020. Not on facts or logic, but pure rage and populism. Thinking that this just his stupidity is short sighted. He has several well educated populists that believe in tariffs in his administration, and they calculate every move carefully.

I can bet 10 000$ that US won't crash out anywhere in next decade. This is simply not that case. It's obvious too anyone with basic knowledge.

&gt; I strongly doubt the US is going to lose ""just a few percents of GDP"" in that scenario.

I doubt US would loose any GDP at all. It would probably just slow down for a decade. The dollar effect is astonishing during a crisis.

&gt; Once the Pax Americana is completely dismantled and US retreat into full isolationist mode there will be less and less reasons for the rest of the world to submit to US policies and to support the dollar, especially since the US is openly using it as a weapon against the rest of the planet.

That's not going to happen, it's only a wet dream, also, nobody's subsidizing the dollar. THe last few words are jabber telling nothing about US but a lot about you.

&gt; How else do you think US can finance its humongous deficits and abyssal debt?

Oh for very long. Just like Japan, France, Canada or any other country with debt similiar or bigger than US. Even average debt in EU is bigger than US. Debt isn't an issue, especially when you got a big stick in your hand.

&gt; If anything you're more looking at an economic crisis making 1929 looks like a joke in comparison, with far-reaching and dramatic consequences for the whole planet, US very much included.

Your point was:

Of course, it does not mean that a majority of Swiss people approve. But this does not destroy direct democracy. Being a member of the EU does not destroy German parliamentary democracy either.

673,"&gt; The IPCC believes renewables cannot be done on a massive scale, hence the need to decrease energy consumption by massive amounts.

Read the damn report properly, you dolt. The median assessed pathway projects a 2x increase in electricity production by 2050 and some pathways project a 4x increase. No one reasonable shares your definition of ""massive scale"" if you don't think it applies here.

&gt; Nuclear is more doable at massive scales, which will allow to decrease energy consumption by slightly less massive amounts, this is my take.

That's a completely subjective and unfounded take and the IPCC report definitively disagrees with it. Why do you find it so hard to admit that you believe the IPCC is wrong?

&gt; As the IPCC puts it:

&gt;&gt; One  of  the reasons for this variation is that the future deployment of nuclear can  be  constrained  by  societal  preferences  assumed  in  narratives  underlying the pathways

#

&gt;&gt; One of the reasons for this variation

#

&gt;&gt; **THIS VARIATION**

What do you think this means? The IPCC assessed 50 pathways addressing below- and low-overshoot 1.5°C scenarios, and your quote provides an explanation for **THE VARIATION** between pathways regarding future nuclear shares. As I said like 3 or 4 comments ago and you deftly ignored, the most optimistic projected global share of nuclear electricity by 2050 in this scenario is 28%.

What you are saying is that even the most optimistic pathway for nuclear power is completely off the mark, based entirely on wishful thinking. Create your own damn model if you think you know so much better.

&gt; Don't forget the IPCC does not study anything. What they do is review the scientific literature. 

Congratulations! You've finally discovered what this report is after insisting the IPCC produces these models themselves. At this rate you might actually discover what the report is suggesting about renewables and nuclear power within a few weeks.

&gt; simply because nuclear is not the personal preference of researchers building these potential pathways

Ahhh, there we go! I was waiting for you to begin accusing these scientists of political bias. Why even pretend to accept the IPCC's publications when you think the models they assess are political constructs?

&gt; has three times the life expectancy of a wind turbine or solar panel

Why do you mention this as if it impacts costs? Do you think levelised cost estimates don't account for life spans?

&gt; then nuclear becomes significantly more affordable than renewables (a 100% wind turbines scenario costs about 10 to 20 times as much as a 90% nuclear-10% hydro scenario

*""In my fantasy pretend scenario renewables cost x more than nuclear""*

Good for you, but that scenario isn't at all relevant.

&gt; There's a reason why electricity has been so cheap in France compared to its neighbours in the last few decades,

Yes, because France built a ton of nuclear reactors 50-30 years ago. Why does this reduce contemporary electricity bills, you ask? Because those capex costs have already been already amortised, but you don't understand what goes into electricity bills so you pretend the actual reason is the method of production.

&gt; Nuclear is, in fact, cheap.

766,"In short, I'd say it's somewhere between 15s and 30s.

Longer explanation: 

It depends on the focal length (zoom) of the lens and the size of your camera sensor.

With a larger focal length you can keep the shutter open for less time before the stars start to streak due to the earths rotation. This has been coined the [500 Rule](https://www.lightstalking.com/500-rule/).

The way you do these pictures is you turn the aperture as wide as she goes, turn the ISO up as high as you're comfortable with on your camera and set the correct shutter speed. Then you take a series of 10 or more consecutive shots and combine them on your computer with a sky stacking tool like [Sequator](https://sites.google.com/site/sequatorglobal/) into a single image.

You can also shoot a lower ISO photo of the foreground, that is, the road, fields and the person with the torch in this photo, and combine the foreground and sky shots in a photo editing tool to get shots like this.

There are tons of great tutorials on Youtube, if you're interested in sky photography.",Latvia,/r/europe/comments/e5mey2/the_milky_way_in_valensole_france/f9kzlas/,ro4ers,1575411128

1: That's only relevant if you assume that the drug trade is going to be negotiated separately from other trade deals, which is unrealistic. There's nothing stopping the US from just saying ""if you want to get better trade terms for (insert product here), you're going to accept our terms on drug pricing, and if you don't then you'll get neither"". That's where the EU comes in. The EU has significantly more bargaining power than the UK does individually, which in turn would make it harder for America to push the UK around.

2: No, the UK will pay what the drug companies are asking, because many of these drugs are still under patent. Even for the ones that have multiple producers, they're going to take advantage of the fact that the UK is going to be arguing from a position of potential weakness. The people saying that Brexit will destroy the UK are being dramatic, but if you don't think it's going to at least hurt a bit then you're delusional.

3: First of all, inflation is a thing in every country. The gold standard's been dead for decades. More importantly, drug prices in America are *significantly* higher in America than they are in ""socialized"" countries. Hell, the prices in the US are so high that America is functionally subsidizing the rest of the world on drug prices.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/e5h08y/tory_minister_admits_us_will_be_able_to_increase/f9kzwfj/,bobdole3-2,1575411314

982,"&gt; Is that a biased reading on my behalf? I don't think so.

Let us play a game of ""true or false"".

- Most if not all IPCC scenarios rely on a MASSIVE decrease in primary energy consumption for first world countries: true or false?
- Most if not all IPCC scenarios rely on the hope that current undevelopped countries are not going to try to reach the level of energy consumption of early-21st century 1st world: true or false?
- Most if not all IPCC scenarios rely on the advancement of technologies such as carbon recapture: true or false?
- The IPCC has been developping such pathways for a while and currently, the world has never been on track with following previous pathways: true or false?

My take is not that the IPCC is wrong in claiming such scenarios would work. My take is that such scenarios will not happen because people are not willing to put up with the consequences (and also that carbon recapture is still ""fingers crossed"" which the IPCC openly admits in its report).

As the IPCC puts it in its executive summary:

&gt; Under  emissions  in  line  with  current  pledges  under  the  Paris  Agreement  (known  as  Nationally  Determined  Contributions,  or  NDCs),  global  warming  is  expected  to  surpass  1.5°C  above  pre-industrial  levels,  even  if  these  pledges  are  supplemented  with  very  challenging  increases  in  the  scale  and  ambition  of  mitigation  after  2030(high  confidence).

And **we're not even on track with those unsufficient pledges**.

Let me be clear. With or without nuclear, we're going to have to go on a massive energy diet, and the IPCC does not say otherwise. The question is how fast and how severe it will be. 

In this regard, my take is that any gram of CO2 that we can save on electricity by not using a source that requires to be supplemented by gas plants, is a gram that we will not have to save on agriculture, or in transportations, or in plastics, or in housing sizes, or any other area where CO2-free cannot be achieved.

983,"Nuclear is facing 3 big challenges:
1. Profitability
Due to high insurance and waste management and storage cost, nuclear energy is rarely profitable. 
Therefore, it has to be subsidized to even be a viable power source. This can become really costly to consumers by either inflating the electricity price or the tax bill.
Renewables are cheaper, especially in the long run.
2. Safety
Accidents rarely happen, but if they do they are devastating. 
Additionally, the radioactive waste has to be stored safely for millions of years. It is currently unknown if it is even feasible to store it safely for such a long time.
3. Acceptance
Germany has a large movement against nuclear energy. That is just an undeniable fact.

Sure I am. Hence why it was you who first brought up argument about nuclear holocaust.

Or can we just skip that nonsense and call it a mirage, and a hiding spot in order to not tell actual truth? Because believing in that opposing Russia in Ukraine and East brings forward nuclear war makes one fool, a coward, or both and I'd prefer to not think of you as any of those.

The truth is much simpler - France don't give a shit. It sees everything east of Germany as buffer. Buffer to be sold, bought, negotiated, any will do. Buffer in which borders are subject to change and negotiations as one sees fit, because its foreign policy if tailored towards Francophone Africa, Germany, UK and other things but sure as hell not East. Never was. Is not. Will not be. Unless something would change, but holy hell I really doubt that. And I know that, so do you. So don't go here telling us that we are the sheeps for allying ourselves with Uncle Sam. The Sammies may not do the things for eternal love of us, but they do care because their interest lie there for decades. And that's as good as things get for us, so we'll take it. Because you don't care and as far as you are concerned the business partnership and cooperation with Russia in foreign affairs in world sectors that you care about - especially Africa and Middle East - is simply something that pays off better for you.

So there is utterly nothing that could convince us that as just as Macron is willing to sell of the Ukraine for right price, he won't do the same for Baltics, for instance. Nada.

- Nuclear is more like 4 to 8gr.CO2 than 20, most of it coming from construction and maintenance (meaning operating the plant or not has little weight on its CO2 emmissions). 
- You also need to factor in the CO2 consumed by the renewables themselves, which are equivalent to nuclear for wind, and one order of magnitude worse for solar (again, due to construction etc., not the generation in and off itself). Peaker plants come ON TOP of that. So even if you're looking at using peaker plants one hour per year, you're already doing worse than nuclear. In fact, even without peaker plants, the sole use of solar panels in your mix makes it a less climate-friendly solution than nuclear.
- Peaker plants are not going to run only one hour a week. At all. Unless we MASSIVELY overspend on renewables, installing dozens of times more capacity than actual consumption. Just a reminder: in winter, solar can be limited to 3% of its installed capacity. Any non-windy winter day and any non-windy night whichever the season is going to require peaker plants. Peaker plants are also going to be needed when its windy-but-not-quite-enough, when it's too windy (you need to shutdown wind turbines for safety reasons), when there's not enough sun, when it's too hot (solar massively underperforms under hot temperatures, although nuclear tends to need to run at a lower capacity too in such situations to avoid warming rivers too much downhill)... you're not looking at 1hr/week of gas use, you're looking at several dozen hours a week, sometimes entire weeks. And it will usually be the weeks where the consumption is also the highest, to boots. You're at least one order of magnitude wrong on how much gas we're going to need. If you think gas companies are pushing for renewables like crazy just so they can operate their plants 50 hours per year... think again.",,/r/europe/comments/e4yrwf/nuclear_forms_part_of_climate_change_solution/f9joooe/,Ton_neveu_gauchiste,1575381699

Good thing we don't have to go 100% renewable to meet sustainable climate targets. Read the damn IPCC report on sustainable mitigation pathways.

&gt; But more importantly, if you want to tackle climate change, then no, renewables are not. Renewables are not successful at tackling climate change

1 . That's demonstrably false; Just look at the electricity emissions trend lines. 2. Read the damn IPCC report on sustainable mitigation pathways.

&gt; We don't have meaningful storage

Don't need that much.

&gt; We cannot meaningfully synchronize production with consumption

Yes you can, what do you think smart meters are for?

&gt; We don't know how to reliably maintain the network to a stable 50hz on wind and solar alone (problems start at around ~50%)

No they don't. See Denmark.

&gt; We cannot meaningfully synchronize production with consumption

Yes we can, what do you think smart meters are for?

&gt; We don't have the money to adapt the grid

Yes we do, see the hundreds of studies projecting grid integration costs with renewable shares upwards of 50%. Also, see Denmark.

&gt; That would be all fine and dandy, if gas plants did not emit TWO orders of magnitude more GHG than nuclear. Problem is: they do.

That's not actually a problem. Gas plants running at low capacity factors are perfectly compatible with sustainable development scenarios. Read the IPCC report.

&gt; If you want to tackle climate change, listen less to economists, more to engineers

See, this is a perfect demonstration of your ignorance regarding the problem. We already know nuclear and renewable electricity are low-carbon, and we already know what the production profiles of these methods are, so the discussion revolves entirely around **COSTS**. When you bring up things like grid integration costs or storage costs you are referring to **economic** problems renewables face.Nuclear engineers and renewable engineers do not have expertise that is immediately pertinent to that question, but energy economists and grid engineers **do**.

1212,"The crisis culminated in the recent massive strike by the transportation sector.

The government owned Posti, the Finnish postal service company, outsourced part of their workers into a different company in an effort to switch them to a cheaper labor union with massive pay decreases.

They went on strike, and the transportation sector formed a big sympathy strikes halting most of air traffic, busses, trucks and postal services and threatened to shut down the harbors and rails as well if the negotiations won't reach a solution. Eventually Posti backed down and reversed their decision.

The reason why it resulted in Rinne stepping down is a combination of many things in the end. First you must know that  SDP, the party of the prime minister and Sirpa Paatero, the minister responsible of the government's oversight as a stakeholder in businesses the government owns, is traditionally very close with the labor unions and even Rinne himself is a former union chief.

It's not a good look for their supporters when a company they control opposed the unions in a questionable manner. So they tried to hide it and deny that they were aware of the plans. They got called out, and Paatero already resigned last week as lying about her involvement was too much for the coalition partners. Rinne hoped he'll be able to convince the coalition partners to continue, and eventually got others to back him apart from the Center Party.

As the opposition parties are forcing a vote of confidence, the Center Party voting for no confidence would be enough to turn the vote against the Rinne government tomorrow, he decided to resign today.

The next step will probably be choosing a new prime minister from within SDP and form a new government with the same coalition and the same ministers. The new prime minister will probably be either Sanna Marin, who stepped in to cover for Rinne before the elections when he was sidelined by illness or Antti Lindtman, the leader of the SDP parliamentary group. If I had to guess, Sanna Marin probably has the upper hand.

&gt; US gained immensely from that system. 

Yes, but in terms of safety, not in economic terms. In this case they basically subsidized everyone else. Everyone with basic knowledge on geopolitics knows that. Bretton Woods was a bribe for everyone else to stay on US side strategically. It worked. It's not needed now. It's going away. Deal with it angry man. Alone.

&gt; It allowed the US to impose a world hegemony and to set an order that suited them perfectly on nearly every levels. 

Hegemony is being done for a reason, not because someone wants hegemony for hegemony itself. No, it suited them mostly on security levels, they needed to build a bloc against the soviet bloc. It suited the rest of the world that participated on all levels however. US is almost completely independent from exports outside NAFTA. Their GDP growth doesn't rely on eurasian affairs nor eurasian economy. That's pretty much basic knowledge too.

&gt; Economically it allowed them to impose the dollar as the world currency to the rest of the planet.

They didn't really impose the dollar on anyone. Dollar is a natural escape for everyone because when there's trouble in Eurasia like war or destabilization, investors know that trouble won't reach US hiding behid the ocean so everytime shit hits the fan dollar becomes more attractive, at the end making it the perfect currency to flow the capital. This mechanism was already functioning 20 years before Bretton Woods and it really happened by itself. US only regulated that fact.

&gt; If the US decides they now want to wreck their own Pax Americana

They don't need Pax Americana. They export only few percents of GDP outside NAFTA, it's the most independent economy in the world. They can practically hidde behind NAFTA politically and economically, especieally now, when they don't even depend on resource imports from outside NA. There's no purpose for it. You need Pax Americana. But daddy's not planning to stay, you're fucked and that's why you're angry.

&gt; goes all isolationist, well fine. But don't expect to keep the immense advantages that came with it.

There were strategic advantages during the cold war, but not economic ones. The strategic ones don't exist anymore. There's no reason for US to control the world oceans anymore. Yes, it's fine. But it's fine for US. The rest of the world has big troubles without US policing the world that will hit them hard as fuck.

&gt; it will continues to spin with or without the US

Of course it will, but in a much less stable way because nobody's strong enough to police everyone else like US did. You need to welcome the word war in your hearts again, because you need to take responsibility for your security now.

&gt;For François Grin, a truly open and international university education is necessarily multilingual. And this will only be possible with binding legislation.

&gt;The only discordant voice on the board is that of the representative of the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation (MISRE), Sandrine Crouzet. President Macron's desire is to promote internationalization and the Francophonie, a ""at the same time"" that has been mentioned several times, with a touch of irony by other illustrious participants in the symposium.

&gt;To make the offer of French universities attractive, the MISRE sets up funding to help university staff to better welcome foreign students and enable them to succeed.
A proactive policy in Montreal

&gt;Monique Cormier, Associate Vice-President for French Language and Francophonie at the Université de Montréal, explains that French is part of her identity. In Montreal there are two other English-speaking universities, and her university chose to teach in French because that is where it was the best.

&gt;It insists on the implementation of an offensive policy: creation of the vice-rectorate for the French language, and in 2018 inclusion in their charter of the French-speaking character of the university, ""francization"" becomes a vital part of it. The Université de Montréal is ranked in the top 200 out of 10,000 universities in the famous Shanghai ranking.

&gt;Natalie Kübler, linguist and professor at the University of Paris Diderot, expressed the same credo. For her it is absurd to offer 90% of masters degrees in English. In the name of what to ask a French teacher to teach in English to students whose English level after high school is insufficient anyway. It is also an obstacle to the success of young people from social classes who have not been able to afford refresher courses or stays abroad. But the greatest risk is that of a standardization of scientific thought.

**Africa, soon to reach 700 million French speakers by 2050**

&gt;A Cameroonian researcher, Professor Yap Boum II, an Ebola specialist, explained why he fought to have his research results published in French in the famous English medical journal ""The Lancet"". In the research centre where he works, there are several nationalities. Everyone speaks their own language. In Uganda it will be English, in Niger it will be French, but it is also necessary to translate into Wolof and Lingala so that the actors in the field can use the research results. He reminded that it will not be possible to train all African researchers in English, so it is necessary to ensure that the articles are at least summarized in the language of the field where the research was conducted.

&gt;As Canadian Esther Gaudreau of Acfas said: ""Throughout the day, the symposium highlighted the importance of rubbing shoulders with the languages of others. I think that this is what creates wealth, even if beyond that, it is conceivable that there is a common language, which is currently English, to enable researchers from all over the world to communicate together.

&gt;What does it mean to promote a French-speaking scientific space if it is not to guarantee a freedom to think differently about knowledge? All of them, in one way or another, have expressed this thought: if we give up researching science in all languages, we give up conceptual richness.

1470,"&gt; What I want to see is a tax on embedded emissions. More nuclear and more hydro power. I have no idea how this would be done because you'd be taxing EU manufacturers for carbon and also imports. You need to take away incentive to build in another country with dirty power as opposed to locally with clean power.

Simply put a carbon tax on items.

Similar to VAT, and how you can apply different VAT to different products &amp; services.

So a company importing CO2 heavy products would have to pay a tax for every item imported.

&gt;It's not European hate. I want to see Europe succeed economically. Europe has been in stagnation since 2008. If we point to Europe as an example it doesn't look good. I think the decline will really start to accelerate going forward. You need cheap power to have an economy to afford to be clean.

But that's exactly my point.

This absolutely ridiculous fantasy that we can transition to clean energy in a timely manner and still solving global warming is a pipe dream.

The cost of switching to clean energy is a short term one. It's not even really a cost at all - it's an investment.

If the EU hadn't bitten the damn bullet then we would literally be in a ""we're completely and utterly fucked"" global warming scenario. The EU singlehandedly funded the wind revolution we're currently seeing.

Do you think cheap &amp; efficient wind mills would have existed if not for the billions and billions that were put into R&amp;D and production by the EU?

1487,"&gt;  I can be wrong but to me, that means moderators stop being as active as they were (or stop being active at all).

This is partly accurate. People *do* stop being active sometimes. People have personal lives and things can change. On the other hand, we also have moderators that have never gone inactive during their time here. 

&gt;  But I don't understand why they are still moderators if so.

There are multiple reasons for it. A major reason is that we do not have a hierarchy in the team, we consider all mods to be equal. This means that we do not have a ""top mod"" that could simply watch over inactivity and remove mods at will. Each mod removal needs a majority of mods to vote in favour. We also had countless cases of inactive mods becoming active again and even the formally ""inactive"" mods are usually there if we need them. Given that mods that are added back to the team need to go through a trial period again, I guess you can understand that there is little appetite for that. There is also no reason for us to remove mods: The mod slots on reddit are unlimited and all of those on the list have been vetted and proven themselves as mods.

&gt; Moving forward, it's a bit discouraging/really don't incite me to be part of a team where most members are demotivated/aren't active anymore (as mods). 

I think every single one of our mods will assure you that we have a good working athmosphere and I cannot recall a mod going inactive over annoyance with the team. People are going inactive for two reasons mainly: Moderation work *can* be exhausting if you devote too much of your time to it. Secondly, private lives can change, meaning that you have less time for this than you once had (also works the other way around). This isn't different to any other team on reddit, no matter the number of mods on a team. 

&gt; Large team are also much more complicated to work and discuss with (both in term of 'personal workload' and for the overall decision-making process of the team), so I really don't look forward to that.

Not really. Most day-to-day decisions are taken via slack where only some of the active mods weigh in and swift decisions are possible. Major decisions are previously discussed on slack and then voted on via our backroom sub. There are voting periods (usually 48h) during which all mods that are active on reddit are notified to cast their vote, but this isn't really burdensome either.

1556,"""Buy local"" attitudes tend to be pretty strong in many places in Europe. While the top of the pyramid still drains us, it's not as bad as in the US. Lower wage EU countries could easily take up the slack, you even quoted numbers for it. 

The *real* issue here is that the upfront investment is going to be high, and anyone doing it would necessarily need to face the fact that they're not going to be getting money for nothing like they would by doing everything in China. Making electronics requires base components. If you're importing these from China, you're not doing a very good job. 

The problem with capitalist approaches today is that the rich focus on maximalising the profits to themselves. They want to offload responsibility and claim all the credit and profits. Since very few capitalists have anything resembling social responsibility, you'll naturally find a lot of resistance. And I sort of understand it, why invest many millions at a return of 10-15% into a socially needed good when you can hit somewhere with artificial scarcity and premium pricing for 100%+ returns right now? 

But perhaps we're measuring stuff wrong. Perhaps we have our priorities wrong. Of course, you could argue about strengths and weaknesses, but things in the area of electronics are very much becoming a matter of national security and they are outsourced. Besides, it is far more beneficial to the society if the profits from the production go to the workers rather than the capitalist. 

Now yes, they need money for reinvestment, but the basic trick is simple: if your workers can afford your product, you're doing it right. If they *can't*, you've just gone horribly wrong. Sure, you could argue about premium stuff and luxuries, but that's going well off the rails.",,/r/europe/comments/e4oupt/europe_needs_to_adopt_a_harder_line_on_china/f9j3uxz/,skreczok,1575355042

1570,"Well, there are two issues there.

First, an awful lot of things can harm people via one route or another.

Second, if I forego use of AI in weapons and you don't, I put myself at a disadvantage.  Normally, the way you break a situation like that is to have both sides commit to not building a weapon -- an arms control treaty.  I've not read up on any efforts in the area, but I expect that it's hard to verify that someone doesn't have AI in weapons systems.

I think that a better question is to ask what your goal is.  If it's to, say, avoid unintentional rapid escalation on both sides, you can probably deal with that via establishing some conventions as to where to have human involvement or to induce delay in the system via moving weapons systems further apart or something like that, something that doesn't involve entirely not using AI.  As long as the other side can't significantly-exploit those conventions, both sides benefit from them.

If you're aiming to deal with broader issues, like a [*Terminator*-style Skynet-goes-self-aware situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wlsd9mljiU), I'd say that that's a much broader problem than just ""don't directly give AI control of weapons"", because there would be other risks it would pose.

1609,"&gt; Yes, the attacker in London was released early after a short sentence for terrorism and there are lots of mosques which are built and owned by foreign states which are hardline islamists.

Released because of a law that has already been changed since. So yes, we are indeed tightenning things up. Also keep in mind that human justice is fallible. And if you think we will ever be able to completly prevent any and all small random attacks like this... you are going to be disappointed. Short of getting rid of every single muslims just in case, but that's not gonna happen (nor should it obviously).

&gt;Well there have been several cases where the attackers have been ""refugees"".

Probably 1 for every 9 attacks by a 2nd/3rd gen immigrants or a converted native. Migrants do bump crime statistics a bit, it's not deniable (and not especially surprising that people without much would break the law trying to get more) but not so much terrorism.

&gt;And the fact it's the 2nd and 3rd generation shows that integration of these communities have failed.

I don't know about failed. If it did failed completly, we would have a much bigger mess on our hands right now. But it can (and should) certainly be improved continuously.

&gt;Which is why we should be more cautious about who we let in or we are just going to have more of these unintegrated 2nd and 3rd generations.

1639,"&gt;Lovely State you have, I did an Exchange year 7 years back. Yes your are windy, but also true for other states that didn't invest or pioneered like Iowa. Also US have a lot of Sunny states, quite a lot of Wind potential, but barely taps into it. We have as much sun as Alaska are not that far away from US numbers.

The big reasons why there are wind here is that land is cheap because it is an agricultural state and there aren't that many people here. So the economic opportunity for building turbines is good and the demand is relatively low. As a side note I am glad you enjoyed your exchange.

&gt;Yes that's mostly hard coal. German stopped that too, but Germany has a even better and cheaper and more polluting kind of coal lignite and we have a lot. We are half the size of texas, but have the biggest deposits in the world. And It's open pit mined. That's the problem in Germany, our hard coal is also already dead.

I am not that familiar on which types of coal the US specializes in but I am pretty sure that WY, the #1 producer in the country has ""clean"" coal, to the extent that coal can be clean. However as I mentioned, demand for coal in the US has been going down for a long time and now we use about only half the amount of coal to generate electricity as we did 20 years ago. This is not good news for Wyoming, for awhile they were okay economically because they exported their coal to China but now that China is reducing coal power plant construction the mines are in big trouble. Last year production in the WY basis that supplies 40% of America's coal dropped by 1/3 and it's supposed to drop by another 1/3 this year.

&gt;sadly more to gas than to renewables, while it's an improvement, america also increased it's gas and oil production. Which is adding to US pollution.

Natural gas is significantly better than coal for electricity generation. And the pollution generated by natural gas is much lower than coal. This is largely because of fracking technology the use of which has been heavily demonized. There are areas of fracking that need to be better regulated, specifically methane emissions from production sites and wastewater injection deep into the earth (which can cause earthquakes). That being said the production of natural gas from fracking is better than digging and burning coal.

&gt;Yes Germany is also still over 11%, but the shutdown 2021 will be interesting. We mainly have them in North, where there is no problem shutting them down, but the South is still lacking renewable, so either powerlines to the South must be done, or Bavaria and Ba-WÜ need more wind they are pretty of due various reason or more, solar which is more profitable.

Depending on who wins the elections next year (both regional and federal) we will see a shift in how America generates electricity. Especially as the nuclear plants reach the end of their life. Many states like CA have already mandated strict low carbon regulations. This is important because CA is not only the largest state, but imports a large amount of power from other states so how CA goes affects many of the western states like UT who supply electricity to CA.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/e4j6hi/live_co2_emissions_in_europe_now_source/f9ix53p/,thenuke777,1575348398

This is part of my reason for believing that the U.K. doesn’t have a problem with overall levels of immigration but rather with the spread of immigrants and the perception that results from that. For example, I come from a predominantly white middle class community so from my perspective it appears we don’t have many immigrants. However, someone from a diverse community in a town like Bradford for example will see something very different to me on a daily basis and that will affect their perception of our country’s immigration levels.

Of course we can’t force new immigrants to move to certain towns/cities just because there are too many of their compatriots there but maybe we can offer incentives for such people to encourage them to spread out more thinly across the country instead of gathering all together in small areas and causing drastic changes to the demographics of such areas.",,/r/europe/comments/e51xjq/denmark_wants_to_break_up_ethnic_enclaves_what_is/f9ixcus/,Magitechnitive,1575348580

When the EU targeted the likes of Netflix, it crossed a red line for me because Netflix already does a lot of good work in the EU that it didnt have to do. It's a for profit business but it's one of the best for profits out there and most actors, directors, producers love to work with them, few complaints (there are complaints, just not many). 

A lot of these taxes are aimed at targeting mostly US tech firms rather they're from the EU or France in particular with the hope of giving domestic tech firms a better shot at actually succeeding. Basically they're shooting the likes of Netflix, Disney, Google in the foot over and over again while running a race without shooting European companies in the foot just the same. 

The US wont do the same though because for example European tech firms are tiny in comparison to American ones, so the pain felt wouldn't be the same if you had France vs US or EU vs US but they could target other industries instead that'd exact a similar tax, make it law, make it seem just - just like what Brussels does here and then scoff at them when they complain.

1762,"&gt; I'm not even arguing with you about global warming. I'm talking about accounting and sweeping stuff under rug. It's something that is done but doesn't fit the narrative of China is all bad, and America is bad.

Nothing is swept under the rug. We simply chose to go with a production based CO2 calculation because that's what is within the control of each nation.

The EU cannot dictate how energy standards are in the US, nor can it dictate how they are in China - and vice versa.

&gt;When you include Embedded Emissions (This is already being calculated, it's not that is too hard):
Germany: 10% higher, France 30% higher, UK 40%, I believe this have only gotten worse from 2016.
America: 7% higher.
China: 14% LOWER.
https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions 

You're right, let's look at that instead.

* US: 17.75 tons/capita
* Germany: 10.84 tons/capita
* UK: 8.46 tons/capita
* France: 6.93 tons/capita
* Spain: 6.21 tons/capita

The numbers are pretty clear.

But please ... tell me how bad the EU is for exporting their production. Really, I want to hear it. And please conveniently ignore how much worse your own country is while complaining about others that actually try.

Maybe you think per capita is unfair? So let's look at total levels of consumption based CO2 output:

1990 levels:

* US 5.1 billion tons
* UK 0.65 billion tons
* Germany 1.16 billion tons
* France 0.49 billion tons
* Spain 0.26 billion tons

2016 levels:

* US 5.72 billion tons
* UK 0.55 billion tons
* Germany 0.87 billion tons
* France 0.45 billion tons
* Spain 0.28 billion tons

My, what a surprise? It's also lower ... Who would have ever guessed?

&gt;You've said 2019 would be low 1990 target? It's expected to drop at least another 2%

That's fantastic. I just read up on it and it seems that in January the report it was expected the US would drop by 2.2% in 2019 - after rising by 2.7% in 2018.

I hope that actually remains true.

I'm not sure how that works out if you factor in consumption based CO2 - which you were oh so very intent on doing.

&gt;and Europe has been stagnant for years.

Except Germany is expected to see CO2 output drop by 4% in 2019. They are within reach of their goal of reducing CO2 output by 40% compared to 1990 levels (at the end of 2018 they had reached a reduction of 31%)

And that's the glaring fucking difference between Western Europe and the US - the ambition and goals of actually doing something to combat global warming.

In the US you're literally still having fights about whether global warming is real. Your own fucking idiot president is saying it's a hoax.

We've had scientific proof that it's real and it's caused by us since the 50s, and 100% proof since the 60s - and you're still fucking debating it like utter morons.

&gt;Okay the Nuclear thing isn't just about evil fossil fuel industry. Even places like greenpeace don't want Nuclear power. Germany had great Nuclear power and it stopped. https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/issues/nuclear/

I totally agree. However I'm not sure why you're so focused on the EU in this regard.

The EU produces just above 25% if it's electricity from nuclear.

The US produces 19%.

Why are you so fucking intent on hating on everything the EU does - while defending the US performing worse in every metric?

1774,"&gt; German Energiewende spending which consists mostly of debt repayments from when renewables were 10x more expensive than they are today, is not actually pertinent to the question of whether new renewables or new nuclear plants are more competitive today.

That is simply wrong. The cost for going 100% renewables are astronomical. One study gives the number of 3000 billions (!!!) for Germany. And that's *if* we tackle the various technical challenges around intermittency and storage *at all*, which is currently not a thing we know how to do.

&gt; If France and Sweden did not have their nuclear fleets and could spend what Germany is currently currently spensding on renewables, they would be better off spending that on renewables.

If you want to make a quick buck off energy that you then cannot reliably use, then yes, spending money on renewables right now is a good idea. You can install a few wind turbines, gain a few more percents of the nation's production on renewables, make money and claim you're saving the world. [Economically-speaking, the problem rises when you want to go further than that](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/03/27/if-solar-and-wind-are-so-cheap-why-are-they-making-electricity-so-expensive/).

But more importantly, if you want to tackle climate change, then no, renewables are not. Renewables are not successful at tackling climate change in the various countries where they are being heavily introduced, simply because, on top of economical factors, there are technical factors that you need to take care of, and which we don't know how to take care of right now.

- We don't have meaningful storage
- We cannot meaningfully synchronize production with consumption
- We don't know how to reliably maintain the network to a stable 50hz on wind and solar alone (problems start at around ~50%)
- We don't have the money to adapt the grid (all the low prices of renewables you see are without factoring in the cost of adapting the grid to such technologies - that cost is a **massive** part of the total cost of renewables, and it increases **exponentially** as you increase the percentage of your energy coming from renewables).

So what do we do to circumvent these problems? Basically, we add gas plants which can take over when there's too little sun or too little wind for the current level of energy consumption. Not just one or two. We need to have enough of them to basically fulfill 100% of our needs. Because many times a year, the actual amount of energy generated by solar and wind is basically zero.

That would be all fine and dandy, if gas plants did not emit TWO orders of magnitude more GHG than nuclear. Problem is: they are.

If you want to make a quick buck, then yes, by all mean, go on, install a dozen turbines. You can even make double that money by also installing a gas plant which you know full well is absolutely necessary.

If you want to generate as little CO2 as Sweden and France however, every country currently trying to do that on new renewables is failing, and failing HARD.

1816,"You cannot have a system that is 100% solar/wind. You will need baseline, steady electricity on the grid. You cannot have many fluctuations inside the grid or it will collapse. 

There are two big problems to solve. Too low power levels -&gt; grid failure - need help from coal/fossil fuel plants (fast to start up, need to be up and running in matter of minutes/hours, this is the reality where we live in).

Another one is too much power -&gt; burn up your grid, in the US, there have been cases that (Florida?) Had to pay other states to take their electricity to reduce power levels. They paid a lot, but saved their grid.

There is no possibility to rely 100% on wind/solar even if we had a battery big enough for two whole days of our energy need for everyone here, because it can be -30°C or more. What then, when sun is blocked, no wind and it's still freezing? Still simply isn't an option.

With nuclear we could solve all this, get rid of Soviet-era nuclear energy (we buy lots of electricity from Russia, because we are not self-sustained) and build our own, modern and safe, nuclear reactors. We even have the nuclear waste under control with our underground cave project! 

Nuclear can be THE answer for our energy needs under good managment.

If a country is in trouble it can ask for help. If a country is deemed uncontrolled, the united nations can intervene with many peace-keeping armies.

&gt; The problem is California alone would be the world’s 7th largest economy if it were independent.

Current economic models don't really measure arms production capacity that well, like they used to in the past. Also the great economic power of California is extremely dependent on politics. If the EU becomes protectionist like China, overnight Google's value (and all the tech companies) goes down by at least 30%.

Also a lot of California's economy depends on China's goodwill. All Intel and AMD CPUs are made in China. All iphones as well.

Politically, I don't think China would have extreme issues finding 10 million males to send to battle. Russia would probably find a few million as well. In the US I think it'd be really hard/expensive to convince that many people to fight for their country.

2012,"Yes I have basically brought up the first definition ~~Google~~ Oxford gave me. And I'm aware of UN definition of genocide is different from this. Based on the UN's definition Ottoman's Armenian ""Genocide"" is not a genocide. How you ask? They started an uprising (Also cooperated with Russian army at WWI and French army at the time of War of Indepence), Ottoman Empire exiled them. Yes civilians were also exiled, yes we made them leave their homes, yes many of them starved or froze to death or died from diseases while trying to leave, yes uprisers were killed (literally what do you expect? Telling them to drop their weapons until they do it?). Civilian deaths are mainly because of Ottoman empire was in a decline and in war at the same time. What do you expect from an empire that is about collapse? They wanted to end this uprising fast and focus on the war so they didn't really tried to be careful about who they were exiling. 

This wasn't only with Armenians IE there were also Turkish organizations that forced Empire to surrender to Allies so Empire could ""survive"", Arabs that revolted etc. got exiled many of them died in similar ways because Empire was trying to focus on the war instead of trying to deal with them, uprising need to be suppressed fast so exiling process wasn't something that Empire tried to be careful about.

Also you are saying these are not much of a big deal compared to a ""genocide"" because these aren't genocides? That's pretty stupid tbh. 

Also Algerian Genocide isn't recognized as a ""genocide"".Also, one more thing: the ""Armenian Genocide"" issue isn't about the current government  or president, not a single opposition party recognizes it. So don't be so happy about this topic if the opposition wins the next election because they will probably win.

Also the main issue with it wasn't about an argument about a genocide exists or not.

2177,"Non–aggression pacts were signed with
the Soviet Union in 1932 and with Hitler’s Germany in 1934. Polish
dependence on Western goodwill was seen as a sign of weakness
and the links with France and French interests in Eastern Europe,
formalized in a Treaty of Friendship in 1921, were deliberately
attenuated. Poland distanced herself from the League of Nations.

Poland counted herself among the revisionist powers, with dreams of a
southward advance, even a Polish presence on the Black Sea. The
victim of the revisionist claims of others, she did not see the Versailles
frontiers as fixed either.

Polish pursuit of an independent line led not to greater power, but to isolation.
It was at this point that Danzig re–entered the European stage.

Of all the new states created at Versailles, Poland was
almost certainly the most disliked and her.Foreign Minister the most
distrusted. Poland’s pursuit of an independent line left her bereft of
any close friends by the end of 1938; to the outside world, Germany
seemed the closest. The Western powers saw Poland as a greedy
revisionist power, illiberal, anti–Semitic, pro–German; Beck was ‘a
menace’, ‘arrogant and treacherous’.16 The West, anxious enough
to avoid war themselves at Munich by giving away the Sudetenland,
pilloried Poland for taking her share of the spoils. The French Prime
Minister, Daladier, told the American ambassador in Paris that ‘he
hoped to live long enough to pay Poland for her cormorant attitude
in the present crisis by proposing a new partition …’.17 British
diplomats attributed Poland’s delusions of grandeur to the fact that
Beck was ‘full of vanity’, consumed with ‘ambition to pose as a
leading statesman’. The Polish ambassadors in London and Paris
found after Munich that their hosts were ‘cold and hostile’, showing
‘such obvious ill–will’ that prospects of support in the face of German
power seemed remote. The French ambassador to Warsaw, Leon
Noel, advised Paris in October 1938 to terminate once and for all
any remaining agreements with Poland.18",EU-UK-FR,/r/europe/comments/e4p23d/poland_to_intervene_over_polish_child_being/f9h71dh/,nosoter,1575310155

That doesn't mean there's not room for innovation. Most plants haven't changed much in design in decades which is crazy. Nuclear still should be a pillar of our fight against climate change. Unless energy transmission or battery storage gets a breakthrough innovation, they can't carry the load on their own.

Have you read about Bill Gates' venture Terrapower at all? He's been quietly funding new nuclear plant designs for the past decade+. Seems like they've solved a lot of the concerns people have about nuclear. They use spent fuel as the main resource so enriched uranium isn't as much of a problem (and would be a good use for the spent material we're talking about here). They also use liquid metal as a coolant instead of water so the meltdown scenarios where the water has evaporated isn't going to happen in the same way like Fukushima did.

As this gift ran counter to the will of the Swedish government, and no flight permit had been given, it resulted in Kindberg receiving a fine of 100 [Swedish crowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Krona) for leaving the country without permission. This aircraft is considered by some to be the first aircraft of the Finnish Air Force, since the Finnish Air Force did not officially exist during the Civil War, and it was only the *Red* side who flew a few aircraft with the help of some Russian pilots. The von Rosen aircraft was given the designation F.1.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Air_Force#cite_note-keskinen-2) The Finnish Air Force is one of the oldest air forces of the world – the [RAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force) was founded as the first independent branch on 1 April 1918 and the Swedish [*Flygvapnet*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Air_Force) on 1 July 1926.

  &gt;Von Rosen had painted his personal good luck charm on the Thulin Typ D aircraft. This charm – a blue swastika, the ancient symbol of the sun and good luck – was adopted as the insignia of the Finnish Air Force. The white circular background was created when the Finns tried to paint over the advertisement from the Thulin air academy. The swastika was officially taken into use after an order by Commander-in-Chief C. G. E. Mannerheim on 18 March **1918**.

2382,"From an award-winning Soviet book about Finland (Veter s juga, 1946):

“There were two neighbors. The other one, who was big, happy and kind, tried every day to meet the one who was gloomy and silent. He always nodded his head to him and tried to shake his hands. But this one just stayed silent and looked angry. The neighbor didn't get irritated, politely he smiled every morning and tried to shake hands, but the another one didn't even lift a finger. 

Finally, he lost his patience. Who wouldn't lost if something like that would continue for years. So, this neighbor become so angry that he hit his neighbor's head with a stick. He did hit, and surprised even himself by doing so. Something cracked down from the neighbor. No, it wasn't his head that cracked open, it was a hard ice cover which had freezed him like that. That's why he couldn't nod his head or shake hands. But now that the ice cover broke, he stepped out like a real human being, smiled and wanted to shake his neighbor’s hand. He of course shook happily back. 

Soon come clear that they were quite similar. They were both adults, kind, pug-nosed, and fair-haired, just like two brothers, and they didn't know any reasons why they shouldn't shake each other’s hands. Good thing that the neighbor hit with the stick.”

[The future president Kekkonen](https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/10665/TMP.objres.2985.html?sequence=1) didn’t probably know should he laugh or cry when he read this.

2554,"&gt;Sad thing is I've defended Merkel for years, now I cant stand her and it's all to do with Huawei, ZTE and how extreme the threats are from China for diplomatic and trade relations if she does formally block them. Meanwhile Trumptard is the only person in the world taking an actual stand against them. It's sad when a man like that that's so vial is the only 'adult' in the room when it comes to these extreme threats.

Trump is the prime reason why China can encroach on half the world unmolested. Instead of providing a unified front, he alienated his allies. First thing he did in office was stepping back from a trade agreement and leaving a void that China was all to eager to fill. While the world looks at Trump tweet, China encroaches on Africa, buys power in Australia, secures trading routes all over the pacific, isolates India to ensure dominance in Asia and buys favors in Europe.

Now he takes a stand by imposing tariffs. What does China do? They transport their Huawei phones to one of their new-bought friends, put in the last chip and ship it to America tariff free. The oldest trick in the book.

Merkel on the other hand is being pragmatic. If she were to openly oppose China in any way, then she wouldn't get anywhere. The Portuguese and Greek would veto anything that is going to damage China, as they have before, because they're already deep in Xi's pocket. What she does instead is appeal to other European countries to agree on one course and obscures her parties preferences behind regulations and safety standards.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/e4oupt/europe_needs_to_adopt_a_harder_line_on_china/f9fo82y/,Gringos,1575281552

Never. They didn't stop interfering in elections and they will not do so. They will not withdraw troops from Ukraine, they will not return Crimea, they will not do anything.

2724,"Joe Miller in Frankfurt and Peter Campbell in London 
Two weeks ago a bumper crowd of restructuring experts flocked to the swanky environs of Frankfurt’s Villa Kennedy hotel, their sights firmly set on the casualties of the crisis sweeping the German car industry.

Days later, Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler and Volkswagen’s Audi brand announced more than 20,000 job losses, in the first real signs of the huge human cost of the sector’s transition from combustion engines to electric vehicles.
“The auto industry is in the midst of a far-reaching upheaval,” said Volkswagen chief executive Herbert Diess, whose company is seeking to reinvent itself as a world leader in battery-powered cars.

“No one will survive in the form they exist today,” predicted Ralf Kalmbach at consultancy Bain &amp; Co, who has spent 32 years advising German carmakers.
The enormous expense of this transformation, he added, has left the engine of the country’s postwar Wirtschaftswunder, or economic miracle, facing the “biggest crisis since the invention of the automobile” by Karl Benz more than a century ago.

It is estimated that the German car industry, which directly employs 830,000 people and supports a further 2m in the wider economy, will be forced to plough some €40bn into battery-powered technologies over the next three years.
“We have seen the first few chapters of the transformation, but this is a book with many chapters,” warned Ola Källenius, Daimler chief executive, last month, as he confirmed the carmaker would post significantly lower profits for at least two years.
German auto giants, from Daimler and Audi to suppliers including Continental and Bosch, have announced that around 50,000 job will be lost or are at risk so far this year, as their traditional businesses become less profitable. 

The global economic slowdown, exacerbated by the US-China trade war and the risk of Brexit, has forced manufacturers to revise heady sales projections.
They had expected to sell in excess of 100m vehicles in 2019. With just a few weeks left in the year, that figure is likely to be more like 90m. 
Increasingly localised production by the carmakers in China and North America to avoid tariffs has also sapped the exporting power of German-based plants, which are left catering to the more fragile European market.

To make matters worse, a demographic time bomb is ticking, which could permanently reduce the number of new car buyers, and a new raft of competitors, including the likes of Uber and Google’s Waymo, are emerging with products such as autonomous cars that will probably drive the future of transport.
“The German auto industry needs to learn to adapt faster, to change faster,” warned auto analyst Arndt Ellinghorst at Evercore ISI.
Despite these warnings, the premium carmakers have been reluctant to go “all-in” on electric technology, at the risk of alienating existing engine-loving customers.

With the electric car market still in its infancy, Daimler’s Mr Kallenius told investors that the Mercedes-owner would “not develop technology for the sake of technology”.
BMW, similarly, has been keen to play-up its traditional expertise. 
“We believe there is still much room for growth in the automotive sector,” BMW’s chief executive Oliver Zipse said, dismissing the earnings potential of so-called mobility services, such as car sharing and self-driving taxis.
“There is a long-term growing demand for individual mobility worldwide, especially in the premium segment. The fundamentals behind it are much stronger than the current dip in the overall market, which is mainly due to economic slowdown.”
Their confidence, however, jars with the impending bloodletting in the country’s powerhouse sector.

In the next decade, almost a quarter of a million auto jobs will be lost in the country, according to Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, the director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen. Smaller suppliers, such as paint shop Eisenmann, have gone out of business.
Car sales in China, which helped Germany’s biggest brands weather the financial crisis, have slowed for 17 months in a row, drastically reducing a key source of revenue at the precise moment it is needed to fund new technologies.
“We have kind of the worst situation now,” Mr Källenius told investors two weeks ago. “We have got to do the heavy lifting in the next three years.”
Despite widespread anxiety in the industry about the lack of demand for electric vehicles, strict EU carbon-emissions rules are forcing carmakers to accelerate their production plans, or face billions of euros in fines from Brussels. 

The EU’s targets for 2030 can mean that between 7m to 10.5m battery-powered cars will have to be on Germany’s roads by the end of the next decade.
Volkswagen, whose first mass-market battery-powered hatchback, the ID3, is rolling off production lines in east Germany, is “convinced that the transition to electric-mobility will gain traction next year,” according to VW’s Mr Diess. 

As he announced plans last month to build a further 4m battery-powered vehicles, Mr Diess was adamant that “electrification is not a gamble”. But he warned that “the conversion to e-mobility requires resources,” which must be financed from VW’s “traditional businesses”.
While the world’s largest carmaker does enough of such business to absorb the investment costs of converting entire combustion engine car plants to zero-emission production, Germany’s premium manufacturers, Daimler and BMW, do not.
“For the moment, you have to consider that with every electric vehicle, manufacturers are losing a tremendous amount of money,” said Mr Kalmbach at Bain. That is not expected to change until the middle of the next decade.

A heavy reliance on the sales of profitable luxury cars has left executives with little room for manoeuvre.
“We had a couple of good years and the necessary work of applying cost discipline has not been done,” Mr Kalmbach added. “Companies added fat to their waists.”
VW managed to convert its factory in the east German city of Zwickau without any job losses, and Porsche created 1,500 new roles to build its new Tesla rival, the Taycan, in Stuttgart.
The unique strength of German labour unions has forced Daimler and Audi to provide job guarantees, which stretch to the end of the next decade, while VW’s supervisory board is dominated by its powerful workers’ representatives and local politicians, who would stand in the way of mass redundancies.

The cost of shedding jobs in Germany, often estimated at €100,000 per axed position, forces companies to consider reskilling programmes or wait for employees to retire.
Yet even the German car lobby, the VDA, predicts that the shift to electric cars will cause 70,000 jobs to go in the near future, as their assembly is far less labour intensive, and their components have fewer moving parts than combustion engine models. 
“Even during the financial crisis, there were hardly any lay-offs because of agreements with labour unions,” said Capgemini’s Rainer Mehl. “As this crisis gets tougher, there will probably be a need for deeper cuts.”
It seems Germany’s flagship brands are merely putting off the inevitable.
This is because they are still too profitable for widespread cuts to be politically palpable, said Max Warburton, a veteran auto analyst at Bernstein.

“In this industry you can only cut jobs in a crisis,” he added. “Deep down, they all know that. They all know they’re going to have to, they are just trying to postpone the day of reckoning.”
Instead, large carmakers are putting pressure on their suppliers, which are drastically reducing their headcount to remain competitive. 
Continental is doing away with 3,570 positions in Germany alone, while Bosch will slash thousands of jobs in the next two years, and employees at ZF have been protesting against looming cuts. The market for petrol and diesel engine components will decline at 7 per cent a year, according to a recent McKinsey study.

“The times are getting tougher, but this industry has always stood up to the competition and it has the necessary flexibility, determination and knowhow to withstand crises,” said Bernhard Mattes, the outgoing president of the VDA.
The engineering expertise that has helped Germany’s carmakers survive for 130 years would carry them through the tsunami of disruption that looms on the horizon, he added.
“We have no reason to be despondent. It isn’t the makers of vacuum cleaners, the postmen or the high-tech firms that launch innovative vehicles on to the market . . . The German auto industry will become a pioneer.”",Lake Bled connoisseur,/r/europe/comments/e4uvnd/german_car_industry_faces_day_of_reckoning_tens/f9fdkqe/,MelodicBerries,1575267517

It's racist because it ignores far bigger problems a lot of which the developed world has at least some culpability in and puts all the blame on ""poor uneducated simpletons"", which they really aren't. Colonialism, neocolonialism, dictators the west was happy to work with while they served a purpose, wars to remove said dictators when they weren't, climate change, etc. Saying that Syrians, Libians, Afghanis, Iraqis, Ukranians, Tunisians really need more education is a cheap cop out, and worse, it's blaming the victim.

Libya for one had a better human development index than most south American countries, better than Russia and on par with or better than East European countries until the war.

The only reason the Taliban were ever in power was they served a purpose in fighting the Soviets during the cold war and the US found this useful enough to fund, equip and ignore after the war was over, just sort of leave it there to fester and forget about it. Sadam Hussein was very useful when he was fighting Iran for the better part of the 1980s. Problem was that this cost much more money than he could hope to make up (having less oil reserves than Iran, which was a big part of the reasoning behind attacking Iran) so he decided to invade Kuwait to make up some of the losses, thinking his buddies in the West would back him up. US and EU policy at times has a disastrous effect on places they interact with, these are jus the most recent and glaring examples.

2808,"As in, ""there are immigrants and people don't like it?""

Yeah.  If immigration stopped, far right parties would probably go away.

But if there *aren't* immigrants, then at current fertility rates, the country's population starts falling quickly and that creates a ton of problems.  Pensioners don't get their pensions, real estate values -- and with it, people's accumulated wealth -- collapse, the economic/military/political influence of the country/union/continent drops, taxes on the young rise and make it more-appealing to leave (worsening the situation).

So getting fertility rates up would also be a fix.  However, what parties have tried so far have not worked.  It is definitely harder than it might initially seem to get people to have more children.

I've linked this a couple times recently, as I was watching it for the religious side of the situation, but it's got some pithy quotes on demography that summarize points that I have regularly made on here:

[YouTube: Why the religious will inherit the earth (p1). Eric Kaufmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYEyv5a_3LM)

&gt;  There are about 35 countries that are at a TFR -- total fertility rate -- of 1.3 or below in the world and it's proven extremely difficult for governments in Southern and Eastern Europe and in East Asia where fertility rates are at these very low rates to get those rates up.  They've been throwing money -- baby bonuses, all kinds of tinkering with social policies -- but it's very difficult to get those total fertility rates up.

Now, I will believe that there is some as-yet-unfound way to get people to have more kids.  But to this day, countries haven't discovered a politically-sellable-to-the-public-as-a-whole, financially-practical way to get a public that's fallen well below replacement rate fertility to get back up to that level.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/e4g8ho/germany_thousands_of_migrants_return_after/f9f5ho8/,duisThias,1575260091

3053,"you'd see stabbing numbers go way down.


But more seriously, I saw a lot of pictures of British men with submachine guns associated with this story, walking around London Bridge extremely heavily armed. Guns are INSEPARABLE from England, don't live under some illusion that you're in a gun-free state. The key point here is that some citizens are deemed responsible enough to have the means of defense, and most are not. Those police are not magically better at morality than the average citizen, but that is the reality that you choose to believe, your life is not worth as much. 


In places with a culture/tradition/whatever you want to call it that accepts firearms as tools, the statistics completely come down to economics. Violent cities with economic problems are violent with whatever tools are at hand, peaceful cities are peaceful, regardless of the tools at hand. The guns have zero impact on the numbers of violence. But they do allow people who are physically inferior to attackers to have a chance of self defense if they don't have a fucking narwhal handy.


Mass shootings are unicorns in firearms violence statistics. US numbers are high because of reporting methods (if more than 2 people are in the area, it's a mass shooting. If it's near a school, it's a school shooting etc.) They are multiplied by the media because it behooves them to boost ratings with splashy stories. A lot more buses kill people, but we don't debate banning buses and think of them as monster-machines. A bus death is not interesting to run with, to delve into.

3076,"&gt;The problem is down to Turkey’s policy of “visa diplomacy”, under which its Islamist government has sought influence across Africa and the Middle East, by easing visa restrictions. Citizens of countries such as Somalia, Eritrea, Afghanistan and Sudan can all get “e-visas”, which require only a form to be filled in and a fee to be paid online.   
&gt;  
&gt;Those applying for an e-visa from countries considered a source of illegal immigration should have extra documents, such as a residency permit for the Schengen countries. However, there is no online process for verifying the documents.  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead, this should be done on arrival in Turkey, but the Frontex report says the [**authorities often do little**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/11652970/Illegal-immigrants-routes-to-UK-map.html) beyond checking that applicants are not already blacklisted for security reasons.  
&gt;  
&gt;A condition of the e-visa regime is that applicants use airlines that have “signed a protocol with the Turkish foreign ministry”, which means either Turkish Airlines or Pegasus Airlines, a private low-cost carrier. Both have expanded hugely in recent years, with Turkish Airlines flying to nearly everywhere in the Islamic world, including Somalia.   
&gt;  
&gt;Last week, a Telegraph reporter pretending to be from Afghanistan was able to buy such a visa in less than five minutes.  
&gt;  
&gt;On a recent visit to Greece, The Telegraph met a number of Africans who had crossed into Europe after flying into Turkey. Patrique Kitokou, 23, from Congo, flew from Kinshasa to Istanbul two years ago. He crossed to the Greek islands on a people-smuggling vessel. “I paid $1,850 for the plane ticket to Istanbul,” he said.

&amp;#x200B;

Turkey attracts potential illegal immigrants from Africa and the Middle East with a specially designed e-visa program that's extremely cheap and without checks. **It even uses low cost airlines for this program.**

People who would have to cross 4 or 5 or even more countries to reach Greece, **paying smugglers multiple times to cross borders**, they only have to get the e-visa in a very low price and pay Turkish traffickers once in order to cross to the Greek islands.

That's it. They have succeeded to reach Europe. Deportations back to Turkey are extremely rare. Of course the chances are high that these people won't make to Germany or other European countries any more. They usually get stuck in Greece.",,/r/europe/comments/e4g8ho/germany_thousands_of_migrants_return_after/f9encae/,TravellingAroundMan,1575246954

3123,"Not so much bullshit - the JNA was plagued with problems when fighting began: organizational, morale and manpower issues, poor co-ordination with paramilitaries and local units, not to mention that their military doctrine was based on defensive total war rather than the offensive stance they found themselves in. This may have worked in areas where you already had an armed local Serb population in place, but elsewhere they found themselves grinding to a halt.

The Battle of the Barracks also changed the situation, since any tactical advantage they had by being deep within Croatia was lost - their only option now was a tedious push west, which proved much more complex than initially thought. By this stage the advantage in numbers and hardware was also diluted - ultimately they found themselves overextended and on the back foot, as Croat forces began to make gains before the ceasefire of 1992.

Of course had things been planned, timed and executed differently, the end result may have been different (no doubt at significant cost). But given what transpired, it comes down to their own shortcomings and hubris rather than any dealings between Milosevic and Tudman.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/e45u0b/the_jnas_strategic_offensive_plan_in_croatia_1991/f9dzpyr/,the_bulgefuler,1575238328

3152,"&gt; Paris, London and Berlin on Saturday welcomed six new European countries to the Instex barter mechanism, which is designed to circumvent US sanctions against trade with Iran by avoiding use of the dollar.

&gt; “As founding shareholders of the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (Instex), France, Germany and the United Kingdom warmly welcome the decision taken by the governments of Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, to join Instex as shareholders,” the three said in a joint statement.

&gt; The Paris-based Instex functions as a clearing house that allows Iran to continue to sell oil and import other products or services in exchange.

&gt; The system has not yet enabled any transactions.

&gt; Washington in 2018 unilaterally withdrew from the international agreement governing Iran’s nuclear programme and reinstated heavy sanctions against Tehran.

&gt; The addition of the six new members “further strengthens Instex and demonstrates European efforts to facilitate legitimate trade between Europe and Iran,” the joint statement said.

&gt; It represents “a clear expression of our continuing commitment to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action” – the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal – the trio added.

&gt; They insisted Iran must return to full compliance with its commitments under the deal “without delay”.

&gt; “We remain fully committed to pursuing our efforts towards a diplomatic resolution within the framework of the JCPoA.”

&gt; The 2015 deal set out the terms under which Iran would restrict its nuclear programme to civilian use in exchange for the lifting of Western sanctions.

&gt; Since the US pullout, Iran has taken four steps back from the accord.

&gt; The latest was on 4 November, when its engineers began feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into mothballed enrichment centrifuges at the underground Fordow plant south of Tehran.",,/r/europe/comments/e4ouhr/six_more_countries_join_trumpbusting_iran_barter/f9e1qzr/,bataneyelid,1575238841

3277,"&gt; 90% of people will never revolt on anything.   
&gt;  
&gt; If Tommoror Germany took over Netherlands- (barring politics) the average Dutch person will be German.

I think you are severely underestimating the power nationalism still holds in modern Europe and the spite Dutch people, or people in general, can show. Anything less than a completely voluntary union will result in massive resistance. 

&gt; This is also why America has such mix in Irish and Italians back in the day  

Weren't the Irish and Italians were discriminated because of long standing English protestant and Puritan bias towards all Catholics and especially the Irish ones? I mean some of the people who left for the colonies were hardcore religious fanatics, the type that praise only the Lord and the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell(who was also a known Irish killer). 

&gt; What does the average English, German, French and Italians believe in culturally currently? 

Culture isn't something you believe in, it's something you practice with other people. I suppose you are asking about what they view themselves as?

There is not a single document or any evidence existing where Finns would've deliberately tried to murder or commit genocide towards the Russian prisoners. Why? Because there were no motivation or desire for it.

Most of the prisoners who died did so in winter/spring 1942, when food in general was running out in the country. The Finns even asked for Red Cross aid. During summer 1942 the food situation improved, and hardly any prisoners died after that.

3396,"Hello! In this episode we will find out how Bessarabia lost it's autonomy  after the union with Romania.


&gt; Ep 5: Union of Bessarabia without conditions


After the proclamation of Union on 27 March 1918. Some changes were made in the leadership of the Country Council and the General Dircetors Council which strenghtened the Romaniophile orientation.


Ion Inculeț and Daniel Ciugureanu were inculded as ministers in the Romanian government. And in their place Constantin Stere and Petru Cazacu were elected instead. Both of which were unionists returned from exile to Romania.


Steadily, besides the leading functions,  delegates from the Romanian government appeared which trough their meddeling they were cancelling Bessarabia's autonomy.

&gt; Duliu Zamfirescu: Duliu Zamfirescu, writer and diplomat.


And the country council, from now on called trough royal decree


&gt; King Ferdinand: From now on I decide when you meet


Worked from a distance from spring to autumn, from less than 2 months.

As honey moons were slowly getting consumed and was letting to be seen that Romania considered Bessarabia a province under it's control. The autonomist camp tried in vain to save the conditions of the union.

&gt; Ion Inculeț: Romania should follow us. Not the other way around

&gt; Autonomists: We want autonomy to be respected!


In the comitee of the Country Council which was in charge of the land reform, representatives of the Romanian government (Gheorghe Ionescu-Șișești, Gheorghe Munteanu-Murgoci and Constantin Filipescu) were also included.

&gt; Vladimir Țîganko: Nationalization of land!


&gt; Gheorghe Ionescu-Șișești: Romanian culture and agriculture


Using the argument of harmonising the Bessarabian laws with the Romanian ones they managed to form a majority which will replace the radical president of the comitee with a more moderate one.

&gt; Comitee members: Țîganko should leave! Erhan should come!


And to reject the propositons which were considered ""Bolshevik"".


Such as the confiscation of land without compensation and the surface of  50 ha of lots reserved for the great land owner.

&gt; Council member: the land lords will get screwed!



The last one was lifted up to 100 ha and the confiscation of land in order to give it to peasants will happen  in exchange of the compensation of land lords.


With Romania rejoining the war and with the return of Romanian authorities from Iași to Bucharest, the new liberal government asked the Country Council the review of the 27 march declaration.


&gt; Constantin Coandă: Alright boys! The fun is over!

&gt; Constantin Stere: A review you shall get.



The ultimatum put face to face the unions without conditions and the autonomists.


&gt; Unionists: Union without condition!

&gt; Autonomists: Union but with autonomy!


The unionists came with suplimentary arguments:

1. The land problem was almost solved


2. The Conservative government in Romania was replaced by a Liberal one

3. And the universal suffrege was declared


But the Bessarabian electoral law project also included the women's voting rights.

While the new Romanian electoral law was still only granting the right to vote to men.


The autonomist camp from the Country Council protested imediatly trough a memorium initiated by 10 Moldovans and signed by 30 other offcialites from Bessarabia.


&gt; Unionists: Union without conditions!

&gt; Autonomists: I reject this abuse! We want autonomy in Greater Romania!


The deocument condamned the abuses of the Romanian authorities and asked the government for:


* 1  .  The suspenssion of the state of emergency and the reestablishment of the civil rights and liberties


* 2  . Ensurance of the rights of ethnic minorities


* 3  . Dissolution of the military comissariat of Bessarabia

* 4   . Withdrawl of the Gendarmes to the barracks

* 5  .   Maintainance of the local auto administration organisms



* 6  .   Return of the dismissed clerks and magistrates



* 7  .    Adoption of the regional electoral law


* 8  . reelection of the Country Council and the General Directors Council leadership

* 9 . And the creation of a comission to investigate the abuses from last months.


In fact the claims list was nothing else but a reafirmation of the union conditions. But those who signed it were a minority this time.


On 27 November 1918 the members of the Moldovan bloc and a part of the deputees of the peasants faction voted in a majority the union of Bessarabia and Romania without conditions along with Bukovina, Transylvania, Crișana and Banat


&gt; Unionists: Union without conditions, 27 November was 10 December after the new calendar.

Right. Maybe they are getting tired of it because Hollywood and the media glorify the pacifist viewpoint and condemn the traditional viewpoint; that there is nothing wrong with choosing to be a warrior, that citizens have an obligation to the defense of their own society and that condemning military action, even when justified, just for the sake of being edgy or trying to portray yourself as somehow “enlightened” is cowardly and pathetic.

&gt; Not to mention being pressured to constantly thank people with your warped world view for “their service”.

Bouchez takes over from former prime minister and current president of the European Council [Charles Michel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Michel). Bouchez is often situated at the right wing of his party.
* The social liberal Francophones' interest party [DéFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9FI) also has a new chairman. François De Smet will take over from [Olivier Maingain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Maingain), who has lead the party since 1995.
* A negotiation note by coalition informer [Paul Magnette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Magnette) (PS) was leaked to the press. The note, which would have to serve as the basis for a government agreement, mainly consisted of rather leftwing policies. The note was leaked after some [Open Vld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Vlaamse_Liberalen_en_Democraten) politicians suggested that a social democrat - liberal - green coalition was in the making. That's why some people speculate that the conservative [N-VA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Flemish_Alliance), which opposes such a coalition, leaked the note to harm the Flemish liberals.

3504,"Hello! In this episode we will find out how Bessarabians saw the union with Romania and what made it more complicated than initially believed

&gt; Ep 3: Union with Bessarabia from Chișinău's perspective


24 January 1918. What a grandiuous day!


The Council of the Country proclaimed the inependence of Moldovan Democrat Republic and in all of Bessarabia there was so much peace that you wanted the  intervention of the protective Romanian army.


But as newbie as the Bessarabians were in state policies, the more ferocious was the world around them.


The Ukrainians earned the protection of the Central Powers and regained the curage to ask for parts of Bessarabia


&gt; Hrushevsky : The Germans give us peace for grains



The Bolsheviks in Odessa were dying to cross the Dnister again.


Germans and Austro-Hungarians were making themselves at home in their eastern campaign.


And the stationing of the Romanian troops on an undetermine period of time and the few abuses they made


&gt; Ernest Broșteanu: We are saying as long as we have to.


&gt; Pantelimon Erhan: Some Soialist depties were assassinated

&gt; Just a coincidence


Begun to rise suspicions in the minds of the Bessarabians


More than that, the delegations of the Moldovan Democratic Republic didn't reach Brest-Litovsk where thomorw's Russia and Ukraine were made . 

Nor Buftea/Bucharest where the borders of tomorrow's Romania were being established.

&gt; Ion Inculeț: The wind from the East is blowing us


With it's independence unrecognised at the peace conferences and with vulnerabilty in the face inevitable expansionist lust of the neighbors, the Country Council was in a great dillema.


How to keep both the integrity and independence of Bessarabia at the same time?


For most Moldovans it became obvious that the best scenario possible was the strong collaboration with Romania.


The Romanian army saved a lot of people from exile or even death and defeated the worst enemies of the country council.


More than that, the independence of Bessarabia was greeted by the Romanian government and at least in declaration it was supporting it's international recognition.


But not all of them believed in the eventually good intentions of Romania and other members of the Country Council  wanted something else entirely.


In total 6 opinion currents were formed about the fate of Bessarabia.


&gt; 6 beautiful wishes


* 1 .  Union with Romania under every conditions on the basis of national comunity and the historical precedent.


* 2 . Union with Romania only  with equality inside a federation


* 3 . Union with Romania but without the Country Council getting implicated. Wanted by the great owners in Bessarabia who's representatives went directly to King Ferdinand.


&gt; They burned my chateau, sir


* 4 . The independence of the Moldovan Democratic Republic

* 5 . Union with Ukraine. Wanted obviously by a few Ukrainian deputies and

* 6 . The return to a Russian federation wanted by a few minorities


In the time of the 2 months which followed after the declaration of Independence, the showdown between the main currents, The Roamanianphile-Unionist one and the Pro-Independence one unvailed 2 neuralgic points which divided the country council

&gt; The problem is complex and has many aspects


The country project of the Moldovan Democrat Republic was so ahead of the political and social horisons in Romania that many have asked themselves if Romania will respect the revolutionary conquests of Bessarabia.


&gt; Romania will drag us back


The ones in the peasant and minorities factions didn't really like the perspective of replacing the Tsarist domination with another domination, this time from Bucharest


&gt; In Romania the landlords are in power

&gt; From a yoke to another


The 2nd problem was that the country council didn't have the power to take decisions when it comes to union.



&gt; With what right do we decide?!


The declaration of independence accepted by everyone was underlining that only a Popular Gathering chosen trough a fully democratic vote was entitled to decide the destiny of Bessarabia.


&gt; Our declaration say otherwise



The promise of the convocation of this constitutional gathering was quickly drowned by the fears that Ukraine was preparing to annex Bessarabia in agreement with the Central Powers.


&gt; Ukraine wants us to her!



In consequence, the Country Council which was still a somwhat democratic organism accorded the responsability of deciding the future of Bessarabia.


&gt; Let's do it fast like the wind

&gt; No time for people's soverignity

&gt; Let us decide the fate of Bessarabia


Most deputies agreed with this emergency measure.

&gt; We propose, we vote, us in everythign


Leaving this objections aside. At the end of February a majority for union with Romania was already formed in the Country Council


&gt; Alexandru Averescu: I am Averescu, the new Prime Minister of Romania


&gt; Ion Inculeț: The country council is for Union with Romania


And the council of Bălți, Soroca and Orhei counties have emited calls for union at the same time with the agitation in the Moldovan press.

&gt; We are the most Moldavian counties


During March unionists only had to decide if to impose conditions and which ones shoudl those be.

The debate ignited in the Moldovan bloc between those who wanted greater autonomy from the position of defender of the democratic and liberal revolution (Ion Inculeț and Pantelimon Erhan)


&gt; Pantelimon Erhan: Bessarabia revolutionary land


And the nationalists (Ion Pelivan, Daniel Ciugureanu, Ion Buzdugan and Pantelimon Halippa) which were trusting that the wishes of the Bessarabians will be satisfied  within the centralized Romanian system.

&gt; Ion Pelivan: Bessarabia Romanian land



The negotiations with the Romanian government were also added then lead by the Conservative Alexandru Marghiloman.


&gt; Alexandru Marghiloman: The Mother country loves you with conditions


And in the end it resulted in the project of a resolution to thank all 3 parties being voted by the country council on 27 March.


The Solemn meeting on 27 march 1918 was just a formality.

In the presence of a delegation lead by Alexandru Marghiloman himself the Country Council adopted the resolution of a union which was supported by 86 out of 138 deputies with right to vote.


&gt; Ion Inculeț: From this day forward and forever [Bessarabia] is uniting with it's mother Romania


69% out of the ones present voted in favor of the union. Which show that a 3th of the representatives saw the statute of the country and the rules of the political game differently.

&gt; We don't have a mandate for such a great decision

&gt; Federation or else independence


But the euphoria of the Moldovans was big, the day of celebration arrived and the solving of technic details could wait some more.

After the declaration of the country council was read, Alexandru Marghiloman accepted in the name of the King and Romanian state the conditions asked

&gt; Alexandru Marghiloman: With both deep emotions and towering pride I decide

This vet absolutely has a right to his opinion. 

But I do find it interesting how his message is so well received as if his perspective is absolute, while other combat veterans with different outlooks are discredited and shunned.

For example, former US Marine general James Mattis was highly criticized in the public media for things he said about war. This man was one of the most well-respected warriors in US military history with loads of combat experience.

But because it didn’t fit the narrative of being a pacifist cunt, he was condemned for it.

* A minimum pension of €1500 at 67 or after 42 years of working
* The possibility of receiving unemployment benefits in case of voluntary resignation to change jobs
* Tax cuts for companies hiring their second and third employee (now that's only the case for the first employee)
* A reduction of carbon emmission of 55% by 2030, no more fossil fuel based company cars by 2030 (currently a lot of companies give a car as part of the salary because it's taxed less than the same value as wage)
* A 3 billion euro investment in rail services
* More investments into justice and the prison system, higher focus on cyber crime
* GPs, dentists and psychiatrists fully free at use, ending supplements at hospitals
* All benefits raised to the poverty line (to be fair, that's a promise that every government makes)
* A more humane treatment of both legal and illegal immigrants, faster repatriation, stricter family reunion law
* State reform after 2024; one federal electoral district and replacing the senate by a citizen assembly by lot

The note does not include any privatisations of cuts in social security. It also doesn't contain any fiscal reforms, so we don't know how this supposed government program would be funded.

3667,"Maison Guiette also known as Les Peupliers, is a house in Antwerp, Belgium, designed by Le Corbusier in 1926 and built in 1927. It was the studio and living quarters of René Guiette, a painter and art critic. One of the Franco-Swiss architect's lesser-known works, it is an early example of the International Style, being modelled on the 1925 Pavilion de l'Esprit Nouveau.

In this interior, it is the abstract palette of colors, related to the perception of space, the spirit of places and light, that essentially characterizes the house. The colors of the painted walls contribute either to reinforce their presence, or to make them somehow disappear in order to break the partitioning. Le Corbusier himself designed the color scheme during his only visit to the house, and followed the painting work closely. The rather limited choice boils down to the use of ultramarine, pale blue and periwinkle blue, shade and burnt, pink, ocher, English green and gray in tones ranging from Pearl gray to dark gray and white.

3699,"&gt;but they are

No, they're not, really. That's a very loaded and partial take on what moderation is all about.

I know first hand that moderation is a delicate and complicated job, I've done it extensively over a decade ago, and I wasn't even remotely looking for a power trip, nor to push my opinions. I was particularly careful with my interferences, tried to be as invisible as possible, and seldom removed sensitive content, to let discussions run their course as freely as possible. 

The bulk of a genuine moderation, from my perspective, is all about soft damage control. It obviously doesn't involve censoring an opinion, no matter how harsh or unpopular it is. The only things that should be removed are obvious rules breaks. Not *debatable*, borderline rules breaks. The *plain obvious* ones, to guarantee that the place remains *somewhat* civil enough for discussion to take place without devolving into a cesspit.

&amp;nbsp;

It's worth noting that I personally never had to deal with a faulty moderation on this sub. So I don't know if this is a manufactured issue, an occasional mess up being blown up out of proportion, or an actual problem.

Either way, while moderators aren't perfect, just like everybody else, please don't gratuitously slander people spending their free time to help managing a community.

Besides, the Japanese Zen Buddhism is really not that different from Islam when it comes to militant fanaticism and martyrdom.

3775,"&gt; You kept saying this and still can't provide a source for any of it.

The source is the UN charter dude, and the Peace of Westphalia.

&gt; So what you're saying is that Serbia got around the legal restrictions on wars of aggression by hiring mercenaries to do the fighting in Bosnia and therefore retaliating against Serbia itself is a crime?

Now you are getting it. And thats precisely the reason the US or NATO, did not bomb Serbia any time between 1991-1995, and only bombed those mercs in Bosnia in 1995, a little bit, only their HQ and command-and-control systems. And no one is objecting or claiming that bombing was illegal - bombing was conducted with the consent of the internationally recognized Bosnian state.

&gt; by hiring mercenaries to do the fighting

Its not illegal to hire mercenaries, its not illegal to send 'volunteers', because freedom of movement is a human right. See also ISIS fighers from Germany UK, Sweden, do you want to hold these states responsible for crimes of their citizens? There was many many french german 'volunteers' fighting for the Croatian side, and many citizens of USA, Argentina etc, coming to fight on Croatian side. If you claim to ""punish"" Serbian state for thier citizens joining a war, then expect China to start ""punishing"" France and Sweden using the same prinicple eh? 

The NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999, is totally illegal bullshit though, blatant violation of UN charter.

It was great to move there in the 80's and 90's, but its changed dramatically. The costs associated with living are completely unequal to the rewards for labour, and the jobs that provided significant middle class income are disappearing. Tech jobs are not competitive salary wise and don't have a national supply chain where individuals of many different educational backgrounds can succeed.

Canada is a country where nobody trusts any of peers. Money hoarding and tax avoidance occur because to put money into the system is to help people you don't trust. Communities are fragmented and familial support is replaced with expensive administrative support.

It took moving to Europe to help me realize that North America will be a failed state, and people will propagandize themselves into believing otherwise by consuming products and services that implicitly mask reality.

4083,"    That's a death camp. A real, no excuse, DEATH CAMP.

No, it isn't. Birkenau was a death camp and I think it's disrespectful to even comparing the two. What the Germans did to the Jews is literally the worst thing that ever happened in human history. Those camps were death factories running with ruthless efficiency and 6 milion people were slaughtered. I know little about allied POW camps but I am 100% certain that they were nowhere near as bad as Auschwirz or Dachau or one ot the other dozen camps all over Europe. 

As to the German POW in Soviet Union, I'm not surprised at all. Soviet Union was just as evil as Third Reich and they sent millions of their own people to the GULAG so the fact that they did the same to German soldiers is no surprise. Also, comparing USSR to Great Britain or USA is also really misjudged because, even thouth neither GB nor USA were perfect and they had many flaws, USSR was a truly evil regime run by a psychopath.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/e3vxdw/german_wwi_veteran_describes_killing_a_french/f97ib5l/,elukawa,1575165971

4096,"I shouldn't have used the word paranoid. It's not that it scares me or tricks me into seeing them everywhere or prevents me from going to the mall, it just reminds me of its existence and not just for myself but people around me. Ever since I lost one of my best friends to a unnecessary and preventable workplace accident I've been kind of protective and alert. If a friend of mine is late to a meetup I won't be throwing thousands of calls or texts their way but I definitely worry a lot and after that one call I'll leave it be, but not internally. I don't want my protectiveness to be a burden, it shouldn't be. But I believe firmly in worrying when most don't, to be ""the tenth man"".

Life is fragile, what we build is fragile. We can't prevent everything from happening but where I can help it I'd like to do my part so ensure the safety of my friends and I already helped in a significant way. 

Last year I heard a friend was having regular short circuits that went away by themselves after switching the relevant group on again and I immediately started asking questions. Ultimately I found that an outlet was overheating because the damaged and bent power plug of his washing machine. He didn't have a circuit breaker and if he had let this go ignored for a day or two longer he might very well have burned to death in his sleep or lost his possessions, it was an old working class home that is essentially insulated by straw and lots of it. 

Every time we had a fire in similarly constructed buildings in the city the half a block burned with it like [here](https://www.lc.nl/dossier/brand-kelders). That fire took an hour to spread to five buildings and after almost three hours of fighting the fire with hoses connected to high pressure foam cannons, the low pressure hoses from the truck's water storage didn't help at all and after almost gaining control it lit up again. Took 12 hours to fully extinguish a fire that was essentially a gas heater where the gas tank was positioned too close to the heater, resulting in explosion, 30 minutes after that the whole building was on fire and spread to another. 

I'm just telling you this to show that I'm not exaggerating by saying my friend could have died. If I just said ""that's old homes for ya"" like the twenty other people listening to that damn story I might have had final proof that I wasn't wrong to worry and be alert. I hope I'll never prove this, I dearly hope I people will keep telling me I worry too much because in a sense I do but in another sense I don't. It's very conflicting but my past experiences showed me to worry. I won't burden others with it, but it's who I am.

4098,"He committed a terrible, terrible crime, yes. He needed judgement and punishment, yes. And all residents of the UK have a right to live their lives without being victims of crime and so prisoners who are likely to reoffend (ie harm citizens) should be retained in prison.

The only evidenced-based method of achieving this is to rehabilitate criminals in prison and that requires a change in mindset from prison-is-punishment and lock-the-bastards-up-and-let-them-rot. Those methods, ironically, _create_ crime through recidivisim. And murderers (mostly) tend not to reoffend.

Day release is part of rehabilitation and the process of becoming a normal citizen again. He's been judged to be safe to release on the streets, and I'd say he's proved something by his actions there and paid something back to society.

4228,"Firstly, that's what a nation is - *A nation is a stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, history, ethnicity, or psychological make-up manifested in a common culture.* A nation is not synonymous with a country. 

Secondly, if you want to have a legal debate on whether russification is genocide as per the UN definition, then you should also read the UN commentary to the sections you've listed: 

&gt;The specific ethnic and/or national groups of the population which are of interest in each country are dependent upon individual national circumstances. Some of the criteria by which ethnic groups are identified are ethnic nationality (i.e., country or area of origin, as distinct from citizenship or country of legal nationality), race, colour, **language**, **religion, customs of dress or eating, tribe or various combinations of these characteristics**.

So language alone is already constituent to how the UN understands ethnicity/nationality. Russification is a form of genocide even on the most base level, because the funtion is the same - to replace and/or turn the indigenous population into people that are virtually indistinguishable from the average russian via education and social policy. In other words, to turn them into people that do not identify with their former nationality/ethnicity.

4241,"&gt;If you are talking about SNA then 21 out of 28 former FSA groups were actually a product of Western support, sure they stopped supporting them, not because they realized that they were jihadists, they always knew that.

Okay? So because westerners did it that makes it ok for the glorious Turkish state to do it? 

&gt;    The repayment of a bad action is one equivalent to it. But if someone pardons
    and puts things right, his reward is with Allah…”
    **Qur’an, 42:40**

&gt; It's because they've found a more ""presentable"" and obedient proxy like YPG. Which had direct connections to PKK. There was no choice for Turkey, it couldn't just support it's own enemy, it couldn't support Assad, as that would be seen as even worse by the West, so Turkey just kept supporting jihadists against YPG.

Didn't Turkey just accept joint Turk Russian patrols of the border, why didn't Turks come to a similar agreement with the US. Oh that's right, because you wanted to ethnically cleanse the area.

&gt;And even though everyone seemed surprised by the recent operation, Turkey was almost begging US to withdraw YPG, so US-Turkey alone could create YPG-FSA free safe zone, both to ensure Turkey's border security and to build new towns so that refugees (which there are currently +4million in Turkey, and it's basically shielding Europe from a crisis right now) could return.

Turkey isn't the victim, Erdogan was losing popularity and used the anti immigrant feeling in Turkey as a lightning rod to beat the Kurds with by promising to kick out Arabs at the expense of the Kurds living in northern Syria. 

This is the same Erdogan who said the MHP were terrorists and was convieniently helped out by a suicide bombing in 2015 when he lost his majority. 

&gt; But US never took Turkey seriously even though Turkey warned that it would operate by itself as the last resort. And Trump made a weird move by not withdrawing YPG, but just outright leaving them to Turkey. 

Wrong. Erdogan repeatedly complained to Trump about the YPG and Trump then withdrew as he didn't want Turkey, a NATO member, more alienated at the expense of the YPG. 

&gt;After that YPG still didn't show any signs of retreat and there we are today, it was completely expected. And Europe does not have a right to complain as they have been supporting an terrorist organisation that was directly damaging Turkey. You just simply don't get to complain about ""Turkey supporting terrorists"".

The YPG is indigenous to northern Syria, what the hell are you talking about 'signs of retreat' what was completely expected was a Turkish excuse to invade northern Syria as they're afraid of their southern flank being exposed to a viable Kurdish dominated government. 

Turkey supports jihadists and another other bunch of terrorists in its aims to defeat Kurdish ethnic identity which isn't controlled by Turkey, it will lose.

The point I want to make is that many people are complaining about how much data these companies are collecting but on at the same time they either are too lazy to search for alternatives or don't want to use these alternatives because of their worse quality which -in many cases- is because of the ironic fact that these alternatives have less (personal) data to work with, especially for targeted ads and the service itself.

4304,"Maltese businessman Yorgen Fenech has been charged with complicity in the murder of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in 2017.

The investigation into Caruana Galizia's death has rocked the island's government. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat is under pressure to resign.

His chief aide, Keith Schembri, quit this week amid reports he was being questioned by police, while Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi also resigned and Economy Minister Chris Cardona took the decision to suspend himself.

Such has been the sensitivity of this case that Malta's main courthouse was opened specially, late in the evening for this hearing. Yorgen Fenech, one of Malta's richest men, was brought in under police guard.

Outside court Ms Caruana Galizia's family said it was now time for Mr Muscat to resign as the allegations of shady dealing stretch to those around him. So far though Mr Muscat has refused to go.


Mr Schembri, who had previously been named in the Panama Papers, quit.

Caruana Galizia alleged that Mr Schembri and Mr Mizzi had benefited from secretive ""shell companies"". Both deny wrongdoing.

Three men - brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and their friend Vincent Muscat, all in their 50s - have been charged with triggering the bomb which killed Caruana Galizia near her home in October 2017. They were arrested in December 2017 and pleaded not guilty in pre-trial proceedings.

Vincent Muscat later told police the bomb had been placed in Caruana Galizia's car while it was parked outside the walled compound where she lived. The killings earned the trio **150,000 euros (£132,000)**, Reuters news agency reports.

The trouble was that the Finns resisted, alot and the Soviets numerical and technical superiority struggled to tell on the narrow roads, the Finns cut off and could move around on skis and worse since they weren't supposed to stay there and fight the Soviet troops didn't have the supplies to survive.

After the city was re-captured by the Austrian troops under Eugene de Savoy from the Ottomans, they literally destroyed the ruins that were left and rebuilt it from 0. Most of the historic city of Timisoara today is built under Austrian rule, so Hungarians can't take much credit on this one. As for the population census...Timisoara was a German city mostly in 1918, both Hungarians and Romanians were minorities. Considering the whole region of Banat as a whole, Romanians were the most populous, followed by Serbs, Germans and Hungarians that were the smallest ethnic group. My family lived here for at least 4 generations, so don't start me on this topic. 

As for the architecture...I agree, commie additions are ugly, but I cannot of any Eastern European city with nice commie architecture. The additions that were made in the Interwar period under Romanian administration are quite nice in my opinion, lots of villas and nice mansions.

&gt; Eternal paradise. War (or other means to achieve above) is just a tool. The goal is living in peace.

No, that is wrong. Peace is just preparation for war in Nazi point of view. Conflict is constant. And if all external enemies are defeated, then there are new internal enemies.

Also, you think a world in which a few people enslave &amp; kill all others is ""eternal paradise""? More like eternal hell.

&gt; Classic liberalism is no less ""survival of the fittest"".

No, not from idealistic classic liberalist point of view. The end goal of liberalism is a world society of free citizens where borders don't matter anymore and trade secures peace. Unlike socialism, classical liberals don't want total equality, but that does not mean it is pure ""survival of the fittest"" either.

&gt; Funny how you bring up socialism though. How about ""permanent revolution"" etc? :) And every time socialism is attempted to implement it becomes literally survival of the fittest...

That is because in every case where ""socialism"" was implemented, it was modeled after Stalins state socialism where it is an extremely authoritatian system that puts control in the hands of the state.

1. Government -&gt; Big Buildings, Politicians, Politics, Laws, Civil Servants, Social Security. An example will be how France could be both a Monarchy or a Republic, but it still remains France. Government and Political Systems change, but France is France. 

2. State - now the state is a bit more abstract, but it is both a geopolitical and a historical term. Think how a country's border can shrink or expand and it can exist both in the year 1646, 1846, 1946 and 2046. 

3. Nation, comes from the Italian ""nati"" which is the masculine version of ""nato"", which means ""to give birth"" or ""to birth"". Nation means those who were born, so the nation is connected by blood. 

So for example...

""Nation State"" refers to the State belonging to the Nation (rather than a single ruler). For example think of the 18-19th century and how there was a German Nation, but instead of the State and Nation being one, there were several German states ruled by different kings, thus there was a German Nation, but not a German State. 


Ethno-Nationalism on the other hand means not only those of the Nation, but of a specific ethnicity within a nation (not everyone born in the nation is of the same ethnicity).

There are several joint projects between NASA and ESA, including the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope (still to be launched, can be deemed as the successor or Hubble though it's not the same), the ISS, and the Orion spacecraft (which is basically an Orion capsule with an ATV (European) service module).  I agree with the other comments that there's no competition.

Another one also said France has its own program. Indeed. if you sum the (former) ESA budget to the budget of UKSA, CNES, ASI and DLR, the total number gets close to NASA's budget.

ESA can only get involved in peaceful projects because of its foundation treaty. No member state will give up its own space agency in favor of ESA because they have several military projects (e.g. spy satellites).

The thing is that the reconquista is a construct, an oversimplification and a borderline lie. But that's a loooong conversation. 

In short:

Muslim and jews were indeed ""purged"" in the sense that their reoigion became forbidden around the year 1500, but the overwhelming majority remained and kept practicing their relgion in secret.

That when the infamous spanish inquisition kicked in and began hunting down people accused of being false converts, but even then most remained.

Then around the mid 1600's it was decided that all those catholics known to be of muslim stock (they formed their own ethnic group called ""moriscos"")  were to be expelled, but even then most manahed to stay or actually came back. Those that didn't lived on in North Africa and some even became involved in the development of Timbuktú.

social lottery.

4584,"The first bombings were lead by Major N.A. Tokarev.

The main targets of the attack was the docks of Hankoniemi and the pride of the Finnish fleet, the armoured ships Väinämöinen and Ilmarinen (named after fictional characters in the national epic story Kalevala) but the ships had already moved to another location when the bombers and torpedo planes arrived (the submarine Iku-Turso, named after a monster from Kalevala was at the docks but the Soviet pilots did not notice it.) and as a result the planes went for their secondary obective, the city of Helsinki and more importantly the harbor of Hietalahti.

Because of the heavy cloud cover, although the planes had been fired upon earlier before they got to Helsinki, the alarm wasn't made until someone saw the bombs already descending towards the ground. If the planes were targeting the harbor then they missed by a lot because none of the harbor facilities were damaged, nor were the three icebreakers or the submarines Vesihiisi (named after a water monster from myths), Saukko (Otter) and Vesikko (European Mink) that were there. Instead the bombs struck the residential area near the shore, killing 91 people and injuring 236. The embassy of the Soviet Union was one of the damaged buildings (I'm sure there was an interesting phonecall made after the attack.)

4620,"&gt; This is the most warped, weirdest take on the situation.

It really isn't if you paid attention to Russia's propaganda network and to their strategic goals. A simple way to put it is that Russia has a lot of military/intelligence power, but lacks power in other ways, and so is trying to convert them to other forms of power. They're trying to convert their military power to political by weakening NATO/EU, and then scooping up the separatists. It was fairly obvious to me that Russia was influencing elections in the West since 2016, and I'm still confused why anyone denies it. Russia is doing this stuff fairly overtly. 

&gt;  Let's think about this: terrorism is as dangerous to Russia as to anyone else. Arguably, even more so to the Russians, than it is to Europe, because they already have islamic regions within the country that are quite hard in fact for them to properly control e.g. Dagestan and Chechnya. 

Ok do you think that all Muslims are the same or something? Now I'm not sure where you're getting this, since they control those areas with an iron fist. Russia's main security interests is in limiting NATO/EU expansion into its Western Borders, which is why they're attacking Ukraine.

&gt; So yes, obviously it's true that Russia didn't go to Syria in order to help Europe, but in order to mainly help themselves. Letting terrorism fester, is NOT an interest to Russia.

Except the terrorism has mainly affected Europe. It is in Russia's interest to let terrorism fester in Europe. Why? 

Terrorist attack -&gt; far right wingers gain support -&gt; the EU becomes less popular -&gt; countries leave the EU -&gt; Russia's influence grows. 

It's fairly simple. Russia's goal to stimulate far right wing parties in Europe, who will then break off Western alliances and be more friendly towards Russia, lifting the sanctions against them for attacking Ukraine. It's no coincidence that far right wing parties are friendly towards Russia. 

&gt; However, all this doesn't change the fact Russia was still the major player, and took lions share in eliminating ISIS, 

No it doesn't. Iran had a much larger role in defeating ISIS, like several magnitudes greater. Iran was the one landing massive amounts of troops to help Assad, as well as funding Shia militias in Iraq who were instrumental in crushing ISIS in Iraq. The lions share in eliminating ISIS goes to the Kurds and the Shia militas. 

&gt; the EU's response to the whole thing was pitiful at best.

They did the same thing Russia did without disproportionately bombing civilians. 

&gt; Without Russia's help, ISIS most likely would have been able to take over Syria, and perhaps even Iraq.

No they wouldn't have. ISIS did not have that capability to start with. They did not have that many men and controlling such a large territory would've been unteneable. The territory they did control was mostly desolate outside of the cities on their periphery. It really should say, without Iran's help. 

&gt; The fact that we do not know how to handle the so called 'refugees' is not Russia's fault, it's 100% down to the incompetence of our own leadership. 

That's dumb. The EU's leaders were handed millions of refugee's and then a xenophobic reaction, which was transparently partly fueled by Russia's propaganda network, it's a miracle they've handled them this well at all. They were very competent, but the huge strain of the problem is overwhelming. 

&gt;  The EU's lack of credibility was already a well known issue before the Syria crisis, this was just pretty much the final nail in the coffin.

Uh no. The EU has an incredibly amount of credibility, still better than Russia, as the EU has, all around, been an incredible economic success lifting Eastern Europe out of poverty and creating large amounts of economic success for all of Europe and the ending of centuries long tensions, such as between Germany and France. The fact that countries which used to go to war almost regularly now have open borders and a shared currency is an impressive achievement. 

&gt; Letting terrorists go to Syria is not necessarily a bad strategy, if you have some way of tracking them and destroying them right there in Syria.

That's a terrible strategy for killing terrorists, just kill them right away. It's not like Russia has a credible judiciary. It is however a great strategy for empowering ISIS in order to stimulate terrorist attacks in the EU to weaken it. 

&gt; I would also suggest that you look into the atrocities the ISIS committed in Syria, because a lot of people seem to be unaware of how evil that organization is/was. Just a small taster:

Not sure what you're getting at here. If you're trying to respond to my comment about the SAA being murderous, then yeah, it's not a competition. Russia and the SAA cause a disproportionate amount of civilian casualties. Russia's goal is to create more refugee's to put more strain on the EU/NATO, which it has succeeded at.

&gt; The naginata (なぎなた, 薙刀) is a pole weapon and one of several varieties of traditionally made Japanese blades (nihonto)[1][2]. Naginata were originally used by the samurai class of feudal Japan, as well as by ashigaru (foot soldiers) and sōhei (warrior monks).[3] The naginata is the iconic weapon of the onna-bugeisha-archetype, a type of female warrior belonging to the Japanese nobility.

&gt; Due to the influence of Westernization, after the Meiji Restoration the perceived value of martial arts, the naginata included, dropped severely. It was from this time that the focus of training became the strengthening of the will and the forging of the mind and body. **During the Showa period, naginata training became a part of the public school system in 1912, and it ""remains a staple of girls’ physical education""[15]**",,/r/europe/comments/e3v4f9/polish_chef_łukasz_chases_london_terrorist_with/f95lepw/,CourierNew3,1575130330

4662,"I always find it kind of funny when the media tries to use the ""Millions of years!"" or even ""Billions of years!"" thing as a way to make it sound extra scary and wild. It's not as simple as ""longer time = worse"" at all, in a lot of ways it's actually the exact opposite from a danger/radiation perspective. The decay is what causes the radiation so the longer the half-life, the less serious the radiation is at any given time.

If you *have* to walk past some radioactive material, you certainly want to pick something with a long ass half-life (slow decay rate) since it'll give off radiation at a much slower rate so you'll be exposed to less radiation by walking past it.

The thing that's worse about slower decaying stuff is obviously that it can contaminate an area for a long ass time if something goes wrong (If it's not *so* slow decaying that it's simply not dangerous at all). In that way the fast decaying stuff is less bad I suppose. If something goes wrong with fast decaying material, at least it'll ""fix"" itself relatively fast by simply decaying.. Although it'll be way more likely to kill anyone who happens to be nearby until it's gone. 

For example, if you chose to walk past Bismuth absolutely nothing would happen to you since its half-life is so long that it took a long time to even find out it was radioactive at all since it gives off such tiny amounts of radiation. From wiki: 

&gt;Bismuth was long considered the element with the highest atomic mass that is stable, but in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay with a half-life more than a billion times the estimated age of the universe.[4][5] Because of its tremendously long half-life, bismuth may still be considered stable for almost all purposes.[5]

On the other hand you don't want to choose Iodine-131 for this experiment since it's half-life is eight days so it gives off radiation like crazy.. But at least it'll all have decayed in no time I guess. So the potential long-term issues are fewer but it'll likely kill anyone nearby when the accident happens.

It seems like the ""Millions of years!"", ""Billions of years!"" etc. just works well as clickbait since people apparently think that all radioactive materials give off radiation at the same rate and are equally dangerous and therefore assume that it's simply a case of ""Longer time = Worse"".


It seems pretty dumb to actually shut the plants down though. At least use up what you can from the stuff you already have, it'll be much easier to store away after it's used.

4708,"&gt;Do you really think that the children should have had long knifes on them and that that would have really helped them in any way? 

I'm not claiming that whatsoever (also a 6cm knife is hardly long). But I would definitely feel less comfortable walking around a city with my wife and children if I didn't have anything available to defend myself in an emergency.

&gt;We just have agreed as a society that doing some things does more harm than it is good and this is one of them, we dont let people walk around with atomic bombs or automatic rifles or long knives for that reason, 

And yet the people who don't care about the law do it anyways. So in the end you had the thugs and criminals who are armed and everyone else besides the police who are helpless. The criminals know this and can obviously use it to their advantage. 

&gt;These kind of things are never going to be completely avoidable

But what happens when knife related attacks become more and more prevalent? In London violent crimes are becoming more common, and now the only option they have is to keep adding more police. I personally don't want to live in a police state where butterknives are illegal, and facetracking/police are located on every corner in the name of 'safety'. What is the point of this safety if you are giving up freedoms left and right?

But while nuclear power is better than coal (it's not really an argument for nuclear power, anything is better than coal), that doesn't mean it should be seen as anything but bridge technology. 

Nuclear power is not cheap (compare the true levelized cost of energy by source, including mining, environmental damage, maintenance, etc), nuclear is actually pretty mediocre, onshore wind, water or geothermal are already a lot better even in the most developed countries. It's also not renewable. It's good at providing electricity in a steady and reliable way without polluting the environment too much (except for where the mining happens).

4757,"&gt; I was referring to the situation when they were at our doorsteps, from that moment on we basically only had two options.
&gt; 
&gt; 

A radical one or a radical one.

Nevertheless, Im more concerned about the fact that little to nothing has been done ever since. And that fallout of that situation has been ""well, just distribute them"". This gave the far right so much fuel for the fire ... and now. Well, look where we are.

&gt;So yeah, the reason we have so few deportations (although, we actually have deported many) is due to the system and our rule of law.

That's not what I was talking about.

I know the judical beurocracy takes it time. Also know it can, and was in many cases amended. Eg you don't get a two appeals, you get one. Most recently in Greece.

But vast majority of those who had their application rejected and appeals rejected, they stay. This is solvable issue, this is issue that hasn't been solved because it requires firm foreign policy.

We don't need those embassies to issue return documents. We have laissez-faire passports that we can issue to them and then put them on the next flights. And the African countries are just taking a piss out of it, not accepting it as it happened in Niger. Now you tell populus that they have hundreds of thousands of people who have no business being in the Europe and the reason why they stay is because some banana state with economy the size of Lichtenstein simply plays hardball. Its ridiculous, no wonder they are angry. EU soft approach obviously doesn't work. It needs hard approach. It needs threat of sanctions, withdrawal of aid until they dance as we whistle. Centrists could've done that years ago. They didn't.

&gt;This is exactly the sentiment i was talking about. Sure, in the moment the people feel like closing the borders would be the way to go - thats an natural, emotional reaction. However, logically speaking, doing so wouldnt solve any of the problems we have.

Would solve a lot if its part of the system. NGOs eg claim that now the borders are closed. We receive still 100k irregulars via them annualy. The Ozzie system is a system proven to work, in last 4 years it could've been tailored to European situation. But it wasn't because it was blocked and vetoed at every step by ... certain parties.

&gt;In terms of migrants, we could maybe focus more on inclusion and prevent forming of seperate societies in the poorer districts.

Its already proven sociological fact that segregated districts can turn only one way - however for years the WE has been trying to reverse that and dividing migrants and fugees into majority-districts. Problem with that? After few years they moved to Moroccan / Turkish / Arab etc. districts again because you can't deny them freedom of movement.

The Danish solution is to seek-and-destroy parallel systems when it comes to education for instance, but also pre-school.

Just to clarify, i absolutely dont thing its wrong to be proud of ones country or heritage - i mean, we are arguably living in the best place in the world. So might as well be proud of it. 

But nationalism, like the one propagated by the likes of salvini etc is what i am opposed to. Also it is very very dangerous for our EU collective. 

Now returning to your point, i dont think this id something that shouldnt be addressed. It is a valid concern and a valid question, why some immigrants dont regard themselves as part of the european lifestyle. 
This is something that should be addressed and dealt with in the future, or it could create some serious issues down the road.

However, again, the 'solutions' brought forward by le penn, salvini etc are definetely NOT the way to go, as they arent really solutions in the first place but rather simply right-wing populistic ideas.

There is no way to confirm if someone has really been rehabilitated anyway. He could easily pretend. For example he didn't deny to take part in the program. He pretended he was willing to participate just to earn his early release.

He was planning mass murder and he was stopped by the police, not because he regretted it. That should be a life sentence, no parole. Then the same justice system which put him away armed his hand.

Cs-137 never accumulates any Ba-137m. As soon as a Cs-137 atom decays via beta, the produced Ba-137m also immediately decays via gamma to stable Ba-137.

So even though the half-life of Ba-137m is extremely short, each Ba-137m decay can only happen after a Cs-137 decay, so the actual observed radioactivity is that of the Cs-137, you just get the extra gamma coming from the Ba-137m as well on each count.",,/r/europe/comments/e3rr5t/germany_is_closing_all_its_nuclear_power_plants/f94wwso/,zolikk,1575107883
4875,"&gt;I on the other hand cannot not understand why more people in Europe don't embrace nationalism

Because nationalism is pretty much the contrary to what the EU stands for. The EU is a gigantic and the most successful peace project, that emphasises that we are stronger together, that we can grow together and that we can prosper together. 

Of course, in todays day and age this is very true. The EU single market is the second largest market in the world. On the other hand, if it was every country for itself i doubt that european countries would be as wealthy as they are today. Sure some countries like germany, france and the uk would still do rather well - but nowhere near as good as right now. 
No to speak of smaller countries. 

Also our EU-unity provides lots of opportunities - free movement for example, which is especially valuable for younger people and students. 

&gt;gradual removal of local identity, language and ethnicity. 

Depends on what you define as local identity - identities have evolved over centuries, and they still evolve. So there is no such thing as a constant, fully developed identity. 

The local languages dont really disappear tho, do they? 

I dont know where you are going with the ethnicity part. 

&gt;It means more power in the hands of global companies who care not for anything but profits

What youre describing from here on out is more neo-liberalism than liberalism per se.

4977,"Born in communist Yugoslavia and I can tell you that this wasn't the case there until the 1980s. Yugoslavia is a bit different, but the 1970s and early 1980s were relatively good, and a lot of people have fond memories of that period. Unlike in the West, health care (US) and a college education were free, and people got housing for nothing or next to nothing. Most companies had vacation resorts where their employees could go to vacation at a greatly subsidized rate. Eastern bloc countries still have the highest percent of the population owning their own homes, although we can argue about how necessary or good this is. 

Yugoslavia wasn't a part of the Warsaw pact (it's the founding member of the unaligned movement, actually) and sort of did it's own thing.

There is a joke from these times that a Yugoslav and Romanian kid were playing near the border and the Yugoslav kid takes out a banana to eat. The amazed Romanian boy, never having seen a banana asks him what it is. ""You peasant, don't you even know what a banana is, are you so poor? I eat this every day"". A little bit insulted, the Romanian boy responds with ""well, you know what, at least we have the Russians and they could crush you if they wanted to"". ""Well"", replies the Yugoslav boy, we're a communist country too, if we wanted to, we could have the Russians protect us to"". To  that the Romanian boy replied, wistfully, ""Yes, but then you wouldn't have any bananas"". I've read this exact same joke in an Estonian museum in an exhibit on late communist times, only it's an easy and west Berliner in the exchange.

A lot of these shortages, btw, were planned. Measures were taken in the 1980s to restrict import of foreign goods to improve the trade balance and pay off debts. Caucescu probably went the farthest with this austerity policy but this had such a negative effect that his popularity dipped dramatically and it ultimately cost him his head. Mind you his austerity policy resulted in Romania paying off its entire public debt by 1989! Their debt went from 1.2bln to 13 bln from 1971 to 1982 and back to 0 in 1989. I'd half joke here that the international banking mafia popped him off for daring to dream of a debtless world. Debt makes the world go round and too strict austerity has a negative effect on the economy, but there were other factors in play here. 

TL;DR this is only in the last few years of the communist era, at least in Yugoslavia. The picture doesn't show free healthcare, free dental care (such it was), free university education and very accessible housing.",,/r/europe/comments/e3d9pa/back_in_the_communist_era_every_day_was_a_black/f94s97i/,eesti_techie,1575100833

If a society is actually honest, people can speak honestly within it, and can betray others without being endangered by doing so.  It is the protection of treachery that protects against evil.  When treachery is harmless, associations can stabilize only when there is sincerely no will towards betrayal.

We can judge cultures by the harmfulness of treachery within them.  My opinion of America was much, much higher before I learned that I lived within a society that punished treachery; my opinion of China and Russia is greatly reduced by the apparent difficulty of being treacherous within them.

The 1974 annexationist coup in Cyprus was brought to a halt when Turkey invaded a couple days later. It lasted a mere week, the Turkish enclaves were not involved in the events, and Greek cypriots were the main casualty of the coup. The pro-enosis military junta behind the coup in Greece was ousted later that same year, and democracy reinstated.

**45 years later**, Turkey still occupies the north of the island, when it's been crystal clear for decades that Turkish cypriots are not under any threat whatsoever, and even less so now that Cyprus is part of the EU and as such abiding to one of the most strict legislation in the world regarding both civil and human rights.

5068,"&gt;The SDF, as described above, is primarily composed of the YPG militia. That militia was itself officially founded in 2011 as the armed wing of the Syrian Kurdish party Democratic Union Party, or PYD. Turkey’s claim is that the PYD is an offshoot of the Turkish PKK and that the PKK had a hand in initially setting up the YPG. The PYD denies those links.

&gt;What’s indisputable is that the PKK had a presence in Syria until 1998, when the Syrian government banned the party. The PYD was formed in Syria five years later, with much of the same membership. Less clear is whether there are ongoing organizational and operational links between the PYD and PKK. Turkey says the cooperation between the two is clear, though it rarely cites concrete evidence. In 2016 testimony before the U.S. Congress, then-U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter also asserted there are “substantial ties” between the PYD and PKK. Independent reporting has described overlaps in membership.

&gt;However, in a 2017 article for Foreign Policy, Aldar Khalil, a high-ranking Syrian Kurdish politician, denied any such connections, writing that the PYD, like other Syrian Kurdish political groups, strictly adheres to a doctrine of noninterference in other countries. “It pains us to see those on the Turkish side of the border suffer from oppression and fear under Erdogan,” Khalil wrote. “But that is not our struggle, and we have said publicly and will say again that our territory and resources are not going to be used by the PKK or any other groups fighting Turkey.”

&gt; Also, the big negative of communism is that meritocracy is basically non existent. There is practically no difference between a doctor or a peasent when it comes to payment

I think this is actually what speaks to a lot of people, when they look up to the ideology, it sure is to me one of the aspects that speak to me. Because while the doctor may truly be talented, is his job more important than that performed by farmers or cleaners? For society to function you need both peasants and doctors and those its weird to me at least that the peasant must live with less wealth when society all in all couldn't function without him.

In general I find that most communists I speak with, like the communist ideal but realize that there are no realistic path towards that. And and therefore leans towards heavily socializing the state, but keeping the general democratic structure as seen in the country they live in. (Other than american communists who also lean towards reform of the political system)

Its a general patern in a lot of the really extreme ideologies in my experience, I know a ton of stated libertarians that realize their ideal state doesn't function and those lean towards building the closest possible thing, same thing with anarchists.

Russia's involvement is part of the reason things got so bad in Syria in the first place.

5242,"It's likely far too late.  If you read the IPCC report (2018), the 1.5 C target requires copious amounts of CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal) to be developed and deployed in the next 10 years or so.  The report uses nice euphemisms like ""untested"" and ""high risk"".  A more direct adjective is ""fictional"".  When I shared this section of the report with my friends and colleagues (scientists at the Department of energy, DoD, academia, and Max Planck, etc.) the responses largely fell into two categories: ""We're fucked"", or laughter followed by ""we're fucked"".   The 2.0 C target is technically achievable without CDR, under the following assumptions:

* Consumption is reduced by like \~75%.
* No more wars.
* The population hits a peak of 9 billion, then rapidly declines.
* People give up meat from their diets all around the world.  

And so on, stuff like that...  Even getting one of these feels like an impossibility.  After this report came out in 2018, what did we do in 2019 but set a new record for highest CO2 emissions ever.  Even if we had slowed them down, it's still not enough, but here we are shattering the new record every year.  Look at [this graph](https://blog.datawrapper.de/weekly-chart-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-crisis/), every climate measure taken hasn't even made a noticeable dent as CO2 emissions released per year continue to not only keep going, but skyrocket up even further.  And the present CO2 we've already sent up doesn't just fall back down anytime soon even if we could stop.  

You can hope the ship can be saved, but the water's already filled the lower decks.  I for one think it's safe to assume the ship is going down more likely than not.  We should try to save whatever we can, but the grimness of the situation cannot be overstated.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/e3jsgd/several_people_stabbed_on_busy_shopping_street_in/f94ihr5/,epicwinguy101,1575089388

5244,"There are two things at work. On the one hand, increased diversity is lowering levels of trust in communities (source). 

&gt; Ethnic diversity is increasing in most advanced countries, driven mostly by sharp increases in immigration. In the long run immigration and diversity are likely to have important cultural, economic, fiscal, and developmental benefits. In the short run, however, immigration and ethnic diversity tend to reduce social solidarity and social capital. New evidence from the US suggests that in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods residents of all races tend to ‘hunker down’. Trust (even of one's own race) is lower, altruism and community cooperation rarer, friends fewer. In the long run, however, successful immigrant societies have overcome such fragmentation by creating new, cross‐cutting forms of social solidarity and more encompassing identities. Illustrations of becoming comfortable with diversity are drawn from the US military, religious institutions, and earlier waves of American immigration.

On the other hand, terrorism compounds this distrust (source). The two are likely to intersect and feed off one another (although this is just an intuitive assumption). 

&gt; A central aim of terrorism is to drive people apart and destroy social trust. Still, there is little empirical research which has systematically investigated the relationship between terrorist attacks, fear of terrorism, and social trust. In addition, the impact of terrorism is usually assumed to be uniform across different individuals and societies. In order to investigate the impact of terrorism as well as the fear of future terrorism on trust levels of different types of individuals and societies, we combine individual-level survey data of the most recent World Values Survey (WVS, Round 6, 2010–2014) with several indicators at the country-level. Our findings show that social trust is principally damaged by the fear of future terrorist attacks, more so than by past terrorist attacks. Moreover, this deleterious impact of the fear of terrorism on social trust is most prevalent in more democratic countries and among individuals who are more frequently exposed to television news. Hence, with relatively limited capabilities and resources, terrorists may therefore evoke disproportionate fear effects within democratic societies which are, at least partially, fueled by media exposure.",,/r/europe/comments/e3jsgd/several_people_stabbed_on_busy_shopping_street_in/f94ilu5/,LondonSeoul,1575089501

Let me remind you a few things [Eisenhower in Ankara like a Rock star!](https://twitter.com/nsugur/status/971100398894419969?lang=da) and what happened then ? 1974 where Turkey sanctioned by US because she acted to protect Turkish minority in Cyprus that was under huge threat and no one was doing nothing. not even the UK which was the one of the three guarantors of Cyprus. Then 2003 US-TR bag incident(!) where US soldiers humiliated the Turkish soldiers by putting bags on their heads like they were terrorists in northern Iraq, because Turkey didn't allowed US to use Turkish land for their bloody invasion. And then for Europe-EU I will go with EU rather then individual relationships ; they take much poorer and less developed countries in like Bulgaria, Romania etc. they even took Cyprus in while Cyprus had literally a ""disputed"" state in it's northern part and a UN buffer zone in between yet even if it was against EU laws which states that a country can not get in while she has border disputes (which it was much more then a dispute) yet it still got in, if it was for political reasons you have Hungary(lets not even mention about the France) in EU or if it was religious reasons you have Poland there, but European hypocrisy was always on place for Turkey and EU asked dozens of chapters for to be done for Turkey which only one of them has ever closed since then. I'am not even gonna talk about the more basic one like European support of PKK and hypocritical mind set of ""my terrorists and your terrorists""...

5301,"I agree - that was my initial point. 

Europe is caught between its Eastern and Western halves, and something has to give. If they choose the side of Poland, the Baltic states and Ukraine, then they permanently ostracize Russia - if they choose Russia, then the US will happily swoop in and sunder the EU by basing US troops in the aforementioned Eastern European states to act as security guarantors against Moscow.

The original mistake was letting Eastern European states into the EU as quickly as they did - if they wanted to do that, they would have been better served inviting Russia into the EU at the same time as they invited Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. But they didn't, and now they have a dangerously disunited Europe while Russia pursues an antagonistic foreign policy, determined to secure its interests against what they see as US vassals in continental Europe. 

The best thing to do now (really, the only thing) is to make a clean break with one side or the other - choose the Baltic states, Poland and Ukraine, or choose Russia, and stick with it. Don't try that half-and-half shuffle that they're trying, with Nord Stream 2 on the one hand and sanctions on Moscow for protecting its interests on the other. That just satisfies no one, and leaves Western Europe looking indecisive and in stasis while the US builds its influence in Eastern Europe.",,/r/europe/comments/e3cojy/russia_is_no_longer_our_enemy_macron_tells_nato/f948677/,JeuneEcole,1575080236

Sure there are people *identifying* under that label that would gladly have all the Muslims killed, but they're a small minority, and should such a government be in place, it's not like Muslims would risk anything.

I could literally go out now and open a flower shop and call myself antifa. I could have my business be handing out free candy and call myself antifa.

An ""antifa government"" would be based on what, just antagonizing fascists/Nazis? It will never happen in the first place and if it did it would break apart in no time.
If you look at those small percentage of those identifying themselves as antifa and committing acts of violence, they're never *just* antifa.

5436,"&gt; I just don't understand how you can excuse this behaviour. Because Global warming can threaten coral reefs it means China is fine to dredge them to build military basses.

No. But being angry at China for destroying coral reefs of rather small islands is like being angry at a person who does things which cause a big amount of emission. I mean if you are so principled, you are free to feel like that, because you do have a point. Problem is that being angry at a person or even a big group of people is rather pointless because the biggest amount of emission is produced by large companies. China actually removing the reefs is more like a drop in the ocean, while the warming of the earth is the actual real thing which destroys must of the reefs. You can still blame China for destroying reefs, since they are since recently among the top polluters, at least in total numbers.

&gt; ""Because China has the strength to take over an area its fine"". I find this the most abhorrent thought process. And by that logic, Russia is fine to invade the Crimea, China to invade Tibet and Germany was fine to invade Poland because it was the stronger country.

Not really. Please read what I've written. Again, most islands in the SCS are claimed by everybody. Vietnam having control is as much of an ""invasion"" as China or Philippines having control, to the other country. Those islands are mostly uninhabited.

**Some of the islands have civilian settlements, but of the approximately 45 islands, cays, reefs and shoals that are occupied, all contain structures that are occupied by military forces from Malaysia, Taiwan (ROC), China (PRC), the Philippines and Vietnam.** Since all countries claim those islands somehow, by your logic every country has occupied the other country somehow.

&gt; Under literally any metric you could measure a country by - China will be the worse for all of them. From human rights abuses, to being expansionist by force and intellectual property theft China takes the cake. 

Are you sure? Wouldn't russia be more expansionist? Wouldn't the US be more devastating? Wouldn't North Korea be worse at human rights abuses? Also I assume that there are quite a bunch of countries who have worse intellectual protection laws than China, thing is that companies simply do not go there.

Also, it's not really IP theft, if it's not illegal in your country. If companies are too greedy and do not care about laws but instead care about the profit, it's kind of their problem.

&gt; Just face it, you hate America and have a lust for communism. 

Oh here we have the usual whiney accusations, because somebody contradicts the propaganda you grew up with. So apparently, I hate the US because I say USA and China are equally shitty, only with different tastes? And I want communism why exactly? Most people quite frequently say China isn't even communist, but hey, say whatever fits your narrative.

&gt; America might not be perfect, but since being the de facto world protector since 1935, America has made the world the safest it has ever been in history. 

I think you are either delusional or you are just uninformed. 

It's safest in regards to wars between powerful countries. That's mainly because of nukes, or more precisely because of MAD, since we saw that the US didn't hesitate to test out their nukes on city centers in Japan the time they got them, when MAD was not present. And since recently the intertwined economies increase the cost of fighting. Seeing you are an Australian, I understand that you like to suck up to the US, because they are basically your military, but just because the US has an alliance with you, doesn't mean you have to invent fantasies.

&gt; This peacetime is under threat by a country that will stop at nothing to become a world superpower the likes of which we haven't seen since Colonial England.

You want to tell me that China wants to build a colonial empire? Could you give me your train of thought?

Because as far as I know, the most China would do is take the stuff they claim or negotiate it out like they did with their border disputes in the north and east. So yes, Taiwan will be under Chinese rule, but I doubt they will use their military, since it's much easier to simply do US-Iran style sanctions until they join, when their economy is large enough. Other than that, they will most probably start participating in proxy wars as does the US or Russia.

5476,"The **Sajmište concentration camp** (pronounced [\[sâjmiːʃtɛ\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Serbo-Croatian)) was a [Nazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) [concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps) and [extermination camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extermination_camp) during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II). It was located at the former [Belgrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade) fairground site near the town of [Zemun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zemun), in the [Independent State of Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_State_of_Croatia) (NDH). The camp was organized and operated by SS [*Einsatzgruppen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen) units stationed in [occupied Serbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_the_Military_Commander_in_Serbia). It became operational in September 1941 and was officially opened on 28 October of that year. The Germans dubbed it the **Jewish camp in Zemun** ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): *Judenlager Semlin*). At the end of 1941 and the beginning of 1942, thousands of [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish) women, children and old men were brought to the camp, along with 500 Jewish men and 292 [Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people) women and children, most of whom were from [Niš](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C5%A1), [Smederevo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smederevo) and [Šabac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0abac). Women and children were placed in makeshift barracks and suffered during numerous influenza epidemics. Kept in squalid conditions, they were provided with inadequate amounts of food and many froze to death during the winter of 1941–42. Between March and May 1942, the Germans used a [gas van](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_gas_van) sent from [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) to kill thousands of Jewish inmates.

With the gassings complete, it was renamed **Zemun concentration camp** ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): *Anhaltelager Semlin*) and served to hold one last group of Jews who were arrested upon the [surrender of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Italy) in September 1943. During this time it also held captured [Yugoslav Partisans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Partisans), [Chetniks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chetniks), sympathizers of the Greek and Albanian resistance movements, and Serb peasants from villages in other parts of the NDH. An estimated 32,000 prisoners, mostly Serbs, passed through the camp during this period, 10,600 of whom were killed or died due to hunger and disease. Conditions in Sajmište were so poor that some began comparing it to [Jasenovac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasenovac_concentration_camp) and other large concentration camps throughout Europe. In 1943 and 1944, evidence of atrocities committed in the camp was destroyed by the units of [*SS-Standartenführer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS-Standartenf%C3%BChrer) [Paul Blobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Blobel), and thousands of corpses were exhumed from mass graves and incinerated. In May 1944, the Germans transferred control of the camp over to the NDH, and it was closed that July. Estimates of the number of deaths at Sajmište range from 20,000 to 23,000, with the number of Jewish deaths estimated at 7,000 to 10,000. It is thought that half of all Serbian Jews perished at the camp.

Most of the Germans responsible for the operation of the camp were captured and brought to trial. Several were extradited to [Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia) and executed. Camp commander Herbert Andorfer and his deputy Edgar Enge were arrested in the 1960s after many years of hiding. Both were given short prison sentences in [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany) and [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria), respectively, though Enge never served any time given his old age and poor health.

5514,"&gt;Yeah, but saying stuff like ""nato is brain dead.""

He refered to the current state of its most important member-state being wholly unpredictable in its foreign policy the past two decades and pointing to a European security project as a solution, instead of an American-dominated one. Considering how Turkey is buddying up with Russia anyways, this should literally be up Erdogan's alley. 

&gt;and trying to kick turkey out of nato helps both Erdoğan and Macron, politically.

 ""You can’t say on the one hand that we’re allies and insist on solidarity, and on the other present your allies with the fait accompli of a military intervention which endangers operations against Isis by the coalition of which Nato is a member.""

This is what he said. Which is undeniably a correct assessment. Turkey is continously using refugees as leverage against the EU and then turns around and facilitates more humanitarian crises.

&gt;I'm really tired of populist speeches of politicians contradicting each other ending up help them both. 

You don't have to like what Macron says, but he didn't go and straight up insult the leader of another country. Erdogan is in the company of Bolsonaro with this. Remember the shitstorm he raised because a German *comedian* ripped on him? Now he does it himself. Really pathetic.

&gt; I am turkish and I hope this all phase that the world is getting through including presidents insulting each other, 

Nono. Not eachother. Erdogan is the only one hurling insults at other leaders. 

&gt;We have our problems and you have yours, we really don't need one more problem which eventually come to us killing each other. 

Well, that's exactly the sort of shit that allows so many atrocities to go unpunished right now. From cliamte change, to genocides and all the way to offensive wars. The global community needs to start holding their leaders and other countries accountable, instead of succumbing to childish partisanship that stops them from accepting valid criticism from outside.

&gt; You said the IRA generally avoided targeting civilians, and yet they killed 650 of them. Targets included places like pubs, shopping streets and civilian cars. That's not exactly ""avoiding targeting civilians"".

5651,"&gt; Almost all government policies are coercive.

All government policies, at least on an international level are seen from a lens of self-interest. You will hardly find any international willing international policies which go against a country's self interest, even the ""good ones""™. Not sure about the coercive part, since there are enough situation where somebody's selfish interest is also somebody else's selfish interest, at least to a big extend.

&gt; The least thing we need right now is bigger governments, hence local democracy and free trade is my answer, which always helps both parts become prosperous.

No. Not really. Almost no country got rich during democratic rule. The vast majority of the European part which is now rich, got rich during their colonial times, when they obviously weren't democratic, at least nothing which we would call democratic now. Japan didn't not get rich when it was a democracy. South Korea got rich when it was a dictatorship as did Taiwan. One could say the US got rich while being a democracy, but they were bound to be rich, since they are practically a big continent sized island without anybody rivaling it, plus it helped massively that Europe was basically destroyed after WW2.

I agree with your free trade stance, but that contradicts your stance towards China, as having trade with China is in many ways correlated with closer ties with it.

&gt; I do not think stealing money from hard working people in Germany nor Finland will help anyone abroad. 

It's no more stealing than if people would start getting less money because of various trade wars or other geopolitical events. Which was what I mainly referred to, as it is quite likely that the US may force Europe to pick sides or at least pressure Europe to side more with the US, because as of right now the US has much more economic importance than China. And that would not have good effects on the economies of Europe.

&gt; In fact, there isn't even proof countries receiving more aid performs any better than countries getting no aid at all. Money doesn't solve systematic problems and sometimes make them worse.

There is also no proof that somehow isolating authoritarian countries makes them less authoritarian, yet you somehow advocate for that. North Korea is quite a good example. There is enough examples where isolating authoritarian countries leads to more authoritarianism though.

&gt; However, when China says Taiwan doesn't exist, Hong Kong can't have a democracy and Muslims can't have their religion nor culture,

Europe also says Abkhazia and South Ossetia doesn't exist, even though if you do even a little bit research it's quite clear most people do not want to be part of Georgia and they are for many years separate from Georgia. Or is the self-determination of Taiwan somehow conveniently more important than of Abkhazians and South Ossetians?

Also, while I'm not denying China's acts on Uighurs, but them being Muslims has not much to do with that. Uighurs live on land which is geopolitically important plus it has oil. Uighurs want or at least wanted independence. Everything can be explained without adding ethnicity or religion, but I assume it's not as captivating than just saying ""China does fucked up shit to minorities because they inhabit geopolitically important land which they wanted to separate from China"".

&gt;  that is when we put sanctions on the people in charge just as we did with Russia. That is exactly what USA did.

Not really. We did put up sanctions on Russia, because it's not as economically important to the European economy. Prime example is that we did not put any sanctions on the US when they invaded Iraq which in the end cost half a million lives. Not sure about you, but personally I find it worse killing half a million people than Russia illegally annexing land whose people want to be part of Russia anyways. Because of the same reasons, Europe won't do anything major towards China, as China's economy is just too important, similar to the USA's economy.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/e2oj39/pew_survey_germans_more_supportive_of_closer_ties/f93gr08/,CDWEBI,1575058638

Ergo they have interests beyond massacring us *and even if* that's just the continuation of the Russian state, so be it. You can negotiate with states and nations that value their continued existence.

This is not a trivial or facetious point. If ISIS had the nuclear arsenal Russia had they would fire it immediately because they have genuine conviction they're going to the afterlife and do not value themselves in the flesh. There are gradations of threat to this continent.

5694,"Actually no, there's no provision to expel a member, although only the US could force something like de Gaulle withdrawing troops temporarily from NATO since America is the gang leader.   
   
Honestly, being a non-member would work better for Turkey. Do you think in your child-brain that once Turkey leaves the organization it's no longer protected by the organization?   
  
Newsflash: Turkey is already not protected by the organization. While the US activated the article 5 against Afghanistan by claiming that Al Qaida attacked twin towers and kiled a few thousand people while people in Europe lit candles and cried, while PKK has been attacking Turkish cities and has killed thousands of people and all NATO countries did was to reprimand Turkey's fight against terrorism, enforce sanctions and help the terror group (except in 1997 the US special forces captured and handed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and European countries like Germany and France had to keep quiet like two lapdogs because they can't reprimand the US daddy and Israel little daddy even if they invade countries and kill tens of thousands of people).   
    
So what's going to happen if Turkey decides to leave NATO. You think, in your child brain that the US will allow Turkey to walk into Russia's and China's camp? 

If Turkey and US parts ways, the US will lose access to bases in Turkey and in case of a crisis, easy access to Bosphorus and Blacksea. They'll also lose missile defense and early warning radars which protect your ass and Israel from possible missile attacks. When that happens, do you think in your child brain that the US will attack and invade Turkey? No. Turkey will fight back and that'll be a different proposition than Iraq or Syria, and Russia will also help Turkey, not because Russians love Turkey so much but because if the US invades Turkey and Turkey falls (a nightmare refugee problem for Germany), the US would get unlimited access to Bosphorus and Turkey's [entire Blacksea coast directly facing Russia, Crimea, Ukraine and neighbors to Georgia while also connecting Romania and Bulgaria](https://i.ibb.co/DMmLcbJ/turkeyblacksea.png) which would be a nightmare scenario and a direct national security threat to Russia. They'll do everything to help Turkey to make sure Turkey doesn't fall. 
   
Alternatively, the US will work to keep Turkey on her side. 
   
Baby, Turkey leaving NATO is not a blessing for your German ass. It's rather a curse because you don't want Turkey as an enemy next to your other enemies. Turkey was your ally even when your current buddies were your enemies before they humiliated your country in Versailles and starved your people to death, forced your women into prostitution.

US healthcare system is best in the world and it is pumping more patents for new drugs and care than anyone else in world.

Without their system you wouldn't be even as healthy as today because most of the drugs get tested etc. in US system first where they have money for expensive drugs.

Secondly US does have issues with its healthcare system. Mainly socialist took over it and managed to force people to use only insurers from their states. If there is cheap insurer from california you can't buy it if you live in ohio.

Moreover they want to replace that system with even more socialism where they want one state insurer or just one insurer overall which is proposal of few democratic candidates.

Not only they have socialism for companies but also regulations where hospitals can't buy cheaper drugs from abroad.

In practical terms standard of living is the main stuff the vast majority of people care about. Not sure what you are on about.

5851,"**German authors: Poland can demand a reparation**

The German government considers the matter of reparations for Poland and Greece to be finally settled. Two German authors believe that Berlin's position is legally unjustified and irresponsible.

German historian Stephan Lehnstaedt writes about Karl Heinz Roth's and Hartmut Ruebner's book on reparations for Poland and Greece in Tuesday's Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Will Poland bill Germany for war losses? - he asks.

The historian reminds us that the Law and Justice party discovered this subject some time ago and is constantly returning to it, recently during the celebrations of the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising and the outbreak of World War II. The Polish government has not yet given any figures; speculation fluctuates between 800 billion euros and two trillions. In Germany - the historian points out - the prevailing opinion is that claims serve to arouse emotions in Polish domestic politics and are devoid of any legal basis.

Roth and Rueber describe the German position as ""legally unjustified"" and ""historically and politically irresponsible"". The authors, after consultation with international law expert Andreas Fischer-Lescano, come to the conclusion that Poland can definitely demand a reparation.

In their opinion, the resignation from reparations announced by the People's Republic of Poland in 1953 concerned only the GDR and not the whole of Germany. The 1990 treaty 2+4 on German reunification was not a peace treaty, and only such a treaty could finally close the issue of reparations. The interstate law does not know the statute of limitations - adds Lehnstaedt, presenting the arguments of the authors of the book. In his opinion only an international court will be able to resolve the issue of reparations in the future.

**German crumbs for victims**

According to the historian, Germany's position on reparations over the past 70 years, as described in detail by the authors of the publication, is embarrassing. The German authorities handed over ""crumbs"" to the victims of Nazi violence, only ""after stubborn persistance and bureaucratic and legal tricks"".

1,060,689 Polish beneficiaries - former prisoners, forced laborers and other persecuted people received an average of 405 marks for the first time in 1995. This is an ""embarrassing sum"" - as we read in SZ. The authors estimated the value of the Western Lands granted to Poland as a result of World War II at 157.5 billion euros. This is not a small sum, but ""almost nothing"" in comparison to the financial consequences of German crimes in the years 1939-1945.

**Estimates of losses**

Roth and Ruebner estimated the losses resulting from German crimes in Poland - murders, exploitation and destruction - at EUR 1.182 billion. After deducting the benefits paid, in the case of Poland 87% of this sum remains to be paid. On the scale of the whole Europe, war losses, taking into account the damage in the Soviet Union, exceed, in their opinion, 7.5 trillion euro.

The authors point to a glaring injustice: Germany has paid 950 billion euros in compensation since 1945, but more than four-fifths of that sum was paid to German citizens, who account for less than five percent of all victims.

**Reparations - an act of social justice?**

""The Germans murdered millions of people, destroyed their foundations of life, plundered their culture and made a cheap mockery of it."" - writes Lehnstaedt. Roth and Rueber are in favour of doubling the amount paid so far (950 billion euros), which in their opinion would be an ""act of social justice"".

The authors believe that the combined actions of the former ""small allies"" and Russia may constitute a strong international pressure on Germany.

""Instead of waiting for a 'biological solution' to the problem, many warm words of apology should be followed by financial actions"" - writes Lehnstaedt and recalls that there are still about 40,000 victims of German crimes in Poland, who so far have received only alms.

&gt;The proposal has cross-party support in the country and stands a chance of passing. A Focus agency opinion poll in September found 55.5 per cent of people disagreed with restricting abortions while 34.6 per cent supported the move.

So the majority of people is against this. The general population is about half made up of women, while only **20%** of seats in Slovakia's parliament are held by women! So cross-party support, eh? By old men, just OP said.

I don't appreciate your agressive way of arguing strawmen here, btw. If it's the woman's decision (as you claim) why try to stir her one way or the other then? It's one of those typical reddit discussion on women's issues again. You realize you have no right to decide but you still want to be part of the discussion. Well, since abortions are apparently up to the women (even though it's ok for men to pass laws trying to manipulate their decision), the act of conceiving is not. Make men watch educational films about abortion, childbirth and responsible parenting before they're allowed to stick their dick in anything.
