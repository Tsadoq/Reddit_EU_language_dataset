168,"Living in NZ, I think the success was from four key things:

1 - we could see the cluster fuck start overseas first (really just a two week lag)

2 - the govt had the balls to implement an extremely harsh lockdown before things got too crazy

3 - the govt almost always took the advice from health experts on what to do

4 - the level of trust in the govt was huge, due to clear communication and the fact the case numbers soon tracked down, compared to going up elsewhere

Lots of other little factors too.

There is no incentive for the ""basic"" users (that dont care about privacy issues, which should be taught about in schools nowadays btw) to use the second biggest platform because they would lose capital or potential, wether that is financial or social.

So to counteract the monopolisation somewhat, there is a need for a common standard system that is provided by the government that allows cross platform communication. Such system is extremly complicated to introduce or even to develop. And banning people out of that system should only be possible with legislative procedures that need to be streamlined to not overwhelm the courts.

Apart from all that we should stop giving a small amount of people so much money, that they could live thousands of ""high living standart lifes"" with, while thousands of other people starve to death.

263,"&gt;This is really the laziest reply I have seen

Offended? You are the one to reply to my post with merely a quotation from the Wikipedia and just that, which is the definition of lazy. 

&gt;The Slavs were definitely not some terrified chickens cowering before the almighty Byzantine army. My previous comment already mentioned the multiple sieges of Thessaloniki, or the massive Slavic uprisings in the 8th century.

Why are you annoyed again? If you have a problem with anyone, blame Maurice for his *Strategika* or Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos for his *De Administratio Imperio (Or Pros ton Ion Romanon).* It is them that describe this very situation, which is often presented in textbooks of International Strategies as examples of flexibility by both sides, the Slavs in adopting guerrila warfare or hit-and-run, since they did not pocess the sofistication nor the tactics to directly confront the Roman Army, and the latter to do the same to coutner this countering strategy. (And nowhere did I say that this was cowardly, that was your perception of that, you chose to be offended). 

Not to mention that if they were so strong and powerful, dominating the Hellenic Mainland, why did they engage in such tactics, and why would they only occationaly raid and not simply annex the land? And since you present the Slavic Sieges of Thessalonika (which were always failed), why did they only attempt them when the main Roman Army was away, busy fighting of a much more dangerous foe? Take for example the Sieges of Thessalonika in 615 AD and 617 AD, by Avars, Bulgars and Slavs, which was done when the Roman Emperor Heraclius was campaigning the Armenian Highlands, the Caucasus and the Iranian Highlands, destroying the Iranian Sassanid Empire's power like an other Alexander. Or the Siege of Thessalonika in 676‚Äì678 AD, when the Roman Emperor Constantine VI was busy in the Arab Siege of Constantinople, and his war against the Arabs since 672 AD. This does not display such great power from the part of the Slavs, attacking only when the enemy faces stronger foes, and when he defeats them to run back to their secluded fortified villages (Sklavinies). 

And again, it is not as if Greece was an abandoned region, for which the Roman Emperors of New Rome did not care at all and let it be raided by foreginers, not as if it was depopulated and desolated. It was one of the most populated and urbanized regions in the Roman State. It is not a surprise that the Themes, based on military agriculture, was originally installed in the Asia Minor, with fewer townships and more focused in the cultivation of the vast expance, and not in Greece, which became instead a Naval Theme. 

And the Eparchy of Hellas (only Central Greece and Peloponnese) during the time of Justinian I the Great, just half a century before the arrival of the Slavs, had the highest number of cities (79), while the average per eparhy for the empire was just 14! Which based on modern estimations, was around 2.500.000 people, while with the rest of Modern Greece, there were 230 townships with  6.150.000 inhabitants. These numbers are presented in Synecdemus of Hierocles, the geographic and administrative census of 530 AD. Comparably, the numers the nomadic and divided Slavs could have come with were some hundred thousands, and they did not dominate over the Roman Greeks, like say the Franks did over the Roman Gauls in order to assimilate them to their culture. In fact it is the opposite that occured here, with the Roman Greeks forcing the Slavs to be assimilated into their civilization, since they were the invaders and foreigners to their lands. 

&gt;Here's another source exploring the power of these Slavic tribes, turns out it was the Greeks who had to hide from them.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://brill.com/view/book/edcoll/9789004425613/BP000004.xml](https://brill.com/view/book/edcoll/9789004425613/BP000004.xml)

And am I supposed to answer to you or to the source? If so then I shall do the same. But with original sources, which are the onces least edited and misinterpreted, since if one could trust every text then even cite  Fallmerayer's absurb theories that virtually all Modern Greeks are not Greeks but instead Slavs, and that the Medieval Greeks of Mailand Greece were exterminated by the latter. And no, the amount of slavic toponyms is too low to suggest that they dominated (tens or dozens), just see how many Italian and French are in Greece, when they really did (hundreds). There was a Frankokratia, but not a Slavokratia. And even still, what are those compared to the thousands of Greek toponyms for Greece? 

I could go on and on showing historical recordins that demonstrate that during this time Greece was considered to be inhabited by Greeks, or that there are archaeologic remains that show that, and not a Slavic Domination.

So people were highly encouraged and even paid gold to have a certain number of kids. So the mentality is much different. War times and loss of life during war also drives the need for making more babies.

I don't buy it. ""We exchange messages by writing them on the walls of your house, so now it's your obligation to make the wall easily accessible for us"" is not a valid argument.

&gt; It's arguably the best way to get information out in the modern age as it's free, easily accessible and widely used.

This sentence barely has any word of truth. Social networks are not the best way to get information, and they are only relatively free -- if you don't pay with your money, you pay with something else, and you DO pay, as running the infrastructure costs a lot of money and the companies are not out of business. Hell, even if it were true, the fact that you receive something for free doesn't entitle you to receiving it for free forever.

&gt; 
&gt; Would you want e.g. the judicial system or the fire brigade to be privatized?

even with functioning democracy you would end with all media under control of smaller amount of group of interest than in current situation. If you end with 51% government it can could have control over 100% of media. 

Why Europe democracy is not bad, one of reason is that media are not under direct government control.

this is true but by having free market of social media you ensure there are variety of sites, If you would nationalize it you end with what? 1 site? or multiple sites under control of one entity? 

&gt;You can't even start your own twitter to compete due to copyright and patents, 

It is complete nonsense.  

new social media can appear at any time. Nothing stop you from starting 2nd twitter (well you cant name it 2nd twiter), there is no patent for social media. If you cant open 2nd twitter how twiter even appeared?  Was parlor closed because it broke some patent law?

703,"Just like how the guy before me pointed it out, the Linke is not a communist party.

They actively put themselves against the left-extremists, saying that the government needs to take more actions on extremism.

On the other hand the AFD formally even propagates right-wing extremist ideologies, demanding the execution of refugees, argumenting with conspiracy theories, actually calling for a hunt of the chancellor, wanting to shut down gender-research which is against the constitution and loads of other shit.

Not to mention that their ""rechter fl√ºgel"" group was broken up by the constitution-protective kommission because it was far too violent and had too much radical nazis in it.

But did the AFD get rid of them? No they didnt, they integrated the ""rechter fl√ºgel"" into their party.
They didnt even THINK of throwing those extremists out.



Do you now get why the AFD is extremistic while the Linke is not?
Or do I have to quote AFD leading politicians to prove my point?


""So when the AFD is at power germany will become nazi-germany again but when the left rules its not communistic? Such hypocrisy!""

That may be because the AFD has backings of radical terrorist groups and openly embraces the ""querdenker"" protesters who're just like the ones that invaded the capitol in the US.
...which the ""querdenker"" did too back in august to the ""reichstag"" in berlin.

The Linke has no such radical backing.
There were scandals too you know, but they were quickly condemned by the lead and even thrown out of the party in some cases.

...unlike the AFD which actively kept the radicals.

So its not hard to imagine that a power grab could happen once the AFD gets into power.
Hitler did it similarly when he got elected.

And when holocaust survivors spoke up to the rise of the AFD they specifically said that they were reminded of the NSDAP and the rise of the nazis saying ""this had started the exact same way""(""das hat damals auch so angefangen"").

One side of the argument doesn't want to evaluate if inciting violence is bad, that part is omitted because it is already a premise, it is an argument about who is allowed to classify anything as such and about the personal responsibility of the actual perpetrator.

Companies like to keep a clean image, so to give them incentive to clean anything that could be perceived negatively is a huge threat to freedom of speech as long as more and more discourse happens online. Even more true if you actually care about minorities, which would be the last that have any influence on content removal decisions.

Of course companies are and should be legally allowed to ban anything they want, it is even a fundamental right of theirs.

I thought this might add to the discussion. From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia\_(country)#Etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)#Etymology):

&gt;""Georgia"" probably stems from the Persian designation of the Georgians ‚Äì gurƒüƒÅn, in the 11th and 12th centuries adapted via Syriac gurz-ƒÅn/gurz-iyƒÅn and Arabic ƒµurƒµan/ƒµurzan. Lore-based theories were given by the traveller Jacques de Vitry, who explained the name's origin by the popularity of St. George amongst Georgians,\[13\] while traveller Jean Chardin thought that ""Georgia"" came from Greek Œ≥ŒµœâœÅŒ≥œåœÇ (""tiller of the land""). As Prof. Alexander Mikaberidze adds, these century-old explanations for the word Georgia/Georgians are rejected by the scholarly community, who point to the Persian word gurƒü/gurƒüƒÅn (""wolf""\[14\]) as the root of the word.\[15\] Starting with the Persian word gurƒü/gurƒüƒÅn, the word was later adopted in numerous other languages, including Slavic and West European languages.\[15\]\[16\] This term itself might have been established through the ancient Iranian appellation of the near-Caspian region, which was referred to as Gorgan (""land of the wolves"").\[15\]\[17\]

&gt; The head of the OBZ was Bedrich Reicin, who harbored a grudge against P√≠ka dating back several years when the two served together in the Soviet Union.

How is that a civil war? That's like calling fake Facebook bots ""social media users"". True on a very technical level (there is a person behind that keyboard, after all), but including them in the definition renders the entire concept rather useless.

Strong currency also encourages to buy stuff from cheaper countries, hurting the local economy even more.

No border checks: I can't imagine a single thing why this would be a good idea. Criminals, illegal drugs, illegal aliens and weapons (see swedens hand grenade attacks/detonations) can freely move between countries without anyone stopping them.

793,"Twitter applies it's rules very selectively, because those who choose to judge if the rules are followed or not are biased. So yes, death threats or support of violence is sometimes allowed even on twitter or facebook. And big tech companies you mentioned are technically acting like an Oligopoly in cases like this, which is troubling. They should not have that much power over our lives. 

Technically, politicians who are banned from using their services are still able to get their message out, but it will not be amplified nowhere to the same extent as the message of those who those companies allow on their platform. Which can make more than enough difference to change the election results. So it is a real threat to democracy leaving these companies ability to ban politicians, if they choose that what they are saying is against their tos. 

These tech companies are not just any companies, they technically became a public forum where majority of our communication is taking place. Everyone has to have access to that. If someone is breaking the law, they should be sued. If they are not breaking the law, they should be able to stay. 

There is also a problem of dictatorships, who will used this as an additional excuse to silence their political opposition even more than they are doing it now. Because if they can do it in US, why should not they be able to do it in their own country? Trump might deserve to be banned, but you should still refuse to do so on the principle.

2.4 million vaccinated as of today, which is approximately 3.6% of Brits. Everything is riding on the vaccine. 80 million of the 100 million on order are being manufactured in the UK so hopefully there won‚Äôt be any disruption in transport.

Brexit negatives: paperwork for cross border businesses is confusing a lot of businesses both sides of the channel, and has resulted in some spoiled fish shipments and slow down in business.

From the piece: ‚ÄúThe German Chancellor said that freedom of opinion should not be determined by those running online platforms‚Äù. 
Trump‚Äôs freedom of opinion has not been affected in any way. His ability to convey his opinion, that‚Äôs another matter.

However, unlike most of us, he has a press room where he can talk to the media and staff whose job is specifically to communicate his opinions to the rest of the world. 

Media companies are private organisations and so they can set their own terms of usage. Anyone breaking these terms should not be surprised if they lose access to that platform. Many would argue trump should have been denied his personal account a long time ago but for whatever reasons this has not happened till now. 

It appears trump has broken multiple state and federal laws - most recently and most disturbingly, the call to his followers to storm the Capitol. I think it quite likely his followers will not rest at what they have already done and we are likely to see more acts of domestic terrorism before and after the transition of power.

1155,"Throughout the third quarter 2020, the labour market across the European Union (EU) recovered to some extent as COVID-19 measures taken were relaxed by most Member States. Persons who had been temporarily absent from work thus returned to work, and those who had been unable to search for a job or had been unavailable to take up a job returned to the labour force. This has contributed to an increase in both employment and unemployment, and to a slight decrease of the overall labour market slack.

In this release, Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, is publishing a set of seasonally adjusted quarterly indicators in addition to employment and unemployment which help to capture the most recent movements on the labour market in the EU Member States. These include total labour market slack, which comprises all persons who have an unmet need for employment, absences from work as well as an index of total actual hours worked in the main job. More new indicators on recent job leavers and starters, weekly total absences, as well as transitions are available in the Eurostat database.

**Employment up, labour market slack down**

In the third quarter of 2020, 188.0 million persons in the EU were employed. The EU seasonally adjusted employment rate for people aged 20-64 stood at 72.4%, up by 0.3 pp from 72.1% in the second quarter 2020. 14.8 million persons were unemployed. The EU seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 7.3%, up from 6.7% in the second quarter 2020. At the same time, seasonally adjusted total labour market slack in the EU, consisting in unmet need for work, amounted to 29.4 million persons, which represented 13.9% of the extended labour force in the third quarter 2020, slightly down from 14.1% in the second quarter 2020.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/kv1ic3/total_labour_market_slack_drops_slightly_to_139/giveata/,filosoful,1610367362

1230,"I just think it's difficult to check now because two weeks of covid vaccine news have gone by and older articles and data are difficult to find.

What I do know for sure is that Italy got 9750 doses on the 26th of december and they had to make do with that until the 470.000 that were delivered between the 30th and the 31st of december.

This is actually the cause of this whole debate between Italian and German redditors here.

The Italian vaccination plan got one week of delay because the weekly doses were late to arrive and by new year's eve the government was costantly attacked for their ""bad management"" of the situation (the doses were shipped late by Pfizer because of the weather, so nothing to do about it).

Our PM was asked during a press conference on the 31st why we had only had less than 10.000 vaccinations while Germany had already received 150k on the first day and he just answered saying that he didn't know, that it was the european plan to just deliver about 9750 doses to every member state on the 26th as a ""symbolic number"", that we were waiting for the delayed shipment and that there was that agreement about not buying doses by Pfizer during the negotiations so Germany's numbers seemed a bit weird and they had to check with the German health minister to ask what had happened there.

Apparently the answer was that Germany had received a big part of their weekly doses much earlier and started using them, which was not possible for Italy as we had received nothing yet.

A German redditor posted a out of context quote by this press conference saying that our PM was accusing them of buying vaccines breaking the agreement, which was bullshit as he had said nothing like that, but whatever.

So here's the full story of how there's a bit of German-Italian hostility here about vaccinations.",,/r/europe/comments/kuhkpo/italy_now_leading_in_number_of_covid_vaccinations/giv2eyt/,nymeriasgloves,1610359872

Probably, if things keep going the way they do. That does not mean Russia is going to accept it. That's a typical cause of conflict.

&gt;Thats why I'm saying they'll come to a compromise of some sort to agree spheres of influence. Russia knows its powerless against EU/NATO (especially if EU continues to federalise) and will take what other regions it can get in its own pet project (EAEU).

The whole concept of ""spheres of influence"" is a relic of the imperial 19th century and really doesn't fit in the current position on international sovereignty that is supported by the West in general.

1310,"&gt;Yeah I've lived in Karabakh for 3 years. And what a bad-luck, I've lived enough to see ""Khojaly tragedy""    

That's truly awful, and I'm sorry to hear that. Nothing else to say really, regardless of who one thinks is right in the conflict it's fucking awful to be displaced to your home. 
  
&gt; I don't say defending your own country is wrong, I made that statement cause you're so far away from this fight and having nothing in common, you sound like the Turks live in Germany which i hate cause they don't know the shitstorm that's going cause of the erdogan government.  
  
I visit Armenia almost every year and have visited Artsakh/Karabakh as well, and have actively sought out to learn as much as possible about the conflict. This isn't just from the Armenian narrative, but I've spoken with Azerbaijanis as well and done my best to learn their perspective and understand the truth. Thus I don't think it's right to say I have nothing in common. But regardless, even for many of the Armenians in the diaspora who haven't done their research like I have, they see Armenians under persecution and want them to be able to live happily, which is why they speak out about the injustices. It's not right to call for military action or whatever when you are not the one putting your life on the line, but otherwise everyone has a valid voice about this.  
  
&gt;Armenia do bad thing, diespora of yours starts to crying about everything, and trying to hide under wrong historic facts.    

The reason we always bring up the historical facts is because those historical facts were never addressed. You can draw a direct line between the Armenian Genocide in 1915 and what is happening today. Azerbaijanis and Turks have been brainwashed into believing that we deserved whatever happened in 1915, and that we've been making false claims about their countries for the last 100 years, when the opposite is true. From our perspective, we are being continuously wiped out from one area to a next; the places where Armenians live keeps shrinking and shrinking. Just this year Armenians got forced out of Hadrut and other areas in the NKAO, areas where Armenians have lived for thousands of years and will likely now never live in again. Our churches and historical monuments will be destroyed and our history erased. It's an ongoing cycle.  
  
Now you said you lived in Karabakh, so I am assuming you were forced out. Do you understand why the war happened in 90's happened the first place? The provinces outside the NKAO would never have been touched if Azerbaijan had allowed the NKAO Armenians to peacefully join Armenia, and in fact those Armenians would never have wanted to secede in the first place if Azerbaijan's government had treated them well and hadn't suppressed their identity and tried to change the demographics of the region. Following the war, when Armenia took over the NKAO and the surrounding districts, the Armenian government wanted to trade the surrounding districts back to Azerbaijan in return for Azerbaijan relinquishing claims to the NKAO. Wouldn't having letting the NKAO go before the first war even happened been better than going through the entire first and second war? And even after the first war happened, wouldn't it have been better to just exchange the NKAO for the surrounding districts and be done with it? I don't understand why any of us needed this. So much bloodshed over nothing. You could have returned to your home 30 years ago and nobody would have died. I'm kinda ranting here but I truly want to understanding if Azerbaijanis think all this suffering was worth it just so they can keep the NKAO.",Armenian American,/r/europe/comments/kut7z9/this_is_a_postage_stamp_just_released_by/giuszni/,CrazedZombie,1610352330

1388,"&gt; This map is terribly innacurate concerning Greece.

It's not?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclaveni

&gt;By the 580s, as the Slav communities on the Danube became larger and more organised, and as the Avars exerted their influence, raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement. By 586, they managed to raid the western Peloponnese, Attica, Epirus, leaving only the east part of Peloponnese, which was mountainous and inaccessible. In 586 AD, as many as 100,000 Slav warriors raided Thessaloniki.

&gt;In 615, during the reign of Heraclius (r. 610‚Äì641), the whole Balkans was regarded as Sklavinia ‚Äì inhabited or controlled by Slavs. Chatzon led the Slavic attack on Thessaloniki that year. The Slavs asked the Avars for aid, resulting in an unsuccessful siege (617). In 626, Sassanids, Avars and Slavs joined forces and unsuccessfully besieged Constantinople. During the same year of the siege, the Sclaveni used their monoxyla in order to transport the 3,000 troops of the allied Sassanids across the Bosphorus which the latter had promised the khagan of the Avars. In 630, Sclaveni attempted to take Thessaloniki again.

&gt;In 783, a large Slavic uprising took place in the Byzantine Empire, stretching from Macedonia to the Peloponnese, which was subsequently quelled by Byzantine patrikios Staurakios (fl. 781‚Äì800). Dalmatia, inhabited by Slavs in the interior, at this time, had firm relations with Byzantium. In 799, Akameros, a Slavic archon, participated in the conspiracy against Empress Irene of Athens.

&gt;A number of medieval sources attest to the presence of Slavs in Greece. While en route to the Holy Land in 732, Willibald **""reached the city of Monemvasia, in the land of Slavinia""**. This particular passage from the Vita Willibaldi is interpreted as an indication of a Slavic presence in the hinterland of the Peloponnese. In reference to the plague of 744‚Äì747, Constantine VII wrote during the 10th century that ""the entire country [of the Peloponnese] was Slavonized""

&gt;Max Vasmer, a prominent linguist and Indo-Europeanist, complements late medieval historical accounts by listing 429 Slavic toponyms from the Peloponnese alone.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/kugpyi/slavic_tribes_600900_ad/giuvc1a/,Canal_Volphied,1610353918

I mean recent years we've seen reports of snow in Egypt, right now in Spain but snow is getting less common in The Netherlands.

1528,"&gt;*Even without seeing detailed trial data, there are reasons to be confident in the Sputnik V shot. The same can‚Äôt be said yet for China‚Äôs CoronaVac vaccine. By Sam Fazeli*  
&gt;  
&gt;When it comes to Covid-19 vaccines, a lot of attention seems to have centered on the ones being made in the West. So it may come as a surprise that Russia is fifth on the list of vaccine makers with the most doses under contract through¬†pre-purchase agreements, according to¬†[Bloomberg‚Äôs Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/#dvz-section-purchasing). The shot ‚Äî whimsically named Sputnik V and developed by the Gamaleya institute ‚Äî¬†is just behind GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Sanofi‚Äôs candidate in the rankings and ahead of the shots developed by Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson. This is notable for a vaccine that has yet to be featured in any peer-reviewed scientific journal. How do we know we can trust it?  
&gt;  
&gt;Russia hasn‚Äôt released late-stage phase III data on its vaccine; all we have to go on are press announcements, similar to the situation with the Chinese shot made by Sinovac Biotech Ltd. The assumption is that regional¬†health authorities have approved the Russian vaccine¬†based on good efficacy and safety data, but there is no way of independently verifying these things without actually seeing it ourselves. That said, what we do know about Sputnik V and its design should give us some degree of confidence.  
&gt;  
&gt;What‚Äôs known: The Sputnik V has been tested in a phase III trial involving 22,714 subjects, with three interim analyses when the number of confirmed cases reached 20, 39 and 78, respectively. While the final number of cases is lower than that in the Moderna and Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine trials, those were larger and conducted in the U.S., where the infection rates were rising rapidly. Efficacy at each interim analysis¬†in the Sputnik V trial was consistently at 90% or above, based on comments in press releases. There were also no cases of severe Covid-19 in vaccinated individuals, though definitions of disease severity are not clear.  
&gt;  
&gt;As for its design, Sputnik V was developed using the kind of advanced vaccine technology employed in shots made by the AstraZeneca-Oxford University partnership and Johnson &amp; Johnson. These two-dose vaccines use adenoviral vectors -- viruses based on the cause of the common cold that are engineered to deliver the genetic material coding for the Sars-Cov-2‚Äôs key ‚Äúspike‚Äù protein, which in turn prompts the immune system to mount¬†a response to protect against further infections.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sputnik V has one key, clever¬†difference from¬†the Astra and J&amp;J vaccines: It uses the same adenovirus as J&amp;J for the first dose (adenovirus-26) and a different adenovirus (adenovirus-5) for the second dose. In this way, it avoids the possibility of immunity to the first dose impacting the ability of the second dose to work efficiently. One issue is that a large percentage of people have pre-existing immunity to adenovirus-5, but that‚Äôs not a huge drawback if the efficacy is very high. A potentially more promising alternative would be to try a combination of adenovirus-26 for the first shot and Astra‚Äôs adenoviral vector ‚Äì made from a chimp adenovirus ‚Äì for the second, which is exactly what the two groups have agreed to do in a collaboration announced on Dec.11.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;Taken together, these details ‚Äì even without the phase III results ‚Äì give me reason to think the Sputnik V vaccine may well be as strong a candidate as the ones created in Western labs. The same can‚Äôt be said for Sinovac‚Äôs shot, CoronaVac, which is undergoing trials in Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia.  
&gt;  
&gt;Phase III efficacy data for the CoronaVac shot has been all over the place ‚Äì from 50% to more than 90% - with different numbers coming from different authorities in recent weeks. On Thursday, a Brazilian newspaper reported efficacy for the shot of 78%, adding to the confusion. This opacity does not help confidence in the vaccine**.** Then there is the question of the technology base. CoronaVac uses killed virus in its vaccine, mixed with a traditional adjuvant called alum. It‚Äôs similar to the shot¬†in development by French biotech firm Valneva SE, though the latter uses a potentially more powerful adjuvant from its partnership with California-based Dynavax Technologies Corp.¬†While both may have the theoretical advantage of inducing an immune response to other parts of the virus than just the spike protein, which is the target of¬†most other vaccines, the choice of an old adjuvant for the Sinovac shot¬†is not great.  
&gt;  
&gt;At some point, I hope¬†soon, the phase III data for the Sputnik V and CoronaVac vaccines will be published in a peer-reviewed journal so that we can make up our own minds about the robustness of their efficacy and safety. As of now, though ‚Äî¬†and based on what I know so far ‚Äî¬†if I had to choose between the two, I would opt for a¬†ride on Sputnik rather than a trip to CoronaVac‚Äôs golden stars.",Moscow (Russia),/r/europe/comments/kuvfye/would_you_take_russias_covid19_vaccine/giucc24/,Avroveks,1610340513

&gt;  
&gt;Every time people have been sceptical about the targets Hancock has set he's met them.

The health minister shifted the goalposts slightly, he was [found](https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-test-targets/) not to be meeting his testing targets, and then loosened his definitions so that testing capacity was defined in ways increasingly divorced from ""did we apply a test to an actual person and get a result of whether or not they had coronavirus.

He was sent a rather [politely worded](https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/sir-david-norgrove-letter-to-matt-hancock-regarding-covid-19-testing/) but uncommon letter from the head of the UK statistical authority, asking for more clarity on how exactly he was now defining his targets, and he replied by saying that he was simply trying to determine potential capacity of available tests, regardless of organisational or practical issues that might mean they might not be able to actually use them, making it a matter of inventory management rather than tracking how many tests were actually being done and how fast.

As was [observed](https://fullfact.org/health/six-test-targets/), his targets became hit more and more on technicalities, until the point where there was not any way to argue they were being hit.",,/r/europe/comments/kucwzk/covid19_every_uk_adult_to_be_offered_vaccine_by/giud6qo/,eliminating_coasts,1610341031

‚Ä¢ The reported cases aren‚Äôt particularly increasing even though lots of people broke the ‚Äúrules‚Äù during the holiday season.

1672,"&gt; The Dutch constitution can be ignored whenever you want because of article 120.

That's kind of true but in practice not really, it's actually really interesting how it works to me at least. What article 120 says is that judges can't test if laws are constitutional or not. Whenever the constitution refers to laws it means formal laws, which are laws made by the Chambers and the Government together(regering en Staten Generaal gezamenlijk). Judges can still test if other 'laws' such as Algemene Maatregelen van Bestuur(AMVBs) issued by just the government, ministerial regulations issued by a minister, or ordinances issued by the provinces, water authorities or councils are constitutional. A lot of Dutch law can thus still be tested by judges.

It's actually this article 120 that can be ignored even, because of article 94. This article says that if a law is in conflict with a treaty, the law doesn't apply. That means that while judges can't test if laws are constitutional, they can test if they are in conflict with a treaty. Because the Netherlands have signed human rights treaties like the European Convention on Human Rights(Europees Verdrag voor de Rechten van de Mens/EVRM in Dutch), the human rights in the constitution are still covered. In this case it would be article 11 EVRM that covers freedom of assembly, article 9 EVRM covers freedom of religion among others.

1713,"I understand OBEs are decided by governmental committees, and thus are not a direct accolade from the monarchy. However these things are symbolic and important. They legitamise the monarchy and (arguably) glorify them.

If these accolades are decided at a governmental level, why do we include the monarchy? And let's remember what OBE stands for - we're explicitly harking back to imperialism and colonialism with these titles.

The history of the monarchy, especially in the case of the Celtic lands, is defined by subjugation and conquest. Land was taken, titles were usurped, languages destroyed, people enslaved. All by monarchy, all by imperialism.

The monarchy may no longer have any 'official' power in the state. But their continued involvement in political ceremony, the handing out of accolades. Titles like the 'Prince of Wales', the idea of the King or Queen being 'Head of State'. These things are now considered quaint bits of modern life in Britain - but that perception dilutes the bloody history of this institution.

For Sheen to have reached this realisation, and hand back an accolade -- given to him in a ceremony that dilutes the truth, by an institution that benefits from that dilution -- is in my opinion an effective gesture. I only wish he could have thought on this before accepting the OBE in the first place.

And I don't think your comparison is accurate in this case. If you want to reform an institution, then obviously you need to remain engaged with it, I agree. However, if you reject an institution's involvement in your political system altogether, then it's more effective to reject that institution publicly (as Sheen as done), but stay involved with the parts of the system you accept. Sheen seems to have been involved in activism for Wales, and shows a lot of pride in his hometown.

Really? I would think that those would be in Anatolia or Istanbul. What landmarks in Central Asia are important?

Those (Ararat, Van,...) landmarks would be very important for Turks, if you guys actually lived there too. For example Van Lake is also very symbolic for Kurds or Assyrians, because they lived/live there too. I'm sure the locals Turks/Azeris in Igdir have local folklore too around Ararat or Van.

2201,"The complete renovation of St. Mary's Basilica in Gdansk has just been completed. The investment was carried out in 2017-2020 and its cost was nearly 20 million PLN. These were the biggest conservation works in the church since its reconstruction in the first years after World War II.

On December 6, 2015, Father Ireneusz Bradtke became parish priest of St. Mary's Basilica in Gdansk. When he assumed this function, the technical condition of the temple - to put it mildly - left much to be desired.

Specialists from the Gdansk University of Technology left no doubt that the renovation, or rather reconstruction of the roof, which not only leaked, but even worse, threatened to collapse, should be carried out urgently. Another burning issue was the facade of the body, from which fragments of rotten bricks fell off time and again.

The roof of St. Mary's Basilica was meticulously reconstructed. Interestingly, it was removed from its structure during the works... 600 tons of concrete, which was used during the post-war reconstruction. photo: [Trojmiasto.pl](https://Trojmiasto.pl)

The renovation lasted nearly 4 years

However, the new parish priest set himself the goal not only to remedy both problems, but also to bring about a major overhaul of the entire church. Although it seemed unbelievable, this bold plan has been put into practice. In March 2017, the implementation of a project worth nearly 20 million zlotys was started, ""Revitalization and protection of the cultural heritage of the St. Mary's Basilica complex in Gda≈Ñsk"". On the last day of December last year the project was officially completed.

The scale of metamorphosis is impressive. It is enough to mention that it was the biggest renovation of this Gothic monument since the time of reconstruction from the war damages at the turn of the 40's and 50's. All the works were carried out under close supervision of specialists. It is not only about the Pomeranian Voivodeship Monument Conservator, but also about the scientific and conservation council operating at the basilica.

Unfortunately, an unfortunate accident occurred during the renovation. On October 29, 2017, a 30-year-old man fell from the scaffolding placed around the temple, who was employed at work on the facade. The doctor called to the place of the incident stated his death.

&amp;#x200B;

What was part of the renovation?

The following tasks were included in the scope of the just completed project:

&amp;#x200B;

Revitalization of the elevation, including reconstruction of a freight bay window on the eastern wall, and revitalization of 36 huge stained-glass windows.

Complete renovation of the roof with the replacement of the structure, including the reconstruction of the last, missing signature - a small tower - which was located above the main nave until the spring of 1945.

conservation work on the main altar

adaptation of the former boiler room to a multimedia room

reconstruction of the presbytery

construction of installation channels in the floor and laying new electrical and teletechnical installation in them

preparation of educational films

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, other initiatives, not formally part of the project and financed by the city and the parish, were also carried out during the renovation. We are talking about the restoration of the organ prospectus and the astronomical clock. Another success was to recover from the German capital and restore the original equipment - the 15th century Holy Trinity Altar.

Support for renovation from many sources

In an interview with us, the pastor repeatedly stressed that such a comprehensive renovation would not have been possible without the support of many institutions and private donors. The budget of the project, which amounted to about 19.7 million PLN, was financed from several sources.

About 16.6 million zlotys came from the EU funds, operated by the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, about 2.2 million zlotys from the City of Gdansk and about 0.9 million zlotys from the parish's own funds, which were collected mainly thanks to the donations of parishioners, residents of Gdansk and thousands of people from all over the world who visited the Basilica. Some of them bought special bricks in the form of wooden stars, which were hung on the vault of the church.

\- I would like to thank everyone who took part in the realization of this biggest renovation in history after the reconstruction from the destruction of World War II. Thanks to the cooperation of many institutions and people of good will, which cannot be mentioned here, the renovation, which restored the Crown of the City of Gdansk to its original beauty, was successfully completed. But most importantly, I am very happy that we can now safely walk around the basilica and nothing falls on our heads. Once again, thank you all very much - comments Fr. Bradtke.

In the middle of the picture, above the main nave, a reconstructed bell is visible. In accordance with centuries-old tradition, a small bell, weighing only 60 kg, was placed in it. It is named after Saint John Paul II, who visited St. Mary's Basilica in 1987. 

Floor renovation is still waiting to be completed

The scope of the project also included the renovation of the floor composed mainly of tombstones, but this element had to be excluded from the work schedule. Reason? In March 2020. The Pomeranian Regional Monument Conservator ordered to stop the works. It was surprising because it happened when the floor was almost ready. The degree of progress of works was about 95%.

\- We were accused that the contractor was cutting gravestones on the floor, which was not true. The only thing that was being cut were the unshaped tiles \[fillings between tombstones - ed.\], which were also part of the floor. The permission for this was issued by Agnieszka Kowalska, the former provincial conservator. Later on, we were accused of removing bones buried under the floor, which was also not true. On this basis, the current conservator Igor Strzok issued a decision suspending all works on the floor and presented us with new conditions of renovation, which in our opinion were impossible to meet. We tried to talk, look for a solution, but unfortunately it did not work out - explains Fr. Bradtke.

According to the Code of Administrative Procedure, the parish filed an appeal against the conservator's decision with the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. The case is pending. Due to the exclusion of the renovation of the floor from the project, the cost of the work done so far - about 2 million zlotys - had to be covered by the parish's own resources. The circumstances of this case are described in detail in the publication ""Patricians sleep peacefully"", which can be read on the website of St. Mary's Basilica.

In the floor of St. Mary's Basilica there are several hundred tombstones. Most of the records come from 17th and 18th century. The oldest one dates back to 1411 and was made as a marking of the burial place of mayor Konrad Leczkow, sneakily murdered by the Teutonic Knights.

But you can't ask us to give up on parts of our country, just look at Spain (Catalonia), or Britain (Fawklands just to name one), or any EU country that had troublesome territory - they are willing to delete it off the face of the Earth rather than letting it go. And then you have Crimea, which is exactly the same as Kosovo but in a manner unfavorable to EU. So... This is just to point out the hypocrisy. 

For instance, EU is tottaly fine with current Serbian dictatorship as long as it obides with efforts to accept that we ""legitimately"" lost 1/3 of our teritorry, and slowly turn the public opinion towards it. Why I say EU is fine with that? Because aside from mild statements, they are doing nothing to enforce true democracy, or even the freedom of press in Serbia (all are government backed/controlled), as it would be unfavorable to EU's agenda. So, thus the hypocrisy. I mean, of course it's more complex than that, but let's be honest, EU still plays the role of ""yeah yeah, you'll get in eventually"" just to keep itself seated on Pri≈°tina-Belgrade negotiations.

I don‚Äôt care one iota about Scotland or it‚Äôs independence. I‚Äôve started to seriously find the hypocrisy and ‚Äúradiant aura of Scottish holiness‚Äù to be irritating however. 

This mistaken belief forcefully spammed everywhere by ScotsNats that Scotland is a bastion of all that‚Äôs good in the world and is being held back by an evil England.

The truth is Scotland was part of every single bad thing the U.K. ever did, it is almost as Eurosceptic as the rUK and it is being kept on life support by the English, economically at least. Not to mention it‚Äôs major part in the Northern Ireland troubles (which as an Irish citizen is important to me).

2476,"&gt;Thanks for digging out ancient history great leap forward and cultural revolution 

Thanks for pointing out, that China was one of the most ancient civilizations and thanks to the cultural revolution even something that happened 70 years ago is now considered ancient.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;great leap forward and cultural revolution, already being discredit in China 

This brings a good point. How are touchy subjects being handled and though in todays China. Would you please elaborate. How is the great leap forward, the cultural revolution, the one child policy, the Tiananmen Square massacre being thought in school? What are your thoughts as a Chinese person?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Chinese system is what enable China to rise from what it was to what it is today, can your country do the same? 

In the past 20 centuries China has been the leading nation in 19th of them. Do you want to guess in which one the CCP ruled over China?

&amp;#x200B;

As I said it in my last post, the CCP and the communism with Chinese characteristics failed miserably. If you don't trust me, let me give you an example. This example is... China. But the one that you don't talk about. The China that is not build near a free economic zone, and does not benefit from foreign investment. The China that still lives in accordance to the Communism with Chinese characteristics. This China that is still being held back by that. This is the China where the majority of the Chinese people live and according to the Chinese premier Li Keqiang 600 million Chinese (43% of the total population) lives on under 140 USD per month.

&amp;#x200B;

So to your question, can my country surpass having 43% of the population to earn 140 USD. Yeah, we did it decades ago. Time to catch up.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Covid infested land can't even walk outside of your house after dark because crime murder rape rate is sky high. 

Is this what the propaganda in China is currently saying about the west world?

[Link to Wiki:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_China) The 2013 *Multi-country Study on Men and Domestic Violence* asked men in China if they had ever coerced a female partner into having sex (including [alcohol facilitated rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_facilitated_sexual_assault)). 22.2% said yes. 9.3% had done so in the past year. 19.4% raped their partner. 55% of the men who had raped had done so more than once and 9% had have so on four or more partners. 86% cited sexual entitlement as their motive (the highest percentage in the study) and 57% answered that they raped out of boredom. 72.4% experienced no legal consequences. 1.7% had raped another man. 25.1% who had raped reported first doing so as a teenager. 2.2% admitted to having committed gang rape.

...

 Victims of rape in China often remain silent and do not report the crime because traditional culture holds that being raped is shameful and should be kept private.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_China#cite_note-10) Popular activist [Guo Jianmei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guo_Jianmei) told the story of a villager who raped over 100 women, and asserted that ""not one of them spoke up."" In another incident, a girl and her mother tried to register a complaint against a rapist, but Zhong Xiancong, a police official, did not register it and suggested to the victim, ""To protect your reputation, you should forget about the whole thing.""[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_China#cite_note-lafran-11) 

...

Damn boiii! I wanted to talk about how China paraded just 2 weeks ago that it had defeated the virus and that now it started to impose lockdowns again. But after that rape statistics... yeah. Holly shit, how do you even live there?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;China leads on Crisper geno tech

But it was BioNTec, which used CRISPR in their vaccines. Sinotecs' vaccine uses dead virus in it. If China was the leader in this technology, shouldn't it have been the other way around?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;but maybe you just need to travel and read more.

I would love to be able to travel again. I will leave it to your imagination as to why I can't currently.

2567,"After 2500 years from the Hittite entry, **around AD 1071 when recent Oghuz Turks came**, not only all Anatolians had Hittite ancestors, but almost all Anatolians had all of the original Hittites who migrated in Anatolia as ancestors. The moment any Oghuz Turk married a native Anatolian, Armenian, Caucasian, Greek speaking Roman, anyone, it is an automatic Hittite ancestry for the children born.

Is it possible that any modern Turk has no Anatolians in ancestry and only a product of Oghuz Turks? Practically a flat no. Forty generations of avoiding any genes from Anatolians and finding a pure zero-Anatolian Oghuz Turks is impossible. Even the remotest Turcoman mountain tribes could not have avoided that. Given the Central Asian tradition of snatching brides from as far and strange away as possible, I don‚Äôt think there can be even one single such soul.

Therefore if in forty generations every Turk has now some if not dominant Anatolian genetic background and if every Anatolian when they arrived had Hittite genes prominantly in their genetic backgrounds, every Turk today has Hittite ancestry genes. And in abundance.

In fact it is not only every single Anatolian Turk has ‚Äòsome Hittite ancestry‚Äô but **every single Anatolian Turk has among ancestors every single healthy member of the original Hittites arriving in Central Anatolia** before they adopted the name of the Hattis they replaced. Every single one of those settlers, probabilistically, is among my ancestors. They just may not cover a significant proportion of the genes but that is another matter, the quantity.

2580,"Depends, id generously say its very unlikely that grandstanding (a term I use here as a fellow independence hopeful) like this will cause any portion of the stated billions to be produced.

However, id also doubt that's the intention here.

Brexit is pretty unpopular in scotland, and it seems to be the case that a political axis has formed around anti-brexit/pro-independence attitudes.  Id include myself in that.  There is an election to the local/devolved scottish parliament comming up, and the SNP are running with a manifesto commitment to deliver a second independence refferendum (second as we had one in 2014, before the brexit refferendum of 2016).

So my guess is that Blackford's intention is to be able to say that Westminster is refusing to produce any portion of the stated billions, which is useful to increase the SNP vote in the scottish parliament, which in turn is intended to strengthen the mandate for this second refferendum.

2600,"""People leaving placebo arm sabotage trials"" is complete BS.

1. There are not enough ""leavers"" to really affect anything. Compared to 7000 placebo group people, few 10s of ""leavers"" mean nothing.

2. The data before general vaccination started is obviously unaffected by that and is reliable. And that's more than 3 months of data.

3. ""Placebo volunteers getting real vaccine "" can only REDUCE the measured efficiency (by not getting ill as a result if vaccine works, or not changing anything if it doesn't). It can't increase as a result of them. So if e.g. vaccine gets 90% efficiency with ""placebo damage"", its true efficiency can only be higher.

Finally, there was NO restriction on people to get tests or even get the actual vaccine in the clinical trial document (and that would be totally unethetical), so nothing illegal/wrong happened.

2640,"Canadian here, so we get are fair share of snow like you guys do. Trees, since they‚Äôve been saplings, experience snowfall on their branches. The weight of the snow and wind during harsher weather over time causes the cells of the trees to be more dense and withstand more weight as they get bigger. This is why it‚Äôs rare in our parts of the world to witness trees falling or snapping due to the weight of snow. In our regions, it‚Äôs more common to see branches snap off or trees fall during ice storms, as ice storms are less frequent and the accumulation of ice weighs more than snow. An example of the cell density was discovered after growing tall trees (could‚Äôve been palms) in a greenhouse in England; they kept falling over after a certain height and replanting new ones, unsure as to what was the cause. They eventually discovered that in nature, wind creates a type of scarring on trees that strengthens them as they grow taller, but still allows them to be malleable enough to create less resistance by swaying in the wind and all this prevents them from breaking/snapping/falling over.",,/r/europe/comments/ktuarz/madrid_paralyzed_after_historic_storm_with/giqr79p/,jovejove,1610262636

2669,"&gt;you can't vote for a specific ""party"" (or wing, how they call it over there)

You can, in the primary. It's not uncommon to find cases of some populist/activist defeating an establishment incumbent during a primary and then winning in the general. The primaries (usually around Feb-March of the election year) probably have the most ideological diversity because there's just so many candidates running. Our general elections for Congress (November of election year) are like the ""run-off"" phase.

We have primaries for each parties candidate for every seat (some Senate/House seat primaries literally have like a dozen people running for the same party's nomination) about 8-9 months before the general election. AOC (left-wing activist Dem) won her seat by defeating Crowley (centrist establishment Dem) in a primary in a safe D district.

Any sort of ideology you'd expect from a ""third-party"" candidate probably exists somewhere in either of the 2 main parties during the primaries, it's just up to the individual candidate and their supporters in the district they're trying to win for them to actually take the seat.",,/r/europe/comments/ktnx0k/who_becomes_chancellor_after_merkel_credit_lucas/giqbrez/,Typical_Athlete,1610252000

\-Greens have allready won in the one issue department, every party has adopted their ideas on the environment. They are currently mainly a party for people who get paid by the state and very young voters as they sell themselfs on topics of ensuring something is left for people in the future.

\-The CDU/CSU are a center-right party, they were founded on the idea that right of the CDU there is only the wall. So there is no cooperation with anyone right of the CDU, as their self image is allready to be the most right party that is legal under the constitution. 

The AFD is now it's third version. It's a pure protest Party. In it's first version it was a economic popularist party. It's 2nd Version was a split party and the current version is a Replacement  Party for several Ultra right wing parties that suffered from beeing investigated by the constitutional police. They consider themselfs as the true right and to steal voters from CDU and ""the Left""(die Linke)....It's weird to explain.

FDP is a civilrights party , but they are either very academic and free of Charisma or corporate and a bit lofty headed.

\-The SPD (red)  is the oldest Party of Germany still allive. The Split of many members and voters towards ""Die Linke"" (the Left) , damaged that party pretty hard. They are shrinking into popularity values below the greens. And they think it's caused by their cooperation with the Archenemy the CDU. So they will not continue forming a coalition. Yet the Greens want to get into power and move something... they also dislike the CDU and have cultivated this image of the Archenemy, yet as of lately more and more bourgoise voters vote the greens...so if the don't want to loose them...they have to get in power.

\-Non integrated Muslims 100%  will not support the AFD...this is pretty much the ""into the oven"" party. Ex-muslims might support them to some extent.

Integrated muslims might vote 

CDU (there is a muslim wing in the CDU...it's weird as it's a party with ""christian"" in the name) 

SPD (they promote laizistic views and tollerance and success through eduction)

GREENS (they hate religions except for Islam, they think less religion and more conservative Islam is  good thing for Germany,  this is especially funny for many turkish women in the greens on city level who mostly disagree with their party in that matter...)

FDB (The party has no opinion on religion...muslims might be members of that party, but that party doesn't promote or demote religion of anykind)

&gt;Haag Tribunal declared that it wasn't a war crime

Tuƒëman died vefore Haag, if he didn't he would probably follow the path of Milo≈°eviƒá, experts agree on that. Back to the things that did happen, Haag sentenced leader of that operation Gotovina to sentence of multiple daceds of inprisonment, and he was guilty on around 10 points of crarge. After the appeal he was suddenly released (went from multiple decades to not guilty) and points of charge went from around 10 to 0. One can only assume someone made a call in the meantime and protected their golden boy since it's unreal to be charged and sentwnced for 10 different things, and then suddenly released month later. Just remember that Haradinaj walked free from there because all the witneses were killed, Americans and Germans protect their investments.

&gt;America, Germany and almost the rest of the world made a weapons embargo at the beggining of the war. Only when they saw we aren't giving up they started sending trainers in hope we would win which would finally end the conflict.

This is very naive to assume, no. 1 global superpower + no. 1 European power don't make decisions just like that, there always must be a plan, they don't roll the dice and pray that outcone is in their favor, they make things happen. All of that was a sharade and politics, they called Milo≈°eviƒá a factor of stability until they saw he won't play ball, they were always on your side and there is even a CIA document made public recently showing how Western powers played a large role in destruction of Yugoslavia.

&gt;Who gave Slavonia to us? How can anybody give something to anyone which was always theirs? West Slavonia was occupied so when it returned to Croatia it was liberated becaus liberation means getting rid of occupation. It wasn't given, it was negotiated to return without more blood.

Milo≈°eviƒá gave it to you, to end the war there and focus on Kosovo, that's also why he allowed the ethnic cleabsing and mass exodus to happen so he could populate Kosovo with those people, it was all in a deal made with Tuƒëman, along with all that Vukovar sharade. JNA could have taken it since it had massive advantage in manpower and arms (tanks, artillery, etc.) but he played games with his vuddy Tuƒëman who he shared a foreign bank accound and made deals under the table. If we had honest and propper leadership Croatia would never wil that war, if you look at all military statistics from the start of the war it's clear.



&gt;Why do Serbs have a lot of minority rights today if our goal always was to be ethnically clean? If our goal truly was that, then Serbs surely wouldn't have their members of parliament guaranteed (and we sure as hell wouldn't have a croatian Serb as one of government vice-presidents), we would do everything to make them leave.

EU. And you basically already accomplished your plan from WW2 to make 1/3 of Serbs dead, 1/3 exiled and 1/3 converted. The amount of Serbs now left is insignificant compared to before and is no threat to you. So you keep them to save your immage and so you could say exactly this. But ecen now Serbs are largely discriminated and there are often ethnic-hate-fueled attacs on them, there are even many Serb villages left without electricity in tge 21st century.

&gt;Your thesis that modern Croatia is based on genocide doesn't make sense, you are just repeating Vucic's rhetoric, a rhetoric that is precisely made so that you think less about today and the sad state of your country, and think more about evil Croats and ethnic cleansings.

I don't care about Vuƒçiƒá and I'm not a fan of him, I'm just telling it how it is, there were 581.663 Serbs in Croatia in 1991. and in 2011. there were 186.633. If that's not ethnic cleansing I don't know what is.

Only around 40 years before the 90' you commited genocide of Serbs with such vrutality and sadism that even Germab officers were disgusted, and suddenly a few decades later you turned into saints and we are the genocidal people, even with those numbers from paragraph avove?

And if he fails the people, can they gather at Tiananmen Square and ask him to take responsibility by resigning? How do you think it will end?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;that why the party is able to lift people from past state to current state

Well, that is untrue. The CCP tried to modernize the country on its own. Those programs were the great leap forward and the cultural revolution. How did they end? With millions of Chinese people dead. And while the Chinese people and their children were starving to death, the CCP was exporting food to the USSR. Why? Because the CCP doesn't value the average Chinese life, and the Party leader is not accountable to the average person.

&amp;#x200B;

The change started once China under Deng Xiaoping started to open its border for foreign companies to come and invest. Even the most recent success - Nio, is thanks to western companies. The chief designer is German, most of the software and hardware was developed in Germany and the production is done by JAC Motors, which is half owned by Volkswagen.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Chinese people donot need to swaer to the party unless he or she is a party member. 

And yet in the daily life you need to become party member for so many things. If you are a chairman of a company with 50+ workers, either you become a party member or a party member will be send to you.

And lets not forget that as a party member you need to go to ""party book clubs"". I mean, who doesn't love to read Xi Jinping taught?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; No democracy is worse than or better than, it's just plain bad. 

Well, I was born in a Communist country myself, and then I saw it collapse. So I know that there are many differences between them, some are good, some are not so good. But as a citizen of a democratic country I know that I have rights and no one, even the government, can trample them. Let alone make me disappear like a horse cloud.

Given that we've established that both Ukraine and Russia invade countries, one would think that an actual human rights group could be less one sided. 

For instance, Russia had so-called Moscow Helsinki Group that was mostly focused on the violations made by the federal troops (or how Western and Jihadist propagandists called them, Russian troops) in Chechnya. I have the lowest possible opinion of Moscow Helsinki Group, specifically, because of their ties with the CIA, but isn't that what human rights NGOs normally do, expose the wrongdoings of their own country?

There are internal fights between the moderate and the extrem far right, every other day because one of them crossed another red line. Which is rightfully easy in germany when it comes to far right ideas.

And they are already under observation by our domestic intelligence service.

Yeah they are gaining votes but they are stuck in the opposition because a coalition with them would  be political suicid for the other parties and they alone won't make enough votes to gain any real power.

So bottom line. I am not very worried about them and I am fairly certain they will fall apart at some point because of internal fights.

What I only know is that Haag Tribunal declared that it wasn't a war crime and they must have had that recording as opposition evidence. Evidently it wasn't enough. And thanks for complementing the operation it really was remarkable, and is studied in millitary universities today.

America, Germany and almost the rest of the world made a weapons embargo at the beggining of the war. Only when they saw we aren't giving up they started sending trainers in hope we would win which would finally end the conflict.

Who gave Slavonia to us? How can anybody give something to anyone which was always theirs? West Slavonia was occupied so when it returned to Croatia it was liberated becaus liberation means getting rid of occupation. It wasn't given, it was negotiated to return without more blood.

Why do Serbs have a lot of minority rights today if our goal always was to be ethnically clean? If our goal truly was that, then Serbs surely wouldn't have their members of parliament guaranteed (and we sure as hell wouldn't have a croatian Serb as one of government vice-presidents), we would do everything to make them leave.

The police implied the investigation (again, really?) would lead to ¬£200 fines for the perpetrators. I think a lawyer has pulled them up explaining that's not yet legal so they've back-pedalled a bit since and said the comment that the investigation would ""likely lead to a ¬£200 fine"" was badly worded and of course it wouldn't result in a fine.

Unfortunately, if you change that and have the government instruct them to be as draconian af, then there's a worry they'll go full medieval and abuse that power. I honestly don't think most policeman know the law inside out (wouldn't expect them to in all honesty), so when they're trying to be strict you get the possibility that things aren't offences (the police just interpret behaviour as being disobedient), but they inadvertently escalate the situation until an offence is committed and tensions are increased.",,/r/europe/comments/ktparf/snowball_war_in_callao_square_madrid_long_time/ginz2xy/,KristaG43v3r,1610208822

3464,"The EU has hit back at criticism from member states that its bloc-wide vaccine procurement plan has failed to secure enough doses to enable a rapid start to inoculations.

In a letter to German parliamentarians seen by the Financial Times, J√∂rg Wojahn, the EU‚Äôs representative in Berlin, described accusations that the European Commission had been overly cautious in reaching agreements with vaccine manufactures last year as ‚Äúmeaningless‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe Member States themselves decide on the purchase of the vaccines; they are also the ones who pay for them,‚Äù Mr Wojahn said in the letter. ‚ÄúIt is not the EU that pays for the vaccines.‚Äù

The EU official‚Äôs intervention came as a blame game escalated over the slow pace of the vaccine rollout in many European countries. While Britain has vaccinated more than 1m people, as of Tuesday, Germany, Spain and France had vaccinated 367,00, 139,000 and 5,000 people respectively.

Mr Wojahn rejected criticism that the EU did not order enough doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, which last month became the first to receive regulatory approval by the bloc, trailing the UK‚Äôs green light. The European Commission said this week that it was in talks to secure more doses. 

Mr Wojahn said the negotiations that resulted of an order of up to 300m doses from BioNTech in November ‚Äútook place at a time when it was not even remotely certain that the vaccine would have the necessary efficacy and would be the first product to be approved in 2020.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf this had been objectively evident at such an early stage, the entire world would have invested in BioNTech and production capacities for this one vaccine and the company would not be facing delivery problems today,‚Äù he added.",,/r/europe/comments/ktoheh/eu_hits_back_as_blame_game_over_vaccine/gindaxy/,SouthernBrush3022,1610193823
3465,"But following encouraging preliminary results from early trials on July 1, the UK and the US signed supply deals with BioNTech and Pfizer within 20 days. In early June, the European Investment Bank agreed to provide a ‚Ç¨100m loan to BioNTech, but the EU only finalised a supply deal with the company on November 11.

The EU, with a population of almost 450m, has assembled a portfolio totalling more than 2bn doses of seven different vaccines. But investments by the EU to help companies cover upfront costs appear to have been relatively modest compared with those agreed by the US.

Mr Wojahn said the EU had pre-financed production capacity with roughly ‚Ç¨2bn in the summer and early autumn. In contrast, Donald Trump‚Äôs administration in the US began funding vaccine producers through its Operation Warp Speed programme back in March. It has spent more than $12bn to date ‚Äî more than a third of which was given to Boston-based biotech Moderna alone ‚Äî although the total also includes some drug pre-order payments.

Defenders of the EU approach point to the challenges of setting up an entirely new vaccine procurement programme and co-ordinating with member states that have varying demands. Some national governments, such as France, have also faced criticism domestically for being too slow to distribute vaccines already delivered under the EU programme.

But German politicians, including Bavarian premier Markus S√∂der, who also leads one of Germany‚Äôs governing parties, the Christian Social Union, have said the blame sits with the EU.

‚ÄúThere was probably too much bureaucracy at the European Commission‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâtoo few of the right vaccines were ordered and price debates went on for too long‚Äù, Mr S√∂der told German newspaper Bild am Sonntag.

‚ÄúIt is difficult to explain that a very good vaccine was developed in Germany, but others are vaccinated with it more quickly‚Äù.",,/r/europe/comments/ktoheh/eu_hits_back_as_blame_game_over_vaccine/gindbmk/,SouthernBrush3022,1610193840

All cultures and their traditions change tremendously over time, and it would be madness to insist that what we do today is exactly what they did centuries ago.

Christmas in my family is rooted 100% in tradition and 0% in any belief in anything supernatural related to Christianity. It may have been a religious holiday at some point (and surely still is to many folks out there), but for us, that Jesus fella is absolutely irrelevant.

Now, defining *the religious* is obviously not an easy task. Religiosity is definitely more diverse than most people are aware.

3509,"&gt; I‚Äôm legitimately scared they‚Äôre trying to start something

I don't think it's something to worry about. Scottish UDI simply wouldn't work because the Scottish government only collects about ¬£3 billion in taxes a year, the other ¬£30+ billion a year they spend is either collected on their behalf by the UK government or comes as part of the block grant from the UK government.

The UK government would simply stop payments into the Scottish Consolidated Fund as soon as UDI was declared, and the Scottish government would be unable to pay its own workers (doctors and nurses, police officers, civil servants, teachers etc). 

How does the Scottish government get the police, civil service and judiciary to ignore the law and carry out their instructions when they can't even pay them?

I think modern communications and IT have centralised control so much that UDI is impossible in a functioning first world country.

I get that the linke is often viewed as the socialist party(not communist), but I think socialism &gt; naziism.
Tho its a very controvesial topic that needs to be discussed. 

And if red-red-green was to happen, you have to realize that the linke party would be the smallest group in the coalition.
So if they really push the extremes its likely that the green and the SPD can still prevent the linke from taking actions.

The worst coalition is the CDU + AFD + FDP coalition.

The CDU is corrupt and wings its way through, the AFD is radical-right and wants to make germany a nazi-country again, and the FDP are supporting anything that gives them money.

So the CDU can make deals with corporations, while the AFD makes national politics, and as long as the FDP can make a bit of money off of that they wont object too much.

Imo thats far more dangerous than a slightly left-oriented government.
And I say ""slightly"" because the green party would be the strongest force in the coalition and the linke would probably put people like bodo ramelow or riexinger in charge of their lead.

3522,"Well to qualify this a bit, figuring out how it works immediately provides a brute force way to crack it in the sense of solving for the key - and on top of that the Polish team found ways to reduce the time from that. But the issue was to be able to crack the key *fast*, within hours if possible, so that enough messages could be read to be worth it before the key changed. That was what the early work of Bletchley Park consisted of, and hadn‚Äôt been ‚Äòsolved‚Äô already, which was why they brought Turing and the others in in the first place. 

The addition of a fourth rotor (critically, one-sidedly) drastically increased the difficulty and was the next big achievement on the Enigma front, but that happened two years into the war. 

Of course it wasn‚Äôt just Enigma, the German naval cypher: the other big achievement at Bletchley Park was cracking the German army‚Äôs Lorenz cypher, which was even more computationally intensive.

Yeah, I know.  [Just commented on that in another thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/ktf39i/covid19_uks_daily_death_figures_are_grim_but/gimm6d5/), that all the levers that the government had planned to be pullable, it's pulled already.

&gt; You guys need to get vaccinating.

I mean, it's not a lack of deployment -- what's being produced is being used.  Just only so much vaccine production.  Aside from Israel and Bahrain, I think that we may have purchased the most early production out there, and IIRC from an early chart on the sub, our outstanding orders run until the middle of the year.    It's presumably gonna be all over us before those deliveries finish.

&gt;at best have a month

I dunno.  You guys had three to four months before Patient 0 went to the current state.  We don't know when B117 was introduced to the US -- hell, the mutation in question could even have occurred in the US -- just that it's there and spreading now.  Could be a month.  Probably don't have the six that we'd want, though.

US news is just starting to talk about it now, as best I can see, and it's not starting to talk about estimations of practical implications, just that ""it's gonna cause a spike in infections"".  I figure in a few more days, they're gonna start having people start putting more-concrete impact estimates in the news.

I commented about the respirators, because it's one thing I could think of that we *didn't* have in place when all this kicked off -- supplies just got wiped out then, but they aren't now.  And elderly people definitely aren't all wearing them, so that's one lever that hasn't been pulled that would target aerosol transmission.

If you look at Sweden's deaths by age, you'll see that 27% are 90+, another 42% are 80-89 year olds, so basically 70% of deaths are 80+ years old.

Another 20% are 70-79 years old, so 90% of deaths are in 70+ year olds.

3893,"&gt;The European Union, for the first time, will become a direct shareholder in startups through the creation of one of Europe‚Äôs biggest investment funds.

&gt;The European Innovation Council Fund, expected to total about 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion), is an effort to plug what the EU said Wednesday is a ‚Äúcritical‚Äù funding gap for breakthrough technologies to scale up to commercial levels and better compete with the U.S. and Asia.

&gt;It will combine grants and equity stakes to finance early-stage companies in so-called deep tech, such as health, sustainability and advanced manufacturing. Ownership will range between 10% and 25% of a company, with ticket sizes as much as 15 million euros, the EU said.

&gt;Traditional venture capital firms have smaller funds in Europe compared to the U.S., leading investors to take fewer risks, EU officials said. VCs also have a defined investment horizon, typically having to issue returns to investors within ten years.

&gt;By directly financing scientific breakthroughs until they become viable for traditional investors, EU officials say the funding will derisk the investments and thereby attract other investors.

&gt;The EU currently puts money into tech companies through grants from the commission and via the European Investment Fund, which invests in venture capital firms. While the EU won‚Äôt divert funds away from venture capital firms under its new budget, the move allows it to bypass those investors, along with their fees, to boost early-stage firms.

And as for the the Nazi comparison, they *didn't hide* what they were doing to the Jews, they were *proud* of it.  If China's hiding something on that scale, they would have to have supernatural powers.

Unfortunatelly you won't find any real S≈Çowi≈Ñc√´ there (Kashubians that lived in that area were called that) since after IIWW they were all deported to Germany.


You can also ride a train from Gdynia to Hel and see the Hel peninsula you can stop at any town at the peninsula although I would ride to Jastarnia or Hel, Jastarnia is less touristy but more authentic Kashubian, but Hel is very good too! While you're at Hel I would suggest checking out [Checz](https://www.google.pl/maps/place/Checz/@54.6032996,18.804068,96m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x46fd042ba562b807:0x288d6f7af9df9cb8!8m2!3d54.6032242!4d18.8040655), [Kutter](https://www.google.pl/maps/place/Kutter/@54.6033956,18.8039727,18.25z/data=!4m11!1m5!2m4!1sRestauracje!5m1!4e9!6e5!3m4!1s0x46fd042b613ba46d:0xaf9157dd3fd0377e!8m2!3d54.6034658!4d18.8035485) or [To-tu](https://www.google.pl/maps/place/Bar+rybny+To-Tu/@54.6033308,18.804035,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x46fd042a374d4c5b:0x356d6e9e801c9d4d!8m2!3d54.604346!4d18.8034761). And there is a reservoir for Seals here where scientist do science with them (idk what they do). There are also WW2 fortifications there.


I would suggest avoiding W≈Çadys≈Çawowo but there is a nice walking path by the beach all the way to Jastrzƒôbia G√≥ra, you can also go to Dolina Ch≈Çapowska while you're there. There are some good places to see there but it's really boring most of the time. In Rozewie you can check out the cliffs and the lighthouse. In Jastrzƒôbia you can check out the northernmost point of Poland, more cliffs (even taller cliffs this time) and Whiskey House if you're into that kind of thing


You can visit Palace of John III Sobieski in Rzucewo and stables there in Rzucewo there is also an oper air museum that is about old seal hunters, AND you can see for yourself how people of Rzucewo culture lived there 5000 years ago it's a place full of history, also there you can buy some Kashubian k√πcha from an old lady. (she doesn't speak English) you can go on a bike path to Puck from there and in Puck you can visit medieval Church, Pretty city square, Marina, Fishermans harbor, Museum of local Kashubians in XVII century old hospital and you can also see drowned ruins of old harbor build in VI century although idk if they still do diving there.

In Puck you can also check out how artisans make glass and how it was made in ancient times in our region. DISCLAIMER!!! If you can't find somebody to show you the old harbor don't go there yourself you might drown trying to get there!!!


There is also a castle of Von Krokow family in Krokowa, but it's worse than the one in Rzucewo tbh, but they have batter palace gardens tho.


There is abandoned ruins of old unfinished atomic power plant in Kartoszyno to which you can easily sneak in, and on the other side of the lake you can find another open-air museum in Nadole focused on Kashubians and how they lived in XIXth century countryside.


As for the beaches I think Lubiatowo is the best (nice beach and not a lot of people)but there might be troubles getting internet there, you can also find sand dunes there like those in Slowi≈Ñski National park but smaller, there is also a legend that there is a water source in the forest that makes the drinker of it more attractive and irresistible to men/women. There is also a old ass barrow in the area. Best beaches with internet are nearby in Bia≈Çog√≥ra, but again the beach might be a bit crowded. A bit farther east of Lubiatowo you can find Osetnik and another lighthouse there and some more even smaller sand dunes.


In ≈Åeba (which is place you need to go if you wanna see S≈Çowi≈Ñski) you can find some cheesy mainstream touristy shit but it's not so bad if you have kids because there are a lot of stuff for them to see like Evolution park, Sea park, Power Park, Rope Park, Labirynth park and some other parks too, as for more serious stuff there is a place where nazis tested rockets there, runic stones and ruins of old church and old evangelical cemetary and early XX century castle, but it's a hotel now and idk if you can actually visit it.


In Gda≈Ñsk I would see the old city, Oliwa and the zoo in Oliwa, WW2 museum, European Solidarity Center, Westerplatte, Amber Museum, Uphagen house, the basilica, Artus Court, and shitton of other museums and places of culture, the ones i listed are from top of my head so there might be more interesting places that i didn't write about but im not from Gda≈Ñsk and im not really there that often. 


That's all of the interesting stuff I could think off in Northern Kashubia, but if I was you I would go to the rest of Kashubia too, because the expierience is really incomplete especially without amazing landscape in Southern Kashubia. There are 3 more national parks there! More than in any other place in the country!

One of the two big teaching unions said staff should refuse to go in to work as it wasn't safe, and so more schools around the country had to close because they didn't have enough teachers. On Monday evening the government decided that all schools would close for at least six weeks starting from Tuesday, after they had already been open for one day. Everyone was angry that they waited for a day to decide and let children go to school on Monday, spreading the infection further, instead of keeping the schools closed after the holiday.

Approximately 250,000 Polish prisoners of war were captured by the USSR during and after the invasion of Poland.[16] As the Soviet Union had not signed international conventions on rules of war, the Polish prisoners were denied legal status.

Among the some 14,471 victims were top Polish Army officers, including political leaders, government officials, and intellectuals. Some 4,254 dead bodies were uncovered in mass graves in Katyn Forest by the Nazis in 1943, who invited an international group of neutral representatives and doctors to examine the corpses and confirm the Soviet guilt.[15] 22,000 Polish military personnel and civilians were killed in the Katyn massacre,[2][19] but thousands of others were victims of NKVD massacres of prisoners in mid-1941, before the German advance across the Soviet occupation zone.""",,/r/europe/comments/ktbgqt/today_is_100th_birthday_of_aleksander_tarnawski/gilpufo/,CorrectHippo,1610152080

4305,"Lol I like the way you think!

This whole issue with ""sexualizing"" people being so negative comes from poor sexual education in my opinion.

There is nothing wrong with talking about how you like the way someone looks. We're animals, we eat, drink, breathe and have sex. Those are essential but somehow sex has become this weird taboo thing. I'm in my early 30s and I remember our education was basically ""don't do it"" lol.

We should be taught that being attracted to people is normal and it should also be normalized to just ask people if they want to hook up/have sex. It would clear up a lot of social issues.

With all that said, I bet this guy is thrilled that so many people think he has a great body. It's just that if this was an attractive woman in a tank top, people should be free to say she has a nice body without the social justice warriors jumping all over them calling them all sorts of names (which doesn't happen when it's a guy).

You're upvoted because you're saying I bet a bunch of guys are saying these things, which I'm guessing is upvoted by a bunch of women (who didn't upvote, or downvoted the post pointing out the double standard) who don't want to admit that there are blatant double standards when it comes to a lot of their complaints about society.

So I guess the legality and ethics of the German move can only be judged late this year, when vaccinations in Europe conclude.

&gt;Chief Constable Iain Livingston has said that at present he is¬†""satisfied about the legitimacy and proportionality"" of the response.  
&gt;  
&gt;Gatherings in homes are banned to ease pressure on the NHS as the number of coronavirus cases continue to rise.  
&gt;  
&gt;Footage shared online showed a police officer standing inside the hallway of the home as a woman was held back by another man.  
&gt;  
&gt;The woman can be heard saying: ""It is my house, get out of my house. I did not ask you in here.""  
&gt;  
&gt;An officer can be heard to say: ""We could have forced the door if you didn't open it.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The woman asked for what offence, and the officer referenced a ""suspicion"" over the number of people there. The woman added: ""I am the woman of this land."" And then then told the police officer ""get your f\*\*\*ing body out of my f\*\*\*ing house.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The officer warned that she could be arrested for a breach of the peace.  
&gt;  
&gt;A voice can then be heard off camera saying: ""Just stop it mum"".  
&gt;  
&gt;A man then walks in front of the woman and stands between her and the police officer.  
&gt;  
&gt;The woman can be heard pleading with the officer to get off another female, claiming that she has epilepsy.  
&gt;  
&gt;One voice can be heard to say: ""Calm down, or you will be in cuffs, i'm warning you.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Under new coronavirus legislation police officers are legally allowed to enter homes if ""that person reasonably suspects that an offence under regulation 5(1) is taking place on the premises"".  
&gt;  
&gt;A member of the family who posted the video said it showed that there was ""no-one in my house that shouldn't be"".  
&gt;  
&gt;She added: ""Also, my family and I have done absolutely nothing wrong but stand up for ourselves. It's absolutely awful and I am so disappointed in Police Scotland at what they have done to me.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Two women, aged 18 and 48, and a 43-year-old man were charged in connection with assaulting police officers and threatening and abusive behaviour, according to Police Scotland.  
&gt;  
&gt;A spokesman said: ""We received a complaint from a member of the public regarding a breach of coronavirus regulations at a property in Aberdeen, around 11.20pm on Wednesday, 6 January, 2021.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Officers attended and two women (aged 18 and 48) and a 43-year-old man were charged in connection with assaulting police officers and threatening and abusive behaviour and will be reported to the Procurator Fiscal.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Chief Constable Iain Livingston said that¬†some of the officers involved actually had body-worn cameras with them, and they had been activated, adding that ""there will be a broader record of the full circumstances of that incident, and that will be part of the due process"".  
&gt;  
&gt;At the Covid daily briefing he¬†said:¬†‚ÄúI have been briefed on the full circumstances. As things stand at this time, I‚Äôm satisfied about the legitimacy and proportionality of the police response.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúNow, the matter is sub judice, but what I can say is that on Wednesday, 6th of January, around 2330 hours, police did respond to certain calls from members of the public about what appeared to be an ongoing house party.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúOfficers then attended at the house that had been identified and at that time spoke to the occupants.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúNow what‚Äôs come out of those circumstances is that three adults have been charged with crimes of violence and crimes of public disorder.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúI can‚Äôt comment further because of that matter, the matter will be reported to the procurator fiscal. The process will take its course.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúHowever what I can say is that I would urge everybody to exercise caution when you see a partial coverage of a particular incident. Do not read into things that you can‚Äôt see, and do not make inferences that are not clearly there. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to anybody involved. ""  
&gt;  
&gt;The incident comes two weeks after the First Minister said that in announcing new Covid-19 curbs including a cross border travel ban and that Police Scotland and [**transport**](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/transport/) operators were being asked to consider ""how the enforcement of this can be strengthened in the period ahead.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Police Scotland figures show they issued more than 300 fines for Covid breaches during the new year period, latest figures show.  
&gt;  
&gt;A total of 326 fixed penalties were handed out between 28 December and 3 January, while a further 21 people were arrested over the same period.  
&gt;  
&gt;Indoor gatherings were prohibited and outside socialising limited under the rules in place across much of the country at the time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Police Scotland have said formal enforcement would only be used as a last resort. This is similar to its approach during the first lockdown in March.  
&gt;  
&gt;The force has said it ""would not hesitate"" to take enforcement action on the small number of people not sticking to the rules.  
&gt;  
&gt;Covid fines start at ¬£30, doubling to ¬£60 if they are not paid within 28 days. Repeat offenders can face fines of up to ¬£960.  
&gt;  
&gt;The number of people fined over new year was down slightly on the previous week (341 people were issued with fixed penalty notices between 16 and 27 December, while 18 were arrested).  
&gt;  
&gt;The majority of Scots were said to have heeded warnings to hold Hogmanay celebrations at home with household members.  
&gt;  
&gt;But official figures show that - in addition to the arrests and fines - 858 people were asked to disperse by officers on 31 December and 1 January, including seven who were dispersed using ""reasonable force"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Another police enforcement action came against a group who gathered at a rented property in Aberfoyle during the festive period.  
&gt;  
&gt;Police Scotland confirmed that 32 people were charged with culpable and reckless conduct in relation to this incident on on 27 December.  
&gt;  
&gt;Householders may only enter another home for essential work, to join their extended household or to provide care and support for a vulnerable person.  
&gt;  
&gt;Police have also been given powers to break up groups of more than 15 people meeting inside homes.

4487,"I agree with everything you say, other then:

&gt; Unless countries like Germany accept the cost and risk of nuclear

Only nuclear + renewable doesn't work realistically. They actually work against each others goals. Renewables give you cheap energy supply that is quite easy to scale up (as long as there is political will for it, looking at UK and China for example). Their problems lies in their unreliability. When there's no wind and the sun doesn't shine you need huge energy buffers and power plants that you can fire up in short time. The safety power plants should also not cost too much when they idle, since when the situation is good for them, renewables will produce a lot of power for cheap and without much co2.

Nuclear power plants provide a huge amount of energy with amazing stability. Only really dry winters/summers can become a problem, but that should be neglectable for the bigger scaled ones. But they are really expensive, can't be shut down fast, nor can you just power them up in seconds. They also have exceptional high idle costs as they start to consume power in that case (for cooling and other safety concerns, but also because they are so expensive to build). This means you want to run them at least at 80% (or utopic 100%) nearly all of the time. This means they are not the best to handle power peeks, and they are actually terrible to just stop in case you have an oversupply (because of renewables for example).

Both these technologies work against each other, or rather they are good to full fill the baseline power. And both kinda want an energy supply that is easy to start stop with lowish idle costs. And that's where gas comes into play. A gas plant isn't as expensive as a nuclear power plant. Gas can be fired up immediately and (other then the building costs of the plant) it's idle costs are not a problem. Best thing though is that you can use the same gas infrastructure to burn hydrogen (with a middle step of converting it) so Gas plants could be even used in the future when you don'T have to burn natural gas anymore.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/kszzj8/bad_news_for_russia_as_gas_from_azerbaijan_now/gijwl37/,Are_y0u,1610122210

Ever since we've been gravitating in that direction. Central European states are the ones with whom we spent time for most of our history.

You've provided some fine examples to claim we're central and I sincierely hope we'll solidify our position there. But here I must ask you: Do you honestly feel, when thinking about our people and the way our country works, we belong in same group as Austrians, Slovenes, Czechs? 

How can you say that when you observe our decayed cultural scene, when you look at our toxic and cumbersome business climate, when yet another round of investments and eu fonds has gone down the drain and into pockets of individuals with connections or party membership, when you look at our corrupt and incompetent leadership living like parasites on people's backs, reigning them in with populist and nationalist rhetoric? 

I get what you're saying, though. I don't refer by Encyclopaedia Brittanica because brits are the last people to objectively describe other nations. I don't claim against you because I hate our nation or have ill feelings towards it either, but because I don't believe we're up to central european ""standards"", so to speak.

4537,"The Beatles impact was due to the cultural influence already in place, they were not the ones that created the cultural influence, it already existed and knowingly or not, it was the vehicle that brought them to international audiances. They did shape music going forward because of this... but who is to say that, had French been the global language and France the influencer and main exporter of entertainment, that French artists rather than English would now have the most impact on what forms music takes.

These things shift, there used to be a time when the main influences in the musical scene were from Italy, Germany, Austria, Russia and France. 

Maybe after another century they'll talk about how China revolutianized music the world over, and the likes of Queen, Beatles, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, Elvis, Metalica, Elton John will only be a sidenote in the mainstream like Chopin, Back, Schubert, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninof, Stravinsky, Verdi, Prokofiev, Paganini, Strauss, Berlioz, Scarlatti, Monteverdi, Mendelssohn, Prokofiev Are now, which were all ""rock stars"" of their time. 

I don't see here a clear dividing line in who and where revolutionized music in a sense, a great many artists influnced eachother in small ways , and when you then compare music from 1950 to music feom 1970, it's very different indeed, but the change was not instant, neither with the Beatles nor anyone else, the, do stand out because they were very popular, but most certainly there was much influence from others. The song ""A day in the life"" also utilizes quite a bit of classical music.

Take the song ""Those were the days"" produced by Paul McCartney and performed by Mary Hopkin in 1968, which competed with the beatles song ""Hey Jude"" at the time, the song itself is from 1925, and the ""modern"" variation of the music is not much different from its original (Lyrics are changed however).. with that one, there is a clear path of development, as an example-

From [Original lyrics and music - Dorogoi dinnoyu](https://youtu.be/BVrmd0M_WRA)

A fella by the name of Raskin, who grew up with the music, wrote [This version ](https://youtu.be/2O5EeBjxhiY)

He played in a club where McCarthy frequented and liked the song, finnaly recording [This version ](https://youtu.be/y3KEhWTnWvE) with Hopkins.

Of course they are. The new Armenian government was a bit cold to Russia, and they got a taste of how would they fare without Russia. 

Armenia has no alternative, good relations with Russia are a must to secure their very existence. 

&gt;when they support their enemies and act like their alliance isn't worth anything.

That's not true though, their alliance does not cover a war in Azerbaijan. 

&gt;No way.

What do you mean no way? Armenia has no other ally.

&gt;Russia proved its alliance was useless for keeping Karabakh 

It never was supposed to.

&gt;and that they are opposed to Armenia making progress in battling corruption. 

Russia couldn't care less about corruption in Armenia. They are opposed to Armenia making moves towards Russian opponents.

That kind of talk is exactly what I meant. You may claim you are a democrat as much ad you want but this is no democratic thought whatsoever. 

&gt;it's often seen as more important to gain favour with an indispensable head of state, rather than a temporary head of government.

The person is temporary the position is not. Thats why governments most of the time uphold the previous governments agreements and treaties.

4734,"&gt; He apparently didn't use any violence so how the hell did he manage to do it?

No, not as far as I know. He supposedly used his weight to hold one of the women down, but I wouldn't necessarily call that violence.

&gt; She agreed to it if he managed to do it without violence.

Depends on which of the two women you mean. The one who was asleep when he penetrated her without a condom clearly couldn't have given consent at the time. She had, as far as the records go, insisted on him using one the night before, but maybe they had some agreement.

&gt; And there is no way on earth that you can do this by stealth, you feel it if the condom is there or not, let's not play dumb here.

I don't know what they could and couldn't feel, but let's assume you're right. Then why does the term and concept even exist, because I sure didn't invent ""stealthing""?

&gt; Two girls paid probably millions to lie about something like this... That's what the story is about.

It's not impossible, but there is literally no evidence for any of that, and not for a lack of trying. The Internet even tried to make it out that one of the women was a CIA operative because she had worked with the Ladies in White in Cuba. Also, supposedly (also according to the Internet) the police and/or prosecutor forced it on the women, which would mean that they are innocent.

&gt;And even if it was the case, let's admit that he did that. Ok fine.

For the same of argument, sure, but he was never convicted of anything.

&gt; Why in hell would this be worthy of extradition to the USA where the guy will be brutaly executed by their ""justice"" system?

It wouldn't. It would have nothing to do with the US business. It wasn't my argument that he was, and I don't think it was matttk's either. You said he was ""innocent"", which can be read as a general statement.

&gt; Do you think that not using a condom is worthy of this?

No, I obviously don't, but I also don't think it's because of it that he is in the situation he is. The molestation/rape business could've been  over with ten years ago, long before there was any extradition request from the US.

&gt; AND what has happened to the persons exposed by the leaks? Nothing.... That is the concerning point in my opinion, not some petty crime like using a condom or not...

4875,"[Cost of living Lille](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Lille) hopefully this gives you some sort of general idea on prices.

&amp;nbsp;

Lille is quite a beautiful city the 4th largest in France according to my understanding. It used to be a Flemish city called RIJSEL and is still referred to as such when travelling with the NMBS/SCNF from Belgium to France, remember that one.

&amp;nbsp;

Most people in France can generally only speak French especially the older generation and people in more rural areas, younger people and people living in urban areas have a higher chance of speaking a second language and that chance is even higher in big cities and more so in the capital city of Paris. Cities situated on border regions like Lille have a higher likely hood of people speaking the languages of the bordering country due to their proximity to each other and it's in this case most likely Dutch being the second language. Since English is such a international language you'll certainly meet people who can speak it in Lille especially a the train station, the bank, even the university. So just know some general French phrases to go about your buy your bread is good enough. Don't go about investing your time and energy so heavily in a language only used in place where you are not going to live it's not worth it, rather focus on your studies. 

&amp;nbsp;

Yeah there are clubs and what not, also Smoking is national sport in France so I don't think you'll have much of a problem.

&amp;nbsp;

Drinker you say well then your a fortunate guy in the world with access to the best beer from the region and Belgium. You should certainly try some Belgian beer if you haven't, especially West Vleteren abt 12, St Bernadus abt 12, Chimay Blauw, Rochefort 10 Westmalle double and Triple are all really good.

&amp;nbsp;

French people are generally more social than the northerly neighbours of Germany and Belgium in comparison. People in rural areas tend to be way more friendly than in urban areas for some reason. When going in to a small shop any where in the region ALWAYS Bonjour the cashier or shop owner it's very basic social manners acknowledgeing other peoples existence when in their presence. Please and thank you and a smile also goes a long way.

&amp;nbsp;

4888,"With the recently announced 2020 Enlargement Package and an Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans, the region is on the top of the EU agenda. Promised the perspective of membership, the countries from the region move towards joining the block at an uneasy pace. What is the future ahead of the Western Balkans? What obstacles can the integration process encounter? Who and what actions can support it?

The European Union‚Äôs experience with the Western Balkans is an ambiguous one. On the one hand, the European Union plays a crucial role in the reconstruction, support and reconciliation of these countries, promotes regionalism and local ownership of cross-border initiatives, provides for security and promotes western values. On the other hand, the sluggish enlargement paths with unexpected stops and detours, an endless brain-drain, flirting with local autocrats and a growing gap between the Union and the candidate-states trigger frustration and exasperation.

While this love-hate relationship endures, other players leave their footprint on the region. The limits of the European Union‚Äôs soft power are cyclically tested by Russia. China, Turkey and Saudi are making inroads while the United States‚Äô approach to the Western Balkans is reduced to piecemeal efforts and inconsistencies. These external factors reach the ground of a region locked between nostalgia for the past and uncertainty for the future. At a time when demographic trends are discouraging and the  European Green Deal as well as the quest for innovation clash with the daily challenges of the ordinary people, there is a need to map the key triggers that in various combinations can steer the region in different directions.",,/r/europe/comments/ksy85i/western_balkans_2030_trends/giitjfh/,JackRogers3,1610093634

5146,"&gt;I‚Äôm in China, and we‚Äôll aware of its faults. 

Please don't get caught. I would love to speak with you more.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The side losing out economically ... instead of facing facts ...  everything in China is fake news.  At least the Chinese are smart enough not to believe their own bullshit 

I do hope that this makes you aware of your own bias. On the one hand side you are accusing us of being smug about Chinese statistics. Yet when it comes to the relationship between the Chinese people and Chinese news, not trusting them makes you not smug but smart.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the reason why neither the Chinese nor the Europeans (or Americans) don't buy the data that the CCP is providing, is in both cases the same. Lack of trust. You have Xi, who last week announced that the corona virus was beat in China and a week later cities in Hubei get another round of lockdowns. And somehow 200+ people got infected with a virus, that apparently does not exist anymore. To some extend 2021 starts the same way that 2020 did. Xi saying that there is nothing to see there. And while in 2020 EU politicians were much more trusting, it seems that nowadays no one is getting fooled. Even Ted Ross found balls to complain about China standing in the way of the WHO accessing if the virus originated from Wuhan or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I‚Äôm in China, and we‚Äôll aware of its faults. 

Of course you are. The Chinese are smart people, and as we have the saying - you don't eat the tomatoes with the sticks holding the fruit. However knowing your own shortages is not enough. You should be capable of talking about them and finding a solution that works for the society. This is where I believe is the biggest weakness of top down approaches, such as the one in China. If the government does not identify the problem as worth solving, it will just be shrugged under the rug. And I am a firm believer that problems are like a snowball. If you take them in the beginning in your hand, your hand will feel cold but eventually the snow will melt and you will be on your way. If you just push the snowball further down the road, it will just get bigger and bigger until you can't move it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;At least the Chinese are smart enough not to believe their own bullshit, more than can be said for the Europeans. 

Europeans don't share one opinion. They have a wide variety of opinions both based on their own experience and based on how they gather the information, which is needed in building said opinion. This is where there is a great difference between western democracies and China. In China there are multiple news outlets, yet they all sing the same song. Here, different news outlets have different political standpoints and show different opinions. I do hope that you will have the possibility to come and visit Europe for a prolonged time, live in different countries in it and build your own opinion of it.

&amp;#x200B;

When I visited China in 2011 the people there were enjoying an ever better getting life, they were very friendly towards foreigners not only as a selling point, but because they genuinely had a positive disposition. I now that now, thanks to the governments propaganda this disposition has soured. I do hope that in the feature it will be reverted, as I would love to visit China again, especially as a country, where the normal person would have the right for self governance, expression of his/her own opinion without fear of prosecution and free out of the chains that a totalitarian regime has put on them.",,/r/europe/comments/kr70y6/in_romania_the_covid_vaccine_was_delivered_to_the/giiiya7/,MagesticPlight1,1610085085

What I did was make sure I did not do the classic 2 kids with 2 years difference in between. My oldest was a lot of work to keep entertained as a toddler, no way we could have added another one to the mix, even an easy baby.

The truth is that you never know what you're gonna get, there's no rules.

Putin obviously gets a lot of criticism in Europe, but it is admirable to him that he made Russia so great on the world stage. I actually have a few questions for you:

1. Now that Biden is America's new president, do you think that more sanctions will be imposed on Russia? Trump was not really anti-Russia, so I expect the Americans to be a lot harder towards Russia. 
2. Which EU countries do you think Russia has the best relationship with?

It was not uncommon for people who couldn't duel each other to do so and pretend they got hurt on unrelated accidents or if there was a casualty, that it was due to illness.

The judicial system was also pretty lax in the enforcements of those laws because of the conception that people who duelled did so in order to enforce a code of honor and did it more or less well, to the great dismay of the pragmatists who only saw the loss of life.

5303,"The second scenario would be more effectively make room for change, thats givin even though I don't know whether that would actually have much room for peaceful developments. 

For the synopsis of russian history, I know and the ""kiever rus"" as we call it, was actually starting more or less in Ukraine. I studied history and took some time for east European history, but a few hundred years is quite a long shot even for global politics if it were to change back by that time frame. 

""Making it anti russian"" I think thats were the big axioms are hidden. I think we both assume that NATO is in fact at least partially anti-russian already. The difference is  that we fear what they might do if we progress in that and you fear what they might do, if not.

 You might say they have proven quite profound what they might do, recently. Whereas we would say, that this was caused out of russian fear of western influence approaching (maidan etc.), which is illegitimate, no question. 
Connected to that is the axiom, that Germany assumes that russia is going to seek a state of balance and is not willing to do much more, which makes Belarus quite interesting. Whereas east europeans might say they will never gonna stop. 
Thing is, most germans find that stance irrational, we think they have some kind of neighborhood in mind which they want to control but thats it. I'm pretty sure russia would interfere with Belarus changing to much and definitely wants to stop ukraine from getting too much influence to be a serious obstacle to their felt need of control.
The shitty part arrives here. Germany is not willing to risk any escalation, which includes some eastern Europeans countries to be left at russias mercy, to some extend. The political and morally anger russia ignites with that, is merely a measurement for russia for how far they have ventured into serious territory. 

Personally I would take Frances public stance on how far we allow russia to go before the sanctions grow harder and harder and there is lobbyism in Germany to soften that down, but I fear we still lack a serious tool to  take another step beyond economic sanction and before all out war. I hesitate to speak for ultimate economic pressure because our quiver is all but empty than and I'm not sure, that we would achieve what we intend by that.

5307,"The European sanctions are actually far lighter than many people realise. The EU sanctions ban an import on goods from Crimea and restrict trade/investment related to projects around Crimea &amp; Sevastopol. Beyond that, you'll be surprised that there is not a lot of sanctions on mainland Russia itself, the only one is military (Russia couldn't care as it mostly builds 99% of it's arms at home). European countries all get around this by simply sending all their goods to mainland Russia. With a bridge connecting Crimea to mainland Russia now, the supply chain isn't really that affected, simply rerouted, albiet one could argue through a quicker route with a bridge now than before Russia annexed Crimea.

A majority of the restrictions actually come from Russia itself. We are the ones restricting the import of many goods from Europe and decide to be picky on which ones we want to let in and from which countries. We have been pushing an on significant import substitution drive as a catalyst to charge the local economy to produce most of our needs at home. In a few years after the sanctions, Russia propelled to being the l[argest wheat exporter in the world](https://www.rbth.com/business/332948-russia-leading-wheat-exporter#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20Russia%20will%20retain,tons%2C%20to%2083%20million%20tons.), we produced so much that we just started exporting and topped the league. Local farmers were flooding to the banks to get loands to scale their production capacity for chicken, lamb, pork, beef, fishing etc.. because for the first time, they were not competiting with a Europe that has learned to scale and local demand was on the rise. The European sanctions have helped us realise a lot of local initiatives. Russia for example wasn't even producing turbines for wind power generation and when we sent one to Crimea (a Siemens gas turbine), [we got sanctioned](https://www.powerengineeringint.com/coal-fired/equipment-coal-fired/eu-imposes-sanctions-following-siemens-turbine-incident/).  Again, this European action led us to create a local industry to create this highly technical product which only a few countries currently produced. And the result, Russia's local turbine industry was born with the creation of [our first higly complex gas turbine](https://www.dieselgasturbine.com/7011924.article) for power generation. It is only a matter of time before this company scales production and we'll be selling these to 3rd nations. The EU's sanctions has created a paradox where it has actually helped create endless new industries in Russia. One could argue that before the sanctions, we were too lazy and it was just convenient to order from an established manufacturer in Europe and have it delivered pre-packaged. Now, we are forced to go back to what we did best in the Soviet times, innovate and leverage our smart talent pool.When this sanctions regime ends, I suspect out of it's ashes will spawn a phoenix of change in Russia that is self sufficient and technologically capable.",,/r/europe/comments/ksmjqn/the_danes_have_received_the_nord_stream_2/gihiwse/,thekremlinbot,1610065243

Nordstream 2 does erase this possible scenario and even if russia decides again to block ukraine from gas, you know what, there's still a pipeline from germany going eastwards to ukraine, from which they could also benefit then indirectly.

Yes somehow it's bad for ukraine as they will loose some fees for transit of the gas but there are other ways to compensate for that.

I might also point out that the eastern pipeline also crosses belarus, which at this point with the current dictator seems not like a reliable partner to me.

Ukraine is not going to be in NATO or EU any time whatsoever, thats harsh thats fucked up, but thats are the cards you were dealt. Europe whatsoever has an interest in securing its neighborhood. If biden takes more interest we might see more action against Russia. In the long term I doubt that the US will have a growing interest in you or east Europe for that matter. So this european army is still your best bett within or out of it. 

You are deliberately taking this ""depending"" as political brutal force, which we can not apply. It is still true though that the growing market for natural gas (which is assumed, i grant you that, not certain) will be met. This russian gas will be bought, there is need, there is the price, it will be bought. If we have an option to opt out of russian gas because there are still other suppliers we have an option against russia. This is not great dependence but it will hurt as economic sanctions hurt them eight now. Germany has chosen the way of economic influence on Russia because for most of us it seems to be the best way, until they directly endanger the EU.

5456,"#**How long, Berlin, will you abuse our patience?**

**In defending Nord Stream 2, Germany is resorting to ever bolder and bolder measures, issuing a disastrous opinion to the most powerful state of the European Union, which should serve as a model of responsibility, the rule of law and solidarity.**

""How long, Catiline, will you abuse our patience? When is there to be an end of that unbridled audacity of yours, swaggering about as it does now? Don't you understand that your plans have already been revealed?"" - these words of Marcus Tullius Cicero, spoken in the Roman Senate after the discovery of a conspiracy against the republic, can be easily applied to Germany's actions aimed at protecting the controversial project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.

**At all costs**

The true meaning of constructing this pipeline, running from Russia to Germany, was concealed from the very beginning by both Moscow and Berlin. The official narrative about the project stated that Nord Stream 2 is a purely business project, implemented by private entities. Even these simple statements, made, among others by Chancellor Angela Merkel, contain a huge load of disinformation. The company responsible for the construction of the gas pipeline is Nord Stream 2 AG - an entity belonging to Gazprom, i.e. a Russian state-owned enterprise.

On the other hand, the fact that the currently existing onshore transmission infrastructure is used up to a maximum of 70% proves the non-economic sense of the construction of the Baltic gas pipelines. Why then invest huge resources in new pipes, which in addition have to be laid on the seabed, when the existing infrastructure still offers the possibility of increasing transmission?

Arguments against the purely business nature of Nord Stream 2 were also pointed out by Sberbank's analysts, who published a report on the profitability of building this connection in May 2018. Accurate calculations have shown that even assuming that Nord Stream 2 will be 60% full (which will be difficult due to problems in the construction of gas pipelines distributing gas across the continent), the investment may only pay off after 20 years. Disclosing this data came at a cost. The author of the report, Alex Fak, lost his job at Sberbank. His supervisor, the head of the analytical department of the bank, Alexander Kudrin, who inadvertently allowed the document to be published, shared the analyst's fate. The president of Sberbank CIB, Igor Bulancew, described Fak's behavior as ""unprofessional and unethical"".

Despite this, the highest German authorities still adhered to the narrative about the business nature of the project.

**Come Hell or High Water**

But what is the real purpose of Nord Stream 2? To see it, just look at the map. The construction of a huge transmission line on the bottom of the Baltic Sea (the gas pipeline is to have a capacity of 55 billion cubic meters per year) allows it to bypass traditional transit countries (above all: Ukraine, with which Russia is actually at war). It is this aspect that is the most important result of the construction of Nord Stream 2. The gas pipeline obviously has its economic implications (it allows Germany to build a central gas hub), but its political dimension significantly exceeds their level.

At this point, it should be emphasized that Germany made a deal with the Russians on Nord Stream 2 despite the war in eastern Ukraine caused by Russia, the Anschluss of Crimea, the downing of the MH17 plane, an attempt to poison Skripal, the incident near the Kerch Strait or the attempted murder of Navalny.

All these situations clearly show that Russia is an aggressive state, ready to commit political murders and conceal its responsibility, lying to international public opinion with vivid eyes. This does not prevent Germany from cooperating with the Russian regime in building a colossal project with geopolitical consequences for the whole of Central Europe.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/ksod8q/how_long_berlin_will_you_abuse_our_patience_pl/gih4chf/,pretwicz,1610058118

5458,"&gt; I consider myself a far left liberal   

which more or left translates to ""reactionary right"" in European politics.

The crucial difference is that in Europe, generally speaking, people expect the State being the one making sure infrastructures and rules are set and respected, and taking care of people who cannot do it by themselves. One of the core-principle of ""european"" mentality is ""Bad Shit Can(and Will) happen to me and people I care even if we have no fault. Let's make sure  to build a safety net for everybody who might need it and let's hope I don't need it.""

American mentality, even ""left"" mentality is more ""If somebody is in the shit it's because they weren't ~~good enough~~^(for any value of *good*, be it economical, moral or whatever). Why should I pay for them? I'm *good* unlike them, it will not happen to me!""

A lot of the Gulen's guys I knew were big chunk of Gulen's religious donations. They have a tax exemption scheme, where they launder business profits from the disciples' businesses as religious donation to Gulen's religious organization.

5898,"Regardless of how offensive it is, you can't deny that the UK has done a lot of questionable stuff around the world during colonial times and also in the modern history. Just like all other powerful countries did and continue to do, nobody is purely value-driven, sometimes countries break their values in the name of protecting the same said values. Germany is probably one of the countries where values influence the political discourse the most given its history, yet you still see the German government being very flexible in values when it comes to important economic manners. 

There is not much that can stop Germany when it comes to making business deals, I mean, their economy is very export-driven, their prosperity stands on international trade and China is an actor that can hardly be ignored when it comes to international trade. You may not like it, but that's how it is and that how it consistently has been with Germany, i.e. see the whole NS2 saga - no matter what Russia does, Germans are hell bent in finishing the pipeline.

For France, this is not bad either, they always wanted for the EU to be more distanced from the US positions, which the UK helped them achieve by leaving the EU. Most smaller EU countries are just not big enough to have any specific agenda on China, it's not a priority for them, so they will let Germany set the agenda, perhaps only Poland could potentionally care, because it cares a lot about its ties to the US, but even for Poland this is not a priority, they have more important things to argue with Germans about. Perhaps the European Parliament which is more detached from national interests could put a brake on the deal, but to be honest, when France and Germany want something in the EU and the other member countries don't really strongly oppose them, it's eventually going to happen one way or another.

5912,"No no no, see, it wasnt an annexation, let me explain it to you dense people a bit better.

The reason for this uprising was the decision of the Great National Assembly of the Serbian people in Montenegro, better known as the Podgorica Assembly, according to which the Kingdom of Montenegro unconditionally unites with the Kingdom of Serbia, which would immediately form a joint state of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. After the elections for the Podgorica Assembly, the ""Whites"", who advocated unconditional unification, outnumbered the Greens, who were supporters of preserving Montenegrin statehood and conditional (confederal) unification.

To clarify some of the things, the uprising was done by the ""Greens"", The Greens were members of political movement that wanted unity of Kingdom of Montenegro with Kingdom of Serbia as confederate state, they were allegedly ok with all types of unity but the one that happened in 1918. that was voted for by Podgorica Assembly, it wasnt pressed by the Kingdom of Serbia or anything. Montenegro was and still is a Serbian land they were and still are one of the purest and bravest Serbs (back then Serbian tribes) to exist. People of Montenegro in 1918. wanted union with motherland (Serbia) and they voted for it, some people didnt like that and this uprising happened. Opposed to the Greens were ""Whites"", they were for unconditional unity with Kingdom of Serbia. Both Greens and Whites had military and political leaders that did their job as their ideology demanded. Whites extenguished the uprising and Montenegro was united with Serbia. The guerilla attacks continued up to 1929 after the uprising was extenguished. Montenegro stayed in unity with Serbia up to 2006. when referendum for independance of Montenegro was called and passed.

TLDR: Serbia didn't annex Montenegro, Montenegrins voted for unity with Serbia, some other Montenegrins didn't like that and fired some guns and got bi*chslaped so hard they still cry even today.",,/r/europe/comments/ksaxw3/on_this_day_1919_christmas_rebellion_took_place/gif1of9/,Voja-Tankosic,1610021388
