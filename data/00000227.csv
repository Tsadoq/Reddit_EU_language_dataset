&gt;Americans may ""have"" bigger companies, but the benefits go to a selected few, while the costs decrease total wealth and is paid by the many. 

WTF does this even mean? I think EU tech companies underpaying workers so the owners keep more of the profits is not good for Europeans at all. 

This quote from the actual article points this out well:

&gt;Index Ventures started in Europe more than 20 years ago, and invests in a portfolio that’s split between companies on both sides of the Atlantic. The venture capital firm argues that one of Silicon Valley’s “key ingredients” is employee ownership through stock option grants, which help tiny startups attract top-tier talent.

&gt;It creates a virtuous cycle—the success of “Google millionaires” helps pull more bright minds into the ecosystem. Besides motivating young coders to work hard, it also encourages them to stick around the company long enough to reap the rewards. Index published a book to help founders in Europe navigate the complexities of stock-option regimes in a region made up of 30 different countries.

&gt;Criteo, an advertising platform founded in Paris, discovered this difference when it expanded in the US and began hiring: “It’s just not part of our culture,” said Jean-Baptiste Rudelle, CEO of Criteo, one of the executives quoted in Index’s book. “Interview candidates in Paris asked us about meal tickets, not about share options.”

&gt;The company agreed with the principle of sharing the reward, however, and adopted the practice. At least 50 employees became millionaires when it floated on Nasdaq in 2013.

And keep in mind that the US - unlike the EU, for some reason - is hard core about collecting taxes. Apple paid $16B in taxes on $59B in profit; it's the largest taxpayer in the US. Even with recent tax changes, US corporate tax rates are still higher than corporate tax rates in most of Europe.

118,"&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if Silicon Valley goes the way of Detroit.

It's *possible*. But German and Japanese automakers had a long history and dominated their respective domestic markets. They got their break when large US automakers misjudged and then mishandled the need for smaller and more fuel efficient cars after the oil shocks.

IBM is similar to the big 3 US automakers, and lost its domination about the same time due to the massive transition from mainframes to PCs. But they were replaced by MS (mostly) and a large number of more or less generic computers. 

MS missed out on the smartphone revolution to Apple and Google and manufacturers like Samsung (although MS is still dominant in computers).

And eventually those market leaders will be replaced by someone else as markets change. But it's not *random*; the new leaders are going to have to be doing something dramatically *better*.

Just wishing that SV would become Detroit won't make anything happen, and European tech companies won't be in any better position if the new SV is in Seoul. 

(It's kind of a dumb comparison anyway; Detroit was where factories for three large centralized companies were located; SV is home to thousands of tech companies).

This finding also suggests that there are alternative, less intrusive, and more effective ways of preventing HIV than circumcision, such as consistent use of condoms, safe-sex programs, easy access to antiretroviral drugs, and clean needle programs.**”](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896)

LOL that you think condoms are not effective.

[“A comparison of male circumcision to condom use concluded that supplying free condoms is 95 times more cost effective.” Not only more cost effective, of course but also more effective—period—in slowing the spread of HIV. Condoms are cheap, easy to distribute, do not require the surgical removal of healthy genital tissue, and—yes—are much more effective at preventing infections. Compare. Condoms: 80% minimum reduction in HIV infection, for both males and females [3]. Circumcision: 60% relative risk reduction (and 1.3% absolute reduction), of female-to-male transmission only, according to the most optimistic presentation of data from three contested studies.“](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2012/05/when-bad-science-kills-or-how-to-spread-aids/)

Your specific wording was ""Condoms we're (sic) around when all these studies"" and honestly trying to fix your sentence it only made sense with 'weren't'.

LOL I was going to let that sentence go until you attack me again. Lol *you* are having trouble spelling and making sense and then blame others lol. And then you create revisionist history saying it was 'were' instead of 'we're' (sic)!

LOL you're good on the comedy on this one. 'Please google and do my homework for me.' Classic. If you want to make an argument then you make *and substantiate* it. 'Please judge, just google my case for me'.

LOL now you're rewriting history! And again without giving a source! **Current rate** is 58% **""Among hospital circumcision rates""**. As in done in hospitals and afaik excluding private clinics and religiously performed ones that will increase that rate. And that's *neonatal rate*, not the whole adult population which is what's so relevant to your STI argument. Can I laugh even louder now?!? Now I know why you don't give sources, because you don't want anyone to point out your mistakes! Oh my cheeks hurt. Just imagine the fun things I could find if you actually gave sources for your other long quotes.

[""During World War I, the military led a concerted effort to circumcise soldiers and sailors""](http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=8&amp;id=73) which continued on to WW2 and sons of those soldiers. 

[""During the 1950s the rate of routine infant circumcision exploded from about 50 per cent to about 90 per cent. ...around 1960 ... nearly every American boy got circumcised.""](http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=8&amp;id=73)

Sure I won't forget that ""HSV NNT = 16"", another poor stat. That HPV has a highly effective vaccine. *That prevention of trichamonas through circumcision doesn't exist in the literature!* That all STI's can be protected against by safe sex and condoms, which is both much more effective and less invasive. That [""Phimosis, balanitis and candidiasis are intertwined and ...determining the NNTC to prevent them individually is not possible.""](http://www.canjurol.com/html/free-articles/V24I1_19_FREE_Letter_Editor_Feb17.pdf) That ""cervical cancer NNT = 90 – 140"", another terrible stat. And that [""HPV vaccination for girls will dramatically decrease the incidence rate of cervical cancer.""](https://www.cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision)! Wow that was a lot, you don't forget it either!

Good, I dug these up for you.

[“The VMMC Experience Project sent cameras into Uganda and Kenya to document the realities of the mass circumcision program ... and found:
1. Africans are told circumcision conveys immunity from HIV.
2. Condom use is at an all-time low, and AIDS is on the rise.
3. The program is killing the very people it is supposed to help.
4. No follow-up post circumcision (cut-and-release approach).
5. Resentment and outrage among Africans.“](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/africans-speak-out-against-the-mass-circumcision-campaign-300370353.html)

[“Others argue that the program results in a dangerous false security. The present investigation confirms that men, women, and teens are abandoning condoms out of a belief that they are already protected by circumcision. This in turn increases the spread of HIV.”](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/africans-speak-out-against-the-mass-circumcision-campaign-300370353.html)

[“""I blame those who told me that if I get circumcised I won't get HIV,"" said one respondent, ""and I got HIV already!"" Others mourned the loss of friends, brothers, relatives, and neighbors to AIDS following the procedure they believed would protect them. ""These people are dying of HIV due to ignorance,"" a respondent explained.”](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/africans-speak-out-against-the-mass-circumcision-campaign-300370353.html)

[“Instead of mass circumcision, Africans want funding for sustainable medical facilities, anti-retroviral medications (ARVs), more durable condoms, HIV education, and poverty reduction initiatives. Many cite AIDS-related tragedies from the VMMC program. They seek an end to the circumcision campaign as a public health disaster.”](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/africans-speak-out-against-the-mass-circumcision-campaign-300370353.html)

And on to condom vs circumcision: 

[“A comparison of male circumcision to condom use concluded that supplying free condoms is 95 times more cost effective.” Not only more cost effective, of course but also more effective—period—in slowing the spread of HIV. Condoms are cheap, easy to distribute, do not require the surgical removal of healthy genital tissue, and—yes—are much more effective at preventing infections. Compare. Condoms: 80% minimum reduction in HIV infection, for both males and females. Circumcision: 60% relative risk reduction (and 1.3% absolute reduction), of female-to-male transmission only, according to the most optimistic presentation of data from three contested studies.“](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2012/05/when-bad-science-kills-or-how-to-spread-aids/)

[“Of course, one could reasonably argue that men with a high risk HIV infection could use both strategies to boost their protection–wearing condoms and getting circumcised–but the threat of behavioral disinhibition makes this argument a bit more tricky than it appears at first. the actual implementation of these recommendations may very well lead to more HIV infections, not less. ... The big idea here is “risk compensation”...  Risk compensation occurs when people believe they have been provided additional protection (wearing safety belts) [such that] they will engage in higher risk behavior (driving faster). As a consequence of the increase in higher risk behavior, the number of targeted events (traffic fatalities) either remains unchanged or [actually] increases. They argue: Risk compensation will accompany the circumcision solution in Africa. Circumcision has been promoted as a natural condom, and African men have reported having undergone circumcision in order not to have to continually use condoms. Such a message has been adopted by public health researchers. A recent South African study assessing determinants of demand for circumcision listed “It means that men don’t have [to] use a condom” as a circumcision advantage in the materials they presented to the men they surveyed. [Yet] if circumcision results in lower condom use, the number of HIV infections will increase.“](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2012/05/when-bad-science-kills-or-how-to-spread-aids/)

Yes thin air, please quote where *I said* anything regarding natural. It's thin air because you had to conjure something up and stick it in someone's mouth lol. It's hilarious you're still trying to defend it and just shows how desperate you are to create and latch onto whatever you can (see below). I just re-read it, it's an impressively long rant about something that was never even said, and that you even admit you made up. Perhaps next response we'll discuss the term *normal* more if you ask nice, there's enough above for you to read and *respond* to. But to finish, *your ignorance* displays your ignorance towards the issue.

Lol nice that you can pick out half a sentence that you like, literally ignore the second half of the sentence, ignore valid critiques, and then ignore absolutely everything else from around the world. What you thought was a zinger is actually a tremendous display of how you ignore everything you don't like and read only what you to. Remember, not a single medical organization in the world afaik recommends circumcision. Many, as provided, actively recommend against it. 

Without medical necessity, educate *the patient* and let him decide when he's able.

Again perhaps next time we'll better discuss the costs of circumcision. You continue to talk as if it's 'free' but it comes at potentially significant cost *to the recipient*. You've conveniently ignored all that.

183,"&gt;For example, everyday less you'll hear the particle ""lo"", which can be found in other dialects of Catalan outside of the Northeastern one.

Yep, heard people using that when I was in Lleida. Was weirded out a little at first because I thought they were just mixing Spanish and Catalan but then I realized that they're not. In my dialect (Meridional Valencian) we use El/La/Els/Les, coinciding with Eastern Catalan. Well, we do use Lo, but in situations like in Spanish ""Lo més bo"" or ""Lo bonico"".


&gt;Using it is in the eyes of some people ""rural or primitive"" and a reason to be mocked. So I guess that's what is happening. People don't want to be different from the majority and tend to auto-supress those beautiful words that make their dialect unique. 

Sad to hear, what can I say :(

Personally speaking I'm not that much of a fan of Eastern Catalan just like most Valencians because... it sounds weird to us, but at least the language is not dying there... 

In regard to standardization I'm actually on the opposite side of the boat, my dialect is pretty much the standard (with some eh, ""corrections"") and recently there was drama about how the new Valencian Channel (Àpunt) recruited way more people here (in my area) than from Castellón or Nearby Valencia because of the accent. So if you wanna feel ""diallectaly dominant"" you should come to Gandia sometime, as long as you pronounce your rs at the end of words :D

We as Catalan Speakers in Spain also must understand that we benefit from the sheer fact that we're at an advantaged position vs Spanish compared to Galician, Basque, and Asturian Language Speakers, because our language is numerically bigger and there's no linguistic parallel in the world to ours. Imagine if your, mine, and the Balearic Islands' Government united to promote our language and get better ""dialectal"" interlinks between each other?

I would concur with this assessment. And by the way: That's precisely why Karl Marx of all people was so fond of him and, for a time, the only European intellectual corresponding with him.

And by the way #2: Don't forget Nixon. Yeah, he was all sorts of bad. But when it comes to foreign policy, he may very well have pulled one of the biggest diplomatic stunts in the second half of the 20^th century when he went to China. Somehow, that part of his legacy always seems to get lost.

&gt; What Europeans have totally lost site of is the smaller picture, while Americans have lost site of the bigger picture. 

Fair point. That's why I believe Americans and Europeans should be talking more to each other, despite the dreadful news and twitter feeds of the day. 

You see, every time I talk to my relatives in the US, the conversation sooner or later ends up in a place where they feel that the US have to do the heavy lifting to 'keep us safe' ('us' as in 'the West') while we Euros just sit around and enjoy our vast inherited riches without showing any ambitions at all.

That's the part when I tell them that the reason we are able to actually enjoy the riches we have is because we went out of the Empire business a long time ago, and ever since then, the quality of life for the average Joe has improved to levels no-one could have imagined, because running an Empire means incurring the costs to maintain it and manage *its* decline, which doesn't necessarily mean *our* decline.

Also the kind of low profits - high frequency launches musk envions has yet to form

322,"That was the original definition. Liberal - for liberty - for freedom. In both social and economic policies. 

Liberalism in Europe came to be in the 1700s and the 1800s, first thinkers like Voltaire and Adam Smith, then a couple of political (UK) and violent (France 1830) revolutions by the growing merchant class who wanted free trade. Then, as the merchant class established as the dominant power, some liberals adopted socially conservative policies. Nowadays European liberalism can feature both social liberalism and conservatism, as long as the core principles of economic liberty and free trade are there. Tories, Liberal Democrats, La République En Marche, Ciudadanos all show different faces of liberalism. (Tories less so, now that there is a big anti-free trade block there).

ALDE is basically a block for both economically and socially liberal, but still mostly centrist parties in Europe.

In US, sometime in the 1800s or 1900s, people started using the word ""liberal"" as a synonym for all emancipatory movements, and then forgot about the economic meaning.

This wierdo absolutely seriously wrote articles in his own book ""[Conspiracy](https://www.e-reading.club/book.php?book=85174)"" about vampires, magic of blood, secrets of the Amazons, unicorn order. 

""[Vampires are agents of evolution](http://allconspirology.org/books/Aleksandr-Dugin_Konspirologiya/20)"": 

&gt;In other words, representatives of the Vampire Order stand behind the ""humanitarian"" movements for ""evolution"" and ""survival"". This is confirmed by the existence of more or less secret scientific centers on the problems of physical immortality that existed and, apparently, continue to exist in some countries, and especially in the US and Russia.

He's not just average level weirdo, he's fucked up level wierdo. He considers Space an illusion, an Internet as tool of Satan, and his statements long ago went to the Runet as memes:

[Egor Letov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yegor_Letov), post-punk/psychedelic musician, about Dugin:

&gt;... we once lived at Kuryokhin's house - Dugin, I and Nyrych. We wake up, I open window, Dugin lies pensively on the bed, asks: ""But where is Omsk located?"" I say: ""Well, there: in the south of Siberia. Near to Kazakhstan "". 

&gt;-""Is Kazakhstan close to us? And what if the Kazakhs were poisoned wind? They can poison wind! Quickly close the window: wind is poisoned!"" And, quite seriously frightened terribly, began to walk around the room. ""Kazakhs, damn it, the wind poisoned - how can I go? So it is, for sure. I know they have **reed people**. They have a lake Balkhash, and there in large quantities grows reeds, reeds. And there live cane, **reed people** who never protrude, only breathe through tube reeds."" Then he thought again, thought and said: ""And in the middle of Balkhash there is a huge island, where there lives a giant, **gigantic cat**, to whom they all worship."" (...) He says: ""Damn, reeds! **Reed people** around, what do you do? They can arrange an invasion! This is all - then we are finished! If reed people get out - and they climb on us with their cat! And the cat is huge, three meters tall! ""

Literally everyone is laughing at him. He is specially called for a talk show so that he can talks about ""how Jesus created Space to hide the Heaven"" and ""that [God is against the Internet""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74QT-Wcgjbs). He was long fired from all [posts at Institutes](https://vz.ru/news/2014/6/27/693142.html), and all people he pointed out in his ""Fundamental of geopolitics"" as so-authors - deny it.

Is it like this all across the nordics?

Anyway suggestions from Italy so you vikings can keep cool: 

to keep your house at the minimum temperature possible lower your venetians as to let the smallest possible sunlight in and open all the windows. The shadow will chill the rooms, the difference in temperature with the outdoors and open windows will create a cool breeze. At least that’s how i do it. 

To keep you at the minimum temperature have cold water pour from the tap on your wrists for some time. If you don’t have an abundance of water due to the heat wave fill a bowl of water and put it in the fridge. Your wrists are full of blood vessels and will quickly transport cooler blood across your body. Also freshen with cold water the back of your head. Idk why this works but it does.

337,"&gt;I know that even the ability to upgrade the stuff is quite limited; only Israel got some more extensive rights. That always struck me as a bit of a weird thing, seems like you're making yourself very dependant on the US with the F-35.

I think that was part of the appeal before Trump. As the idea was being apart of a core group of members committed to an effective coalition force. This cannot be understated. Anyone who knows anything about the F-35 knows that the asymmetrical benefits(networking and interoperability)  offered by the F-35 is easily game changing yet only possible in America as Europe's military aviation industry lacked behind key fifth gen characteristics by at least 55 or generously 20-25 years.  

F-117 was the 1980's, B-2 was 1990's, the Raptor was 2005, F-35 was 2015 for operational level. What's the docket for Europe look like? 2035 for UK, 2040 for France/Germany. That's very very very very far behind.

People who complain about reliance on the US for military/upgrades/what not are kind of missing the point. The whole idea of a F-35 and fifth generation plane is that reliance. Rather than blame the US, Europeans should be blamed for allowing them to miss the boat on key technologies in aviation right now(stealth and networking). Those two things are infinitely more important than speed, or agility.  It's just how military technology has evolved. 

I'll give you an example. If USA in 1945 at the apex of its perceived power wanted to destroy a random neutral countries military and industrial power how long would it take? Like USA decided to invade Switzerland for their gold or something. It would probably take months to plan and weeks if not months to achieve. USA in 2018 can wipe can cripple a countries economy in a matter of hours. I'm talking instantly lose the war kind.

 A singular US carrier task force could wipe up 70% of a nations economy by itself. Why? Because economies, communications, and pretty much everything else have become interconnected. That's why it was a natural process military tech trended towards coalitions, networks and interoperability. What has spawned as a result of technology getting more deadly? Look to the founding principles of NATO, an attack on one is an attack on all. Big nation militaries can wipe out shittier militaries in days. Remember, Iraq part 1, Afghanistan and Iraq part 2 were all complete, and utterly devastating military victories. The problem came after military victories. The principle holds the same. A smaller nation has no chance anymore without interoperability and collective defense.

Two nuclear attack subs. Carrying 40(upgrades are looking at 60-70+ easily) Tomahawks each.

A total of 100 strike planes, and like 300 cruise missiles. Strike planes mop up while cruise missiles target key infrastructure. A small nation would be sent back to the stone age. Remember this isn't Afghanistan. The shitty quality of infrastructure and communications is actually their advantage as a somber principle of ""it can't get worse,"" applies to the Taliban.

Tsja, dat zul jij als linkse zeker wel zo zien. Maar een rechts iemand zal zeggen dat het doel van links is om de armen arm te laten blijven door belastingcadeautjes zonder ze daadwerkelijk verder te helpen, het versperren van handel, het doen laten krimpen van de banenmarkt etc. En dat rechts mensen de vruchten van hun eigen arbeid laat plukken en behouden, zonder dat ze zich zorgen hoeven te maken dat de overheid deze van ze zal afnemen.

435,"1) You get taxed less on depositing money on pension than general income taxation. So an incentive to increased pension payments.  

2) Yields on stocks have generally been higher than interest rates, so seen over more than a few years it was better to buy shares than pay off on a cheap mortgage.

3) There is a tax deduction for interest payments on a mortgage, and combined with low interest and low inflation there is a gamble that property values will increase. Many experienced the pleasure of living free for a decade or more in one of the major cities (particularly Copenhagen) because the cost of living including taxes and loan payments was less than the not taxed capital gain on selling private property.

471,"Yes and no. 

Yes, Jesus Christ was ""personal"", and considered an aspect of God by Christians.

But that's the thing: A personal God is not so much a matter of belief in an Anthropomorphic-capable being, but rather whether or not that being has an Ego, a sense of Self, and (most importantly) is someone who you can establish a relationship with.

A good example of an Anthropomorphic non personal deity would be [Crom, from the Conan fictional series]: He is a god that it's known to not really care about his worshipers prayers, but values courage and tenacity, as is thus invoked by warriors on the direst of circumstances... But pretty much only in dire circumstances, as a sort of ""Hail Marry"" (puns!). Thus, there is no real relationship between the believer, and Crom.

It is commonly accepted that this also the nature of the Gods in the Classical world: They didn't want your prayers, at least not from the laymen. They did expect your honors, and expected your offerings and sacrifice, they they'd make your life a living hell. 

A non-Anthropomorphic, non personal God, would be The Force from the Star Wars universe: It's a thing. People know it's a thing, and devote their lives to study it, master it, and in exchange for their study and devotion they are rewardaded with all sorts of supernatural (aka miraculous) abilities.

Here they state the only due to what has been labeled as terrorist attack are about 400. 
Only the ones labeled as terrorist attacks.
For the number I have stated, I don’t have exact source, I heard it in a political commentator show. But that would include probably other factors, such as murder rate increase and done by migrant background since 2014.

But the number does not include those who have died on the journey in Lybia and other transit areas (which if you check some reports, you will find some really terrible ones), along in the sea. 
The easy access into the EU and the welcoming nature of politicians and other important cultural figures have likely played major role in their decision making to make the journey. 

There is also a major difference between refugees, which should be helped, but in the first(!) safe country and not of choice.

What does he mean by that? It sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.


Also, is it not worrying that he states ""the new state that we are building is an illiberal state, a non-liberal state""? I take it to mean he is making his party's political leaning as the default direction of the state.


Honestly, the implications of his actual message seem a lot more frightening to me that the out-of-context conclusions that he might be praising Putin.

For some 500 years after the Latin conquests of italy, it was only the Latins (the original romans) in the Italian peninsula who had Roman citizenship. The Etruscans, Samnites, Umbrians, Italiotes ect were just subjects until a couple of wars was fought over the subject.
The Greeks were still Greeks in ethnicity, but they called themselves ""romanioi"" all the way up to the Ottoman conquest due to their citizenship. You could be a Roman citizen, but your ethnicity still made a big difference (especially in the political climate).

I blame more Western Europe/America for not intervene directly in the Ukrainian War. Europe was really morally obligated to do that - Ukraine had given up its nuclear arsenal with the understanding that the West would intervene if its borders where threatened. What did we do? A Chamberlain 2 - Peace in our time 2, we sold Ukraine of - the ultimate cynical cowardliness.

Don't mix brands with shareholders, the owners just chose to separate the legal entity in two, but they were still the same owners of the same value. What they chose to do with their assets later (for example sell one but not the other, or be more risk takers with one but not the other) is a completely different thing. Europe's legal system encouraged them not to build a conglomerate but a focused set of companies. 

One could also argue that the fact they exposed that new company to new capital while retaining control of the classic established brand was a smart move. They get risky speculative investment into the new business while keeping the golden cash cow safe. Would it be this successful without that cash? Their share in that new company might have become smaller, but that's not failure if the ROI on their share increased.

671,"Part 1

You raised a lot of interesting topics, and I had no time to answer everything right away. Your points make a lot of sense to me, and I respect your thoughtful comment very much. However I will try to present a different perspective, which accounts for Russian mindset, as I see it. And my language might seem harsh, but, please, bear with me.

&gt;EU must be **seen** to be vigilant and prepared to contain Russia by itself - with or without NATO. Nothing else will satisfy the EU's Eastern European members and partners 

It makes a lot of sense, and this is a really important topic. It actually might be a biggest obstacle in EU-Russia relations. I don't have an immediate solution to this. I don't know how EU is going to resolve this conundrum. But probably, one day EU has to face a difficult decision. Does EU want it's foreign policy be decided in Berlin, Paris, Hague, Rome and Brussels, on the basis of vital interests of major European powers inside EU, or does EU want it foreign policy to be decided in Baltic states' capitals and Warsaw, fueled by US interest in maintaining an eternal divide between EU and Russia, as in ""divide and rule"". 

To me it is hard to imagine how this huge EU construction can ever become a big political player on the world stage, if most crucial strategic decisions, concerning foreign policy, will be decided in Vilnius or Tallinn.

May be at some point a decision is to be made: a cooperation with whole of Eurasia through Russia and safe Eastern flank with a nuclear superpower, or an attempt to satisfy concerns of Baltic states and Poland, at the expense of open hostility towards Russia. The thing is, I don't see how their concerns will be ever satisfied either way. I don't think that those countries can really feel safer in case of permanent hostile scenario vs Russia. 

Of course, in order to maintain stability, EU has to take into account concerns of all it's members, no matter how justified they are. I don't know how EU will resolve it, may be some compromises could be made here. May be US will withdraw it's presence from Europe voluntarily and will thus stop supporting Eastern EU countries in it's current approach towards Russia. May be some arrangement can be made, when Poland will be given it's own little sphere of influence, which will satisfy all major sides.

&gt;the Eastern European spheres of influence it tries so hard to maintain are only valuable while there are enemies on its borders. But imagine, for a moment, an alternate possibility - one where both the Eastern European states and Russia itself were equal partners in a European Union that stretched from ocean to ocean 

That was basically a dominant idea for a lot of people in Russia, including politicians, including, you might laugh, early Putin, during first 1,5-2 decades after the collapse of USSR. But now it's clear, it's just not going to happen, because West does not care about making Russia a friend at all.

There were very high expectations and a lot of trust towards West and Europe in particular in Russia. And the question of incorporating Russia into Western world should have been the number one issue for the West. But due to lack of strategic thinking, they did just nothing. They just kicked Russia while it was weak and that's about it. 

They supported expansion of anti-Russian organizations like NATO (and many others), supported shooting in the democratically elected parliament from tanks, meddled in elections, promoted and supervised economic reforms, that resulted in economic collapse and 10000% yearly inflation, supported ISIS-like terrorists in Chechnya, destroyed countries allied to Russia with disregard to international law, openly instigated coups to establish extreme anti-Russian governments in neighboring countries, engaged in propaganda in the media for decades, broke military treaties that promoted peace in Europe, promoted anti-missile defense which is a huge threat to strategic balance, did not allow Russian businessmen to buy any decent technologies which Russia desperately needs etc. 

In the end there was no indication that West ever wanted to treat Russia as a friend, or even equal partner, despite tremendous opportunities that existed for decades. As of now, the % of people in Russia, who believe that West wants anything other, than undermining Russia, is almost non existent. Which is a bad thing of course.

What you say might be set as a goal for a beautiful future, but in the near future it's just not going to happen. ",,/r/europe/comments/8z2rtw/europe_needs_to_start_planning_for_a_future_with/e2jvwuc/,lncognitoErgoSum,1531847837

(please read Part 1 first)

&gt;Eastern European states and Russia itself were equal partners in a European Union

Is it even possible in principle even if Russia would be an EU member? Is it even possible to build a functioning entity, that can take bold actions, where Germany is truly equal to Montenegro? I don't have a clear answer but it is just a rhetorical side note.Spheres of influence are not Russian invention, it's just how geopolitics work since the dawn of time. From Russian perspective, decades ago, Europe delegated their sovereignty in international and military affairs to USA (may be for a good reason). And since then Europe does not play geopolitics game. It mastered the economy and social progress game. But as for geopolitics, at some point they just lost the understanding how this thing works at all. USA, Russia, China play geopolitics game. And Europe is living in a fantasy world where wars can not happen, geopolitics is a thing of past, making one sided concessions earns you respect, everybody admires Europe because of their values and not because of high income and standards of living, everybody has to listen to Europe just because of their moral superiority, etc. May be some of these things work inside EU, and it is beautiful, but it is not how the rest of the world operates. If EU wants to become a leading international player, it has to learn the rules of geopolitical game from scratch. And they will make mistakes along this way.

&gt;Germany made this strategic pivot

It is true and it did bring a lot of benefits for Germany. But let's not forget what was the context for that. Germany capitulated in a war and was basically an occupied country under foreign supervision. Real options were quite limited. And Germany received massive support through Marshall plan because USA was reasonably afraid that USSR will take control of whole of Europe otherwise. If West would work out some kind of Marshall plan towards Russia in 90s, we would live in a different world now.

&gt;**it must let its Eastern European ambitions go**

How come it is Russia who has to let it's ambitions go and not EU? And it's more like for EU they are ambitions, and for Russia it is a matter of secutiry. Russia's frontiers were in Eastern Germany, but she let her ambitions go, and what did it get in return? NATO countries on the borders and an image of a declining weakling, who gave up it's interests for nothing. And there are still conflicts, the only difference is now Russia has to resolve them on it's own borders. From Russian perspective, Russia learned her lesson in a hard way and will not repeat it.The thing is, Europe considers Russia as something like a big Bulgaria. They have to submit to the rules the way Bulgaria has, but it is just a bigger country. But Russia is a different thing. For centuries straight Russia was never below top3 of world's great powers. If you want to deal with Russia you have to acknowledge their natural interests.

&gt;It is less about prizes, and more about obligations.  
&gt;  
&gt;the EU will be put in a conundrum - if they refuse because these states are supposed to be Russia's vassals forevermore, the EU will look weak

According to this logic EU has to expand infinitely because otherwise it will look weak. If Afghanistan, Mongolia and Lebanon will ask to enter EU next, EU will be obliged to accept them?

&gt;How are Ukraine, Belarus at al crucial to Russia today?

For centuries they were arguably parts of one somewhat united superethnos. They are Russian speaking and families are intermixed. Everyone have relatives in 2 or 3 of these countries. Half of soviet leaders were Ukrainians. And of course there are economic ties and issues of security. It is like East and West Germany for a lot of people. But for a lot of people it's not. So it's complicated.

&gt;Protection from a land invasion?

From what I understand (and I might miss something), the issue with NATO is not invasion. The basis of Russian sovereignty is the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction. Adding vast territory of Ukraine to NATO might lead to deployment of missiles there, which will cover all of European Russia. They might even be non nuclear. But they will be able in a matter of couple minutes hit all Russian nuclear facilities and strategic points so it will be disarmed. This situation might lead to collapse of strategic nuclear balance in the world.

&gt;Russia's obsession with preserving its Near Abroad and by extension generating the excuse for NATO to expand eastward seems backward to me

NATO acts regardless of whether they have excuses or not. They have a strategic goal of undermining Russia and it is their only goal. Most of NATO expansion happened while Russia-West relations were on all time high.

&gt;Europe must generate the capacity to threaten Russia with that force in order to be treated as an equal by Moscow.

Threatening Russia will achieve nothing, because Russia will not let go of what she considers her core interests, unless she is somehow completely destroyed. It just will be a game of Russian roulette, until only one survives. And for Russia it is not a new thing to play a survival game against united Europe, and usually it does not end well for united Europe. Russia does not claim to control Poland of Hungary anymore. It just wants it's interest to be respected in post soviet countries (mostly not even including Baltics) and a non hostile rest of Europe.I do not see vital interest of both sides that has to lead to hostilities. I don't think a unification can happen in a near future, but a cooperation, based on a fair deal has to be beneficial for everyone.21st century will be driven by South Asian region.

&gt; Canada fired back on July 1 with levies on $16.6-billion worth of American goods, including steel and aluminum, plus consumer products such as whisky, ketchup and frozen pizza.

&gt; The United States cited a “national security” provision, Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, as the reason for imposing its steel and aluminum tariffs. The Trump administration says it has to keep foreign imports out of the country to build up the domestic metal-making capacity so it can make its own steel and aluminum in the event of a war. The United States argues that this justifies the tariffs under international rules, but that other countries’ retaliation is illegal because they imposed tariffs without going through the WTO.

Canada's answer should be that they also want to preserve whatever domestic pizza industry they have. In the event of a war with the US, who would make them pizza?",,/r/europe/comments/8ziszr/united_states_suing_canada_eu_others_at_wto_for/e2jmqpt/,[deleted],1531840313

Oh my God, thinking of your own people first is extremism.  How awful!  A US president should seek to rectify decades of policies that put America last?  Gosh, I can see why you're angry.

The world has long demanded an end to American meddling and bullying.  Now you're getting exactly what they asked for, and now you're *still* angry. 


Well, you're getting what you asked for, an America that's going to stop playing world police. I hope you're happy, but I seriously doubt it. I am starting to understand just what anti-Americanism really means. It doesn't mean pro-social justice or pro-equality or any of those things. It just means find out what the Americans are doing and take the opposite view.

If the Americans want to dominate Europe, then that's bad and we need to criticize it. If the Americans want to go home and disband NATO, then we need to criticize that, too. It's such a hateful ideology, but I guess we Americans deserve it. We're bad people.

784,"I think we're mostly in agreement. I don't conflate the two issues but I do seem them both as genital mutilation. I haven't fully explained my reasoning, which I think will resolve it. 

The World Health Organization’s definition of Female Genital Mutilation is ""all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons."" When you remove gender it becomes *'all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external genitalia or other injury to the genital organs for non-medical reasons.’* Notice there is no requirement about how much it has to adversely affect someone. It doesn't need a demonstrated level of harm or impairment. It's a simple full stop, if it’s not done for a medical reason it's genital mutilation.

When I review the [data on table 1 for circumcision](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) the numbers are not there to medically justify the procedure.

Therefore I conclude circumcision meets the definition of genital mutilation. Anatomy is affected without medical need, and that's the very definition of genital mutilation. Context, social or otherwise, is not part of the definition. And I see no reason why this excellent definition can not, or should not, be applied regardless of gender.

1013,"Ah, the ""poor oppressed Russia :'("" defense.

Russia could've stopped its aggression (in Georgia, in Ukraine, in threatening the Baltic states etc.), reformed its economy, opened up to the world. You have immense wealth in resources. Imagine if the wealth from all those resources were used for supporting new businesses, to build up infrastructure, invested in new technology, among other positive things. Imagine if Russia had admitted its historical faults and started to work towards geniunely bettering relations. There is barely any hatred between Germany and France despite two world wars and a long history of mutual hatred, and unforgiveable acts of horror by Germany during WWII. A friendship like between them could happen between Russia and all of the EU, if Russia didn't insist on being our enemy. Maybe Russia could even become an EU member (if they wanted to) and be one of the top influencers in it. I believe if you asked anyone in Europe, a large majority of them would love nothing more than to have Russia as a free and friendly nation that is an important trade parter and respected as an equal European nation, the likes of Germany or France or the UK. 

Estonia is quickly on its way towards being on par with the Nordic countries. Poland is finally rising and some say it will be one of the greats in Europe in just a couple of decades (if they don't go too far with handing power to a single party). Why could Russia not do the same? 

Putin could've been known as the man who opened Russia and reformed it into a wealthy, free, respected and loved nation. He might've been known as Putin the Great. 

But instead, he (and all the Russians who support him and his cronies) chose to support aggression, corruption, blind nationalism and decay. ",Finland,/r/europe/comments/8za1ow/salvini_hints_at_eu_vetoes_unless_sanctions_on/e2j64jl/,Aarros,1531818459

1036,"The European Union’s foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, sent a personal, sharply worded letter to Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan, asking him to provide proof of his ministry’s “vague and unsubstantiated” allegations that the EU is financing terror and boycott activities against Israel through nonprofit organizations.

In her letter, which was obtained by Haaretz, Mogherini responds to a report issued in May by the Strategic Affairs Ministry titled “The millions given by EU institutions to NGOs with ties to terror and boycotts against Israel.”

In the letter Erdan sent to Mogherini along with the report, he wrote, “An in-depth research study conducted by my ministry has revealed that in 2016 the EU funded fourteen European and Palestinian NGOs which openly and clearly promote BDS.” He also charged that, “Several of the BDS-promoting NGOs that receive direct and indirect EU funding are linked to EU-designated terrorist organizations.” Erdan added that such funding undermines the EU-Israel relationship and “also undermines the chances for peace.”

Subsequently the report was leaked to the Israel Hayom newspaper, which reported it under the headline, “Millions of euros of hate.” On the day the report came out, Erdan tweeted, “The EU continues to finance BDS organizations, some of which are linked to terror organizations, with tens of millions of shekels a year.”

In her letter, which was sent to Erdan on July 5, Mogherini writes, “Allegations of the EU supporting incitement or terror are unfounded and unacceptable. The title of the report itself is also inopportune and misleading; it mixes terrorism with the boycott issue and it creates unacceptable confusion in the public eye regarding these two distinct phenomena.”

She added that the EU strongly objects “to any suggestion of EU involvement in supporting terror or terrorism,” and that “vague and unsubstantiated accusations serve only to contribute to disinformation campaigns.”

Mogherini also claims that the report in question contained errors. “For example, of the 13 organizations listed in the report, 6 do not receive EU funding for activities in Palestine and none of them receives EU funds for BDS activity,” she wrote. She also noted, “In addition, as reported widely by the Israeli press in recent weeks, a number of the organizations referred to in the report also receive funding from other international donors including the United States.”

With regard to the alleged support for the BDS movement, Mogherini writes to Erdan, “The European Union has not changed its position regarding the so-called ‘Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions’ (‘BDS’) movement. While it upholds its policy of clearly distinguishing between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied by it since 1967, the EU rejects any attempts to isolate Israel and does not support calls for boycott. The EU does not fund actions that are related to boycott activities. However, simply because an organization or individual is related to the BDS movement does not mean that this entity is involved in incitement to commit illegal acts, nor that it renders itself ineligible for EU funding.

“The EU stands firm in protecting the freedom of expression and freedom of association in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. Freedom of expression is also applicable to information or ideas, ‘that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population.’ Any action that has the effect of closing the space in which civil society organizations operate by unduly restricting freedom of association should be avoided.”

With regard to the claims of support for terrorism, Mogherini writes, “The EU has very strict rules to screen and vet the beneficiaries of EU funds. We take any allegation of misuse of EU funds very seriously and are committed to investigate all those presented with substantive evidence. We are confident that EU funding has not been used to support boycott of Israel or BDS activities and certainly not to finance terrorism.”'
At the end of the letter, Mogherini invites Erdan to Brussels to present proof of his allegations. “You and your officials are welcome to come to Brussels at any point and present evidence you may have to substantiate these allegations,” she writes. “In the meantime, we invite your government to pursue a productive dialogue on civil society issues with us, as foreseen by the EU-Israel Action Plan, in a spirit of open and transparent cooporation rather than through unsubstantiated material being publicized without prior dialogue and engagement.”

In the report issued by the Strategic Affairs Ministry, it was claimed that in 2016 the EU had transferred more than 5 million euros (nearly $5.9 million) to organizations “that promote delegitimization and boycotts against Israel.” Though the report was described as “in-depth,” most of its claims were based on a small number of cases from open sources.

Haaretz examined some of the claims the report made and found that the interpretation of some of the incidents described deviated from the information they were based on. For example, a boycott of the settlements alone is occasionally interpreted as support for BDS, even though the organizations in question don’t necessarily support, or even do specifically oppose, applying the movement’s principles to Israel proper. This interpretation dovetails with the way the Israeli government in recent years has been trying to blur the distinction between the two.
However, for the EU the distinction is significant. While the EU doesn’t directly fund activities that promote a boycott of the State of Israel – not including the settlements – it sees the ideological support of the movement as legitimate freedom of political expression. The EU can monitor the use of its funding, since it is generally allocated in advance for specific activities and there is ongoing supervision.

In other cases, the ministry’s report defines as “support for terror” specific instances in which Hamas or Popular Front operatives took part in other activities that were supported by NGOs that got EU funding. On that basis Israel is accusing the EU of indirectly funding terror. A reading of the report also shows that a large number of the allegations are reminiscent of claims made by right-wing organizations, primarily NGO Monitor.

Erdan responded to this report by stating: “It’s sad that the European Union’s foreign minister has once again chosen to hide her head in the sand and ignore the clear evidence that the BDS organizations which receive funding from it, either directly or indirectly, are linked to or cooperate with terrorist organizations like Hamas and the Popular Front. Mogherini admits that most of the funded organizations which appear in my ministry’s report indeed promote boycotts of Israel, yet she employs the ridiculous excuse that the money is given to the boycott organizations but used for other purposes, and not for their activities aimed at boycotting Israel.

“Regrettably, excuses like these also represent the European Union’s policy on other issues, such as its attitude toward Iran and Palestinian terror,” he continued. “On these issues, too, the EU has chosen to act like an ostrich and behave as if it were blind to the hatred, incitement and boycotts.”

The EU commented for this news report by saying, “We usually do not comment on leaked correspondence with our partner countries, but on the question of allegations contained in the recent report published by the Ministry of Strategic Affairs government ministry, our headquarters thoroughly examined the report and came to the conclusion that allegations presented in the report were unfounded. 

“The EU has strict rules to screen and vet the beneficiaries of EU funds. We are therefore confident that EU funds have not been used to finance terrorism.”

Our fight against terrorism has never been stronger and we have always maintained clear positions on terrorist organisations.We are also confident that our funds have not been used to support boycott of Israel, in particular not BDS activities,"" the comment read.

""The EU rejects any attempt to isolate Israel and does not support calls for a boycott. At the same time, the EU stands firm in protecting freedom of expression and freedom of association in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. 

As always, the EU investigates any serious allegations made related to such activities and funding. Should there be any evidence to substantiate such claims Israeli authorities will always be welcome to present this to us as part of an open and transparent dialogue.""",,/r/europe/comments/8zjl4o/eu_blasts_israeli_minister_you_feed/e2j6a0y/,Chukapu,1531818786

1049,"It's such a complex issue that you can't just note it down as men not wanting to help themselves. Everyone wants help and support, men aren't beasts, they're human too, as seen by this threads subject.

&gt;Maybe there are fewer male victims wanting to stand up and tell their stories?

This is a large part of it. Men's issues aren't taken serious in western society, and as I already showed, there isn't much support for it at all. Additionally, the idea of men talking about their issues have been shunned by culture, with comments such as ""man up"" and ""take it like a man"", meaning shut up and stop whining. I believe men have always been conditioned by western society to think they they shouldn't show emotion and that they aren't allowed to speak about their issues as a man.

The fact that there isn't much support or will to listen to men's issues also means that these male victims don't speak up, as there isn't many at all that will listen to them or take their issues serious compared to women's issues.

I think modern ""feminism"" is a reflection of modern western society. Their intense focus on women's issues and disregard for men's issues seems to fit with the general perception in society, especially if you combine it with the examples I listed earlier.

**Trump, obviously, defended him blaming democrats for letting themselves get hacked (does this mean that he agrees with the US intel agencies that Putin’s hackers did hack the DNC then?) and goes on about the DNC server (he’s rehashing “Hillary’s emails,” I guess).

Then why would you *blame* them for things that happen after they leave?

Seems like you're just looking for a scapegoat.

&gt;I'm just saying it's not fair to point at them and say, ""look how shit they, if the colonisers made them poor why aren't they rich yet?"".

I never said that. What I pointed out is the marked contrast between the claims that all problems are to blame on the colonizer, and the fact that in many cases their political and economical situation went downhill after the colonizer left. Or for example the often repeated claim that ""the colonizers drew bad borders and that causes all problems"". Surely that can be a problem... but the whole point of independence is that you can change that. We're now several generations of politicians past independence, if those borders were so obviously wrong, then why have practically no ex-colonies agreed to peacefully redraw the borders?

Do I agree that the less educated or the less intelligent are more susceptible to being misled or misguided? That's a good question, and one whose response demands a multifaceted critique. I think that any movement that taps into the emotional framework of people makes them more susceptible to being misled or misguided. As we are not perfectly rational people, I would argue that even the intelligent are as likely to be lead astray as the unintelligent, if the movement is structured convincingly enough. Around 2014, many left-wingers, who some would argue are more intelligent on average than right-wingers, bit down on a fact that was less than accurate in describing one element of society: I'm talking about the statistic that for every $1 a man makes a woman makes only 75 cents. This statistic is true when you compare **all** working men to **all** working women, without taking into consideration what type of job, how much experience one has, how good one is at negotiating, etc. It's not an accurate way to judge society, yet many on the left jumped on it because they knew it was a statistic that would benefit their movement but not necessarily their intellect. 

I don't believe that Trump voters are less intelligent than left-wingers, though they are less educated; I believe they're more desperate.

1376,"&gt;Why are vaccines being developed? Is it because near 100% circumcision for the last 80 years hasn't done anything in the US? Why is Bill Gates famously trying to develop a better condom? Is it because condoms are actually effective? See where rhetorical questions go? Extra question mark?  

Bill Gates wants to develop a new condom because current condoms are not effective at a population level........if they were effective why is he looking for something better to replace them?

&gt;Omg, condoms were around during the HIV studies. And if there were any studies from before condoms were available that's seriously old and needs to be reaffirmed. Lol would you accept that kind of data for any other intervention? I can't stop laughing. Plus, there's there a new great alternative prevention of a condom! No body part removal required! lol

I've never called it a condom alternative. People don't use condoms during every sexual encounter. Couples, drunk people, people with HIV on ART frequently do not use condoms. Are you really laughing? 

&gt;..the potential for harm outweighs greatly greatly exceeds the potential of doing nothing” and there is “functional impairment even if there is no complication.

This is where the debate is. Potential for harm exceeds the 20-60% reduced STI rates, reduced cancer incidence, reduced HIV incidence? 

&gt;And the failure is not on condoms, the failure is on people to not use condoms. Is it time for more rhetorical questions? Is it because circumcision has removed [the most sensitive part of the penis?]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) And then a condom on top makes things worse? Unlike Europe? Where they are intact and seem to have better condom usage? 


Circumcision decreases condom use rates? 
RCT data and observational studies suggest other factors, not circumcision, affect condom use.

&gt;Lol I brought up FGM. Since you kinda want to but not want to discuss it, let's discuss *the reason why it's defined the way it is*. Note this isn't about discussing how bad it is.
&gt;
&gt;The World Health Organization’s definition of Female Genital Mutilation is ""all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons."" Let's remove gender to get:
&gt;
&gt;'all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external genitalia or other injury to the genital organs for non-medical reasons.’
&gt;
&gt;Notice there is no requirement about how much it has to adversely affect someone. It doesn't need a demonstrated level of harm or impairment. It's a simple full stop, no bullshit, if it’s not done for a medical reason it's genital mutilation.

The medical reason is reduced STI rates, cancer incidence, etc

&gt;When I review the [data on table 1](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) the numbers are not there to medically justify the procedure.

Then let your child be at increased risk and let others choose to protect their children.

&gt;Just to note, this isn't about equating the two. This isn’t a harm competition. They both meet the definition of genital mutilation. That doesn't mean they're equally bad, it means they are both genital mutilation.

The medical benefits are numerous.


&gt;
&gt;&gt;Intactisnatural.
&gt;
&gt;Lol so you show that you literally read what you want to read, instead of what's actually written. Lol I can only laugh. You didn't even attempt to bridge it before the strawman fallacy. And yes its's complete strawman since again I didn't say or imply anything of the sort, you created what you wanted and then blew down the strawman. That is in fact the most perfect strawman fallacy that I've ever seen. It'd be like saying because of your username you exhibit delusions of grandeur and narcissism and then rambling on about it.

It's not a strawman. At first glance your name looked like Intactisnatural, implying being natural is a reason one should be intact. I misred your name, relax.
Are you really audibly laughing when you read my reply? If so you should think about seeing a psychiatrist.

I think a lot of Americans of both parties fail to recognize how the US-first extremism of Trump exists in miniature form in nearly every American. We see that more clearly now. Too many US politicians really don't see the US as one of a number of countries, but as the Big One, more important than the rest and therefore a natural leader.

I don't be grudge the US left their dislike of Trump and his policies, but some of their policies are no less US-centric and inward-looking. We could easily end up an insufferable US president who wanted to aggressively fight for the kind of antitraditional culture war policies that seem like a big priority for the US left. That wouldn't be very different from Trump for us. It is still ultimately about the US playing out its own anxieties in other countries.

This is obvious to us now, at least in the Canadian media. Our politicians are conspicuously united over our response to US bluster, and that won't change when a new ""normal"" politician comes to power.

When it is awkward to say things like "" Canada is America's hat"" because it is seen as narcissistic then we can negotiate equally again.

1421,"&gt; I subscribe to the conspiracy theory thay the airforce shot down that last flight

Ridiculous. 

1. They *did* authorise and scramble interceptors to destroy UA 93, and were even willing to order pilots to ram it. This fact was publicly admitted - if they wished to conceal the fact that they had shot it down, they would hardly admit to trying to do so and failing.

2. Shooting down an airliner is not subtle. UA 93 crashed near two towns with numerous civilian witnesses. It could not have been effectively concealed, even if those wishing to conceal it could somehow have suborned the dozens of agencies and tens of thousands of people involved in the aftermath and investigation into total and perpetual silence (I mean, it's not as if American security organisations ever leak or anything. Perish the thought.)

3. Doing so would require foreknowledge that they simply didn't possess. UA 93 crashed at 10:03, NEADS was only alerted at 10:07. Once again, they only reason they didn't bring it down was because they never got the chance.

&gt; the passengers revolting sounds too romantic and ""feel good"" imo

That is a bloody silly reason to disbelieve evidence and give undue credulity to conspiracy theories. ""Feel good"" stuff happens all the bloody time. 

&gt; letting the WH blow up would lead to utter pandamonium

Not really. Bush wasn't there, and all the other high level officials were safe in the PEOC.

1424,"Thank you for the papers. So it appears to me that the debate is really an ethical one. The papers   
are mostly saying that there are multiple health benefits, although they may be minor. Drawbacks are the risk associated with members of the religious community performing the operation, since they are not professional, risk of damage when it is performed at a hospital is basically non-existant. Loss of sensation seems to be debunked by the Morris and Krieger paper, which had the least flawed experiment and wasn't using people who received circumcisions later in life. The non-medical benefits seem to be, at least in this country female preference for circumcised penises, and not being ""different"". The non-medical detriments are feelings of being ""not-whole"" and the ethical concerns of making a permanent choice for an infant. 

Subjectively neither I nor anyone I have spoken to have experienced any of the downsides and while I never suffered any of the medical conditions that circumcision lowers the incidence of, I live in a wealthy area where that would be unlikely anyways. I do remember kids getting mocked for their ""weird dicks"" in school but that was many years ago so who knows what that's like now. My wife is from a country where circumcision is less common and though she says she prefers mine,  it could probably look like a hash brown and she would say the same thing.

&gt;The elements that are common to the use of each of these devices to accomplish circumcision include the following: estimation of the amount of external skin to be removed; dilation of the preputial orifice so that the glans can be visualized to ensure that the glans itself is normal; bluntly freeing the inner preputial epithelium from the epithelium of the glans; placing the device (at times a dorsal slit is necessary to do so); leaving the device in situ long enough to produce hemostasis; **and amputation of the foreskin.**

And Trump is openly colluding with the Russians against his own intel agencies to squelch any investigation into, and to spread as much misinformation about, attempted election interference as possible-just because Trump thinks it’s politically advantageous from a personal to do so, and because his ego can’t allow him to acknowledge it.

That should alarm everyone.

The university I attended in the states (Univ of Tennessee) has [orange as it's major color.](https://i2.wp.com/brand.tennessee.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/colors/UT-Orange-151.png) It's almost the same color as The House of Orange-Nassau. For instance, [here is the orange](https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftenntruth.com%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F12%2F9671444-ncaa-football-kentucky-tennessee-1.jpg&amp;c=sc&amp;w=850&amp;h=560) on an American football uniform and here is the Dutch orange on their [rest-of-the-world football uniform](https://a.scpr.org/i/942d282da6384247ee28f221c574637d/87411-full.jpg). The American orange is PMS 151, which is the exact same orange as designated on the Irish flag. NOTE: Tennessee's orange comes from a flower that grows on the hills around campus, no connection to the significance of orange in Ireland.

So, anyway, my buddy is in the Tennessee Marching Band and they sent a 50-strong contingent to Ireland to march through Dublin on the St. Patrick's Day Parade. He said people weren't rude so much as they were *confused.* He said ""people probably thought we changed our colors to Orange because it's on the flag without knowing *why* the colors were there"". Quite a few people talked to him and people were overall very courteous.

Basically everything about that site - and thus this graphic - is grossly misleading, inaccurate or quite simply *wrong*. 

In this case primarily the inane decision to count pretty much every aircraft in the French airforce as a ""fighter"" while discounting the majority of the Italian, German and British air force inventories. You only get to 296 if you count every French combat aircraft, every Rafale and every Mirage variant. The numbers for Germany and the UK on the other hand don't make any sense, even if one presumes - judging by the ""Interceptor"" label - that the intent was to show only the planes primarily designed for air-to-air combat. 

It makes a whole lot more sense to count every modern combat plane, which would give you ~215 for Germany and Italy and ~290 for France and the UK.

1629,"&gt;Weren’t the Scandinavian populations extremely homogeneous though? 

Look up the Swedification of Skåneland for an answer there. ""Homogenous"" is a relative term, and in Scandinavia like much of Europe, it's complicated. Depending on your view the whole of Scandinavia is extremely homogenous, or internally so divided due to large variations in dialects and isolation that there should be more that 3 countries. Norway is apparently [notorious for dialectical variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language_conflict), and all 3 of the countries have strong regionalism with Denmark being practically a federation. In short, there is a very good reason why the 3 countries never united for long, some of the stuff they did to each other was extreme, and lets not mention  the Sami.

I'm  not even going to go into Ireland, since you calling it ""homogenous"" is hilarious considering there is a reason it is split.

&gt;I think ethnic states with small minority populations are the standard actually.

Look at Asia, Africa and South America and realize that being composed of large regional ethnicities is the norm. Ethno-states are European inventions that needed centuries of forced assimilation and population expulsion to undo regionalism and the demographic gradient into clean sharp lines of cohesive national identity. National mythologies, national dresses, national anthems, even national languages? All made in the last 3 centuries to give a ""common identity"" to a bunch of disperate villages who's common trait was speaking mutually intelligable dialects.

Look at China's cultural revolution for a fully modern and televized example of the process.

&gt;Only America touts itself as a country built on immigrants after all. 

And Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina. Do your homework.

&gt;Doesn’t increased migration from various countries already lead to identity politics and a changing cultural and political landscape at odds with their host countries history? 

A quick counter-question for you before I go into that? Do you think American's were right to fear the increased arrival of catholic immigrants in the 19th century?

1687,"Well, now that you mention it, authoritarian governments are benefiting immensely from new ways to conduct mass surveillance and spread propaganda through smartphones, so that is something substantial.

Waiting a few hours to watch a video or see pictures of events is something we mostly do already, and smartphones aren't even the only way to livestream anyways.

Washing machines practically liberated women from substantial amounts of domestic labour at a time where they began entering the labour force in large numbers, changing their social status and economic opportunities, and contributed more generally to the obliteration of people's reliance on domestic services. Smartphones can suck it.

Overall, you seem to be conflating smartphones with computers and the internet. That's a bit odd for someone born in the 1980s (me too) to do.

If these anti-democratic developments in certain parts of Europe keep going on, and it looks like they will, then the EU can't maintain the current status indeed.

That will mostly be a Western union, but so be it.

1853,"&gt;The formation of nation states did not destroy preexisting cultures.

Of course it did. You telling me there was no cultural difference between Holstein, Copenhagen and somewhere in Northern Jutland 300 years ago to much greater extent than today? Isolation and long travel times breed cultural and linguistic diversity. The normative power of state institutions has led to massive homogenization within national borders due to things like standardized languages, curriculums and state propaganda. The same is now happening on continental scales, but to a much lesser degree.

&gt;There are vast cultural differences in Europe, but the ideology that is being ""imposed"" by the EU on its member states is almost never in conflict with cultural values in each member state. When it is, it is largely for the better.

You must have missed the last few decades. Many many conflicts running along cultural lines. You might feel the better solutions won because the end result happens to run in the direction you agree with, but every conflict has a loser, and that loser didn't go into the disagreement with the idea he was wrong. Lose often enough or over an issue you deem sufficiently important and you see blow back. It is not even about who is ""right"" or ""wrong"", these are aggregated hierarchies of priorities and preferences.

The Euro is great example. 

In theory subsidiarity and decentralization should help manage the disparities, but despite lip service, the EU powers that be are centralists, coming mainly from countries with very strong centralist traditions.

&gt;I have never understood this sentiment that we are ""too different"" — *the only ideology that actually thrives in diversity, and lets diversity thrive, is liberalism.*

As an ideological guideline I agree.

But in the end it's about where and how to resolve practical differences, preferences and conflicts. *Liberalism* is a nice catchword. Now explain to a Greek fisher, who is doing what his dad has been doing, why he has to read, understand and follow 200 pages of guidelines on how to make, handle and clean his nets. Using *Liberalism* does not get you far.

Run a business and employees in Greece like you do in Denmark. Or vice versa. You will fail. That is practical diversity. Mess with it too far or too fast and there will be trouble. ",,/r/europe/comments/8z2cgo/i_think_the_european_union_is_a_foe_us_president/e2hox5y/,LnKBox,1531761174

1897,"Which are you willing to rely solely on for protection, circumcision or a condom? Everyone will go for the condom. If you want both, you are free to circumcise yourself. To use your parlance, circumcision doesn't eliminate STI risk.

Source your statements please. One person's religious rights end at another person's
body. If an adult wants to circumcise himself for his religion, he is absolutely free to do so. You are free to make an argument for someone to circumcise themselves at an age slightly lower than 18, but this is still not an argument for newborn circumcision. I stand by my statement that newborns and children are not having sex. [“The incidence of post-circumcision complications at 2 years is much higher than expected at 11.5%.”](http://spuonline.org/abstracts/2018/P21.cgi) That's beside the obvious issue that every circumcision has removed part of somebody's body, easily argued as a complication. The Ethicist Brian Earp says it well, [“if you assign any value whatsoever to the [foreskin] itself, then its sheer loss should be counted as a harm or a cost to the surgery.”](https://youtu.be/SB-2aQoTQeA?t=2m32s)

You are looking for proof of sexual dysfunction, but this is backwards. The onus of proof is on those that want to circumcise to prove, and I do mean prove, as in beyond a shadow of a doubt, that there is no sexual dysfunction. If you'd like we can discuss the definition of FGM and why it is defined the way it is.

But I’ll cite some information for you anyway, in addition to the presentation that I already linked..

[“circumcised men reported decreased sexual pleasure and lower orgasm intensity. They also stated more effort was required to achieve orgasm, and a higher percentage of them experienced unusual sensations (burning, prickling, itching, or tingling and numbness of the glans penis). For the penile shaft a higher percentage of circumcised men described discomfort and pain, numbness and unusual sensations. In comparison to men circumcised before puberty, men circumcised during adolescence or later indicated less sexual pleasure at the glans penis, and a higher percentage of them reported discomfort or pain and unusual sensations at the penile shaft.”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23374102)

[""Circumcised men...were more likely to report frequent orgasm difficulties after adjustment for potential confounding factors, and women with circumcised spouses more often reported incomplete sexual needs fulfilment and frequent sexual function difficulties overall, notably orgasm difficulties and dyspareunia.""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21672947)

[“This study confirms the importance of the foreskin for penile sensitivity, overall sexual satisfaction, and penile functioning. Furthermore, this study shows that a higher percentage of circumcised men experience discomfort or pain and unusual sensations as compared with the uncircumcised population. Before circumcision without medical indication, adult men, and parents considering circumcision of their sons, should be informed of the importance of the foreskin in male sexuality.”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23374102)

[Professor Ken McGrath describes the foreskin and discusses the mechanical and sensory functions](https://youtu.be/lmToXLVrZ7c?t=1m48s)

Once again cite your sources. 

Wearing a condom is a legitimate point. I just have to laugh at the request ‘stop bringing up strong counter arguments’. In any procedure we have to look at alternative (normal, really) preventions and treatments. [“The cardinal medical question should not be whether circumcision can prevent disease, but how disease can best be prevented.”](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896) Condoms are vastly more effective than circumcision and can actually be relied upon.

On that note let’s look at the outcomes: [the United States combines a high prevalence of STDs and HIV infections with a high percentage of routine circumcisions. The situation in most European countries is precisely the reverse: low circumcision rates combined with low HIV STD rates. Therefore, other factors seem to play a more important role in the spread of HIV than circumcision status. This finding also suggests that there are alternative, less intrusive, and more effective ways of preventing HIV than circumcision, such as consistent use of condoms, safe-sex programs, easy access to antiretroviral drugs, and clean needle programs.](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896)

Lol at strawman fallacy, I never said natural or anything like it.

You’re close, but we have to look at *medical necessity*. That’s the key term. If it’s not medically necessary then the decision goes to the patient to make when he is able.

The Canadian Paediatrics Society puts it well:
&gt;The procedure often raises ethical and legal considerations, in part because it has lifelong consequences and is performed on a child who cannot give consent. Infants need a substitute decision maker – usually their parents – to act in their best interests. Yet the authority of substitute decision makers is not absolute. In most jurisdictions, authority is limited only to interventions deemed to be medically necessary. In cases in which medical necessity is not established or a proposed treatment is based on personal preference, interventions should be deferred until the individual concerned is able to make their own choices. With newborn circumcision, medical necessity has not been clearly established.

I highly recommend watching Brian Earps presentation above.

1926,"Wow. Did we watch the same World Cup or are you just so French you can't see the truth? 

&gt; Again, that is absolutely far from any kind of reality. France waste a bit of time against Belgium. That's it. You cannot compare it to Portugal's entire run played that way.

A bit of time?! Are you f*** kidding me? Again, Mbappé got a yellow card for how much time and how ugly and unsportsmanlike he did it. I would have really enjoyed it if it was his second yellow card, because he deserved to be sent off for the shit he was trying to pull. And France played like that against everyone since Denmark, with Argentina being kind of an exception, but just because they were pretty bad themselves. 

&gt; Yeah, if you make up arbitrary rules to fit your narrative, it helps.

Okay, since you're incapable of finishing a sentence, i'll try again - France had 6 shots, and scored 2 of them. The other two goals come from Mandzukic and a penalty, which obviously don't count. 30% success rate (2 goals out of 6 shots) is pretty good efficiency, and as i said, that's a compliment to the French. 6 shots certainly wasn't a lot, but with such success rate they obviously didn't need more.

&gt; Busy attacking because ... France was leading. It seems that you are trying very hard to bypass that fact.

And you are blind. Go watch a replay of the match, Croatia was attacking since the very start of the match. The first French goal was *literally* the first French attack that got close to Subasic; their second one was the second. At the end of the first half, they had 31% possession and something like 3 shots towards Subasic. For the 10 minutes the score was equal, they didn't try attacking like the Croats did. 

&gt; There's nothing wrong in playing a counter attacks oriented game, period

Okay, if you insist. It's all a game after all, and if it's shit to watch, why would anyone watch it? Don't you think teams like Barça, Real are nice to watch and extremely popular *precisely* because they play good, interesting, offensive football? Nobody wants a shitty team barely doing any offensive effort win - like nobody wanted to see Portugal win in 2016 besides the Portuguese (which perfectly explains where you're coming from).

&gt; And at any rate, France did not play that way before leading the score; again, something you are trying your hardest to ignore to shape the narrative you're defending;

Watch a replay. Not only were France playing extremely defensively (again, Mandzukic's OG was literally their first attack), with 30% possession and much fewer shots regardless of the score, they had extremely shit pass accuracy, especially the first half. Roughly half of their passes ended in a Croatian player. 

&gt; Not even freaking close, what a load of bullcrap. France has been one of the cleanest team in the entire tournament. Very few time wasting outside of the end game against Belgium; very few fouls, let alone hard fouls; very few ref talking; virtually no diving, etc.

They wasted time when it was convenient for them, as most teams do (but not all - Belgium and Croatia are great examples that continued attacking even when leading), but they really overdid it in the most shitty way possible - what Mbappé did was despicable and certainly not on the level of a player for one of the best teams on the World Cup, on the semi-final. Virtually no diving? Are you kidding? If you compare to Neymar (and you're French, if you watch PSG play, you've certainly the ballerina that he is), yes, Mbappé, Giroud and Griezmann ""virtually"" didn't dive at all. If you compare to someone like Lukaku or Mandzukic, they fucking tried hard to get a penalty.

&gt; And still back to you basically discovering football last night. As I already told you, which you should have noted the first time: ""Why would France play nice and lose? To entertain neutrals? This isn't The Avengers. This is football. Playing nice means taking tons of risk if the other team doesn't want to play nice.""

Okay, go watch Ligue 3 in France, because what does it matter if they play nice if they win? I guess you celebrated Portugal's win in 2016, but all the French people i know (i've been living in France since 2012) whined *a lot* that such a team, with such ugly playing, won and certainly didn't deserve it. Funny that it doesn't matter when it's them (only one French person i know accepted the way they won was ugly). 

&gt; They were playing from behind, you ignorant asshat. That's football. Since you discovered football overnight and need it explained, when you are playing from behind, you have to play offensively: you're not going to defend a losing score. Belgium and Croatia were very cautious against France as long as the score was a draw. France was playing more offensively, taking more risks against the two. In both case, it lead to France scoring. From there, France defends that score, and the other team attacks its. That's football. That's not ""oh no the meanie French dont like football"" vs ""the courageous others that play such nice football"".

And since you apparently can't make the difference, Croatia and Belgium played the same way regardless of score. Belgium kept attacking against Brazil and England even when they were ahead; same with Croatia - Russia. It's pretty common for teams to get back on the defensive when you're winning against a dangerous team, but France played like that from the first minute against Belgium and against Croatia, with usually the full 11 players in defence, with the occasional counter attack by Mbappé. 

&gt; Had Belgium or Croatia led the score, they would have defended just the same.

Take a look at Belgium - Brazil, Belgium - England, Croatia - Russia. None of them(excluding Russia because that's all they did) stopped playing just because they were ahead. Don't excuse French mediocrity with ""everybody else does it"". 

&gt; If football rewarded pure skil, France would win it flatly

Wow, are we high and mighty proud with our team. Pure skill and team play wise, yes, France would definitely be in top 4 for this World Cup; not sure i'd give them first place directly since there were other pretty good teams skill and team play wise (Belgium, Croatia, and as much as it pains me to say, England), while other good on paper teams, with great skill but not enough teamwork failed miserably (Argentina, Brazil, Germany).

&gt; Had you any actual experience of football, you would know that

And maybe if you were any good in reading skills, you would have understood what i said. I'll try again - **if** prettier football was rewarded, France wouldn't have won. But it isn't, what matters is winning, regardless of how ugly it is, but as you can see, ""France might have won the cup but Croatia won our hearts"" - everybody but the French prefered Croatia's style of playing. Of course, in a few years most people will just remember France won. Personally i still remember how Italy won in 2006 while France were much better; doesn't change that Italy got that World cup.

&gt; If football was measure your penis to others, France would have been champion even faster.

Okay, you showed you're absolutely not interested in reality and for you what matters is that your dick is the biggest and brightest. Just so you know, for non-French, it's like when France lost in 2006 to Italy and 2016 to Portugal while being the better team - France played ugly and didn't deserve to win any more than Italy or Portugal in 2006 and 2016 respectively. Congrats on finally winning again, but it was extremely unmerited and extremely unpleasant to watch.

&gt; Because you know shit about football. Something highlighed very clearly so far. You think football is about attacking and showing that you can look good attacking; that's simply not football.

Yes, football is all about money and winning, nothing else matters, of course /s So, go ahead watching your gold shitting ballerinas while i enjoy what *i* like - nice, quality, attacking when appropriate football.

2046,"The problem is that in Hungary (and Poland and some others), an increasingly large share of the media is directly under the control and supportive of the ruling party and parrots their talking points and spins everything in favour of them, regardless of the truth. 

In Finland, there are party newspapers like the one I linked you, and different media outlets tend to have some amount of bias towards certain political views (Helsingin Sanomat, for example, tends to be pro-immigration and ""multiculturalism"" for reasons beyond me), but pretty much none of the major media is directly under the control of any political party and scheming to make people support them. 

I think we can both agree whole-heartedly that it is not good for free speech or democracy, that a significant portion of the media is biased towards upholding a specific party. The first and foremost duty of the media is to be a ""watchdog"" that makes sure that the people in power do not overstep their authority, and to make sure that they get called out for lies, corruption, or other breaches of the trust of the people.

2059,"&gt;Voters don't have to legitimize themselves or explain their thoughts to you. 

Voters absolutely have to explain why they'd be okay with voting for fascists, because that impacts more than just them. Democracy does not mean absolve from responsibility, and if we breed an apathetic system where voting is like scratching your sweaty balls, we'll continue driving down the road of demagoguery and populism. 

&gt; That authority doesn't exist - that's what democracy means. 

What? 

&gt; The state doesn't have it, religion doesn't have it, and you - my slimy little man - most definitely don't have it. 

Okay, then, buddy.

&gt; Do you think that we would find the man with the authority to determine who gets to vote, and what the limits are for EU citizens to express their political opinions? 

What the hell are you even talking about? Political parties that advocate for e.g. genocide (i.e. the alt-rights plans for their ethnostate, or the communists crazy ideas about liquidating the bourgeoisie) are already illegal, it doesn't take me to determine that - because reasonable people have already limited the ability of EU citizens to express their political opinions, if those opinions are extremist garbage. 

&gt; ...Or do you think we would find a sad little man, who has accomplished little and represents even less, angrily arguing that the solution to a better future is if everyone just did what he said, and we got rid of those pesky democratic rights for all those losers - totally unlike himself, mind! - that vote for the ""wrong"" team? 

Either you're projecting something fierce right now and you're facing serious personal self-esteem issues, or you're a strawmanning moron. No one is for taking away democratic rights. Learn to read. Or go and get a psychiatrist. Or a friend and a beer.

&gt; Eugenics. The notion that we discriminate based on the ""inferiority"" of a person leads to only one outcome - to justifying and even demanding eugenics. 

Where the bloody hell did you pull eugenics from? 

&gt; You should consider yourself lucky to live in a free society.  

I don't live in a free society because of luck, I live in a free society because my parents stood against a tyrannical government led by a political ideology that brings oppression and death. I live in a free society because my predecessors actually are willing to stand up against criminal dogmas.

2060,"He did push the envelope on 3 separate occasions. When I say ""he"", it would be more accurate to say his team, but he was nevertheless the one with the vision and the one doing the pushing. These 3 things he did where:

- Taking the original concept of Desktop Computing found on the Xerox Alto and Xerox Star, machines that costed as much a house, and distilling it down to a point where it would work on a machine that was within reach of mere mortals, called the Macintosh.

- Creating one of the best workstations ever, called the NeXT, with one of the most user-friendly versions of Unix ever made (at the time) called NextStep/OpenStep. NextStep would later receive a fresh coat of paint, and be rebranded OSX, the OS which still powers Macs to this day, and from which iOS is derived. Which is why when you code for OSX or iOS, you'll come across all sorts of things such as *nstimer* or *nsdictionary*: the NS stands for NextStep.

- Having the bright idea of putting a capacitive touch screen on a mobile device (the original iPhone was the first to do it), and having the foresight to build the entire usage experience of the device around it. This decision was a clean break from everything other smartphones available at the time where doing, which where mostly powered by Windows Phone 6.5, and pretty much required a stylus to use. The original iPhone simply swept all of those aside: It made every other Smartphone available on the market completely obsolete, so much so that nowadays few people either remember or even know that at one time, the smartphone market was dominated by Windows Phone.

This doesn't mean there isn't a substantial and undeserved cult around Steve Jobs. There have been other people who where way more influential to the computing industry as a whole, and who's passing was given at best a footnote of cover by some news organizations, if at all.

It's not a comparison. It's just a common phrase for when you support both sides in [enter pretty much anything with sides]. Like when you say someone hit the nail on the head, you're not actually comparing him with a carpenter. 

&gt;He most probably gave money in exchange for influence in concrete areas and topics, rather than supporting the parties unconditionally. A way to assure himself a win-win.

But he's an independent, why would he have to support the parties unconditionally? In the USA, especially as a candidate, it's a lot more helpful to look at the candidates than their parties. Political parties in the USA function very differently than in Europe. They're much less uniform in terms of ideology and often more a vehicle to be competitive in an election.

Yea, look at that world map, most of those countries are Muslim majority or crappy African countries. Compare the percentage of Christian majority vs Muslim majority when it comes to gay rights and it will be quite obvious. Plus I'm not too excited about the prospect of Ugandan immigration either, for the same reasons.

&gt; No, you are lying to yourself think christianty wasn't the exact same way 100 years ago in the west and still is all over the world. You are simply ignoring history.

We don't live 100 years ago.

&gt;Again, you are just ignoring facts. ETA alone has way more casualties than all Muslim terror attacks combined. 

I bet that makes parents of kids blown up at Ariana Grande concert or massacred at Bataclan feel so much better. ETA is gone, jihadist terrorism is still here. 

&gt;And you're right, all non muslim emmigrants just get intergrated no problem.

It's a matter of degrees.

&gt;random bible quotes

Nobody actually believes and practices that stuff, certainly not in Europe. Meanwhile homosexuality is ACTUALLY illegal in virtually every Muslim country. Women are ACTUALLY required to wear veil in many.

If Europe's Christians lived according to old testament scripture you might have a point, but they don't. They reformed their religion long ago. Islam cannot be reformed because they believe that it's the literal word of the creator of the universe. 

It's fascinating how you're willing to split hairs to condemn every little thing that is wrong with the west but you'll completely ignore things that are 100 times worse in the Muslim world. 

&gt;but descriminating based on what some muslim thinks/thought is just as stupid as descriminating based on what christian europeans thought in the past and what many still believe.

2230,"&gt;What makes you think there is now suddenly some chance of ""extending the agreement""? 

Because that would be the only valid and logical reason. If you have blocked this agreement without a bit of initiative to improve it you are a senile (referring to Di Maio). But I think that is the reason. Coldiretti, the largest association representing and assisting Italian agriculture, is also moving.  


&gt;If Canada now needs to protect all Italian GIs, what do you suggest the EU give Canada to rebalance the deal?

To protect their products as we do with ours.

&gt; I think the fair thing would be that the EU protects EU GIs in the EU, not try to force others to change well established names in their countries.

&gt;Italians, and other EU producers, have the right to use the EU GI logo, which should be protected, and they can add their own labels like in Italian wines. 

This, if done well, could be a good and perfect initiative.

The only country that recognized Tibet's independence from China at the time was Mongolia, who later dropped it when the CCP won the Civil War in 1949. How shamelessly hypocritical that the US only started caring about ""Tibetans"" when the side they funded in the Chinese Civil War lost, so the CIA started funding Tibetan separatism.

2277,"While the surface component that the US Navy will begin to deploy before 2030 takes shape, with various programmes for new platforms (including the one for the FFG/X frigates to which Fincantieri is also partecipating with the FREMM), Washington has choosen the next generation anti-ship missile. The missile that will replace the HARPOON, developed in the 70s and still in service in progressevly upgraded versions, will be the NAVAL STRIKE MISSILE (NSM) system of the norwegian Kongaberg, selected on the basis of a custumised proposal made together with Raytheon. The 1st of june the Navy Department has choosen the norwegian missile, prefering it to the proposals made by Boeing (which partecipated with a further upgraded version of the HARPOON-Extend Range), and by Lockheed Martin, wich proposed the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile project. A 15 million dollars contract forsees for now the custumisation of the missile and the realisation of a pre-series batch, and it should be followed by a first production contract, of the estimated value of 848 million. At the moment is expected the adoption of the Kongsberg/Raytheon missile on the LCSs – some tests have been made onboard the USS COLORADO – and on the future FFG/X frigates; indeed, this victory of the norwegian industry underscores how the US Navy is looking with interest to the euroupean products, in order to eliminate the gaps created, especially with China.

&gt;""We have already reached shame that Jews are ruling Russia, that everywhere representatives of this people have come toforefront, that only Jews are happy and triumphant, while all Russia is exhausted under the yoke of unbearable suffering ... Having seized all power in their hands, disposed of as at home, the property, honor and interests of Russia, ministers. Russian people are heavy on their rise and are swinging for a long time until they rise to their full height and remember their duty to defend their Motherland from Jew dominance "".

Ivan Rodionov, сolonel of the White Army, writer:
&gt;The enemy of the whole Russian people, moreover, is an enemy bloodthirsty, irreconcilable, sneaky, with no stopping at all - a withered Jew. And know that this enemy is terribly dangerous and the most powerful, because it acts not by its power, which it does not have, but by the forces of other peoples, skillfully using their stupidity, greed and short-sightedness ... Therefore, with the Jews there must be a ruthless struggle, to **extermination** . From now on we can not live together with a Jew in our native Russia: either they, or we, can not be another solution to the question

2328,"It depends on the objective. Like in Iraq and Afghanistan the objective wasn't to control the whole country but to control key objectives it was cheaper and likely more effective to do it this way considering that Afghanistan and Iraq are very hard to traverse. That favours the enemy however as they can travel between your outposts with ease.

If the objective is to annex an entire country then yea you do really need to form a ""front line"". In WW2 there was a superficial front line on maps but in reality it never existed because the Easter Front was simply too large to control. Instead it was a form of units and outposts all along the line in key geographical locations where the enemy was expected to cross. It meant that surrounding units without them knowing was possible and it did happen frequently. Whole entire armies where surrounded and destroyed this way.

In a modern form of warfare if we where to fight by controlling towns and cities the units garrisoning them would be surrounded by higher numbers then them and destroyed entirely. It wouldn't be difficult at all. That's if you where going up against an equally strong country. If you know where you enemy is because they are in control of a town, village or outpost you can simply use overwhelming artillery, missiles, airstrikes and so on. Then go in an finish off the job with mechanised infantry. You can see how this would happen in Ukraine at the moment, it has reverted back into trench warfare with a defined front line. 

If either side advances it is destroyed easily because it's now visible. If you are in a trench you are no longer visible so you can't be targeted. Your trenches can be targeted but you might not be in that part of the trench at that point in time.

On the other hand it's not like WW1 where a tank can be used as cover to initiate an attack because anti-tank weapons are extremely effective these days. It's a stalemate and it likely won't change much for years unless a political resolution can be found.

If our military had the capability of forming defined front lines then it depends on the warfare they want to commit to, is it necessary to achieve the objective they have been given. If they had the capability in Iraq and Afghanistan no I doubt they would but in a hypothetical war against Russia or any other country with a modern military where the objective is to take the country then yes it 100% would be necessary to form a front line and advance from there. Like I said you can see this with Ukraine, the objective for both sides is they want to take over the country for themselves to some point or at least take more land not to find and kill a guerrilla militia.

Regarding the second link, I speak german quite fluently, so that isn't an issue. Bojma Cavoglave isn't ""an ustasha hymn"". It was written in the nineties, and the only link with ustasha is that it uses a chant za dom spremni which ustasha ruined. Before them it was croatian chant since Josip Jelacic in form of za dom spremni umrijeti (ready to die for home). However, the song itself has nothing to do with ustasha and only the intro chant is problematic, which they didn't sing.

Australia maybe be a regional power because most oceanic nations are small in area and population by default, but how can we seriously think of Russia as global power).

I do remember reading an article years ago about Russian eastern regions being resource rich but population poor, while being right next to China which is (relative to its population) resource poor and population rich, which may lead to conflict if China chose to take Russian eastern resource regions in war instead of trade.

I personally don't think that is likely, as they are both nuclear armed states, and I've never read anything about tension between the nations.

2519,"&gt;However I was very suprised by the video because I thought this was a recent trend, and also because of how ridiculous and fear-mongering the newspiece is...

The example I like bringing up with how far US networks go is from the Munich shooting in 2016. [Check this report](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2016/07/22/germany-munich-witness-gunman-loading-pistol.cnn/video/playlists/munich-shopping-center-shooting/), more specifically the video that's 3:08 long.

Their ""German speaking producer"" found a ""witness"" by ""calling different stores in the area"" and reached this particular one while she was ""hiding in a windowless store right next door to the McDonalds"".

&gt;Now Lauretta told us this, that she was in the McDonalds when a gunman came out of a bathroom and started firing, she said she was only 2cm away from him, she said his back was turned to her or she believes she would be dead right now. She says her eight year old son was in the bathroom with him and saw him loading his gun.

&gt;[...] ""I hear Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. This I know because I'm muslim too. I hear this and only crying.""

CNN protected the identity of this ""witness"" so well that it was the only eyewitness account who ever reported hearing anything like this. Reddit live threads were filled with ""Muslim terrorist, CNN said so!!"" - turns out not even fake witnesses are an issue.

As far as I know this was never corrected, the people all still work there and - as you can see - videos mentioning this are still easily available 2 years later.

...and at the same time FOX reported that the gunman was a right-wing extremist with a similar level of information.

While the Fox-version turned out [closer to reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Munich_shooting#Perpetrator) that was all just speculation in the hours after the attack - US 24/7 news shows have absolutely zero issue exploiting these kinds of things.

HSV is an interesting stat, but usually not a severe issue. I had already posted the HIV number, more in fact. The HPV vaccine also decreases cervical cancer, as the two are connected. To all this I'll add where Dr. discusses [STI’s and how benefits from circumcision are overshadowed by behavioural factors.](https://youtu.be/XwZiQyFaAs0?t=59m44s)

STIs are about the best argument for circumcision, but it's not effective prevention so people still need to use condoms. We should choose less invasive options like sex education, cheap/free condoms, clean needle programs, etc. Let's keep in mind that circumcision involves removing a body part, it's not free so to speak. Where is the logic in removing a body part and then turning around and saying, 'Surprise you can't rely on that so you must use a condom and practice safe sex *exactly the same* as if we didn't remove that organ, meaning the circumcision was unnecessary'.

And this is all beside the point that STI’s are not relevant for newborns or children. They are not having sex. If an adult or young adult wants the HIV and STI benefits from circumcision they can choose it for themselves. You can make an argument that it should be available younger than the standard 18, but this is still not an argument for newborn circumcision. 

Talks of bans are for newborns and children only. Adults can choose for themselves.

As for harm, we know that the foreskin is [the most sensitive part of the penis.]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) Full study [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847).

In response to your edit: Crucially that's a decision I will make, it's not in anyone else's jurisdiction. And it's really not effective. Wear a condom and it's vastly more effective. Or should I say, actually effective.

2609,"&gt;Moscow is an aggressor 

The only (well, almost) reason for that is advancement of NATO, which is the military organization with only 1 purpose, which is to be anti-Russian. 

People in Europe don't understand Russian mindset. It is very simple. For Russia security is a number one issue and it always was for a reason. Russia sees that NATO was in West Germany and now it is already in some countries, that were part of USSR. At some point Russia decided that, no matter the cost, it just can't allow NATO to make any step closer to it's borders and surrender USSR and Russian bases to NATO.

The problem with EU is that EU basically equals NATO now. So advancement of EU is no different from advancement of NATO itself from Russian point of view. If EU separates from NATO it might be a different story.

&gt;Its ambitions to recreate a Russian 'Near Abroad' and recover its Imperial and (subsequently) Soviet spheres of influence are directly inimical to E.U interests, and always will be. 

If EU really wants to admit Ukraine and Belarus as EU members than yes, hostility is inevitable. But is it a really a vital interest for EU to take them as EU members? EU struggles with Brexit and has a lot of problems with numerous EU countries inside it's borders, do they really need Ukraine on top of that? Is expansion in that direction a real priority? Do they really want to fight with Russia because of that? Is the prize worth the fight? It does not make too much sense to me.

&gt;Damage Russia, and restrict its ambitions to return Eastern European states to its sphere of influence ... **then**, you can negotiate with Russia as an equal, 

So you want to take the most crucial for Russia post soviet countries first. Basically you want to make Russia capitulate and then have negotiations. It's just not going to happen. You will basically need to engage in a fight until only one remains in the end. 

And Russia is no threat to countries that are already in EU, it just does not have economic power to control them and, of course, it is not going to ""conquer"" them militarily for multiple reasons.

I don't see why EU should engage in bloody fight with Russia for post soviet Russian speaking countries. Especially when it has so many other interesting things to do.

Drugs are illegal because we had FREE and fair elections to elect officials to vote on the matter. In 1939 we conscripter men into the army to defend our independancy and freedom, but do tell me what is worse, to conscript men into the army and take their freedom away temporarely, or be integrated into a authotarian dictatorship? We migh live in a nanny state but you know what, its the best that we've got. I like to think myself as a realist and the thing is that I do not see a practical solution that is better than having countries with legal institutions and constitutions than we have now. But I do want to know what would be a better and more realistic world according to you, since its too easy if you can just shit on my ideals without letting me do the same for you, since isnt that what freedom is? 

Ok, you dont seem to understand the hair rule in the FDF. Firstly it should be kept short since once it get wet, muddy, tangled ect. as long hair does it will get into really bad state and youll have to cut it eventually. Now the thing is that the army doesnt have a clear cut black line for how short that hair should be for EITHER gender. All that it must be is neat and or combed and clean looking. Shortly said the hair should not go bellow your neck hairline or your ears. Here are some examples, https://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/201611242200031661_uu.shtml 

What I mean with honest is that of someone finds my wallet, their first thought is mostlikely to return it, not to keep it. If I ask someones opinion about a matter, they will speak freely on the matter and they wont lie. There is a reason why trust based systems seem to work just fine in Finland, but not in many others. But never the less, I dont see how your opinion on my country men means much since you seem to think that your opinions are facts. Sure everyone is selfish in their hearts, but at least in here the society in general is driven to be less so and I fail to see how your dream country could be better in this category. 

I spoke of my language and how I feel about it. How logical it is or how easy it is to learn is irrelevant. 

It seems quite cute how how you think that im owned by my government. Those people are more interested in keeping themselves in office rather than wondering how they can make me a willing slave. In all honesty ive heard this argument many times and frankly you seem to have a very limited view on the world is and functions outside the 3 youtubers that you've probably taken these ideas from.

The gist of it is that if you want to have your fancy smartphone and a nice and comfy home, we need order and we need a government, thats how its is. Sure we could go full anarchy which seems to be what you want, absolute freedom, but it wouldnt take too many days before someone would raise an army and take all that away from you. So democracy is the best compromise that we have at the moment. Im fully aware that I lose many things like absolute freedom when I live in Finland, but I also get quite a bit in return. So understand one thing, you are just a cog in a machine that is the human built world and you're not as important as you seem to think that you are. But realise that even you do not have freewill and to a degree, all conform to what the society wants or is, no matter how much you think or believe to be above it.

2669,"Hating the head of state is a national sport in France. Brings back fond memories of 1793.

More seriously, Macron's poll numbers are actually pretty good by French standards, and are much better than either Sarkozy or Hollande at this time in their polls. Chirac had a higher approval rating this time into his second term, but that was a different political context.

The fact the French political landscape is _very_ fragmented plays a big role. As per tradition, the French left is divided between various factions, which added together represent between 30 and 40% of the population, and most of them hate Macron, or at least dislike him, mainly on economic issues. The far right is just as anti-Macron if not more, mainly on immigration and european issues, and the mainstream right has a difficult relationship with him. All those people are going to dislike him, for whatever reasons. That still leaves a decently sized support base in the centre and the moderate right, which is still very loyal to him.

Macron's current position is more stable than it might seem, as no other political faction or party can (as of today) pose a serious threat to him. The far left is in a relatively good position, but struggles to appeal outside of its support base and is pretty divided. The moderate left is still in shambles after Hollande's presidency, and is so divided giving an outline of all the current factions would be too long. The mainstream right is on paper the biggest opposition party, but has been in part absorbed by Macron's administration on its left, without progressing on its right. The far right still has it's eternal support base, but is as universally hated by all other political parties as ever, and Le Pen's disastrous 2017 campaign has done nothing to help their situation. Macron may be unpopular, but to most people, he is the ""lesser evil"" of all the countries factions.


Of course, the French political landscape is very unstable and unpredictable. Macron owes his election to a series of plot twists no one could have predicted, and similar events could happen in the near future sending the country's situation in currently unimaginable directions. But, given the context, Macron's position is relatively stable and his unpopularity relatively moderate.

2691,"Muslim expansion wasn't a big a factor as you might think. Muslim aggression was a factor in why the crusades happened but it wasn't the main factor.

The main factor in why it happened was due to pope Urban weak position at the time. He had been involved in a war with Henry V the Holy Roman emperor, and even his predecessors had been at war with Henry's predecessors. Urban was losing and was being threatened, so he called the Crusades. This was an incredibly effective move, as most of Henry's supporters left him. Godfrey of Bouillon was one Henry's most fervent supporters and later became the knights of Jerusalem.

Some argue that it was entirely due to Muslim aggression and that it was because of their violence that the Crusades happened. This is a pretty weak argument. There was no one unified Islamic force, as some like to claim. They were split into different kingdoms themselves and succession was often very messy. Islamic raids happened, but they were raids by bandits who were Muslims. They did kill Christians but the killed Muslims and Jews too. Anyone who went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem would have some money, especially if the travelled far. They didn't pose much of a threat to the byzantine empire, as they were too torn by internal conflicts. That did change though.

The byzantine emperor Alexius Comnenus did ask urban fir assistance, but this was several years before Urban called for the Crusades. Alexius called for it as he had recently became emperor after overthrowing the previous emperor who overthrew the previous one. This infighting had severely weakened them. Ironically, it was not the Muslims who took advantage of this, but their own fellow Christians. Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemond of Taranto, later a crusader, actually invaded the byzantine empire and captured land. Bohemond even continued to attack Alexius after he became prince of Antioch.

The invasion by the Moors in Spain is often used as another reason as to why the Crusades were called. However, at when the Crusades were called, the Moors were being pushed back and their kingdom in Spain had recently been split up into smaller ones due to infighting. Moreover, if the Crusades happened due to Moorish actions in Spain, why wasn't the Crusade called to help them.

The argument used for this is that Jerusalem held greater importance and that Christians and Jews were being persecuted. It's important to note that they did have this harder than Muslims, but this was not unusual. The religion in power always had greater benefits. The Christians who were being attacked were being attacked by bandits which always a concern. There was nothing new in this. The argument that it happened to help the jews is the weakest one I've heard, as the peoples Crusade was responsible for the Rhineland massacre often called the first holocaust.

Taking all this into account, we can see that it wasn't really due to Muslim aggression. There was no increase in aggression, everything was the same as it was been. People of all religions and cultures tried to fuck each other over to gain more power. This was the reason why the Crusades happened. Urban was screwed and so he called or and saved his skin.

Religion was used as a political tool to further his own position. Bohemond did the same. He could advance no further in Italy, so looked to the middle east. Zengi did the same. He took advantage of the chaos to advance his own lands. His son Nur ad-Din did the same as did Saladin. It was less a war of religion and more of a war between various different people who wished to use religion as an excuse to advance their own position.

2700,"&gt;You immediately made assumptions about hypothetical persons that you don't know: they won't pay it back, they are not good students

It honestly seems to me like you didn't read what I wrote. So for the sake of a good discussion let me paste what I said above:

&amp;nbsp;

A. ""and nobody wants to lend them money because they tend not to pay it back ""



I didn't say they wouldn't pay back, I said they can't find anyone to lend them money (because they think they won't pay back). Not the same thing, don't take my words out of context.

&amp;nbsp;

B. (You made an assumption that)""they are not good students""

I said this because in the comment above I said there should be subsidies for good students here

""and preferentially good students (whether in a career of high demand or otherwise)""

So this wasn't me making assumptions, but you failing to read what I wrote to you. If you are genuinely interested in having a discussion (which I doubt), don't do this.

&amp;nbsp;

C. Furthermore, you assume that only things that the market has demand for are worthy of financial support

No, I said the opposite if you read my comment again. ""While it is true that an educated population has externalities upon those that don't even go to university, from my degree in economics I know this is not above the 20% mark of the cost of education""

This means that not only what the market demands should be supported financially, but the financial support given to things the market does not demand should be justified by seeing what additional benefits it has to society as a whole (These are called externalities in economics).

They were all asked the question within the context of the came made that A50 was final. They correctly stated that it wasn't. Any decision can always be unmade by unanimous agreement of the member states.

They never, not once stated that anything could happen against the express will of the other member states, citing the fact that the extension clause requires a unanimous vote.

Now you tell me smart guy, if a country can just withdraw from Article 50 and then resend it to give them selves an extra 2 years, why would the Article require a unanimous vote to extend negotiations by a mere 6 months? If the intent of the 2 year clause was just to stop the EU from dragging its feet, why isn't the extension solely in the hands of the leaving member?

Your version simply makes no sense. If a country has full control over when they leave there's no point in requiring anyone but them to extend the deadline. Only in the context of all decisions needing approval from all sides does the argument fit.

Also, in your mind, if your fantasy was true and the EU legally had to take the UK back, but told it to fuck off, what exactly would stop us?

2855,"&gt;Yeah, except Poland and the Baltics share high support for the EU as well, despite a very local extremist minority. Hungarians on the 
other hand...

But the point is, if Poland and the Baltics are both pro-U.S as well, then they will be forced to choose in a world where Europe moves towards self-reliance. For the European Union, the choices are twofold. Firstly, incorporate Eastern Europe into the E.U more fully while letting them elect autocratic, illiberal folks like Orban and PiS, poison the well of pan-European discourse and free-ride on Western European prosperity and global connectivity. Secondly, cut them off and consolidate around the European *core*, which runs to the Oder-Neisse line and no further. The former would be both expensive and possibly detrimental to the stability of the EU itself, while the latter would be allowing the United States to position assets, create allies and generate a strategic bulwark on the European continent itself, which would then pose a threat to the European Union's geostrategic position in the event of a Washington-Brussels rivalry. 

&gt;Cutting them off would lead to one thing - the term ""Western betrayal"" becoming ever so popular, as for the US it would cost way too much to invest in a new defensive line east of the supposed WEU, a defensive line that would not offer much in regards to trade. I'll be honest, I would not waste billions of dollars for principle's sake, the Intermarium can hold on it's own...

I'm not sure that the assumption about the U.S holds. In the event of the E.U cutting Eastern Europe off, I'm assuming the U.S will take the lessons learned from NATO and apply them to any new basing arrangements in Eastern Europe - i.e, those countries would have to pay for American protection, maintain significant military assets (at 2.0% or more of GDP) and mainly buy American military assets (thus securing production runs for the American defense industry and effective logistical chains). This would give the United States greater control over those states in Eastern Europe while lowering basing costs relative to those in Western Europe - with the UK acting as an offshore bridghead that would connect North America to Eastern European ports and airfields via the North Sea. As for trade, I'd imagine that trade with the EU would continue even as the geostrategic rivalry intensifies - after all, U.S - China trade continues even as American bases dot the first and second island chains and constrain China's strategic position.

Thing is, just being able to file documents in English is not enough. The laws vary wildly across the continent. Plenty of legal terms are simply untranslatable, so you'd need a guide next to it explain what the terms actually mean.

To actually change this would require actually aligning the entire legal structures and cultures of the individual countries. And in so far this is actually possible, it isn't going to happen.

2890,"I dare to say that today's culture has very little to do with culture of 200 years or more ago.

Languages are especially a great example. They are constantly evolving, absorbing and replacing each another. Not to mention that a few centuries ago, there were a lot more languages or at least dialects which frankly were often so different from each another that today they could be called their own languages if they survived the test of time. A western Slovak would have more difficulties understanding eastern Slovak 100 years ago than s/he would have understanding Moravian Czech of the same period, for example. So much for Slovak and Czech being two different languages while western and eastern Slovak mere dialects of the same language. 

It's already possible to say that we all in here belong to the ""western culture."" 

Cultural dish? Who doesn't enjoy and rather often eat Pizza, for example? And for example, how many times have my fellow Slovaks had national dumplings compared to the abovementioned ""western dish?"" Generally speaking, we, people of the ""western cultural group,"" prefer the same type of food. 

Music? Let's just hop onto any music chart and find differences. The genre is the same and even musicians or song are often the same. Generally, we, people of the ""western cultural group,"" like the same music.

Movies? We watch the same stuff. 

Same goes for fashion. 

Politics are generally the same. Democratic model, separation of 3 powers, the same concept of human rights, the same model of economy.

Sure some individuals within this huge group will differ here and there, but overall there are a lot more similarities than differences. I may be too optimistic but I feel quite certain that if I met with a French, German, Portuguese, American, Romanian or any other member of the western group of comparable age and background, I wouldn't find it much harder to socialize than with other Slovaks or Czechs of comparable age and background.

Canada has had enourmous amounts of immigration, and entire region of it speaks a different language and has had strong seperationist tendencies, very sparse and isolated population, and a very strong representation of native Americans. And they still managed to do what Americans didn't.

There's more to be said about the role of American anti-centralism and how it played into the lack of development of comprehensive federal welfare programs, rather than the weird bias you have for American-centric naratives surrounding racial homogeinity and countries that don't operate on that sort of weird and honestly worrying bias.

And there's the rub, I'm afraid. I don't think the way things have gone that even if the UK bows out of Brexit successfully, the Leavers have been reduced in numbers nearly enough for us to be even cautiously optimistic about that. They'll vote the next opportunist willing to pluck those strings into number 10, odds are on the promise of mailing in an article 50 letter, written and well publicised on the campaign trail weeks in advance, that same day.

Regardless making this kind of assessment requires that the revoking of the article 50 submission cannot be done unilaterally by the UK. Not even once, since as a nation they operate under common law, which is precedent based, and its public by and large would refuse to understand why if it could be done once before, it couldn't be done a second time.

It is mindbogling that people still believe that several nations in europe just decided out of nowhere to send kings, men etc. to cross whole world (back then) to reclaim piece of land.

It is probably after ""dark ages"" most incorrect myth.

It is like history didn't exist before that event.

Crussade was stupid idea (from military tactical point of view) but it was not ""unprovoked"". At the time Muslims were rapidly expanding and basically were breathing around europe southern border swallowing more and more ""christian"" nations and with Islam ""either you convert or pay stupid as fuck taxes"" they basically made removed cultures. Whole idea was proposed shortly after muslims literally almost sacked rome (they sacked most of the city but papal core was defended) which was just another big NO-NO of faith world after taking Constantinople and sacking Jerusalem 100s years earlier and destroying original mound of Jesus. People could forgive slaughter of ""infidels"" and slavery that was ongoing since very start as it was mostly ruling powers powerplay but taking basically every tangible facet of christiandom was not something they could tolerate anymore.

Basically at the time Christiandom was like alliance, they were allowed to fuck with eatch other and had Pope as mediator but everyone outside was asking for trouble picking fights with members. And out of 5 most important holy sites of Christiandom were lost to Muslims via conquer 3 were in hands of muslims and nearly lost 4th. When muslims started to really cause problems to southern europe nations and attacked rome nearly destroying papal state then they decided enough is enough and they will plow muslims.

While territory wise and considering main goal crusades were failure they basically stopped Muslim expansion, instead of developing power muslims had to defend in their core on other hand while crusades were costly in absolute therm they weren't that costly as in that time Europe didn't fought war on their lands with muslims. War on their lands was very expensive and even after crusades they paid price for it.

AS per usual in that time the biggest winner was disease, most of people who went to crusades didn't die in combat but just disease. Same reason why Europeans didn't colonize africa till recently as Europeans didn't have immunity to hot climate diseases.

3210,"right wing = likes money, usually in a libertarian sense where they believe that income inequalities are fine as people earned their wealth but defending aristocracy's money they exactly didn't work for was certainly right wing too though hasn't been too relevant in a while now

left wing = theoretically wants to spread money equally

far left = actually what it says on the tin, though most far left movements (that got in power) are authoritarian too which isn't exactly what leftism says on the tin. Communists do count as far left, and KPRF is the second largest party in Russia and don't agree with Putin too much.

far right = hell if I know but certainly not defending libertarian capitalism and not too far on the fiscal right. Usually conservatives of some sort, usually want some control over the economy but possibilities range from crony capitalism to partially nationalised one, and a sort of command economy is employed though pushing for equality or too much wealth redistribution is usually not included so we can't exactly call it leftist either. Usually they don't like people of other colours or religions and are conservative but even that goes out of the window, plenty of Nazis (pretty much definitive far right) wanted to get rid of many traditional German and European values so they aren't conservative, plenty of Italian fascists (maybe the OG far right) including the leadership until they started bowing towards Berlin were pretty cool with Africans etc. Unifying features would be authoritarianism and nationalism, with fascists proper also including glorification of history, war and violence. Liking religion is optional.

Putin = an authoritarian nationalist irredentist asshole, not left, could be argued to be on the far right in the sense Le Pen or Trump but certainly not in the sense of Hitler or Mussolini. Wants to take places that are in some sense Russian

Hitler = a dictatorial genocidal fascist expansionist asshole, and a very radical person even for far right, adding a good layer of racism and genocide in the mix, wants to take places in order to kill the Slavs there and make the lands German instead

Finally, the rules will not be bent. It's not that the major players can't, they won't. The EU will live on without the UK. It will not live on if it's basic framework are undermined. The core members will not risk their project to keep a relative newcomer with one leg constantly out the door.

Oh, was Poland majority German as well? Did inhabitants of Poland at the time *want* to be German citizens? I don't even understand what your argument is supposed to be here - how does the fact that the newly formed Republic of Lithuania happened to *claim* a certain area automatically made it 'theirs'? If for some reason the Republic of Lithuania decided to claim Vladivostok and San Francisco as well, should all the other claimants to those cities proclaim that ""oh well, the Republic of Lithuania claimed it, I guess the game is over, it's theirs now!"", and hereby withdraw all their claims to those cities?

&gt; never annexed Czechoslovakian land

We indeed did - in 1938. In 1919, it was Czechoslovakia which invaded and annexed Polish lands, not the other way around.

&gt;never annexed Ukrainian, Belarusian or Lithuanian land.

There were no internationally recognized borders of 'Poland', 'Ukraine', 'Belarus' and 'Lithuania' in the area of former Russian Empire in the period immediately after WW1. The city of *Vilna* was *claimed* by Republic of Lithuania, and it was also exactly as much *claimed* by Republic of Poland. The claim of the Republic of Poland was obviously stronger, even though the Bolsheviks interfered with it several times, going to such lenghts as to giving the city to the Republic of Lithuania after taking it from the Republic of Poland.

The city of *Leopolis* was claimed by the Republic of Poland, Ukrainian People's Republic and Ukrainian Soviet Republic. All of the countries involved had quite strong arguments - the city both culturally and historically was indubitably Polish, but the area around it was ethnically mixed in the style of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and there were significant Ukrainian presence, especially on the countryside.

At the time of the 1917 Revolution, the Russian Orthodox Church was deeply integrated into the autocratic state, enjoying official status. This was a significant factor that contributed to the Bolshevik attitude to religion and the steps they took to control it.[1] Thus the USSR became the first state to have as one objective of its official ideology the elimination of existing religion, and the prevention of future implanting of religious belief, with the goal of establishing state atheism (gosateizm).[2][3][4][5] Under the doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union, there was a ""government-sponsored program of conversion to atheism"" conducted by Communists.[6][7][8] The communist regime targeted religions based on State interests, and while most organized religions were never outlawed, religious property was confiscated, believers were harassed, and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools.[2] In 1925 the government founded the League of Militant Atheists to intensify the persecution.[9] Accordingly, although personal expressions of religious faith were not explicitly banned, a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the official structures and mass media and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain professions (teachers, state bureaucrats, soldiers) to be openly religious.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8z0wej/europe_is_the_new_big_thing_while_america_is_the/e2f7gvz/,vokegaf,1531652937

3361,"&gt; Again, flawed argument. Because there is a dangerous legal thing that does not mean other should be also legal.

But alcohol kills people.


Tobacco kills people



Cannabis does not.


Flawed argument my ass.



You are assuming cannabis IS dangerous.


This is based on your own ignorance.


What keeps you from accepting reality????


&gt;You cherrypick negative effects of alcohol.

lol wtf???


Do you work for a beer distributor. I don't work for a cannabis distributor, but I can still see that cannabis should be legal before alcohol.



The point is that you can not have alcohol and tobacco legal while keeping cannabis illegal.


So, you need to come out for the prohibition of alcohol and tobacco, or you better allow the least harmful of the three, cannabis.


I cannot make you less ignorant, you have to accept reality  by yourself.

&gt;In US, Deaths from, annually:

&gt;Alcohol - 90K - legal in Europe

&gt;Tobacco - 300K+ - legal in Europe

&gt;Cannabis - 0 

What do you fail to realize here?



You are against the least harmful substance. That makes no sense whatsoever.



In 10 years I hope you remember this exchange, because you are never going to be on the right side of history on this one until you accept the basic reality.




Alcohol is more harmful than cannabis


Tobacco is more harmful than cannabis.




And you are against he legalization of the least harmful of the three????



You are wrong.


You are wrong based on your own ignorance.

Not all of those. I do criticize people like ""genres"" because that's the most ridiculous thing ever and those things are so arbitrarily delimited and if someone likes a ""genre"" they just want to belong with some group. ""sexual orientation""  might as well be an admission of ""I am easily brainwashed by society""; humans have no ""sexual orientation"" on their own; they only get one when they grow up in a culture that glorifies that concept; it's really much like ""genres"" and just a way to self-identify as a member of some stupid little group, putting yourself in a box and then limiting yourself by it.

""religions"" are yet again meaningless self-identified tirbalist labels and with pretty much any religion nowadays the test whether you belong to it is again meaningless self-identification because what the religion supposedly stands for has been redefined a thousand times through history and it's really more a community thing than people actually believing the fairy tales in holy books and the moral imperatives and each of them selectively decides which of them they pick.

edit: brand loyalty more often than not is also just biased garbage: in practice one brand comes with good and bad products and people who claim they like a ""brand"" opposed to an individual product 99% of the time are just biased fanboys but it's in theory possible that a brand only produces good stuff but it's pretty rare.

&gt; Or are people liking their country somehow distinct to you and it is them that you prey on?

The major gripe I have with people liking countries is that no country is worth liking and in practice it also just stems from bias since people magically happen to end up liking the country they grew up in—what are the odds.

It's just people being successfully brainwashed by the patriotism propaganda of that they must like their country; it speaks of a weak mind.",Dat is allemaal helemaal niet nodig hoor.,/r/europe/comments/8z02ig/finnish_honesty/e2f4t1f/,Homoerotic_Theocracy,1531646803

U/Marcomancer pointed out that favourable tax rates weren’t the only reason for companies to set up shop in Ireland. You disagreed.

This implicitly means that you think that without favourable tax rates, Ireland would have nothing going for it.

Then you say that Ireland should happily harmonise its tax rates with the rest of Europe. If you think this should be done, and if you think Ireland has nothing else going for it, then...

...isn’t it **you** who proposes a beggar-thy-neighbour policy? Isn’t it **you** who believes their country can only prosper more if Ireland prospers less? And in such a case, why on earth should Ireland cooperate with that? 

The EU was set up with every nation having competence to set its own tax policy. This was agreed to by every - EVERY - EU member state. Ireland, and every other member state, agreed to the Lisbon Treaty, not some hypothetical treaty you wish was now in effect. And the **reason** we all signed this treaty was because we all saw it as beneficial to ourselves. Your country, whichever one it is, signed it not because you were tricked but because you saw profit in it. And you HAVE profited from it. If Ireland is profiting more, don’t begrudge us that.

Now, I’ll agree that the Apple case seems to be an example of governmental favouritism and if so, then the Irish government was wrong to do that. That should be rectified. But the Irish government is NOT wrong to set our tax rates at a level that attracts international investment.

Ireland is not always the winner of a race to the bottom. Many Eastern Europeans moved to Ireland over the past couple of decades since their EU membership and in industries such as construction they undercut Irish builders’s prices. Over in r/ireland, we’ve been joking around with r/croatia in a circlejerk about how much we like each other and they mentioned that in Croatia they have a song about how it’s great to emigrate to Ireland. We could be upset at “economic tourism”, but are we? No. That’s just how the EU works. I myself got laid off over a decade ago when the factory I worked in decided it would be cheaper to operate in Poland. Then I got a job at another factory and promptly got laid off again when THAT company decided to move to Poland. Ireland can’t hold that against Poland, though, because that’s exactly the kind of competitive marketplace we signed up to when we joined the common market. Now Ireland has figured out its own way to compete and you want to pull the rug out from under us.

I say: if you want us to cooperate with that, make us an offer.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/8yk6lv/european_countries_ranked_by_gdp_ppp_per_capita/e2f0rl5/,LeoBravo,1531638316

3591,"Well the legalize is kinda murky. UK will get punted out after 2 years, if agreement is not reached. Also there is possibility everybody agrees to negotiation extension.

Key here being said agreement. The Articles put pretty much zero limit on that pursuant ofcourse terms don't violate TEU.

One possibility thrown around is UK and EU agreeing on UK's separation deal being **take backsies, we aren't leaving at all**. This being pursuant of agreement from all EU members, EP and UK.

As far as I understand there is no direct way for UK to unilaterally declare take backsies. That is the severity of Article 50. If you trigger it, to get back out you need all negotiating sides agreeing on that.

All of this is rather *we agree, what goes, goes*, because A50 has never been used before and as said rather vague on specifics. Mostly it deals with timetable and who has to agree on a deal. So one can fudge a truck through that Article as long as everybody agrees, that we can drive a truck through. It is all matter of agreement.

And all EU officials have indicated to UK, *just raise hand and say ""take backsies"" and we do our earnest to figure out technicalities*.

What is mostly preventing take backsies is UK political leadership losing face on that. UK Parliament would have to turn over their previous decision to A50 and go against the advisory referendum. The referendum wasn't legally binding, but there might be political consequences. 

Referendums in general usually don't have such power due to Parliamentary supremity and independence in parliamentary systems. Only thing that could bind Parliaments legislative power to referendum is Parliament explicitly deciding to bind itself. Meaning Parliament makes legislative decision saying *on this matter we delegate the vote to referendum*. Otherwise the referendum is always advisory, due to Parliament being supreme and independent legislative body.

For example: EU law. EU law has power over Parliament due to Parliament years ago legislating, that TEU has power in UK.

Did prohibition in USA reduce the use of alcohol, let alone get rid of it? 

Use of weed amongst minors for example did not go up in Colorado after legalizing recreational pot.

The problem is that you can make the *unhealthy* argument to at least 1 individual for so many things that we'd run out of things to criminalize.

How about unhealthy food for example? This list is fucking endless. 

Bacon is undeniably unhealthy, better yet its production is disasterous for the enviroment.

https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/01/bacon-cancer-processed-meats-nitrates-nitrites-sausages

&gt;**The source of the story was an announcement from the World Health Organization that “processed meats” were now classified as a group 1 carcinogen, meaning scientists were certain that there was “sufficient” evidence that they caused cancer, particularly colon cancer. The warning applied not just to British bacon but to Italian salami, Spanish chorizo, German bratwurst and myriad other foods.**

http://time.com/4657475/bacon-processed-meat-nutrition/

&gt;**Bacon and other smoked, cured and processed meats are usually treated with nitrates or nitrites—chemical added to preserve shelf life and enhance color. Diets high in processed meats have been linked to chronic health conditions including migraines, asthma, heart failure, kidney disease and several types of cancer.**

https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5691902

&gt;**There are estimates that the meat industry produces almost one-fifth of the man-made greenhouse gas emissions that accelerate climate change. Cows are one of the largest producers of methane(through their digestive process), a gas that helps contribute to global warming.**

So its not just damaging to the individual, but the enviroment aswell. Yet you can eat as many bacon hamburgers as you like.

In fact anyone can eat bacon with no restrictions whatsoever. Even alcohol has restrictions, including that you cannot buy it from stores past 9pm in Finland, bacon has absolutely none. 

Worst of all, it doesn't even have an age restriction. Kids eat it, and kids also eat loads of other garbage they shouldn't. Kids are becoming more and more obese and they are dying mentally and physically, but the problem is a 25 year old hippie smoking a blunt in his apartment because you know. 

For example, currently 1 serving of yogur can contain the daily added sugar recommendation for children. Cereal is another one that contains shit ton of it. Fruit juice can contain as much, **if not more**, sugar than coca cola per 100ml, common number being over 10g/100ml, so in a 1l bottle of orange juice you can have easily over 100g of sugar.

The daily recommendation of added sugar, for *adult males* is 9 teaspoons, or 36 grams a day, as recommended by the AHA, the American Heart Association.

https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-sugar-per-day#section3

&gt;**According to the American Heart Association (AHA), the maximum amount of added sugars you should eat in a day are:**

&gt;**Men: 150 calories per day (37.5 grams or 9 teaspoons) **

&gt;**Women: 100 calories per day (25 grams or 6 teaspoons)**

Do you realize what that means in simple terms? One can of orange juice can easily have 4x as much added sugar than adult women should eat in a day. Yet children can drink them with no restriction whatsoever. 2 cans a day? Sure, why not. Costs maybe 2,50€ combined buying the cheap brands. 

The negative health effects of added sugar, you ask?

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-sweet-danger-of-sugar

&gt;""Basically, the higher the intake of added sugar, the higher the risk for heart disease,"" says Dr. Hu.

&gt;""The effects of added sugar intake — higher blood pressure, inflammation, weight gain, diabetes, and fatty liver disease — are all linked to an increased risk for heart attack and stroke,"" says Dr. Hu.

The list is endless. Its not the fat in avocado that is killing people, its the added sugar that is in over 60% of the pre-made shit sold in grocery stores.

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/upshot/it-isnt-easy-to-figure-out-which-foods-contain-sugar.html

&gt;**A team of researchers at the University of North Carolina conducted a detailed survey of the packaged foods and drinks that are purchased in American grocery stores and found that 60 percent of them include some form of added sugar. When they looked at every individual processed food in the store, 68 percent had added sugar. Some of those products are more obvious sugary foods, but not all. The list includes many sauces, soups, fruit juices and even meat products.**

When drugs are legalised then the first thing that happens is an increase in demand, which has the tendency to first and foremost push the supply and thus trafficking of drugs. And even if the local industry catches up this is no guarantee that criminals don't profit, because they can usually undercut the legal business in a thriving black market.

&gt;And that is why it is made up nonsense.  I thought you said there were rational reasons to believe that a god exists?  

No, it's not. When replying I hoped that this would not be your reaction, but I was afraid that it would. What I'm trying to say is that you need to take a broader perspective, to think outside of everything being pure reason for once. And there are. 


&gt;Sorry that isn't how it works, you claim that there you claim that there are rational arguments that a god exists it is up to you to provide them.  It should be easy as you seem so confident.  As for examples of  'unsuccessful' ones that I know of, I've heard them all.  

Well, I'm sorry too, but that is definitely how it works. You make a claim that I might ask you to back up, and I was merely inquiring about your knowledge or experience on the subject. Just out of curiosity, because you asserted that there isn't any rational argument. All I'm trying to do is point you to the legitimacy of different perspectives, I'm not really willing to make a long argument for the rationality of religion here and now, plenty of people much more able have done that before me and you can go and read or listen to those first. One thing you could think of is morality. I think, for example, that there are very (if any) few ways for morals to exist as an absolute truth, without God. But again, you can learn much more about this elsewhere.

&gt;Theism is not as plausible a belief system as atheism, atheism isn't a belief system at all, and theism isn't plausible at all.  With regard to the existence of gods atheism in fact does have a monopoly on being reasonable.

Ah, I see. Again, if I may ask, where did you get this from? I suppose, especially as it's not a belief system according to you, your atheism is based on something big? And how is trusting science and human reason for everything not a belief? I don't think that's right.  

&gt;So you more or less admit that belief in gods is not reasonable?  

No, I did not at all. You really need to read my comments with some nuance and stop seeing everything as either-or, in black and white.
 
&gt;You've made several replies to me, and you have asserted over and over that theism is reasonable, that there is evidence for theism, that theism is a rational belief, yet in all those posts your main focus has been trying to pry out of me why I think unevidenced belief in magical, invisible, superpowered beings is unreasonable, why not simply provide the evidence, provide the rational argument?  The debate will then be over, and you will have won a convert.  Please excuse me if I don't hold my breath waiting for you to do so.  

Haha, you can find that out for yourself. Why don't you provide the evidence for your belief? I don't think that there's evidence  needed for everything, as I said, but you seem to. Rationality doesn't always include evidence either.
I'll gladly excuse your impatience, but I'm not going to make the effort to convince you now, if you're not listening anyway. Best of luck learning about this stuff, there's still much more to it than the incomplete approach you take. Also, if it isn't clear to you yet, I'm not trying to convert you here. As I said, I only want to you to get out of your atheist, rationalist and scientist tunnel-vision. Good luck with that and take care.

3691,"&gt; Why would the possibility of total war be a fiction? 

The Pentagon puts US military requirements for steel and aluminium at 3% of current domestic production each:

https://www.commerce.gov/sites/commerce.gov/files/department_of_defense_memo_response_to_steel_and_aluminum_policy_recommendations.pdf

The US military is the most capable on the planet by a wide margin and you'd have to enlarge it massively to saturate domestic steel and aluminium production (and that's assuming that you've somehow lost all your allies who could supply you with more of the stuff, e.g. Canada).

Who in fuck do you imagine you'd be fighting in that scenario?



&gt;It's possible that a proxy war in the ME or SEA against China in the future could escalate to the point that the economy is mobilized for war. 

We're not in the 40ies anymore, you can't quickly repurpose car plants etc. to make modern battle tanks, steel and aluminium supply wouldn't be the limiting factors in that wartime economy.
Nevermind that you don't need to enlarge your military to beat China anywhere outside their home turf with conventional weapons.


&gt;MAD is still a very new concept. 

It really isn't, it's not too much younger than the military use of aluminium.

&gt;To assume that humanity has now moved beyond total war and entered an eternal era of peace is a little naive to say the least.

Go ahead and point out where I made that assumption.

Moscow has felt like a different city, while the smallest host city of Saransk has seen a staggering 200-fold rise.
When I saw a huge Argentine flag on my university building in Moscow, I was surprised how excited I was.

&gt; Normally in Russia, if you want to hold a public gathering you have to put in a request in advance. If it is an opposition rally you're trying to organise, then the answer will probably be no. But for the World Cup that changed. Although protests in tournament cities were banned, police turned a blind eye to public drinking and partying, the kind of behaviour that would normally get you arrested.

&gt;&gt;In any case, Canada has filed those tariffs with the WTO (and can only lower them further, not raise them again within WTO rules outside a set of special circumstances).

&gt;1. Not according to your government. The EU and Canada have both filed disputes against each other in recent years.

&gt; 2. The WTO hasn't decided whether the US is in violation, and when it eventually reaches a decision, it might decide in our favor. It wouldn't be the first time.


and my now obsolete answer to it:


&gt;Simple Average Applied MFN tariff

Yes, that's one of the possible measures I alluded to but by no means the definitive one. A simple average across all the HS-6 categories isn't too meaningful (at least not if the values you are comparing are relatively close) 
because the volume (both the trade volume and the volume of demand inside the customs territory that applies the tariff) varies wildly across those categories.


(quoting myself here)

&gt;The EU's trade-weighted average MFN tariff was ~2.8% in 2016 (latest data available), the US' was 2.7%:

&gt;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/TM.TAX.MRCH.WM.FN.ZS?year_high_desc=true

&gt;That does not include trade that is given preferential access (under an FTA or through [GSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_System_of_Preferences)) e.g. within NAFTA or the EEA.

&gt;The trade-weighted average tariff across all trade was ~1.6% for both the EU and the US:

&gt;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/TM.TAX.MRCH.WM.AR.ZS?year_high_desc=true

&gt;Overall, the EU and the US have a very similar level of tariffs, a few significant economies are more open than the EU or US (Japan, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, New Zealand, Norway) but the vast majority of economies are far more protectionist than either.

&gt;And don't forget that the EU itself is a free trade area (like NAFTA but much deeper). If you look at the EU member states individually and count the trade between them (all with 0 tariffs of course), their average tariffs are a lot lower than the US' (the trade volume between EU states is a good deal larger than their extra-EU trade).

&gt;The EU acts as one entity in international trade but it is in fact a group of countries that have opened their markets to each other to an unprecedented degree.

&gt;Towards the outside, the EU is about as protectionst as the US (slightly more perhaps but not by much) and less protectionist than most economies on the Planet.

&gt;On the inside, it is the most ambitious experiment in free trade ever attempted.


The trade-weighted average has it's problem too, since high tariffs suppress trade and the additional trade volume that would be there in absence of tariffs is obviously rather hard to measure. 

Beyond those two measures, aggregate data becomes harder to come by. Tariffs weighted by the sales volume withing the customs territory in question would be interesting 
(though there would still be some distortion since prices would be somewhat lower and sales volume somewhat higher without tariffs).

The EU, US and Canada obviously have their offensive and defensive interests in different areas and hence their tariff profiles look quite different 
(subsidies have to be taken into account too since their effects partially overlap with those of tariffs) but to make the rather slight differences in overall protectionism (/market openness) between them out to be some huge divide is just silly.

If Trump actually *was* interested in free trade, picking the EU and NAFTA as targets would be idiotic. I can only guess at what the purpose of starting a trade war with just about all other major economies at the same time is...





&gt;1. Not according to your government. The EU and Canada have both filed disputes against each other in recent years.

Would you mind pointing me to that EU/CA dispute case involving one side unilaterally raising their tariffs? 



&gt;2. The WTO hasn't decided whether the US is in violation, and when it eventually reaches a decision, it might decide in our favor. It wouldn't be the first time.

No, it hasn't and the chance is indeed non-zero since the national security exemptions in the WTO rules are rather fuzzy and potentially broader than others (anti-dumping measures, etc.)

Trumps' case is however about as flimsy as Bush's case was in 2002. The threat that steel imports from Canada and the EU pose to US military production capabilities is just as fictional as the supposed sudden surge in steel imports 
that the Bush admin. claimed as a reason for trade defense measures in 2002.

I'm quite familiar with the relevant figures at this point, the EU's and Canadas overall level of tariffs is very similar to the US'. I won't be doing the legwork for your ""18 out of 20"" claim (though I'd expect ""most of the G20"" to be broadly correct).



&gt; What matters is the ability of the domestic steel industry to meet the needs of the defense industry during the worst case scenario, meaning total war or something similar. 

Even without MAD, that scenario would be complete fiction (and starting a trade war with your closest allies doesn't exactly ensure your wartime steel supply).


&gt; Some if Canada's tariffs are also being disputed in the WTO. There are several open cases being made against them, not unlike Trump's metal tariff.

Go ahead and point me to those Canadian WTO disputes concerning things similar to what Trump is doing at the moment.

I mean our fucks up with the turks are probably the greatest. Ankara 1402, saving the Ottoman treasury and Bayezids son after the battle of Ankara, where the Turks lost to Tamerlan. 

Then we had the Byzantines and never ending civil war between Palaiologos and Kantakouzenos (who was the first that brought turkish mercenary into Europe)

Then the three way civil war in Bulgaria, the like 10 way split in Serbia, with everyone deciding to fight their own way. 

The shitshow that was battle of maritsa.

The Serbian emperor Dusan considered becoming a catholic if Pope would let him lead a crusade, but in the end it never happened, relations soured when the hungarian king attacked serbia in 1354, while he was south trying to fight the turks and byzantines.

Then later you had the Council of Florence which was supposed to heal the schism and present a unifed front against the ottomans, but that failed. All the patriarchs showed up except the Serbian. Who was threatned with hanging if he went to negotiate. Then after that Russian patriarch when he come back was tortured and arrested I believe.  The monks of Athos were opposed to it as well.  Even though technically the agreement was made and signed by the greek and russian patriarch, so one could say they're catholics now. 

I mean pretty much the entire war with the ottomans was ""fuck you all I can do it alone"" and then failing. Except Dusan who died in mysterious circumstances.

3909,"Completely fair points there, and honestly, I do kind of agree with you somewhat, I guess?

On one hand, I do think it’s useless to respond to people who have no intentions of changing their beliefs even if they ask a question. Example: I do mass RES tags for really cancerous and toxic subs. That way I’m not wasting my energy on people who have no intention of ever opening up their mind. 

But what’s difficult is trying to tell the people who have a genuine question from the people who want to cherrypick one specific example of your answer to discredit everything you say. And, I don’t know, I do think this comes from a place where I was pretty curious about terrible things when I was younger, and to an extent, still am. I wanted to know about what made communism so bad after one of our teachers would constantly tell us Russia sucks because at one point they were communist. So I learned. And I came away from it agreeing that communism, yeah, isn’t such a good thing. 

I was also born a few years after the Cold War ended, so the only memory that I’ve had of it was the few products in my grandparents’ home that had “Made in West Germany” on the side. So yeah, I can say I’ve lived a very privileged life where Nazism and Communism has seemed like something that happened a long time ago. 

And of course, you are completely right that it is a little bit more difficult for us Americans to understand putting a lid on racist ideologies. We do parade around the concept of free speech a lot, but now I’m seeing the rise of people with stupid podcasts who will invite awful racists like this on and never debunk any of their false claims. 

And I do agree that responses aren’t effective with these public figures like Southern. But for normal people who just happened to stumble on it, there might be a chance that bringing up the facts, and proving that these people are wrong, will be a stepping stone in understanding why these people are completely wrong with their ideologies they’re spreading. 

For example, Southern’s Patreon was taken down so she wouldn’t get monthly payments from her audience of racists. Then the creator of Patreon posted a video informing people he took down her page because she was trying to fuck with rescue boats who had migrants on it, and he didn’t want any money she made through his platform to be going towards that. I think that was the perfect response. 

So I think the best course of action would be to deplatform people spreading toxic ideologies, then explain why it had to be done. And if they already have a platform that wouldn’t go away by removing the ways to connect with their audience, I think the best way would be to prove them wrong at every instance you can. And then, preventing the next group of people who want to spread a toxic ideology to others from ever being able to gain a platform.

But of course, I do agree that for Europeans, it’s... I don’t know, I guess easier to put a lid on toxic ideologies? Maybe? There’s still effects from war on your land. There’s still countries recovering from the problems of being satellite states during the Soviet Union. There’s still evidence that a mass genocide happened on your land. 

Here in the US, we don’t have many of those. We have to learn through books and pictures we search up online. And it’s just not the same. The only thing we have close to visual effects of a terrible past is we can play a game where, looking at a building, we can determine if this building used to house a really, *really* shitty pizza chain. 

During the Cold War, celebrities who had communist sympathizes would not have careers because of a Hollywood blacklist. There were some notable examples where some who did, in fact, have communist sympathies would slip through the crack but for the most part, I’d say we put the lid on a lot of them. But with the power of the internet, anyone can gain a following. If YouTube doesn’t work out, you can move to another site. Get banned on there? Make a blog. And it continues. So I think that preventing these people from making a living off of it is a good thing, but specifically getting them off all social media is a little bit more tricky. 

I’m sorry, this is really long and there’s plenty of contradictions in here, but I don’t know. I’ve gone back and forth on this subject a lot, and I don’t think I have some perfect answer that everyone should follow. I don’t think there’s any right, perfect answer, really. The perfect thing would be for these ideologies to never exist, and now they’ve gained traction again in the world. I think this is a very complex situation and any discussion about this helps me see things from a different light. And I don’t have the perfect solution for this because I don’t run every platform these people have, I’m just some person who watches these people (with Adblock on) and supports people who respond to these people with a calm explanation on why these people are wrong, bringing up studies and statistics when possible to show why they are completely full of shit.

So I guess that I’m optimistic that some regular people who are sliding towards toxic ideologies may be able to be convinced by someone who can point out why *insert your pick of a toxic figure with a platform* is full of shit. But when they’re too far gone, posting on really shitty subreddits, it’s pointless to engage with them. The people with the platforms themselves, though, should probably be deplatformed, or at the very least, make it next to impossible to be able to profit on spreading hate. If these people have to get a regular job, that’s less time they can contribute to traveling the world with other racists and trying to take down boats with migrants on them.

3931,"&gt; Actually 18 of the 20 G20 members have higher tariffs than the US, according to the WTO.

[citation needed] (the overall level of tariffs/protectionism isn't all that easy to nail down, there is no one clearly correct measure)

In any case, Canada has filed those tariffs with the WTO (and can only lower them further, not raise them again within WTO rules outside a set of special circumstances). 

What the US has done is raise tariffs in breach of their WTO commitments

The US claims those tariffs fall under the national security exceptions within the WTO rules ([GATT Art. XXI](https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/gatt47_02_e.htm#articleXXI)) (among other things because Trump can only enact tariffs without Congress if they are necessary to 'protect national security') but there is next to no chance that that will hold up in the WTO dispute settlement process given that the demand of US defense production only accounts for a small fraction of domestic steel &amp; aluminium production and the US is applying those tariffs to it's closest allies.",Germoney,/r/europe/comments/8ywonf/lets_make_a_list_of_canadian_products_we/e2eetj9/,Kaktus_Kontrafaktus,1531609945

In fact, the agreements that are conditional to NS2 that germany extracted from russia, as others have mentioned here, make this actually much harder, if not impossoble for Russia. So NS2 actually 'increases' safety from these blackmail attempts to EU countries. 
And it definitely by evident fact does not 'increase' it by any measure. Because Russia was already doing it before either NS existed.

There was a news that Russia increases Vat from 18 to 20% and there is no crisis in the world and oil prices go up. Is their problem all because of western sanctions? Russia will be less of the threat also because of the demographics. They have less than half of potential recruits than not long time ago. But I wouldn't say NATO should worry about China, as NATO is about North Atlantic, where China has barely started to be present. China is American problem now. While Russia can still do something stupid to it's NATO neighbors in order to use the big investment into modernising it's army while it's still worth something.

because the threat is at the border.

anyway, I don't see that much focus of NATO on Russia, more like awareness on ""let's prepare if the neighbors do some crazy shit"".

For example, the German - Russian business relationships are blooming (e.g. NS2 and BASF) - these are some weird sanctions. 

also to make an analogy: S Korea has a much bigger budget than N Korea. Still, they won't say ""let's stop focusing on military, they will die as an economy""

And...

""A remedy which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision, especially when there is any degree of phimosis. The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anesthetic, as the brief pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment, as it may well be in some cases. The soreness which continues for several weeks interrupts the practice, and if it had not previously become too firmly fixed, it may be forgotten and not resumed.""

**Kellogg, J.H. (1888). Plain Facts for Old and Young. 1910 ed., p. 325 **


In other words: ""Burn their clits or snip their bits... without anesthetic! ""

In her 1978 article *The Ritual of Circumcision*, Karen Erickson Paige wrote: ""The current medical rationale for circumcision developed after the operation was in wide practice. The original reason for the surgical removal of the foreskin, or prepuce, was to control 'masturbatory insanity' – the range of mental disorders that people believed were caused by the 'polluting' practice of 'self-abuse.'""

[According to this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence_of_circumcision#Europe), by the mid 80's, only about 6.5% of British children were being circumcised for ""medical"" reasons, and this was mostly for misdiagnosed cases of phimosis, so cases like yours are exceptionally rare.",,/r/europe/comments/8yhuxz/norwegian_hospitals_refuse_to_assist_in/e2e1qsr/,Alkorai,1531596063

The reason why Lithuania wanted Vilnius was to make sure that Poland would remain an enemy so that Lithuania would not agree to a confederation with Poland which would end like previous confederation - with the marginalization of Lithuanian political elites.

4247,"&gt;According to the Polish goverment of that time and they had a vested interest with such claim. 

According to historical data collected by the Russians who ruled this area for over a century.     

According to Germans who occupied it during the first world war and had plans for creation of Mitteleuropa.

According to Soviet authorities managing the population transfer after the war.   

The only side perpetrating egregious distortion of historical fact are Lithuanian nationalists who will stop at nothing to promote their  agenda which is to use nationalist division to get into power.

There is your lie. You used this word and then you come saying you are not here discussing what a genocide is. If your are not able to discuss the definition of what a genocide is, you better not use this word. As for terror you may read more book and less Reddit on the matter you may have so pretty surprise as for the real number. 

&gt;""because first republic did many good things""

And that lad please tell me where I said about the first republic? Where do you quote me from? The first lead us to civil war and an empire do I praise it? No. Do I accept its legacy? Yes. Fully. See the difference. 

I said 
&gt;I know the crime committed in the West of France and elsewhere and it doesn't change that I would support the Republic despite its flaws and its mistakes over any other political system today. 

I know what happen and knowing it doesn't change that between a past flawed regime and the current flawed republic I choose this one. I do not need to create false words and facts to turn the monarchists of 200 years ago into blood thirty beasts. We fucking chant it every time and it may be the most honest anthem on Earth: *lets have an impure blood water our furrows*.  Our current political regime was built because some fought for it against coalitions, foreign invaders, domestic threats and others. Like every other ones but at least we recognize it and remember it. We do not sing about some beautiful rivers or how nice the sun is shinning or because some imaginary friend no one has ever seen put some fat ass on a chair because his ancestor by alliance had the balls to hold a sword on the battlefield 1200 years earlier. 

So without sugarcoating it, yes I accept the legacy of the RepublicS, good and bad, the same way I accept the legacy of the past monarchies, the little of it good and the much bigger bad of it but since it is according to 21th perspective it doesn't matter much, and I remember that having this current Republic and the little liberties we have required some guys to kill some other guys. Happy?

So if you are surprised that using a word like ""genocide"" require to be able to explain it and wonder were the lie is and if you are able to use ""lighter version of soviet terror"", events more than an century apart with ludicrous death number in comparison, you may need to open a book.

4357,"In a sense it does. Though this specific thing is more about countries having some countries whose concerns are more important to them than others.

More powerful countries are, more powerful. The EU is not a fix for a basic function of reality being real.
Even within nations you have constantly conflicts of interests between regions. 
The EU is not a instrument to erase the inevitable power differences between EU countries. But to buffer their effect. You can talk about the ""common good"" all day long but at the end of the day Who has the authority to determine it? So determining it will inevitable be a struggle, which involves leveraging of power.
The only issue with that statement I take is the implicit pretense that the ""eastern/cee/newer"" countries are acting any different, rather than having the option les often.

Edit: 
To illustrate what I mean. And I apologise to the poles, because it might seem I'm ribbing on them in this thread which is actually not my intention. Its just the examples most prominently on peoples minds.
For example, Poland feels perfectly fine leveraging the EUs instruments to try to stop NS2. And attack germany for ignoring these instruments. At the same time, Poland rejects the immigrant relocation scheme, despite it having passed every single legislative and authorising body the EU itself. So ignoring them is bad when it suits Polands interests, but good, provided it suits Polands interests.

A helicopter was flying around above Seattle when an electrical malfunction disabled all of the aircraft's electronic navigation and communications equipment. Due to the clouds and haze, the pilot could not determine the helicopter's position.

The pilot saw a tall building, flew toward it, circled, and held up a handwritten sign that said: WHERE AM I? in large letters. People in the tall building quickly responded to the aircraft, drew a large sign, and held it in a building window. Their sign said YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER!

(I don't know who ""you"" refers to above, but let's move on.)

Irish GDP grew by 25% *according to the methodology devised by Eurostat*. Ireland's Central Statistics Office has pointed out that that methodology artificially inflates the size of the economy and is overly sensitive to one-off transactions, and that the true figure for GDP is much lower. Moreover, it has proposed an alternative measure, GNI*, which gives a much more realistic measure of economic activity and results in more modest and consistent figures for growth.

If you want more insight into myself, my identities are fully clear to me, I am from Cáceres (which by the way is a whole fucking different that which of Badajoz), I am proudly Extremaduran, proudly Spanish, proudly european and a human being just like you. Every step just give more complexity to who I am, and not always each step falls armouniously with each other, but what is stupid is to fault part of who I am for the problems I as a complex human being percieve. 

Catalans are not nationalist, some are, and definitely far more than you feel yourself comfortable with admiting. If you want to eliminate part of what defines you, then the problem is only with you.

Neither me or the mayority of spaniards blame you, the different people of catalonia for our troubles. What we are sick off is the condescending treatment we get, as if you interpreted yourselfs better off, having sed the burden carriying us. What makes the most of us sick is the active attempt of damaging our country, may you feel part of it or not.

What do you think someone like me who has had to emigrate to get a better life can think of when a bunch of parias go and block a highway, which is not even owned by the state, to blame perfidious Spain for their troubles and I have to spend 3 fucking more hours by train just to go back home??  Is that just to you?

Have you ever thought that just as you angry at the complications bestowed upon upon you, the rest of us have the same problems. Sometimes even worse because we happened to be born somewhere less strategically important than catalonia, and therefore are subject to simply have 0 attention or development. 

 

Don't try to sell me how it is only a matter of freedom beacause it is not. There is very clear identity problem behind all of this. 

May it be motivated by economy, the dichotomy of having particularities (as all of us have in our respective regions), real greeviances or simple and pure ignorance.

As a result, lots of economists believe that emissions/energy use figures are a more reliable source of understanding the real state of the Chinese economy. 

When emissions remained stable for a couple of years in China, lots of environmentalists took it as a turning point, but in reality it was simply a sign of the hidden economic crisis which the Chinese government was obscuring in the official figures.

4543,"OK, some details. First, Chinese companies are shielded, they can't be bought by external companies. But they can buy US or American companies. Chinese government is far from being idiots.

Second, newegg is an online store for pc parts. We do have equivalents in Europe, I always bought my pc parts online, but not from Amazon. So yes, there is space and companies like that, but usually, they serve the local market. The one we have in Spain (pc componentes) had 271M sales. 10 less than newegg, but in a market smaller than 10% of the US. Relatively speaking, you can consider them more successful than newegg. Those EU companies need to move from country based business model to EU based one. Not an easy step to do, as there is usually a similar company.

But still, newegg is an specialized online retailer, it does not look to have the potential to become a tech giant playing on the same league.

In the end, most businesses first cater the local market and then go to international expansion. The US market is massive, by the time a company has taken hold of that market is already a giant and can proceed towards international expansion. And if you have a giant competing against many smaller ones, it can go into defeating them one by one.

The question is, which national security is more important for Germany. German national security. Or every other national security. 

And that's why Germany doesn't stop the project. Even as a private project NS2 is good for Germany, it increases energy security. Because it cuts out middlemen from gas delivery. And one of these middlemen has in the past impaired gas delivery because they continued to take out gas after Russia stopped selling gas to them.

I don't know about that.

In fact that experience - of those that actually lived under really existing communism and capitalism it is pretty much uniform across the ex-communist bloc 

&gt; Between 2011 and 2018 many things had changed; the country currently has the lowest unemployment in its history, and the economy grows on average 3.5%, so poll from 2011 is irrelevant.

I'm not interested in your irrelevant notes on the economy since the 90s or your personal opinion. I'd like to see a poll stating those that lived under really existing communism and then the free market say that a majority prefer the free market. What's more you point to the 2008 global depression as if it were an anomaly and not a 7-10 on average repeat feature of capitalism.

4662,"&gt;In most high-stakes diplomacy—denuclearizing North Korea, attempting to make China play by international norms of trade and commerce, keeping Vladimir Putin within his borders, destroying ISIS, isolating a theocratic and potentially nuclear Iran, and the perennial Israel and Palestinian problem—Europe is largely a spectator.

1. *denuclearizing North Korea:* **True**, but Europe was never a major player in this conflict because of simple geography.

2. *attempting to make China play by international norms of trade and commerce:* **Wrong**. EU goes through the proper international institutions (for example WTO: [EU launches WTO case against China’s unfair technology transfers](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1852)), while the US under Trump tries to undermine these institutions by [vetoing all new judges.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-wto-analysis/trumps-bonfire-of-the-treaties-sweeps-towards-the-wto-idUSKCN1IJ1K9)

3. *keeping Vladimir Putin within his borders*: **Wrong.** The majority of [sanctions on Russia are European](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/2015/russia/sanctions-after-crimea-have-they-worked/EN/index.htm). Furthermore two of the four Battlegroups in [NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_136388.htm) are lead by European nations &amp; the majority of soldiers are European. On the digital front, Europeans are also engaged (for example: [Dutch intelligence penetrated Russian hacker group Cozy Bear](https://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/dutch-agencies-provide-crucial-intel-about-russia-s-interference-in-us-elections~b4f8111b/)). With the *Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement* Ukraine was also taken out of the Russian sphere of influence (which prompted Russian aggression in Eastern Ukraine &amp; Crimea in the first place).

4. *destroying ISIS*: **Wrong.** Many European nations were involved. Ranging from Air campaigns, arms delivery and training of armed forces to development aid.

5. *isolating a theocratic and potentially nuclear Iran*: **Wrong**. JCPOA while not perfect was an agreement that solved most of the problems with Iran (half of the signatories where European). And after the US decided to unilaterally breach the agreement, European nations are in the process of finding a solution, so that Iran doesn't start producing nukes.

Not really much at all. When I first learned about it I was sad because of all the culture and history that must have been lost when the people living there were forcefully expelled. And of course in the eyes of a child/teenager bigger typically means better (lol) so yeah was a bit sad at first that the better BIGGER Germany was no longer a thing. 

But at the end of the day it doesnt really matter since there are no longer any Germans living there and we have more than enough ""land"" in the borders we were given.

4785,"Kinda yes, but mostly no.

I don't want to look up my claims, so take everything that follows with a big grain of salt.

Nordstream's main goal is not to be profitable, but to increase the security of access to energy. Most russian gas pipelines go through other countries due to geography. These countries charge money for the gas-transit. A direct line would thus make gas in germany cheaper. This would take income from eastern european countries and move it to Germany, which on a european scale is a zero-sum-game, on an equality level is close to taking the money of those in need.

Furthermore the relationship between some transit countries and Russia is currently not too great. For example Ukraine is openly hostile against Russia but has one of the main transit pipelines. Ukraine additionaly refuses to pay the aggreed rates for russian gas (which may very well be intentionally set to be too high as a predatory exploitation of market position ) and ""steals"" the gas it wants. Russia doesn't want to close off the pipeline despite this disagreement, because a good part of europe hangs on that line and people would freeze in winter.

Should those tensions escalate, the energy security of europe could no longer be guaranteed. This is probably the main point of the project's proponents.

With Nordstream being built, Russia could potentially blackmail eastern european countries without too much backlash from the remaining countries - I think this is the big fear of those, that are against this project.",,/r/europe/comments/8yr1nj/tusk_nord_stream_2_is_a_mistake/e2d6ywn/,Zwiebelbart,1531553618

4880,"&gt;Yes you do, you have streets named after them and monuments. Thats the problem really.

2 streets +zero monuments ... HUGE PROBLEM. Polish politics like to lie very much.. very.. about UPA, Ukraine, glorification of something about what 99% even do not know. Polish tradition to lie about Ukraine. 

&gt;Can you see how retarded it sounds? Its whitewashing of genocide and you are never allowed to that. Gallician UPA did not attack millitary organisation, they attacked INNOCENT civilians.
If i transfered that sentence in similar way

what about AK? Germans ?USSR? Why all of them thought that they were killed by UPA. 
There is one problem. Not everything what is caaled in your books UPA was UPA... There were SS Galicina and some other organisations which worked for Germans and do dirty job, but in 1941-1945 these people were not UPA. Maybe later some of them jooined UPA. But in that period they were - German soldier. And they executed Germans orders. ANd that all are in archives of KGB which Polish government do not want to discover. 

All this stories about massacre looks like total madness in Polish books. 5K of UPA killed 100K of civilians +a lot of AK and German soldiers...???? 5K Rambo with unbeliable skills and organisation? 
Meanwhile all polish articles I wrote there were written about few villages where were killed people. But it was there about 300-500... in totally maybe- 5-10 K citizens. How than it appears that UPA killed 100K? How do Polish historians found out that it was UPA? How? all these story looks like communistic tale. Do all these Polish historians were communists? LOL yes. Do KGB liked to make agents from historians ??? yes. 

Fro example do you know who is the most famous Ukrainian historian, who is KGB agent? and these person still works now for FSB????? your Polish liar politics always like to mention - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iryna_Farion. So she was a KGB agent. and it is prooved fact. But all people for unknown reason think that she is NATIONALISTIC leader in Ukraine. 

&gt;How:
By using tactics they learned while being in nazi police (willingly) and while they helped killing jews.
They focused small villages (avoided town and cities) attacked in early hours (3am-5am) on ususpecting and unarmed CIVILIANS. Then roud them up in biggest building and burned them alive. Then tortured in unspeakable way the leftovers. Repeat with every village

There is no evidence of working of UPA on Germans during WW2. There are a lot of facts of working on GErmans of other people and - after USSR come some of these guys joined UPA. But in 1943- they were German soldiers. 

So your writting that people who killed Jewish by German order, decided to kill Polish and Germans do not have any connection to that? Do not you think that it looks strange. People who works for Germans and were germans soldiers, police did something without order? 

&gt;I mean apart from the fact that UPA-B and Nazis wer buddy-buddy And UPA were in nazi ranks officially?
They didnt care, Nazi plan was to exterminate or reduce slavic people anyway.

Do you know that what you wrote is total lie? without any evidence. and even beyound the logic. UPA - B = BAndera. Where was BAndera in 1941-1945? Where? He was in German death camp. So you want to say that UPA-B cooperated with while Bandera was ordered to death? There are a lot of German documents in which they wrote about UPA that they are enemies. And there is no proofs of what you said. 

&gt;Because just like Russians on Smolens execution, you refused to provide.
I think you wrote somewhere before that polish were not persecuted in Prussian and Russian occupation.

Do not lie again please. In 2005 Ukraine opened SBU (KGB) archives. And from that time ask Poland to send someone -every year. But Poland did not send anyone for all that time? there are a lot of information not only abou UPA AK, also about USSR kills of Polish. But noone come? Why? 

EveryPolish politics which says MAssacre Volihnia UPA Bandera NAtionalistic gets a lot of attention , votes , TV, Press ... 

Every Polish politics who says that words  trade deeath of that Polishes in Volihnia on votes of present Polishes. Every. 

So Polish politics do not need truth. Because truth will be very bad for that PERFECT trade. 

Do not you think so? ANSWER PLEASE. 

&gt;And the list goes on and on. It was even worse in Tzar Russia While ukrainians in RP2 had heaven on earth and in return made genocide on civilians.

As for scaring voters, you must remember there were two campaigns that often get confused. The official ""Vote Leave"" campaign is the one Dan Hannan was part of (which also had one UKIP MP as well as Johnson and former Chancellors), this was the campaign the electoral commission made the official campaign. Then there was the ""Leave.EU"" campaign, that is the unofficial campaign (a private entity) that had people like Nigel Farage or Aaron Banks involved.

The ""Vote Leave"" campaign focused on economic arguments and arguments of independence. The ""Leave.EU"" campaign focused on immigration issues as well as general independence arguments. So Dan Hannan would never have been making arguments for leaving the EU based on Turkey possibly joining, and I am pretty sure he will be aware that it was the British that pushed for the original expansions into the Eastern European countries and later Turkey (he does not come across like a stupid man).

I must admit I have enjoyed his debating style (him against Eddie Izzard was especially enjoyable) and whilst I might not always agree with him, I will say, I have never heard him be against migration across the board, so I could not see him making that argument.

You're lucky they didn't manage to retract, but that could have easily been the basis for a lawsuit. You might also want to reach out to some anti-circumcision groups to atleast spread awareness about who's tried to pull this on you, or even try to educate them (pretty unlikely).

""commonly known by its former name of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic"" - Artsakh is the name of the region, in the Armenian language.

You also hilariously entered the discussion with the assumption that ""Azerbaijanis are still killing Armenians in Artsakh,"" when Azerbaijanis firstly do not have control of this region, and a huge bulk of **Azerbaijani deaths and exiles** are from the region of ""Artsakh,"" you interpreted things backwards. It was the Azerbaijanis who were victims in Nagorno-Karabakh, genius.

5071,"You were sold a bill of goods. A free trade agreement is a much weaker link that a customs union... under a customs union a trucker can literally just drive over the border with zero issue, there's absolutely no trade friction. Under an FTA there still have to be customs inspections, which can delay transit for months in some cases. Right now it's probably little more difficult to have something shipped to you from Germany than from London, you could probably get it express delivered. For instance, right now most of the British car industry relies on just in time production, they order parts from the rest of europe and keep a minimal inventory because they can get them quickly. Without a customs union, that's going to be impossible, and they're going to have to move to keeping huge stockpiles of parts so that they can guarantee they don't run out of anything critical while waiting on shit to make it through customs.

The nature of a customs union prevents individual free trade agreements of course. Because an FTA with any one nation would essentially be an FTA with them all. Croatia could sign a free trade agreement with China and China would basically have free trade with all of Europe, because there would be no customs inspection at the border of Croatia to make sure the goods a really Croatian and not Chinese. Whereas mere FTA's have a complex set of rules for deciding what makes a product Croatian vs. Chinese, but would require lengthy customs inspections to enforce these rules (and another customs inspection at every single border).

And the way things are going now, honestly, it looks like your keeping the Customs Union. Which will make it *impossible* to sign individual FTAs, by the nature of a customs union. But this is probably a *good* thing, it's a lot more valuable to have a customs union with nations that constitute 45% of your exports than an FTA with those responsible for like ~60% of them (EU + US + Canada + Whatever).",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8yitdn/italy_wont_ratify_eu_freetrade_deal_with_canada/e2crmgd/,watermark02,1531532251

You have no evidence at all that removing the clitoral hood would lead to this, other than growing up in a culture that's denuded male sexuality for generations at birth, and think that's the natural state of things, so female sexuality seems more dynamic and profound by comparison, and you see things like your baseless deification of the clitoris.

In Islam, the traditional form of female circumcision involves varying reduction of the clitoral hood. Sometimes they remove just a tiny piece, other times they remove much more. Many Western women get clitoral hood reductions to expose their clitoris more.

I am not aware of any of these women reporting it being painful to walk.

On the other hand, I've heard of a lot of circumcised men reporting discomfort and even pain from their glans rubbing against fabric. Not the norm, but far from unheard of.

I'd compare clitoral hood removal to removal of the foreskin, because that, like the foreskin, is most likely where the majority of the innervation and fine-touch reception of the genitals is located. By contrast, the clitoris, like the glans, is probably far less sensitive and is primarily protopathic in nature. Where you think you're getting sensation from the clitoris, it's the clitoral hood. Same for men and their glans vs. the foreskin.

""That little nub"" isn't the clitoris, by the way, that's just the external part. It's mostly an internal structure that can extend up to several inches in the body. But don't listen to me, treating it just as that little nub serves to make it out to be more important than it is (and it is important, but it's not this epicenter of all pleasure you believe it is, despite being a woman).",,/r/europe/comments/8yhuxz/norwegian_hospitals_refuse_to_assist_in/e2cs2vy/,Alkorai,1531532768

Only cow beef used for meat is allowed limited growth hormones. It is not okay to use in dairy production nor is it used in any other meat industry, like poultry or pork. What you say is mostly irrelevant.

I might add that the EU currently only bans meat using the hormone 17-beta estradiol, specifically. As far as I know, that hormone is not currently in use. Furthermore, the ability to add additional growth hormones to cattle does not mean that this is regular practice. Any organic beef must be free of added hormones.

5215,"&gt;Yeah, because terrorism in general wasn't really a thing back then, anywhere on the world. What makes terrorism work is media coverage generating hysteria -- this requires a certain technology level.

I do not agree with this. There are no terrorist from, say, Serbia or people from European descent. Why is that? Maybe a certain ideology that people are keen on allowing inside unprocessed is at fault for the recent terrorist acts. As I said, the Belgian terrorist attack, for example, was done by a ""refugee"". And there are reports that ISIS members are posing as refugees in Germany and are on a list. 

&gt;So basically, we shouldn't care for refugees fleeing war zones because they ""have it easy"" compared to you?

5265,"&gt; How do you suggest we filter them without anyone abusing the system?

We already have a process in place, it just seems to be severely underfunded and undermanned, causing the agencies involved to often not properly follow through on things. Plus, deportations not happening quick enough, which is a separate issue but fueling the same controversy.

I don't think there can be a general ""fixed"" path for checking peoples' applications, as their situations may differ so much, but imagine: if you just close the route completely, you'd even condemn refugees who still have their passes. There wouldn't even be an investigation, even where the individual in question would have a 100% chance at having asylum granted.

To me, this feels like choosing between ""guilty until proven innocent"" and ""innocent until proven guilty"" -- you may well catch more criminals with the former, but it's a steep price to pay in collateral damage.

&gt; Due to us paying Libya to do their job. Meaning closing the route.

Point taken. That's actually rather worrisome, considering what we know of those camps.

&gt; So warn them, put it on the news. Tell them that they are not going to get smuggled here and are probably being enslaved.

Do you really think that would work, though? Many migrants may not even have a TV they can watch, especially given some regions' shitty electric grid. And then there's the question of how many people might still try. Smugglers could just tell them we're saying this just so not too many people come here at once.

Hope and desperation make people do crazy things sometimes, including ignoring common sense.

Not that I'd be against such measures, I just don't have high hopes for them. With all the stuff that's going on in the desert and on the sea for years now, you'd think it would have already reached them *if* they were capable of receiving news.

&gt; I'd like to mention that you are one of the people that I had a please arguing with in this thread.

Why, thank you! Let me return the compliment, then. We may disagree on some points, but I also feel we have *some* common ground, and it was a civil debate. :)

I realize it's a very controversial/heated topic, and unfortunately there's so much polarization or even misinformation going on, from both sides of the issue.

I actually like to think I'm more or less ""in the center"" concerning the refugee crisis, in that on one hand I agree on deportations and the idea of EU reception centers in Africa, but on the other hand also draw a hard line at stopping asylum altogether, which necessitates looking at every case. It's all about finding compromises, I think.

Also attempts at tackling the source of migration, i.e. investments into the countries of origin, or UN-led military intervention to stabilize a region, but I think those are less contentious issues.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8yhigr/italys_interior_minister_refuses_to_let_migrants/e2cc7e1/,akashisenpai,1531516500

5376,"&gt; The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has agreed to build a three-star command center in Romania, which will host around 400 troops, Romanian president Klaus Iohannis said at the end of the NATO summit in Brussels.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, NATO will upgrade the Multinational Brigade in Romania to a permanent base.
&gt; 
&gt; “A third result, which is also very important, is that the entire session was practically organized at our initiative and at our approach. I’m talking about the session dedicated to the Black Sea, which took place in the presence of the allies, with guests from Georgia and Ukraine. So, that session took place at our initiative. This happened amid the approach started in 2015 to put the Black Sea region on the NATO map, which I can say we have succeeded. Meanwhile, there are plans for the Black Sea region, there is an intense NATO approach, there is a very good ally presence in the Black Sea area. All of this we have obtained with great persuasion,” Iohannis also said.
&gt; 
&gt; At the summit, Romania agreed to increase the number of troops in Afghanistan, from about 770 at present to over 950 next year. The country will also continue to spend 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defense, Iohannis announced.
&gt; 
&gt; “For Romania, the announcement is simple, we are at 2% and we maintain that level. It was discussed, but without making a decision, to try to go even further, and probably at the next NATO summits we will have an approach that attempts to cross the level of 2%,” the Romanian president said.

5463,"&gt; Sure and we do not allow non religious people to ban religion as a whole.

No shit, just the violent parts among some others.

&gt;  Me, as a non religious person, do not believe in taking away religious freedoms that are not a great problem for society. I haven't seen massive demonstrations of circumcisized men demanding their foreskin back. I think and believe that we have more important issues to pay attention to.

It doesn't have to be a huge societal problem to criticize it or want it made illegal. If female genital mutilation was legal and there weren't massive demostrations, I'd still be against that too. If beating your children with your belt until they were bruised was legal, I'd be against that too, even if zero people demonstrated against it. They have rights too, whether they're a baby or a 10 year old.

&gt; But enough radical extremists, who believe that religious freedom should be muzzled completely, are willing to force their view on life upon every single human being.

Being against circumcision doesn't mean you're advocating muzzling religious freedom completely, it just means you can't cut the foreskin off from a healthy baby. That's it, and that's not radical extremism either. You can still pray to your Gods, you can still celebrate religious holidays, you can still read your Quran or Torah, you can still decide to not eat certain foods. Do you see the pattern here?

Wrong. Only cheese produced in accordance with the rules set out in the Production Regulations may bear the Parmigiano-Reggiano trademark. As with pizza verace.

Sure. First up, every medical procedure bares risks, especially in the genital region. That risk grows, depending on how common circumcisionis i.e. how experienced the surgeon is. Kids die because of circumcisions. 

Then, we are talking about a skin with many nerv endings. Painful nerve damage and physical trauma are not unusual. 

There also is the risk of psychological trauma - In many regions narcotics are not used, but I doubt that is the case for Norway, which does lower the risk significantly. Still, the impact of pain and stress at an early age is not fully researched. 

You also loose the function of the foreskin, it protects against dehydration and bacteria.

5492,"This argument isn't helping your case.  There's no medical benefits to chopping off a pinky finger.  When you make absurd arguments like this, it shuts down discussion and closes minds.

The fact is that no baby has bodily autonomy, nor should they.  The premise is ridiculous.  If a child has frequent strep throat, do we need to wait until adulthood to let the child decide whether or not to have their tonsils removed?  Or wisdom teeth removal?  Or braces?  Or ear piercings?

A parent has to have the right to make these sorts of decisions for children, particularly when a case can be made for medical benefits.  So if a case is going to be made against infant circumcision, than it needs to be argued on two points:  1)  Debating the alleged benefits and 2) Making a case that the negatives outweigh the pros.

So far, I've seen zero convincing arguments along either point.  I've seen attempts, and tenuous points made.  But the indignation appears to mostly be based along the lines of ""We agree it's abhorrent to do it to girls - why would we do it to boys‽""   Well - because it's not remotely the same thing.  There are no alleged medical benefits to female circumcision, while there are numerous tangible and significant risks and consequences.

I wonder what could go wrong. /s

The EU already said that it wouldnt accept the British Pound has a form of payement for UK's debt. If the Pound lose its reserve statut and the UK has to do all its trade in a very expensive to them Euros or Dollars it could become the new Venezuela.

5498,"&gt;There are legitimate reasons to call Joe Crowley a relic from the past. His age is one, his politics another. But they're calling him a relic from the past predominantly because of his race.

I just gave you two very concrete reasons as to why that's not the case. 

I'll tell you another one: he doesn't even live in NYC. His official residence is there alright, but his family lives in Arlington, Virginia. His kids go to public schools there, not in NYC. And if there's some truth to the saying ""the wife is the heart of the family"", then there's also some truth to the saying ""home is where the heart is"".

And running for places where you don't even live in, is the MO of the old school establishment, not at all what the people expect nowadays.

You are the one trying to make this about race, when it isn't: It's about a corrupt establishment candidate losing against a local, less well funded candidate of the people. 

Race plays no part in this.

&gt;I have no love for Joe Crowley, but that's significant because it applies not only to him, but to the 30% or so of his district that's still white as well. What they're saying is that every white/Irish child in that district is a relic of the past from the first day they're born. Not only does that mean these children will grow up knowing they'll never be able to run for office or even class president, but it means they'll have to grow up knowing they'll never be completely welcome in their hometown either.

Again, you're projecting. You're the one framing things in terms of Race. Don't tell me the people, be them white or black or brown or purple, would rather vote for someone based on the color of their skin, rather than the content of their character.

Or maybe they do, hence Trump, although to be frank I don't know many orange people.

More: Look at the US presidential history...  There has been literally one non Caucasian male president, Obama. Now, all of a sudden, people feel like they're unelectable because they're white?? Because if you do, fuck off with that noise!! That's beyond insane!!

&gt;What's even worse is...they're right. He is a relic, and those children are as well.

IMO, yes they are: Publicly educated children (as in going to a private school for the sons and daughters of the rich elite only) have no fucking business representing the common man, because they're not the common man, be them white, black, latino or even fucking native American.

[Guys like this, otoh, do.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-4uJ6MX1I0) Are you gonna call him fucking brown?!

&gt; And if we don't want our children to have to grow up as relics, we need to shut our borders down now. Trump, as much of a bumbling idiot as he is, is right here.

Theeere we go... So, now the issue is the ""brown people""?

In your would view, you'd rather have a cunt of a man calling the shots, so long as he is white?! Ok, then...

How about making White America **not a relic** instead?! How about having ""White America"" stand for something more than, in broad terms:

- Pro Business;

- Anti Workers Rights;

- Pro Guns;

- Prayer at Schools;

- Tough on Petty Crime (aka Tough on the Poor);

- Lax on Corporate Crime (aka Soft on the Rich);

- Anti Abortion;

Because that's pretty much what the so called ""WASP America"" stands for these days, and they are proud of it!

And let me remind you, there was a time when it wasn't like this. White America is also responsible for the New Deal, the Emancipation Proclamation, and for empowering women and minorities.... FFS, Roosevelt even wore a fucking top hat!

If the ""White Anglo-Saxon and Protestant"" America wants to be ""electable"", it either:

- Needs to present clean slate candidates with agenda for the common good, workers rights, and the common everyday man regardless of color or creeed;

- Close off the country and kill and either kill off all the browns and blacks, or start pumping out children (good luck with that).

And it's pretty clear to anyone with an ounce of moral sense that one of these paths is the path of Evil. And it's not the one of ""social democracy""! ;)

&gt; Of course I don't. I just want my kids to have a place where they'll feel loved and welcomed growing up. I don't want to ever have my kid ask if he can grow up to be the president and have to tell him ""no, sorry, people like us are relics and would never be elected"".

Are you planing to raise your kids as little cunts, in an isolated gated community whew they ""believe Humans come in various colors shapes and sizes, but never actually seen one that isn't white with light hair and eyes""?

If not, then I'm pretty sure they'll be fine. Brown people are not your enemy.

Civil disobedience. Encourage ICE workers, police, social workers to not cooperate to the extent they can. And if you are one, do so. You can also engage with Trump supporters and discuss with like-minded folks on how to engage them. Even make workshops about this.

5566,"&gt; Well, I deny them that right because being European, as the name suggests, means that you are of European descent.

And who determines that? This thread originally was about Trumps comment about Europe losing culture. You're ancestry doesn't determine you're culture, therefore its stupid to be bound forever by where your ancestor came from. 

By your logic US Americans aren't real Americans, the Natives are.

&gt; One tactic would be to minimize letting people of low IQ race in, which pretty much kills the risk. It's alll about how you approach it, that's my approach.

&gt; Having a nation of only European or asian people would minimize that risk.

Which just proves that you don't want the entire race, because if IQ actually was the issue, you would at least try to get the smart people of their race. But you're even exluding them. Meanwhile I haven't heard anyone ever talk about the low intelligence native people and what they should do with them (well, except maybe Nazis...)

&gt; Nope

Read more carefully. They pointed it out themselves.

&gt; Oman is a safe country. Go there, do not cross half of Africa just for welfare.

Oman law makes it illegal for refugees to work. This can be a problem, as it's still fairly common in Africa to have relatives who rely on money being sent to them. Furthermore, established human smuggling routes are leading towards Libya and Europe, potentially making it easier to acquire transport there rather than to Oman.

5639,"&gt;No, the problem is not travelling between timezones, but having one country suddenly switching its time zone.

The problem is the same, it's not like a country will suddenly decide it fancies switching.

&gt;Train schedules are tightly coordinated. A train leaves Germany at 1500, and is scheduled to arrive in France at 1700. It has a free path, coordinated with both countries network operators. Now France suddenly switches its time zone, so that the 1700 is now 1800. The train then waits one hour at the border, in order to get the free path that was arranged for it.

Why would France suddenly switch time zone? Moreover, when scheduling across time zones, you'd use UTC (or similar) so the local timezone doesn't matter at all. You'd then display local times in timetabling.

Again, the issue here isn't the switches between daylight savings, it appears to be a failure to take into account time changes, and use a sensible approach for scheduling.  But given it's 2018, it really isn't an issue that is even close to being unsolvable (and seems to work all over the world..).

It is currently standard procedure for doctors to perform emergency medical procedures if the patient is incapable of consent and didn't explicitly refuse treatment beforehand. If, as you suggest, the patient's body should not be put under state control, this is an affront to their right to self-determination, and any unconscious person who needs invasive treatment to live should just die.

Do you actually believe this? Or is the state allowed to control people's bodies without their consent in certain circumstances?

Good. Then it's just a matter of degree. With these emergency procedures, policy is to make a reasonable estimate of a person's judgment if they were capable of informed consent.

From NCBI: ""If a vaccine were available that reduced HIV risk by 60%, genital herpes risk by 30%, and HR-HPV risk by 35%, the medical community would rally behind the immunization and it would be promoted as a game-changing public health intervention. Based on the medical evidence, banning infant male circumcision would deprive parents of the right to act on behalf of their children’s health. Parents should be provided with information derived from evidence-based medicine about the risks and benefits of male circumcision so that they can make an informed choice for their children. It would be ethically questionable to deprive them of this choice.""

Please research and debate the pros and cons instead of just responding based on your emotions. Let's keep the discussion scientific and more emotionally neutral. Read this paper. There are more benefits than what is shown in the quote. It also discusses potential cons. Then look at more research. Then look at the discussion. Then make an informed response.

Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684945/

Edit:
""In a cost-effectiveness analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, neonatal male circumcision in the United States was projected to increase quality-adjusted life-years and estimated to be cost-saving due to reduced HIV infections and subsequent treatment costs.6 If protection from genital herpes, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and penile and cervical cancer were considered in the analyses, the economic benefits most likely would be enhanced.""

Not to mention reducing the risk of phimosis, paraphimosis, blepharitis, HPV, and more. Read the paper. No increased of sexual dysfunction either.

Saying these people are culturally integrated in their new country is a bold statement. 

It wouldn't be that bad if people would divide themselves in all area's. In my own neigbourhood we have a few Turkish immigrants that got here because our country needed cheap labour. Their kids went to school with me and they speak our language (decent enough). Their kids had native friends and are pretty much indistinguishable from natives. They still have some parts of their own culture, but they act and react like a native would.

In Europe right now they are making sort of china towns of immigrants everywhere. These people are surrounded by other immigrants and don't integrate at all. These people can't join the workforce and pretty much leech on our social system. People that work a honest day work have to pay for these people and in some cases even leave their house or neighbourhood for immigrants.

Remarkably, in Britain, **Muslim groups (the Pakistanis and Bangladeshis) whose loyalty to Britain is often questioned, are the ethnic minorities who are most likely to report a British national identity.** Even more strikingly, in France, s**econd-generation immigrants of Maghreb origin feel no less likely ‘French’ than the native born**.

The only people i know that support currently the biggest and worst party [HDZ] are people who in some way were bribed for a vote. My aunt flat out admitted it, she during a job interview due to some connections was allowed to take the job thanks to some HDZ higher members on our island helping her out, pushing aside all other contenders that were more likely to work the job with a simple agreement that she has to always vote for them.

For an example, people responsible for heavily damaging our country, such as our old Prime Minister Ivo Sanader who is a member of the HDZ party, tried to escape to Austria after the country found out his dirty deeds. He only received a light, comfy prison sentence and a lil' wrist slap for his crimes of doing major damage to our economy and yet still their party won again and again.

It won't really change any time soon, as the majority of young people are leaving the country and our population keeps dropping like a fly, i myself included left this year and moved to Finland to live with my boyfriend, granted i do miss the land a lot, my family, the food and so forth but i sure don't miss the actual people ""leading"" our country or the many really shitty Croatian companies that don't respect the laws of worker rights at all.

If there was a right wrong solution and anybody had the same opinion there would be no discussion.
Also interest are different. USA and Germany have totally different Reason to protect those countries.


Also this was only the political standpoint. We could also go on geostragetical more military standpoint and many more.


And to your hurt your allies. Germany/EU would need to bring sufficient Protection and you needed to feel save. 
As having more allies is for protection always better, but it's harder to keep and the more influence you lose.  ",European Union,/r/europe/comments/8yc39v/germans_want_donald_trump_to_pull_us_troops_out/e2b0n3g/,Salix166,1531466501
