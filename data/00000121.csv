What is not similar is blasphemy laws, that's the controversial part we should all be criticizing.

329,"Frode Berg, a trusting pensioner, willingly worked for Norwegian intelligence. Then, he says, they hung him out to dry.

KIRKENES, Norway — Frode Berg says he never meant to be a spy.

Mr. Berg, a silver-haired Norwegian pensioner known by his neighbors to have a soft spot for neighboring Russia, was 60 when an acquaintance in his Arctic hometown recruited him in 2015 to work for Norway’s military intelligence. Over the next two years, on five trips across the border, Mr. Berg acted as a courier — mailing relatively small sums of cash and encrypted memory cards to a woman in Moscow he knew nothing about.

Then, one December morning in 2017 when he was in Moscow, Russian agents swept him up, bundled him into a brown Volkswagen van and sped him to the old K.G.B. headquarters. He spent the next two years in prison where, by his own account, he was treated fairly well.

Now, finally free, Mr. Berg is angry — but not at Russia.

“I was under pressure from the military intelligence service in Norway,” Mr. Berg, a former inspector along the Norwegian border with Russia, said in an interview after his release in a prisoner swap in November. “I trusted them that they will not send me to something dangerous in Russia. And they did.”

Mr. Berg was, by all appearances, a small-time player in a botched intelligence operation. But his tale embodies the tensions emerging as Western countries intensify their hunt for the Kremlin’s secrets.

His arrest has also shaken his hometown, Kirkenes, a prim, fjord-side community in Norway’s far north that has close economic ties with Russia. People in this Arctic seaport just west of the Russian frontier are upset that Mr. Berg, who spent decades promoting cross-border cooperation, had breached the trust those efforts were meant to build.

And they are furious that Norway — a NATO ally that abuts Russia in the strategically important Arctic region — has solicited intelligence help from its own citizens who frequently cross the border for business and cultural exchanges.

To NATO, Kirkenes is on the vanguard of East-West confrontation because it is just across the border from the Kola Peninsula, home to Russia’s powerful Northern Fleet and much of the country’s nuclear arsenal.

But to many who live in this isolated region, Russia is primarily a partner, driving their economy thanks to fishermen docking at their port and Russians making day trips to buy diapers and other Western goods.

“We want to promote this region as a region of cooperation, bringing down walls and building bridges,” said Marit Jacobsen, deputy head of the Norwegian Barents Secretariat, which funds cooperation projects with Russia. “We can handle one Frode Berg, but we cannot handle that many.”

‘A Good Norwegian’

During the Cold War, Mr. Berg was stationed as a soldier in Kirkenes, now a town of about 3,500 people. Sometimes he found himself a few feet from Soviet soldiers on patrol, but he never made eye contact.

He later became a border inspector and, after communism collapsed, he and his colleagues gave boots, uniforms and food to their suddenly impoverished Russian counterparts.

Fascinated by Norway’s newly accessible neighbor, Mr. Berg later traveled frequently to Russia and worked with a Kirkenes cross-border arts organization, Pikene pa Broen, to help coordinate its annual international festival.

Then, in 2015, a local politician asked for a favor, Mr. Berg recalls: Would he mind mailing 3,000 euros in cash, about $3,300, to an address in Moscow on his next trip to Russia?

It was an open secret, known to Mr. Berg, that this politician worked for Norway’s military intelligence agency. Mr. Berg trusted him, so he agreed without asking questions.

“What is this about, really?” Mr. Berg says he later asked another intelligence officer, in the Norwegian capital, Oslo, who gave him digital memory cards and more cash to mail.

“‘It’s very important that you can do this for me, Frode,’” the man in Oslo responded, according to Mr. Berg. “You’re a good Norwegian, and helping us.”

Mr. Berg said he tried to quit in spring 2017. But tantalized by an expenses-paid trip to glittering Moscow at Christmastime, he agreed to one last mission.

On Dec. 5, 2017, men in civilian clothes swept up Mr. Berg as he walked out of the ritzy Metropol Hotel and brought him to the offices of Russia’s spy agency — the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B.

In a wood-paneled basement conference room, the officers showed a picture of a Norwegian intelligence official who they said was in charge of Mr. Berg’s operation. Mr. Berg said, yes, he knew him. They offered more names of intelligence officials he had been in contact with, and Mr. Berg said, yes, he knew them all.

“‘We respect you, but we had to arrest you,’” one of the officers said, according to Mr. Berg. “‘We know everything.’”

After the arrest, Mr. Berg’s friends in Kirkenes were convinced he was an innocent man who had been framed by Russia or was the victim of a terrible mistake.

But realizing that his sole chance of freedom was a speedy conviction and a spy swap, Mr. Berg admitted a few months later, through his lawyers, that he had worked as a courier — shocking his supporters who thought he was innocent and had hung a “Help Frode Come Home!” banner in the Kirkenes main square.

“When you are a border citizen, you have to act like a border citizen,” said one of those supporters, the Kirkenes pastor Torbjorn Brox Webber. That means “not to get so involved with the intelligence service.”

Spy Swap

Mr. Berg said he was treated much better than other inmates at Moscow’s Lefortovo Prison, where he spent his two years behind bars. He watched TV, became a fan of the Russian pop star Olga Buzova and read up on the crimes his fellow prisoners were accused of in the tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets, delivered daily to his cell.

He counted 14 meetings with counterintelligence officers from the F.S.B. When they asked if he wanted anything, Mr. Berg said McDonald’s. So they started bringing a McChicken sandwich, fries and Coke Zero. Afterward, he said, the officers sometimes poured him a shot of cognac.

Rather than pressing him for information, they seemed intent on showing off how much they knew, he said. They even identified the nondescript building in Kirkenes where Norway’s military intelligence held secret meetings.

At one point, the conversation got so friendly, Mr. Berg recalled, that one officer told him: “‘Frode, don’t forget. I’m the investigator and you’re sitting in prison. You’re a spy.’”

In trying to secure Mr. Berg’s release, Norway’s government faced an obstacle: Its prisons had no Russian spies to trade. Eventually, its NATO ally Lithuania, which was holding two Russians on espionage convictions, agreed to a three-way deal.

On the way to the airport in Moscow, the four-car F.S.B. convoy carrying Mr. Berg and the two Lithuanian prisoners to freedom made a stop. It was at a McDonald’s.

Back on home soil in November, Mr. Berg told Norwegian journalists that the F.S.B. had named others who, unknown to him, had supposedly worked for Norwegian intelligence.

The comment jolted Rune Rafaelsen, the mayor of Kirkenes: “I thought, ‘Who is that?’”

Mr. Rafaelsen said he has “chosen not to look behind my shoulder” and question whether his neighbors are spies. Others are less certain.

Distrust, they said, has become unavoidable in the wake of the Berg case, especially as rumors fly about more undercover officers and other recruitment attempts. 

“Let them recruit their people elsewhere,” said Willy Bangsund, a wrestling coach who said he had turned down cooperation requests from Norwegian intelligence.

Norwegian intelligence agents, Mr. Bangsund and others said, had become overzealous in trying to recruit locals to help them gain information about Russia, putting at risk their efforts to deepen economic and cultural ties with their neighbor to the east.

As a result, few in Kirkenes praised Mr. Berg for undertaking a high-risk mission in the name of national security. Rather, they said, he should have understood what he was getting into, and that fellow Norwegians may face greater suspicion when they travel to Russia as a result.

“There was no pistol at his head,” Mr. Rafaelsen said, referring to Mr. Berg’s decision to cooperate with Norwegian intelligence. “I don’t think the pressure was so hard that he couldn’t have said no.”

A parliamentary committee is investigating possible wrongdoing in Mr. Berg’s case, though the government hasn’t publicly confirmed links between him and the military intelligence service. Norway’s Defense Ministry, which oversees the service, declined interview requests, as did the prime minister’s office.

“For 70 years Norway, has pursued a balanced, pragmatic and transparent approach of deterrence and dialogue toward Russia,” the state secretary of defense, Tone Skogen, said in a statement.

Mr. Berg says he takes no pride in his clandestine missions and two years in prison in the service of his country.

“It’s not for me to be a spion,” Mr. Berg said, using the Norwegian, and Russian, word for spy. “A hero? I don’t feel like this.”",Russia,/r/europe/comments/eh2nsm/norwegian_spy_jailed_by_russia_is_free_hes_angry/fccoim8/,sorrymak,1577600781

503,"For people out of the loop - ""Przemyśl"" also means ""think it over"" in Polish.

&amp;nbsp;

It sparked a pretty funny meme back in the day, because near Przemyśl there's a little town called Jarosław. Poland's governing party leader's name is also Jarosław (he's pretty disliked, some people say he basically runs the country). So somewhere along some highway in Eastern Poland is a sign saying [""Jarosław, think this through.""](http://paczaizm.pl/content/wp-content/uploads/jaroslaw-przemysl-tablica-nazwy-miast-napis.jpg)


It's not as funny cause it's not gramatically correct, but it turns out the road leading to Jarosław and Przemyśl goes further, to an little border town right by the Ukrainian border, Medyka. As you have probably noticed, this sound really close to the word ""medic"", which is basically the same in Polish. So somebody noticed a sign that said [""Przemyśl Medyka Jarosław""](https://twitter.com/krzysztofkrol/status/998536357592162304?s=20) which, if you really try, could be interpreted as ""Think about getting a doctor, Jarosław.""

Austria is actually pretty good in that regard, because we get most of our electrical power from hydropower from the Danube ([see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_Austria)).

&gt; This is also not even taking into account that many immigrants want and do bring families with them and some parties do not discourage that.

It's not really relevant for sustainability whether those immigrants know each other or not.

&gt; Not every immgirant's living conditions improve

Depends on where they came from. If they don't improve, they made the wrong decision to move to Austria, because that's kinda the point of immigration.

&gt; with automation they're going to be poorer than the average

Some of them are highly skilled and others are young enough to become highly skilled. I personally know someone who came as an asylum seeker to Austria a few years ago and now has completed catering training, so he's now earning quite well and paying into the system.

For example I grew up in a forest and the roads to my house were mostly dirt so my dad just said F it, and bought an old and cheap Nissan Patrol so that we wouldn't have to constantly dig ourselves out of dirt and snow. The dirt roads next to my house were something else so they required the big guns, even for Latvia the roads where and still are absolutely undrivable with most cars.

1153,"Mhm, generally I'm inclined to agree, but I'd also point out that - barring an isolationist policy - a country's foreign engagements are also a reflection of its ideals. There's just the possibility that an individual country's government has been undermined by influential lobbies, to the point where publicly stated ideals clash with backroom interests.

Barring this risk - which in a democracy would be the electorate's responsibility to fix - I'd say that ideals and interests are not just intertwined, but that one often informs the other. An example off the top of my head would be Germany still being comparatively reluctant in terms of arms exports, even though naked egoism should dictate maximum exports for economic gain. Or, for an EU initiative, the GDPR and its massively increased privacy protections for the individual citizen, to name just one of thousands of regulations that helped increase metrics across a variety of lifestyle sectors.

So, in a way I should have perhaps phrased my previous post differently, and pointed out that ""friendship"" can be an interest itself. Diplomacy does not have to be a zero sum game, after all. The very idea of the EU is built around the idea of the whole being stronger together than an individual country by itself, and policies such as the [ENP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Neighbourhood_Policy) exist to help spread [European progressive values](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf) beyond its borders, trading economic assistance for reforms. Admittedly a somewhat imperialist attitude, but it's what global players do, and subjectively speaking I am convinced of aforementioned values being capable of improving everyones' lives.

In a way, even your example about the (rather brief) US-China cooperation in the 80s supports this relationship between ideals and interests, as it was purely the clash of ideals that pitted the US and the Soviets against one another, and cooperating with China against Russia was likely regarded as the lesser evil.

""Contrary to popular myth, there are speed limits on the autobahn. While there are still a few stretches of autobahn where it is legal to put the pedal to the metal and drive at top speed, those sections are limited, and growing more limited by the year. While it may be legal, it may not be wise. You will also see square blue signs with white numbers reading “130” in Germany. That means 130 km/h (80 mph), the recommended top speed on the German autobahn (and the legal maximum speed on motorways in most European countries). The legal speed limit is a black number on a round white sign outlined in red (see sign images below). Sometimes there are also overhead electronic signs indicating the speed limit and warnings. Many autobahn sections have limits of 120 km/h (75 mph), 110 km/h (68 mph) or lower, especially in urban areas. Germany uses unmarked police cars and automated roadside radar/photo devices that take pictures of violators. Yes, you will see scofflaws who blatantly exceed the posted limit, but it can be expensive if you join them and get caught.""

Ye it didn't, but you calling Soviet Union - ""Russia"" sends clear massage, that you don't give as shit about Belarusians and Ukrainians living there.

&gt;So you support annexation of Crimea by Russian Federation because Crimea is mostly populated by Russians.

Different times, irrelevant comparison. 

&gt;That's a complete lie, because Poland did not consider itself part of Russian empire and declared independence in 1917.

Well Russia considered Poland part of empire and did so for previous centuries, trying to eradicate Polish language and culture, crushing every rebellion, so how is it relevant, what Poland considered herself as.

&gt;Sure, Polish-German handshakes after invasion of Czechoslovakia are ""meaningless diplomatic acts"" while Soviet-German handshakes are evil handshakes. Poland good Russia bad. That's argumentation of a child. Or Hilary Clinton.

Ye maybe I worded it badly. I am still ashamed for some actions of Polish government, but by no means they were responsible for starting war. On the other hand. Soviet Union was very much responsible for starting conficts with imperialistic ambitions.

1236,"The reasons are quite apparent from my western European point of view. 

Europian Union grew quite fast. And there is/was a big populistic backlash against the failed immigration from the 70's which did all not integrate very well,. Couple that with the current asylum/migration crisis.

At the same time there have major problems with asylum seekers,  very cheap labor and, a lot, a lot of criminals from  Romenia and Bulgaria a lot. 

I am sorry to say, but being a Romenian or Bulgar is almost a synonym for a criminal. Because when they are in the news, it's always about waves of criminals and a Romenian/Bulgar gang, or fraud network being catched. That doesn't really do any favors for the rest of their countries.

And Poland and Hungary, and even Czechia are having some extremely bad developments politically seen from a progressive liberal western point of view. Consensus has been that it went to fast for some of those nations, and they are not stable at all. Or should not be part of, should never have been part of, the 'enlightened progressive liberal' union. 

So current politicians do not want to estrange that part of their voters which are leaning to a populistic vote. Which they would by pushing for the uptake of countries into the EU which are not liked by those voters.

And the union itself doesn't really want to take in more troubles than it already has by inviting politically unstable countries. Because once they are in, they are in.",,/r/europe/comments/egodyo/map_of_the_schengen_area_explained/fc8gxto/,Lizzebed,1577534663

&gt;The proportion of reported [hate crimes](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/hate-crime) being prosecuted has plummeted from a quarter to less than one in 10 in the past six years, *The Independent* can reveal.

&gt;Despite attacks reported to police more than doubling to [a record of 103,400](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/hate-crimes-england-wales-lgbt-rise-anti-gay-transgender-attacks-a9156291.html)  in the same period, the number of suspects charged has been steadily  falling to just 9,500 in 2018-19, according to an analysis of Home  Office and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) figures.  
&gt;  
&gt;Prosecutors blame the drop on police, who have been referring fewer cases to be considered for charges.  
&gt;  
&gt; Official figures show the number of hate crimes [recorded by police in England and Wales has hit a new record ](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/hate-crimes-england-wales-lgbt-rise-anti-gay-transgender-attacks-a9156291.html)after rising from 44,500 in 2013-14 to 103,379 last year.   
&gt;  
&gt; But the number of cases passed on to prosecutors has dropped from more  than 14,000 to 11,800 – seeing the rate plummet from 31 per cent of  reported incidents to just 11 per cent.

There were actually plenty of [Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Church_in_the_Middle_East) (eg Venetians, Genoese and Armenians) and Armenian Apostolics in Constantinople, Western coastal Anatolia and Cilicia before 1916.

Nakhijevan was not totally devoid of Armenians by 1916 - they were still almost half - the main decimation was more from 1918 until 1930 and then slowly until 1990.

There were hundreds of thousands of Armenians in Baku until 1990.  At times they were up to a third of the total population.

I don't think Bessarabia, Crimea, Cyprus, Corfua and Sarajevo were straight Eastern Orthodox ca 1900 either.

Rabiej replies: ""Go to hell, there is your place""

During the Christmas conversation on right-wing TV Republic, Archbishop Marek Jędraszewski again spoke about LGBT people, and also found a new enemy - Greta Thunberg, a teenager working to stop the effects of a climate disaster. Paweł Rabiej, Vice President of Warsaw, answered Jędraszewski's words.

&amp;#x200B;

Archbishop Marek Jędraszewski did not give up on holidays. Talking with right-wing Television Republika, he once again spoke about LGBT people and criticized ... the fight against the effects of a climate disaster.

&amp;#x200B;

Jędraszewski surprised by the reaction to the words about the ""rainbow plague""

""I didn't expect such a campaign""

&amp;#x200B;

According to the metropolitan of Krakow, ""ecologicalism is a return to Engels"", and Greta Thunberg's activities related to the fight for the future of life on Earth are contrary to the teaching of the Catholic Church.

&amp;#x200B;

Jędraszewski said: ""This phenomenon is very dangerous, because it is not just a teenager figure. It is something that is imposed on us, and this activist becomes the oracle for all political and social forces.""

&amp;#x200B;

In turn, LGBT people spoke in the context of equality curriculum in schools: ""There is no greater harm done to children.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He added: ""Some things are imposed on them and depraved from preschool age, against the knowledge and consent of their parents. It deprives them of the purity of their hearts, innocence, what we read as the most profound message of the Lord Jesus. It turns out that there are people and forces interested in not they were children with their innocence. Someone wants them to be depraved. This is harm done to the whole society now and for the future. ""

&amp;#x200B;

The disclosed archbishop of Warsaw, Paweł Rabiej, revealed the words of the archbishop, writing on Twitter: ""From the perspective of Australia affected by fire, where today I can say one thing. **There is no worse plague in the civilized world today than those who question the need to care for our planet and its protection.

Mainly because the wealth of a county, it's economy isn't ending up in the hands of one dude, it's redistributed (in one places better, some worse) back to people. To the average folk. In a form of healthcare, infrastructure, education etc. China problem is that there is actually not that much to redistribute compared to amount of people it has to be given back.

You gonna say that okay dude, but US has twice GDP per capita of that in EU (The US population has reached 328 million in 2018, whereas the EU population has reached 511 million). Well, it's a question of redistributing the wealth. US has pretty bad record of it, and continues to do so.

1935,"&gt;The EU budget of 1% is already a huge number. So cuts to the EU budget after UK leaves is what is needed.

The EU budget is far too small already considering the EU is moving towards an ever closer union and has already adopted some of the aspects of a state (citizenship, currency, foreign relations etc). 

The EU really needs a much larger budget to be able to make transfer payments from richer areas to poorer. Within a state those are usually in excess of 10% of GDP. For example, the UK transfers about £5,000 per person to NI, £4,000 to Wales, £2,000 to Scotland. The top ten receiving states in the US get transfers of $5,000 - $10,000 per person. 

In comparison, the largest net recipients of EU funding get around 400 euros per person.

2035,"The major problem with that is that a lot of those views are based on the assumption that nothing in the rest of the world is changing, beyond the UK leaving the EU and Scotland leaving the UK to remain in the EU.

The world *around* the UK is changing, particularly in the relationship between the EU and the US. We're entering a potential reality where you can't really ""bridge"" between the two blocs; trade relations with the US is going to be predicated on being in the orbit of the US, and that means *not* being in the EU.

One of the points brought up is the export of Scottish Whiskey, valued at 5.5 billion GBP. What they fail to mention is that 30-35% of that market is *just* the US, and that's without any trade deals with the US (as it would have to be negotiated via the EU, which is a no-go for the US as we hate dealing with the EU, hence why there is no US-EU trade deal at all). Getting pulled into the USMCA's orbit means they'd easily be able to increase exports to the US.

They also bring up the North Sea Oil...but not only is it not *at all* a given that they'd be able to get that oil from the UK...they can't economically extract that oil anyway. Oceanic oil is expensive to extract and process, and as a result most of the offshore wells worldwide are offline right now; they can't compete with the low prices brought on by US Shale oil production, and US shale is not going anywhere as it's a massive boost to US security.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/eg9vuo/taking_back_control_brexit_edition/fc6bz21/,r3dl3g,1577477014

Very true, yet irrelevant

There was no “latinization” whatsoever. 

It is also important to point up that no linguistical “purge” of whatever forms, words, expressions has ever taken place. This too is an invention.

What really happened was a vigorous lexical modernization, as vigorous as the modernization of the Romanian society in the XIX century. This modernization took place through massive lexical borrowings from French, in order to acquire the lexical tools necessary for the new modern era. This is a common phenomenon in many societies: up to our days modernization of certain societies comes along massive lexical borrowings and renewal.

The Romanian elite of the XIX century was heavily ""francizised"" so that the massive French borrowings were initiated by the francophone elites and absorbed by the population at large in a process which lasted three generations and was - out of many reasons - politically convenient and culturally compatible with the then Romanian society aspiring to modernity.

In no possible way was this lexical modernization linked to whatever ideology of “latinization”, which actually didn't ever exist in Romania (except some academic debates in Transylvania).

Linguistical changes cannot be somehow ordered or organized from top to bottom, since language is a living social phenomenon impossible to control or constrain, even more so in a deeply rural society with 80% analphabetes, like Romania of the XIXth century.

If many old Romanian words have lost their position, this is due to the reduced use of these words against the background of modernization and not because these words have been deliberately pushed out of the language. In this process of lexical modernization, especially words of the traditional rural way of life became obsolete, perhaps more Slavic than Latin, but this was a spontaneous and not an organised development.",,/r/europe/comments/eg8q6y/ahead_of_uk_election_conservatives_pledge_to/fc5e37p/,RomanianDOC,1577454826

The last decades of Russian Empire were economically very good for Estonia, due to mass industrialization and the vast Russian market. That also made the collapse of the empire rather painful. The economy truly recovered only by late 1930s.

1. India is a secular country- hence Muslims already in India are protesting that their people also get citizenship faster. 
2. North East India  is protesting that it should not be used a dumping ground for immigrants. Because immigrants are being settled in North East.
3. People are worried that combined with NRC, this act may reject the citizenship claim of any citizen. It has to be addressed and as usual Indian government being the shitty slow government it is. It is taking it's sweet time to make an amendment.

Anyway, I don't know about this guy but if you think a new president from the opposition will let out Gulenists, you're sorely delusional. Gulenists hurt Turkey's opposition and Kurds much more than he could hurt Erdogan. Gulen fled the country in 1990s when Erdogan was also arrested by the former government and military and although FBI objected him being granted a green card, two long time CIA employees George Fidas and Graham Fuller and former US ambassador to Turkey Abramowitz endorsed him and helped him get a US green card.   
   
Gulen is a US asset, his network of ""Moderate Islamist schools"" in many former Soviet republics in the east (Turkic republics) Russia, Iran  and elsewhere helped CIA operate in those countries as ""teachers"" or ""educational staff""; his schools are eventually banned in Russia, Iran, Azerbaijan, even Saudi Arabia and many other countries for ""operating as fronts for CIA"". He also has schools operating in the US. He's got thousands of loyal followers everywhere, including justice department, education department, ministry of interior affairs, police department (especially police intelligence), media, press, military and pretty much every key office in the country.  In fact he and Erdogan used to be partners and his organization helped Erdogan take a stronghold and secure his regime by arresting hundreds of people including high ranking key military officers, opinion leaders and prominent journalists, prosecutors and judges, high ranking police and intelligence officers, leaders of nationalist organizations, pretty much anyone who can pose a threat to Erdogan's regime on trumped up charges of ""planning a coup"", ""attempting to overthrow the government"" and ""espionage"" with fake/planted evidence and tried them in special courts where defendants didn't have usual rights to defend themselves. You can read Ergenekon and Sledgehammer cases in Turkey for more information.   
   
It was when Erdogan began ""getting out of line"" with the West that prosecutors affiliated with his organization went after him and his intelligence officers and that's when their partnership ended. After the failed coup attempt, they were declared ""terrorists"" but they were already ""terrorists"" for the rest of Turkey for a long time, including those people who worked as ""journalists"" in the media for them, even before Erdogan so no future government, especially if from opposition will pardon Gulenists. Talk to any Turkish liberal, they'll tell you that those people deserve to rot in prison. So many of those people will stay in prison for life, unless the state brings back the death penalty (an idea which also has massive popular support in Turkey)",,/r/europe/comments/eg8lfy/turkey_keeps_rights_activist_jailed_despite/fc52yuq/,urbanjihad,1577440429

The situation begins to change around 1200. The patronymic then ceases to form from the father's name, instead the name of a relative who had the same combination of name and patronymic is chosen.

Yeah I did and we can more or less both condemn them for that. However, the large majority of them aren't a threat to international and peace and security.

&gt;Or those with some principles and understanding of history.

My principle is - don't feel bad for what happens to dictators. And I think I understand history pretty well, perhaps just not your version of it.

&gt;Although it's not really different when compared to any other empire.

Lol, and you claim to understand history...

&gt;Funny thing that. They don't prosecute them.

Now that is just a lie. Of course we can find cases, where we could conclude that they haven't properly done that, but to say that they don't do that on principle is just a fable lie.

No, you didn't get it. The bill doesn't say the US president has the obligation to take all means necessary... That's why I said that you are inventing facts.

&gt;That would include war if the country in question weren't receptive to other methods. I mean, it isn't called ""Hague invasion act"" for nothing, you know.

Sensationalist people come up with such sensationalist nicknames and of course they will stick in colloquial use...

3. Countries with strong union movements often have chronic high unemployment (France) or insane youth/old age employment gaps (Italy).

I am not saying that a strong social market approach in which unions are equal partners to employers (a la Scandinavia) cannot do wonders, but that is difficult to replicate in countries without a tradition of having a social market system.

And regardless of all these, Spain still has the problem of having both a large (and rapidly increasing) population of retirees AND a large population of uneducated youth.

I act like US invaded a country, destroyed it, and left it a complete mess. 

&gt;I think that you're the naive one here with blaming the US for every conflict. 

I don't blame them for ""every"" conflict. I blame them for conflicts they are responsible for.

&gt; However, the large majority of them aren't a threat to international and peace and security. 

Oooh, so it's ok to support dictators if you they're not a ""threat to peace and security"". Got ya. Though remind me, how did Saddam threaten peacy and security exactly? I seem to have forgotten. 

&gt;My principle is - don't feel bad for what happens to dictators. And I think I understand history pretty well, perhaps just not your version of it. 

So what you're saying is that hundreads of thousands of dead is perfectly fine price for you to be able to gloat about some dead dictator? 

And given that you defend Iraq war of all things, i doubt you understand much at all.

&gt;Now that is just a lie. Of course we can find cases, where we could conclude that they haven't properly done that, but to say that they don't do that on principle is just a fable lie. 

Literally every single post-WW2 US president is a war criminal. None of them prosecuted. Every major crime US committed since the war, there has been almost no consequences for anyone. Obama, the liberal ""hero"" that he was, refused to prosecute Bush era torturers and genocidal maniacs like Cheney. You are utterly delusional if you think US prosecutes those kinds of crimes.

&gt;You seem to be obsessed with him... You do know he's not some enlightened academic though, right? 

Except he's literally that. A world renowned scientist and one of the biggest intellectuals of our time. Who presents you with facts. Facts you completely ignore because you choose to believe the propaganda you've been fed.

&gt;Good, they supported the only chance at democracy Russia got during the last few centuries.. 

Honestly, what an ignorant, hypocritical piece of shit you are. This ""democracy supporting"" is what led to Putin, you ignorant fuck. That and American economists spearheading mass privatization of the late 90s that created all the oligarchs. 

It is always so astonoshing seeing people like you. The hypocrisy of crying about Russian interference and then defending the very same interference against Russia is mind boggling.

I dont see that at all. China and Russia are both fairly isolated, they cant start a world war in the first place. The only lasting military alliance atm is NATO. This isnt the cold war, where you got a massive power block like the warsaw pact to oppose NATO; russia doesnt even have as much manpower available as the west, let alone the money, technology or professional troops. 

&gt;I think we will not see Russia as a threat for world peace until they conquer Poland.

And you know what stops Russia from ever conquering Poland? The EU and NATO, which would indeed set half the worlds military to conquer Russia.

So one of the first things necessary to allow that would be to remove EU and NATO, and Trump can at least do one of those things. In that regard, he has at least the potential to threaten future conflicts, which most other countries dont have.

***Robert Kasiak*** *- Polish language teacher from Radom*

""Have you heard that the LGBT offensive is underway?"" Daniel asks me.

""And where did you see this offensive?"" - I answer with a question.

He: ""On Żeromskiego (main street of Radom) I saw three LGBTs!""

I was completely unaware that we were at war. If it wasn't for Daniel, whom I try to teach in one of Radom schools, maybe I wouldn't know. Yes, I must admit that creating an opponent in the form of LGBT is the greatest achievement of TVP and environments close to golden-eyed, concerned inquisitors with tasteful flags in the lapels of jackets.

This is an undeniable success that can be compared only with the well-known radio play of Orson Welles based on the ""War of the Worlds"". Bringing a non-existent enemy to life and causing panic on such a scale is a propaganda masterpiece.

&gt;**A lot of young people are really afraid of LGBT, although they don't know what it is.**",,/r/europe/comments/eg5xds/lgbt_offensive_on_ul_żeromski_proof_that_teachers/fc4jy50/,bm52oc,1577418855
2754,"Of course Germany would side with their wallets and then try and shame anyone who questions that they are the paragons of morality. 

Russia is an existential threat to most of eastern europe, supposedly German allies. Yet they chose to pontificate on environmentalism and close their power plants, making themselves dependent on Russian gas, because you can't heat millions of homes on solar, wind and wishful thinking. So they had to buy gas, and had the choice of russia or the US. they chose to save a few euros and enrich the greatest military threat to everyone east of them. On top of that, the oragemann had the gall to ask them to pay their share in NATO, something even Poland and Romania can do. 

This is the country that decided to send their professional military forces to an international training exercise armed with **literal brooms** in order to save a few euros. This is not an [exageration, or a joke](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11420627/German-army-used-broomsticks-instead-of-guns-during-training.html)

And they talk about ""threats to world peace"". When someone was starting wars all over the world, he was declared the Messiah in Germany because he was on their side of the political spectrum as it relates to the nationalism/globalism axis.

2756,"## Daniel is no exception

Criticism of the environments referred to as LGBT is a clear example, but TVP creates and consolidates assessments relating to all persons, groups and environments uncomfortable for power. Opponents disturb, harm and care for the interests of strangers. In addition, they are not real patriots. For example, on December 9, I learned from ""Wiadomości"" that if someone has a critical opinion on the merger of two Gdansk companies, they do not want a strong Poland. This is a new understanding of patriotism

November 19 2017

It is not naturally that young people watch news sites with baked goods on the face and accept the truth revealed there. Rather, he unwittingly accepts the opinions of people from his environment. Daniel is no exception.

We may not believe, ridicule, deny, contest, or simply not watch TVP. However, this does not change the painful truth that Jacek Kurski's television has a huge, probably the biggest, influence on shaping Poles' opinions and views.

## Deadly TVP

Television lies, reverse meanings, contempt and manipulation is a poison given to the public. This is intellectual murder. In addition, unpunished, because probably in 10 years or 20 years few people will remember about the current level of hypocrisy of reality, and its effects will remain. I do not intend here, apart from the modest examples above, to even prove that TVP is only a propaganda tool. This can be done on the example of a randomly selected issue, the so-called Messages. My goal is completely different. Much more serious and relevant.

### ""Major Bauman will not pass in Poland."" We supplement TVP's ""News"" material

January 12 2017

I want to give young people the possibility of an independent and not imposed choice. I want students to believe what they see and hear. So that they do not have to wonder how much the deformed picture of the world is conveyed to them by an institution that, in principle, should be objective.

If we don't react as a society, media pathology will become the norm. No one will require the media, until recently obvious, objectivity or independence. It is already common belief that there is no place in politics for transparency and truthfulness. And the media are clearly associated with politics. The choice between TVP and TVN has long been not a choice between comparable ""products"". This is a political choice, and often a worldview.

As a teacher, I'm terrified. I go out to the students with Herbert, Miłosz and Szymborska and they come to me with TVP message. I am about values, and students about imaginary threats or nonexistent successes.

Young people unreflectively repeat nonsense about the LGBT and feminist offensive, and worse, anti-Polish Olga Tokarczuk. How to convince them to get acquainted with the assessment of modernity and the meaning of the stories from the Nobel Prize winner's speech, if for some recipients he is a ""suspect"" for various reasons? It doesn't matter that perhaps this is one of the most important non-literary texts of recent years. The author's criticism outweighs the depth and wisdom of the conclusions.

## Can't do anything?

I wondered where the end of this media paranoia and how to stop it. I see only one solution.

We teachers must talk about propaganda, manipulation, contempt, hate, hate speech and all such threats exclusively on the example of TVP materials. In principle, we are obliged to do so by the core curriculum. This is not even a Herbertian matter of taste. It is our duty.

All you have to do is refer to the [reports of the Polish Language Council](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=pl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/Druki8ka.nsf/0/C4B224C28DB9367BC12583CB0032CA99/%2524File/3324.pdf&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700256,15700259,15700262,15700265,15700271,15700283&amp;usg=ALkJrhjp-csMXauOSFaRbRS7E3MzSknnAA) (from April 3 and May 29) about manipulations on the ""News"" information bars (according to the May report, 75% of 306 bars did not serve as information, but persuasive and creative) and the core curricula .

### 14 seconds of the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity, 83 seconds of Kaczyński. The head of TVP's ""breaking news"" broke the law

January 16, 2017

According to the entry of the general education core curriculum for high school and technical college:

* every teacher should pay a lot of attention to media education, i.e. educating students to properly receive and use the media.

And further for the purposes of education in the Polish language:

* Developing skills to understand the role of the media and their impact on people's behavior and attitudes, as well as the critical reception of media messages and the conscious use of them.
* Building a system of values ​​on the foundation of truth, goodness and beauty, and respect for man.

And in the detailed content of education, the student:

* distinguishes between the concepts of manipulation, misinformation, post-truth, stereotype, information bubble, virtualization; recognizes these phenomena in texts and characterizes them;

In primary school, the teacher's task is, among others:

* shaping independence in reaching information, developing the ability to select them, critically assess and use in their own development;

In the course of social studies, the student:

In primary school:

* presents the functions and types of mass media; explains the importance of mass media for free speech;
* finds news in the media on a given topic; distinguishes information about facts from comments and opinions; explains what the reliability of journalists should be about;

In high school:

* critically analyzes media messages; explains the basic manipulation mechanisms used in the media; points out the role of the Media Ethics Council in the Republic of Poland;
* gives examples of power control by the media; analyzes - on modern examples - cases of limiting media rights; explains the role of the National Broadcasting Council in the Republic of Poland; shows that the level of media criticism often depends on their political orientation;",,/r/europe/comments/eg5xds/lgbt_offensive_on_ul_żeromski_proof_that_teachers/fc4k5f6/,bm52oc,1577419030

Finland's 6th 1600MW nuclear plant will be ready mid next year. Construction of the 7th reactor is starting 2021 and will be constructed by Rosatom. 

It just sounds to me Polish people should be rioting for their government to do something if the acceptance of nuclear is as positive as everybody says here. Poland is economically much larger than Finland and manufacturing one reactor should be easy. You don't need Germany to hold your hand to do so. Countries shouldn't be that dependent on hand outs from EU in any case. 

I mean Poland is still by far the biggest beneficiary of EU monetary wise. Finland is a net payer and this whole topic even with two 10 billion euro reactors being build this decade the whole EU hand out hasn't even been a topic in Finland.

2903,"&gt;I don’t know why the EU is passing resolutions like blaming the USSR etc - time to let sleeping dogs lie instead of bringing up the ugly past. They suffered tens of millions dead and destruction on an unimaginable scale. Many other countries were guilty of appeasing and cosying up to Hitler before the war.

Many of those tens of millions were killed either indirectly or directly because of how the Kremlin acted. And because Russia is aggressively and violently attacking its neighbours, among them some of their former subjects who suffered far worse, while pretending like they liberated Europe from Nazism and appropriating all the losses and suffering of said subjects whom they are now attacking, these resolutions are necessary.

&gt;WW2 has many reasons to blame. The Germans must take the vast majority of the responsibility for the war in Europe.

And they do.

3030,"A few years ago, I stumbled upon the subreddit ABraThatFits, where people share their struggle to find a bra and pass along what they have learned. While scrolling through the forum, I often came across a specific piece of advice: go Polish.

&amp;#x200B;

The Redditors mentioned a few brands in particular, Ewa Michalak and Comexim, but there are 47 companies listed on their “Polish guide.” As it turns out, lingerie experts and enthusiasts hold a special reverence for bras made in Poland, and a growing number of boutiques in the United States carry them.

&amp;#x200B;

Laura Henny, the owner of the Rack Shack, a boutique on Central Avenue in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, gets calls every week about whether she stocks Ewa Michalak bras.

&amp;#x200B;

She herself wears Ewa Michalak bras most of the time. “They’re extremely comfortable, and I just really like the shape that they give,” Ms. Henny said.

&amp;#x200B;

Tina Omer, the owner of Aphrodite’s Closet in San Antonio, said she wears mostly Nessa, another Polish brand, and stocks Nessa and Ewa Michalak in her shop.

&amp;#x200B;

Both proprietors praise these brands’ materials and the construction. Most Polish bras, even those made by larger manufacturers, are still designed and constructed in Poland by hand, with fabrics and laces from Italy and Spain.

And unlike in the United States, where confusion and misinformation abound about bands and cups, care is taken with sizing. Many Polish designers follow the principles of “brafitting” (in Poland, one word), which begins with the idea that regardless of whether your breasts are small or large, simply measuring across and under the bust will not produce a bra that fits.

&amp;#x200B;

Grade Inflation

To understand Polish bras, you first need to understand brafitting. The practice originated in Britain, and it’s touted and heatedly discussed by an online community of frustrated bra shoppers, fitters and manufacturers scattered around the world.

&amp;#x200B;

The fundamental tenet of brafitting is that the band of a bra — the number in someone’s bra size — provides most of the support, and in many cases should be smaller than what standard sizing methods spit out.

&amp;#x200B;

There is plenty of technical terminology (my breasts are not “saggy” but “pendulous”). And, of course, community spats spring up (“Strapgate”).

One basic agreement among brafitters? American bras, for the most part, don’t fit.

&amp;#x200B;

“When I see the underwear in the U.S., even in the movies, it’s a disaster for me,” said Agnieszka Jablonska, a brafitter trained in Britain who works in sales for the Polish brand Samanta.

&amp;#x200B;

For a long time I thought I was a 36C because that’s what they told me at Victoria’s Secret. When I entered five (!) measurements into a calculator that approximates brafitting principles, created by the Reddit folks, it said I was a 32F.

&amp;#x200B;

Producing a wide size range is complicated and expensive, so companies producing bras for big chains avoid it. Many American brands — with notable exceptions, like Rihanna’s line Savage x Fenty — only go up to D, DD or DDD cups.

&amp;#x200B;

But brafitters say that D cups, when properly fit, are for breasts generally perceived to be small, and that many women wearing them might prefer the fit of E, F, G, or H cups (and beyond). If someone at a chain store measures you and says you’re a DD cup, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you have enormous breasts, they say — it might just be that DD is the biggest size the store has, and they want to sell it to you. The brafitting community is leery of Big Bra. The cultural notion that D cups are big is actually just a quirk of industrial production, and decisions by individual companies to increase margins wherever possible.

In 2008, Julia Krysztofiak-Szopa started an online Polish discussion forum “bra community” called Balkonetka. Thousands of women posted detailed reviews and photos of their bras.

&amp;#x200B;

A few years later, she moved from Warsaw to Palo Alto, Calif. When she looked for bras in her size, 34HH, at Macy’s and Nordstrom, she found that nearly all of them stopped at D.

&amp;#x200B;

So Ms. Krysztofiak-Szopa started ordering her bras from Poland. For several years, she and her sister sold bras made by Comexim to American women, through a company they started called Wellfitting.

&amp;#x200B;

“I thought, this is really weird — supposedly the largest economy in the world, with a massive consumer market, massive shopping malls, and they have no freakin’ D plus bras,” she said. “And Americans don’t have a tiny frame, at the end of the day. So I was very surprised to see there is something off about how American brands treat their consumers, trying to lock them into just four sizes, and trying to tell women that if they do not fit, there’s something off about them.”",,/r/europe/comments/eg1jx7/the_best_bras_might_be_made_in_poland/fc3ryw7/,bm52oc,1577397124

On a recent trip to Poland, I decided to see whether I could find the perfect bra, and find out for myself why the ones made there are said to be so special.

&amp;#x200B;

I began my quest in Kazimierz, the Jewish quarter of Krakow that is now trendy, at a tiny boutique called Brafitteria. I noticed a few brafitting certifications on the wall, including some from courses by the British lingerie company Panache.

British lingerie companies were the first to produce wider size ranges. In the mid-2000s, after Poland joined the European Union, bras made by these brands made it back to Poland.

&amp;#x200B;

Local manufacturers began expanding their own size ranges about 10 years ago after pressure from online communities like Balkonekta.

After trying about 10 bras under the gentle guidance of a brafitter named Ludmila, I bought a sheer Prussian blue one with sprays of pink floral embroidery on the cups, from the brand Samanta (209 zloty, about $55). It looked like it had been tattooed onto me. (A signature of Polish bras is narrow wires and deep cups that mold closely to your body.)

&amp;#x200B;

“The Polish wire just so perfectly fits,” said Agnieszka Socha, who started the Academy of Professional Brafitting, which teaches and offers certification in the practice, in 2011. She prepped me on the basics of Polish bras before my trip. “If you just put it on the chest, it fits like somebody made it only for you. It’s not too wide — it’s just perfect.”

&amp;#x200B;

Next: the mall. I figured I had to. At Ewa Bien, a store in Galeria Kazimierz, I tried on my favorite design of dozens of bras I tried on my trip: a beige balconette with yellow and green floral embroidery, and salmon pink piping on the cups. It reminded me of a botanical drawing, and it was on sale for 158 zloty (about $40).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At another shop near the mall, the brafitter said my breasts were asymmetrical. This wouldn’t bother me, but it was never mentioned any of the other times I was measured. That shop made me tired, so I stopped at a pierogi shack before going to bed early.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning, I took a train to Lodz, Poland’s third-largest city, three hours north of Krakow. Ewa Michalak and Comexim are based there, and a lingerie trade show was happening that weekend. I wanted to see if I could find a perfect bra at the source.

&amp;#x200B;

One could call Lodz and the surrounding region the lingerie capital of Poland. During the years of the Polish People’s Republic, one government-run lingerie company in the area was a major employer. In the early 1990s, that factory broke out into hundreds of independent lingerie companies.

&amp;#x200B;

“Almost every second house did something in lingerie,” said Marzena Pudlowska, the co-owner of KrisLine, founded in 1992. KrisLine is one of few companies that managed to survive past that period — in part, Ms. Pudlowska thinks, because of its decision to respond to consumers by expanding its size range.

&amp;#x200B;

New designers like Ewa Michalak and Comexim had the perfect ingredients to make bras with a global reputation: makers with decades of experience, access to high-quality materials and a willingness to produce bras that fit pretty much everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There are no fluffy couches at the Ewa Michalak factory. Once in the fitting room, you will be asked to take off everything on top, and bend over at a 90 degree angle. You’ll be measured with your bare breasts hanging toward the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Continue reading the main story

&amp;#x200B;

About 100 women visit the factory every month for this experience, coming from as far as Canada and Australia. The designer has a reputation for engineering some of the best-fitting bras in the world, particularly for larger breasts.

&amp;#x200B;

Ms. Michalak’s cousin Gosia, who works at the company, put on latex gloves and draped a tape measure on my back, measuring the circumference around my dangling nipples. I braced my hands on the wall for balance. The precision and awkwardness of this method gave me absolute confidence in it.

&amp;#x200B;

Ms. Michalak — long blond hair with pink ombré tips, pink high heels, cat's-eye glasses — observed from the corner, offering notes to her staff in Polish. I’m not sure what she was saying, but it sounded expert.

&amp;#x200B;

Ms. Michalak used to design lingerie at other companies, but she got bored. She started attending meet-ups of the online bra forum Lobby Biusciastych, or “Busty Lobby.”

&amp;#x200B;

There, she asked women to try on bras she had designed herself. This is how she developed her unique sizing method.

&amp;#x200B;

She explained to me that if someone has pendulous breasts, measuring while she is standing up doesn’t really tell you how much breast the bra must support. Neither does measuring someone who is already wearing a bra.

&amp;#x200B;

“With bigger and therefore heavier breasts, different technical solutions are needed for bras,” she said in Polish, with her staff helping to translate. “In fact, a whole other approach to constructing bras is in order.”

&amp;#x200B;

I had never bought a padded bra before — they never looked right — but I left with two that looked great: a tan plunge with a pearl drop in the center (about $54); and a black lace plunge with decorative straps (about $61).

&amp;#x200B;

No one needs to be reminded that there are many more important things to be concerned with than underwear. (In Poland, as in the United States.) But many women wear bras every day, and like other banal aspects of daily life, considering them in any depth can reveal subtle injustices of the market. The market determines which bodies are normal, and by extension, who is deserving of clothes that fit.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn’t find one perfect bra in Poland, but I left with five new ones that help me stand a bit taller. Before I discovered the brafitters I would often catch my reflection in a window while walking. I’d feel a little embarrassed about the excessive movement of my chest, and my hunched posture.

&amp;#x200B;

But I didn’t perceive the bras as not fitting me. I just thought that my breasts had a weird, abnormal shape.

&amp;#x200B;

Ms. Socha said that for a while, Polish bra makers looked abroad for validation, the way a woman might look to clothes to validate ideas about “normal” bodies.

3037,"&gt;What I mean by 6 is not that Poland can stop Russian army from invading Baltics. Its about NATO military strategy on the eastern flank. Documents say that NATO needs 30 days to move equipment to Poland. All the assets will be deployed behind the vistula river due to strategic reasons. If lets say Russia moves onto Baltics it all comes down to what Poland military does next. If Russian could somehow convince Poland to stay out of this war there is nothing NATO can do to help Baltics. But thats not going to happen. Because Baltics and Poland are in this together.

Agree even though the document is a bit outdated I think it was 2015 or 2016.

3091,"&gt; Are you completely out of your mind? I’ve never said any jokes about this.

What? You're going completely nuts over there, I see.

&gt;Watch your language you’re just embarrassing yourself. It is a very serious topic to me and I have pondered on this for quite some time, unlike you.

I feel bad for your brain capacity if that's what happens when you ""ponder for a while"". Some boot-tier level of cranial thinking, I shudder at the thought of the things you say or do without thinking much.

&gt;I’m calm about it because I’m not a 12 year old kid like you who jumps at other people throats on the internet.

Yeah you're calm, because you're a 12-year-old kid who jumps at dead people's - who suffered more than you will suffer in your pathetic lifestyle - throats. I guess they can't talk back, huh?

&gt;Shell shock and fraternizing with the enemy are two completely separate issues, again you keep being a lazy pig trying to fight in the mud by spreading the argument to other topic I never ever discussed with you.

That was the answer to your boot argument of ""high command treated it like treason therefore it's 100% TREASON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PRAISE HIGH COMMAND!!!!!!!!"". 

&gt; Again that’s even an argument, your just trying to take the morale high ground because you have no density in your argument.

You don't deside what is an argument and what is not.

&gt;TIL that applying battlefield thinking to a battlefield is bad!

Yes, because you're not on the fucking field of WW1. You have hindsight, you have at least basic knowledge of history and sociology. Yet you can only think in boot terms because anything more will damage your brain. 

&gt;Then some more ad hominem attacks because you have no argument to make your case, which I imagine is only due to your a deficit in either IQ or knowledge, maybe both.

Ironic.

&gt;We are polar opposites: I apply facts and logic

Every time someone uses this phrase unironically you just know they're on a two-digit IQ spectrum.

&gt;Wtf about the bigger picture your point doesn’t mean anything, no one said anything about bigger picture, and you are just spewing non sense again. Of course fighting other human beings is tough but when the lives of your brothers in arms and family have been claimed by those same enemies who want to annihilate you, tell me how **hating them makes you inhuman?!?**

It doesn't make you inhuman. People who were fighting were justified in hating them.

However, you, an unrelated person hating them a century later does make you inhuman. People like you are literally the only thing that make war possible, therefore fuck you, you fucking cunt. If you got your way, you guys would have no EU (I bet you'd love that though) and you'd just spend your short life warring with each other. Because YEAH YOUR FAMILY DIED TO THESE GUYS, YOU MUST HATE THEM AND KILL THEIR FAMILY TOO AND SO ON AND SO ON.

&gt;GODWIN POINT EVERYONE CAN GO HOME! Dude you’re a troll right? This is just plain ridiculous on so many levels. You know that calling ppl nazis isn’t an argument?

I'm not calling you a Nazi, you fucking dolt. I'm just warning you that ""you say you're tolerant but you're intolerant of my intolerance"" is a fallacy most commonly employed by them, so tread fucking lightly.

&gt;You have 0 military knowledge, stop trying to act like you know anything, it’s showing that you just suck at everything right now

Fuck your respect. Saying shit you say with a smile and pleasantries is worse than telling people like you to fuck off.

&gt;I am neither playing it hard or trying to look cool, I just reminded everyone here that this was treason, and was rightfully treated as such by the high command back then.

Bet shellshocked troops being unable to go on are also *treason*! After all, the command treated it this way, too! 

&gt;I love how you’re saying that Ukrainian fighters are fighting because it was an attempted coup so they’re justified; but me saying that ww1 soldiers were justified in fighting enemies deep into their territory is not. Double standard much?

I never actually said that defenders are in the wrong for defending. All I'm saying is a thought that echoes literally throughout the entirety of human history - that killing people doesn't actually feel nice. Even if they're ""enemy troops"". And it's not just some LiBrUl thoughts - plenty of people spiral into depression and suicide after being exemplary soldiers. 

Again, you're using a battlefield thinking outside the battlefield. It's the same as stealing glory and playing hard - real troops don't even do that, and your RPing as a commando is pathetic.

&gt;Still no counter argument in your messages about anything I said, neither about the « murderbots » nor about your flawed viewpoint that I addressed.

Thing is - we are talking in polar opposites. You're talking in wartime thoughts while other users include the bigger picture. You simply refuse to take the bigger picture into account because yes, it would be sad. It's much easier to just convince yourself the enemy side isn't even human at all so shooting them is fun. Shooting becomes harder when you see they're humans too - except for a *select few*. Don't you happen to be one of them? I'm still convinced you're an edgy kid over a sociopath because sociopaths probably wouldn't reveal their tendencies for no reason.

&gt;To end this once and for all, you come to talk to me about empathy and love and free speech and beautiful human soul, then just 4 messages later apparently I’m scum neither worthy of my job (penultimate message) nor of my opinion (last message).

""was taken by Naftogas in breach of its storage contract"" - stolen.

No, that can happen to anyone trading with anyone that is trying to steal their stuff. There has been zero problems with delivery of Russian gas since cold war. Only hickup was when Ukraine started stealing and gas supply had to be turned off. And they still managed to fulfill their contractual obligations to paying customers on time. 

&gt;That's why US sanctions are necessary to prevent this from happening.

US sanctions will prevent Russians from turning off gas supplies if you dont pay? lol good luck with that.

More expensive European countries than those are probably just Switzerland and Iceland. Pretty much everywhere\* else is cheaper.

If money is a concern at all, I suggest not travelling to these countries. There's plenty of nice things to see and do in the cheaper parts of Europe. 

Less expensive than those, but still expensive are the big cities are the UK, Ireland, France and the Netherlands. Outside of big cities they are not that expensive.

A bit less expensive than those are Spain, Germany, Austria, Italy, etc.

Less expensive than those are ex-communist countries in Central Europe like the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, etc. We can add Portugal and Greece here as well.

And the cheapest parts of Europe and the ex-communist countries, especially the Balkans (outside of Slovenia if you consider it Balkan and the coastal areas of Croatia which can be expensive) and Eastern European countries like Ukraine and Belarus. Russia too outside the two biggest cities.

Central Europe (mainly V4). **Prague**, Budapest, Warsaw... These are cheaper options. Baltic capitals are also cheap and nice, but V4 capitals have more to offer.

The Balkans are indeed cheap (well, depends where really), but they are not THAT interesting. Of course they are interesting, but if you want to make only a few stops, I would not recomment spending time there. If you really want to, then it's **Ljubljana**.

Greece is nice, not too expensive, but again, there are thousands of islands, I have no idea what you want to see... **Athens** if you decide to go there.

3243,"&gt; He came as reaction to appeasement policies, so quote is more than justified.

Doesn't change the fact that it was his country who aligned themselves with Hitler's ambitions in the first place.

&gt;I like how everything is cute and simple in your reality. I guess you don't have problem with Ribbentrop-Molotov treaty then, right?

Ribbentrop-Molotov was more of an informal alliance rather than a strict non-aggression pact that Poland was pursuing. The key difference being that the Nazis and Soviets worked together to draw up invasion plans, coordinate their efforts to invade Poland, and hosted numerous parades together in occupied cities. Poland's non-aggression pact attempt did none of that and failed miserably because the Nazis violated it and invaded Poland anyway. I like how everything is cute and simple in your reality.

&gt;See, again this poor victim talks, right after you've mentioned Hitler-Pilsudski pact and Czechoslovakia.

I mean, it was. Literally look at any interwar map.

&gt;Then support idea of collective safety, get rid of Pilsudski motto ""Let's build Great Poland (just like Great Germany, Great Italy or Suur Suomi) from sea to sea on the ruins of Russian Empire!"" and live peacefully.

Piłsudski supported the idea of collective safety via his intermarium project. He wanted alliances with neighbouring countries and eventually a large union of states.

&gt;That wasn't even remotely the case. They had clear preference of what side to take in future ""crusade against bolshevizm"".

The USSR was rapidly opposed to Poland's very existence and only saw it as a trampling ground to invade the rest if Europe. After a fighting a war of survival against them it's only logical that they would pursue friendly relations with a power that hated them less.

&gt;And what were their relationships with Poland since beginning of century? Where did polish rulers run after 39? Do you even understand the logic of what you are saying?

France and Britain bent over to Hitler's every want and whim. They allowed him to send troops to the Rhineland, annex Austria, invade and dismantle Czechoslovakia, etc. When Poland was invaded they had no choice but to observe their defensive pacts with them; not because they actually cared about Poland but because they didn't want to lose face and because they were rightfully wary of future German aggression. Even when they declared war against Germany they delayed and did nothing until late 1940 (look up the Phoney War lol), allowing Germany to wrap up the Polish front, invade a few other countries, and gather enough forces to decisively destroy the French military. 

If it wasn't for Franco-British inaction Nazism could've been killed in the crib; in that sense they were the biggest collaborators of them all.

&gt;But there was no Poland under nazi rule. And what do you mean by only?

There was no puppet government in Poland, it was ruled directly by Germany itself.

&gt;White Eagle legion or Holy Cross brigade didn't exist too?

Were they SS legions?

&gt;No collabortionism? No anti-semithism?

Didn't say there wasn't. In any case, it's no coincidence that Poles make up the majority of Righteous Amongst Nations either.

3345,"&gt; Everybody has different ideas, some don't like other europeans, some don't like the current nations themselves, like Catalunyans etc. What I'm saying is that it's not simply a choice between being completely independent in your own nation or pooling the power in a bigger european system as pooling the power may be a necessity not to depend on foreign powers

Identity isn't that much about liking though. I assume you don't actively dislike none-Europeans despite your rhetoric European and differences to the rest of the world for example.

If you don't identify as a European then other European countries are ""foreign"" too, so the the idea that it is a choice between foreign powers or not isn't really applicable. 

&gt;Some may still prefer foreign powers to europeans, but I think that most europeans have more in common with other europeans rather than with chinese or something, and the advantage of pooling the power with other europeans is that you're at least a part of it, while if you depend on a foreign power, as friendly as it can be, it will always prioritize its own interests over yours when necessary

By 800 the Pope had essentially already broken free of Constantinople and was for all intents and purposes independent.
Now, Rome had already been pretty autnonomus from the Empire since the 7th Century (the Empire was busy dealing with more pressing matters), however there was still the Exarch of Ravenna, who put checks and balances on the Pope and was the de jure secular authority over Roman Italy.

In 751 the Lombards captured Ravenna however, and the Exarchate was abolished, thereby eliminating the Exarch as a limit on the Pope's secular power.

The fall of Ravenna meant however that Rome was now the next target for the Lombards to conquer. The Empire could no longer help the Pope, so he went over to the King of the Franks, Pepin and asked him for assistance.

Pepin obliged, and donated to the Pope a large tract of land from Rome to Ravenna (basically restoring the old Exarchate of Ravenna, but now with the Pope in charge). This basically created the Papal States, and the coronation of Charlemagnee was merely a de jure confirmation of the status quo Pepin had established 44 years earlier.",Kingdom of France,/r/europe/comments/efm36w/on_this_day_december_25th_800_ad_charlemagne_was/fc2nzdw/,Anthemius_Augustus,1577368661

Given WW2 was all but inevitable and there was so much unfinished business, and continuation. Germany had the same ultimate strategy and goal of taking out Europe and Russia to secure a new reich. The US supplied money and resources. The British empire held out and depleted itself. It’s pretty samey. Yes there was tech advancement. You had planes, subs, WW2 style storm troopers, and communism by the end of WW1. They are inextricably connected.

As for your comment about peripheral war - the literally exact same thing happened between WW1 &amp; 2. Japanese imperial expansion didn’t start when they bombed pearl harbour. Ask China and Russia. 

You say there are no monuments to the 100 years war. 
&gt;Joan of Arc 
&gt;Battle of Agincourt 
Etc.
So, you’re just wrong. Going for a clean sweep! 

The bombed out church isn’t a monument to the 2nd world war. It was a monument to god. I.e. a church. It was also built befor the First World War started. 
It got bombed. It wasn’t demolished because the bell tower, outer shell, and grounds are mostly intact and of exquisite quality. The chances of it being bulldozed were nil. However, Liverpool was dirt poor for decades after, so nothing was done with it.

It hasn’t been repaired due to lack of funds and the death of the religion that made it and effectively the civilisation that made it, I.e., the present population are not interested and incapable of restoring it to its full glory and would rather build cheap single bed ‘luxury’ flats and a big new shopping centre. The church has little priority and is given the cheapest possible solution other than demolition.

To claim it is a WW2 memorial is flat out ridiculous. It wasn’t built as such. It isn’t used as hallowed ground. There isn’t a list of the names of the dead. It’s used almost every day of the year as a multi-purpose venue for literally anything. When I visit archaeological sites I don’t say ‘ah yes, this is a monument to the specific event that destroyed it. Let’s get some hippies to do yoga here and play bongos to celebrate the war dead. It’s what they would have wanted’.

Britain is gone, and unless some dramatic shift happens in their mindset and politics in the mid term or long term, it'll stay as it is. Was it good for them? Yes and no, but sure ones voted to leave the EU are going to be the ones most affected from that decision, while they won't be tacking back the control in many areas, or being exempted from EU regulations if they want to export things to the EU still, won't be having money send to evil EU to be send to NHS or arguably even see worsening and undermining of the NHS by the US, and fishermen will be crying about free-movement of the fish.

Ideal solution would be them having a status like Norway, but given Norway wouldn't be keen to accept it, it might be even Norway-minus. Not sure if Brits will be welcoming that though.

3502,"Your comparison shouldn't be ""Is Finland more relevant than Norway?"" but rather ""Is Finland in the EU more relevant than Finland outside of the EU?""

I don't know about the relevance of individual countries themselves but the EU has certainly more leverage on international politics than a bunch of small countries that negotiate individually. 3 of the countries you mentioned are quite rich mainly due to the huge amount of natural resources their export anyway, and combined with the fact that all those countries are among the least densely populated countries in the world helps with per capita data (not that it has something to do with international relevance, just FYI). I don't think New Zealand is that relevant tbh, Canada is probably the only one I'd include among the world's major players, then maybe Australia, Norway is not even in G20

If the argument is whether Finland is more relevant than those countries, I don't know, it depends on what the individual countries are doing, but Finland is certainly more relevant by being in the EU due to what I said above, the EU has quite some international leverage. If a foreign power wants to ""attack"" Finland in any way (not just militarily, there's NATO for that for now) it knows that there will be a reaction by one of the wealthiest economic areas in the world. The EU is still not perfect obviously but it's still something. Some countries may feel like there's no need for that and they can live on their own not mentioning the fact that they can do it just because of american protection for now, with no american protection they would be very vulnerable and still, the US doesn't really protect Europe against economic ""attacks"" or whatever these days, it's doing quite the opposite in some areas

A lot of nostalgic people look back at the ""good old times"" when their country was great not considering the fact that the world has evolved since then, there's no going back. European countries were world powers simply because of the technological advantage, but now the whole world has access to that and other countries, especially asian ones like China, India, Indonesia are catching up (Japan and Korea already did it) and European countries will never be world powers like in the past again. People who think that through nationalism and anti-globalism we can ""make Europe great again"" are just deluded, Europe can go back but the rest of the world has progressed in the meantime and won't go back

France, the UK and Germany are probably the only ones that are still somewhat relevant on the global stage, but even those ones heavily dependend on the US for protection for example. The future Europe as a bunch of individual countries is being under the influence of foreign powers unless it can create an influence of its own. For now it's been good (it could have been worse, and it has been in some parts of Europe until some decades ago) as we're under the influence of a somewhat free, democratic nation (US), but assuming that this will always be the case is not necessarily safe, and an overlord will always care about his own interests before anything else anyway",,/r/europe/comments/efecxe/has_something_happened_to_this_sub_lately/fc2ovfw/,Junkererer,1577369527

I'll quote some excerpts from the article: 

&gt;Nearly 13,500 refugees from Greece have been settled in their new countries so far. Most would have preferred Germany, Sweden or France, countries with flourishing immigrant populations, long histories of accepting refugees and large economies. Instead, many have been moved to **smaller, less wealthy and more homogenous** countries like Estonia in an effort to fairly distribute the burden across the E.U. The result is a grand social experiment in which families like Iyman’s are thrust, unprepared, into alien cultures with little experience of outsiders.


&gt;Estonia, a nation of 1.3 million, is doing everything in its power to make the transition as seamless as possible. It offers one of the most comprehensive refugee-integration packages in Europe, providing each family with a furnished apartment immediately upon arrival, language courses, schools, translation services and a dedicated support person who will help guide the newcomers through the settling-in process.

3591,"Christianity used to be intertwined with the state, institutions like education and with traditions everywhere. The church also used to have a monopoly on actually being able to read the bible and interpreting it.

Once the general level of education rose and people could read the bible themselves, along with all the advancements in the sciences, the church ceased to be the authority it was. The church pushed the idea that they are important because of religion for too long while also being too heavily involved in worldly affairs and the power structures in society. Once religion became less important the church became easy to disregard.

There is a place for faith, community and contemplating your place in the world, but the church has been opposing a lot of things that are seen as natural progression of society by a lot of people, and allowed itself to become obsolete. 

In some.countries it has resisted too hard, in some countries it has become heavily politicized and will wax or wane according to the movements it has thrown in its lot with.

For Christianity to stay relevant in a spiritual way rather than as an ethnic or political marker, the church needs to reconcile itself with the idea of focusing on what role it CAN play in modern society rather than clinging to what role it used to play when it was kingmaker, keeper of knowledge and moral authority. If it doesn't it relegates itself to the role of old folks club and political tool, and that only lasts as long as the old folks and said political movements.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/efug9w/why_did_europeans_lose_their_interest_in/fc2id34/,PoliteAndPerverse,1577361828

3628,"Warning: a long post ahead, having a lazy morning with nothing else to do. Ah, Christmas time.

I respect your reasons. As I said, this is really just my opinion, and unfortunately as of now it goes against the grammar.

I do badmouth English in the same way people talk shit about their siblings and friends - all in good spirit. I use English in a daily basis, both at work and for personal stuff, and I am eternally grateful that the language exists. It's amazing how much it opens up the world to you. Instead of being able to communicate with about 20 million people (probably less), I can have a conversation with over a billion. Amazing!

I like discussing languages so allow me to address your beefs with my mother tongue. First off, impressive that you tried to learn it, that's cool! Is Hebrew similar to English in the points you laid out? I.e. is it not a gendered language, does it have definite articles etc? Or did you learn English from a very young age, so that those features of the language seem natural to you?

I concede that the Czech language has a lot of rules and isn't very easy to learn. But those rules convey additional information in the sentence, which in English needs to be expressed through more words, word order, or is just missing. For example:

&gt; John will come to the party with his friend. 

Is John's friend a man or a woman? I find that in a lot of cases this information is missing and is only addressed if the speaker talks about the friend specifically (using he/she pronoun). Under Czech grammar, this information is literally impossible to omit. As you rightly point out, however, this inherent gender-ness (?) of the language comes with the downside of having to assign genders to objects that really don't possess any. It's largely arbitrary, but at least consistent.

Pády, or grammatical cases, are another nifty feature that feels natural to us but may throw people coming from a language that doesn't have them off. And again, they are there for a reason, they convey information. Instead of having a rigid sentence order to indicate the subject, object and other atoms of the sentence, we change a few suffixes. The order of the sentence won't really matter anymore. This makes the language pretty flexible which can be useful for artistic stuff, like songs, literature, poetry. I find that we don't have puns in the same way and amount as English does, but our ""language jokes"" are still plentiful, just using this flexibility.

I used to have no idea what the definite articles were for when learning English. They seemed arbitrary and pointless. But after enough practice, they now feel natural and totally make sense. It's amazing how growing up with a certain language makes you think in a certain way. There's different ways that Czech expresses the information conveyed by articles, so it's still there, just in a different form. 

As an interesting counter point to raise in contrast to our lack of definitive articles, that's exactly how I feel about English not having a ""vid"", _grammatical aspect_ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect?wprov=sfla1). It's exactly the same as with the articles. The information this tool conveys succinctly in Czech is also present in English, but through a workaround. Quoting a part of the wiki link here:

&gt; Like tense, aspect is a way that verbs represent time. However, rather than locating an event or state in time, the way tense does, aspect describes ""the internal temporal constituency of a situation"", or in other words, aspect is a way ""of conceiving the flow of the process itself"". English aspectual distinctions in the past tense include ""I went, I used to go, I was going, I had gone""; in the present tense ""I lose, I am losing, I have lost, I have been losing, I am going to lose""; and with the future modal ""I will see, I will be seeing, I will have seen, I am going to see"". What distinguishes these aspects within each tense is not (necessarily) when the event occurs, but how the time in which it occurs is viewed: as complete, ongoing, consequential, planned, etc.

The case and tense is conflated in English, but in Czech those are two different concepts. But that will seem as weird and foreign to English native speakers as the concept of definitive articles sounds to Czechs.


As for the English spelling, I don't find it that much of an issue, somehow it comes naturally to me. But the fact that it's not a phonetic language and a lot of its vocabulary is borrowed from other languages makes it impossible to be able to infer how to pronounce a word one hasn't seen before.

when you ignore draft notice this is administrative violation, it converts into criminal only if you sign this draft notice and later ignore draft office.

In this case he avoided military service by ignoring draft notice for some time, so administrative case was opened.

Later he finally arrived at draft office, tryed to dispute that he fits military service etc. etc. etc.

But administrative case was opened all the time.

Police cannot detain you on the street and deliver to draft office - that would be illegal, with one exception - if there is administrative case for avoiding military service opened (in case of criminal case for avoiding military service they can do it too ofc)

The traitorous boyars and the ""citizens of the world"" traders had rights and courts and all that. But actual romanians, no, not at all. 

LEGAREA DE GLIE what does that mean ? How were gypsies more oppressed than our entire population being literal slaves in their own lands for hundreds of years ? Did gypsies fight at Calugareni ? Or by Cantemir's side ? How much gypsy blood was spilled on the battlefields in defence of these lands from the pagans ? 

Right, it's not their country, so why would they. This is reasonable. 

And even if i had made 1-2-3-4 errors, that does not make everything else i said false just because it doesn't fit your horrible understanding of history. If you think we romanians are the oppressors, why not fuck off  to a place where oppressive people don't live ey mate ? Since you believe you can just ""become"" something else, why not become anything else than a racist, xenophobic disgusting romanian ?

Fact : gypsies do not want to be now or anytime in the future anything else but gypsies. they are proud of being gypsies. Why do people like you want to make romanians be the racists in this story for not accepting the gypsies own decision regarding their identity? 

They themselves say they are not Romanians. When we say it it's racism ? How does that work ?

3873,"what the hell ? Gypsies themselves are extremely PROUD of not becoming romanians even in 500 years ? what the f-ing F are you on about ? Gypsies do not let their children marry with non-gypsies. And nobody here has any problems with that. Not us nor the gypsies. 

They do not identify as romanians, except in specific situations where it is convenient to do so, but never in their hearts. Gypsies consider westerners to be the most stupidly arrogant humans imaginable. They treat scandinavian prisons like spas, getting arrested when they need some more expensive medical treatement for example. Your kumbaya works on people who at least have a minimum amount of respect for laws, any laws. Gypsies do not consider any courts or laws, except their own, to have any kind of moral legitimacy on them and their actions.I know plenty of gypsies, professional thieves most of them, like most gypsies in my town (bout 1000 of them and 110000 of us). they do not steal much here, hardly anything anymore, because you complete asses in the west let yourselves be fooled by the most obvious lies and tricks just so that you don't have to have any wrong-thoughts.

 Or, God forbid, treat us and them as human beings with agency. No, we must be monsters and they must be victims because westerners have the deepness of understanding of a puddle. in the desert. on Mars. You f-ers murder-fucked your way across the world, and now you try and pass on your moral decrepitness on us ? Why, because we're white and they're not ? Or is it because we have a nation-state ?

We, romanians, were slaves for most of the time the gypsies were here. they had much more freedoms and rights for most of that time than any regular romanian person. Who was a slave on their own land to the infidel turk and their greek proxies. Gypsies had the freedom of movement. We Romanians, on Romanian lands had no such freedom. We were slaves while they were relatively free. We were cattle, they were artizans and artists, because it was forbidden on penalty of death to practice smithing as a romanian. You could start making swords at any moment. So only gypsies were allowed to be blacksmiths. We, regular people, the ""penis-masses"" as we say in Romania,  were not allowed any rights to any kind of trial under the muslim yoke. They were allowed to have trials of their own with no interference.


Almost all gypsies agree that they are not, nor will they ever be, nor do they want to ever be, anything else but gypsies. Certainly not Romanians. The feeling is mutual. They have been here for 400 years at most (ofc you have to exagerate to make your bullshit sound better) and we have been here since the fucking ice melted. They, just like the Romans, the Scythians, the Cumans, the Avars, the Bulgars, the Turks or the bolshevik devils, have come, and they will go to better pastures. 

Romania is the **nation state** of the Romanian people. That is Article 1 of the Constitution. It is non-debatable. If you don;t like the existence of nation-states, take it up with Israel or Poland. They suffered even more than us to have their own nation-state for their own people and now that is bad because why exactly ? Because Pakistanis in Birmingham refuse to integrate so it's starting to actually resemble Pakistan ? Does any of you dare ask those guys how they feel ? If they feel british or pakistani ? Of course not, because they themselves do not think of themselves as brits. Just like gypsies are not and never wanted to be romanians. That is reality. Where you see that as good or bad is debatable, but even denied facts are still true, even if 'hate based""

you are accusing us of being evil for doing what we all here agree is right for all of us. But you, le elightened redditor from memestan, you sir know the situation better. For you are the great white savior, the only hope humanity has left.

3874," Original from medusa.io:

Шаведдинов  подлежал призыву на военную службу, но до октября 2019 года уклонялся  от постановки на воинский учет. 28 октября Шаведдинов по повестке прибыл  в военный комиссариат и по результатам медицинского освидетельствования  был признан годным к военной службе.

Он  не согласился с решением призывной комиссии и оспорил его в суде. 11  ноября Савеловский районный суд Москвы отказал удовлетворить иск  Шаведдинова. 23 декабря Мосгорсуд оставил это решение в силе. Как  отмечает военный комиссариат, оно в тот же день вступило в силу, и  действие решения призывной комиссии возобновилось.

My translate:

Shaveddinov  should be conscripted to military service, but until october 2019 he  ignored draft office. 28 october he received official draft notice and  came to draft office, he was medically evaluated and recognized as fit  to military service.

He disputed  decision (at this date his draft to military service was paused) of  draft office and went to court. 11 november Savelovsky court refused his  lawsuit. 23 december Moscow City Court refused his lawsuit too. (at  this day his  draft to military service was resumed).

So his draft to military service in 24th december was perfectly legal.

PS. All drafted to military service **usually, but not always**  send to training first and then to actual military service (my wife's  brother for example went straigh to military unit, without training) -  that thing cannot be legal or illegal at all.",,/r/europe/comments/efka2y/security_forces_kidnap_kremlin_critic_force_him/fc27qvo/,d_rodin,1577344356

3932,"No. But confusing identity checks with encryption is a common misconception. That because when discussing both people here words like key's, encryption, certificates.

DNS encryption is basically normal DNS via TLS encryption. This means the communication from the resolver (the piece of software in every computer that asks a question or figures out the answer in any way he wishes) to the DNS server (the piece of software that is asked for questions and will ask forward if needed be) is encrypted. Think about being on a public wifi in an airport. Without encryption someone could see what domain names your phone or laptop queries. Without encryption there's also a possibility for men-in-the middle attack (which by it's name is very self-explanatory).

DNSSEC is about identity. That means making sure the response comes from a trusted source. As opposed to other protocols, DNS works fast and great because servers cache results. So when you ask for the IP address of [google.com](https://google.com), your ISP DNS will already know the answer and not ask forward. This means that if in that line someone manages to give a fake answer that fake answer will propagate to multiple users. Worse of, it will come from trusted sources (like your ISP DNS).

DNSSEC is about making sure any copy of the answer out there has come from the original source.

To bypass the UK porn-law VPNs or proxy's are used. The law mandates to make sure people that access them from the UK are over 18+ (by not trusting and refusing them otherwise).

There are some consequences of having a certain ""home commune"", e.g. until very recently your home commune was responsible to pay/compensate social contributions in case you can't find work and rely on welfare at the place where you live (home commune is not necessarily the place where you live and pay taxes).

The radio’s chatter of voices and music is briefly stilled; instead the sound of Angelus bells, peeling out an invocation to prayer, chimes out, slightly overlain by static. Agnes McKenna, an 83-year-old grandmother, pauses for a moment. When she was a child, she says, growing up with four siblings on a farm in western Ireland, at the sound of those bells everyone would stop what they were doing. Ploughs would halt in the middle of a field; farmhands would stand still and pray.

&amp;#x200B;

With the bells dying out in the background, Agnes resumes bustling about her kitchen, filling up the teapot and buttering slices of brown bread. As her 27-year-old granddaughter, Síona Cahill, lays the table she looks bemused at Agnes’s description of an Ireland where the Roman Catholic church did not just delineate the seasons of a year, or the stages of a person’s life, but was present hour by hour.

&amp;#x200B;

Much of Agnes’s life in Longford, a small town in central Ireland, still revolves around the church. She goes to Mass each day. Sister Pauline, a nun, is one of her closest friends. If Síona goes to Mass at all—which she might at Christmas or on other special occasions—she will not take the sacrament; she says her religion is in “people”. She lives with her girlfriend in Dublin, and spends much of her time campaigning for lgbt and women’s rights. “I’m not sure if I totally understand the present,” Agnes says. “It is going too fast for me.” For Síona, who takes up one social cause after another, it isn’t going nearly fast enough.

&amp;#x200B;

But when Síona came out as a lesbian six years ago, she told her grandmother before her parents, and found her to be utterly supportive. During the referendum campaign to liberalise Ireland’s abortion laws in 2018 Síona travelled down to Longford every weekend to canvass voters. Agnes once came out canvassing with her. She remains worried that young girls might use abortion “willy nilly”, but she still voted for liberalisation. She voted for same-sex marriage in 2015, too.

&amp;#x200B;

Síona’s values are perhaps not surprising. Agnes’s highlight a profound shift that has taken place in Ireland over the past four decades. The country was once one of the most conservative places in Europe. Now it is one of the more socially liberal. When Síona was born in 1992, homosexuality and abortion were illegal, divorce was prohibited and oral contraception was available only on prescription for married couples or for women with painful periods.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2015 62% voted to make same-sex marriage legal, despite most of those preaching from the pulpit expressing disapproval at the idea. Three years later, a whopping 66% voted with Agnes and Síona to repeal the eighth amendment to the constitution, which had valued the life of mother and fetus equally, and make abortion available to women in the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy. Both referendums had high turnouts: 60% for same-sex marriage and 64% for abortion. Divorce, which became legal only in 1995, was liberalised further in 2019. When Fine Gael, currently the governing party, chose a gay politician, Leo Varadkar, as its leader the country had no trouble accepting him as taoiseach.

&amp;#x200B;

“I do not think it is dramatic to call it a social revolution,” says Una Mullally, a journalist at the Irish Times who campaigned for both same-sex marriage and Repeal the 8th, the pro-choice campaign. Yet this revolution, as such, happened while 78% of the population still consider themselves to be Catholic, and while 91% of children attend a church-run school. How?

&amp;#x200B;

One reason is exposure to the outside world. Ireland is a small island with a large diaspora. When she was 15 Agnes left Leitrim, where she had grown up, to go to London to work as a hospital attendant. She encountered another world: one of dance halls, mostly, but also central heating and a secular health service. When she returned with her husband, Paddy, in the 1970s, her sister, who had stayed in Britain, would send them condoms in the post with the inscription “Happy nights!” (Condoms were banned until 1979, and available only on prescription until 1985.) This meant that, unlike a neighbour who was “forever pregnant all her life” with 15 children alive and several dead, Agnes had just two children. “I said this to the priest,” she recalls, with Síona looking on proudly, “What’s the point in having them if you can’t afford them?”

&amp;#x200B;

Diarmaid Ferriter, a historian at University College Dublin, points out that when Pope John Paul II visited Ireland in 1979—seemingly at the point where Ireland was still very devout—he warned in his Mass, given to over a million people in Dublin’s Phoenix Park, of “alien” influences turning people away from the church. He did not have in mind the cheap flights that Ryanair began to offer in the 1980s. But they did some of the trick.

&amp;#x200B;

The campaign tried to appeal to people because of their faith, not despite it

&amp;#x200B;

Increasingly, Irish people have taken a more “pragmatic” approach to their faith, says Mr Ferriter, by separating it from other aspects of their life. Susan McKay, a journalist in Dublin, sees it as “a new kind of Catholicism—a kind of Protestant relationship, just with God.” By the time Pope Francis made his own visit, in 2018, only around 150,000 people went to his Mass in Phoenix Park.

&amp;#x200B;

The process was undoubtedly speeded up by the scale of clerical abuse revealed in the 1990s and thereafter. That some clergy could be cruel was not news. Agnes remembers one priest, in her primary school, caning a girl over her knuckles to watch her cry (“Aw, it’s thawing,” he would say). Women, who supported the church in greater numbers and who gave more of their time to it, were also often degraded. After giving birth Agnes’s mother had to be “churched”: blessed by the priest before she could take the sacrament again, as if she were unclean. She remembers another woman, when she asked a priest for advice about how to stop having so many children, being told to “do her womanly duty”. “They said jump and you said how high,” she says.",,/r/europe/comments/efpoeb/the_liberalisation_of_ireland/fc1sp1t/,bm52oc,1577328494

As polish person I have no problem with Ukraine people fighting back(though I do have problem with brutal methods used by them) against Poland because I recognized Poland didnt exactly treat them well, but it has nothing to do with soviets, saying their attack was justifed would be like saying its justifed for european countries to attack and take parts of russia lands because of what russia did to ukraine.

You do realize that Jewish people feel safer in Poland then in many of western european  countries, I wont say that there isnt any antisemitism in because there is like in any country, but its not common as some people say and its mirrred by similar anti-polish sentient  among some jewish people, I myself experianced it; some jewish people saying stuff like: polish people are stupid or polish people are uneducated.

I cant stress enough the fact that relations between polish jewish and non-jewish people were extremly complex which was affected by many factors and lead to even more tensions, like for example when soviets entered Poland Jewish people welcomed them with open arms, many jewish people were litreally helping disarm polish people, from perespective of polish people those jewish people betrayed them them, whats more when soviets occupied Poland they recruited many jewish people to their infamous institutions that were used to terrorize polish people.",,/r/europe/comments/ef9xg5/putin_accuses_poland_of_colluding_with_hitler/fc1hg87/,Culaio,1577318888

&gt;	On one nighttime march through a rain-filled trench, his squadron came across a soldier cemented into the mud and left behind by his own fellow infantrymen. “We made some vain efforts to pull him out,” Barthas recorded, “almost to the point of pulling his arms and legs out of their sockets. Seeing that we too were abandoning him, he begged us to put him out of his misery with a rifle shot … „While we were trying to dig out this poor guy, our comrades in the squad ahead had disappeared. We called out to them, and got no answer. Were they already that far away, or had they all drowned?” Eventually soldiers on all sides could not endure this hell. Part of survival ultimately depended on refusing to obey orders, even as their officers promised to shoot them on the spot should they not advance. Soon troops from both sides exited the trenches, met their enemies in peace and even agreed not to fire on one another. Barthas came upon “French and German sentries seated tranquilly on their parapets, smoking pipes and exchanging bits of conversation from time to time, like good neighbors taking some fresh air at their doorsteps.”

4149,"&gt;You narrow the fundamental question down to a very popular narrative of what (Polish) history is. Here one can see the effect the nationalist lens has on unbiased attempts to explore history because this narrative assumes path dependency and rests itself on popular and politically convenient assumptions.

You: nationalism is always bad

Me: actually, nationalism is not always bad, because it was a driving force that allowed Poles to survive both the three-empire occupation throughout 19th century, as well as the WW2 period.

&gt;For example, longing or nationalist activism for a unified state was not universal among Poles. 

No, it was only universal among those who were politically active, or in positions of power. Most Poles, just like most people elsewhere during the 19th century, did not care about politics, or were not activists for any cause.

&gt;Neither is the implication correct that during wartime the main or even a predominant factor in most Poles considerations were means to achieve independence. 

Every big European war was looked as such opportunity, and WW1 was no exception. The major Polish politicians all visited Tokyo during the Russo-Japanese war in 1904-1905, to discuss potential Japanese support for the Polish cause, and similar efforts were made during the Crimean war. The Polish units within the Austrian army that entered the Congress Poland in 1914, did so with an exceptation that by the end of the war, they will be swearing allegiance to a Polish state, in whichever form it might arise (sure, after 100 years of defeat after defeat, the expectations were low, and most probably expected something akin to a small rump state that would be joint German-Austrian protectorate).

&gt;In the end, it is apparent that although you imply universal applicability of your definition of nationalism as a positive force all you really base that on is a narrow and particularist (Polish) experience. 

One counterexample is enough to disprove a general rule.

&gt;Furthermore, and only to set the record straight on some incorrect claims of yours: The unprofitability of German colonial ventures was clear and predicted from their very beginning

1) you never know unless you try

2) imperialist conquests don't always have to be profitable

&gt;and second you consistently fail to see where imperialism comes from, how it is maintained and how it is fuelled

Imperialism existed millenia before nationalism. Or are you trying to imply that Alexander the Great's conquests, Roman empire, Arabian jihad, Spanish colonization of the new world, or Swedish involvement in 17th century wars in Europe were all somehow fueled by ""nationalism"", before it even existed in anything resembling its modern form. That's anachronism, bad assesment of the situation, and mistaking cause for effect.

&gt;Third, the Polish king swearing to regain lost lands was not acting in any ""national"" interest but in the interest of the aristocracy he depended on to cement his ascension to power.

Other justifications, same end effect. European states were able tonfind more than enough justifications to attempt to destroy each other long before nationalism has been discovered. A conflict on a scale comparable to WW1 would eventually happen given similar advances in logistics, tactics and technology, with or without nationalism.","Warsaw, Poland",/r/europe/comments/efecxe/has_something_happened_to_this_sub_lately/fc1jc25/,nieuchwytnyuchwyt,1577320477

4344,"**- Ecology is a very dangerous phenomenon, because it is not only in the form of teenagers, it is something that imposes itself and this activist becomes an oracle for all political and social forces - believes Archbishop Marek Jędraszewski.**

Archbishop Marek Jędraszewski talked about ecology in a manner that contradicts the teaching of the Catholic Church.

\- I quote it briefly: a return to Engels and his claims that marriage is another manifestation of oppression, and in the name of equality one must break with the entire Christian tradition, without which we - Europeans will not understand each other because we have been brought up in it for millennia. This is being questioned by various new movements, and is also being attempted to impose itself as a binding doctrine, ""said the priest.

\- This is a very dangerous phenomenon, because it is not just a teenager figure (ed. Greta Thunberg), it is something that imposes itself, and this activist becomes an oracle for all political and social forces. This is contrary to everything that is recorded in the Bible, beginning with the Book of Genesis, which explicitly mentions the miracle of God's creation - he continued.

\- God is amazed by this world, man is placed as the crowning achievement of all creation. The Scriptures clearly say ""make your land a subject"". Adam is someone who names animals, so he controls them and does not find among them someone who would be a partner for his life, so he receives a wife. This is the vision of man and the world that Christianity proclaims and which is also a vision deeply rooted in Judaism. Everything is questioned at once, in fact our culture is questioned, the whole world order is reversed, starting from the fact that the existence of God - the creator is questioned, the role and dignity of every human being are also questioned - he added.",,/r/europe/comments/efl7kv/archbishop_jędraszewski_ecology_is_a_dangerous/fc10u30/,bm52oc,1577305030

4436,"Excerpt:

&gt;Last year, the conservative government proposed a policy package dubbed “the ghetto plan.” The plan was sold as a solution to get rid of “parallel societies” where inhabitants experience high crime rates, high concentrations of immigrants (their words), and low levels of education.

&gt;People in these areas are now subject to a set of special laws deliberately designed to be disproportionately penalizing, and the police have been given the power to impose “special punishment zones” wherein punishments are doubled.  Here, what would have been a 1,000 DKK fine for some infraction now costs you 2,000 DKK — and the same goes for a prison sentence.

&gt;Moreover, people on unemployment benefits are not allowed to move into these areas — and if you are already a resident and commit a crime, it is comparably easier for you to be thrown out of your home. This same penalizing spirit applies to the classroom. Alongside other measures, children as young as six years old are forced to take language tests, there are sanctions on families’ financial support if children skip school or exams, high schools are allowed to limit the number of students from immigrant families, and there are mandatory classes in “Danish values” for children from the age of one.

&gt;The plan also includes mechanisms that give the state new powers to intervene in these areas’ “composition” in terms of tenure and ownership. Once an area has been on the “ghetto list” for four years, it is classified as a “hard ghetto,” and the share of public housing has to be brought down to 40 percent of the total. This means that buildings can be torn down and the land sold off to private developers, simply because there are too many poor and ethnic-minority residents. Over the next few years, 11,000 people are expected to be evicted because they live in one of the country’s fifteen “hard ghettos.”",Europe,/r/europe/comments/efjlwr/denmarks_shameful_ghetto_plan_denmarks_ghetto/fc0rq26/,tamyahuNe2,1577298058

4505,"They're bound by a lot of things.

Pro family values for instance, whatever that means. They basically want the same thing, albeit from a different perspective. Alt-right is ultranationalist. To keep your society ethnically clean *and* growing (or at a steady rate), you need to promote traditional marriage (male-female) between native inhabitants. Both alt-right and religious lunatics can find themselves in this view.


It's no different over here. Our alt-right (PVV and even more so FvD) and the religious lunatics (SGP) get along very well.

[Here's](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/05/houellebecqs-unfinished-critique-of-liberal-modernity/) what the leader of FvD (Baudet) has to say about independent women:

&gt;The “liber­ated” status of women is usually celebrated as one of the great triumphs of late-liberal society. Today women, from an early age, are encouraged to pursue a career and be financially independent. They are expected to reject the traditional role of supporting a husband and strive instead for an “equal” relationship in which “gender roles” are interchangeable.
&gt;
But how has this really been working out for them? What hap­pens when they hit thirty? If they continue to work full hours, building a family becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible. 
&gt;
This is why women in the Western world increasingly tend to have fewer children—if they even have them at all. Work and children then often limit the time available for the maintenance of a committed relationship, and rare are the lovers that both work full hours, rear children, and invest sufficiently in each other for the marriage to remain healthy over time. 
&gt;
An inevitable result of all this is the demographic decline of Europe. Another outcome is constant con­flict, constant competition—and in the end, fighting, divorce, and social isolation—and a new generation of boys and girls growing up in such disfigured settings.

If you have the ability to read between the lines, you will notice that Baudet does not approve of women having equal rights and making their own choices. He even uses quotation marks to emphasize that he does not view it as liberation.

Oh boy, doesn't that sound familiar? The SGP (our christian far-right) didn't even allow women to run for office (or anything in politics) up until a few years ago.

They're both not fond of the idea of independent women making their own decisions.

But perhaps more importantly, both groups long for a strong leader, whether it be god or some douchebag on earth. They want someone they can look up to and follow no matter what. They *need* an entity to worship. They're both cultlike.

It's not unthinkable that said parties will be part of our government over here in the Netherlands at some point in the not so distant future. Needless to say, I'm not particularly fond of that prospect.

On another note, I don't think Boris is alt-fight. He's just the epitome of opportunism. He'll say anything to stay in power.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/efgo69/boris_johnson_pledges_to_stand_up_for_christians/fc0gaqv/,_superleo,1577290178

4515,"Conservatives in Europe have a different history than Americans. Some are from monarchist movements and thus prefer a strong state. Some are aligned with either the protestant or catholic church and focus on traditional social values, but are also friendly or strong supporters of a well-fare state, as long as this includes the various hospitals and institutions of their churches. These two movements sometimes were historically allied, and sometimes at odds. There are also local conservative movements who are in opposition to a central state controlled by a different ethnic or religious group. 

Market liberals traditionally were considered a separate movement.

In the second half of the 20th century then a massive change appeared when the prostate conservatives, the pro-church conservatives and the market- liberals were fused into one movement, usually called Christian democrats. Then you had parties were you had some people claiming measuring the GDP was the first step to a state planned economy, and others demanding the coal and steel industries should be nationalized. That worked were well.

Since the 80s or so that Big Tent approach has disappeared and there is a drift towards a more anglo-saxon style of conservatism.  The Christian element has become weaker, and young activists who would have been Christian democrats 30 years ago may now go to the Greens.

4530,"You narrow the fundamental question down to a very popular narrative of what (Polish) history is. Here one can see the effect the nationalist lens has on unbiased attempts to explore history because this narrative assumes path dependency and rests itself on popular and politically convenient assumptions. 

For example, longing or nationalist activism for a unified state was not universal among Poles. Neither is the implication correct that during wartime the main or even a predominant factor in most Poles considerations were means to achieve independence. In the end, it is apparent that although you imply universal applicability of your definition of nationalism as a positive force all you really base that on is a narrow and particularist (Polish) experience. That cannot be the groundwork on which to build understanding.

What I originally was getting at is that nationalism cannot be defended because in some historical cases it happened to work towards legitimate goals. It must be looked at on its own merits and in that case it becomes clear that ideology built on nothing but the propagation and furthering of the in-group must inevitably cause conflict with others. In simpler terms: There is no *overdose* of nationalism that causes harm, rather harm to others - only in different degrees - is inherent in the logic of nationalism. 

Furthermore, and only to set the record straight on some incorrect claims of yours: The unprofitability of German colonial ventures was clear and predicted from their very beginning; and second you consistently fail to see where *imperialism* comes from, how it is maintained and how it is fuelled. Here nationalism usually plays a vital role.

	Boris Johnson has used his first Christmas message as prime minister to highlight concerns over the persecution of Christians around the world, saying that he is determined that they should retain the right to practise their faith.

In his first Christmas message to the nation as prime minister, Mr Johnson declared: “Today of all days, I want us to remember those Christians around the world who are facing persecution. For them, Christmas Day will be marked in private, in secret, perhaps even in a prison cell.”

He added: “As prime minister, that’s something I want to change. We stand with Christians everywhere, in solidarity, and will defend your right to practise your faith.”

	A series of recent reports has highlighted how Christians have become widely targeted across the world.

A report by the Bishop of Truro for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office recently identified “a global phenomenon of discriminatory behaviour and physical attacks, some sadly deadly, on Christian children, women and men, often from the world’s poorest communities”.

The bishop’s report said that persecution had become especially strong in the Middle East. It stated: “The 2011 uprisings and the fall of old dictatorships gave ground to religious extremism that has increased greatly the pressures upon and persecutions of Christians in Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Libya.”

In June 2018, the Pew Research Centre stated that over the course of 2016 Christians had suffered harassment in 144 countries. By that calculation, Christians emerge as the world’s “most widely targeted” faith group, slightly ahead of Islam”.

In his speech, Mr Johnson said he hoped that people would not argue at the Christmas lunch table, in what is regarded as a thinly veiled allusion to Brexit.

“Folks, I hope you enjoy the next few days,” he said, adding: “Try not to have too many arguments with the in-laws, or anyone else.”

The prime minister’s spokesman said he would be spending Christmas Day at Number 10 Downing Street with his partner, Carrie Symonds, and their dog Dilyn.",,/r/europe/comments/efgo69/boris_johnson_pledges_to_stand_up_for_christians/fc07i5t/,casualphilosopher1,1577281842
4563,"The Austro-Hungarian monarchy did in truth provide a very strong common identity for many of its inhabitants, including those you mentioned. Legitimacy, tradition and stability were what it provided in an area of Europe without clean or neat national borders, where many different people lived together. In much of its area, being of a particular nation but *also* a monarchist was not at odds with each other. Remember that by and large the men drafted into the army fought with discipline and even conviction for the Austro-Hungarian state. It was possible to feel emotional attachment to the Empire and monarchy, to a particular region, to a nation and to a religion all without significant conflicts.

Many of the German speakers scattered in the Empire were Jews who often did not consider themselves German. 

&gt;It was one of the many factors that lead to WW1, but not a decisive one. It amplified the militarism and imprlerialism of the European great powers, sure, but wasn't the main cause of it.

Why? As I wrote, French nationalism and revanchism due to Alsace was about the only reason for the very high military expenditures, the continuous planning for war with Germany for decades and so on and on. What other reason was there that nationalism really just amplified? The militarism and confrontational policy had no rational reason.

And the same applies to Germany. Much of the confrontational policy pursued by the young nation state cannot be explained by rational choice or economic necessity. It is only reasonable and appropriate to attribute to nationalism a grand part of the reasons for why for example a completely unprofitable colonial adventure was ever began. This was a struggle for grandeur and prestige and it was fueled by and justified with nationalist goals.

&gt;There's also another side of nationalism, as it's also what allowed countries such as Poland, which got conquered in late 18th century and were erased from maps, to survive a century of occupation

I always consider it very limited and frankly dishonest to attribute to nationalism only the resistance of the subdued side but leave out that nationalism also fuelled and drove everything the occupying side did. As nationalist currents rose within the occupying powers, life generally became harder for the occupied. I believe that lets one draw a conclusion: that something inherent within placing one group above and beyond all others as well as the continuous exercise to define and maintain borders and differences between oneself and the other group simply leads to conflict and always risks mistreatment and irrational hate towards the outside. 

This is not to say anyone was wrong to feel Polish in the 19th century or that it was wrong for Poles to strive for self-determination and recognition. But it makes me firmly believe that just as with the human rights of the individual the rights of a self-identified group must end exactly there where they tread on another humans - or groups - rights. And unfortunately, if the inherent logic of nationalism is followed further and further towards the off the deep end, its demands begin to lead to just that.",-6 points 9 minutes ago,/r/europe/comments/efecxe/has_something_happened_to_this_sub_lately/fc07iv6/,Bojarow,1577281865

4634,"&gt; Gavrilo Princip didn't start WW I, so implying that nationalism started WW I and poting to Princip is simply factually false.

I just took Princip because it’s the quickest and easiest example of how prominent nationalism was, although it obviously isn’t a very good one. Saying that nationalism played no role in starting WW1 is absurd. Nationalist forces were prominent throughout Europe, particularly obvious in the case of minorities in Austria-Hungary. France’s main reason for joining the war - its revanchist desire to get back Alsace-Moselle - was clearly nationalist as was Italy’s desire to get South Tyrol and the Adriatic coast. 

I’m not saying that there weren’t other forces at play, but nationalism was definitely a big one.


&gt;If you accept that nationalism is guilty because of Princip you must also accept that globalism/internationalism is guilty for Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya... Hardly a peaceful counterpart to nationalism

I do think that globalism was a factor in causing these wars but I don’t see why you think that if I believe that nationalism caused WW1 I should automatically think this?",Europe,/r/europe/comments/efecxe/has_something_happened_to_this_sub_lately/fc08pja/,Worldgnasher,1577283167

\&gt;  Trump in mid-November hosted his Turkish counterpart at the White House, calling him a “very good friend.” This month, however, he signed a defense bill that included sanctions against Turkey, notably blocking delivery of U.S. fighter jets ordered by Turkey. 

\&gt;  “We don’t want the sanctions \[on Turkey\], but they will happen,” a senior U.S. official said. “It will hurt Turkey.” 

\&gt;  The main bone of contention is Turkey’s purchase of the S-400 system, which the Pentagon views as a security threat to NATO.  

\&gt;  U.S. officials say Washington would rather pay substantial compensation than deliver a single F-35 to Turkey and jeopardize the integrity of the multibillion-dollar program. 

\&gt;  Turkey carried out a test of the S-400 system, deployed at an airbase near Ankara, against U.S.-made F-16 jets in late November, and it said it might order Russian combat aircraft if the F-35 delivery ban wasn’t lifted.

He is anything but. He is entirely amoral and distinctly authoritarian, happy to push a xenophobic agenda to further his personal power. He’s openly attacked the judiciary, Parliament, for example. No centrist liberal would behave the way Johnson does. 

&gt;	He has said he wants to increase immigration from commonwealth countries like India and Pakistan.

This is distinctly Trumpian. Says one thing and does another, because he knows that people don’t follow him closely, so if talks a good game people will give him a pass. 

Remember that he recently said Muslim women look like letterboxes first example. He’s used all sorts of racial and homophobic slurs. 

He gives a wink and a nod to the far right to keep them on side. There’s a reason Britain First say Tories are now like them and endorse them. 

&gt;	In the US Boris Johnson would be closest to Joe Biden, and in Italy he would be left of Renzi.

In case of WW2 Nazism and Communism were driving factors, nazism was based on some extreme form of nationalism - True.   


The issue here is that many people are taught one line of though - that it is nationalism that caused wars, while staying silent on positive aspect of nationalism.

Since the says of world war 2, a nation taking another nations land was made “illegal”. This is a reason why Saddam was a universally hated figure- his acts to annex parts of Iran and Kuwait was an unprecedented dive back at the ways of conquest from 1800s. 

This is also way NATO never allowed Kosovo to join Albania- rather try to make it a entire country. 
But Russian Crimea adventures will see very very real consequences. It won’t matter if the right was there- if the action was justified- any and all reason can and will be corrupted by another part some time later. 

Putin of course, as a strong shirtless, bear taming man- needs to show his masculinity. For Russia- a country that cannot see embarrassment- whose identity is rooted is strong man strength. There is no way from him to reverse the Crimea situation without looking weak. And for the west- and nations.

Presenting subjective and far from proven opinions as historical facts isn't all that correct. I'm not saying you deserve downvotes for doing so, but you are wrong. You say that nationalism caused world-wars, which is true in the same sense that oxygen caused world-wars, both existed during WW1 and WW2. But we also had massive wars like the 30-year war before nationalism was invented, which alone is enough to discredit your ""fact"".

4849,"Few things to remember about start of WWII that comrades from EU parliament ""forgot"" to mention:

Poland was first country to sign agreement with Hitler: [German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German–Polish_Non-Aggression_Pact) and then went on to carve Czechoslovakia with him. Compelling Churchill to write in his memoirs: *""...of that very Poland which with hyena appetite had only six months before joined in the pillage and destruction of the Czechoslovak State.""*

This was especially cynical act since Poland had defense treaty against Germany with France, which non-aggression pact with Hitler de facto nullified, freeing Hitler's hands.

For some time Poland was negotiating alliance against Soviet Union with Hitler, but that broke on the question of so called [Polish Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Corridor). Hitler demanded it for exchange of joint invasion of Soviet Union.

Territories that Soviets took from Poland in 1939 are called ""Ukraine"" and ""Belarus"". They were garbed by Poland when [Poland attacked Soviets in 1919-1920](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish–Soviet_War) while they were occupied with civil war.

4850,"1. It is working well to tax companies. You need a vat or a revenue tax to properly do that but that last one is more risky cause you can tax a company into non-existance if the margins they are making are slim.

VAT is probably better for small business because all companies pay it and you can not game it (easily), something the bigger companies can do with other taxes while smaller businesses do not have manpower to do that.


2. It has been here for decades so no idea. Recently we unified some levels and basically increased the VAT and that was a bad idea because it didnt get compensated with more money for poorer people.

But as a whole I feel because of VAT we are able to fund a big welfare state. Wealth taxes were easy to avoid, income tax also doesnt work as rich people dont have income. With that said I'd say VAT is probably the most progressive tax as in it heavily taxes rich people in €, all other taxes fail to tax the rich because of loopholes.",,/r/europe/comments/ef9w8x/questions_on_the_value_added_tax/fbzyr6b/,Monsjoex,1577269069

I am not a fan of Russia's current geopolitics but neither Ukraine nor Poland are truly innocent sheep here. Both countries have threatened to cut or tax gas going from Russia to Germany. Not all of these threats were made as a reaction to Russian aggression.

Then there was the Russian/Ukraine gas dispute where Ukraine didn't pay its bills. You can't blame that one on the Russians either. Ukraine had the best deal ever but didn't pay up. They literally paid a fixed $1.4 per 1 million BTU guaranteed between 2002 and 2013. That's barely 50% of the lowest average world market price during that time (with prices peaking at an annual avg of over $8).

This is a very complex matter and really doesn't boil down to ""Russia bad, you trade with them so you bad too"".

5014,"&gt; how much paperwork there is if you shoot someone

Luckily, I didn't shoot anyone when was there :)

But jokes aside,  it is an interesting question. 
If you want to sack your employee in Russia, you have to do:

1) Write down  his  violation (strictly in according to this employee's ""job description""
2) Receive an ""explanatory/excuse note"" from this employee. If he doesn't admit this violation, as a chief you have to convene a commission to investigate this.
3) Send this paper to the HR. HR will receive an addition explanation and send these papers to the CEO
4) CEO will issue the order of ""reprimand"".

Then, you have to collect from 2 to 3 ""reprimands"" (depends on severity if these violations) to sack this worker officially. Most workers would quit after the first or second reprimand, or go to the ""labour inspectorate"" to complain.

5139,"I dont want to debate the semantics of Mein Kampf. Jews has been likened to vermin for decades in Germany, and once the Bolsheviks became prominent so were they. I study Nazism and other fascist movements and I can tell you that Nazi candidates did not run on a blanket ""exterminate the Jews"" platform in the few free elections that they participated in. Just because the term ""extermination"" was used in early Nazi rhetoric does not mean that the atrocity of efficient and institutionalized mass murder was the plan all along (though it may have been Hitler's personal ambition), nor does it mean that all those who voted for the Nazis were voting for the purpose of establishing concentration camps to facilitate the murder of women and children. I have no doubt that some of the more radical members of the electorate would have voted for the Nazis if they had run on such a platform, but the notion that the Germans effectively ""voted for Auschwitz"" and got what they asked for ignores the reality that the Nazis came to power as a result of a coalition of both moderate and extreme political forces. Even some Jews voted and advocated for the Nazis until they were eventually purged closer to the start of the war. If someone told the ""average"" voter in 1933 a true account of what would come to be known as the Holocaust, that voter would probably dismiss it as a wild conspiracy theory. Hitler actually had to cull the more extreme aspects of his party during the Night of Long Knives so that he could gain more mainstream support. If your assertion that Hitler could have run on a platform of ""let's kill 6 million Jews"" and still win is correct, why were Hitler's earlier political efforts not more successful? Why didn't he just run on such a platform from the outset if so many were supposedly calling for the blood of innocent men, women, and children during the days of the Weimar Republic?",,/r/europe/comments/eewgg7/a_photograph_taken_in_1932_by_rachel_wife_of/fbz9dwq/,H-E-Pennypacker_,1577239219

5141,"&gt;Yes, but that's in the public debt segment. Most of it was refinanced at very low interest rates too.

I'm assuming you're taking this nugget off some RTE story...

Over half of long-term government bonds in Ireland are held by non-residents; if there are any adverse economic shocks around the world anytime soon (which is likely), foreign owners of debt will be quick to divest of bonds and so raise our refinancing costs again.

5198,"As the two greats (Rosa and Barks) I also want to mention that the weekly Donald Duck magazines  also often had comics by the Itallian artists, such as Marco Rota and Romano Scarpa, who has made a staggering amount of comics.

Donald Duck has managed to inspire a great deal of passion, in a lot of great artists, allowing for a great variety of stories. There are classic adventure stories, Kafkaesque stories where everything goes wrong and Slice of Life stories. Then there are the superhero Paperinik stories and the stories focusing on ""Not-Donald"" ducks, such as Andold Temerary (Kalle/Anders/Donald Vildand), Donalds ancient Scottish ancestor. 

Mickey on the other hand has a supporting cast that is either completely forgettable (Chief O'Hara, Clarabelle Cow, Horace Horsecollar) or overshadows him completely (Goofy, Pluto). In many comics he don´t really have a personality beyond ""Moves the Plot Along"". 

Compare the mystery stories they are in.

In mystery stories with Donald he will be afraid and seek to escape the situation, he will quarrel with the other investigators and he will end up fighting the bad guy to protect his friends.

Mickey, on the other hand will investigate a bit, talk some exposition and then be captured by the bad guys. He will then escape using some sort of generic trick (Such as burning his ropes with a hidden magnifier glass). Finally he will get the police and arrest the bad guys. If you are lucky he does it himself after getting a gun. Most of the Mickey stories rely on his supporting cast (By which I mean Goofy) to add some personality into the world and to make him look interesting.",,/r/europe/comments/ef2e89/in_sweden_we_have_a_tradition_of_watching_donald/fbzc538/,Treecreaturefrommars,1577241799

5222,"At first you really made me doubt *mais je n'avais pas la berlue*, I was wrong by forcing the meaning of what I read and by mixing some elements (you were right to criticize me about that) but some times ago I found articles talking about the expertise of Daniel Zagury, the first psychiatrist to work on the case of Kobili Traoré, who concluded, to simplify it a lot, that he was penally responsible because his heavy consommation of drugs was a voluntary act, and that the delirium crisis during which he murdered Sarah Halimi was a consequence of this voluntary act. 
The thing is : if this man has indeed mental problems the seven psychiatrists in charge of the case don't succeed to agree about the presence of a psychiatric pathology in him. A psychiatric hospital will free him after more or less time if the experts in this hospital judge him no more dangerous for him or the others, it isn't a branch of the penitentiary or judiciary system, if *l'abolition du discernement* is held then all the penal charges will vanish if I am not wrong. Me Szpiner is actually quite right in his accusations even if he is indeed exaggerating.
The second case of the articles you shared seems a bit similar to Sarah Halimi case judging by the few elements on the paper, it is surprising. But then why so many people including lawyers say that they fear the trial or absence of trial of Kabili Traoré could make jurisprudence if there are former similar cases, is it pure communication ?

5351,"&gt;You seem to be using words loosely when they are well defined terms. Mortality rate is what I have mentioned, you are talking about survival rate. Mind the words you are using.

Yes I make a claim about A, you say ""well what about completely irrelevant X"".

&gt;Also your extraordinary claims about how USA has head and shoulders better cancer survival rates are nonsense - first of all you don't specify what type of cancer you are talking about - cancer maybe one name but the types of it are different enough that you need a different kind of treatments. But regardless USA is not heads and shoulders in survival rates regarding any type of cancer and as you can see in the following link US has worst survival rate for cervical cancer and is in the middle of compared countries when comparing five-year survival of colon cancer.

In fact, I do. In my sources which mentions it, it is clearly stated it's about all cancers combined.

And yes. US is head and shoulders above the UK. Or Canada. Usually it's number 1, perhaps not for every single disease (or every single cancer), but that'd be unrealistic expectations.

&gt; type of cancer and as you can see in the following link US has worst survival rate for cervical cancer and is in the middle of compared countries when comparing five-year survival of colon cancer.

Wrong.

UK survival rate for cervical cancer (5 years) is 67%. In US is 66%. Statistically irrelevant difference.

For colon cancer US beats UK. In US (5 years) survival rate is 64%.   UK is 58. 6% is already withing statistically relevant information.

So you're wrong.

https://www.bowelcanceruk.org.uk/news-and-blogs/news/survival-rates-for-bowel-cancer-have-plateaued,-according-to-new-figures/

So your ""US is worst"", ""US is the middle of the pack"" are completely false information.

If US is in the middle of the pack for five year survival of colon cancer, is UK with African countries ? 

&gt;You like to talk down but you basically are unable to back up the shit you are spouting. Learn some manners and do proper research in data before you go around spouting nonsense.

I actually do backup everything I say. the fact that you can't grasp simple statistics is your own fault.

5372,"While there are also benefits to pulling gas extracted within the EU (Netherlands, Cyprus, whatever), from Norway, via LNG, whatever, I'd point out that ""buying gas from Russia"" and ""buying gas from Russia and permitting cutting out other countries from the transit"" are two different matters.  NS2 directly impacts the second in a big way.

I think that there's some confusion on the sub between the two, because I've seen a lot of threads that look something like this:

1. [Polish flair]: ""NS2 is is detrimental to European unity.""

2. [German flair]: ""Ah, then why does Poland buy Russian gas?""

The reason the complaining about NS2 in particular happens is that it physically permits knocking existing providers out of the loop, eliminates a source of European interdependence.  It's not primarily about gas coming from Russia originally (which I suppose that it'd be great not to have in place, but frankly Europe is probably going to continue to use gas from Russia).  Russia *mostly* dicks around in European states in the east, so from a standpoint of ""Europe acting as a unit"", it's desirable to have mechanisms that cause states in western Europe to want to act with them.

The EU in aggregate buying gas from Russia does create a dependence, and one that Russia could theoretically exploit, but it'd also mean a whole lot of resources in Europe immediately aligned against Russia if Russia pulled much malarky.  Russia is very unlikely to try to tussle with the EU as a whole economically.

It also does mean some funds go to Russia, but at least presently, there isn't an aim of zeroing that.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ef3t1v/british_pm_johnson_says_not_possible_to_reset/fbyse3f/,duisThias,1577225058

You should read the complete text and not only the parts you like. 

&gt; I don't understand what conservative means if mass immigration is not considered a problem ""per sé"". 

Thats why I explained it to you. Despite the fact that ""mass immigration"" is such a dull phrase, immigration isnt a problem for conservatives. The problem conservatives have with it is, that they fear a change in society or worse safety. If immigrants integrate in the society and the society benefits from it, conservatives rarely have a problem with it.

In fact many many christian churches allow same-sex marriage. If you want an overview, this [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_on_same-sex_marriage#Christianity) should help you.

5477,"Funny thing about Sturmabteilung, or SA

&gt;The Sturmabteilung (SA), or Storm Troopers, were in effect the military arm of the Nazi Party. It was an all-male, anti-Semitic, aggressive, radical organization headed by Ernst Roehm – an open homosexual. “Open,” that is, in terms of that period: He never made his sexual orientation public, but everyone knew about it. The fact that the head of the SA was an openly gay man is dramatic and, as far as I know, unprecedented for a right-wing, radical, fascist party. The Nazi Party was the only one during the period of the Weimar Republic whose leadership included declared homosexuals. And in fact, of all the parties in Germany, it was the Social Democrats who attacked the Nazis in election campaigns over Roehm’s sexual preferences.

You forgetting that this problem is inherent for developed economies, which Russia still did not achieve. We are now only in the process of second demographic transition   

&gt; Russia have increased pension age from very low number it had in any case. One of the last European countries to do so.  

Let's not pretend that this reform was ok, just because it had to be done. Firstly, because it wasn't, government sits on loads of money already and doesn't invest in anything. Just boasting how they have budget surplus and pointing fingers at US' national debt. Secondly, it was done in a blatant way, without any compensation or preparation for people who were about to go on pension.   
You've got last month of work? Just kidding! Go work 2 years more. Very nice.  

You really should compare this reform, to the one they did in Finland in 2017. Let's also not forget how they multiple times froze pension savings from accumulating.     

&gt;  Problems Russia have are nowhere unique to Russia, they are common for all developed capitalistic countries  

Which, again, Russia is not.    

&gt; Unlike in EU, Russian government at last try to do something with the fertility, instead of encouraging immigration of unqualified workforce with alien culture as only solution like many other European countries do.

5663,"\&gt;  That doesn't mean that comparing it to EA, as if it is an equal, is sane. EA's revenue is massively greater. 

It makes better products than EA according to basically everybody in the gaming industry. EA is where gaming studios and franchises go to die :) When was the last time they created a new good IP? Yes they are bigger, but it's like IBM vs Apple. All capital advantage, little innovation, low customer satisfaction. They are the most hated gaming publisher by far since 00s.

Do you remember Zynga? They were the EA of the mobile games. Bought everybody, made copy-paste games, were the biggest company in that market. Everybody hated them. Where are they now ;) ? 

\&gt;   this is a company that relies on one or two products at a time 

CD Projekt exists since early nineties, it was a game publisher and translator before it started creating its own games, it bought several other publishers in central and eastern Europe, it created and still owns 3rd most popular digital distribution platform for PC called [gog.com](https://gog.com) (behind Steam and Epic Store).

It's not just a game developer.

And when it comes to games it doesn't only have Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 - it also has Gwent card game which started earning money after IOS release, and is soon getting Android release. It's a big deal in China and Android is much more popular than IOS there so it will probably be a moderate success.

Besides - focusing on a few games is a valid strategy - see Rockstar with GTA series or Bethesda with Fallout and Elder Scrolls series.

\&gt; If a product fails, then the company can die. 

they have less than 1% debt to assets ratio, big cash reserves, made Cyberpunk with their own money. Even if Cyberpunk flops financially (basically impossible because of hype and preorders) - they won't default. They would get a big reputation hit and stocks would fall, but financially they would be fine.

\&gt;  This is why mature gaming companies like EA don't follow that strategy. 

EA is the odd one. Can you provide other examples? Blizzard has 5 franchises (Warcraft, WOW, Starcraft, Hearthstone, Overwatch) vs CD Projekt 3 (Witcher, Cyberpunk, Gwent), Bethesda 2 (Fallout, Elder Scrolls). I fail to see a huge difference.

\&gt;  Do you have figures to back this up? 

Whole Warsaw Stock Exchange had  1 081 719 million PLN stock turnover over last 5 years. CD Projekt had total stock turnover of 35 768 million PLN in the same period. CD Projekt had **3%** of the total turnover ot the Warsaw Stock Exchange in that period. Sources:

\&gt;  Do you know that this is real trading and not ""churn"" between between traders manipulating the price in a market with **unsophisticated** regulators? 

Poland had no economic crisis since 1991. Unlike most of the rest of the world. Our regulators are sophisticated enough it seems ;) Our regulations were quite strict and neither 2008 subprime debt crisis nor 2010 euro crisis touched us. It's funny how people are basing on stereotypes and assume what they don't know must suck. Most of the turnover on CD Projekt is individual investors at any rate, so it's very unlikely it's caused by manipulation.

\&gt;  high stock turnover by Polish standards is still very low by global ones

I couldn't find EA total stock turnover for last 5 years, but I could find average volume for last 3 months, and it was  **2.74M**

Multiplied by the stock price of  415.58 PLN (108 USD) - it makes average stock turnover of  1 138 689 200. CD Projekt has about **2.5%** of turnover of EA daily.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/eepb28/cd_projekt_stock_has_jumped_21000_this_decade/fbxxjs3/,ajuc,1577203082

&gt;*Dear Sirs,*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Thank you for your letter. I regret that I am not clear as to what you intend by arisch. I am not of Aryan extraction: that is Indo-Iranian; as far as I am aware none of my ancestors spoke Hindustani, Persian, Gypsy, or any related dialects. But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of Jewish origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the eighteenth century from Germany......*

So your whole just store it as heat concept is now in the bin too. Its delusional to think we'll electrify everything. Its totally undoable especially for the heating sector. The seasonal variations are totally unmanagable to electrify in that sector. Furthermore electric heating is [significantly more expensive than nuclear](https://i.imgur.com/pGkycGQ.jpg).
