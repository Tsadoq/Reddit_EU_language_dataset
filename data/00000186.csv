Well two countries can have treaties acknowledging each other as existing but it doesn't answer why either exists in the first place.  International law?

First off, the article is about two (2) german cities where the pre-school assesment had the worse result german-wide, namely berlin and duisburg. It doesn't mention how the statistic looks german-wide, just the two worst examples.

Second. The defencies are also over-blown. It's not ""can't hold a pencil"" and ""can't speak german"".

Duisburg had a horrible result for language-skills:

Percentage of kids that could speak german &gt;""without mistakes"" was measured to be only  8,2%.

16.4% couldn't speak german at all: that's not the majority. Half of all measured kids had migration backgrounds.

In Berlin motoric-skills were a problem:

A third had trouble with pencil-holding, using scissors and dealing with numbers. It's worded as ""strong deficits"" in the article.

Also not a majority.

402,"&gt;How similar are Corsica and Sardegna?

Overall, I'd say we're somewhat similar islands that share similar problems and mindset, but a long time of isolation led us to grow apart in terms of political and cultural influences.

&gt;Are the independist movements there liked (aka make a new nation with both island) or completely separate?

They're mostly separate, even though they used to take inspiration from each other (the Corsican Action Party in the '20s, for example, was none other than a Corsican version of the older Sardinian Action Party, which in turn started off to emulate Ireland's path towards self-determination). In the end the Corsican movement, albeit younger, proved to be more successful than the Sardinian one, because of a series of events that would be difficult to describe in a single post (the fascist experience in Italy, the autonomy statute, the Sardinian Action party breaking apart into small fragments etc.), and definitely more violent as well (the ""autonomy"", as watered-down as it was, did indeed serve to placate the moderate Sardists, with the extremist ones becoming little more than bandits).

That being said, [there has been talks about a Corsican-Sardinian macro-region in Europe](http://www.lanuovasardegna.it/regione/2016/04/29/news/sardegna-e-corsica-in-europa-da-alleate-1.13387565), a project following the Tyrolean one which I personally find very interesting.",Sardinia,/r/europe/comments/ao240g/a_new_map_of_italy/efyu25g/,Nepente,1549569756

&gt;But he was not considered white by the United States government. Why? He carried with him the blood of his “Mongolian” ancestors. This meant he could not become a citizen.


Yes, actually, Finns were fucking considered white by the government of the United States. Yes, they had became citizens for hundreds of years before that incident that happened in 1908. No, they weren't considered as ""Mongoloids"" by the US government in any part of the American history. What actually happened was that one lawyer in Minnesota tried arguing why John Svan shouldn't become a citizen. Why? Because he just arranged an enormous mining strike in a crucial mine for the nation's economy, located in Minnesota. It was the one of the firsts, if not the first, fight for workers right in Minnesota and it attracted a lot of attention. It lasted for two months and 15 000 workers participated. They protested the inhumane working conditions and shitty pay. Most strikers were Finns and members of Finnish Socialist Federation.


So they wanted him gone, and they did (or the person hired to do that, a man called John E. Sweet) everything in their power to make it happen. And this racial aspect they tried using was far from being the only way they tried bullying and scaring John Svan and the other sixteen Finnish workers.


In fact, Finns in general were acting in a way that was really hitting a nerve. They were uncomfortably and uncontrollably vocal about worker's rights, they were way too eager and active in the labor union, they were way too eager to organize, they just in general were enormous troublemakers. Finns were blacklisted, there was massive trashing campaigns against them. Finnish maids used to be top notch and most wanted, they had the reputation of being the most hardworking and excellent cooks, and then, bam, a propaganda machine kicks off a campaign telling everyone not to trust them, not to hire them, not to be friends with them, because they are anti-American dirty communist. 



And here you are, a bit more than a hundred years later, on a thread about Finno-Ugrics and what you apparently want to bring out, what is the most relevant thing for you to comment, is quoiting one of the tools of prosecution and the witch hunt used against those Finns who fought for their rights. And oh boy, don't you fucking go and do it by embracing it as an actual truth. And how did you get to a point where you completely left the context out of the picture and straight away state untrue claims? By quoiting a blog called lawyersgunsmoneyblog. Did you spend a minute to research about something an American wrote that should have been, I don't know, painfully fucking obviously untrue to you (_how_ do you not know that Finns had left to America for hundreds of years before that?). 


I will never understand why, _why_ I keep seeing this same narrative and _that same fucking blog_. By Finns. This is your history to the point you speak as in ""we were"" and this is the amount of respect you give to it? Maybe this is just you and all the others feeling like the 4chan memes are a reliable source of education, maybe you just really enjoy that sweet tiny victimhood r/Suomi tends to love so insanely much, I don't know, but I am officially done with writing this same comment, over and over and over again. Start doing seconds worth of research before you post in the internet, especially in part where many people genuinely come to receive education and end up registering bits read in here as facts. Thank you. Yes I am dead tired, going to sleep now and yes I will probably regret the unpolite tone of this in the morning, but this level of ignorance I keep seeing doesn't make me only frustrated, it makes me almost angry.

590,"without context that makes sense.

but the context is that our(dutch) government is doing way too little. even besides political opinions(I'm more leftwing, current government is rightwing, and for years the government has put more priority into economic growth than into reducing our environmental impact), they're not performing their duty.

the issue is that our government agreed to fight climate change within certain limits, by signing the paris-agreements. so despite them valueing economic growth more, they should live up to these promises, otherwise they shouldn't have signed at all(and we could have protested to make them sign it anyway).

however, the news currently is we're not going to make the 2020 goals. an environmental organisation sued the government, and won. instead of making new plans to abide by the 2020 goals, instead our government did nothing to fight climate change, instead they appealed the court case. this year, a higher court again ruled in favor of the environmental organisation.

now the government is saying there's too little time before 2020 to make the climate goals without massive sacrifices that would hurt the economy, so they still refuse to work on it, argueing their plans are focussed on making the 2050 goals and that should be enough. 

however imo that's just gross negligence on the part of our government. they agreed to these goals themselves. they already lost the court case in 2015, if they had taken action back then it would've been much easier to make the goals with minimal economic impact.

but now we're in a situation where the gpvernment won't reach it's own goals, due to it's own negligence, and they hide behind weak excuses('the economy grew more than we expected, so co2 emmisions rose more too' 'doing anything now would hurt our economy too much'  'we're just recovering from an economic crisis, now is not the time to think about climate' 'we're reaching the 2050 goals, so what's the big deal?' )",,/r/europe/comments/ao31b4/dutch_students_skipping_their_school_to_protest/efyjxi0/,droppepernoot,1549563184

698,"&gt; Yes, we're at a late stage of the current business cycle and moving to a downturn. The Fed has already started tightening in the US, which is how downturns always start.

The problem with Europe is that the Eurozone is still at zero interest rates. If we turn down from here, they will not be able to do much. The Fed is still in a bit better spot in comparison.

This is the exact problem Ray Dalio discusses in his 2018 book *Big Debt Crises*. He argues that there is a short term debt cycle and a long term debt cycle. The ST one is the business cycle that sees the central banks stimulating the economy during a downturn and raising interest rates during an expansion. But each cycle depletes the central bank's ammunition for fighting the next downturn by some margin. The LT cycle is the accumulation of several ST cycles. Its final stage is reached when it gets to the point that the central bank has exhausted its abilities to stimulate the economy once a downturn happens. 

This very much seems to be where Europe is right now. The ECB has just stopped its QE programme, and interest rates are still at a minimum. They don't have a lot to work with save for extraordinary measures like outright buying assets like stocks in the open market like BOJ does.

&gt; On 13 November 1918, German-Austria asked Germany to start negotiations of union and on 15 November sent a telegram to President Wilson to support union of Germany and Austria. This was grounded in the view that Austria had never been a nation in the true sense. While the Austrian state had existed in one form or another for over 700 years (dating to the Holy Roman Empire), its only unifying force had been the Habsburgs. Apart from being German-inhabited, these Lands had no common ""Austrian"" identity. They were Habsburg-ruled lands that had not joined the Prussian-dominated German Empire after the Austrian Empire lost the Austro-Prussian War.

&gt; On 12 March 1919, the Constituent Assembly re-confirmed an earlier declaration that German-Austria was a constituent part of the German republic. Pan-Germans and Social Democrats supported the union with Germany, while Christian Socialists were less supportive.

&gt; During spring and summer of 1919, unity talk meetings between German and Austrian representatives continued. All this changed after 2 June 1919 when the draft peace treaty with Austria was presented, which demonstrated that the Western Allies were opposed to any union between Germany and Austria.

The UK is yet to come to Brussels with a clear mandate, with a clear and stable majority in the house of commons on what kind of deal and future relationship it wants. So far all they've done is voted against things, but they haven't come with a clear democratically supported mandate of what the British people want (because currently this doesn't exist).   


There is no point of the EU supporting an extension of article 50 unless:

*  Ms. May comes with a clear mandate (supported by a strong and stable majority) on what kind of future relationship they want (so the backstop is not needed, as rules around trade and customs over the Irish border can be based on this).
* There are reasons to believe that such a strong mandate might develop in the future, by calling a referendum or new elections. 

So far the government party in the UK has refused to even speak to the leader of the opposition in order to come up with plan for the desired future relationship between the EU and the UK, which is why it's failing to come to Brussels with a clear mandate.

&gt;No. The point of sovereignty is that you can decide for yourself.

In theory, yes. But if you can't enforce it your theoretical sovereignty is spent sucking up to larger powers, that's teh point.

If you haven't noticed, the economic critiques of everyone from Bernie Sanders (see his interview with Ezra Klein before he installed the latest woke capitalism update) to Tucker Carlson (in his debate with Charlie Kirk) are actually sounding leftist, even as they implicitly require immigration policies that are rightist.

If you haven't noticed everyone from the Koch Bros to George Soros are advancing a vision of the world where the opposite is the case; i360/Koch Industries have outright split with the Republican Party over this, finding common cause with Literally Soros.

&gt;pretend doing so can only be a result of a brainwashing conspiracy

It is implied here:

&gt;The problem that the EU had (and in fact still has) to solve is that shared memories, traditions, myths, symbols and values possess different meanings in different European nation-states.

'Solving' this problem means destroying the identities that induce different perspectives.

Your flair reads: ""Europe, in the province DE""

As though over 1000 years of German history is 'provincial' and not the story of the struggles and triumphs and tribulations of a unique people within their own clade of the Indo-European language family, rooted in a place, defined in manner and culture and origin, who are *not* French, who are *not* Scottish, who are *not* Hungarian, etc. who are and alone can be *German*.

Only by erasing what it means to be German and not French, and French but not German, will Germans and French cease to have ""memories, traditions, myths, symbols and values"" which ""possess different meanings"", because there will no longer be Germans or French - just Europeans.

This deracination, this uprooting and bleaching and processing of human spirit is revolting to me.

So what I understand is you believe low skilled migrants are better than relying on native workers because even though they on average make 20% less money, they’re forced to pay for welfare programs that they cannot fully access? That does not sound fair at all. The fact that almost 1/10th of the population also sees reduced wages is just the cherry on top of the cake.

I understand there is a net benefit to society, but I don’t think you’re showing us the full picture here. That benefit is overwhelmingly captured by the upper percentiles, while you admit yourself that the bottom tenth see their incomes eroded.

That's not how it works. Certainly not in a couple decades. Except in video games for children in their 20's, maybe. Here in the real world we had and have rather long-lived multicultural empires who never even came close to a homogeneous culture, ethnicity, language.

The age of cultural homogeneity is over anyway, the introduction of mass literacy killed it. We all live in highly diversified pluralist societies nowadays, where every single person has to fulfil plenty of roles, and they all come with their own according cultures and subcultures. What do I have in common with the 53 yo construction trailer bigshot who lives on the other side of the road, hobbies alcohol, weed, sportsball and being angry at sportsball fans from other districts? Absolutely nothing. Doesn't matter where he's born or which language he speaks.

The far-right fringe usually has this simple hick-town farmboy idea of culture, in which identity, ethnicity, culture, tradition and religion are not only one and the same thing, but also identical for every single citizen of hick town and ideally all the rest of hick land. This model made sense in the primitive circumstances of the 18th and 19th century, but nowadays it's just a sign of poor education. Of being American or some other form of far-right reactionary.

1099,"Ok, I will try to respond to your reply point by point, hoping I don't miss out on anything. 

1) From the Eastern European countries, Romania was the only one with a legitimate reason to attack the USSR. Hungary or Bulgaria simply hopped on that train, Romania instead had a logical motive for doing so. Therefore, it was normal that Romania would send a larger number of troops in the Barbarossa operation, not to mention that Romania was also much larger in terms of population than either Hungary or Bulgaria. We weren't already in the best relations with Russia and that occupation of Bessarabia only made Romanians dislike them even more. So yes, when it was announced that the Axis troops will cross the Prut river into Moldova, Romanians were happy about it. However, my point is that what happened beyond the Dniester river was more important to the Nazi Romanian government of the time (let me remind you that Antonescu was not even voted by the people) than it was to the average Romanian. Romania never had any claims on Odessa or other cities in Ukraine and the average Romanian couldn't really care much about it. I said it and I will say it again, it was a mistake for sure, I don't justify it in any way. Yugoslavia was different by all means to Romania. They had no real reason to join Germany, they were the enemy of Germany since WW1 and also big fans of Russia. 

2) I've never said the US should start a war for Eastern Europe. You only go to the extremes: it's either no support at all or full out war. No, there are other ways of doing it. The Romanian anti-communist resistance was one of the longest in Eastern Europe, lasting up until the late 60s. The US and the West in general simply took for granted the Soviets' wish to control Eastern Europe and never said a thing. Just like the US is so good at influencing the politics of the Middle East or South America, I'm sure they would've found a way too. Not to mention that Romania was one of the rebellious Warsaw pact countries even politically speaking, not following the Soviet lead in many situations. However, I understand that if the West didn't consider Poland worth saving, Romania was a lost cause already.

3) You make a confusion between the rulers of Romania and the Romanian people. Antonescu was not elected by the people and he sure did hate Jews. Romanians were anti-Semitic too, I cannot deny it, but I don't recall any mass murders against Ukrainians. In fact, many Ukrainians said that they'd rather be occupied by the Romanian army than the German one. Also, the Romanian people sure didn't care much about Ukrainians, we were just neighbours and that's it basically.

1100,"Mate, increase in the total population doesn't mean a sizeable portion haven't been annihilated. Sorry.

I'm not even claiming that there was a genocide.

No, annihilation doesn't mean the overall population being decreasing.

No, a genocide doesn't require an overall decrease in the population. There are acts who are defined a genocide without any sizeable decrease or even a decrease. Go and read the legal definition.

&gt; This does not make sense. There is no genocide if the population does not vary. A population growth is obviously proof of the absence of genocide, since genocide is the disappearance of the population.

Again, you're making up definitions.

&gt; The Armenian genocide is internationally recognised and the fact that the Turks deny it and a very strong motivation for France and the EU to commemorate it.

Nope. Only strong motivation for French govt is boosting its support from French Armenians. Under normal circumstances, it'd be about France having an Armenian population, yet of course the latest move have another motive as well. 

Turkey denying genocide isn't also the thing making EU countries and such to care about that. Otherwise, they'd be more vocal about genocides of the US and Russia. ",An Adjar born in Tuscany,/r/europe/comments/anjzjf/french_president_emmanuel_macron_has_announced/efxekab/,adjarteapot,1549519345
1101,"By the time Romania officially joined the Axis, there was no question that it was going to join them or be occupied- more than it had been already, with Germany's pals Bulgaria and Hungary having been awarded a stretch of land approximately equivalent in size to what the Soviets had taken. Half a million Germans were already in the country, which was not an uncommon situation for a country in Europe to find themselves in in those days. What was uncommon was how willingly Romania jumped into the role of Germany's attack dog and how little resistance there was. Romania was one of if not the single biggest contributor of non-German Axis manpower on the Eastern Front. It fought from Odessa to Crimea on all the way out to Stalingrad and back until Soviets had returned to the very border. All this way, the Germans freely took Romanian oil to fuel their war machines without paying hardly anything for it, Romanians were used as cannon fodder- and yet, for all that you say it didn't have the support of Romanians, that held on for right up until the Soviets were basically breaking down the door. Contrast this with Yugoslavia, where the government signed an Axis pact because they were scared and thought they could no longer remain neutral; they were ousted two days later in a coup following mass demonstrations because they were so greatly despised for it.

Bear in mind also that while you are excusing this enthusiastic Romanian participation with the Nazis as 'the logical thing to do', you are also complaining that the US and other powers did not leap in to declare war against the Soviet Union or whatever it is that you mean by ""provide international support"" to save poor Romania while they are at the same time fighting a war together with a large military power on the opposite side of the planet. You know, the one whose attack was the reason that the US joined the war in the first place. If we think 'logically', what reasons do you have for why the US should divert away its main focus and spit in the eye of its ally that's about to join in attacking Japan to try to salvage [this hopeless situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Unthinkable#/media/File:Allied_army_positions_on_10_May_1945.png) favorably for the likes of Romania with violence?

The rulers of Romania at the time *despised* Jews and Ukrainians, as can be seen in statements such as this.

&gt;… With the risk of not being understood by some traditionalists which may be among you, I am in favour of the forced migration of the entire Jew element from Bessarabia and Bukovina, which must be thrown over the border. Also, I am in favor of the forced migration of the Ukrainian element, which does not belong here at this time. I don't care if we appear in history as barbarians. The Roman Empire has made a series of barbaric acts from a contemporary point of view and, still, was the greatest political settlement. There has never been a more suitable moment. If necessary, shoot with the machine gun. (This quote can be found in ""The Stenograms of the Ministers' Council, Ion Antonescu's Government"", vol. IV, July–September 1941 period, Bucharest, year 2000, page 57) (Stenogramele şedinţelor Consiliului de Miniştri, Guvernarea Ion Antonescu, vol. IV, perioada iulie-septembrie 1941, Bucureşti, anul 2000, pagina 57).

There are many worse quotes I can find, but I think this one can give the gist. If you care to read it (it is in English as well as Romanian), I have a link to [the report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania](https://www.yadvashem.org/docs/international-commission-on-romania-holocaust.html) which details this:

&gt; The number of Romanian Jews and of Jews in the territories under Romania’s control who
were murdered during the Holocaust has not been determined with final precision. However, the
Commission concludes that between 280,000 and 380,000 Romanian and Ukrainian Jews were
murdered or died during the Holocaust in Romania and the territories under its control. An additional
135,000 Romanian Jews living under Hungarian control in Northern Transylvania also perished in the
Holocaust, as did some 5,000 Romanian Jews in other countries. Referring to Romania, Raul Hilberg
concluded that “no country, besides Germany, was involved in massacres of Jews on such a scale.” 

&gt; Between 45,000 and 60,000 Jews were killed in Bessarabia and Bukovina by Romanian and
German troops in 1941. Between 105,000 and 120,000 deported Romanian Jews died as a result of the
expulsions to Transnistria. In Transnistria between 115,000 and 180,000 indigenous Jews were killed,
especially in Odessa and the counties of Golta and Berezovka. At least 15,000 Jews from the Regat
were murdered in the Iasi pogrom and as a result of other anti-Jewish measures. Approximately
132.000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz in May-June 1944 from Hungarian-ruled Northern
Transylvania. Detailed information about the origin of these statistics, the calculation, and references
are provided in the relevant chapters of the report. 

These numbers don't even include non-Jewish Ukrainians as that is not a part of the scope of the report; the numbers are in fact worse than those appalling figures because, [as the at hand Einsatzgruppe D was disappointed by](https://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/bukowinabook/buk2_070.html), Romanian occupiers were in many cases more concerned by eliminating Ukrainians than Jews.

I think you’re taking this the wrong way... I’m not saying that the EU is some secret plan make everything into one and create one race and all that. I think it’s the likely result from all the freedoms an increasing amount of people enjoy around the world and i celebrate that. 

I think we agree that the “end goal” is to have as many people as possible enjoy the freedoms of the western world. Freedom of expression, freedom of movement and the opportunity to vote on their own personal views. Now what I think happened in 2015 and will continue to happen in the future is that people in less well of countries in the Middle East discovered that staying in their home country country doesn’t for them or their families. Because they face war and poverty. And they realized that by their humanity they’re entitled to move to a new place, apply for asylum and get a shot at hugely increasing their quality of life. That’s a great thing!! 

Now if more people come to, for example, Europe from all over the world with different ethnicities and cultures... people are going to use the freedoms they have and marry whoever they want, express themselves however they want and practice whatever culture they want. Which again... I’m all for! 

Now given 150 or maybe even 200 years it’s only a question of time till all the cultures and ethnicities eventually become one. And since the world is moving closer together this development will not only happen in Europe but all over the world. 

I see that as a sign of progress and I’d be proud to have been part of the beginning of a world where the borders between people like ethnicity, culture, language and religion all mesh into one diverse new culture. It’s a sign that humans for the first time in history might create a true global society with a true global goal. Then things like the colonization of Mars or sth like that become realistic since there is no risk of one country destroying the other... since you know... they’re all one. Why would they destroy each other. 

There’s people that don’t like this idea because they want to protect they’re culture or their ethnicity or whatever... but I don’t think that’s the route history is taking. I’d rather take the route of cultural understanding and mixing.

1154,"&gt; in what way?

Well right now in most Western European countries we have delegated too much power, authority and responsibilities to the government. The government is for all intents and purposes the protector and provider, the husband, the father and the alpha male.

This is through the welfare system, family courts and police force. Some of this authority should be given back to the husband, along with the accompanying responsibilities. This is part of why we have so many manchildren in the West, me included. The risk/cost/reward calculation is very unfavorable, there is simply not enough incentive to take responsibility.

Having the government as the provider has also increased the phenomenon of single parenting (most often single motherhood), which typically results in lower fertility rates.

Then cheating and divorce are not taboo anymore. There are no legal or social consequences in most Western countries for cheating on your spouse. Divorce isn't frowned upon, in fact it is often encouraged. It should be more difficult to divorce and cheating (especially while married) should carry some kind of penalty.

&gt;the first part is already being done, (IIRC I've seen ads from NL) 

What is being promoted and incentivized is the career mom single mother.

&gt;Yeah that worked so well in Romania and in other places where it was practiced.

The fact is that it does increase fertility rates. Everything has its upsides and downsides.

&gt;which one?

Christianity and possibly some European pagan religions.

&gt;and most of them are directly opposed to personal liberty

The more the hegemony of European cultures decline because of low fertility and foreign (mainly islamic) migration, the less personal liberties you will have anyway.

In Slovenia 1945 holds for both sexes not only women. Before that we had 30 years of monarchy and before that in the Austrian Empire voting rights for men had a tax requirement. In 1873 only 12% of men were able to vote. I doubt that percentage scaled for the different nationalities. But no one seems to care about such historical facts. We only ever hear about women.

1202,"&gt; The problem doesn’t lie with ethnicity or genetics

I think that is part of the problem. First of all, humans tend to gravitate towards people who are similar to themselves, it's called [in-group bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_favoritism).

Why do we have this in-group bias? Because ethnocentric cooperation is the [most effective survival strategy](http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/16/3/7.html).

Second is IQ levels. Some studies conclude IQ is about 80% genetic and 20% environmental (childhood nutrition, education etc). A certain level of IQ is required to function in an advanced society. For example the US military will not recruit anyone with an IQ below 81, and only 20% of enlisted recruits can have an IQ between 81 and 93.

Many African countries have an AVERAGE IQ below 81. This means they will find it difficult, perhaps impossible to participate in our Western societies in the same way as people with a higher IQ. These people will become a permanent underclass and contribute to poverty, welfare dependence and crime. And there is not much we can do about it.

In fact while we in the West have been able to maximize our environmental IQ, it is also possible that our ""genetic"" IQ is decreasing. This is largely due to the welfare system and feminism. Welfare is incentivizing poor people with a lower IQ to reproduce, while feminism is encouraging high IQ women to pursue careers instead of procreating.",,/r/europe/comments/anwjqx/germanys_past_president_joachim_gauck/efx7n2a/,kattbollar,1549512366

1300,"&gt;Spot-on! It has been lingering since almost exactly a year ago. Why didn't they introduce it back then? Because Germany had already issued the necessary permisions to build the pipeline - after all, that's why it's built as we speak! - and the EU itself was well aware that either changing rules or applying said rules to projects to which they didn't apply up to that point would create legal and financial liabilities.

Well arguably Germany thought that it could prevent a rule change, it now seems it can't. And again, this is simply about applying the same regulations to EU/3rd Country pipelines to internal pipelines. On the face of it that seems reasonable (and obviously falls well within the EU competencies).   The chance could have happened a year ago, or it could happen in a year from now, the impact is broadly the same, the ownership structures would have to change.

And yes ,it creates liabilities, but so do most regulatory changes, and especially changes where the EU decides to regulate in areas where it hasn't before. It's how the EU works (indeed this kind of thing is one of the arguments I've used in the past about how the EU is problematic and why the UK is better off leaving it..).

&gt;That why France, among others, has always resisted to vote in favour of it. Let' not forget that they would likely face the same liabilities, since a French company is part of the project as well.

I'm not sure that that's particularly relevant, clearly France now (and many others previously) have had all sorts of problems with NS2. But lets face it, this regulatory approach isn't particularly egregious as far as regulatory approaches go. To a certain extent being subject to the possibility that regulations change like this is simply part and parcel of EU membership and having a joint approach to regulation. Germany could have mitigated it a year ago, it didn't and now there may well be an issue. 

&gt;And that's exactly what it is. A sudden change of policy out of the blue isn't something you see every day, let alone between France and Germany.

It might be, it might also be a legitimate change in position. France has increasingly seen Russia and NS2 as a potential risk, if you throw in Germany's approach on NS2 it gets murky. 

&gt;My guess is: They won't vote against it. But they showed their hand to bring it across that their votes shouldn't just be taken for granted in Germany.

As I said, I wouldn't be surprised. But there are also a few arguments against it, the major one being that if France pushed this, pulled together more EU members (as is likely if it is assumed France will back it) and then pulled out, it'll cause France some major issues at the EU level. In short, it'd make it massively more difficult for France to pull together support for the changes it wants at the EU level, people don't like being left holding the bag.

1304,"Not a bad way of looking at things I suppose. It just raises 3 questions in my head:

- Would it be possible to reintroduce faith into modern european society within a reasonable timeframe? 

- Would it be possible to... y'know, skim off the fat - as in, unnecessary dogma - and just keep the good stuff (ie. more fucking, less talking)?

- Would a society like that even be worth it? 

The last one is the real doozy. In my opinion, modern european society is about as good as culture has gotten in world history. Not so much because we rule, it's just that others kind of suck more and those that only suck a little bit less also have a problem with babymaking. 

Instead of looking backwards we could just look at new ways to go forward like, I don't know, a less family unit oriented approach. Have professional babymakers, modernize the concept of orphanages, let's pay Hollywood to pump out 15 tube-baby blockbuster movies every summer.

Just imagine! No antivaxxer parents, no religious parents, no racism because we just pay all types of women to be babymakers because we know what matters is parenting and culture not skin color so we can't even be called racist for it!

Also, all the things I said are about the actions of the LGBTQ advocates, not the people itself.

And to see what they want, and how they intend to do it here you go, clear as daylight.

https://www.ilga-europe.org/what-we-do/our-advocacy-work/hate-crime-hate-speech


This is just one, of many, such organizations that use authoritarian censorship, data collecting and law definition to attack and assault free speech and religious people that may commit ""hate crimes"" in speech or online against the LGBTQ movement.


Also, I don't need your credit. I know who you are and what you do here. We don't see eye, authoritarians and radicals and me have nothing to share or give credit to.



So far UK, apparently still a member of the EU and Germany have already arrested and convicted people based on the new definition of ""hate speech"" directed against LGBTQ people.

They also did this for ""hate speech"" against Islam, but never for ""hate speech"" against Christians.

A clear difference in attitude is that most reported ""hate speech"" that target Christians are erased from the data and not prosecuted.

The simple fact that the ""hate speech"" laws are endorsed by the LGBTQ activists (and in many cases created and supported, lobbied and celebrated) is a clear sign of their authoritarian non-humanist, anti free speech path.


It is hard not to see the issue (except if you're a zealot).

If such laws where in place before the LGBTQ acceptance, then those laws could be used to attack and block the LGBTQ movement.


For example, if ""hate speech"" laws defined ""homosexuality propaganda"" as ""hate speech"" then the LGBTQ movement could never exist.

The sick and twisted thing here is that these ""hate speech"" appear only after the LGBTQ is accepted and only in it's favor (surprise, freedoms for me, jail time for my opponents).


Imagine that tomorrow, a scientist discovers that a gene defect stands between homosexuality and heterosexuality, and offers a treatment for all pregnant women.

While without the LGBTQ definitions of ""hate speech"" this could be seen as ""progress"", with the enforced radical ""hate speech"" laws, this scientific discovery will be deemed to be ""hate"" and censored.



Imagine that tomorrow, no, today, a transitioned Tran-sexual men come out to say ""we did a mistake"", and decide to write a book about it, to warn others not to do the same mistake.

While this will be normally accepted and celebrated as a genuine discourse among non-binary people, on things affecting their particular gender issues, with the new ""hate speech"" laws, his book is censored for ""hate speech"".


Once the LGBTQ advocates got some victories, they quickly closed down any debate and silenced their opposition using ""hate speech"" (such a clear term yesterday that today define anything from opposition to science, from comedy to political discourse).



The only ones that promote, advocate and lobby for ""hate speech"" laws in Europe are the LGBTQ advocates. 

Sadly, the same laws protect the radical religious nuts in the Islamic laws, as any type of opposition or critique of the status-quo is deemed to be ""hate speech"".



On short, the valiant liberal and humanist fight for ""rights"" quickly transformed itself in a Marxist oppressive fight against ""the enemy"" and even against ""contra revolutionaries"" in a classic post-revolutionary movement.

1621,"Unlike in the UK and Europe, there are no minimum space requirements for breeding chickens in the US. America also does not have any rules governing lighting levels in the sheds and, crucially, its farms have no maximum allowed level of ammonia, which indicates how much urine and faecal matter is present. This means there is no limit on how much can fester inside the sheds.
US chickens have more than tripled in size since 1957, according to academic studies. The birds cost 20 per cent less than British chickens, which are typically one third smaller than US birds. Major poultry producers have cross-bred and interbred birds in recent decades to create 'mutant' chickens which grow larger in a shorter space of time and need less feed.

Peter Stevenson, chief policy adviser for British-based welfare organisation Compassion in World Farming, said: 'This genetic engineering has created unnatural chickens which give you larger breasts or bigger cuts of meat.

'These chickens grow far too large too quickly and they cannot move around. They end up sitting in their own waste.'

The animals bring more faecal matter to the slaughterhouse with them, posing the food safety risk which requires the birds to be washed in chlorine or similar chemicals. However, the US poultry industry maintains that its birds are healthier than ever.

Being washed in chlorine is one of the major NO when it comes to importing US chicken",,/r/europe/comments/anpu3f/polish_suspect_meat_was_being_sold_in_the_czech/efw5i0n/,Alphax1983,1549483560

Third, yes i can image it, because invasive species are a fact. Every where on this planet.

&gt;All that Islamist crap started with the US meddling in the middle east, you/they can pay for your own shit you started yourself.

The Middle East's instability started

a.) With the Bronze Age Collapse and Sea Peoples

b.) The invention of Islam

c.) The invasion by Mongols

d.) The Crusades

e.) The dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and the formation of Sykes-Picot

f.) The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company

g.) The Balfour Declaration by the UK

h.) The creation of the state of Israel, first recognized by the US and USSR

i.) The Soviet War in Afghanistan

j.) The American Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan

As far as I see, we are responsible for H, J, and nothing else. 

&gt;We have nuclear weapons, nobody is gonna attack the West, that would be obvious suicide.

Which is why Russia is trying its best to destabilize us via underhanded means right now. This is the sort of thing NATO (or PESCO) needs to be upgraded to handle: cyberwarfare. You know Ukraine had a lot of nuclear weapons before disarming them willingly in 1994 right? They ate up Russian propaganda bait and sinker, and now they're suffering the consequences. It can happen to any country, even the USA, if we allow ourselves to trust the Russian government.

No, as in any welfare state, they go on welfare. That's the core conflict between ""free movement"" and ""welfare state"" IMO. A country with a welfare state ([like the USA, we have an effective tax rate that's higher than the so-called nanny state UK](https://taxfoundation.org/comparison-tax-burden-labor-oecd-2016/)) should have near-closed borders. A country without a welfare state is free to have as much immigration as it wants without any negative consequences, since immigrants have to fend for themselves (which is what the USA did 1776-1910 ish).

2) Agree to some sort of cu sm deal. Following the same rules every other member follows. 

3) Dont leave. 

If the UK had gone into the refferendum with a clear idea of weather they wanted 1 or 2 vs 3. The assuming leave still won we would have spent 2 years agreeing to that. And if 1 knowing where we stood looking into replacing those parts of the EU we needed.

1684,"Your elaborated post is on the right track but you've made some statements that are inaccurate - I've corrected the main ones below:

1. **Google app bundle required - SOMEWHAT TRUE.** The issue was that Google was shipping Android ""for free"" if companies used the bundled Google apps, Chrome, Search, and Play Store. BUT, if they didn't want to include those apps they had to pay for Android. This was seen as anti-competitive to competing browser/app developers because manufacturers had financial pressure to bundle the Google apps with the devices.

2. **Using other operating systems - MOSTLY FALSE.** Google was restricting all access to the Play Store and their apps if a manufacturer was also making devices that shipped with an ""Android Fork"" (what the Amazon Kindle tablets use). The main argument from Google's side is that it poses a security concern if you run the play store on forked devices, but it's not clear why they would lock that company out completely on non-forked devices instead of just blocking forked Android from using the Play Store. Either way, this applies an significant pressure to not ship other versions because Play apps are so key to the Android ecosystem, and without them users are less likely to buy your product. *Manufacturers were (are) free to use other non-android operating systems like Windows Phone if they wanted.* (The exception was manufacturers making phones for China because Google can't operate there anyway.)

3. **Linux as an open platform comparison - INACCURATE.** The Linux kernel is an open platform, but the most common distributions of Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, Kubuntu, etc) are all modifications of that original platform and will have different strengths and weaknesses. Android is similar; the base kernel is open so you can build whatever you want and distribute it without facing legal backlash. The only real difference is that Linux doesn't have a core app marketplace since you can download software online to install it, so there's no single company that controls the available apps for the different operating systems. Because developers have mostly made their apps only available through the Play Store, it means access to that marketplace is more critical.

1686,"Well it's about how the company will react- its not economics assuming , its sociology I guess. Employee 1 might be worth 1.5X the average of employees 2-21, but if employees 2-21 disagree on the grounds that 1 has the same job title and came in yesterday then the company has a dilema:

They can either:

Pay 1 what they're worth, tell 2-21 to suck it up, then have to deal with dispirited and quarrelling team for the next year

Pay everyone 1.5X the previous salary

Not pay 1 what they're worth, and tell 1 to suck it up, or hire mediocre 22 if 1 doesn't like it. 1 probably has to suck it up, because competitors B-Z also don't want to sow discord in their teams by offering higher than average pay. 

To me it's obvious that in most scenarios the company is gonna go for option 3,as in the real world example I provided in my edit. Employee 1 might be good, but he won't be entire teams output or 50% extra wage cost for team good.

The EU doesn’t HAVE to stabilise any economy. But it does, for political reasons.

If the Irish economy were to tank after Brexit, and the EU didn’t offer help, we might expect the citizens of Ireland to wonder if they would have been better off with an “Irexit”. If they decided to follow the UK, to the imagined land of milk and honey, then the EU is in serious trouble.

The trouble stems from larger economic powers, like Germany, France or Spain, threatening an exit of their own. Smaller nations (Austria, Portugal) intertwined with their economies would look at the British/Irish problem and probably decide they’d be best to follow their major trading partner.

This would be a noose around the neck of the EU.

1744,"&gt; Pure GDP is meaningless to compare how well populations of countries are off, also compering countries with different populations is useless. GDP counts only total production output in giver period. If You realy want to compare countries on basis of GDP it has to be GDP (PPP) per capita, that takes into account population, currency and price levels. And now if You look at France, Poland or Romania that are accordingly 45.000$; 32.000$; 26.000$. So while difference between France and Romania is 19.000$ for Poland it's 13.000$. Now if we extrapolate our calculations on next few years with data from IMF. Poland will probably reach todays France GDP (ppp) per capita (45.000$) in next 4-5 years. So Poland is behind France at most 5 years, not decades. Also long term projections (take it with grain of salt) made by IMF states that this gap will be smaller and smaller each year. We can also look at HDI (Human Development Index) France has 0.901 rate; Poland 0.865; Romania 0.811. 

Poland is one of these Eastern countries that does fairly better than the rest. None of your argumentation is denying that **Eastern European** is **still** behind the West, shifting the argument on exceptions won't makes me wrong. 

Sometimes you just need to deal with facts. PPP calculation is not better, it is different, and doesn't fit for every country, if I remember well. 

As for HDI, it's hard to say how it translates, it uses PPP so it's basically repeating yourself with a different value.

&gt;  I assume You don't tell yourself that France is decades behind Switzerland or Norway in terms of life and wellbeing of population.

Because we aren't chasing them, above a certain threshold that becomes fairly meaningless, Also managing higher population countries is harder than small closed ones. France is also picking choices that aren't that good for it's GDP, but better for the people globally (at least we try, but when I see current gov, I want to bang my head on the wall). I'm okay with not being the richest country in the world, I'd rather try to because the fairest.

These are not differences we should overemphasize (ultimately we are all humans) but neither should we ignore them.

Well, we actually effectively already have ""universal background checks"" as is (if you buy from any retailer, you must pass a background check, regardless of whether it's online, in store, at a gun show, etc), so while it's a popular topic of discussion it's not nearly as bit of a loophole/gap as tends to be presented. There are some things that could probably be improved about the existing system, but it's more nitpicking and less covering gaping holes. Support is widespread even amongst gun owners, though few gun owners really trusts democrats to make an honest attempt at improving the background check system rather than trying to writing something nonsensical.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, at the state level democrats nationwide have introduced all kinds of laws, from assault weapon bans, magazine bans, firearm transport bans, storage laws, ammo bans, ammo background checks, etc. Most of it is poorly written nonsense that just slaps a bunch of fines and forces legal gun owners to jump through all kinds of loopholes to avoid being guilty of felony charges the second the new law takes effect. The Democratic party has learned not to try this stuff at the federal level, because it always backfires in elections, but in California, Washington, New York, etc, they've learned they can run on other issues and push state laws through (and the Supreme Court basically ignored all 2A related lawsuits for over a decade so the legality of a lot of the laws is somewhat questionable).",,/r/europe/comments/anpcge/google_now_pays_more_in_eu_fines_than_it_does_in/efvvhzg/,DarkLink1065,1549476880

* Rhine beakers pre-celt indo-europeans from the Steppe replaced nearly all of british and irish ancestry, this is the population most british ancestry likely descends from (apart from possibly the south english - who may have over 50% celt + saxon + roman/norman + viking input combined.
* In spain 100% of the Y chromosomes where replaced, but only 40% the total DNA, so the beakers bred with the spanish natives, but wiped out the brits on both sides: (remind you of something?)
* We do not know what language these dutch beakers spoke, but it may have been proto north west european, possibly similar to whatever was ancestral to proto-germanic.

Muslims in Europe are also pretty resistant towards integration and embracing liberalism. The second or third generation Muslim migrants are often even more committed then their parents were.

Why is that? My guess is that because Islam is inherently quite a bit more militant and ready to use force to gets its way. Christianity used to be, but the threat of violence steamed largely from the monarchies. Once we replaced monarchies with secular democracies the power of Christianity went way down since there is no threat of violence behind it.

The exact wording is obviously different, however in practice the Sami are the one group who are really allowed to engage in ''renskötsel''. Unless you are part of one of the 51 ''samebyar'' you outright aren't allowed to engage in it. The reason behind it is due to the fact that ''renskötsel'' is a very important part of Sami culture, and as such they get special rights in regards to that to try and preserve Sami culture and let the Sami-people themselves control the evolution of their culture. 

In practice this obviously doesn't make much of a difference to most Swedes, however those who do live in the extreme north are somewhat affected by this and that leads to tension between them and the Sami.





At least that is my basic understanding of how that works, there are probably nuances and such that I miss due to not being from an area where that would make much of a difference, and I can only speak from limited experience from having family in the north and having been there a limited amount of times.

2147,"Start in Lisbon.  DONT get caravan yet!  Stay a few days in Lisbon.  See the typical sites.  The caravan would be hell in Lisbon driving so get it on the way out after you have seen Lisbon.  

THEN get your RV.  You can drive to Cascais only 20 mins away.  Park near Guincho Beach with your RV and you will be literally on the cliffs next to several beaches.  You will see beaches and cool cliffs from your window. It's also free parking off the road. Many RVs do this so you'll meet others traveling like you.   Plus restaurants right there.  Cascais is a beach town really cool downtown and has several awesome bars.  O'Luains Bar is where you will find all the expats from all over on Thursday nights.  Fun place to chat with people from all walks of life.  You will have to take a uber from Guincho to downtown Cascais (5 mins) because parking an RV will be a nightmare.  Plus you wanna drink and save your beautiful spot you parked at Guincho.  

Stay a few days in Cascais at the beach but also take a day trip or two to Sintra. (15 min cab or uber up hill DONT take the RV there in summer the roads are VERY small) then see Regaleira Castle (My fav) see Moorish Castle and Pena Castle.  This will be a all day thing to see all 3 but all 3 are totally different.   Since you have the autocaravan and will be parked at Guincho dedicate 2 days at least to Sintra alone.  Guincho is down the hill from it not far at all only 10 mins.  

Regaliera is very ornate, very beautiful carved stone that looks gothic.  Moorish is an old style castle that the Muslims built when the Moors took over.  Pena Castle is all sorts of cool colors and sits on the very top.  The views from these castles are incredible.  

Then I would drive to Porto. Along the way stop by Nazare (worlds largest waves and world record big wave surf here) stop by Aviero if you have time.  Enjoy the drive along the coast to Porto.  I don't know much about it but its incredible everyone says.  You can spend some time there then drive back down all the way to the Algarve.  This is the bottom of Portugal.  If you like beaches and didnt get a fill in Cascais go here.  

What I love most about Portugal is of all the western European places it seems to be less touched by modernism.  The buildings and streets still have that old feeling.  Food is spectacular and very cheap outside tourist areas.  Make sure to hit up the local family owned restaurants.  Super cheap spectacular food.  (If you like meat try Ginginha Transmontana in Cascais and get the roof tile meat plate) 

I cant stress how cool it is when the auto caravans all park at Guincho Beach.  Surf boards for rent, bikes for rent.  Small beach bars and the autocaravans park facing the water it's so cool.  A friend of mine lives in one and can throw a rock into the ocean from her spots she picks.  It's insanely cool.  If I were you I would park at a good spot there for at least 5 days and see Cascais and Sintra from the.  Just uber to each.  You can also walk the walkway along the coast seeing beautiful cliffs from Guincho Beach to Cascais a few times.  Especially at SUNSET.  I've been to 43 countries and Guincho Beachs sunsets are some of the best.

On the other hand, lots of content on the internet that is currently free and not created for monetisation will continue to be free because the creators want to share it with others.

First of all, Polakis IS a total piece of shit, like almost every other politician in Greece. He is not worst than others though, he is just like them.

Regarding the obvious propaganda, he never doxxed anyone to start with, I don't even know how you came up with that.

Second of all, he never said that he would put people in prison in order to be reelected, at least not in the way you made it sound. He clearly ment that if they start putting CRIMINALS AND CORRUPT POLITICIANS in prison, people will appreciate that and vote for then again. I know it and you know it as well, you are just trying to play dumb on purpose.

Regarding the reporters, he told them exactly what he should. The truth. The media in Greece (except from the national station) are all controlled by the opposition, it's something that was clearly proven with facts during the national referendum, no Greek can deny that, no matter how much they hate Syriza.
I wouldn't talk to a single one of those scumbags either, they always present remote phrases of Syriza's politicians in the way they want.

Judging by the lies you wrote, you are probably a big fan of Portosalte, the most disgusting reporter currently alive, who likes to assume stuff like that all the time and present them at the ""news"" channel he works for.

That channel is live just to spread propaganda against the current government and glorify their opponent party.

It has only been done on Hungary and Poland, and Poland is now backtracking, returning to normal. So there *are* repercussions. The problem is implementing them.  
Most repercussions are implemented *trough a vote* (in the same way a person who breaks a law faces trial). But if Europeans take this ""eh, I don't care about the EU approach"", they won't vote for governments who care about the EU, while the only people who care will care about abolishing the rules of the EU. And the EU *is* the member countries, combined (in the same way society is the citizens, combined). And if in a society, half the citizens do not care about the laws while the other half is actively interested in breaking them, it does not matter how good the laws are or how bad the repercussions are, *the laws simply won't be enforced*.  
  
And even if one thinks the rules are not good or the repercussions are too low, just like when you don't like a law your country has, the solution is not to abolish the country itself, but to become active and vote for representatives that care about making better laws. Same with Europe: if you think it's not doing enough, don't abolish it so that it does nothing, but on the contrary, support it and support people inside it who care so that it actually does something.",May Europe stand together,/r/europe/comments/anixkc/hungary_becomes_first_partly_free_eu_nation_in/efum44v/,TheDigitalGentleman,1549428048

There's another option, though... Our country (Dutch too here) and other countries could leave the EU instead, causing the EU to implode.

And then we can start over again. With a new EU. But this time only with countries that meet all standards *and* with an option to kick out countries that behave anti-democratic.

Consumers on the other hand have access to the tax office website where they can check whether or not the restaurant really billed them and if not they can rat the restaurant out to the tax office. This makes it so restaurants can’t really evade paying taxes out of fear that someone will complain.

On top of that each time you give out your tax number on any bill you get an entry for a lottery. It used to be an expensive car before but now they’re giving out a weekly 35.000€ in government bonds and 3x 50.000€ on the last week of the year.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/anenm0/the_greek_deputy_heath_minister_polakis_smoking/efu0xq4/,011111000101,1549411808

2681,"&gt; The point I'm trying to make is that subjective probability calculations tell us more about the person who answered the questionnaire than it would about the event of which you're trying to guage the probability.

Yeah, thats a fair criticism, but surely you do view some value in the opinions of other who follow the events more closely than yourself? But they do certainly depend on the person giving them, they are essentially a numerical opinion, but the opinions of people do matter with regards to decision making. 

&gt;What I would consider 'actual' or 'real' probability is for example the application of wave function in quantum mechanics to a particle's state - a mathematical model directly calculating probability in an observable event, based on known/measurable variables and properties

Unfortunatly I am not a physisist, so don't follow that point particularly well, but generally speaking the approach is the same, generating a probability from the available data, its just information and methodology is (a lot) weaker admitedly. I would guess that would be the objectivist Baysian approach, creating a probability which evereyone can be expected to arrive at given the same data? If that is your approach then I don't particularly have an argument with you, I am nowhere near eloquent or educated enough to defend the whole school of thought, I will however defend probability's value as a logical tool in decision making. 

&gt;The other option would be to deliver a thorough analysis of the issues at stake, desired outcomes and intentions of both parties, including the consequences for either actor in any decision. It's a more direct analysis, in large part not numerically based. You can attach the words 'very likely, very unlikely' etc to policy outcomes based on the above mentioned analysis for all I care. The drive to attach numerical values and mathematical rationalism to political decision making like this seems more of a crutch to me for people who have trouble dealing with uncertainty and who are indecisive. Rather have the numbers make the decision for you, no matter how we came to them.

The options can be used in tandem, they are similar and complementary. You would use this analysis to inform the generation of these probabilites. Its just that numerical values lets us be more precise about the analysis. Obviously the likelihood is important, I don't think you're denying that (and if you were I would ask why you're not analysing whether or not France will invade the UK). Mathematising it is simply a tool of analysis, it lets you apply logic to your starting estimates to generate results that are logically consistant under your assumptions. Its how you would work out how much you are willing to pay for certain information, or calculating the value of a certain adjustment in likelihood. Ultimatly what it means is that you can say ""I think we should do this becuase ... "" and show workings that state exactly and without ambiguity what your estimates and values are (which can be questioned subjectively), and what your logic is (which cannot). Yes it is a crutch for people who are bad with uncertainty, but that is the entire human race, almost without exception. And decisiveness is only a virtue if you are making good decisions consistantly, otherwise its just rashness. Using the numbers to escape responsibility for the decision is stupid, since you are responsible for what they say (although I won't deny people would try).",,/r/europe/comments/ancz2o/brext_what_happens_next/efu242a/,RedditName6,1549412757

2688,"I absolutely agree. The Chinese high speed network is 10 times bigger than the German network. On the basis of the Chinese domestic market, the Chinese competitor can conquer world markets because of the economies of scale and because of state subsidies. It's just a question of time before the Chinese build railways in Europe, for example in the UK. Even 25 years ago, the market was already international. I remember, for example, how the French bid against the Germans in South Korea in the 1990s.  I have said for over 20 years that Europe will lose its railway industry if we don't create a champion. It may already be too late, the Alstom/Siemens merger should been decided 20 years ago.

2832,"To respond to the comments that inevitably will come:

Yes, Russia definitely does this on all social media it can get its hands on.

Yes, other countries probably do this too, but there are differences. For example, I don't find it convincing to equate the actions of a group from a democratic country (a group which may or may not be directly controlled by the leaders of said country) influencing another democratic country, and the propaganda arm (directly under the control of the leader) of an authoritarian country doing it to a democratic country. 

No, everyone who disagrees with me, or you, is not a bot. But it is damaging to the quality (which is already often very low) of discussions if one side is not just geniunely disagreeing, but a propagandist who is paid to disagree regardless of their own beliefs or the truth based on evidence available to them. If there is a reasonable amount of evidence to suggest that someone is not discussing in good faith, there should be action taken to limit their influence. 

That said, a simple solution to this would be to farm more believeable Internet activity, in which case finding this sort of ""reasonable evidence"" would probably be impossible.

He is also not the first prominent [right-winger](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/31/far-right-afd-member-converted-islam-protest-gay-marriage-acceptance/) that converted lately. It's the realization that Christianity in modern form is really not a great foundation for a stable and prosperous society. It used to be, but then liberalism came along and now it doesn't stand a chance. Islam is on the other hand very resistant to liberalism. Liberalism spread relatively successfully to lots of regions of the world, but it consistently hits a road block in Muslims countries. Most attempts of the West to export liberalism in Muslims resulted in failure and as a result the Muslim society is preserved and it is experiencing a pretty decent growth. 

I suspect that the rate of right-wing conversion to Islam will accelerate, since fighting against it just to preserve liberalism seems oxymoronic. If that transpires then I guess we'll witness the left to start treating Islam as they currently treat Christianity.

Indeed it it. I don't like their views on economy enough, that I won't vote for them unless they are the only one who can prevent someone with even worse views on economy winning.

&gt;that's your opinion. Same way I might that you are a professional reddit troll. Nice but doesn't prove anything

I would be flattered. I mostly lurk and don't really comment much on reddit, and I only've gotten reddit gold like three times during my 7 years here, and yet I would be awarded such a honour.

&gt; they give CONSENT

All their hard work has paid off, and by now they have managed to become public figures. Public figures don't need to be asked for consent every time media want to make a material about them.

&gt;Again, that's your opinion. The time will come, there will be lots of people protesting daily

Any moment now.

&gt;you will call wannabe-celebrities and professionals all of them?

I will decide when, or rather if there actually will be something more to it than the exact same several dozens people being a mild inconvenience to my commute every once in a while.

&gt;evasion, not an answer

It's genuinely interesting to me though.

&gt;your understanding of the law is not important here. Besides, since when does the 1st amendment allow for publication of private data by the press just like that? It doesn't. Law in USA is quite reasonable (as in Europe) - you need consent or public interest to go public with such data. 

Is it?

""In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), the Supreme Court ruled that when a publication involves a public figure, to support a suit for libel the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the publisher acted with actual malice: knew of the inaccuracy of the statement or acted with reckless disregard of its truth.""

Politically things were going well until two years ago when old people elected an extreme right wing, nationalistic, racist, pro-religion party while younger, more liberal folks didn't bother to vote. The government and the Catholic Church are hell-bent on turning Poland into an autocracy and take the country back to 15th century, it seems.

3053,"You haven't got a clue:

&gt;Legal systems sometimes recognize certain limits on or to the freedom of speech, particularly when freedom of speech conflicts with other rights and freedoms, such as in the cases of libel, slander, pornography, obscenity, fighting words, and intellectual property. In Europe, blasphemy is a limitation to free speech.[19][20][21][22] Justifications for limitations to freedom of speech often reference the ""harm principle"" or the ""offense principle"". Limitations to freedom of speech may occur through legal sanction or social disapprobation, or both.[23] Certain public institutions may also enact policies restricting the freedom of speech, for example speech codes at state schools.

&gt;In On Liberty (1859), John Stuart Mill argued that ""...there ought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a matter of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be considered.""[23] Mill argues that the fullest liberty of expression is required to push arguments to their logical limits, rather than the limits of social embarrassment.[24][25][26][27] However, Mill also introduced what is known as the harm principle, in placing the following limitation on free expression: ""the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.""[23] 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech#Limitations

&gt;Article 10 provides the right to freedom of expression, subject to certain restrictions that are ""in accordance with law"" and ""necessary in a democratic society"". This right includes the freedom to hold opinions, and to receive and impart information and ideas, but allows restrictions for:

*     interests of national security
*     territorial integrity or public safety
*     prevention of disorder or crime
*     protection of health or morals
*     protection of the reputation or the rights of others
*     preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence
*     maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary

The issue of ""censorship"" comes from the potential for upload filters to falsely label perfectly legal uses such as referring to a clip from a TV show for the purposes of review or to for the purpose of remixing the source material into something trans-formative like parody. An upload filter (Which while not directly stated in the directive, would pretty much be the only feasible way to comply with the directive's demands) can't tell ""oh it does use copyrighted material, but it's ok because it's fair use"". Instead it only checks if upload X matches copyright Y and in the case of article 13, it could be blocked should the AI deem it ""infringing"".

&amp;#x200B;

3281,"Frâua, Frauendorf, Asszonyfalva (Women's village) took its name after being the queen's estate.

In 1950 it got renamed to Axente Sever, a Romanian leader of the 1848 events who was born in the village.

The troops led by Axente Sever among other things took part of the destruction of the villages of Abrudbánya (Abrud) and Nagyenyed (Aiud).

In Abrudbánya on 9 May 1849, after a short siege around 1000 ethnic Hungarians were massacred. On the 17th of May, at least 182 people got massacred from the previously escaped returning population.



In Nagyenyed the destruction was co-led by Romanian Orthodox priests of Muzsnaháza (Măgina).

The population did not believe that they would be hurt by the until then peaceful Romanians. On the day of the Orthodox Christmas, hell broke out at night. 800-1000 unprotected people were slaughtered locally, not sparing a baby, a woman, elder. Nearly the same number of people who had fled barefoot into the surrounding mountains froze to death. Maybe they could have stood a chance in the castle church, but the danger came unexpected. The men were away serving in the army of the Hungarian War of Independence, so it was not a fight, but an abominable massacre and robbery. 

The centuries-old spiritual values ​​of the College were done in the mud. The artifacts the villains appreciated more got carried out from the village by several chariots for themselves. Though the secret police of the royal court ordered them to turn them back.

Some of the dead were buried in the castle chain (the yard of today's kindergarten), and the other half was buried in the pit next to the castle walls, where the memorial plaque stands.

The plaque has nothing else but the date of the pogrom. Roman numbers indicate the year (to make it harder to realize it is tied with the 1848 events)

The creators of the terrible deaths were not punished, but sculptures still in existence today, and their name, incorporated in the name of their birthplace, proclaim their ""glorious actions.""

3312,"You get downvoted but this is it.

There has always been thugs and dangers. I don't dismiss that the MENA refugees comes with security issues because that's all they do.

On the otherhand, people from some country side village that has never seen so much a tanned person, see the news of a burning car and loses their minds. The whole thing is extremely exaggerated.

What we're experiencing is inequality and animosity caused by rightwing liberalism. I'll explain; 

housing market has been privatised. Only luxury housings being built. 

Refugee care have been privatised.
They get to live under minimum supervision, in shacks somewhere in no mans land. 400 refugees located in a village of 200.

Schools have been able to privatise. Meaning they're still bring paid by taxes but are allowed to make profit. They can also divert from the official teaching plans as long as the ""knowledge goal"" is achieved. This has also opened up for religious elementary schools.
The requirements for teachers dropped considerably as less people enter the profession.

The far right opposition voted through a conservative budget during recent election. Meaning that the unemployment office got their funds reduced to almost nothing. While the institution was an adult daycare and heap of shit in my opinion, they also helped fund the start of many immigrants careers.

On too of that, outside the liberal issues, Sweden isn't a resource heavy country. Low skilled labour isn't easy to find. We produce mostly intellectual products. You don't go from being an Afghani goat farmer to a Database technician at spotify.

Lastly, the liberalism that the article speaks of comes from several sources but the ruling party, The SocialDemocrats"", were the one to implement the border controls last term. This term, in order to combat the previous nazi party, ""SwedishDemocrats"", they had to team up with 3 other parties, all 3 further right than themselves. The greens, ""Miljöpartiet"", have always been a bad mix of communistic statelessness and socialliberal reforms. The Center and Liberal party have been classic liberals for a long timer. This party cooperation have forced the dominant left wing party to drop their restricted immigration policy for this term.

I foresee that this liberal transition will be the hardest challenge for Sweden as most of the declined caused in the last 20 years have been caused by privatisation and deregulation.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/an6pre/swedish_liberalism_is_struggling_under_the_weight/efsc6c5/,SlowBuddy,1549361081

3437,"The change of leadership of Rosstat continues to work wonders with the indicators of the Russian economy.


In the 6 weeks that have passed since Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev dismissed Alexander Surinov, who headed national statistics since 2009, and replaced him with ex-Minister of Economy of the Saratov Region Pavel Malkov, Rosstat managed to improve the growth estimate by almost a third.


Almost $ 10 billion of additional GDP Rosstat pulled out like a rabbit out of a hat, and on Monday reported on accelerating the economy to a rate that was not even in 2013 with oil more expensive than $ 100 per barrel.


Following the results of 2018, according to Rosstat, the Russian economy added 2.3%, setting a record since 2012 and exceeding the forecasts of even the chronically optimistic head of the Ministry of Economic Development, Maxim Oreshkin, who expected 2.1% at the beginning of the year and 1.8% in August .


Russian statistics managed to confound all professional forecasters - from global investment banks to the International Monetary Fund: for example, JP Morgan economists expected a 1.6% growth (September-2018), Economist Intelligence Unit - 1.7% (October-2018), IMF - 1 , 7%, the World Bank - only 1.5%. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation also expected no more than 2%, referring to the structural weakness of the economy, dependent on raw materials and stagnant without reforms.


Back in November, Rosstat statistics fit into this framework: for 11 months, GDP growth was estimated at 1.8%. But in January, when calculating the December data, Rosstat managed to find 0.5% of previously invisible GDP, or 518 billion rubles in monetary terms.
Construction data came under a large-scale revision: the growth at the level of error, which in January-November was 0.5%, had turned into a construction boom unprecedented for more than 10 years by the end of December.


Under the revision ""backdating"" all the construction work of the past year fell. According to its results, Rosstat counted the construction of a 5.3% growth.


Smooth shock hurried Ministry of Economic Development. In a special release published on January 28, the ministry urged that the construction not initially taken into account was carried out in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District; they were recorded by statistics as an investment, and only by the end of the year did they fall into the construction category due to “lags in the time of delivery and acceptance of work”. But the Rosstat Ministry of Economic Development disproved the hypothesis: out of a 2.3% growth, only 0.26 were provided by the builders. According to statistics, the main source of the economic miracle was Russian consumers.


Despite the fall in household incomes for the fifth year in a row, private consumption accounted for more than half of economic growth - 1.2%, and the Russians consumed mainly services. This sector gave almost 60% of the final success in GDP - 1.3%.
At the same time, neither retailers nor consumers themselves could see the consumer boom.


A survey of retailers conducted by the HSE Market Research Center in December showed that 55% of them complain of “insufficient demand”. Only 17% of retailers were able to increase sales, and 28% - reported their reduction. According to this indicator, the market approached the worst values ​​of the beginning of 2017 (15% vs. 30%) and almost repeated the “failure” of the crisis of 2015.


According to another HSE survey, only 9% of Russians stated an improvement in their financial situation over the past year. In 33% of the financial situation has worsened.


Only 12% of respondents were able to see the overall growth of the economy, while 46% said that the situation was getting worse.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/anc33i/rosstat_discovered_10_billion_of_invisible_gdp_a/efs8ibf/,Poultry22,1549354498

Also, Sweden is a society that won't say the things straight, everything is sugar-coated, therefore is expected for them to say that things are OK but go and vote for SD.

3534,"Perhaps a somewhat interesting take is that Finland used to be far less populated than Estonia as Finns were a smaller offshoot from the core Proto-Finnic peoples, who stayed south of the Gulf of Finland.

The Finnish Estonia-oriented historian Seppo Zetterberg puts the historical populations like that:

- 1200: Estonia 200k, Finland 60k

- 1550: Estonia 300k, Finland 300k

- 1620: Estonia 100k, Finland 330k

- 1695: Estonia 400k, Finland 500k

- 1720: Estonia 200k, Finland 350k

- 1750: Estonia 335k, Finland 427k

- 1800: Estonia 500k, Finland 833k

- 1860: Estonia 750k, Finland 1.75m

- 1881: Estonia 881k, Finland 2.00m

- 1900: Estonia 960k, Finland 2.65m

- 1920: Estonia 1.1m, Finland 3.14m

Finland is more to the north, so its nature has been historically even less forgiving than Estonia's, especially due to the rocky geology. But Finland got warmer in time, new technologies allowed more people to live off that land, and Estonia got into some nasty famines, wars and plagues, decimating much of the population.

The Southwestern Finnish dialects have historically been at more contact with Estonians as the Finnish southern coast wasn't that densely inhabited and the economic center was at Turku. And these local dialects seems to have been influenced by Estonian as they also abbreviate word endings, which is one of the main differences between Finnish and Estonian.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/anakzq/what_do_you_know_about_the_finnougric_peoples_of/efs3jo9/,k6lvatu,1549347309

The problems are mainly the ones caused by the globalized economy (states no longer have any control over capital and large corporations, instead being reduced to begging for companies to come and for them to pay taxes). But there are also demographic concerns. For a lot of countries a low birth rate has been partially compensated with immigration.

The Séléka and the anti-balaka engaged in a cycle of increasing violence.[12][13]

As many Christians had more settled lifestyles and many Muslims were nomadic, claims to the land were yet another dimension of the tensions.[14] In November 2013, the UN warned the country was at risk of spiraling into genocide,[15] was ""descending into complete chaos"".[16] France described the country as ""... on the verge of genocide"".[17] On 2 December 2013, anti-balaka militiamen are suspected to have killed 12 people, including children, and wounded 30 others in an attack on the mostly-Muslim Fula in Boali, according to the government.[18] This was amidst the Central African Republic conflict under the Djotodia administration.

Early 2014 marked a turning point; hardened by war and massacres, the anti-balaka committed multiple atrocities.[5] In December 2013, UNICEF reported that in sectarian violence in Bangui, at least two children were beheaded and one of them was mutilated.[19] In 2014, Amnesty International reported several massacres committed by anti-balaka against Muslim civilians, forcing thousands of Muslims to flee the country.[20]

The only people who had to suffer in Odessa were the Jews and that's a dark page in our history for sure, but we didn't butcher the local population as the Nazis did. Further more, it was Romanians who got deported to Siberia in fact after the war by the Soviets. Also, you seem to forget that tens of thousands of Romanians died on the Allies' side as well. If Germany or Italy were helped after the war, I'm sure Romania could've been to. It was not about sending millions of soldiers, we didn't have even the international support.

3701,"No, the Greeks developed the first alphabet considering they developed characters to represent vowels, the Middle Eastern version was a consonant only system thus not a true alphabet. Regardless, people in the [Sinai Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Sinaitic_script) developed this first ""alphabet"" as early as the 19th century BC, long before any mention of ""Phoenicians"" in the historical record. The Phoenicians basically took an already created, albeit slightly refined ""alphabet"" with them to Europe, a bit like how Arabs took the Hindu/Indian numeral system which is now called the ""Arab"" numeral system because Arabs were the people who introduced it to Europe.

The characters that made up this ""alphabet"" were all lifted from Egyptian Hieroglyphs anyway, or potentially from the Greek Linear systems which would have been introduced to the region via Mycenaean colonisers such as the Philistines.

These Oriental scoundrels were infanticidal and unscrupulous merchants, kidnappers, child enslavers, thieves and mass rapists. Ancient Greek writers and historians, the cornerstones of Western Civilisation thought such as Homer utterly despised these entirely alien people because of their depravity and lack of any humanity, compassion and dignity. 

Where are their Parthenons, the Temples to their gods, their marbles, the scientific, mathematical, political and philosphical creations and advancements such as those that were pioneered in Greece? Where is their architecture, their engineering, their medicine, their literature, their democracy? They left nothing, hardly any written works whatsoever (which is curious for a people of supposed writing), they haven't existed for thousands of years, they were annihilated in Carthage because of their savagery and destroyed by Alexander The Great for their nefarious and deceitful barbarity. Contrast to the Greeks and their civilisation that not only remain but are the bedrock of Western Civilistion.

To me when you explain that South Korea is prohibitively expensive it's actually quite funny. It's funny because as an Helsinki resident, it's just the opposite to me. To me South Korea is quite affordable.

Of course all of what this is, is purchasing power difference caused by productivity difference. This is one of the things which I mean when I asked that why doesn't society move forward at a faster rate.

Comparisons to more Western Russia doesn't change things. Rather it just begs the question of what are the issues there. I'd also wager you are making a comparison to cities that are extremely land-locked, one of the issues that likely has a lot to do with it, and not for example between Vladivostok and St Petersburg.

Regarding the location and distances I do understand that it possesses a real challenge that's not just going to go away. However, in regards to traveling which you discussed about, you said that one tends travel within Russia because of prices. That's not a location issue at all, it's a purchasing power issue. Location alone can't in fact be used to explain the downsides which you have brought up.

Small cities. You can go from Eastern Russia to U.S. or to Finland for that matter, and you will the very same pattern taking place. In modern world most of these places don't have much economic rationale for existing, at least to extent they do. Machinery made the portion of population required (required, not what it necessarily is) to run agriculture or primary production small. Aggregate benefits continue to accumulate in cities. This is why I don't think they are interesting at all. They have no importance to play. These underlying reasons are neither changing or short term trends, rather they are decades and centuries long trends. There's no end in sight to this. If anything the trends seem to be accelerating in past decade or so.

I don't think the larger cities are what they could be, but are rather immensely under performing compared to their potential. Whatever the exact potential is sort of massive unknown.

That's a nice piece of argumentation right there, one can only wonder what type of person uses that kind of language in a situation like this should I do the same? /s

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, it's not about what ""tends to work"" it's the conscious effort itself, for the same reason that it does not matter if slavery ""works"" (or if it could work) it's simply outlawed for reasons that transcend mere pragmatism now.

And here is where the ""traditional"" part comes in because it's about the ""good and evil"" aspect and how they would be defined traditionally, I'm not referring to tradition in terms of culture.

Even then, by itself it is still intellectually dishonest and hypocritical at its roots, because the assumptions are made that a ""good"" or ""just"" way exists, yet end up being contradicting or fail at actually understanding the hypocrisy of the position itself, hence giving birth to double standards.

&amp;#x200B;

The second you used ""healthy"" society, it simply revealed that a stance was being held, which was essentially confirmed by what you stated later by using ""unfortunately"" and ""better"".

From what you've written, it's pretty clear you're implying that having a so called ""in-group preference"" is a thing that, in your opinion, ""should"" be there. A divisive sentiment, that often leads to segregation as history can tell us, and perhaps, according to you it might not be ""right"" or maybe even ""wrong"" but that doesn't mean it can hold up to scrutiny either.",,/r/europe/comments/an5coa/dutch_former_antimuslim_politician_converts_to/efrrm7w/,Jalleia,1549335636

[Germany Can’t Manage Its Weapons](https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2014/10/11/germany_cant_manage_its_weapons_107488.html)

*Tanks, ships and planes are late, too costly—and half of them aren’t fit for service*

On Oct. 6, Defense Minister Ursula Von Der Leyen released a report by an outside consultancy analyzing the military’s nine biggest weapons purchases.

The report is damning. Every single procurement effort suffers some combination of cost overruns, delays and technical shortfalls. And owing to the ministry’s unwillingness or inability to negotiate proper contracts, the government has had to pay for the overruns itself. The arms manufacturers waltz away with their full fees.

Projects including the Puma fighting vehicle and the A400M transport plane are years late and billions of dollars more expensive than the government originally estimated. Shady contracting practices and the overly-politicized management of arms deals are largely to blame.

For the Puma purchase, the army applied a standard contract template—basically the same type of contract the military would use to buy napkins or uniforms. It included only a minimal penalty for cost overruns.

And instead of initiating a bidding contest between Germany’s two tank builders—Landsystem-Häuser Rheinmetall and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann—for political reasons the ministry gave the contract to a consortium of both companies. The absence of real competition is costing the army dearly.

In late September, the German military sent an explosive report to parliament, confessing that half of the armed forces’ heavy equipment is unserviceable and can’t deploy in a crisis.

The German navy, for example, possesses 15 Sea King helicopters, but 12 of them are grounded. The situation is similar with respect to the naval Sea Lynx helicopter—just four out of 18 can fly—and the heavy-lifting CH-53 helicopter. Sixteen out of 43 CH-53s are functional.

A further example of how the national operations of the NKVD were conducted. If some defect is actually preventing you from understanding the relevance of these quotes then I'm sorry, I overestimated you.

&gt;and sneakily trying to sell idea that Soviet political police were lying to themselves

We literally know that they shot people for nothing else but suspicion of being Polish and that they selected people by reviewing phone books and looking for Polish sounding names, but nice to hear your faith in your NKVD comrades is so strong. Right, they're known for their precise use of vocabulary and they would certainly never drop any blanket ""enemy of the people"" terms on the innocent people they're about to execute.

&gt;Well, since - as you say, Soviets were exterminting Polish people - after almost half a century of their rule we are thouroghly exterminated and do not exist.

You thought this was worth bolding.

&gt;false thesis about Soviet Union ""systematically exterminating Polish people""

""The following categories of people were arrested by the NKVD during its Polish operation, as described in Soviet documents:

*""Active"" members of the Polish minority in Soviet Union (practically all Poles).[3][4]
*All immigrants from Poland.
*Political refugees from Poland (mostly members of the Communist Party of Poland).
*Former and present members of the Polish Socialist Party and other non-communist Polish political parties.
*All prisoners of war from the Polish-Soviet war remaining in the Soviet Union.
*Members of Polska Organizacja Wojskowa listed in the special list (most of them were not members of that organisation).""

Interestingly, the first, most damning item on this list is based on a part of the book ""The specter of genocide: mass murder in historical perspective"" by supposedly ""one of the leading historians of modern Europe, particularly during World War II and the Cold War era"".

3929,"Yet for some reason you attacked me while I was trying to prove my point using valid arguments. Firstly, it is true that Gibraltar was ceded before the formation of a central modern Spanish state, but that doesn't mean it didn't exist before that. Spain was a thing since the reign of Charles I in 1512, and regardless of any form of state, the people living in the decentralized Spain were the same that lived in the centralized Spain, what changed were institutions, nor the people or their country. Gibraltar wasn't considered a worthless rock, and it had its own castle and a Spanish population, which pretty not worthless to me, or if you consider that worthless you could consider the Channel Islands worthless too. But after having a civil war and lost of it's European possessions, I don't think it was in the interest of Spain to fight a large war for only Gibraltar.

The British Did expell the Spanish Gibraltarians, who had to found a new home, not far from Gibraltar, called Algeciras.

It is true that not all of Gibraltarians are British, but most of them are British descendants, or not Spanish, and very little Spanish people live in Gibraltar, and I can assure you that they are not from Algeciras or the area around Gibraltar.

La Linea is a town of Spanish people who have to work in Gibraltar because in the Spanish area around of Gibraltar, there is no work, and it has been impoverished by Gibraltar, which is a tax haven.

Yet Americans colonized their country and expelled or killed the natives that were on the land they settled.

3938,"I'll reply backwards.

&gt;&gt; All genocides follow the same pattern and they all boil down to the same simple elements.

&gt; No. Simply, that's not factual. Not every genocide follows some pattern of, ""oh we are going to kill them all, but let's wait until some big event that we can do it, evil laugh"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_stages_of_genocide

Obviously my point wasn't that there is a prepared plan before the execution phase of a genocide. But the sociological aspect of it where the ""enemy within us"" needs to be eradicated ""or else!"". Independently of the reason for why a specific people are painted as the enemy. Again, the the reasons is completely irrelevant to the dynamics in place which cause a genocide or similar atrocities to take place. The pattern is always the same. Sometimes in the the case of narrations of the Armenian Genocide the focus is placed on the stated reasons and not on the underlying reasons for the atrocity. 

There is no such thing as a genocide or a similar mass atrocity out of the blue occurring in one single day without the stage being set already. This doesn't mean the set stage has to be necessarily pre-planned. Although it is in most of the cases.

&gt; The Armenian issue came into the point of their organisations demanding authonomy no matter what, their organisations having arms and Russian Empire being just around the region. Therefore, they find the solution via death marching them and eliminating them.

There is no plausible explanation such as the one you are providing to order the deporting of the majority of the civilians who again were not able bodied men. By the time of the deportations most of the settlements were only left with women and children. It is a pretext narrative which is still lingering over a century even in our modern day and age and many people keep on propagating. Just like how going about the Jews being dangerous because of their economic power in Germany is a bankrupt narrative. The underlying reason is that it is determined that &lt;Group X&gt; is incompatible with society - independently of the stated reasons. In the case of the Armenians it had to do with the ideology of the three pashas and their plan for their understanding of the new empire, if the equation of giving them their lands to go away is of course not on the table. 

&gt;&gt; The political motives behind genocides almost always boils down to social heterogeneity as well - however this is qualified on a case per case basis.

&gt; Eh, no. That doesn't have to be the reason. There has been genocides that haven't been based on such things.

I am not talking about the stated reasons. But the underlying sociological and ideological motivations. Politics are the driving reasons, but the deeper ideological and sociological urges which are what really cause genocides and mass atrocities are what are left in the dark specially with regards to cases such as the Armenian one. Acts which commit these crimes are acting by conviction in what they do - understand that thousands upon thousands of people do not go around killing ""the other"" for political motives. But ideological and sociological urges. Hence the scapegoating / blaming, discrimination and dehumanisation. The ideological and sociological factors are what are weaponised by the main perpetrators against the targeted group. Most of the time these ideological and sociological elements linger on far after the atrocities are over. This is the case in most of the genocides of the 20th century with a somewhat exceptional case of the Holocaust where even though the perpetrator state ""fixed"" itself and its populace, the underlying ideologies and sociological elements linger on in other parts of the world with respect to the Jews. For example these issues are brought to the spotlight in the Holocaust as being the underlying reasons - anti-Semtism in this case. Yet for example in the case of Armenians, the contrary is basically state policy in some places. This is why narration of how things occur without addressing the deeper reasons, namely ideological and sociological - which are the crucial elements which make genocides and mass atrocities happen (and not only political motives as you may believe) not providing an objective account of history. You know that with respect to the Armenians, there is a lot of hate speech and denial of the genocide, and no the default position by many is not that *Armenians* were innocent, instead  that this is a fundamental policy pushed by certain states, so one shouldn't be surprised if the issue is brought to attention. 

Also Armenians were the predominant Christian group left in the empire after the Balkans. ",,/r/europe/comments/am1v61/ethnicities_of_ottoman_parliament_deputies_in_1908/efr61i1/,Idontknowmuch,1549318226

Because it wasn't thousands of years ago but in the middle ages and throughout into the modern era. Bosnian Kings ruled Croatia and Serbia and were Serbs. 

Bosniaks today refute their Serbian heritage and make false history to justify their existence as an ethnic group.

This has many factors to it, from the failed assimilation of Muslims back into their Serbian roots because of the Orthodox church and the vilification of Muslims during the period of occupation. And especially under Titoist Yugoslavia were ethnicities such as Bosniak, Montenegrin and Macedonian were solidified.

Bosniaks shouldn't let go of their customs and new found traditions but denying history and making it up is ultimately bad.

No we did not. The ""spanish"" kicked out the other ""spanish""... again, go read the wiki page (or maybe you think the wiki page was written by Brits or something) it states it quite clearly that you kicked your own people out... not us. 

&gt;It is true that not all of Gibraltarians are British, but most of them are British descendants, or not Spanish, and very little Spanish people live in Gibraltar, and I can assure you that they are not from Algeciras or the area around Gibraltar.

I have several Spanish friends who are happy working in Gib, they're happy working there and getting a good wage that they claim by their own account they wouldn't get in their own country in Spain. 

&gt;La Linea is a town of Spanish people who have to work in Gibraltar because in the Spanish area around of Gibraltar, there is no work, and it has been impoverished by Gibraltar, which is a tax haven.

We have provided HUNDREDS of jobs to Spanish people. You are in denial. La linea exists because of Gibraltar. The people smuggling the cigs etc... what nationality do you think these people are ?

That is because there is none. Remember, apologists will always say it is ""good in theory"" or ""good on paper"". They confuse good theory for internal consistency. Communism was based internally consistent logic, but completely false presupposition. Marx and those like him got it  wrong right from their presuppositions. It is a good thing that the distribution of wealth follows the same curve as the utility of knowledge and intelligence, an exponential one. Everyone is better off in such a distribution when large amounts of capital are managed by the most experienced and intelligent.

He is protected from justice by the current political party in power and the mafia oligarch Plahotniuc. The justice is completely politically controled. So his case is constantly postponed and reassigned to some other country in another corner of the state. He is the mayor of Orhei, a small town in R. Moldova, where he is seen as a great hope because he invested money into roads and social stores. Almost nobody there cares if he stole huge amounts of money. Important for them is to also get something out of it. This guy is also promoted in the media empire controled by mr. Plahotniuc (3-4 tv channels and several newspapers and sites). It's clear that Plahotniuc wants his Șor Party in the parliament after the elections from 24 February. All the realtives of his russian wife are now trying to benefit from a new law that allows you to buy moldovan citizenship if you have a 100.000-200.000 dollars to spare. You can even come forward and admit you stole huge amounts of money from the state and only pay back 3% of what you have stolen and youțll be forgiven for your crime. R. Moldova, unfortunately, is a mafia state.

&amp;#x200B;

I see you used some polls from there that claim only 3 parties will enter the Parliament. Fact is, pretty much all the polls are highly unrealiable. They always show the figures ordered by the political party paying for the poll.   


The pro-russian ''socialist'' party (actually communist in disguise) of mr. Igor Dodon is indeed seen as the best placed in these elections. Why? Well, several reasons. It sells stories about entering the new USSR (Eurasian Economic Union), which will bring honey and milk pouring on the streets, which is very appealing to both the USSR nostalgics (usually elderly people that are very active in elections) and to the russophone minority (around 25-30% of the population). It lies to the population that Russia is the main commercial partener and the only way for the economy to grow (actually, according to the official statistics, Romania is the main commercial partener, buying 3 times more products than Russia). It tells them that the pro-western politicians that claim to want in the EU are all thieves and traitors, the EU is evil and will invade the state with muslims and gays, etc. This rhetoric, backed up by the intense russian propaganda spread through the russian tv channels (80% of the media in R. Moldova) and the russian church, is very effective. It also tells them that the people do not have to make sacrifices to enter the EU. They can simply enter in the EEU and get even more benefits. It implies the west (EU and NATO) wants war, to destroy the sovereignity and independence, etc. and he is the only person that can protect the state (actually he went to the separatist region of Transnistria to commemorate the russians and separatists) that died in the 1990's and says R. Moldova was to blame for the war, he went to autonomous Gagauzia where he was decorated for supporting more autonomy or even the idea of creating a new state inside R. Moldova and went to Moscow for 100 times in 2 years to promise he will ''transnistrize'' R. Moldova according to a russian plan. He clearly works against everything he claims to protect). He rides the soviet theories of ''moldovenism'' (the existence of a ''moldovan'' language different than Romanian language and a ''moldovan'' ethnicity different than the Romanian ethnicity, that were always ''liberated'' and ''protected'' by big brother Russia) that proved to be pretty effective in R. Moldova and constantly feeds the population with scaremongering stories about the europeans/romanians wanting to invade the state, destroy it, start a civil war, etc. and he and only he can defend the state against the evil ''euro-unionists'' (a term he coined to give a name to the subject of his scaremongering propaganda) and his great relationship with Putin will bring Russia's protection. (actually, the russians are starting to make fun of him even on the tv channels that are seen in R. Moldova).

&amp;#x200B;

The ACUM (NOW) coalition consists of 2 new parties (PAS and PPDA). They are genuine pro-EU, although they tend to mislead people on how close R. Moldova is from entering the EU. I read somewhere that they claim R. Moldova will officially start negotiations in 2023, which is highly unlikely to happen out of multiple reasons. PAS is a party comprising 2 very different views (moldovenist statalists and unionists). Maia Sandu, it's leader, publicly admited that she considers herself Romanian ethnic and even has the romanian citizenship, she would vote for unification if such a referendum would ever take place, but she thinks for now trying to enter the EU and working on the internal issues is more important. The 2 views in this party can so far be kept under control by the fact the road to either joining the EU and reunifying with Romania is pretty similar (various reforms need to be implemented, strengthen various institutions, improve the economy, etc). Besides, an eventual unification with Romania would also lead to joining the EU. PPDA is a pro-EU moldovenist party, lead by mr. Andrei Năstase, with a smaller fan base than PAS. Its leader won the elections in Chișinău but the election results were annulled by the PDM/Plahotniuc controled justice. He is a bit more fishy than Maia Sandu and tends to change his speech according to his audience (for example he is romanian ethnic and unionist in Romania, he is statalist in R. Moldova or Russia).  This coalition is seen as second favourite in these elections with 20-25%.

&amp;#x200B;

The Democrat Party (PDM) of mr. Plahotniuc is the party in power. In last elections it only came 4th but after it bought many parliament members mainly from the Communist Party, it artificially got the majority in the parliament and got to power. It is a fake pro-EU party that has frozen any reforms need to keep R. Moldova on the EU path and was more involved in solving mr. Plahotniuc interests. It controls the state institutions with an iron fist, it throws to jail political oponents, it protects political allies from justice, it uses the public funds and foreign aid for populist measures that could keep them in power. They also threaten mayors and anyone not bending the knee. They took a big dump on the law in R. Moldova and legalized the mafia state. They are expected to take a new loan from China for new desperate populist measures, although the state already borrowed more money than its entire GDP.  A big help for this party is mr. Plahotniuc's media empire. It should be noted that while PDM constantly attacked ACUM, it never attacked the ''socialists'' of mr. Dodon. On the contrary, they worked together several times in the parliament and even negotiated key positions in various state companies and institutions. Which makes many believe these 2 parties had a hidden collaboration in the past 2 years that may become official after 24 february. A socialist-democrat government may impose in the parliament the russian plan for the ''transnistrization'' of R. Moldova. The fact PDM toned down its usual fake pro-EU messages and turned to more statalist messages in this campaign  (PDM for Moldova) and some anti-unionist messages, basically mimicking the ''socialist'' party, could be another hint in this direction.

But what's even funnier is how apparent that you do not give a shit about the victims at all. Their suffering is of use to you to moan about the oppression of White people. You hate Muslims, you hate gypsies, you hate trans people. And I would bet some good money that you hate your own life, too.

Romani will never go back to India. 

The only way we would leave Europe would be if we had our own nation-state homeland where we make up the majority.
Like Israel.

The very least we would want to be the majority in a state in a first world country, like how the Mormons make up the majority of Utah.

What ""argument""? Give me proof that the EU is in fact undemocratic.



&gt;Yeah so it is smart to add a second layer of corruption on top of the already existing corruption. Especially when you're talking about something the public has no control over.

Corruption doesn't have to stack up. And the public has control over the EU, just in a more indirect way.


&gt;The EU's negotiating comes down to ""we're going to allow you to leave (how gracious of us) but you're going to be our puppet"".

And that is simply not true. It is in fact utterly bullshit. The EU just don't want to compromise on its core principles. Play shitty games, win shitty prices. Every smart human being knew that leaving the EU would be very costly for the UK. It is exactly like in real life. If you leave a club you don't have to pay the fee, but you also lose every privilege in the club. The whole price of Brexit is losing privileges. And that shows how utterly stupid Brexit is, because all these privileges are just soo good.


&gt;The EU has no opposition party, the people have no influence in it's policies. Just do some googling into Juncker and Selmayr.

Again this is utterly bullshit. There are many institutions in the EU. For example the members of the European Parliament are elected by the people. And in the case of the European Commision it's members get nominated by nations governments, and on top of that they have to be accepted by the EP. So there you have also influence.

4163,"&gt; Armenians as *a people* were blamed from the Balkans all the way to Enver's failings and all the way for the political aspirations of some of the organisations seeking more equal rights or autonomy and everything in-between for being tools of the Entente to being Christians, to having concentrated economic and business power, ... you name it. The question to ask is what were they not blamed for!

They weren't blamed for Enver's failings or Balkans. Where do you get such ideas? Them wanting authonomy seen as route to independence/secession just like same seen when Bulgarians demanded it. Why? Since Greece, Crete and such. The trauma of Balkans of course ended up with seeing Armenians' demands seen as the worst, yet scapegoating is something that is pretty different than that.

&gt; I think as this conversation advances it becomes apparent that you either have no grasp of the fallacy in a people being blamed for anything or you agree with blame being placed on a people, and frankly I don't know what is worse.

Armenians were blamed as whole, for secessionism and collaboration. But scapegoating is a whole different concept. I think that's where we do differ. I can't see how Armenians are being blamed for Balkan Wars or Enver's operations.

&gt; Yet your narrative suggests that they were a dangerous group without one single iota of even an implicit expression that such a point of view is the issue and not the people who were killed.

I don't suggest such a thing. If that's your impressions, then you are misunderstanding/misreading me.

&gt; I repeat, if you did this exact thing you are doing in holocaust related threads you would be singled out as an anti-semite. Put your shoe in the other place and picture the situation and think about why is this the case.

I think no-one would assume me an anti-Semite for giving out reasons and narratives of Nazis. Especially when I say I don't agree with them, and don't see things like that. Again, I do think blaming whole nation was a mistake and a crime, them being blamed for asking authonomy or even independence was also not righteous since it was their right, and sure I won't be siding with empire against people living in their ancestral lands. Collective punishment was also wrong, let alone cleansing and mass massacres which ended up with partial destruction of them during a death march.

Mate, specifically speaking, my forefathers and their ethnic group were cleansed and expelled from our ancestral lands by Russian Empire, yet I don't think anyone should come up with a narratibe speaking they have done it just because we were XYZ, since it wasn't the case there either. Were we righteous and the victim? Sure. Same goes for Armenians, but still.

&gt; Of *your* narrative. Not mine or that of many others who see that categorising a whole people as enemies is never justified, even hinted at, and that it should never be brought up as a reason for their destruction, unless at the very least it is strongly implied that such reasoning is wrong and the perpetrators were wrong to reason like that. Yet you do not do such thing.

I don't say they were right to do so. I'm saying they have categorised them as such.

&gt; And here you go again. What is the difference between all the innocents killed in all these cases apart from their membership to their ethnic/national/religious groups?

Backgrounds, reasons, etc. Same or similar crimes being committed doesn't mean they had the same reasons or whatever.

&gt; How is that false? So the others were killed because of what? For not being Muslims, even Muslim Armenians? The elderly, women and children for requesting autonomy? Are you aware of the fallacy you are repeating all the time? A neo Nazi would say that Jews were killed for being impure, and for conspiring against Germany with their banking power and whatever it is that they say today. You are saying the exact same thing with respect to Armenians. Both peoples were killed for the mere fact of being declared dangerous and worthless. Only in one case you are putting emphasis on such declaration without even disclaiming that such declaration is what is wrong to begin with and yet on the other case you are putting emphasis on the fact that civilians had nothing to do with why they were killed - which would be the correct narration.

Again, I think I've openly said I don't agree with that narrative two comments ago... You're assuming weird things here.

Jews have been killed since Nazis believing them being lower race and dangerous to anyone. Armenians have been cleansed for not to see a secession and eliminating what then authority seen as a dangerous group to the empire. Both being wrongdoings doesn't mean they're the same when it comes to reasons. Jews were the scapegoats, while Armenians were collectively blamed and punished. You can argue that it was the paranoia, which you'd be righteous since there was the paranoia but scapegoating is, again, a different concept.

&gt; When you describe the pretexts and reasons for committing a genocide without even implicitly saying that such pretexts and reasons are wrong on a case such has the Armenian one with rampant genocide denial all over the place you are no different than a holocaust denier had the subject been about the holocaust.

US doesnt have a lot of oil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Oil_Reserves_by_Region.PNG

And as oil is the world’s largest traded commodity by far, US created wars all across Middle East and Northern Africa so they could exploit oil for really low price and sell it to their allies Saudi Arabia. Now when they used everything from those territories, they are moving where? Only region on chart above that has oil, Venezuela.

If you are denying that you are stealing oil from countries in Middle East and Northern Africa you are delusional and I dont have anything else to discuss with you.

Churchill as well Patton wanted to start another war that would result in even more casualties than the previous war, I don't understand how can you defend that. Every sane person ignored Churchill after that.

&gt;You tell untruth. ""What could they do against Stalin?"" - hmm let the countries of Eastern Europe rule without occupation (soviet)?

It would be the right thing to do, but Stalin wouldn't agree on such terms and the west didn't want to risk another war with the Soviets.

&gt; In Poland, Nazi guards were expelled from the camps and replaced with Soviet ones. I have heard many times that such atrocities as NKVD, KGB were worst then nasizm.

Yeah not true. Please tell me how many Poles were killed by the Soviets, I can tell you that 6 million were killed by the Germans. You lost 3 million just in concentration camps. If the Nazis won there would be no Poles today.

Please find me where I said we need more farmers? Of course we do, but for that free market needs to work. People need to be allow to be economically active without bribing people. No local industry will ever reliably prospers in a country as corrupt as Slovakia.
Also, local produce is not 2.5 times more expensive, in most cases its a difference of 30% or less. 



&gt;You are comparing apples to oranges. I have no idea where you find out protecting small businesses is a desirable thing to do but whatever. They are not forcing corportations to pay taxes. They could do it any day they would want but they dont. Retaliation would be ruthless and it would leave europe bleeding. It is pure populism and incompetency really.

Except they are working on making them pay their share on their profits here. Making sure that all companies abide the laws of your country is very desirable thing to do, but whatever.

The trains however are surprisingly ""fast"", I have to admit that.  
I GPS-ed them a couple of times and most speeds varied from 96 to 116 km/h. However they stop all too frequent and are slow to accelerate, which results in an average speed of around 62 km/h from Osijek to Zagreb.  


About that feedback loop, I have been making that point for so much time now and I am so happy too see someone agree.   


HŽ just can't understand that people have no incentive to travel 270 km at snail's pace only to have a terrible timetable imposed on them.  


If you have to go to Zagreb and be back the same day you have to be on the train at 5:27, arrive in Zagreb at 9:53 only to get back on the train at 16:38 and arrive home in Osijek at 21:21. That's an astonishing 9 hour and 9 mine train ride for 5 hours and 45 minutes spend in the city.  


This scenario might seem silly to some, but there are a lot of people who have to go to Zagreb for specialist checkups, business meetings and so on only to be back home the same day and at work the next.   


I bet you that if they could get the travel time from Osijek to Zagreb in around or less than 2 hours there would be a lot more people using the train, but as long as the highway is faster alternative people are going to disregard the additional 15€ because they are usually time constrained.

However, I would disagree that my view of this issues is distorted, at least in regards to Corsica. Aside from the stuff I’ve read or heard about this place, I’ve actually been there for about two weeks too - and the vibe I got from the locals there was an extreme sense of regional, even proto-national identity (and as somebody from the Balkans, I think I know how to spot these when I see them). They take their language, symbols and history quite seriously, and unlike most other regionalists in your country they use various methods to disassociate themselves from the common French identity (these methods include vandalism, such as the destruction of bilingual road signs in homogenous Corsican communities). Not that there’s anything wrong with Corsicans, I really like them as people (and their island is beautiful), but I have a sense that a lot of them would prefer to have the option to identify as non-French (as long as they respect the common French state, of course).",,/r/europe/comments/aky1dx/against_the_militancy_of_the_french_decolonial/efpt7d9/,Rakijosrkatelj,1549275069

4571,"One thing that is missing from your otherwise very well written post is employment. Sure, these companies are international, and thus most of the profit will leave the country, but employment is incredibly important for a healthy economy, and it helps kickstart the needed capital to produce regional champions of your own.

Which brings me to my other point: No developed country today is a master of all domains. Large countries of course have a variety of local and global champions, but some of their industries are still dominated by foreign companies.

Take Germany as an example: While we do have quite a few global champions (Cars, Pharmaceuticals, Fish Food etc.) and regional champions (discounters, steel, machine machines etc.), other markets are dominated by foreign companies, like Fashion, fast food chains, furniture etc.

Now building these regional and global champions is one of the most important tasks for citizens in developing countries. A good example for success is Estonia. Having a very business friendly, transparent and corruption-less state, they managed to attract a lot of international attention in the field of IT, and will probably develop into a quite significant hub in this regard in the next decade. This is anecdotal, but I'm working in the industry, and Estonia is one of the favorite targets to outsource to, because the population speaks very good English, the society is very stable, and they hold their contracts.

I've not yet visited a country where I wasn't impressed with a particular aspect of their society. I've worked with poles in construction, and it was simply amazing what they were able to do. An electrician, huge guy, restored stucco by hand, and better than any german professional. But instead of being ""rented"" out to other countries by a trustworthy, well-organized company in Poland, they usually emigrate and work as sub-contractors for local companies. (Where they also earn less than what they deserve.)

When I visited Bucharest, I was a bit surprised by the vibrant culture going on. If the government seizes on this opportunity, I think Bucharest will become the next capitol of hipsterism, penniless artists, and american expats in Europe. Romania in general is an amazing tourist destination, and it also has a lot of advantages for people working in IT.

Of course your points are valid, but these are consequences of globalism that are impossible to prevent, and globalism is still generating more distributed wealth than a protectionist economy of a small country could. Instead of trying to revert this process, we should do our best to channel it in a direction that benefits everyone the most.",,/r/europe/comments/amppdv/net_cashflow_per_capita_from_eu_funds/efpta4v/,antow92,1549275216

Honest question - have you looked for these studies yourself? AFAIK there is no such meta-study, as all the things you mentioned are studies in-by-themselves requiring extensive work. 

Eurostat has articles about this, as an example: [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3888793/8979317/KS-TC-18-003-EN-N.pdf/3a6c9295-5e66-4b79-b009-ea1604770676](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3888793/8979317/KS-TC-18-003-EN-N.pdf/3a6c9295-5e66-4b79-b009-ea1604770676)

And here: [https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/8718272/3-07032018-BP-EN.pdf/fb402341-e7fd-42b8-a7cc-4e33587d79aa](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/8718272/3-07032018-BP-EN.pdf/fb402341-e7fd-42b8-a7cc-4e33587d79aa)

&amp;#x200B;

However there are two aspects to look at: the gender pay gap on average (i.e. which looks at the overall picture, which is skewed by women working is lower paying sectors and avoiding shit like IT) and the gender pay gap per hour (sorry, my own terms, I have not studied all of these questions as much as I probably should have already), which would include the situation you said, however, again - you listed such a specific case (i.e. with two people being completely the same) which is practically impossible to actually do as a social researcher. 

Example from the second link:

&gt; The ‘unexplained’ gender pay gap is also likely to include discrimination in hiring, career progression and opportunities in the labour market36. For instance, a recent survey conducted in Ireland demonstrated that women are almost twice as likely as men to experience discrimination at work, in terms of pay and promotion37. 

Would you count these aspects as meaningful? I'm guessing not.

I mean, a simple example to state is that women are less willing to negotiate for their salaries - which is a reality - which exacerbates the gender pay gap - and which creates a policy question - how do we deal with more talented workers being paid less than their more socially capable peers? How do we deal with hiring discrimination which creates on average issues with women not getting the good jobs? How do we deal with women not wanting to go into spheres like IT because of, including, social aspects (i.e. it's not a womans job that stems from gender roles). How do we encourage more men to take paternity leave (and how do we equalize the roles between genders when it comes to raising kids so that the influence of having a child is less deadly for employability of the woman).",Damn dirty sexy Balts..,/r/europe/comments/amtph3/openly_gay_polish_politican_launches_progressive/efptef2/,LatvianLion,1549275441

Why? The question isn't particularly unusual.

&gt;I think when it comes to the eurozone, there's enough evidence in my mind at least to say that prosperity has come because of the eurozone.

In which case you might want to collate that evidence rather than putting together a poll of 85 people, because it'll almost certainly be more valuable. This poll basically tells us nothing at all, doubly so in the absence of any more information about the polling methodology or cohort. 

&gt;At the same time, depending on which time period we are discussing, maybe it could have been better to have separate currencies. The strong euro and a cluster of weak economies within the zone led to substantial economic problems across the space. Easily, one could argue both sides.

You can absolutely argue both sides, there are benefits and costs to EU membership and given the 2008 crisis you can pretty much be certain that the impact will have been major. I doubt anyone would argue with you that this is a question with two answers that can likely be defended, but a poll of 85 people seems a bit pointless.

The fortress is dated back to the 13-14 century, the name is of Turkish origin Yeni-Sala. More info here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarichioi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarichioi). The photo is taken last summer. I did a bivouac there. And the view was mesmerising as the fortress is on a hill which is surrounded on both sides by a lake. So the sunset and sunrise were really something.

They used lies to get the electorate to vote a certain way. This is not a coup with guns, but a democratic coup. They pushed their agenda through despite the wishes of entire countries and half of the UK as a whole.

If it is not a coup, it is a subversion of the democratic process, perhaps done with the assistance of the Russians, Bannon and others.

4711,"&gt; Missed the point which was that *even* the new denialist narratives are incorporating the anti-Christian sentiments form the Balkans into the narrative of why the genocide was carried out. It was to drive the point home, not say that they are the same. I mean scapegoating Armenians is even alive today in Turkey, having its roots to the genocide. It is something as clear as day.

Mate, anti-Christian views and scapegoating aren't the same things. Armenians weren't blamed for faults of others, and others wrongdoings weren't put upon them.

&gt; Oh, so all the civilians were killed because of what exactly? Because ""they were enemies of the state, or held political aspirations"", everybody including all the women and children and newborns? Seriously?

You're talking like if I was the one did it or if I'm justifying it... They were tried to get eliminated as the dangerous group, and faced a collective punishment.

&gt; The reason for *why* a whole people is categorised to be enemies is utterly irrelevant.

What? That's pretty much what our discussion is about. You are claiming they were eliminated for the sake of homogenous population, Turkification suddenly appearing one and a half decade ago it actually appears, modern nation building that even haven't started, and I'm saying it wasn't the reason behind the act.

&gt; You are completely wrong on what you wrote, the Jewish people were killed for the mere act of being Jewish, same with Armenians, Circassians, Tatars, &lt;Group X&gt;, what have you

Jews, yes. For the rest, Armenians have been killed because they have been seen as dangerous to the empire since they might and some already had demanded authonomy and a way to independence, and had organisations, etc., Circassians have been killed since they have resisted to Russian Empire and hadn't let Russia to take over Circassia for more than a hundred years, Tatars were killed since they went to way of depending independence and some have revolted and seen as dangerous which is like Armenians, etc. If you're talking about collective punishment and everyone being lumped and crime being committed on the basis of being from an ethnic/national group, sure. But saying these were committed just like Jews on the mere no reason other than being Jews, than it's false.

&gt; Looks like you are oblivious that the standards *are* low with respect to the Armenian Genocide? It is sadly the default position of many people as you know very well. A default position energetically propelled by a strong state with the backing of other strong states. You will not tend to see descriptions of Holocaust without the ideology behind it being at the very least implicitly if not explicitly singled out to be the root cause and yet many people do the exact opposite when describing the Armenian Genocide.

Mate, like do you want me to declare my distaste about imperial policies and ideology, or anti-x sentiments? I mean I can, yet seriously, I doubt if there is a need. I doubt if anyone really needs to say how they dislike anti-Semitism or Nazism every time they speak about Holocaust, or anti-Caucasian sentiments, imperial policies, colonialism when it comes to Circassian genocide, or anti-Native American sentiments, colonialism, expansionism, American exceptionalism etc. when it comes to natives, imperialism when it comes to Guatemala, etc. You got the point.

4740,"Most games have a heavy military presence, consider the Department of Defense pays for it all with tax payer money. 

&gt; “Department of Defense was paying the NFL for patriotic displays at the taxpayers’ expense. This was surprising to many people who figured the NFL was probably more than happy to eat the costs to honor veterans, find tickets for soldiers, and host flyovers before games.”

https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/amount-money-military-gives-nfl.html/

It’s all relatively recent. The government is trying to foster support for the troops (and by extension the whole government) amid its unpopular war campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

They pay for flyovers, for the national guard to come along, they pay for soldiers tickets who sit in the stands in uniform. It’s nice that the soldiers get to go, but don’t think it’s not without some propagandistic maneuver in mind. They sit in uniform with their families, and then they get put on the Jumbotron and everyone claps and suddenly the war in Iraq is okay because we need to support the troops no matter what. It’s about stoking patriotism to justify an unjust war and to recruit naive, impressionable young men and women to fight in that war. 

They do the same with baseball games. The DoD pays movies, video games TV shows to paint the troops and the military in a good light to get those new recruits. But besides getting people to enlist, it creates a fanatic devotion in certain members of society who see the idealized version of the military and think it can never be questioned or do any wrongs. So anytime anyone critiques the military, these fanatics jump at them.

&gt;	Purchasing oil and gas from a country that then uses those funds to develop, finance and deploy weapons meant to kill you is exactly the opposite of a security interest. It’s gross stupidity.

This argument can be made for any country that makes weapons. They’re afterall made to kill other countries. Allies today, enemies tomorrow.

&gt;	I don't use exclamation points. But, the narrative that the USA displays behavior that is more egregious than any other country is a tired old trope.

Pretending that the USA is a benevolent guardian of the free world is just as equally worn out old trope. I’m not saying the USA is worse, I’m saying the USA is no better than the rest.

&gt;	Countries are not moral, but act in their national interest. When these same countries act against the interest of the world, then it is up to that same community to punish that behavior, so it isn’t repeated.

This is how it should be, but this is not an ideal world and i dont see any change anywhere. 30 odd years since the first gulf war, I still don’t see the US troops being fully retreated.

&gt;	Say, like Russia currently occupying Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Or, like Russia’s current election interference in France, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Italy, Montenegro, the USA, the UK, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, the Baltics and the Balkans.

Because Trumps America first policy is so very ally oriented, right? Is it the same ally who [threatens sanctions to others](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/13/us-sanctions-european-countries-iran-deal-donald-trump) after the USA does a complete 180 on the deal? Allies today, enemies tomorrow.

Or ahould we forget the past 30 years of the USA doing the exact same thing in the middle east?

&gt;	The USA in no way poses the threat that Russia does to Europe. To make that case is ridiculous, laughable. Europe should choose its allies wisely and it ignores threats at its own risk.

Having military bases in every single European country somehow doesn’t pose a risk? One could argue it also serves as a insurance policy as well, not just power projection towards the east with the added benefit of helping the allies. Do you really think The NATO exist only out of pure benevolence? You’d be ignorant to think otherwise and you’ve said it yourself - every country acts in accordance to its own best interest.

&gt;	The Russians are at Europe’s doorstep, not the American’s. The battles will be fought there.

Which is why it would perhaps be beneficial to have more allied relations with Russia. I don’t understand this “us vs them” mentality. They are our neighbours after all, would it not be wise to have them on friendly relations? Why does Europe have to choose between the US and Russia? Why can’t it have good relations with both?

Leavers would feel betrayed by a soft-Brexit and remainers would think it’s pointless (basically all we would be doing is giving up our seat at the table), while no-deal Brexit needs no explanation, so I think to be pragmatic, the only option is option A, which would honour the referendum result and the Good Friday Agreement, and doesn’t take our economy off the proverbial cliff edge. But the only way the government can deliver that is with a majority and not be beholden to the DUP, so we need another general election and hope that either the Tories or Labour get a majority. 

However both party’s seem to be polling neck and neck, so we would either be stuck in the same predicament, or Labour would win and form a coalition with the Scottish nationalists who want another referendum on Scottish independence, which means we could see two countries possibly leaving the UK, and that would leave just England and Wales, at which point you might as well disband the union.

So, I guess there’s no painless way out of this, and it’s really a choice between which we’re most prepared to sacrifice: our union (A), our economy (B), or potentially our democracy (C - millions of disaffected voters who would feel angry and betrayed by Westminster could turn to hard-right populists like UKIP, just as they did in the 2014 European elections where they turned almost the entire country purple, and could deliver a hard Brexit anyway),",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/amr74j/mays_brexit_trilemma/efpedp6/,PTRJK,1549254233

The main problem for the UK right now is that there isn't really a big bargening chip the UK has for the EU to play into their hands. Well, they kinda have with all the departments, politicians the UK has and the significant amount the UK pays to the EU each year. But they ruined it with the referendum.

What the Leave side and/or government should've done is make a deal with the EU and put that on the table for the referendum where the citizens could chose whether or not they wanted that. Now it was still a big dark black whole on what would be the deal with the UK and they also forced themselves to work in that 2 year timeline (albeit the media kind of did that for asking when that article was going to be invoked time and time again). Without that 2 year timeframe it would've been a better outcome as no desperation from one side would be involved.

That being said, even if stuff is decided now, that doesn't ever mean that it will forever stay that way. The EU will find that certain things will not work out for them either and will start to make a new deal too. The Brits however shouldn't be so damn dramatic about everything and start working together (and yes that includes the folks that voted Leave) to address issues and see whatever deal they can make.

Political instability and climate-induced migration in Africa and the MENA (which you didn't list - but which is going to get fucked either way, either through unbearable desertification or disappearing oil revenue) is bound to end up seriously straining Europe. In fact, double that again because Russia, China and friends are going to replace the US as main security arbiter in both these regions. 

Furthermore, renewable (and therefore de-centralized) energy, desalination technology and non-agriculturally grown food are making constant progress. There isn't much reason to believe that the strategic and geopolitical dependencies you mentioned will still exist in that same magnitude 10 years from now.

And lastly, climate change will just be one factor that will shape the future among many others. It'll hit undeveloped, highly populated and disorganized regions the hardest, and the developed areas neighboring them will be the ones who have to deal with the consequences. But demographics, internal political stability and economic strength will be just as important in determining who is ""relevant"" in the world of tomorrow.

Meanwhile, others are comparatively much better off.

5039,"&gt;So you're saying that in signing a form that says ""I am a British citizen"" you are not in fact saying that you are a British citizen... Your mental gymnastics are impressive at least.

Where have I said anything of the sort? I'm saying that she has the right to be Irish, British or both, she can decide to be Irish only by getting rid of the British citizenship she holds by presumably being born to a British parent (as the UK doesn't provide citizenship by being born somewhere alone).  She can be any of those things, if she wants to be Irish only she has to claim her Irish citizenship and get rid of her British citizenship, if she wants both she has to claim her Irish citizenship, and if she just wants to be British she doesn't need to do anything.

&gt;I mean its obvious to me you and the home office are wrong, and its obvious to the UK court that you and the home office is wrong, so when the courts finish up and rule that she is Irish and only Irish and that she is not and never has been British then that will be the end of it and you'll finally uphold the GFA instead of pretending to.

I'm reasonably sure that the home office will be told to find a way of allowing people born in Northern Ireland and entitled to both citizenship's to get rid of UK citizenship. 

Maybe you could explain something to me though, if as you suggest people shouldn't have an automatic citizenship until someone can make a choice (Irish/British or both) how does that work? Are they stateless until they hit 18? Do they have some sort of quantum citizenship, they aren't stateless but we don't know what nationality they are until they decide? 

 &gt;Then we can talk again about how both forcing British Citizenship on her and also forbidding the Home Office to force British Citizenship are both upholding the GFA; because it can't be both so one of them isn't, its just a matter of the courts deciding which.

She can give up British citizenship...

5081,"&gt;I mean, he made an unnecessary bet on the future of UK and lost it.

Was it unnecessary? Pressure for a referendum had been growing since 2005 when all parties promised a referendum on the new EU treaty, the Labour decided a referendum wasn't necessary and signed it anyway. Gordon Brown was so ashamed of that position he decided not to attend the public signing and instead signed in private so there'd be no cameras to record it.

That created such outcry in the UK that in 2008 Nick Clegg wrote:

&gt;The debate about Europe has been a thorn in the side of British politics for decades. Now the wound has become infected. Europhile and Eurosceptic trading blows about the Lisbon treaty in grand rhetoric that obscures the facts. If you're pro-European, as I am, you're accused of being a sellout. If you're anti-European, like most Conservatives, you're accused of being a headbanger. It isn't new, but it isn't edifying either.

&gt;It's time we pulled out the thorn and healed the wound, time for a debate politicians have been too cowardly to hold for 30 years - time for a referendum on the big question. Do we want to be in or out? Nobody in Britain under the age of 51 has ever been asked that simple question. None of them were eligible to vote in that 1975 referendum. That includes half of all MPs. Two generations have never had their say.

and

&gt;But there are lots of people who disagree with me. Pro-Europeans have got to face up to the truth: the EU is not popular in Britain. It is perceived as distant, and is mistrusted. And some of the allegations levelled against it are hard to deny. The EU could be a lot more liberal and democratic, and the Lisbon treaty would help it to do both. So let's trust the people with the real question: in or out?

Clegg then tabled a motion for an in/out referendum, and staged a walkout of parliament when it was rejected. And Cameron came under intense attack from the media when he suggested he would no longer be able to hold a referendum on the Libson treaty (even though he obviously couldn't).

It's really bizarre that people see the problem is that the British people were asked whether they wanted to leave the EU, rather than the fact that they did actually want to. ",,/r/europe/comments/amr74j/mays_brexit_trilemma/efoybtu/,WhiteSatanicMills,1549240024

In any case, you've described the general gist of her current situation quite well, in that there is seemingly no majority for any of the solutions presented. This is what makes people sympathetic to her and think she's been dealt a rough hand.

But she's in this position of her own fault. First of all, of the solutions above, only B is really beyond consideration in terms of national interests. The rest are costly to either May or the Tory party politically, but that's the position she has put herself in.

Beyond that, and I stated above, you might be still be sympathetic-while we might like our politicians to put country before party and person, it's not really realistic. But all of this could have been avoided, if she had a/ as outlined above, taken the time to plan things out and realized this was the likely, or at least an, outcome and figured out how to avoid it/solve it or b/ not taken such a hard stance against a second referendum. Because a core issue is that even if you conceed that there's a majority for Brexit, there's certainly no majority for one form of Brexit. Those who are against a second referendum because a ""51/49 split in the other direction won't solve our problems"" are missing the fucking point-a ranked preference referendum of solutions, from the three or four possible Brexits, no-deal to soft to May's deal, to remain would undoubtedly solve the issue in front of us. But that's inconceivable because again, it's political suicide because of her lack of foresight and planning. 

The point is sympathizing with her because she's in a position where putting country first would have negative consequences for her party is already not a great reason. She's the leader of the gvt, it's her job. But when it's so clear that said position is her fault, easily avoidable at multiple stages, there's just no reason not to villify her.

My definition of not swapping actively would be swapping once it would have to be swapped anyway (due to aging or wearing). In order to have old trains run on them they'd require either variable axles or new axles, but that would be a tiny cost of rebuilding the railroad anyway.

I'll pull numbers out of my ass, but imagine that the non-standard stretch between two cities had to be replaced.
It wouldn't be cheap, never is, but has to be done anyway, 100 millions spent there. One would either raise the cost to 120 millions in order to build with a double gauge (and the EU could possibly subsidize standardization efforts) or swap the axles of the trains that run there (assuming that they don't run anywhere else), 100-something millions anyway.

20% extra cost might sound bad, but OTOH it might become profitable in the long run, once all of the tracks allow standard gauge, or even in the shorter run if one is able to snatch cheapo trains from the used market.",Somewhere south of Lisbon,/r/europe/comments/alrnem/brexit_economist_new_cartoon_from_kal/efoenfw/,claudio-at-reddit,1549224568

That has nothing to do with the legitimacy of the issue. I can make the same argument about the Americans preparing the maidan coup and supporting the opposition.

I am not willing to believe the Propaganda pf the evil Russians being responsible for everything that happened in Ukraine. It was patently obvious that both sides wanted this conflict and the people of the Ukraine had to pay the prize.

5435,"Yes, I read what he wrote, and unlike him and you I also managed to read and understand the article.  
They tried to impose a secret ballot **and succeeded**. The vote to make it transparent **was** done in secret.

Let me run the quote by you again:

&gt; Agendas for meetings between MEPs and interest representatives will be made public. That is **in spite of the secret ballot imposed** by the European People’s Party on the revision of the Parliament’s rules. MEPs adopted the transparency measure by a very small majority.

In other words, it managed to barely squeak by despite being secret.

But here, have some more sources that type it out in even simpler terms for you:

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-votes-for-more-transparency-in-dealing-with-lobbyists/a-47315320

&gt; European parliamentarians on Thursday voted in favor of more transparency in dealing with lobbyists. The vote, **which was held in secret** due to pressure from the body's conservative European People's Party (EPP), represents a change to existing rules of order.
The vote to make it transparent wasn't done in secret and voted on by elected representatives. The secret vote was trying to kill this and failed.72

https://euobserver.com/institutional/144057

&gt; But that German argument fell flat when MEPs, many of whom were holding up signs to publicly show their votes **since the ballot was held in secret**, backed the pro-transparency amendment attached to a rules of procedure report by British centre-left MEP Richard Corbett.

5442,"One thing to understand that EU funds are not free breakfasts, and that this flow is not one sided. Agricultural subisides which make up 40% of all EU payouts for example tend to go back into pockets of Western companies, since we lack large agrochemical and agromechanic industries. So of the euros Hungarian farmer gets many end up back at companies like Claas, CAT, Sygmenta, Bayer or New Holland. But the same can be said about many other items: Back in the mid-2000s it seemed like Austrian STRABAG was building literally every square inch road here. I can go on with many more examples. Hospital renovation? While the construction companies may be Hungarian, all that expensive medical machinery is imported from Germany.  

Now of course not every cent ends at Western corporations. But the very reasons we lack or used to lack companies serving all aspects of industry and service is that after '90 everything was privatized and in many cases even in the plant was profitable capital-rich Western companies bought it out and closed it. One thing that helped them a lot was the EU's PHARE (Poland and Hungary: Assistance for Restructuring their Economies) programme, a pre-accession preparation project. In the inital chapter of PHARE EU professional mapped out our economies to understand where aid is most needed. However this data greatly helped Western companies seeking to gain market, as they could pinpoint where they needed to enter. A particularly well-known case was the Hungarian steel industry, where by elminiation of one company like domino the whole chain collapsed.  

[Thomas Piketty](http://piketty.blog.lemonde.fr/2018/01/16/2018-the-year-of-europe/) wriote an interesting article about the perceived economic colonialism imposed on Eastern Europe. While his findings [were countered](http://bruegel.org/2018/02/what-is-the-financial-balance-of-eu-membership-for-central-europe/) by [many others](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-02-09/piketty-thinks-the-eu-is-bad-for-eastern-europe-he-s-half-right) (a Hungarian economist especially went full head against him) and I also don't agree with him in many points, I think its a good primer on the matter.    

Don't get me wrong I'm a big supporter of the EU, and personally I believe it was our nations leaders fault that even the functioning parts of our economies were destroyed, the western corporations merely stepped saying ""well if you are so stupid than so be it"".

5458,"Yes clearly. During the last protestations before yellow vests, syndicates launched strikes, there were barely followed by anyone. They hadn't success at any point during this time, and during ''la loi travail'' of Hollande they only worked for themself and not for people. People noticed that. They noticed, that syndicates worked for themself, they were weak and unfollowed. So they won't trust syndicates anymore, they searched another way to protest, and this was by internet. But this organization has an enormeous drawback, like this is not centralized, there is no main proposition to enforce, there are various little propositions. And like the gouvernment couldn't accept one big proposition and had nobody to negociate, so the protestation is condamned to repeat itself.

Yes, they have a in common. The tendency for complotism, is the biggest one. But Trump supporters support this mouvement cause they see it as a possibility to beat and make an end to the biggest diplomatical and political threat to Trump.

And he assumed this role way better than Trudeau who is to shy for it, and Merkel who is too old (politicaly) for it. A make a front against a worldwide's Trump mouvement (Bolsonaro is an exemple). To show Macron as weak in is own country, serves a purpose. To show that the political model that Macron present is a failure. And so to destroy any liberal democracies resistant at the world scale, to spread Trump ideology.

Understanding, of course, that there are strategic targets other than military facilities - such as the propaganda network which has placed itself at the disposal of a dictator and as such is an active participant in the conflict.

Of course, Poland isn't as rich as WE. In fact, in the foreseeable future (I mean centuries) it won't be. I know you guys hate the ""Polish victim complex"", but the victimhood is very much real. In 1945 Poland was mostly in ruins, Warsaw was as destroyed as Hiroshima, the elites were murdered or abroad, and what awaited us was 45 years of Soviet occupation and exploitation. Then the shackles are dropped and the economy skyrockets (well before any structural funds from the EU). But still, the average Pole born today and well into the future will always be poorer than their WE peers, strictly because of WWII and Yalta.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm saying this is I think that most people from Western Europe (excluding maybe Germans, they are more aware) fail to understand what the basic reality was for the ""Eastern Bloc"" 1945-1989. Poland always was and still is a very open, Western european country which fell victim to geopolitics. Now, to hear that Poland ""owes"" to WE for it's development post 1989 is slightly infuriating, as the Western countries benefited exactly as much from us joining as we did.

As to your question - the reasons for the mischief is that the commies managed to preserve their power through creating parties in all of the political spectrum and using the government to suppress any legitimate opposition. Hell, our own prime minister is the bodyguard of the last dictator (but you know this kind of strategies very well in Russia, don't you). As to the EE mentality and location, I don't agree. Look at Poland or Czechia - thriving Slavic ex-communist countries. So, growth and political success in this part of the world are defined by the quality of the anti-communist purge, the quality of the political independence from the modern Russian state and the amount of economic devastation in result of the socialist misgovernment. 

And as of immigration, it's much more complicated than that. For one, Germany tried to get the best of the migrants and get rid of the poorly educated in other countries, which of course failed. Besides, migration is not frowned upon, at least not in Bulgaria. For instance there are a lot of migrants from the ex-USSR countries, Greece, Armenia and the like.

Now, a power block like the EU can punish the tax havens enough so that they'd change their tax laws.

Or foreign superpowers like China can control the Portuguese economy if they wanted to.

-

&gt; …Special Advisor to Prime Minister David Cameron on Central and Eastern Europe and on Central and Eastern Europeans living in the United Kingdom.

-

&gt; Since becoming the chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Poland in 2014, Kawczynski has supported a range of enterprises from his constituency in seeking business partners and export markets in Poland and other Central and Eastern European countries, offering support and advice.[45] Kawczynski has been a frequent visitor to the British Polish Chamber of Commerce in Warsaw where he often described the importance of trade between Poland and the United Kingdom.

-

&gt; During a visit on 1 September 2014, Kawczynski stressed the need for the Polish diaspora in the UK to foster the trade relationship between the two countries.

-

No shit, that's the intent of the security council. The point is to stop large scale military conflicts and the involvement of great powers in said conflicts. But nonetheless it's not enough because apparently international law doesn't apply to countries like the United States, China or Russia.

&gt;can you explain why it was morally wrong to intervene to stop an authoritarian regime from conducting ethnic cleansing under the guise of an anti-terrorist operation?

First of all, I like that you say it's an anti terrorist operation because the albanian separatist militant organisation that fought in Kosovo, the UCK was actually considered a terrorist organization by the United States too until they decided to support them and fight on their side. Then they suddenly became valiant fighters for freedom and liberty.

But to answer your question, it was wrong because NATO targeted non-military buildings and facilities and because it killed civilians that goes way beyond what one could call ""collateral damage"". Not to mention that during the NATO intervention, the number of war crimes committed in Kosovo only increased not decreased. Also, ethnic cleansing was committed by the Albanians as well, yet they weren't punished in any way, they were even rewarded by getting their own state that is run by UCK warlords like Thaci and Haradinaj.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/amhv4x/macedonia_to_sign_nato_pact_this_week/efnjh0a/,Petique,1549196276

There wasn't even Turkification or anything near to it, nor a Turksih nation being build by then, yet you need to wait more than a decade for it. If you're trying to find French kind of nation building process during 1915 and such which came with said assimilation policies, then you're just confused and no different than someone who is trying to find Tito policies in the Yugoslav King's acts. Assuming a push for ethnostate by then and by Three Pashas is also absurd, sorry.

5727,"&gt; That's completely derailed. I can't remember saying we need to shoot EVERY wolf in central Europe.

But that was the point I was talking about, that you took offence to. 

&gt;By no means there would be a solution which demands wolves being killed preemtively, as you call it. It needs to be regulated. The game law allows regulation of population. You can keep it under control. As we do it with every other wild animal as well.

Agreed. The wolf population is very small though, so the hunting decisions should be made in such a way that it doesn't endanger the population. 

&gt;Get dogs, apply for compensatin,...all good. 

Do Guard dogs not work? Or fences? 

&gt;Green position here in Austria is: leave the wolves under protection, I think that is true for german green party as well.

That's right, and I think it should stay that way, at least until the population has regenerated enough. 

&gt;once again: I do hate the compensation attitude, it is very neoliberal attitude. Give them money, they should shut up. While on the other hand ""they"" want the wolf staying protected.

I don't understand that. It's a compromise in my opinion. If the government wants a wolf population, it needs to take steps to ensure that the economical impact isn't too big, one of these steps is to ensure that farmers don't suffer loss of income because their lifestock is killed. 

The government can't really do anything else. There is no way to make it right again. My parents neighbour lost their son to a drunk driver, and no matter what, there is nothing that can ever be done to make up for that loss. In the same vein, nothing can make up for the tragedy that is finding dismembered corpses of your lifestock and having to dispose of them later. 

&gt; By the way: hunter lobby in Austria is strictly against shooting wolves. As long as wolves are under NaturschutzG, the state has to pay compensation, not hunters. It's mainly farmers who demand hunt.

Okay. Maybe the hunters I have talked to have been horrible people. Maybe I have been wrong about that. I can accept that. 

&gt;It's a very complicated thing, but treating wolves as endangered species needing protection is outdated and a complete dead end.

But they kinda are.  IF you want a healthy population in germany, they need protection for now. This protection has the be revisited and eventually relaxed as the population grows. ",Germany,/r/europe/comments/amf0nd/grey_wolves_of_europe/efnf793/,HYxzt,1549188691

5743,"I get it that you are Russian and because of this defend your country (I get it). But as far as it gets in Eastern Europe, things are bad where the commies ruled. In Bulgaria, let me give it as an example, before 1945 we had a flourishing Tsardom with an economy roughly the size that of Denmark at the time with a strong agricultural sector. The policy of the Tsar at the time was to avoid getting involved in WW2 which was possible until Italy messed up its invasion in Greece. Thus Hitler, having to send troops there, had to pass through our country. In order to preserve the populations from the Nazis, the country entered the war on the side of the Axis, yet refusing to send even one soldier to the Eastern front and not only refused to send the Bulgarian Jews to the camps but actively helped them leave for secure areas of the world by giving them visas. Yet in 1944 the USSR declared war on our country and instigated a coup. The commies, having secured their power through bloodshed, murdered more people for ""collaboration with the Nazis"" in illegal courts than the French did in their Denazification process. The following half century was time of bad economic decisions including construction of heavy industries which were not sustainable because we lacked the resources. The Bulgarian villages got deserted because of the active policy of purging private entrepreneurship and in a result the country got bankrupt several times. 

Those issues are still there - the villages have difficulties getting reborn again, the backbone of the economy is broken and much of the reserves of the country got stolen by the commies. So yes, the USSR and its communists and by an extent Russia have a lot to do with our hardship.

5773,"Article is premium, I created a free trial just to read the insane comments 

&gt;On Wednesday, MEPs held a Two Minutes Hate against Britain. It wasn’t called that, obviously. Its official title was “The UK’s Withdrawal from the EU (debate)”. But it resembled the “hideous ecstasy of vindictiveness” described by George Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four far more than it resembled a parliamentary debate.

&gt;Journalists focused on the relatively restrained assertions by Michel Barnier, Jean-Claude Juncker and the other bigwigs that the backstop was non-negotiable and Britain should do as it was told. But the rank-and-file MEPs who spoke afterwards felt less need to be diplomatic. Guy Verhofstadt, the Liberal leader, warned us, “you gonna pay the price!” So bellicose was his tone that even the arch-Europhile Edwina Currie was prompted to respond, “Honestly, Guy, we British don’t like being told what to do. And shouting at us makes it worse.”

&gt;Elmar Brok, a German Christian Democrat who blows aggressively through his moustache when he talks, and who is currently embroiled in allegations about profiteering from EU-funded constituency visits, dispensed with any niceties:

&gt;“The European market is fourteen times larger than the British. Companies will move away. Anyone who produces for the European market will leave Britain. It’s going to be bitter for the UK – bad for us, but bitter for you!”

&gt;MEPs cheered rapturously. That’s what happens during the Two Minutes Hate. Individually, many MEPs are polite and reasonable. But get them together for a virtue-signalling rally and they vie to outdo each other with harder and harder language.

&gt;And that, in a nutshell, is the dynamic driving Eurocrats towards no deal. There is no logic in their position. If the choice is between, on the one hand, no backstop but everything else agreed and, on the other, no backstop and nothing else either, there is only one rational option. As Detlef Seif, the Brexit rapporteur for Mr Brok’s party in the German Bundestag puts it, “If the EU now sticks to the proposed backstop without offering any compromises, this will cause the outcome that all sides most want to avoid”.

&gt;Indeed. All sides. The eurozone is growing more slowly than the UK (to the undisguised annoyance of the Financial Times). Italy is in recession. This week, the German finance ministry downgraded its growth forecast for 2019 from 1.8 per cent to one per cent, citing Brexit as the primary cause. How bizarre, then, to threaten needless economic dislocation over a backstop that Dublin, London and Brussels all insist they don’t want or expect to see activated.

 &gt;It’s not as if anyone is still seriously pretending that the absence of a backstop will mean checkpoints and border posts. The Irish government has confirmed that, if there is no deal, it will not raise any frontier infrastructure. The British government has said the same from the beginning. Last month, Mr Barnier revealed that, in a no deal scenario, any necessary checks would be carried out away from the border. In other words, the whole bogus row has been got up over a border that no one is going to install anyway.

&gt;This point is not yet widely understood in Europe, where the backstop is vaguely but forcefully presented in most media as being there to “ensure peace”. But, as the deadline looms, several Continental MPs are asking the same question as Mr Seif. Why, when Britain has caved in to every other EU demand, carry on insisting on the one thing that Parliament can’t accept?

&gt;The incentives in Brussels, though, are not the same as those in the national capitals. For EU functionaries, this isn’t about finding a mutually beneficial outcome. Rather it is about, as Juncker put it during the referendum, “punishing deserters”. This is especially true of the chief Commission official, the Anglophobic Martin Selmayr, who is determined that Britain must suffer for Brexit, even if that makes everyone else suffer too.

&gt;It might sound irrational, but look at it from the point of view of the European Commission. Whatever the economic costs of Brexit, they will not be borne by Eurocrats, whose tax-free salaries and expenses will remain unaffected. Indeed, if no deal leads to the EU imposing tariffs on UK exports, the Commission will get extra revenue from them.

&gt;Most member states – especially those which conduct a lot of trade with Britain, such as Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands – are aghast at the prospect of tariffs. Likewise, many of the states with large expatriate populations here – populations which vote in their countries of origin – don’t want to risk an equitable settlement of citizens’ rights over a border that no one is ever going to install. Hence Poland’s suggestion that the backstop be time-limited.

&gt;The question is whether these nations can impose their will on the Commission. So far, they haven’t, and it may be that they simply can’t. After all, as Leavers argued during the referendum campaign, one of the problems with the EU is that power has shifted from the national capitals to Brussels. Even when the member states are technically in charge, they often find it impractical to defy the Eurocrats.

&gt;I can already hear the Europhile sneering. For some British people, everything must always be the fault of Brexiteers. They will not hear any criticism of Brussels, however peevish, illogical or dishonest its stance. Point out that the EU is being less than reasonable and they come back with “Oh, blaming someone else, are you?”

&gt;Damn right I’m blaming someone else. In part, I’m blaming a remote, self-serving caste of officials with little interest in the welfare of the citizens they notionally serve. But, far more seriously, I’m blaming those British Europhiles who have encouraged the EU to take the hardest possible line in the hope of derailing Brexit. Every time MPs declare that they won’t allow no deal, they signal to Brussels that there is no point in engaging in constructive talks. After all, if no deal is not an option then, by definition, Britain must either accept whatever humiliating terms it is offered or drop Brexit completely. 

&gt;It’s even worse than that, though. The legislation needed to prepare for Brexit, deal or no deal, is being systematically delayed and frustrated in the House of Lords. It is important to understand quite how scandalously the blocking peers are behaving. They are not making no deal less likely; they’re just ensuring that it will be needlessly painful if it happens. It’s as if they secretly want to punish the electorate for its decision in 2016. So, yes, I do blame them. And I suspect I’m not alone.

It started some kind of divide that started seeping into policies that sick aren't to be trusted. That they cannot be **that** sick that they cannot work. And as swedes in general trust systems the ones who never was sick or didn't know anyone who was started to distrust. 

The one who was sick (and no longer trustes) got awful treatment from FK and stopped trusting the system. We started a divide,  we no longer share the same idea/view about what life in sweden is.

5962,"&gt; You say this, but britian was small and a global superpower for a very long time.

During the time it was a global superpower, Britain also controlled 25% of the world's land and had the largest population in the world. Its navy was stronger than the next two most powerful navies put together. 

&gt; China was much larger than the west but was unable to compete against them in years past

China went through several devastating wars, both foreign and domestic, and suffered from a variety of issues including an inability to industrialise. 

&gt; India went the same way to Britain.

India was never fully unified and British conquests on the continent took place slowly and relied heavily on playing the local power politics game. 

&gt; Russia is relatively small but still held superpower status too.

Russia at the time of its height was the second largest contiguous empire in the world (behind only the Mongol Empire) and is today still the largest country on Earth.

5987,"&gt; which is the pre-eminent historical database, uses PPP for all its calculations of historical GDP series.

That's because they have no other option. They don't have reliable currency exchange and GDP statistics so their primary source has to be indicators of real output and purchasing power.

&gt; Incidentally, Maddison also significantly downgrades Turkish GDP per capita compared to your (hilariously inaccurate) official series. This should not be surprising, as I've already explained to you.

You never managed to explain why it was supposed to be ""hilariously inaccurate."" The explanation I gave you was horrifying compared to fudged statistics, which you never caught on to either. You chose to ignore my explanation for various points you had raised so the onus is still on you.

Meyersson never actually makes the claim that the new series is definitely fraudulent, he signs off by proposing that the main source of the difference paints an unhealthy picture, which I have been telling you all along.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/amhxki/a_tale_of_two_countries/efn9hck/,_Whoop,1549179225

5994,"1. education is not bad, it's beyond terrible. Poland has been anti science for over 3 centuries now.

2. Country is extremely religional and conservative. Good luck marinating job as an atheist in many places lol if the topic ever comes up

3. Culture is... Ok, it's based on racism, bigotry and decadence. Happy drunks are not a stereotype, they are a fact. 12.5% population is overusing alcohol. Stigma against mental health, religion, color or even educated people is extereme. 10 month average waiting time for therapy.

4. Medical care is not there either. We have almost no psychiatric care despite one of the highest amounts of people suffering. It takes a few days for most emergency procedures and a few months for most other.

5. Our economy is shiiiit. Yeah, sure, we're growing but income gap is growing too. Idk, I don't feel like getting 2k euro a month with a master's while being expected to work 60 hours a week under immense pressure. It's laughable

6. Employment culture is terrible. 

7. We have government supported natzis

8. We do not have journalism. At all. Qualitative assessments approximate roughly 40% fake/misreported news, both in public and opposition run TV

9. People are generally terrible. There are so many extremists, anti science people and ignorant arrogant cunts who just want to destroy others lives

10. We have one of the most complex procedures for taxes, official documents, permits and even things like passing finals at a different school. Most officials are unhelpful and uncooperative

11. We normalize child abuse and violence

12. Our jurisdiction doesn't work
