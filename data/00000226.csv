1. We allowed Turkey to educate the Childrens.

Those Teachers were literally insulting Germans during their lessons, for not believing in Islam, for eating Pork, and so on. Overall they worked hard to keep their citizens separated. When Children came out of school they could barely speak German. Comparable to how the Germans could speak English. That lead to very few reaching higher degrees of education. 

2. No language courses for the old people. Some of them still barely speak German. Nobody ever cared to make them learn something.

No Turk was forced into a ghetto, but a mix of not being able to speak German and moderate Racism forced them into accepting all kinds of low wage jobs. Low wage means they need a apartment with a affordable rent. And since they were pretty nationalistic, could not speak german and had no really positive view of Germans they preferred to stick together. 

I also saw the opposite, though. Parents that took their children out of these Turkish classes early enough.

111,"&gt; No, it isn't.

Yes it is.

&gt;Give me one racist thing Trump has said? 

Are you for real? 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_views_of_Donald_Trump

There you go. It is your president, so you should educate yourself.

&gt; And point out his ""racist agenda""?

You really forgot what he campaigned on and the fact that he brought actual white surpremacists into the white house?

&gt; Yes, because we care about diversity

Yeah, that is why you focus mostly on things like skin color. True diversity.

&gt;and representation here,

That is why you have a two party system, with a shit ton of gerrymandering and voter laws designed to disproportionately affect minorities.

&gt; as opposed to sweeping it under the rug and pretending it doesn't exist

Your little magical American race categories are social constructs that are total bullshit from an empirical perspective. And yet your government does its best to perpetuate them needlessly.

&gt; I'm not sure how encouraging people to categorize their race on official papers is ""racist""? 

Holy shit. You do know that there are no human races right? That you guys are just making up racist bullshit there? Which will influence how people will perceive and interpret all their future interactions further down the line?

&gt; Do not understand the political shitstorm that would happen here if we removed race from ""official forms""? There would be people (rightfully) calling that racist, because the inclusion of those options was fought for in the past by civil rights groups.

We all can see how well your current approach works.

&gt;Don't talk about things you don't understand.

You are here talking about ""Europe"" all the time.

&gt;No, this isn't even **remotely** true, Jesus Christ.

What Trump supporter was not triggered by this? More than enough people went apeshit. I also read that over 50% of American whites thought that dude was doing the wrong thing by taking the knee. And I mean, this stuff is not even new anyways:

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/05/white-sports-fans-nfl-black-athletes-race-protest

&gt;I know what doesn't happen here that does happen in Europe though; people throwing bananas and making monkey noises at black soccer players.

http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/22041345/racism-continued-rear-ugly-head-sports-2017

&gt;According to research from the University of Central Florida's Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, acts of racism in sports in the U.S. increased from 31 in 2016 to 41 in 2017. Internationally, there were 79 racist acts in sports.

And:

&gt;Despite these courageous acts, racism continued to permeate sports. In May, Baltimore Orioles center fielder **Adam Jones said that he was berated with racial slurs and that a bag of peanuts was thrown at him during a game against at Boston's Fenway Park.** Jones later called it one of the worst experiences of his 12-year career. This incident led to support from a number of athletes, including Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green, who said he had experienced similar indignities.

So much for that.

&gt;  I think that's far worse than

115,"To be fair, I have never migrated anywhere. However i spend a year in a different country and talked to people who migrated there from Germany. 

What i know however is that they migrated to this country because they loved their new home and the culture. Sure they were born German and thus inherently had German traits (and will have for the rest of their live) however they tried hard to integrated and they sure as hell didn't raise their kids as Germans. 

Özil however did not migrate to Germany. He was born here. His parents migrated here and they raised him as a Turk. In 2017 he stated that he still has a hard time speaking German [(source in German)](https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/article163153522/Noch-heute-muss-ich-mich-konzentrieren-wenn-ich-Deutsch-rede.html) and he released his statement in English not German.

He meets with a racist ""President"" that is seen as a Dictator in Germany and reasons with the words: ""[...] the truth is that not meeting with the President would have been disrespecting the roots of my ancestors [...]"" while ending his 4Page message with ""Racism should never, ever be accepted"". 

What this is, is a nationalistic view of a Turk defending his President. 

Taking a step back, he was born into a pretty shitty position. Born into a family of Turks that is living in a foreign country, not because they wanted to live there but because they had work there and he was raised as part Turk, part German. By now the Germans don't accept him as a German and the Turks don't take him as a complete Turk. It's really a shitty situation. He basically has to decide into what culture he wants to integrate into and he has a head start for 2 cultures. 

Germans have a high acceptance for foreign workers.

I'm sorry but, your post is just dumb. Lets go through this piece by piece.

Nothing you in that Wikipedia link you presented is new information to me. The most ""racist"" thing he said there was calling African nations shitholes, which they are absolutely *are* if you don't want to sugarcoat your words. The highest levels of poverty, disease, crime, famine, etc. Anything negative, you name it, and it applies to vast swaths of Africa. Calling it a ""shithole"" is just the non-politically correct way of addressing it. Not ""racist"".

&gt;You really forgot what he campaigned on

Vague jingoistic statements of ""making America great again""? Building a wall on the Mexican border? Where's the racism again? Just because you don't like what he's saying doesn't make it ""racist"". Enforcing your borders isn't a ""racist"" view to have. And if it is, you had better acknowledge the whole of Eastern Europe as racist, instead of circlejerking over Trump. Because nothing Trump has said or done compares to what happens there.

&gt;Yeah, that is why you focus mostly on things like skin color. True diversity.

This might come as a shock to you, but countries in the New World don't just consider different cultures as being diverse, but also different skin colors among the population. We don't consider *just* different races as being diverse you nimrod. Europe wouldn't know, since they're mostly racially homogeneous. And as you can see from this sub, the idea of brown people coming to their countries terrifies a whole lot of them. It's the reason countries like Italy and Hungary have voted in proto-fascists (*actual* fascists, you know, something Trump and the Republican party are nowhere near).

&gt;Your little magical American race categories are social constructs that are total bullshit from an empirical perspective. And yet your government does its best to perpetuate them needlessly.

I hope you're trolling, because we have laws and programs that specifically target individual races. And we have those laws and programs in place for a variety of historical reasons.

&gt;You do know that there are no human races right

But you in particular seem to have an issue with me saying that Europe is more racist than the US, which is absolutely true.

180,"&gt; That's literally what Himmler and Nazis were planning for Latvia

Let's look at the facts, these are numbers of ethnic Latvians in Latvia by years:

1959: 1 297 881

1970: 1 341 805

1979: 1 344 105

1989: 1 387 757

2000: 1 370 703

2011: 1 285 136

2018: 1 269 922

As you can see, number of Latvians grew, Latvia was developing, but yes, there were workers from other parts of the USSR so share declined indeed.

Look what happened when brutal USSR stopped ""eradicating"" Latvians: their number started to decline, what a coincidence.
You may answer that now people freely choose better life in western countries but the result is real eradication of Latvians. You are saying that USSR was assimilating Latvians, but now they get assimilated in other countries on their own.

If, for example, in year 2100 population of Latvia will be just 500 000 with 100% share of ethnic Latvians, will it make people like you happy?

&gt;The most ""racist"" thing he said there was calling African nations shitholes

What about this?

&gt;In his 1991 book Trumped! John O'Donnell quoted Trump as saying:

&gt;    I've got black accountants at Trump Castle and at Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys wearing yarmulkes.... Those are the only kind of people I want counting my money. Nobody else... Besides that, I tell you something else. I think that's guy's lazy. And it's probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks.

&gt; In an interview in 1997, he admitted that the information in the book was ""probably true"". 

Totally not racist. I will not even address the rest of your bullshit there because it is not worth my time. You can google a virtually infinite amount of statements by Trump that anybody but his supporters would deem racist.

&gt;Vague jingoistic statements 

What about: His muslim ban. Steve Bannon and co in the white house. His relativizing of Nazi violence. There really *is* a reason his presidency emboldened racists:

Literally racist bullshit. You are so racist you cannot even perceive it anymore. It is just normal for you. // Oh wait, you are literally a ""race realist"". Why not just own up to being a racist then!?

&gt;&gt;Your little magical American race categories are social constructs that are total bullshit from an empirical perspective. And yet your government does its best to perpetuate them needlessly.

&gt;Got any reputable scientists that agree with you or no?

So you are a race realist? Good to know. You are a literal racist. To answer your question:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_%28human_categorization%29#Models_of_human_evolution

&gt;The first to challenge the concept of race on empirical grounds were the anthropologists Franz Boas, who provided evidence of phenotypic plasticity due to environmental factors,[60] and Ashley Montagu, who relied on evidence from genetics.[61] E. O. Wilson then challenged the concept from the perspective of general animal systematics, and further rejected the claim that ""races"" were equivalent to ""subspecies"".[62]

&gt; Human genetic variation is predominantly within races, continuous, and complex in structure, which is inconsistent with the concept of genetic human races.[63] According to Jonathan Marks,[35]

&gt;   By the 1970s, it had become clear that (1) most human differences were cultural; (2) what was not cultural was principally polymorphic – that is to say, found in diverse groups of people at different frequencies; (3) what was not cultural or polymorphic was principally clinal – that is to say, gradually variable over geography; and (4) what was left – the component of human diversity that was not cultural, polymorphic, or clinal -was very small.

&gt;    A consensus consequently developed among anthropologists and geneticists that race as the previous generation had known it – as largely discrete, geographically distinct, gene pools – did not exist.

You are literally arguing against the scientific consensus.

&gt;&gt;You do know that there are no human races right

&gt; Got any reputable scientists that agree with you or no?

Lol at you thinking that your position is the one backed by science.

&gt;&gt;You are here talking about ""Europe"" all the time.

&gt; Well I was responding to a Canadian that was trashing the US and jerking off Europe etc blabla

Work on your reading comprehension.

&gt; But you in particular seem to have an issue with me saying that Europe is more racist than the US

Because it is not true. 

&gt;And your only counter argument is 

So you ignore all the other things I mentioned? A Trump supporter behaving like a disingenuous cunt. What a surprise.

&gt;  is that we acknowledge different races.....which is a fucking stupid argument, because Europeans do so as well.

Yeah no. Your weird race categories are not ""acknowledged"" by the majority of Europeans and the EU, and probably the majority of European countries, made clear that they do not believe in such ""racial stuff"".

&gt;I won't even bother addressing the rest of your post, because it damn near gave me an aneurysm.

Then they will hopefully change their course and I can vote for the SPD again. But today those party’s are a total clusterfuck.


There aren‘t any good alternatives either. Our Greens are somewhat ok, but they want to ban so many things and I like my freedom. The Left currently is supporting the shitstorm in Venezuela so I can‘t vote for them. The liberals are too neoliberal so I can‘t vote for them. 
AfD/NPD are neonazis. CxU/sPD are, as I said, a clusterfuck.

And then everyone is wondering why nobody is going to votes anymore.

I hate the current political situation.

Unless you move to the area, Chinese is unlikely to be particularly useful. The same can be said about Hindi.

I agree with the poster above, in no scenario is it good for the propaganda war not to speak the language of the adversary rather than shunning it. The blackout strategy is self defeating. Only when there truly is no influence and other languages take priority it would make sense. 

Since (business) English is so dominating elsewhere, Russian definitely is the third language to learn after the native and English, in the Baltics. Generally speaking, of course.

&gt;just because a mother has a husband means jack shit for their lifestyle

Thats a massive no no. Any psychologist knows not having a father figure is very very bad.

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/23/barack-obama/statistics-dont-lie-in-this-case/

Also, all but one mass shooting was perpetrated by single mother child in US in 2017.

&gt;Where does it say this was initiated by the federal government? That was the question. After all, you were convinced this is Obama's fault.

Obama had this thing where he gathered representatives from all the states police. He told them to stop profile people and took away the heavy riot gear. That made it unsafe for riot control and lowered police presence. The media prob played a larger role. Media pushed people to have their phone out in their face. Makes them feel uncorfortable and if they screw up they will be in physical harm as well as have a witch hunt. Darren wilson killed a black guy in self defense and the media rails him for a month. They knew ot was self defense but pushed it as a hate crime and police hunting black people.


&gt;China has engaged in massive economical partnerships with Europe, in addition to major investments in Africa. If they are looking at conquest, it's going to happen in the form of corporate acquisitions.

Countries change. Very rapidly. If you were alive in 1970 would you think the USSR would be gone? How about china? Would you have though it would be an economic powerhouse? Im not dissagreeing that rn it's not fonna onvade the world but things change.

&gt;Um .. are you accounting for the ""inflation"" bit in ""Great Inflation"", too? Obviously, income will rise when the money

Look. In 1940, black income was rising. After a massive recession they had the strongest recovery. Look 50 eyars after 1970. They are the same if not worse. They income has stagnated and fallen. No recession is 50 years long and the rest of the country recovered. Its not natural in any way for this to be a natural side effect of recession. Its bad policy.

&gt;Of course it does. A person's situation influences a great many factors, from how likely they are to do drugs in order to feel better

Crime like i said. Is mostly caused by mental illness, parental neglect/single mother hood and high inequality.

Places with little inequality can be very poor but have little crime. Black neighborhoods with as much as 80% single motherhood has massive amounts of crime. As to the compounding effect, some crime is caused, either by race riots or inequality from poor minority groups moving in, crime level rises. Poor people stay while rich leave. The poor congregate into a slum with no investment since a culture of crime is there with nothing else to do. There is no father and the kid has NO discipline. There is no pushback to dumb shit the kid does and no one teaches him to play fair and not hurt people. Since he never learns to nkt be violent to get qhat he wants he carries that habit into adulthood.

Hell there's even a [current opera](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-kronos-my-lai-review-20180312-story.html) based on that tragedy. Not that a fucking opera makes up for the massacre, and soldiers should have been properly prosecuted, but for something that happened 50 years ago during a war we hear about it all the time. 

&gt;Jonathan Berger's opera ""My Lai"" — written for the Kronos Quartet, tenor Rinde Eckert and Vân-Ánh Võ, a virtuoso player of traditional Vietnamese instruments — takes place during the last hallucinatory days of Hugh Thompson Jr. He was the U.S. Army helicopter pilot in the Vietnam War who flew over the massacre in My Lai.  
&gt;  
&gt;When Thompson's whistle-blowing was finally reported in 1969, the public perception of the Vietnam War began to change.  
&gt;  
&gt;In ""My Lai,"" Death stalks but one man, but that man stands for all the innocents who died in the village, and they stand for the tens of thousands who died in the war.  
&gt;  
&gt;After a half-century, it is now easy enough to memorialize the dead of My Lai and honor Thompson to assuage our collective guilt. That's not Berger's ""My Lai."" The work does not truck in anodyne catharsis even as it reminds us of our ability to stumble across beauty when there is otherwise no meaning, only insanity, to be found.

As for your 'Japan isn't even that bad' statement:

&gt;China and South Korea called on Japan to face up to its wartime past after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent an offering to a shrine to war dead on Tuesday, the anniversary of Japan’s World War Two surrender.  
&gt;  
&gt;Past visits by Japanese leaders to Yasukuni have outraged Beijing and Seoul because it honors 14 Japanese leaders convicted by an Allied tribunal as war criminals, along with other war dead, sometimes chilling ties for months.  
&gt;  
&gt;China’s relations with Japan have long been poisoned by what Beijing sees as Tokyo’s failure to atone for its occupation of parts of China before and during World War Two. Japan occupied Korea from 1910-1945.

&gt;Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign: Surviving airmen parachuted and hid among the Chinese civilians who provided them shelter. Out of 64 that managed to bail out, eight were captured and executed almost immediately by the Japanese. In the search for the remaining US airmen, the Japanese conducted a thorough search, executing, pillaging and burning entire villages as an act of retribution for aiding the Americans.  
&gt;  
&gt;The result was a devastating trail of 250,000 dead Chinese civilians. The Commander-in-Chief at the time was Field Marshall Shunroku Hata, the man behind the Changjiao Massacre.  
&gt;  
&gt;After the war, in 1948, he was sentenced to life in prison but was paroled only six years later, in 1954. Until his death in 1962, he was a respected public figure and a head of the charitable organisation “Kaikosha”, established to aid the Japanese war veterans.  
&gt;  
&gt;Burma Railway construction: During the construction of the Burma Railway, which was a vital Japanese supply route at the time, 80,000-100,000 of the local Malayan population and more than 13,000 of Allied POWs  (British, Dutch, Australian and American) lost their lives in a year-long period from 1943 to 1944.  
&gt;  
&gt;Manilla Massacre: During lulls in the battle for control of the city, the Japanese under the command of General Yamashita took out their anger and frustration on the civilians, demonstrating the true madness of war and defeat. Mutilations, rapes and massacres occurred in schools, hospitals and convents. A local hotel was used as a “rape center”.  
&gt;  
&gt;These women, many of them 12 to 14 years old, were then taken to the hotel, where they were raped. The estimated total number of civilian casualties was over 100,000, and the city was left utterly destroyed.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Changjiao Massаcre: During WWII, the Japanese Imperial Army imposed a scorched earth strategy on China. It was called “The Three Alls Policy” – “kill all, burn all, loot all”. In just four days (9-12 March 1943), the  Changjiao Massacre claimed the lives of 30,000 people and was infamous for it’s Army approved mass rape campaign which affected thousands of women.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I personally severed more than forty heads. Today, I no longer remember each of them well. It might sound extreme, but I can almost say that if more than two weeks went by without my taking a head, I didn’t feel right. Physically, I needed to be refreshed.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Sook Ching Massacre: “Purge through cleansing” – Sook Ching, was a Japanese military operation directed towards the “hostile elements” in Singapore after the fall of the city to Japanese rule. The massacre lasted from 18 February to 4 March 1942 and claimed the lives of as many as 30,000 to 100,000 people.

&gt;	Most Muslim youth in my country act ""tough"" and hang out a lot on the streets and near supermarkets doing petty crime, listening to rap music, and most of the time drugs is also involved. If you don't bother them, they won't bother you though. You can really tell the difference between Dutch youth and Muslim youth. Partly the reason why they don't really associate with each other. Not saying Dutch youth doesn't do (deal) drugs, petty crime or listen to rap but it's being done in lesser amounts.

Yeah, they act tough here too all the time. Seems to be a cultural thing given to them by their parents. It‘s a shame that the state can‘t to more to educate them our values. But I don‘t have much better ideas either.

Well tbh, I get my drugs from Germans, they get their drugs from Germans, so I guess the criminal market is „fairly“ balanced?

Where does it say this was initiated by the federal government? That was the question. After all, you were convinced this is Obama's fault.

&gt; Poverty doesnt cause crime, maybe theft but not murder.

Of course it does. A person's situation influences a great many factors, from how likely they are to do drugs in order to feel better, to how aggressive they get as a consequence of their surroundings and psychological stress.

Of the links you provided, the first makes a flawed argument that crime is caused by honest people getting robbed, and then .. what? Turning to crime themselves? The source doesn't say. It also doesn't say what motivated the robber. Was the robber at some point getting robbed as well? By whom? By another person who just started robbery because they were robbed, too? This is literally the same as saying ""the chicken came before the egg"".

The second source, meanwhile, oozes ideological bias, even going as far as to say that moral behavior is caused by religion (but only Christianity, of course), which I guess means that atheists like me are actually criminals-in-hiding. But hey, if the author of that article really is the same Dennis Prager who staunchly opposes gay marriage by principle, and throws a hissy fit because in a nation where the state should be separate from the church an elected official didn't want to swear on bible, I guess that shouldn't surprise much.

The logical fallacy in looking at even poor people statistically having a home and a TV, and concluding that this means they ""obviously"" have no reason to commit crimes, is still mind-bogging, moreso in a country that is notorious for the amount of debt its consumerist citizens amass, or considering the fairly low prices of said goods in question. What kid growing up in the ghetto is going to turn away from crime only because their parents own a TV?

&gt; Im not going into individuals here but the statistics in upper class majority black neighborhoods are small.

Meaning what? And do ""upper class majority black neighborhoods"" even exist in the US? Black people are a minority of the populace, and tend to come from poorer backgrounds, which makes me suspect they'd have little representation among the upper class, and integrate into majority-white neighborhoods in terms of lifestyle.

&gt; Income growth and nuclear family were intact through those events.

Um .. are you accounting for the ""inflation"" bit in ""Great Inflation"", too? Obviously, income will rise when the money is worth less. That means very little when prices spike. Furthermore, this event was accompanied by a massive rise in unemployment, and I would expect this to have serious consequences in terms of livelihood.

And the nuclear family back then was more of a thing because blacks were more oppressed than they are today, leading to more cohesion of the in-group. But this doesn't actually mean anything for the topic we were discussing in the first place, anyways -- just because a mother has a husband means jack shit for their lifestyle; the guy may as well be an unemployed drunkard that just makes it worse and depends on whatever money the mother can scrounge together. That doesn't mean this is the case, obviously, but as an indicator this really doesn't say much.

&gt; Who knows where their interests are.

Just look at what they are doing, this isn't hard to find out. China has engaged in massive economical partnerships with Europe, in addition to major investments in Africa. If they are looking at conquest, it's going to happen in the form of corporate acquisitions. Military action would not only make no sense for their strategic interests, it'd risk destroying everything they spent the past decade to build up.

Russia, meanwhile, engages in political meddling behind the curtains, attempting to destabilize the US and the EU by fanning the flames of social unrest, funding political parties, or influencing elections. They do so because it's much cheaper and safer than conventional warfare, and because Russia considers the US hegemony a threat to its interests in the Middle East or Africa (e.g. Syria), where they seek to build partnerships with various dictators to help kickstart their own ailing economy. The EU, meanwhile, is in Russia's crosshairs probably chiefly due to the sanctions we've established. Breaking up the Union from within by supporting euroskeptic sentiments would diminish the EU's ability to extend protection to non-EU countries, and allow Russia to restore trade activities without compromising on its activities.

you are a goddam idiot if you think that.

I tried to stay in wars for the next eight years in order to prevent my vassals from declaring independence. After I managed to turn them all loyal again, I finally peaced out. Then, Nogai and Delhi supported my vassals' independence, while my potential allies were still tied up in the Ottoman crusade. So I bid my time, hoping they wouldn't declare. They declared.

This was a war I wasn't realistically going to win or even white peace out of. It was my four previous vassals (I managed to annex Fars before Delhi supported independence), Nogai and Delhi overrunning me all at once. But then, the ~~Winged~~ Muslim Hussars arrived. With outside help from both Arabia and India, I managed to peace out Delhi and Nogai and regained the lands of two of my previous vassals.

488,"Actually no. This emergency mechanism is build the way that one country (in this case Sweden) rises an emmergency alert via Brussells and others respond (Poland, Denmark, Germany,  France and dosen others in this case). The responding countries offer what they can depanding on what they have and what situation is there at particular moment ( in this case we could offer sending those trucks and firefighters because we had heavy rains in last 2 weeks and we don't have the drought situation here). Than the country which raised the alert accepts the offer (or says ""thank you guys,  but we need something different""). Than the offering country sends help and pays the costs. They also need to be able to take care of their own needs there (for example our figherfighters have tents with them for accomodation). 

I guess it is done this way because the emmergency can be different each time. There can be an actual cathaclism as well and the country that raised the alert can be in total shambles and simply wouldn't be able to offer housing to the rescuers much less pay them. If you offer help, you simply have to be able to provide it. This mechanism simply works this way. Imagine if it was a super rich Scandi country sending their figherfighters elsewhere. The costs would be enormous. The country in distress cannot worry of the costs on top of that. It would be tragic if someone did not ask for help because fearing that they wouldn't be able to pay.

489,"Meh I regularly have military vehicles do recon exercises around my house, often setting up an OP in a tree line somewhere or camouflaging a radar vehicle. Even though we live pretty far away from any military base, most people just seem to think our military are a bunch of boy scouts and ignore them completely.

People in Europe don't really take the military that seriously, and since the Germans kinda stopped doing invasions after '45, assuming any kind of invasion without big fireballs in the sky is simply not logically conceivable  to the average Dutchman.

More importantly, in the US the military is seen as a mighty force, possibly as an extension of the government. In Europe the military was almost always purely defensive in nature and made up of conscripts throughout the cold war. This means that again, the idea of the military being used to oppress their own citizens is inconceivable to western Europeans, because the military was the force of the people. The military also generally doesn't really have extensive special legal powers, value their reputation and enforce discipline; so to the public they're less threatening than a simple police officer.

Literally bollocks. The UK has wanted to leave the EU since we joined. Before Immigration was even an issue, the lisbon treaty for example has like 20%-30% support in the UK. We would have vetoed it if the government at the time gave a shit about democracy (it didn't, ignoring the call of 90% of the population for a referendum, because they knew it would fail). Even then, consider this: UK real wages have been falling since we signed the lisbon treaty, partly because of a large influx of immigrants (For the last 2 decades, net migrants into the UK have been around 200k a year, which is a lot.). People wanting the government to lower huge immigration isnt ""xenophobia"".

You went ahead and quoted a great block of text without comprehending it.  Let me highlight the important part.

\&gt; *shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal,**** taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union***. 

The withdrawal agreement \*must\* take into account the framework for the future relationship.  It is not independent of what will happen afterwards but intrinsically tied to it.  Whether or not a withdrawal agreement ever gets signed is inextricably linked to the agreement over what the future relationship will look like.  The UK won't sign up to a withdrawal agreement that grants the EU all sorts of concession without also knowing, in outline, what the EU will agree to in terms of trade.  If you think that phase three can't begin until phase 2 is concluded, you might want to consider why there is no actual agreement on the withdrawl agreement text yet but negotiations have already begun on phase 3.

There is no excuse for this. Its all well and good if he'd rather be turkish than german, many turks are perfectly fine and decent people. But its a whole different thing to want to be turkish but play for the german national team and to use this position to endorse an enemy of this nation.

534,"&gt; No, it's an inevitability of the incompatability of the EU and UK negotiating positions.

&gt; The EU will only agree to a deal which has no hard border with the RoI.

This is truly amazing. Now it's the EU's incomprehenisble fancy that there should be no hard border in Ireland, is it? it's not the Good Friday Agreement requiring that, it's those bastards in Brussels eh? such stubborn cunts that they want to preserve peace in Northern Ireland by upholding deals the UK itself signed...

&gt; The December agreement is not the withdrawal agreement. I'm not sure where you got that idea.

The December agreement concludes the first phase of negotiations of the withdrawal agreement. I'm not sure how you got any other idea, given that it explicitly says so.

&gt; Firstly, I voted remain and am a European federalist. It just so happens that I also have a brain.

Espousing Brexiteer fallacies is not much evidence of either claim.

&gt; what is fair and sensible is approaching the issue in a holistic manner

A meaningless turn of phrase that means ""ignore logic and please give us what we want otherwise we'll be sad"".

&gt; You don't know what to disentangle and what to retain entangled

We do know full well actually. The list of shared or exclusive competences of the EU is public, as is the list of its programmes and schemes. The Foreign Office, as unprepared as it was for the victory of Leave, was certainly more than capable of drawing up a list of things that the UK would need to leave.

&gt; Negotiation requires both sides to give and take to reach a compromise

So far the UK has made several insane demands and proposed no concessions. The EU has actually been waiting for the British government to make up its mind about the kind of Brexit it wants, so it'd be a bit hard to imagine which concessions the EU is supposed to make, given that its counterpart doesn't agree with itself about which kind of concessions it would want, beyond the insane (like ""please break up the Single Market, thanks"").

&gt; So I repeat: the EU's sequencing was entirely for the benefit of giving the EU greater negotiating power.

Due to being poorly integrated and muslim minorities from the Middle East in germany having a massively over proportional criminal footprint, seen to their relative share of the population. They are notorious for making trouble in school, being agressive and criminally active.

Now obviously this isn't a universal truth, and especially in regards to turks its not anywhere near the majority of them. but being the largest such group, they catch the heat for everyone else included.

In particular because they are so massively unwilling to integrate into german society. Which is by no means exclusively their fault, but thats why they get the hate. Its not completly undeserved.

&gt;We do know full well actually. The list of shared or exclusive competences of the EU is public, as is the list of its programmes and schemes. The Foreign Office, as unprepared as it was for the victory of Leave, was certainly more than capable of drawing up a list of things that the UK would need to leave.

You don't know what institutions/agreements you ""need"" to leave until you know what your future relationship with the EU will be. For example, it would be silly for the EU and UK to negotiate a load of exit provisions regarding the UK leaving various agencies, only for the parties to then agree a Norway-style deal that keeps the UK part of those same agencies. As I have said, the future UK-EU relationship is intrinsic to how much of the EU the UK can/will roll back, and therefore withdrawal provisions for those elements of the EU.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/90wb0n/brexit_no_divorce_payment_without_trade_deal_says/e2ug1y4/,Taure,1532287283

Also known as the Brexit Theory of Time-Travelling Contractual Terms: negotiate now, have your terms changed later. It's incredible the kind of stuff you lot will convince yourselves of to defend the fantasy of a successful Brexit only sabotaged by evil eurocrats.

&gt;  The UK won't sign up to a withdrawal agreement that grants the EU all sorts of concession without also knowing, in outline, what the EU will agree to in terms of trade.

The UK has already agreed to 3 such ""concessions"", which are not concessions at all but basic matters on which no uncertain outcome can be permitted even in the worst case scenario: Ireland, citizens' rights, ongoing financial obligations.

&gt; If you think that phase three can't begin until phase 2 is concluded, you might want to consider why there is no actual agreement on the withdrawl agreement text yet but negotiations have already begun on phase 3.

My god this is hilarious. Preliminary work on phase 3 negotiations has begun **precisely** because of the December 2017 agreement, which was supposed to create a basic agreed-to fallback about the most fundamental matters.

Please take some more classes in logic or English because you are failing to grasp either one or the other.

685,"No, it really wasn't. The main campaign ""Vote Leave"" didn't even discuss migration. It was all sovereignty and finally having a say on all the integration that occurred since they joined the EC which was sold to them as trade. Then of course also the spectre of future integration like a fiscal union or EU army.

The migration stuff was from the unofficial campaign called ""Leave.EU"" that had Farage and the like in. They argued that the way of life for the British had changed and could change in the future (using the migrant crisis at the high point as an indicator). It was an understandable (but unfortunate) card to play at the time, I know the largest polling party here in Sweden did the same, and it worked for them.

The UK is not very xenophobic by my standards, they have lots of people from all over the world there and did before the EU and will after. I can see some bitter antagonistic comments from the continent driving some of them in that direction as far as the continent goes, but that would be an unfortunate by-product.

696,"There is an important difference if there are unintended civilian casualities or if the purpose of a whole operation or doctrine is to kill as many people and destroy as many houses as possible.
While the official doctrine was the first, only a naive person would believe that.
In the case of late WW2 western allied area bombings the purpose was obviously the latter.

They even choose cities as bombing targets not on how important they are strategically but how easy it would be to ignite a firestorm.

The allies won the war anyway - and they won it on land.
Germany was in no position to ever win because they lacked oil, other natural ressources and manpower.

Precision of the bombers is a truly stupid apology.
Factories, power plants, military encampments, etc. are not usually located in the city centres.
But guess where the centres of bombing raids were? In the city centre.

It is in fact a good example of the difference between precision and accuracy.
If the bombings would have been accurate (with the intention to hit military and industry targets) but not precise, the centre of the bombing areas would still be around these military and industry targets, just with a large hit area.
But the bombings were neither precise (hitting a small area) nor ""accurate"" (assuming the intention was to hit military and industrial targets in the first place, which it wasn't).

Furthermore, smaller planes with higher precision existed and could have been fabricated in larger numbers (instead of strategic bombers) and used to hit factories, power plants, military encampments, etc.

697,"Facebook blocking nuditiy has nothing to do with American laws. Both when Facebook shuts down racist groups and when they block nuditiy, they are doing so due to private decisions. The only real regulation on those topics in the US is when broadcast over the air, hence why HBO (not broadcast OTA) has almost gratuitous nudity. 

You will also find that hate speech is not broadcast over the air in the US (notwithstanding Trumps calls to build a wall and restrict immigration). Within media types the US is pretty consistent. 

From what I can find most of these seems to be algorithm based, given that pictures of pets were also sometimes removed as containing nuditiy. There is also the concern of not allowing revenge porn to be posted, and the only way to practically do that is not allow any nude pictures.

Fact is that the 2012 act is specifically targeting Russia, because Magnitsky was tortured by Putin's henchmen and died in a Russian prison. Magnitsky was investigating corruption and illegal money laundering activities in Russia. Sanders didn't sign it.

The sanctions against Russia/Iran/North Korea had nothing to do with the Iran nuclear agreement but rather with Iran's development of ballistic missiles. Besides Sanders previously argued he would sign it but then backtracked.

Your link only mentions that Sanders released one tax return, the one from 2014 which also was just a summary and not the full return. Clinton released all previous 8 returns. She also released all 8 in 2008.

Whether Sanders was a willing participant in the collusion or not is yet to be seen. He must have known his fb ads were paid for by Russia. He was asked about this two months ago on some Vermont radio station and his answer was very suspicious.

859,"\&gt; There is however an agreement on the divorce bill. And it was agreed that the divorce bill issue would be settled before any trade deal negociation in order to make the two issues completely independant. 

No, you're quite wrong about that.  The EU announced that it was determined to separate the issues while the UK announced that it was unwilling to do so.  In the end the EU climbed down on the strict sequencing with the December Joint Agreement, which is why what you call 'the agreement on the divorce bill' is framed in explicitly conditional language.  It was not signed as an independent, finalised agreement separate from everything else but was framed on the front page with the caveat that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.

\&gt; You can add ""taking account of the framework etc."", but this passage is so vague it means really nothing important and is not relevant. 

It's has its vagaries, for sure, but it is perfectly clear on the key point that the withdrawal agreement is not something to be settled without reference to the future in a hermetically sealed manner and only then do we move on to discuss future relationships.  On the contrary, the withdrawal agreement must take into account the framework of the future relationship, which it cannot possible do if the two are completely separated.",,/r/europe/comments/90wb0n/brexit_no_divorce_payment_without_trade_deal_says/e2tvc2d/,Cryptoalt7,1532265181

1023,"&gt;They don't work with India so they're white supremacists

If Indian nationalists don't work together with European nationalists, does that make them Indian supremacists? Why should Europeans take the burden here? 

The reason is not white supremacy, but our commom history that we've shared for hundreds of years. India is remote and they weren't in contact with us until the British colonised them. We have less things in common and our problems in the near future differ way too much from theirs. India is about to become a superpower, while a Europe that's dominated by foreign powers is a likely outcome for us.

Actual white supremacy is demanding India to become a European colony again, simply ignoring them could be interpreted as live and let live. Somehow connecting indifference to supremacy is a really big reach.

E: the Traditionalist school of philosophy promotes perennialism which means that all the religions/ethnicities of the world stem from a one common root. Another popular idea is ethnopluralism which means that nations (both with states and without states) voluntarily separate themselves in order to guarantee the preservation and furtherance of their respective cultures (which obviously would entail, for example, a separate African-American ethnostate as well, as well as a free Tibet etc.)",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/90p82b/bannon_says_he_will_set_up_group_in_europe_to/e2to8h7/,vironian_,1532250496

1080,"&gt;Germany lost the Battle of Britain because of it
They had tge RAF on the grounf and defeated.

No they didn't. The RAF were stronger than ever, and the Luftwaffe weaker than ever, when they finally got permission to begin area bombing London.

Serviceable strength on 13 August, the day the Luftwaffe launched their attack proper:

Fighters (Bf 109 and 110) - 1042  
Spitfires and Hurricanes - 579

The Luftwaffe switched to bombing London on 7 September:

Fighters (Bf 109 and 110) - 770  
Spitfires and Hurricanes - 621

The Luftwaffe started July with a huge advantage over the RAF. By early September it had gone, the RAF had got stronger and the Luftwaffe weaker. 

&gt;Instead of finishing the airfield and factories of and ending the aie battle over britain they (Göhring i believe) ordered them to bomb the cities and the fighters should escort them

But they weren't close to finishing the airfields or factories. British fighter production was high, only Manston was unusable as a fighter base, and the number of British fighters destroyed on the ground was tiny. The Luftwaffe was losing. They wanted a single large battle over London because they could no longer provide enough escorts for multiple smaller raids on airfields and factories.

&gt;This gave the RAF time to reorganize, rebuild and win the battle of britain later in the air

They had already won the battle, they just didn't realise it. The Luftwaffe underestimated British production and RAF strength, grossly overestimated their own kills, and thought as a result the RAF was down to fewer than 300 fighters. The RAF overestimated German production and reserves, only slightly overestimated German losses, and thought as a result the Luftwaffe still had thousands more aircraft than they did. 

On the morning of 7th September, just before the attack on London started, Churchill's war cabinet received an intelligence briefing that stated the Luftwaffe still had 1,700 fighters and 3,300 bombers (actual numbers, including unserviceable aircraft, were 1,040 fighters and 1,465 bombers). It stated that the Luftwaffe was still struggling to adapt to temporary airfields and logistics problems, and when overcome the scale of attack would increase.

That intelligence failure is why the RAF thought they were losing, when in fact they had already won. The Luftwaffe had frittered away its advantage in July and August and was incapable of defeating the RAF.

As Stephen Bungay puts it in ""Most Dangerous Enemy"":

&gt;Knowing that their enemy was preparing to 'go down hill' would have been cold comfort to the Luftwaffe. They assumed the enemy had been doing that for some time. In fact they believed he ought to be at his last gasp. General Stapf had reported to Halder on 30 August that the British had lost 800 Hurricanes and Spitfires since 8 August out of a front-line strength of 915. Given Schmid's estimate of their production capacity of 200-300 a month, the British could therefore only have 3-400 left at the outside. After another week of pounding in September, they must indeed be down to their last 200 machines.
In fact, on the evening of 6 September, Fighter Command had over 750 serviceable fighters [inc reserves - my note] and 1,381 pilots available to it, about 950 of whom flew Spitfires or Hurricanes. It needed 1,588 pilots to be at full establishment, which is of course what Dowding wanted, so from his point of view he was 200 short. From the Luftwaffe's point of view, he had almost 200 more pilots and 150 more planes than he had had at the beginning of July when they set out to destroy him.

1084,"&gt;Barely any countries are very 'homogenous' except for a handful like Japan and the Koreas. Unless you think that skin colour alone = diversity, which is a flawed and ignorant assumption. Most African and Asian countries have an incredibly diverse number of ethnic groups and languages, all with their own cultures, which can help contribute to their instability. Culturally, a country like France will always be far more homogenous than the DRC, India or Papua New Guinea, regardless of how many immigrants they take in.

You're aware that Europe and European countries had diversity before you started to bring in detrimental immigration with the excuse of diversity?

You are aware, that those groups in all the mentioned places, exclude France, have had those groups and 'diversity' as long as Europe has had theirs without the mentioned detrimental immigration

First article:

&gt;it was observed that there were lower male (13%) than female (22%) contributions from Central Asia to Anatolia, with wide ranges of confidence intervals

And this is a non-peer reviewed, non published thesis, which is the highest contribution you can find- 13/22%. Most studies find lower than that, including the others you quoted. 

Second article:

Is about Armenians, not Turks, but only finds a small percentage of East Asian ancestry in Turks:

&gt;We compared patterns of admixture in Armenians to other regional populations and detected
signals of recent admixture in most other populations. For example, we find **7.9% (±0.4) East
Asian ancestry in Turks from admixture occurring** 800 (±170).

Third article:

&gt;We show that **the genetic variation of the contemporary Turkish population clusters with South European populations**, as expected, but also shows signatures of relatively recent contribution from ancestral East Asian populations.

Fourth article, which is basically saying Greek and Turkish Cypriots are the same:

&gt;Y-chromosomal analysis of Greek Cypriots reveals a primarily common pre-Ottoman paternal ancestry with Turkish Cypriots

&gt;Previous population genetic studies have identified that both Greek Cypriots (GCy)[10–13] and Turkish Cypriots (TCy)[14] show genetic affinity with surrounding Southeast European and particularly Near Eastern populations.

I invite you to read through this analysis of population projections in the past. Quote the summary:

"" 

o summarize the results for world projections  first, we note that the error in projected world population is small,  less than 1 percent (on average across various forecasts) in projections  as long as 20 years. The error seems to be larger, however, for  projections to the years 1995 and 2000. Projections to these years have  been consistently too high.

The explanation lies in fertility trends since  1990. World fertility declined sharply, around that date, at a faster  rate than in the previous decade. Four countries—China, Bangladesh,  India, and Russia —accounted for the largest part of this fertility  decline. While the decline might represent the start of a new era of  faster fertility decline, it could as well reflect highly particular  circumstances affecting these specific countries.""

The report itself directly acknowledges that these projections universally fail to take changing birthrates properly into account. This is why on a 20 years projection you already have a error margin of 1% (on this scale translating into millions of people), which becomes proportionally worse with every following year.

Thats why projections this far into the future are not useful.",,/r/europe/comments/90njqt/global_population_forecasts_how_the_world_will/e2tl4s1/,[deleted],1532243838

1162,"&gt;Your citations seem to back up exactly what I was claiming

They don't.

&gt;I am not claiming that Turks have zero Turkic/East Asian genetics,

Yes you are.

&gt;Obviously there was some transfer

significant transfer*

&gt;But those studies you cite say that Turks are primarily genetically related to European and Near East populations, and the East Asian contribution was relatively small.

Nope.

&gt;The weight for the migration event predicted to originate from the branch ancestral to East Asia (presumably Central Asia) into current-day Turkey was 0.217 (21.7%)

&gt;Although this implies a **major population event from the East to West Asia**, we note that these weights are not direct estimates of the migration rates. First, the original contributing populations to the ancestral population in Turkey are not known. For instance, we do not know the exact genetic relationship between current-day East Asian populations and the Turkic speakers from Central Asia who migrated into Anatolia about 1,000 years before present.

it says """"MAJOR POPULATION EVENT""""

Do not manipulate the study please thx.

&gt;For example, we find 7.9% (±0.4) East Asian ancestry in Turks from admixture occurring 800 (±170).

average of all the Turks in the study. And they were from Central Anatolia (behar samples) However if you checked the [PCA plot in the study](https://i.imgur.com/m5d9Po9.png) you'll see that many Turks score much more than that. 

8% or 9% seems to be average for Central Anatolian [as personal results also prove that](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-301b7cc3b36392aecc97c9bf625af636). However, in other parts of Anatolia this rate can go up to even to 18% or down to 3% like in Eastern Anatolian provinces.


Also check the last study's PCA plot.

https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2F1471-2164-15-963/MediaObjects/12864_2014_Article_6660_Fig2_HTML.jpg

This is obviously a racial pca plot as Turks also cluster with Northern Europeans and Castizos/Mestizos at the same time.

Turkish Cypriots are not same as Turks.

1163,"Tying your currency to the Euro doesn't account for the other effects that come with Euro status. For one thing, upon adoption of the euro, lending becomes easier and interest rates drop. This causes an expansion in the total money supply, driving inflation. 

Also, tying your currency to a foreign one necessitates holding massive amounts of foreign currency reserves, which actually limits inflation since the presence of foreign reserves on a bank's balance sheet [has almost no effect on inflation](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e3b7/4456e9c878d33600ed91ac5641e483c81a08.pdf). So intead of buying domestic assets with cash reserves (which would increase inflation), banks in countries with tethered currencies must spend their money on things which don't increase inflation (foreign currencies).

There's a pretty good reason why countries that suffer systemic inflation tend to tie their currencies to larger, more well-established ones (look at Argentina and Zimbabwe tying their currencies to USD to see this principle in action).",United States of America ,/r/europe/comments/90pcg3/romania_to_face_stricter_conditions_to_join/e2tlcq6/,Longlius,1532244272

Patriotism is usually associated with positive feelings about one's country. Nothing wrong with that. Nationalism has that too, but to a degree so unhealthy that people start to think their country is better, superior to others.

1228,"&gt; But the Turks are the original inhabitants, genetically. They are descended from the people who lived in those cultures. There was a cultural shift, but not a genetic one, the indigenous population was converted, not killed or displaced.

No. You're wrong and making everything up.

Science says:

[Article no 1](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2015/02/18/015396.full.pdf)

&gt;Previous genetic studies have generally used Turks as representatives of ancient Anatolians. Our results show that Turks are genetically shifted towards Central Asians, a pattern consistent with a history of mixture with populations from this region

[Article no 2](http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12607764/index.pdf)

&gt;Moreover, results pointed out that language (Turkish) in Anatolia might not have been replaced by the elites, but by a large group of people. Therefore, it can be concluded that the observations do not support the elite dominance model of Renfrew (1987 ; 1991).

[Article no 3](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179474)

&gt;it should be noted that modern Turks are a hybrid population, comprising of the original Anatolian stock, Turkic people (i.e. of Central Asian ancestry), as well as other ethnicities from regions comprising the former Ottoman Empire

[Article no 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4236450/)

&gt;The weight for the migration event predicted to originate from the branch ancestral to East Asia (presumably Central Asia) into current-day Turkey was 0.217 (21.7%)

And the study you posted was about Byzantine populations. Not Turks.

Not even talking about phenotype argument. I can also cherrypick.

I can't really bring myself to guilt over subjecting those who died to defend that regime to the same treatment, but I'll be generous and call it a wash. As for American looting of art during the war, since on the one hand it was standard Nazi policy to loot the shit out of their subjects' cultural treasures, and on the other hand there existed a division of the US Army whose sole purpose was to do the exact *opposite* of that, I feel like on balance we come off pretty good.

As for Allied war crimes, I explicitly admitted that they exist. I'd argue over the specifics of the atomic bombings and Dresden, but broadly I would agree with the statement that there were crimes committed by the Allies. I never said anything to the contrary.

What I *did* say really amounts to ""come on.""

Of course you can't negate one crime just because of the existence of a worse crime. But my point was meant to illustrate just how much worse the second crime is. Comparing the Holocaust - the actual Holocaust - to mishandling a historical artifact is essentially the equivalent of comparing decapitation to a leg falling asleep. I'd say a paper cut, except that actually draws blood.

Which feeds into my point: ""can"" you compare the two crimes? Well, yeah, no one's stopping you. But the crime you've chosen to compare one of the worst in history to, doesn't even involve a single incident of bodily harm to a person. Again - it's a soldier mishandling a historical artifact. And you're taking that, putting it next to the - say it with me - literal Holocaust, and saying ""well, the Allies did some bad things.""

So can you compare this picture to the Holocaust? Yes. But it would be quite possibly the most tone-deaf thing you could do.

That's because you tried to debate me in circles. My points are

1) The laws are unenforcible on foreign servers and news sites and

2) Banning content is ineffective as it can be avoided by VPN and has the Streisand Effect anyway

&gt;The vast majority of users, even in an oppressive country like China, will comply with the legislation in place.

How do you tell the difference between compliance and someone who doesn't seek something that is banned in the first place? It's like saying everybody that doesn't do narcotics avoids them because the of the laws, and not for other reasons, like preserving their health or simple disinterest.

&gt;The German Constitutional Court referred to a ""structural democratic deficit"" inherent in the construction of the European Union.[3] It found that the decision-making processes in the EU remained largely those of an international organisation, which would ordinarily be based on the principle of the equality of states and that the principle of equality of states and the principle of equality of citizens cannot be reconciled in a Staatenverbund.[3] In other words, in a supranational union or confederation (which is not a federal state) there is a problem of how to reconcile the principle of equality among nation states, which applies to international (intergovernmental) organisations, and the principle of equality among citizens, which applies within states.[4] ",French Mother & moving to France ,/r/europe/comments/90rx25/due_to_the_multiple_severe_forest_fires_we_have/e2td9mn/,Lafayette_is_daddy,1532231289

1426,"&gt;Maybe he could say that when the war hadnt been fought on his countrys soil.

Perhaps, you're right. Was it a lot easier to be nice only fighting 1 year and away from home soil? Yes infinitely so. That still doesn't change the fact that RIGHT after America intervened to ""save democracy,"" Europe managed to start another war 20 years later, dragging America into another war. So regardless, America was right. Even after getting home soil attacked in WW2, America still didn't go for the revenge route and in time Germany and Japan have prospered. Germany and Japan paid 0 reparations to USA

Ya wanna know the secret to European peace post ww2? 

If anyone says economic cooperation or the EU they're lying. USA forced the peace. CIA started funding the EU in 1950, Marshal Plan in 1950 contingent on economic cooperation.

1956 when Europe was intent on starting WW3 over colonial matters in the Suez Crisis. People conveniently forget that USSR was stamping over democracy in Eastern Europe with tanks all because UK and France decided to play colonies. 

USA financial support was contingent on Europe dropping all of their colonial empires, which in the long term was inevitable, a moral decision, and prevented further wars like the possible Suez Crisis. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956

 Once again hijacking our attempt to ensure Europe's future safety against the USSR over self interest. Let me repeat. No one cared that USSR was using tanks to suppress  democratic revolts because of the Suez Crisis.

What did America get out of it for taking this morally right stand?  France took it as an insult and kicked our troops out. A huge loss of international prestige and Hungarian people suffered.

So yes, Europe has dragged America into three wars. I would argue that to suggest the opposite is blasphemes.

1433,"&gt;There is no reason why Corbyn shouldn't go for a customs union with the EU

He objects to the EU's rules on state aid.

That's why he is making no attempt to stop No Deal Brexit. It takes the UK out of the EU completely in March 2019 without a transition. If it all goes badly he gets an early general election out of it and won't have to deal with any pesky EU rules if he does win.

&gt;Given the choice between a close alignment with Trump's America or with a social democrat Europe, he will chose the latter.

Corbyn has such a poor opinion of Europe, he wants the UK to exit NATO. He won't choose Europe just because he doesn't like America. He would rather reject both.

Especially as he doesn't see much of Europe as being social democrat at all - no-one would call Hungary, Poland, Austria etc ""social democrat"". They are right-wing populist countries.

1470,"&gt;Well of course the concept of ""European"" exists.  

Well yeah, the concept obviously exists, the concepts of dragons and unicorns and leprechauns and fairies also exist.  

&gt;It simply refers to the native European populations,  

This concept is just as fictional as fairies, considering how all Europeans came from Africa.  

&gt; the genetically distinct populations native to Europe  

You're just getting downright mythological at this point! There's no ""genetically distinct"" population at all, there's been constant interbreeding with people all over Africa and Asia, there are no distinct lines they are extremely blurred.  

Frankly, the entire concept of distinct races of humans is pretty much nonsense, there's hardly any scientific basis for it.  
If you really try then you can find a handful of genes that are fairly distinct, but at that point you're talking about such a minuscule portion of the human genome that there's really no point in placing as much value in it as people currently do.  
It should be an interesting bit of trivia, not one of the most controversial topics of human discourse.  

&gt;I don't see how or why you'd claim it doesn't exist.  

Then you're revealing your ignorance on the topic.

1535,"&gt; Gendered vocabulary is entirely engraved and central to most languages, it is impossible to remove in many cases, the whole idea that because you describe someone as a hostess or host is not a discrimination based on gender, it is just a descriptive word, providing more information than a general term.

Of course it's dsicrimination; you literally make a distinction based on gender.

Apart from that the idea that ""host"" is a male term is and always been bullshit and just a lie invented by people who want to create symmetry and cling to gendered words so they have an excuse to keep using it. In the earliest 1828 edition of Webster's dictionary a ""host"" was already defined as:  ""One who entertains another at his own house, without reward."" whereas hostess was defined as ""A female host; a woman who entertains guests at her house.""

This shit that there is a ""male"" and ""female"" term has been bullshit from the start; it's bullshit in English; it's bullshit in German; it's bullshit in Dutch; it's bullshit in French. There's a unisex and a female term and the unisex term has always been used for females as well; that the unisex term is ""male"" is just a lie invented by people who want an excuse to continue to use gendered language because their sexist little brain can't handle the fact that they don't know the gender of the person spoken about and they can't have their prejudices but they're too chicken too just admit ""I am really uncomfortable not knowing the gender of this person because now I don't now which way my prejudices should swing""

&gt; Is the information necessary, in most cases no, but in a few yes and this compacted word helps convey that information more efficiently and neatly. Anyway what would be the alternative, to adopt all the masculine words as the general term for both genders? Or adopt all feminine terms?

They _aren't_ masculine; that's a bullshit political lie and every descriptive dictionary on the matter agrees with that who base their definitions on actual use. There is always a unisex and a female term with the unisex term predating the female term and having a unisex history and the female term derived from the unisex term.

The term ""host"" has been used for females before the term ""hostess"" which was introduced only 300 years later even existed and has continued to be used by them and every descriptive dictionary will say the same thing.",Dat is allemaal helemaal niet nodig hoor.,/r/europe/comments/90ifc2/theresa_mays_brexit_proposals_died_in_brussels_in/e2szbs2/,Homoerotic_Theocracy,1532214652

He claims a variety of evidence suggests memories of this were preserved in later Irish tradition, and also makes an elaborate linguistic case.[35] According to his theory, the name of the legendary Fir Bolg (whom O'Rahilly identifies with the Érainn) is the Irish equivalent of Belgae. Fintan O'Toole suggested the Keshcarrigan Bowl represents evidence for the movement of people into Ireland following upheaval and displacement, triggered by the Belgae arriving into Britain as refugees from the Romans.[36]

1580,"Okay first of all let's get one thing straight - what's going on here is an American soldier messing around with the crown. Not a theft. If you're looking for theft, you'd be talking about the Nazis, *not* the Americans, who originally [removed the crown from its place in Vienna and brought it to Germany](https://www.lootedart.com/O93NM2220731). So your point is moot anyway, because the side that committed one of the world's greatest atrocities is the *very same side* that committed the theft that's supposed to very partially balance that out. Even if you want to quibble over whether the crown belonged in Vienna rather than Nuremberg, that doesn't change the fact that in this situation, the Americans acted as a neutral force by restoring the artifact to its prewar status.

And anyway, I'm not saying that the existence of a ""worst crime"" negates any more minor crimes that also exist. I'm simply saying that in this situation, it's completely tone-deaf to pull some ""let's not forget the crimes of the good guys"" when you have the literal *Holocaust* as a backdrop.

Alexandre Benalla was everywhere with the President. Looks like they have close relationship. He is the number 2 of E. Macron cabinet so there is no doubt the president personally chosed him, knowing his background and his methods on work and in his outside life.

More, the dude is not just taking advantage of his position to beat random protestors ; he was giving order to high ranked cops so they shut up and gave him the record of his behavior, he is wearing Police outfit and talking using Police channels, it is highly illegal for a civil.

More, he was offered a house and a luxurious cops' car by the President himself while E. Macron and his cabinet was aware of his acts during the protest and multiple other reports for unprofessional behavior.

More, the President didn't say a word in two days. E. Macron has an average 7 tweets per day while being President... and he didn't say a word in two days! The guy must know lots about the president.

More, the President majority in Parliament refuses to communicate. They prevent the opposition to lead an investigation and question the government. The Parliement's role include to keep an eye on the government and the President so they don't outright the law. Political opposition is roughly dismissed... they are ignoring the problem and urge to conclude their constitutional reform which will fortunately give more power to the President and lower the number of representatives... The saddest is that no deputy of the majority seems to realy care. They all obey and shut their mouth. We can see those people's true face: they are not political representatives of the Nation.

In america, race relations are quite troubling. Most logical people put the blame on obama. I can cite the percent of americans who thought race relations were good in 2007 and 2016. It has gone up dramatically. Obama used it as a political tool to bash his opponents.

Black families need 7 white families tax dollars to subsidize their stuff, healthcare and food stamps. Something like 10k a year is needed for black families. Immigrants also need more education funding than white and asians do. This an american problem reflected greatly in turkish and muslim enclaves in EU.

And by the way, my biggest contention with what you said is about america being somehow worse than any other country. Without america, the world would collapse. Russia could sweep the continent in a month. Medecine wont be developed. All the major western tech companies is in the US. China will not develop as much as they copy a lot from the US. 

For UBI, it doesnt work. Up until the 1960s black americans were the fastest growing income earners. Now it has gone down and stagnated. That was the result of federal money given to them in terms of large welfare checks.

1603,"&gt;So when Denmark was very ethnocentric in the past and had next to no immigration it had a steep population decline, right? Wrong. This is clownish from you.

...I'm sorry, are you trying to say Danes are having less children because of immigration?

&gt;Why would a Dane reproduce with an immigrant when Danes are the ones not having children?

They're having *less* children, not *no* children.

&gt;Moreover, the mixing of ethnic groups within these nations is next to nil.

Coming from someone who used to live in Copenhagen, I find that hard to believe. Do you have a source, or is this just something you're guessing from what you read on the news/online?

(This is where I joke about ""Oho well the Danes definitely wanted to mix with me!"")

&gt;Also, citizenship does not confer ethnic nationality. 

If someone has a long string of Danish ancestors stretching back centuries (such as when an ethnic Dane procreates with a foreigner), I'm pretty sure that makes them ethnically Danish.

...Also, what the crap does it matter what ethnicity they are?!

His point about the novelty in Christendom of practices which pre-existed in Islamdom is also well-taken - though one might add for further nuance that the universal status of European universities did not always extend to Jews, even after the 12th century (several Oxford colleges in the vicinity of Deadman’s Walk stand on the ruined homes and graveyards of banished Jewry), while teaching of certain texts was variously prohibited on theological grounds.

Most of migrants to Poland end up in the country in a legal way. Why wouldn't Poland accept them? This is certainly not the case for most of the migrants that end up in Italy.

A lot of work migrants spend only part of their time in Poland - they tend to go back home for prolonged periods, their families stay in Ukraine, and they don't intend to move to Poland permanently. Some do, but a lot of others don't. Again, compare it with the situation of the migrants from Afghanistan and Nigeria.

If we speak about Ukraine, most people fleeing the conflict zones - the actual refugees - tend to settle somewhere in Ukraine. If they move abroad, it's mostly to Russia, not Poland. The work migrants that go to Poland are mostly from the western and central Ukraine.

True, most people are lazy, selfish and scared of real competition.

&gt; It's a form of natural selection for me to keep people like you away from power.

Well I outlined two options for you in my previous reply. Either you have selective immigration with migrant quotas and only accept migrants that meet specific criteria. Otherwise the migrants will exploit the system and degrade your society.

Or the other option is to get rid of the artificial support systems and allow free competition in a free market, may the best humans win. 

I would argue that both systems can produce decent results. In a system of free competition you would most likely have more wealth produced overall and more freedom. But there is also more risk as you are responsible for yourself. In the other system you have a bigger state and less freedom, but also less risk because the government helps you in some ways.",,/r/europe/comments/90p82b/bannon_says_he_will_set_up_group_in_europe_to/e2stal1/,[deleted],1532207974

&gt;Among demands issued by the plotters towards the Allies were such points as re-establishment of Germany's 1914 boundaries with Belgium, France and Poland and no reparations. Plotters demands meant annexation to pre-1939 Germany of 70,000 square kilometers of non-German territory, especially the disputed Polish areas; it seems highly unlikely that the Allies would have accepted such enormous demands. Like most of the rest of German resistance, the July 20th plotters believed in the idea of Greater Germany and as condition for peace demanded that western allies recognize at minimum the Nazi annexations of Austria, Alsace- Sudetenland, and Polish territories, with even restoration of some of the overseas colonies. They believed that Europe should be controlled under German hegemony.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some like Friedrich-Werner Graf von der Schulenburg even wanted all of Poland annexed to Germany.  
&gt;  
&gt;Many members of the plot had helped the Nazis gain power and shared revisionist foreign policy goals pursued by Hitler, and even at the time of the plot were anti-democratic, hoping to replace Hitler with a conservative-authoritarian government, which would be ruled by elites.

* Federal 


* Flemish Region &amp; Community 


* Walloon Region


* Brussels Capital Region


* French-speaking Community (yes, this is seen as a different thing than the Walloon and Brussels region... it's complicated) 


* German-speaking Community (couple o' towns in the east of Belgium)


Media are separated (Flanders has VRT as a public broadcaster, the French speaking community has RTBF), so your average Willy or Mariette doesn't know a great deal about what goes on on the other side of the language border unless they have family there or work there. Politicians have also historically liked to use the Flanders vs. Wallonia conflict as a way to gain votes, although this has fortunately calmed down a lot since the late 2000s - early 2010s (although the focus for blame has shifted, unfortunately. why shit on Walloons when you can shit on muslims?). 


Normal people's attitudes vary a lot. Certain events do bring the country together, like the recent World Cup success of our national team, which is probably one of the more succesful things binding our country together (other such things are the monarchy, which has mixed reception; our shared love for beer, fries, and chocolate; and our mutual claim on Brussels).

I disagree. At least in theory, catching up is a lot easier. See South Korea, Singapore, China, or Botswana, to stay topical. Just get the institutions right, and a lot of growth happens quickly and reliably.

What's hard is getting them right. The reason most poor countries are poor is because theirs are terrible. No functional markets, no secure, certified property rights, tons of public and private corruption, social norms enshrining these things, civil wars, religious oppression, etc.

2014,"You have take in account the _positive_ effect of humans to the carrying capacity. Also known as technology. The carrying capacity argument has been out long, and even nazis used to use it in their arguments for lebensraum. With only the technology of 1900 we WOULD be in horrible state already. But we are not. Green revolution and other advances have increased the yields and efficiency of agriculture to levels impossible before. So basically the red line has been proven wrong by history.

Of course it very much possible, and I would say likely, that the total amount of arable land is going to decrease. But we have still SO MUCH to improve in efficiency. Especially in Africa. Much of the farming on the contient is still sustenance. Imagine what would happen if the area would have access and the infrastructure for same farming techonology as USA. That would be a game changer. And Africa IS becoming richer, slowly, but steadily. Watch at the growth rates of GDP and Chinese investments of many countries. Not all, but many. If they can repeat the process of China, it is not unimaginable to see they getting the infrastructure of capital needed.

Another thing is the advances in biotechology. There have been many advances in genetechnology (CRISPR to name one), which will help us to tailor the crops of ours to new challenges of climate change. Drought won't be as bad of an problem for them and they won't need as much protection against insects and diseases.

So in general, I lean to positive side in the end. It won't be easy, and it won't be certain, but I believe that the ingenuity of humanity will overcome the obstacles. We have technology and the resources to achieve it with more research being done around the world than ever before.

2061,"Behind the paywall:

RATHER than a war memorial, it is a monument to a victory. Francisco Franco, whose military rebellion against a turbulent parliamentary republic triggered the Spanish civil war and his 36-year dictatorship, conceived of the Valley of the Fallen as a place to pay tribute to those who died for what he called his “Crusade”. Erected over 19 years, using forced labour, it is designed to inspire fear rather than sorrow. Its massive cross on a rocky outcrop in the foothills of the Sierra de Guadarrama is visible from the outskirts of Madrid, and its basilica is a cold vault bored 250 metres into the mountainside. It contains the remains of 33,847 dead from both sides in the war. Only two graves, both in the basilica’s transept, are named: those of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, founder of Spain’s fascist party, and Franco himself.

In a vibrant democracy, the site has become an aberration. Last year parliament approved a resolution sponsored by the Socialists and supported by all parties except the conservative People’s Party (PP) and a Catalan party to move Franco’s remains, rebury Primo de Rivera in a less prominent place and “resignify” the Valley as a democratic memorial. Having unexpectedly ousted the PP from government by means of a censure motion in May, Pedro Sánchez, the new Socialist prime minister, is poised to act on the resolution. Franco’s remains will be exhumed “in a very short space of time”, he told parliament on July 17th.

Only a few diehard franquistas actively oppose Mr Sánchez’s decision. Several hundred of them staged a protest at the Valley recently. But the PP is discomfited by the issue. Many of its voters are over 60; they grew up in the latter decades of Franco’s rule which, while still repressive, saw growing economic prosperity and the creation of a middle class. And many families have forebears who were on opposing sides in the war.

“Our democracy will have symbols that unite citizens,” Mr Sánchez promised. That is a worthy aim. To achieve it, the Socialists should restrain their desire to set up a “Truth Commission” about a war that ended almost 80 years ago, or turn the Valley into a “museum of memory”, which will doubtless be the version imagined only by one side. Far better to make it a simple national war memorial, help those who still don’t know what happened to relatives killed in the war and repression, or where they are buried—and leave the rest to the historians.",,/r/europe/comments/90p682/spains_socialist_government_plans_to_exhume/e2s2hge/,Chukapu,1532178677

2067,"Behind the paywall:

THE new Brexit plan has crumpled on its first contact with reality. Faster than even we expected, Parliament has been seized by the idea that Theresa May might not be able to win a majority for a Brexit of any sort.

If nothing changes, the prime minister could break the jam in three ways: use crashing out of the European Union without a deal as a threat to get MPs to compromise; ask voters to elect a new Parliament that is up to the task; or, as the author Robert Harris says, hand “the screaming, defecating, vomiting baby back to its parents—the electorate” for a second referendum. All three have problems but, if Brexit must be unblocked, a referendum would be least bad.

Mrs May’s plan, imposed on her cabinet this month at Chequers, her official country house, set Britain on the path to a “soft” Brexit. If the EU agrees to it, the country would, in effect, stay in the single market for goods, though not services. It would pay heed to EU standards and court rulings. Until the government could devise a way of collecting tariffs without border checks, Britain would remain in a customs union.

This plan was supposed to rally Conservatives. Instead the party is at war with itself. This week hard-Brexiteers claimed to have wrecked the Chequers plan by getting Mrs May to accept amendments that contradict it. Whether they are right or not (Downing Street says not), it was a trial of strength and Mrs May lost. Alarmed Remainers then put up another amendment as a trial of strength of their own, which Mrs May won. Meanwhile, as those who think the Chequers plan is worse than what Britain has today call for a second referendum, members of the government are falling as fast as summer flies.

**Chequers mate**

Parliament will soon break for the holidays. If swimming, sangria and siestas fail to soothe MPs’ nerves, Mrs May will face defeat in the autumn, as EU negotiators wring out concessions that make the deal even less palatable to its critics. Without enough Tory support to get her plan through, she cannot pick up votes on the hard Brexit side without losing them from Remain, and vice versa. Labour contains plenty of MPs who support a soft Brexit, and a minority who favour a hard one. But the criticism heaped on the handful who backed Mrs May in votes this week shows how, as she totters, they will be pressed to withhold their support in order to trigger an election.

What if Mrs May tried to corral MPs by threatening them with a disastrous “no deal” exit? The prospect is ominous. New border checks would swamp customs. Trade would be hit with tariffs and non-tariff barriers. That would harm big export industries like drugs and chemicals, as well as carmakers, which send four of their every ten cars to the EU. Aeroplanes might be grounded, for lack of a safety regime. The City could not do business. Security co-operation with the EU would halt.

This is a dangerous strategy. For the threat to be effective, Mrs May must be able to convince voters that it really would inflict harm. Yet a poll this week found that 39% of them back a no-deal exit, twice as many as are for Chequers.

If the no-deal threat is reckless, what about an election? Going to the country is the time-honoured way to refresh governments. It is straightforward and relatively fast. Mrs May beat the Remainers this week by threatening a vote of confidence.

But an election might not settle the matter. When Mrs May called one last year, she was left with a minority government, fatally damaging her authority. That outcome could easily be repeated. An election would offer voters a choice between Mrs May’s warts-and-all compromise and a fantasy Labour Brexit that avoided all the hard choices the EU insists on. Polls give Labour a five-point lead. An election would mix up Brexit with everything else—health, the economy, defence and fear of the divisive leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn.

That leaves a referendum. In its favour, a new referendum is the purest way of overturning the old one or forcing Remainers to accept Brexit. But it would be hard to pull off. Unlike an election, a referendum requires legislation and could take months (see [article](https://www.economist.com/news/21746226-parliamentary-deadlock-means-it-may-be-necessary-go-back-people-second-brexit)). A simple, binary choice would be clearer than one MP’s suggestion of a three-way one. The alternatives should be between staying in the EU and the plan that emerges from negotiations with the European Commission. For this to be credible, the EU would have to agree that Brexit could be reversed. Unlike the chimeras of the first referendum campaign, the choice facing voters could at least be costed and debated.

Be in no doubt, a referendum is a desperate remedy. No matter that Brexiteers deserve most of the blame for failing to come up with a plan that could win the assent of the EU and the trust of the country. They will inevitably see a referendum as a betrayal, depicting it as a stitch-up in which Mrs May first neutered Brexit and then schemed to give Remainers a second chance. Even as a last resort, a referendum would thus leave Britain divided and unhappy.

2234,"&gt;Chinese historians count dynasties by using the ruling family, so if you divided Roman history the way you divide Chinese history, there would be a crap ton of short lived dynasties and would not be as continuous as China

The difference is that a dynastic change in China would often be much more chaotic than in Rome. The transition from the Tang to the Song for example took seveeral years and had a period of warring states in between. Sure many of the institutions of the Tang remained under the Song, but the state was no longer the same. The Tang had collapsed and out of it rose the Song.

This did not happen during a dynastic change in Rome. When a Imperial candidate tried usurping the Roman throne there wasn't a warring states period. The usurper would usually get the support of the army, march to wherever the Emperor was and kill/imprison him. The Roman state did not collapse because of this, it remained unchanged whenever this happened.
 
The only time it got close to happening was during the Crisis of the 3rd Century, that is if the Gallic or Palmyrene Empires had succeeded. But they didn't and the original Roman state beat them. 

&gt;Also, China was only completely conquered by non natives twice, the Mongols and the Manchus. Ironically, they are both completely assimilated into Chinese society

The barbarians that conquered the Western Roman Empire also assimilated into Roman society (What language family is Italy, Frnace, Spain and Portugal in? What religion do they follow?). The difference between China and Rome in this case is that the Mongols and Manchus conquered ALL of China. The native dynasty they replaced was completely eradicated from the map.

But the Germanic Barbarians did not conquer all of Rome. They never managed to conquer the Eastern Empire, and they even payed lip service to them for a while. The Germanic invasions are more comparable to the invasion of the Jin Dynasty than the Yuan or Qing.

2354," \&gt;  I can criticize Russian involvement in Ukraine but also say that the Nord Stream pipeline may be beneficial 

That's because you pretend to not know what meaning kremlin mouthpieces put behind NS 2.

In 2014 kremlin not just occupied Crimea: it started a full scale operation to disintegrate Ukraine as a country. Agents were sent to Kharkiv, Odessa, Dnepr, Donetsk and Lugansk to capture government buildings. Collaborators were recruited in advance to assist them: in Kharkiv ""fight club Oplot"" existed for over a year before the events and it's participants were trained to beat the shit from whoever doesn't support People's Republic of Kharkov and secession to Russia.

Another part of it was wave of dehumanizing propaganda designated to both split Ukraine and create opinion about Ukrainians as subhuman in Russia.

Part of it was ""we'll turn off gas and hohols will freeze to death in winter"" campaign. Which would sound like bullshit if gazprom wouldn't try doing exactly that. [See this girl?](http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/frankensstein/19869639/291764/291764_800.jpg) Poster says ""gas holodomor to banderlogi"" and this girl is not random nutjob but employee of Putin's pet NOD organization. She shown up at Trump and LePen campaigns and almost any other important shit kremlin propaganda participated in. So this is official position of kremlin. Other media don't even pretend that Ukraine isn't an enemy state to them and locking down transit isn't their priority.

Stockholm court ruled out that was severe breach of contract and gazprom now owes naftogaz money.

But there was a problem: most part of EU transit goes through Ukraine. And if Ukraine lacks gas to point of some towns not getting heating in winter it will just tap reserves even if those reserves are already sold to EU.

So, kremlin was pushing for South stream, Turkish stream and now RS2 with it's pet media outright stating to simple Russians that denying Ukraine profit from transit and preferrably causing damage to economy is very good for Russia as Ukraine is fascist neo-nazi enemy state.

EU supporting this shit is pretty much 1937th Munich Agreement. You there guys must remember what came next. 

And those discussions about ""what would happen if green men pop up in Baltics"" will become much less theoretic if Ukraine falls. There's even more: Putin already uses occupied regions of Ukraine and fact that there are zero jobs there as a source of cheap manpower in Syria. If he gets more land there will be more Wagner PMCs ready to screw you by Putin's order without even being Russian citizen.",,/r/europe/comments/90n8gw/why_is_everyone_who_doesnt_disagree_with/e2rs9s5/,TheCornOverlord,1532157695
2355,"You're downvoted but what you say is true. There has been boom of Russians coming here to live. [Here's an article](https://bivol.bg/russians-residence-permits-bulgaria.html) about it that says for example that in 2017 the permits for temporary residence have increased 3 fold and there are a total of 70 000 Russian who can live here, which is a lot for a 7 mil country.       

The language and culture are more similar than usual. The rule of law and freedom are better in Bulgaria as can be seen in various corruption and freedom indices.     

A lot of the Russian GDP is the oil and gas sector which while beneficial for citizens is still a very exclusive sector so it's not as beneficial as an equivalent amount of GDP from manufacturing or services. Thus despite a sizeable lead in GDP per capita for Russis, [living standards](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=Bulgaria&amp;country2=Russia) seem pretty similar and growing faster in Bulgaria.

Since HDI is one third GDP PPP per capita, Russia would get an edge there because of oil. However the distance is still small [(0.804 RUS to 0.794 BG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index) and since the latest date is only from 2015 things may have flipped since then.

I read enough.

&gt;Being either nationalist or communist is equally terrible

The communists, for all the shit that KKE is today, nonetheless liberated Greece from the Nazis in WW2, and despite the bullshit revisionism that has been rammed into the heads of people, was *the* most popular force in the country, uniting even non-communists in their project. 

The nationalists by contrast gave you 1923 and ended the 3000 year Greek presence in Asia Minor.

The fascists in turn gifted you the network of clientelist/corrupt state apparatuses which we know and love to this day.  They also gave you 1967 and the Cyprus debacle.  In some cases, [the very same dirty fascist bastards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgios_Grivas) were responsible for both the right-wing governments of ""democratic"" Greece post-WW2, *and* for Cyprus.

So your little false-equivalency experiment is just high-minded-sounding bullshit in reality.

&gt;Putting fascist labels on anyone that doesn't share what you consider to be 'right' or 'left' is not an argument.

I put labels where they belong.  New Democracy is sort of like the PP of Spain - remnant of Franco's regime - but of Greece.  Many of the ""moderate"" remnants of the junta/post-war regimes reconstituted themselves into a new ""respectable"" label after the metapolitefsi.

2402,"Most of these issue stem from Germany naming its country after a shared language.  Giving rise to a new meaning of the term German. In medieval times German referred to inhabitants of the HRE who spoke a Germanic language, which, I believe, sometimes referred to Dutch as well since the different dialects of German could sometimes be only 40% mutually understandable.  Austria speaking German makes it sound like they are speaking Germany's language but it is just as much Austria language. Germany calling its self Germany, meaning the ""land of the Germans"" was inaccurate because that phrase includes Austria and Switzerland. So in modern times German simply means Citizen of Germany as opposed to citizen of HRE. 

 Teutonic order for instance  was actually administered by Austrians, and since they weren't the ones doing all the crusading, they relied on mercenaries, and even tho most came from the HRE some came from Britannia France and even Poland.  Dont mean to upset any nationalists, its just that The identity of Central European states is really a complex and fascinating topic.  

TLDR : Germany naming itself Germany  is because of its ambition to unite all the HRE states but since they failed to unite all they created an incomplete meaning of the name and still got to appropriate majority of the HRE legacy.

USSR had that intel through the spy Network and they offered even before the war to station quarter of a million red army troops along the German border, with a promise to double the commitment should a war break out. 

Western Allies refused as they did not see Hitler as a serious threat, as Hitler was down with capitalism and Soviet Union was not, the wealthy classes feared for their money and instead forfeited everything. 

Now, it is obvious as to why they were wary of an offer from Stalin, I would be too. But they were not simply exercising justifiable due diligence. They hoped, like craven rats to sell everyone East of them to the Devil. Czechoslovakia, Poland, Balkans, Greece (help was sent to Greece in fact, but woefully lacking what would constitute the help as expected by Greece due to the defensive pact it had with the UK). And of course, they also hoped to bait USSR and Germany to tear each other apart, except they did not do enough to safeguard themselves in the process of waiting for Hitler to strike USSR. 

The best defence in a modern, mechanised war is a brisk and overwhelming offence. Germans revelled in offensive operations, Michael Offensive maneouvre in the Great War displayed that clearly. Defence is hard, it isn't like the Franco Prussian war where armies still had their main forces meet at set piece, almost remiscient of Napoleonic battles. In WWII front was continuous and manpower usage higher than ever. Attacks would come everywhere probing and then great spearheads where there was weakness.

Brits and French fucked up royally and they knew it too, the generals who knew what was up. They surrendered the initiative to the Germans without a fight, they started a war with a loser's mindset.

Hard to talk about white supremacy in this country, where, recent immigrant emergencies aside, people are predominantly from the same ethnicity and nowhere near the *melting pot* you can find in the US, or the UK.

2481,"Complicated, it depends. Most Ukrainians not from the western part of Ukraine generally like Russians, or are ok with them. I mean, obviously the war strained that, but there is some degree of hope that after Putin things will return to normal. Ukraine fought with Russia all throughout history, it doesn't mean we hate each other. Ukrainians still watch Russian TV, still see Russian movies, listen to Russian music and though less so, use Russian products. The language is interchangeable, I lived in Ukraine as a Russian speaker and felt more at home than Ukrainian speakers, and I was from Chernovtsi. 

Serbs definitely like Russians. Bulgarians seem to as well, I've met a lot. Hungarians are split, but the right-wingers like Russia. Greeks don't have strong opinions, from my vacations there they at least pretend to like us, if nothing else, since we bring tourist money. Many Moldovans like Russia, but mostly older ones. A lot of older people all across former USSR and Warsaw Pact countries pine for the stability and good healthcare/pensions of the USSR. Young or middle aged people however recognise the lack of opportunity and the debilitating corruption and stagnation of communism. 

Central Asia generally loved the USSR because they got massive amounts of cash, more so than they ever paid in. To be fair, most nations got a net increase in funds during the USSR, as Russia was the most developed. One of the key reasons USSR broke up was that the Party bigwigs in Russia realised it was a lot more profitable to rob just Russia alone instead of pretending to care about other nations. Ukraine was very strategically valuable and full of resources to the brim, but it nonetheless still managed to draw money rather than contribute, despite the mind-boggling amount of development Russia invested into it -- and hell, most of Eastern Ukraine was gifted to Ukraine as it used to be called Novorossiya (yeah, sound familiar?). It was a Russian land, but Lenin gave it to Ukraine. Officially Russia doesn't want it back. Who knows what Putin thinks -- but at the very least, the industry there is decaying so I doubt it's that valuable to Putin, not like Crimea. 

 Compare this to the Baltic republics, who depsite Putin's propaganda of ""they should be grateful for Soviet investment"" (yeah yeah I know lol) but statistics prove that the Balts were rather unique in being net contributors, as they were already educated and urbanised, with a higher living standard than the rest of Soviet Republics at the start of their life as SSRs.",Apparently Serbia according to /u/cLnYze19N,/r/europe/comments/909mqp/positive_feelings_on_people_from_outside_of_eu/e2rpcwz/,Aemilius_Paulus,1532152434

2638,"Well let's look at the actual text of the legislation (pulling from Wikipedia because it's the first English translation I could find):

&gt;**§ 130 Incitement to hatred (1985, Revised 1992, 2002, 2005, 2015)**[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial#cite_note-BRJGCC-33)[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial#cite_note-BRJSGB-34)   
(1) Whosoever, in a manner capable of disturbing the public peace:    
1. incites hatred against a national, racial, religious group or a  group defined by their ethnic origins, against segments of the  population or individuals because of their belonging to one of the  aforementioned groups or segments of the population or calls for violent  or arbitrary measures against them; or  
2. assaults the human dignity of others by insulting, maliciously  maligning an aforementioned group, segments of the population or  individuals because of their belonging to one of the aforementioned  groups or segments of the population, or defaming segments of the  population, shall be liable to imprisonment from three months to five years.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial#cite_note-BRJGCC-33)[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial#cite_note-BRJSGB-34)   
\[…\]   
(3) Whosoever publicly or in a meeting approves of, denies or  downplays an act committed under the rule of National Socialism of the  kind indicated in section 6 (1) of the Code of International Criminal  Law, in a manner capable of disturbing the public peace shall be liable  to imprisonment not exceeding five years or a fine.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial#cite_note-BRJGCC-33)[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial#cite_note-BRJSGB-34)   
(4) Whosoever publicly or in a meeting disturbs the public peace  in a manner that violates the dignity of the victims by approving of,  glorifying, or justifying National Socialist rule of arbitrary force  shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding three years or a fine.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial#cite_note-BRJGCC-33)[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial#cite_note-BRJSGB-34)  

Sections 1 or 2 are pretty common in most western countries, even those with ""freedom of speech"" (USA). So let's look at sections 3 and 4.

Section 3 states that you can't approve, deny, or downplay an act done by nazis *in a manner capable of disturbing the public peace*. If you're not disturbing the public peace, you're not doing anything wrong. You can believe that the holocaust didn't happen all you want, you can just disturb the peace by propagating your denial. I feel that's reasonable. Section 4 has similar verbiage.

As to why this legislation has been created for Nazis and not for William the Conqueror? Well Nazi Germany is something still very fresh in the mind of lots of people, and has a lot of first-order consequences in the world today. 

The reasoning behind this legislation is that, in Germany, denying the holocaust is considered to be an incitement of hatred against a part of their population (Specifically German Jews and other groups exterminated in the holocaust). Germany already has laws on the books about inciting hatred to a group of people, and this is just an extension of that which came around because of its prevalence following the war.","French citizen, living in the US",/r/europe/comments/90e6co/facebook_must_adhere_to_german_holocaust_denial/e2rca25/,rootusercyclone,1532135804

Also, check the WaPo website rn. All the stories are anti trump.

About the military industrial complex, any military spends a ton of money. Literally any government spends a ton of money on ideas. Investment in ideas doesnt guarantee their success. So, i dont think the military spends it that well and i think they should try to cut down. 

EU spends less than 2% of gdp and considering they are same in gdp as US. Thats more than 3x less. They dont spend all that much but they have a ton of countries which is why spending is higher.

Trump said after Charlottesvill, ""there are fine people on both sides,on both sides."" The outrage is a PERFECT example of media bias. The alt right is much better than antifa by any objective measures. The alt right is not violent, doesnt riot and causes no property damages. Its just that they are construed to be Hitler and Co. But they are still slammed over and over. I dont agree with the alt right but its clear as day they are treated like garbage.

And about america spensing on welfare and social services, the US spends 70% of the budget on welfare/food stamps/pension. The US cant function as a welfare state. The wealth in america is larvely created by the rich and the .001%. The average American is really much more lazy and mentally deficient than the social democratic paradises of sweden denmark and norway. The amount of welfare recipients(mostly the black and mexican population) leeches on welfare while paying no taxes. The country will collapse if we spend any more. The deficit is exploding off of left wing guarantees of pension, free healthcare and college. You should be worried about the us currency being downgraded, not spending less on welfare.


On UBI, the government is gonna collapse if money is gonna stop being lent to the government. On federal jobs grant, the government is going to collapse from the pensions that need to be paid. The pension unpaid amount is 4trillion. Do we need that any higher? You yourself say government is wasteful in the face of big money. Unions will pay leaders to support public sector unions in an ever ending loop of waste and corruption. Without the us you can kisa goodbye to the world order.

2689,"Thing is, when someone is moving to a new culture they start to diverge from their old culture whether they like it or not. Many people in the USA have diverged so much culturally from their roots that they can consider themselves having created a new and completely different culture. Or that the culture they came from have changed a lot while the emigrants keeps the old traditions. I mean, Im Swedish and there were about a million or so Swedes emigrating to USA in the late 1800s and early 1900s and if you ask their kids or grandkids about their religion they would most likely say Lutheran (or some other form of Protestant Christianity) because back then people were very religious. Modern Swedes today are however very much atheists so no matter how much the emigrants tried to hold on to their cultural heritage they still failed. I think you need to live in a certain culture to be a part of it, if you try to be a part of it from a distance you will eventually lose that culture anyway because it is not a static thing.

2699,"You really do not know if more countries will join the fight. Poland knows that should Ukraine fall the next war will be in Poland. Should Russia lose it will be the end of the country as we know it. Most likely broken down into smaller countries. It is a huge gamble for Russia to gamble its very existence.

They are not fighting soft westerners in Ukraine, they are fighting people more willing to die for their country than Russians themselves. So Russians families have to be ready to see their children come back in coffins by the thousands. Can they take the pain? Will they revolt in anger against the oligarchs? Who knows.

The West can deliver heavy weaponry and anti air missiles. It is really the bankruptcy of the Russian government and they will find that all their neighbours take advantage of Russian weakness to join NATO. 

Russia of today is just a raw materials exporter of a commodity not needed in the future, with aging population and without capital to invest on new technologies. Every year that the GDP of EU grows faster than Russia the power gap widens, like in the last 4 years.

I do not think that Russia is weak, but they are challenging the countries with the most bloody history on the planet. Only Germany alone was a huge challenge for the USSR. The Russia of today has simply no chance to win and its citizens will be kept poor for tens of years until they learn to not invade it's neighbours. All the West is bulling more and more weapons and the national reserves fade away, their window of opportunity is closing.

Other early pole vaulting competitions where height was measured took place at the Ulverston Football and Cricket Club, Lancashire, north of the sands (now Cumbria) in 1843. Modern competition began around 1850 in Germany, when pole vaulting was added to the exercises of the Turner gymnastic clubs by Johann C. F. GutsMuths and Friedrich L. Jahn.

If you mean classical liberalism (i.e. what Europeans generally understand as ""liberal"", being laisser-faire, capitalism, low state interventionism, low tax etc., see ALDE), then those ideas are opposed mostly by the socialist / left-wing parties, i.e. S&amp;D, GUE-NGL and arguably Greens-EFA.

If you mean modern social liberalism (i.e. what Americans generally understand as ""liberal"", being mixed economy, higher state intervention, more personal freedoms f. ex. in cannabis, equal rights for all, including women and gay rights etc.) then those ideas are opposed mostly by the conservative / christian / right-wing parties, i.e.  EPP, ACRE, ECPM, as well as partially by classical liberal parties, see ALDE (due to the opposition against more state intevention &amp; higher taxes).

That’s debatable.

Websites have been held responsible for user generated content for ages and are expected to differentiate jurisdictions in what they serve. That doesn’t change merely because they style themselves “social media”.

For instance, a few years ago the black French players took a photo together. Subsequently, it rained criticism they were excluding the other players.  
And in the Soviet Union the term for racism was practically only used as a synonym for chauvinism as the phenotypical differences among the minorities were too trivial.

Race is indeed an involuntary social construct stemming from discrimination in society, but the latter is not based on reason or logic. So you can't just ask people to ignore it, when they're judging for no good reason in the first place.

So it is one's awareness, perception and experience of the rest of the world, and one's one identity in it, what leads to an inclusive and empathic character.

German guilt is seeping through your comment, are you the grandson of Hitler, Hilmmler, Goebbels, Goering or any other high ranking nazi who are actually responsible for the holocaust? Probably not.
 Those fuckers had their punishment for their crimes why should you pay for them? If you want to sure you can but why would you enforce it on the rest of the germans.

&gt;Why do we  as the sovereign of Germany, the german people not hold the right to dictate what is accesible in germany and what is not

 You do, you can ban facebook from germany, what you cant do is dictate what a foreign company can and cant do on a platform not visible in the physical world. If facebook is to listen to all countries demands of their laws, then you are fucked because:
 -In switzerland armenian genocide denial is illegal
 -The french supreme court has curbed 2 such laws claiming they violate freedom of speech
 -If facebook would ban the armenian genocide denial then they would infringe upon the freedom of speech by the laws of france and if they didnt it would be a crime in switzerland
How do you solve conflicting laws. On another note gay propaganda (basically anything gay-related is banned in russia) should facebook ban all those gay pride parade photos?

&gt;what purpose does denying the holocaust serve?

The same as not denying it: it means you can have an opinion an express it even if that opinion is right or wrong

&gt;why do we have to accept the hate speech of the few which only serves to attack the dignity of others

Hate speech doesnt exist if you get offended by words on facebook you can just close facebook.

No, ""hate speech"" doesnt incite violence, if anything it prevents it. You see its hate that makes people violent. A person can kill a jew or a black guy or a gypsy or any group he hates without saying it, giving that person the right to speak attracts attention to said person and to his intention. If a black guy hears someone say ""I WANT TO KILL N***ERS"" chances are he'll keep some distance from that person.

2989,"&gt;What do we gain from tolerating, say, minorities getting bullied?

Yes, but this type of censorship also lead to that we can for example NOT discuss the problems with very high criminality and high society cost and low productivity of Gypsy populations. If we can't discuss it and discuss solutions how can we then do anything about it? Is it fair that ethnic Bulgarians or ethnic Romanians get bad reputation in Sweden because Swedish media always censor their reports about criminal Gypsies from these countries as ""Romanian  or Bulgarian""?

Same with the discussion about the Mohammedan ideology. and why can we freely discuss and ""bullying"" the Nazism ideology but not the Mohammedan?  why haven't we applied the same to Nazism? Because ITS NECESSARY to have free speech even if some Nazis supporters will be hurt; otherwise we do risk that uninformed people will be drawn to destructive ideologies and in the worst case win influence.

I am sure some political correct ""Mohammedan murder deniers"" will  say that you can't compare National Socialist with Mohammedanism. But if we can't have an uncensored discussion and debate how can people get informed views to even compare these ideologies?

I am against Censorship generally and the only limitation of free speech for me is a very narrow interpretation of  [incitement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incitement).  Example an mafia boss calling for killing a person,  promoting followers to make illegal activities, like murder, theft or any type of illegal harassment against person or persons.

Ottoman settlement policy: Turks stop being nomadic. Or else you'll be deported.

""the undesirables"" are usually the nomadic Turkmens and/or the Karamanids from Central Anatolia. Ottomans sent these people to Bulgaria and Greece as well.

When Ottomans captured Cyprus Nicosia was sacked. 20.000 people died. You sound like Ottomans killed every native there. Also when Ottomans captured Cyprus it was ruled by Venetians. Not Greeks.

3062,"&gt; Like literally any normal country in the world does.

Actually like no country in the world do. The whole idea of good and bad immigrant is as old as racism and doesnt reflect any reality at all.

First, The UK need mostly low skilled immigrants for its farm and other jobs that britons dont want to do. So the idea of only picking up highly skilled is stupid. 

Secondly, most immigration in most multicultural countries as the UK is, comes from familly members being re-united or by britons marrying immigrant from wherever. Again, you dont get ""good"" or ""bad"" immigrants, you get britons and their familly.

Finnaly, The UK could have use its EU migration brakes and/or could lower immigration from outside of the EU if there is really too many people comming in. But the UK has almost full employment and is actually in shortage in many areas, as nurses, fruit/veggie pickers, doctors and probably other jobs.

&gt;Every country with a large population is going to leapfrog us eventually in terms of raw GDP, what of it?

Well, you were part of the number 1/2 or 3 economical block, depending on the criterias chosen. Your voice was heard on internationnal stage, you will most likely lose that. The loneliness of the UK at the UN is already showing up and being costly to the UK.

&gt; It is more important to preserve our living standards and not participate in a race to the bottom for wages.

The whole idea of the Brexit is to remove tarrifs, protectionsm subsidies and regulations to the UK and make it ''global''. It is precisely a race to the bottom for the British workers as they'll have to compete with indians, chineeses and muricans workers but without the subsidies nor the protectionnism.

3102,"He does appear to be suggesting overflights, it depends on what he actually meant. On the one hand the UK would have rights to overfly any country that has signed up to the Chicago Convention (like Ireland), on the other hand planes that overfly other countries have to be deemed to be safe. If the UK leaves without any deal, it's aircraft safety certs wouldn't be recognised any more. That's my understanding of what people are worried about anyway. 


&gt;    The situation at the moment is that the United Kingdom is part of the Single European Sky, and if they leave the EU they are not. And that does mean that if there was a no-deal ‘hard Brexit’ next March, the planes would not fly, and Britain would be an island – in many ways – and that is something that they need to think about.

He was again asked if there were plans to avoid this.

&gt;    Our plan is to negotiate a withdrawal agreement that provides for a transition, but there can only be a withdrawal agreement if there is a backstop, and our position is to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement with the UK and an aviation agreement with the UK.

 ...

&gt;    But ultimately it is the UK that has decided to leave the EU [and] decided to leave the Single European Sky. And if they want their planes to fly over our sky, they would need to take that into account. You can not have your cake and eat it.

Out of curiosity, how would you solve this? On one hand, I think centralised processing centres in border states make sense, if they receive adequate support/funding from the EU. Perhaps it's just the Dublin Transfers that should be abolished, as it's just too much trouble for everyone to shuttle applicants back and forth, including the applicant themselves?

Just maintain a central register so that an applicant can only enter the system once. And maybe add a clause that makes granting asylum less likely if an applicant deliberately seeks to circumvent the intended registry at the Country of Entry, to discourage it.

Plus, of course there would have to be a system of checks to make sure no Member State deliberately tries to ""smuggle"" applicants into another country to dodge its obligations. Not saying Latvia would do this; I'm thinking more about Hungary here.

&gt; If feeling good about themselves is so important then they can have all of them.

That's exactly what Germany did with the Syrians and yet this was supposedly wrong as well.

3160,"&gt;I'd sort of agree with that if I didn't see Trevor's response, where he - in a non-comedy speech - basically said ""I don't think they're not French, but they're definitely African because of their ancestry"".

Well I don't think a response on the show was warranted, but I understand the impetus to respond.

And while the French vs American outlook on nationality is not to be ignored, nothing Trevor said is technically incorrect but by the same token his viewpoint is a bit myopic as one could *technically* say the entire French team are ""definitely African because of their ancestry"" since all of humanity spawned from there.

&gt;They're clearly presenting themselves as accurate.

I think that's part of the gag though. It's a mockery of 24 hour news anchors who present themselves in this manner.

The difference being, comedians should be allowed to flaunt the truth in order to get a laugh as their main goal is getting a laugh while newsanchors should not flaunt the truth to garner viewership but that is what a lot of them end up doing.

It's not like I didn't address that in my comment.

&gt; Also under the EU agreement airlines get far more rights than any other air agreement. As it is UK airlines can fly flights between any EU country. In this context having those rights be negotiated as part of a wider agreement, which could include fishing, isn't unreasonable. 

If the UK wants to maintain the rights it currently enjoys as pat of the EU single sky then it needs to be as part of a negotiation that includes other areas.

What I mean is that if the supplier for the UK company depends to much on that client they would try to make some kind of deal  so new tariffs don't end the business. If a new deal isn't possible there is usually another supplier that would take the production, the same happens if the supplier is located in the UK and the other and works with EU companies. There are a lot of things that could happen but from my experience companies just want to keep making long term businesses rather than o a lot of money so on a general level slightly increments in tariffs won't affect most of the industries. You can also argument that a decrease in GDP will mean a loss in jobs and a closure for some companies but if you take on a macro level a 3 or 4 % is just a couple of tenths of thousands of people from  populations of a couple of millions that would have to send new CV and will reincorporarse to the workplace as the new environment adjust to the new reality.

These policies included the imposition of an official ideology that stated that Moldavan and Romanian are two different languages, despite the fact that it is now agreed that “people in Moldova speak the same language as the citizens of Romania do, but only with a specific dialect.”

in the same link, you can find what the constitutional court from the republic of moldova thinks about this:

&gt;	Basing its conclusions on the fact that “the Romanian nation is organized as two Romanian states – Romania and Moldova,” the Constitutional Court decided that the “Declaration of Independence is an integral part of the Constitution,” and when differences between the text of the Declaration of Independence and the text of the Constitution arise, the “primary constitutional text of the Declaration of Independence prevails.” The Court confirmed that the official language of the Republic of Moldova is Romanian, not Moldavan.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/909s1s/google_autocomplete_for_why_does_for_european/e2q09wa/,bogdoomy,1532092114

Just a quick look into this should've been able to tell you that that's not how it works. Paternity tests are not illegal in France.

Since an infant can't give you consent, you will need to prove before a judge that there is a legitimate reason why you need to violate the child's DNA rights in order to establish paternity. You can't just accuse the mother of infidelity without evidence, and then violate the child's rights willy nilly.

Why do you think I disagree with you? I see your point. Some countries are afraid of Russia and it is a good idea for them to join NATO. And they have good reasons to be afraid.

I'm just saying that this is the only point of view you can see. And that you are incapable of seeing the same situation from other point of views. For example from Russia's point of view.

&gt;It is a threat to Russia because Russia is a threat to them. 

No, it is a threat to them because it allows US and NATO bases to be stationed directly on the Russian borders.

&gt;Russia is the one invading it's neighbors, not NATO. 

What about not neighbours? NATO infrastructure and command structure was used to overthrow governments, invade countries and generally bully everyone in the world on a much greater scale then whatever Russia has done. US and NATO left multiple countries in ruins. Russia is completely reasonable in being afraid of the US and by extension NATO.


&gt;Who in their right mind could defend that Russia must engage in a conflict with other countries simply because they don't want to be a part of the Russian sphere of influence. 

Are you familiar with Monroe doctrine? You know the one which was used to prevent any country in Americas to be aligned with USSR. The US conducted abductions, assassinations, armed cartels, invaded countries, blockaded countries, just so no one near them was aligned with USSR. And don't tell me like this is old way of doing things. It's not. The US still punishes Cuba for their allegiance to USSR to this day.

&gt;Russia is completely in the wrong and has become a threat to sovereign European nations. Their actions prove it. 

Was that the case in the 90s? No. Russia was not a threat back then. Still, NATO expanded... So no, NATO expansion was not the reaction to Russia's actions.

3341,"Something that never gets mentioned is that the Turkish Resistance Organisation TMT which controlled the village of Kofinou, created a pocket controlled by the Turkish local governor. In the beginning of 1967, Tsitin (turkish governor) prevented a police vehicle from entering the Greek Cypriot sector of the village Agios Theodoros, while there was regular blocking of the road traffic. This led then the President of the Republic of Cyprus to protest and appeal to the UN peacekeeping force. Because the UN didnt respond Makarios ordered Georgios Grivas to intervene.

As i mentioned in another comment Turkish forces like TMT or other guerilla groups were already organising and commiting crimes even against Turkish-Cypriots. 

&gt;The T.M.T. in fact, assassinated Turkish Cypriot police officers serving at the British Colonial Police that were working to detect any illegal weapons in their community

The Turks were already equipped after the decleration of Independence 16 August 1966

&gt;On October 18, 1959, the British Royal Navy seized the Turkish ship Denise, which carried large quantities of ammunition from Turkey . Revealing in a dramatic way the Turkish Cypriot partition projects and Turkey's active involvement in them, the Deniz episode intensified the fears of the Greek Cypriot community.

3381,"&gt;I was solely commenting on the legality of it, not the morality.

Legality is still very questionable. Whether facebook can or can not remove comments without violating rights is of secondary importance.

Whether Germany can ask facebook to apply german laws to facebooks non-german users is questionable. 

If they were asking to remove those posts from German citizens, sure that'd be okay. But not from others, others they have no authority over.

That is why removing it isn't an option and will never happen.  Geoblock is fine.

&gt;Is it such a strange concept to you that companies have to abide by laws?

To GERMAN laws from company that ISN'T GERMAN, on NON-GERMAN users... yes. Very much so. If Germany says they'll have to apply laws on germans citizens only that is fine. But saying that facebook has to remove posts of their non-german users or be blocked is absurd.

It's not just a strange concept, it's an horrible one.

&gt;I'd advise a bit of reading comprehension practice and try to think logical (or even think at all) the next time.

I'd say the same, but considering you're german, try not to think anything illegal or you might be punished.


Removing it is not okay from any non-german users. Hiding it from german users it's absolutely fine.

Edit: to make an easy example out of it.

Say that Germans are banned from owning Mein Kampf. Deleting the users posts who are not german  would be equivalent of asking all the digital libraries to not sell Mein Kampf to anyone in the world if they want to do business in germany. Which is absurd. Making it unorderable in germany/by german citizens would be fine. Same as hiding the posts would.

That person can be proud of his origin, nobody will argue against that, but once he is French, we will consider him as such, not discriminate him using color skin difference, or the country where he/his parent were born. 

The differenciation you are making is a way to delegitimize one as not ""really"" French, and in doing that you appear as someone who push for skin color before what the person feel/is right *now*. 

Creating a difference because of skin color, or region in which the parent are born *is* racist. And that is exactly what happened here. What he said is fundamentaly racist to a French crowd, and it seems somewhat shared by a good chunck of Europe. 

His argument is the one used by the Le Pen family and their nutjob followers, and is argument ""Context is everything"" work only to an extent. In that case the context is : The player are facing critics by the the right-wing asshat because they aren't white, because ""you don't look like that with a tan in Provence"". That *is* the context he made his remarks. 

I'd argue that is response his made by someone which ignore everything about the situation in our country and think the American ideal is the ""One best way"". I don't know if our way is the best, or if it's even good, but Trevor trying to take some kind of moral high ground because of American liberal ideals is something that I find deeply insulting.

3463,"the issues become more profound when you use racially based biological factors to exclude certain peoples than include. On the surface w all know that for genetically the best long distance runners you have to go to the east of africa, for the best shorter distance runners you go more west, or even moreso the people taken from the west to work in the carribean. Likewise there are non-neglibigble genetic differences in almost all parts of human endeavour as is to be expected. That being said talking about race is far less apt with humans as it is with for instance dogs because the genetic differences are much smaller. More importantly however is that these racial differences have been emphasized many times historically with notorious or even nefarius (sp?) intentions. 

Overall we live in a time where its easily more important to emphasize what bonds us all and not focus on what distinguishes us. Even when someone like Trevor Noah feels kinship with the French team because of some vaguely similar genetic markers its fine. When he starts defining the team as African he chooses for those players to emphasize their genetic background as well. Its one thing to offer people an option to opt-in and celebrate a common genetic background (although unless its actually a cultural heritage I think its silly), its a wholly different thing to choose for others with what they should associate. When a media personality of the size of Trevor Noah does say these things he must know he drives debate and that mean he has other ethical responsibilities than a private person.

All in all I think it was probably a bit blunt and it would be more apt if Noahs statement was a bit less unnuanced. The French government mightve also reacted a bit smarter and just kept their noses out of it or say something like ""We have seen 23 men who all identify themselves as French first and foremost thrive and reach glory. When one emphasizes the broad range of genetically diverse background the players have one undermines the unity of a team and undermines what the players of the team, each for themselves, have decided that binds all of them""",,/r/europe/comments/90755g/french_ambassador_to_the_us_to_trevor_noah_unlike/e2prj3n/,wicketRF,1532077819

3498,"English version, appearing at https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/07/jean-claude-drunker/:

Jean-Claude drunker: What's ailing the President of the European Commission?

The atmosphere in Brussels has become, of late, reminiscent of the late Brezhnev era. We have a political system run by a bureaucratic apparatus which — just like the former USSR — serves to conceal important evidence. Especially when it comes to the health of its supreme leader, Jean-Claude Juncker.

At the Nato summit gala dinner last week, videos emerged showing Juncker unable to climb the few steps leading to the podium. He hesitates at the bottom before being grabbed by the very sturdy Ukrainian Petro Poroshenko. He is then held up during the ceremony. Afterwards Juncker — who is only 63, hardly an old man — staggers and wobbles away, propped up by Mark Rutte and António Costa, prime ministers of the Netherlands and Portugal. When asked about the incident, Juncker said that he suffered from sporadic ‘sciatica’. This remains the official explanation.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJsrJUuonkM)

Anyone who dares question this explanation is guilty of ‘indecency’, according to Viviane Reding, an MEP and former Luxembourg commissioner. Reding is also the political patron of Martin Selmayr, Juncker’s great protégé, who recently plotted his way to become head of the mighty EU civil service. ‘I think it’s more than tasteless that some press try to make insulting headlines by exploiting President Juncker’s pain,’ said spokesman Margaritis Schinas. Move along, we are told: nothing to see.

But the ‘sciatica’ explanation does not really stand up to scrutiny. It would suggest Juncker suffered agonising back pain, but he did not seem to be in any discomfort. The video shows him smiling, laughing, talking and kissing his partners as they helped him walk. An acute crisis of sciatica nails its victims to bed. It’s possible that his movement may have been impaired by powerful painkillers. According to several sources, Juncker was actually in a wheelchair when photographers and TVs were not looking, and did not even speak during dinner.

This in itself would be quite a concern, given that the issues with Trump at that summit were vital for Europe. However, the same witnesses say Juncker drank heavily during the meal, which is difficult to reconcile with the use of painkillers.

And if he genuinely suffers from sciatica, how was he able to visit China and Japan a few days later? Sciatica makes such long-haul flights difficult to envisage. One diplomat jokes that if Juncker does suffer from debilitating back pain, he must be powered by ‘an uncommon moral force, an ability to withstand suffering for the good of Europe’.

The other explanation — and the assumption of a great many in Brussels — is Mr Juncker is a bit too fond of the bottle. Which he constantly denies. ‘I have a problem of balance with my left leg,’ he once said to us, ‘which forces me to grab the ramp when I’m on a staircase. A Dutch minister, whom I had grabbed by the arm after lunch, said I was drunk. The problem goes back to a serious car accident — in 1989 I spent three weeks in a coma, then six months in a wheelchair.’

Numerous people, in Luxembourg, in Brussels and in European capitals, can attest to several examples of Juncker drinking. ‘When a bailiff brings him a glass of water at a council of ministers, we all know it’s gin,’ says a former minister. The former Eurogroup president, Jeroen Dijsselbloem of the Netherlands, did not hesitate to describe on Dutch television a Luxembourgish man who was often drunk during Eurogroups.

Pierre Moscovici, a French European commissioner and former finance minister, delicately points out that alcohol ‘never prevented Juncker from being functional’. Sometimes, a little too functional. Everyone still remembers the scenes of the 2015 Riga summit when Juncker’s antics were on full display to the world’s cameras. Viktor Orbán was welcomed with a cheery ‘The dictator is coming!’ then a playful slap to the face. The Belgian Charles Michel was greeted with a kiss on his bald head. It was later put down to Juncker’s supposedly effervescent personality. As the leaders are not subject to breathalysers, we will never know any different.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTyrLjasVdw)

But his behaviour at the Nato summit went beyond jokes about tipsy Luxembourgers. The videos suggested a man manifestly seriously ill, unable to move alone. In other words, it raises the question of his ability to govern. It is no coincidence that he has become totally dependent on Martin Selmayr, his ambitious secretary general and former chief of staff (and architect of his ascent to the head of the EU). No wonder that Juncker tore up the rules of the European civil service to put Selmayr in charge of the whole 33,000-strong apparatus.

He even threatened to resign if the European Parliament demanded the departure of his protégé in an unprecedented move for a politician. The deterioration of Juncker combined with the power of Selmayr indicates an unusual set-up with the President as the puppet. Pull back the gin-soaked curtain and we may find the real influence is wielded by Selmayr, an unelected and unaccountable Eurocrat.

Juncker’s spokesman insists there is ‘no anxiety whatsoever about Juncker’s ability to work hard, as he always does’. But democracy demands total transparency in the form of an official health certificate. After what the world saw last week, this excuse will not do.

3540,"But it's not our shortcomings, foreign powers took over our country, destroyed it, divided the society and created these death squads.

If the Lithuania before 1939 or after 1991 would've done anything even remotely disgusting or atrocious, I would be the first one to blame Lithuania and make it into a huge issue.

The only organization that was absolutely not influenced by foreign powers during that period was the Lithuanian partisans of 1945-53. And we are proud of their achievements and critical of their sometimes brutal ways (it's also important to remember the historical context though).

LAF are not heroes and they're not regarded as heroes in the mainstream. The Partisans on the other hand are. And on that instance I agree, we should talk about the actions they needed to take in order to survive and resist. For example killing Russian settlers or racketeering the collaborants and non-collaborants.

In short, the 1945-53 Partisans are the Lithuanian heroes, I am ready to talk about their crimes and I'd love to see their hero status challenged.

As for USSR-Germany cooperation, that was just another mistake and failure of European politics and diplamacy. Soviets were rejected by all major powers of pre-war Europe, they saw what happened to Czechoslovakia and how that was done, they knew about pacts and treaties between European countries and Germany, and the choice was either make a treaty with Germany, or stand alone against hostile Europe.

Let's use myself as an example. One of my great grandmother was a black woman from Guyana, am I black enough to account for one full black person? Do I count for one half black person, one quarter black person in statistics? At what point do we stop considering me black if we ever did in the first place? Do the census man uses a colour chart before putting me into statistics? I am distinctly mediterranean looking even during winter, does that mean I can potentially jump category when I am just back from vacations and all tan? 

I think [this document](http://www.houlehistory.com/uploads/2/5/6/9/25696840/nuremberg-race-laws-chart-in-english-chart-ver-2_orig.jpg) may help you understand where our attitude towards the characterization of races comes from.

As we all know now (and that the jews didn't at the time) marriage was merely a first step and these charts later were used for much much worse.

Of course I am not suggesting that the US is just preparing to gas the blacks or something.

There is nothing wrong with being black, or referring to someone as black (when it’s relevant to the conversation). We all know we are talking about the color of someone’s skin, it’s disingenuous to pretend it’s more complicated than that.

3671,"This may be a poor excuse, but I wouldn't exactly consider reddit a microcosm of the US (and likewise this subreddit for *all* of Europe). Again, as someone who was born in the US and lives here, it's not something I've seen in real life. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but after 30+ yrs of existing here, I just don't see how it's happening anywhere near the frequency that some here are suggesting. To be honest, I feel like a lot of people in this thread are doing the very thing they're arguing against. That somehow they know the American experience and our culture better than those of us who live it every day. So many people here are all ""Oh no, I know America. I visited this single city, once, for a week several years ago and I watch a lot of Netflix; I know how they are."" OK.

&gt; Americans to focus on bloodlines and ethnicity

This part, however, is true. I had this whole thing typed out, using my life as an example as a ""second generation immigrant,"" but I'll skip it. Because the greater point is, that over time, bloodlines and ethnicity are all that many of us will have left. With each generation, more and more culture is lost. Language is usually the first to go. Then its family history and traditions. Food and drinks tend to stick around longer, but eventually most of that, aside from a dish or two, will go as well. 

For Americans, it's important to know where we come from. That's why ancestry.com and 23andMe and genealogy in general are so popular here. I can't explain why we value these tenuous strings to the past, but we do. One of the most interesting things a friend once said to me was, ""That's cool that you and your family have culture and stuff; my family doesn't have a whole lot of that. We're just plain white."" What a thing to hear, seriously. I didn't even know how to respond.

One last point I'll leave is that culture changes. Visiting my friends' families, I see these little unique traditions that many of them have. A certain type of cake for a child's 1st birthday. A special dish served on a holiday that I only ever have at this one family's get-togethers. Or some kind of gifting tradition at a wedding that I've never seen anywhere else. They come from somewhere. Is this something from the ""fatherland"" of Germany passed down here through the generations? Is that tradition even still alive back in Germany? Maybe it was just the tradition of a single town. Did this thing come about from a mixture of older Polish and Italian traditions, but now it just associated with Italian? Did those original immigrants from Norway, the great-great-great-great grandparents do this based on something they kinda remember from growing up in the old country? Maybe the simple answer is that the tradition isn't really that old and just something different grandma wanted to do when she had her first grandchild. Idk. But because we don't know any better, because some information is lost, and because this is what our antecedents called it, we too just call this thing we do an ""Irish tradition."" Because, you know, we're 1/64th Irish, let me tell ya over a Guinness...

TL;DR: If someone is insistent on being an idiot, feel free to set them straight as you see fit. But most of us aren't that way and we're not trying to be disrespectful and insulting.

a) you've doubled-down on your claim that black people in general, and in the US in particular, possess a kind of ""privilege"", and you lament that ""fact"" due to the supposed damage that effects on effective discussions. Would I be mischaracterising you if I said you believe this ""privilege"" b) infringes on your ability as a white man to express yourself freely? Could I even go as far as calling it a ""politically correctness issue""?

Furthermore, c) you hold that the #AllLivesMatter movement is **not** deeply, intrinsically racist, and that it didn't emerge from the American alt-right as an attempt to halt the momentum civil rights causes have been garnering in the US since the last couple of years.

But not content with that, as a white person, you're not all too comfortable without d) knowing what my race is (oh, sorry, ""heritage""), because ""context matters"" or something.

Am I getting all of this right? Because if I am, let me tell you, you're not only mistaken about a) though c) (with d) being so sad it's not even funny, in a stereotypical kind of way), but you're broadcasting all the dogwhistles that white supremacists use to identify eachother in non-safe spaces.

3787,"No, that's just not true.  When people say ""I'm Greek"" or ""I'm Italian"", they don't mean ""I have some &lt;Country&gt; heritage"".

At an absolute minimum it means ""virtually all my ancestry can be traced back to &lt;Country&gt;"".

Normally it also means ""my family has traditions that I think are the same as what they do in &lt;Country&gt;"".  It also frequently means ""I'm fiercely proud of the history and culture of &lt;Country&gt; (as I understand them)"" and ""If I ever visited &lt;Country&gt; I'd fit right in"".

I've heard this from ""Greeks"", ""Italians"", ""Irish"", ""Dutch""...

What's really interesting is that the food / culture they associate with &lt;Country&gt; is frequently a snapshot frozen in time.

In Dublin today someone might grab something to eat at Nando's, or if they go to a pub they might get a curry, a crispy pork belly, or a pad thai, or something like that.

3928,"&gt;Is MAD really sustainable in the long run?

I think best way to answer this is the question. MAD is a political joke, satire. The actual term is AD, ""assured destruction"" - basically, it means the amount of weapons you need to completely destroy an enemy nation. MAD just means ""mutual assured destruction"" - because the enemy is doing example the same.

Now, AD isn't a strategy, it's basically just a cost saving measure. It marks the point where you don't need more nukes; so you don't have that expensive, crazy shit like 50.000 nuclear warheads lying around. If you can't disarm, you might as well limit your arsenal.

&gt;and it will mean the end of the human race

That's going too far. But it will cause irreperable damage to the planet. No question.

&gt;Not having a system, any kind of system, to reliably defend against a nuclear attack is going to kill us when, not if, it happens. We need to invest now, rather than later.

There is no system to do that, likely never will be. As said, it's a pipe dream. A defense platform will only make the AD numbers go up, nuclear piles grow a bit, and weapons evolve to avoid those defensive systems.

This has always been the primary dynamic in human warfare: Offensive power beats defensive power.

^(edit:) Also, as for nukes; at some point in time the Russian IIRC had 70.000 nuclear warheads. Just think about that. Everyone has disarmed, and the US has about 3.000 warheads, which is still enough to kill anyone. There is no way to defend against so many nukes, and you can scale so far till you're actually able to burn the planets surface.",Lower Saxony (Germany),/r/europe/comments/907urs/putin_warns_nato_against_closer_ties_with_ukraine/e2ozvo5/,reymt,1532041613

3938,"Yea I can understand that that is pretty weird.  


I think it comes from a lack of a long standing unified culture and national identity. Unless you are a native American, anyone who is living in the US and is 3rd generation or more isn't really a part of a long, deep and unique culture like European countries are. Yes, we do live differently than across the pond, but, for example, the few foods that are ""American"" are probably mostly adaptions or derivatives of foods from somewhere else. Because, the US is composed of people from such a wide array of places, I think it has a bit of an averaging effect of how we live in some aspects.  


Furthermore, with the pervasiveness of US media, most people in the west know a good deal about life in the US, whereas it doesn't really work as well in the other direction. Furthermore, many other westerners also know English since it is an international language. Finally, the US is culturally homogeneous and not really close to a large number of other cultures. 

I think that you are underestimating the effect that this can have to make it feel like you are just ""people living in a place"". It is quite easy to feel like the ""default person"". Speaking English in the west does not make you unique, our culture is more or less just a blend of other cultures. It seems like someone is from another country, they have everything you have, but also there is something ""added on"" or unique from where they come from that sets them apart and makes them different. It is common for there to be cultural centers for many European countries in our cities, I don't know for sure but id bet there isn't one US cultural center in Europe!

So, anyway I think in general carrying a cultural identity over many generations is just people wanting to connect themselves to some sort of (at least perceived) cultural uniqueness. But, maybe this is bullshit, or maybe there is another reason. That's my 2 cents though. 

On a side not perhaps the the feeling of belonging to a unique culture is somewhat needed? Maybe the whole ""MURICA"" thing is just an over-compensation for lacking in this area? Then again, Canada and some other countries are kinda in the same boat, and they are not as nationalistic.

I can honestly understand that and don't think it's that terrible. Of course it's cool to root for someone you can relate to, but that's not the topic here. The topic is that Trevor (like many other US outlets) pretends the ""Africa won the world cup!""-comments are legitimate because surely there's nothing bad about being both French *and* African.

The main issue with that is that in a European context these comments are exclusively [made by right-wing extremists](https://twitter.com/marceldirsus/status/1018591273639399424) to point out that these people are not French and can never be French because of their origin or color of skin.

4059,"&gt;What I don't get is how the hell third wave feminism gets the attention there that it does. Wasn't the US in a way a champion of women's rights? It's like they are still stuck in the 1910's mentality wise.

That's a little more complex, because it's not what you think. To go into more than necessary detail (again):

What makes third-wave feminism distinct from the first two waves is the lack of a central point, a shared ideology. As in, while all three waves had people that wanted them to be about more than that, Wave 1 was still united around suffrage and Wave 2 was united around equal rights in education/the workplace. Wave 3 has... nothing like that, so in practice, it's just a general term for a bunch of separate ideologies/aims with basically nothing in common.

The particular problem with that - other than the obvious, that it  means each aim has significantly less support - is that it makes it real easy for people to stereotype third-wave feminism to be whatever they want it to be. Want it to be just legal equality and nothing more? Sure. Want it to be about affirmative action? Yeah, you can do that. Want it to be about stupid easy-to-argue stuff? Yup, that's an option too. Just say ""This is what most feminists are like, and anyone else calling themselves feminist are just a minority"".

It's particularly effective because very few people *do* see it as a general term for a bunch of separate ideologies/aim with basically nothing in common, and with no way to measure what the most popular ideology is - and thus, the idea that third-wave feminism can be mainly about one specific thing is just stupid. So it continues, on and on, with people just perpetuating whatever their social bubble says without realising they're in a bubble, and getting angry when people don't agree with them about what feminism is.

4110,"How are they using the word ""secular"" here? As far as I know that implies the separation of church and state. 

They go onto say:

&gt;While it is well documented that rich countries tend to be secular whilst poor countries tend to be religious, it is still unclear if secularisation causes wealth or the other way around?

Where they present a dichotomy between ""secular"" and ""religious"" countries. Yet as the USA proves, you can have a very secular system of government but also a very religious population (comparably to the western world). 

...and I've just found the abstract:

&gt;The decline in the everyday importance of religion with economic development is a well-known correlation, but which phenomenon comes first? Using unsupervised factor analysis and a birth cohort approach to create a retrospective time series,**we present 100-year time series of secularization in different nations, derived from recent global values surveys**, which we compare by decade to historical gross domestic product figures in those nations. We find evidence that a rise in secularization generally has preceded economic growth over the past century. Our multilevel, time-lagged regressions also indicate that tolerance for individual rights predicted 20th century economic growth even better than secularization. These findings hold when we control for education and shared cultural heritage.

So it looks like they're measuring secularism by the change of values from surveying populations over time. Oh well, so it's got nothing to do with the type of government just where these populations score in these value surveys.

Most of them will want to stay where they're already living. Which is in neighboring Arab countries, Europe, and the Americas. They have a life there already. But you are correct that Palestine could not bear 5 million immigrants. Both Israel and Palestine are tiny and already very populated besides the desert.

&gt; land swap being completely unequal

It's complicated. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Camp_David_Summit

&gt; The Palestinian and Israeli definition of the West Bank differs by approximately 5% land area as the Israeli definition does not include East Jerusalem (71 km²), the territorial waters of the Dead Sea (195 km²) and the area known as No Man's Land (50 km2 near Latrun).[5]

&gt; Based on the Israeli definition of the West Bank, Barak offered to form a Palestinian state initially on 73% of the West Bank (that is, 27% less than the Green Line borders) and 100% of the Gaza Strip. In 10–25 years, the Palestinian state would expand to a maximum of 92% of the West Bank (91 percent of the West Bank and 1 percent from a land swap).[5][7] From the Palestinian perspective this equated to an offer of a Palestinian state on a maximum of 86% of the West Bank.[5]

&gt; demilitarisation of Palestine

&gt; Palestine cannot make a foreign policy decision or make alliances

You can't deny that Israel needs some substantial security guarantees. These can be adjusted in the future if peace and cooperation materializes.

&gt; Israel would maintain management of the West Bank's water resources

Since the Oslo accords there has been joint water management. Sadly the Palestinians haven't fully cooperated. A joint administration of the water resources can certainly be done. It would be a great project to build neighborly trust. Israel needs water to live. I'm sure a compromise could be worked out here.

&gt; this is the best that the Palestinians could have - and the Palestinians know that time isn't on Israel's side, all they have to do is wait until people get sick and tired of Israel's bullshit

That's the gamble that the Palestinians have been doing since the foundation of the state of Israel. It hasn't been going terribly well for them. The most progress they made, was with the Oslo accords. Time is actually working against them because Israel has been changing the facts on the ground. At some point Israel will dictate borders and conditions and Palestinians will be left with what Israel gives them. 

&gt; Palestinians and their descendants who were expelled or otherwise fled and remain in a legally stateless limbo to this day

800,000 Jews were expelled from Arab countries after the creation of Israel. They can't go back either. It was a population exchange that can't practically be undone three generations later. Palestinians have Palestinian citizenship. Palestine is a state, that's internationally recognized by many countries. Many also have citizenship of Jordan, Egypt, Israel, or many other states.

&gt; It sucks ass all around for us, inside or outside.

Yes, it does. That's why a peace deal with some painful compromises is necessary. Just blaming Israel for everything is a dead end politically. There haven't been free elections for the Palestinians for over a decade now. Palestinians are also politically divided. The struggle against Israel is the only unifier. It's very sad to see actually how progress in Palestinian civil society and economy has stalled or even deteriorated. The Palestinian leadership has failed the Palestinians.

Once peace comes and materializes movement of people, goods, and services between the two countries can solidify this into a great relationship. A peace treaty doesn't have to be the end of the development of the Palestinian-Israeli relationship. It will be a starting point.

It's understandable that people of color in the US are happy for those in France, but the link lies in the shared experience in their personal lives of being descendants of the colonialized living in colonial countries. Not on being African, because they're not. A lot of them never even set foot in Africa. Sure, they are of African descent, but so are we all if we go back far enough.

I think the problem mostly stems from differences in what we consider identity. Here you have to be recognized by the group to whom you identify to be recognized. If no African state or authority recognizes you as a citizen, you are not African. In the US, identity seems more indulgent in what individuals choose to identify with, closer to lifestyle or behavior.

&gt; Stop wasting time and effort policing a globe that doesn't want US policing. Focus on problems at home.

There are government sanctioned massacres going on in Nicaragua, should the US get involved and drag France into that? Isn't that just about the same thing? How about Venezuela?

4382,"&gt; And still Switzerland has a pretty low homicide rate. Lower than the UK for example. 

I have obviously never said that guns are the only factor, but it is a fact that they are linked to more crimes/suicides/mass shootings. So Switzerland would maybe have an even lower murder rate if there were less guns. 

&gt; The articles you linked are focussed on the US and state that more guns do not provide more safety. 

That's just the first article. The second one says that guns are linked to more suicides, the third one says that guns are linked to more mass shootings, the fourth one says that guns lead to more aggravated assaults, homicides, and robberies.

&gt; This does not automatically imply that less guns mean more safety. 

Yes it is, since the other three articles say so.

&gt; The comparison CH-GB falsifies that latter hypothesis.

Again, you don't understand what ""is linked to"" or ""leads to"" mean. Of course guns are not the only reason, but they are linked to more crimes/murders.

&gt; One of the articles and yourself relate gun laws to suicide, which is estremely disrespectful to anyone that commited suicide or was close to anyone that commited suicide. Suicidal people have serious problems, often they are suffering for years or decades before they commit suicide. No one just think ""oh, I have a gun at home - I am just going to kill myself for no reason""

This just shows how ignorant on suicide you are. It is a matter of fact that having an easy and immediate way to kill yourself is linked to more suicides. If someone has to walk to a bridge or to a train station it might change his mind while doing so, if in a moment of desperation he has a gun next to him it's just easier. Try to actually read scientific studies on the matter instead on basing your opinions on your feelings.


&gt; If politicians are telling rubbish like stricter gun laws are needed to reduce suicides that is a terrible insult to anyone that has ever been suicidal in his live because they are ignoring that there is alway a reason for a sucide.


Facts says that they are helping them, you are being disrespectful. Feel ashamed and base your opinions on facts and scientific studies, not feelings.


&gt; Just like the sole existance of trains does not make people commit suicide. It's a scornful thing abusing suicides for ones own political agenda

&gt; Now a free trade agreement is a downgrade compared to Internal Market membership so there will be increased trade barriers between the EU and Czechia, these increased trade barriers causes an economic downturn (an assumption on my part).

4472,"&gt; What time frame? How long after the referendum should the next one be? And if we choose to stay that time, how long until the leave people have the next one so they can get their way? How many do-overs does each side get before we actually make a decision to leave or stay for an extended period of time, or do we just keep having them every couple of years until someone scores three in a row or something? 

As often as necessary to make up your mind, or until you have a binding one. And even then it's perfectly sensible to be able to have a new one if there's demand to change it once again, after having experienced what it is.

&gt;Protest votes are a thing, and that’s why it was explicitly said over and over in the run up to the referendum they weren’t going to do another one, that this was the vote for the decision. 

Then they should have made it a *binding* one. Without making it binding, it's just a promise not to hold another one, just like it was just a promise of May when she was in the remain camp and when she promised not to hold general elections.

&gt;Look I’d be happy if we get a lifeline out of this, but stuck in a never ending indicission loop is more damaging for the country than even a bad choice. Fact is even now all the info and shit storm is out there it’s still about 50/50 so whatever the result of another referendum, there’ll still be a huge calling for ‘just one more to get it right’. Sometimes common sense looses, and that’s democracy too. 

Sure, but that's why you have binding and non-binding referenda. Non-binding ones are just large opinion polls, and politicians act on them as other opinion polls: go run in front of them and pretend they lead them, or try to convince them to run to other way (by shouting there's fire in that direction and cake in the other direction or something).

4479,"&gt;but it also has to take care of the people living within it's borders, regardless of their citizenship.

Yes, but not to the extent that it takes care of its own citizens.

&gt;Why do these people not deserve to be looked after, if they are legal residence, thus have been approved by the country?

I will try to expand: the reality of nation states means that certain borders determine where we can go as people - that's a fact. Luckily, we have advanced to a point where we're peaceful and cooperative enough where we can cross those borders. However, states reserve the right to determine who gets in, and who doesn't - after all, you might be bad for all the citizens living in it, and the primary duty of the state is to protect its' citizens.

Now we have a system where foreigners are welcome, but only under certain conditions - i.e. don't be a financial drain on us (don't take our money), and we'll share our collective resources with you (Roads, police, culture). There are some resources we won't share, because we've reserved them for ourselves - it cost us an arm and a leg to save for them, so we won't share those.

You must have misunderstood me desperately to believe I want second class citizens - no one is arguing for that. People working and paying in to the system, and have the intent to integrate and become permanent part of the system, shouldn't be denied anything (provided they pass the requirements we set). 

But priorities are priorities. If my state has limited resources, and is forced to choose between the wellbeing of a citizen, and the wellbeing of a foreigner, I 100% expect it to choose the citizen. It *must* choose the citizen. That is why the state exists. We should help the foreigner to the extent that we *can*, but that limit is where our capacity to help our own is too high.

I did. You never bothered to reply to my statements, though.

&gt;Since you've never watched how a tech company is built up close, your advice is just dangerous.

No, I gave plenty of counterexamples that show that hands-on experience is not necessary to make useful statements about a subject.

In fact, it might bias you because you're an interested party then with a stake in the outcome, not a neutral observer. Surely we can get more tech companies by advantaging them at the expense of the rest of society, but that's not good policy.

This is simply not how the German army works post-1945. The German soldier is not trained to be an emotionless, opinionless robot. They are trained to be a thinking individual.

&gt;It's different because we are talking about an ideology and a march supporting it. Soldiers should not take part in any such political movements. Otherwise they could as well march in a neo-nazi march or an Islamist march or whatever in their uniforms and no one should have a say in it...

The likely main difference today is, that you yourself are now paying much closer attention to the details of those relationships than you did before, so you see the fractures more clearly. 

Your world war fears are unfounded though. Europe and USA have no interest in a war with Russia. Neither does Russia, but they're not in a shape to wage a conventional war even against Europe anyway, let alone Europe backed by the US. A nuclear war on the other hand ends bad for everyone, so no rational actors wants to initiate one unless their very existence is under immediate threat. 

The conditions for pushing for a major direct military confrontation just aren't there on any side. The main reasons tensions are high now are Russia's annexation of Crimea ─ area of land for which only Russians are willing to bleed for, so they'll likely end up keeping it ─ and US internal politics ─ which can turn on a dime as political convenience dictates. There are other things causing friction, but that's the kind of stuff that is typical with Russia, so it's just business as usual.

4611,"no, but we have similar freedom of movement thing as the EU. Though certain categories of British subjects get to vote.

https://www.aec.gov.au/Enrolling_to_vote/British_subjects.htm

This is more a hangover from when it was easy for Brits to migrate to Australia, but very few people fall into this category now says (dual citizenship is something that has only happened in the last 20 years in both countries).

I have a family friend that falls into this category, she has citizenship of Ireland and the UK and perminate residency in Australia (not all three allowed in the past multiple citizenships beyond two). she couldn't give up her Irish citizenship because she could here her dad voice in her head (Irish speaking parents), but she grew up in the UK and didn't want to give that up as she identifies as British, but she's been here 40 years as a perminate resident.

The freedom of movement is not equal though as Aussies get an easier ride in NZ than Kiwis get in Australia. 

This is apparantly because Australia has a much more robust welfare system than NZ (they are more socially liberal but fiscally conservative than Australia) and kiwis were moving to Australia for the dole so we removed that right, but that was a few decades ago.

A lot more kiwis have historically moved to Australia than vice versa (much higher wages across the board in Australia), but the last year it has tipped the other way- some say due to our out housing bubble but I'm not sure.",ɐıןɐɹʇsnɐ,/r/europe/comments/8zis7n/brexit_campaign_group_vote_leave_has_been_fined/e2nl6z3/,Suburbanturnip,1531991144

The only solution is an agreement on customs, but that doesn't have to extend to a customs union. And that has been the UK position..

&gt; As an example, consider the 'Facilitated Customs Arrangement' that was proposed in the white paper recently released by the UK government. It's the definition of cherry picking. They're fantasizing the most far-fetched mechanisms to avoid the need for customs checks.

How is it cherry picking? It doesn't see the UK benefiting from EU membership while not being a member, it proposes a mechanism for minimising friction in trade, while still leaving the UK in a very different position to EU members.  It seems some people are using 'cherry picking' to simply mean 'the UK and EU make life easier for each other'.

&gt;The people remaining in the EU aren't trying to push the UK into anything. They just want the UK government to actually commit to a choice and live with the consequences.

4739,"Good question, and I believe it has to do with how far apart on the spectrum of societies different societies are. For example, the French and the English are obviously different (in terms of culture, language, etc) which would seem to suggest that if there were 'only' French people immigrating into England, then the French would be discriminated against, as the French would be considered 'them' and the english (despite all their internal differences) would be considered 'us'. 


However, if there is immigration from cultures far apart on the spectrum from both England and France, these immigrants now become the 'them', and the French would now be included in the 'us' category. (Massive oversimplification, but I believe that it roughly corresponds to what occurs.) 


If you put people together, too quickly, from cultures who are too far apart on the spectrum of cultures, they will form tribes of their own fellow tribesmen (not only to do with skin colour, but that is the most salient feature, so that's what mostly differentiates between 'me' and 'you') and band together against people of other tribes. (I think this is best encapsulated in the Bedouin saying: *""Me against my brother; me and my brother against my cousin; me, my brother, and my cousin against the stranger.""*)


On to the question. Western Europe 'is' one of the safest areas in human history, it's true, but that doesn't mean you can get rid of the tribalistic tendencies that humans exhibit which can eventually lead to violence. To lump people from different cultures all together in the same space can be a recipe for violence and may be *a* catalyst for getting extreme right-wingers into power. So, right now it *is* safe, but you need to be able to maintain that safety indefinitely across time, and the conditions aren't set for an indefinite maintenance at the moment precisely because of this human tribalism.

Personally I don’t care that much world’s chronically over populated, so it’s not a wholly bad thing that people are having less babies, and yes they might be “foreign” (oh no) but they’ll still grow up British, and generally adopt the similar attitudes to having babies as their peers.",,/r/europe/comments/8zyc35/births_to_foreignborn_mothers_hit_28_in_england/e2nhqqz/,Jjex22,1531984651

4787,"This is very very shortsighted on the part of Mr Babis.

He says that we cannot take migrants from all the planet... This plan concerns refugees only, who will go through an application and processing to be classified as such, if they are indeed migrants they'll be denied asylum and this will count against them on any and all future applications (they'll also promptly receive deportation orders).

Furthermore, the paper on which the EU commissions recommendation is made actually focuses on migratory patterns in the long run (up to 2030), this plan is to try and **avoid** the situations we had in 2015~2016 by making a more robust migration system throughout the EU so that we are all better equipped to handle the future, Wherever the migratory flows come from, rather than narrowly taking steps to prevent flows from specific countries.

Mr Babis proposes that we send money and other aid to North African countries to deal with the refugees over there, but again, what if 2 years from now a situation develops in Turkey? What if 4 years from now, an economic crisis hits Russia and brings about the collapse of the Russian government? We would have to start from scratch again, sending money there to manage a crisis but in the meantime we will still not have the tools to deal with incoming migratory flows that make landfall on EU soil. 

Also who would you even send the money too? In the example of Lybia; the internationally recognized government in Lybia has no control outside of Tripoli, their primary contenders are a loose assembly of warlords and militias led by one man who control patches of the country, what if that man dies? Who will take our money then and what will they do with it? How much will we have to spend just to ensure that it isn't directly funding ISIS who still has a presence in the country? What about the rampant corruption in these countries? How much of my tax-Euros is Babis planning to waste building and running summer camps on the Mediterranean??? 

Plus implementing one **doesn't mean we can't do the other**. Just because we build a robust system to deal with migrants &amp; refugees inside the EU, with safeguards to protect us from terrorist infiltration and strong cultural integration promulgation (mandatory language classes, conditional work permits based on respect of rule of law etc..) doesn't mean that we can't build up FRONTEX, doesn't mean we can't sign policies to tighten the definition of refugee, doesn't mean we are just sitting here waiting to be taken advantage of... and as matter of fact this is part of what this policy covers, stronger external border controls! Outreach and aid for countries identified as embarkation points in the Mediterranean... This is exactly what he wanted.

The EU is taking one step among many to ensure we have a long term solution to any and all migration crisis because the fact of the matter is these are going to become more and more common as climate change takes a drastic toll on the poorest nations in the middle east.

Finally, I'd like to ask what should we do to ensure that our allies are not going to create another migration crisis as a way of extracting favours from the EU.... Turkey is planning to build a series of dams along the Tigres and Euphrates rivers, so much so that it's **planned** one of them will no longer reach the ocean... Iraq is massively reliant on those rivers for it's very fragile agriculture and hydro electric sectors (Mosul dam anyone?) what happens when Iraqis begin starving by the thousands in 2020-something? Where do you think these people will go?


P.S: I urge everyone to at least skim through the proposals: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1530266108883&amp;uri=CELEX:52018PC0473

You'll notice it's called ""REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing, as part of the **Integrated Border Management Fund**, the instrument for financial support for **border management and visa**"" Which is kind of what Babis is talking about minus aid for the Mediterranean countries.

And then the deal itself which brought this response from Mr Babis:

**FIRST LINE FROM THE FIRST PARAGRAPH:**

4804,"&gt; It's also going to be disastrous for EU, as UK can leave without paying the EU a red cent and give EU a finger rather than follow the Article 50 procedures and settling of debts.

The UK leaving without a deal doesn't mean that the EU would have to stop pursuing the Brexit financial settlement. The EU represents  (at least) ~43% of the UK's foreign trade, it can make a future deal conditional on Britain living up to its past financial commitments. Or it could sue the UK before an international court. Also, as Brexiteers somehow keep forgetting, the EU is a lot bigger than Britain and is therefore proportionally less affected by anything the UK does than the other way around.And it's not like the EU has no financial reserves.

You didn't really outline reasons above, beyond ""your definition is too broad"" (without explaining how, or why this matters) and basically saying ""your application of idpol is bad, mine isn't"" (again without explaining why until this latest response).

&gt;But you can redefine any position to be group membership based unless someone is advocating for a political position that relates to himself and nobody else (which is just about impossible). 

So why use the term at all if you think the term is too vague and open to misapplication, rather than applying it selectively to groups that you personally disagree with? Why not use the term 'minority politics', for example? It would have the same utility, only without the dishonest claim that only minorities have 'identities' and only minorities express those group identities when they go to vote.

Next - I think you're confusing several issues here:

&gt; it's not so much about which group membership it relates to but more about how you use it;

You've digressed from discussing what constitutes 'idpol' to how you think idpol should be used, which is not something I have commented on.

&gt;if it's used to weaponize a group to act as a voting block for unjust, arbitrary power moves (let's say you want race or gender quotas) or if it's deliberately disharmonious to society (promoting separatism or non-integration of ethnic, religious groups and wanting them to act as a group or a voting block rather than individuals in order to claw for power).

These are your subjective opinions underlaid with your own personal beliefs and biases, not objective fact that does not need qualification.

&gt;I don't see anything wrong with them because in fighting for your interests, you're making things better overall. Same thing if a racial group wants to fight for equality of opportunity if they're denied based on race. Goals of any such campaign should be finite and temporary; gay rights movement for example had a clear goal - social acceptance and equal rights. 

Rather than defending your point as to why nationalist and ethnonationalist politics in Europe is excluded from the term 'idpol', you're continuing to expound on which *kinds* of idpol you subjectively think are justifiable. 

&gt;But if they continued operating as a power group beyond that and tried to form a voting block in order to extract special benefits like special seats in parliament, I would condemn that as identity politics. 

What are you basing this definition on, because I've never seen it described like this and it seems fairly arbitrarily decided by you. And again, you're not arguing against my point.

&gt;So people getting together to protest unfair treatment is reasonable but people getting together to take something they can't get even when they had an equal shot is a form of weaponization of that identity; identity politics

Again, shifting from discussing **what** is idpol to talk instead about when you subjectively feel idpol is legitimate. 

&gt;But when people advocate based on identity, they're not trying to use reason and logic, they're trying to use their identity; 

This is also what white racists and ethnonationalists do.

&gt;This is sort of what you suggested in your question to me.

How did I do that? I feel like I responded in a fairly appropriate way in light of how you worded this paragraph in your previous message:

&gt;And I think that's the goal; if you want to engage in race base or **some other nonsense interest group** based identity politics and don't want to be called out on it, you can broaden definition so you can simply fire back and say ""you're doing the same"" and **get away with your toxic, divisive movement**

Next:

&gt;A position is right or wrong regardless of who I am.

Still staying off-topic and you've now turned to discussing the worth of idpol to begin with, which is not something I have commented on in this thread.

&gt;And identity politics players put identity above arguments and reason because their moves aren't justified 

Yes, and I can argue the exact same thing regarding white nationalists or racists.

&gt;so they can win by shaming you for questioning them -- ""you are racist/sexist/homophobe/islamophobe for disagreeing with me""

This is exactly what right-wingers do when they dismiss opinions because they've come from 'libtards' and the like.

&gt;It's not different to ""white Europe"" and people talking about white Europe are engaging in identity politics.

So you agree with me.

&gt;But national culture is something that can transcend race and is worth protecting. The reason why Europe is peaceful and rich is because of our culture, our values, institutions and ways of doing things. If people who want to come here don't hold the same values and do not wish to integrate into this system, we have a good reason to reject them because this place will get worse if this system breaks down.

That is a funny way to spell Trump.  George was a low level nobody in his twenties.  He did not have any authority and having a conversation with an academic in Russia is not illegal regardless of the topic.  If he has been cooperating with Mueller and it has not gone anywhere then that has nothing to do with Trump.  

As for Flynn, that is too funny.  He was tapped as the future national security advisor and AFTER the election was over he spoke is a foreign ambassador.  Oh the horror.  He did not do anything even slightly wrong at that point.  He later got in trouble for lying and soon after Trump found out he had been dishonest Trump fired him.  Compare that to Obama and Hillary.  Hillary lied about far more serious issues like the email scandal and Benghazi and Obama never fired her and in fact actively campaigned to try and make her the next president.

Who is tougher on liers?  Trump or Obama?  Were you this outraged when Obama did not fire Hillary?

This is simple human nature, and of course, rule of law and legal code. 

We live in different habitats largely depending in which Hemispheres, continents, or regions we're in. I find it odd that you bring up habitat, since humans are versatile and can nowadays survive in almost any biome in the world (unlike many other organisms). We are adaptable and dynamic, yet today, we are not exclusively nomads. We settle and cultivate what's our own, and if that fails, we move elsewhere yet this still includes personal property/territory. I'm talking about globalist trends of moving around the world, traveling, yet still, there are boundaries set up so that one is not an intruder, so that they are held accountable for breaking any laws abroad, respect foreign customs, pay for services etc.",,/r/europe/comments/8zvmbi/bionazis_go_green_in_germany/e2n9c3q/,[deleted],1531972786

Each of them were governed by their own courts and had their own laws, but they all shared the same king. It was kind of like the Commonwealth. When the king wanted to do something, he had to negotiate with each court separately.  
Despite the Crown being called that, Aragon didn't hold much power in this federation, as it was poor, sparsely populated and had no access to the sea; the Aragon courts actually tried to push a more Castillian-like union (centered on them ofc) to no avail. Castille had a different system where the laws were more unified, and governance more hierarchical - it effectively worked as one kingdom with a few oddities here and there. In fact, once Ferdinand the Catholic died and the Crown of Aragon ended up in Castillian hands\*, their lack of cohesion was seen as more and more of a problem (remember the part about having to negotiate with each territory), and Castillian rulers made quite an effort to suppress it.

\*: Despite all of the talk about the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella ""unifying Spain"", their union was more of a personal than territorial one. They both avoided to stick their hands in eachother's business. When Isabella died in 1504, Ferdinand was appointed as regent of Castille at first, but he had to refuse because of pressures by the Castillian aristocracy who saw him as a foreign intruder, and was pretty much expelled from Castille. He then married Germaine of Foix to try to leave a heir for the Crown of Aragon and keep both Crowns separated, but it didn't work out. In fact, when he later had to take charge of Castille again because his daughter with Isabella (Joanne the Crazy) was insane, he just left it in the hands of Cardinal Cisneros since he didn't want to set a foot in there again.  
Even with Castillian kings holding the CoA, ""proper"" unification didn't actually happen until the aftermath of the War of Succession and the infamous Nueva Planta decrees in the early 18th century.

5095,"&gt; Are you arguing against this definition because a broadened definition is less useful to you?

Maybe I disagree with it for the reasons I outlined? If you're not going to take my words at face value and instead assume some nefarious motives, there's no point having a conversation. This is very important and I'll bring it up in a moment. 

&gt;I'm not arguing that all politics is identity politics, I'm arguing that politics specifically pertaining to group membership is (and you've yet to explain why this is not the case other than objecting to a broadened definition because... reasons)

But you can redefine any position to be group membership based unless someone is advocating for a political position that relates to himself and nobody else (which is just about impossible). 

Here is how I think about it (and I haven't fully thought this through so this is a rough draft): it's not so much about which group membership it relates to but more about how you use it; if it's used to weaponize a group to act as a voting block for unjust, arbitrary power moves (let's say you want race or gender quotas) or if it's deliberately disharmonious to society (promoting separatism or non-integration of ethnic, religious groups and wanting them to act as a group or a voting block rather than individuals in order to claw for power). There are group related issues which are legitimate like working class complaining about minimum wage that is set too low or immigrants displacing them because they agree to work in worse conditions which brings everyone down; because these are fair and reasonable complaints that have implications not just for them but for the whole society (implications for fiscal policy, more crime due to poverty, etc) I don't see anything wrong with them because in fighting for your interests, you're making things better overall. Same thing if a racial group wants to fight for equality of opportunity if they're denied based on race. Goals of any such campaign should be finite and temporary; gay rights movement for example had a clear goal - social acceptance and equal rights. But if they continued operating as a power group beyond that and tried to form a voting block in order to extract special benefits like special seats in parliament, I would condemn that as identity politics. So people getting together to protest unfair treatment is reasonable but people getting together to take something they can't get even when they had an equal shot is a form of weaponization of that identity; identity politics 

Now the discussion shifts from WHO is advocating for what but whether or not the position is GOOD (fair, makes society as whole better and isn't just a power move). And we can have reasonable disagreements over whether someone is right or not. But when people advocate based on identity, they're not trying to use reason and logic, they're trying to use their identity; they'll shut you down on the grounds that simply because you don't belong to that group and you disagree with them, you must be doing it because you don't care about that group; it couldn't possibly be because they're wrong. This is sort of what you suggested in your question to me. In other words, I want to talk about issues, not about identity itself. **A position is right or wrong regardless of who I am.** And identity politics players put identity above arguments and reason because their moves aren't justified and can't win in the marketplace of ideas so they can win by shaming you for questioning them -- ""you are racist/sexist/homophobe/islamophobe for disagreeing with me""

&gt;Now please show me how a minority basing their politics on race (aka, 'some other nonsense interest group') is qualitatively different to white people voting to protect 'white Europe', 'national culture' etc.

It's not different to ""white Europe"" and people talking about white Europe are engaging in identity politics. But national culture is something that can transcend race and is worth protecting. The reason why Europe is peaceful and rich is because of our culture, our values, institutions and ways of doing things. If people who want to come here don't hold the same values and do not wish to integrate into this system, we have a good reason to reject them because this place will get worse if this system breaks down.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/8zvskp/my_grandfather_wasnt_a_nazifighting_war_hero_he/e2n2ily/,domyne,1531965659

5127,"&gt; No school shooter inspires other people to shoot schools 

Hasn't that actually been proven to be true? Copycats are a thing, and media coverage encourages such phenomenon, it's like they're keeping a leader board of the shooters. 

The point is, it's still a problem. Whether it's driven by ideology, as you claim, which honestly I don't really buy, or other societal problems, in the end both are very real problems, but that does't stop society from going on and it certainly isn't an unprecedented disaster as you hyperbolically claim, unless you're willing to also claim that about school shootings. 

As for ideology driving terrorism, nah, terrorist organizations is what drive them. The fact that they use religion instead of whatever else bullshit is pretty irrelevant. Terrorist organizations are guerilla warfare units basically. They thrive in chaos, poverty and lack of education, mostly in war zones. They pretty much brainwash people, many since they are very young and vulnerable. It takes a lot of brainwashing for someone to be convinced to blow themselves up and kill innocent people. 99.99% of Muslims aren't going to blow themselves up because Allah told them so, but terrorist organizations that brainwash kids, using religion as well as other means, do. 

Really though, any religion could be used like that, it's false to assume that Islam is so special in this regard, people can be brainwashed by Christianity just as much, it's just that most of the Christian world is very stable in comparison and doesn't have terrorist organizations running things, and they're also not fighting an asymmetrical war against the largest super power in the world.

5144,"&gt; As one can understand, these transactions use EUR, not CZK. We're extremely open economy, and every 0.1% of exchange rate fluctuation hits hard.

I would argue that any company doing a significant amount of import or export hedge against fluctuations by locking the exchange rate. By doing so you basically eliminate the biggest uncertainties.

&gt;  I have an idea what ČNB did (no insides, it's fully official information): when CZK started to appreciate against EUR in November 2013, ČNB printed ~ 2 × 1012 CZK (around 80% of our GDP per year!) and bought EUR for this sum. This devaluated CZK to 27 CZK per EUR and kept it this way for 4 years. Now the intervention has ended, and foreign players have this sum in CZK on their hands. 

The CNB did intervene to stop the CZK from getting too strong. But like you said that policy was abandoned and the [CNB now follows an inflation target which can be described as normal and more aligned with other central banks](https://www.cnb.cz/en/monetary_policy/inflation_targeting.html#c2). 



The third parties are looking at the actions from the central bank though, so while the central bank doesn't directly control it, there are certainly some influence. In the end the thing that matters is the inflation and whether the CNB and ECB are hiking their rates. 

While i can understand your worries about the exchange rate, i don't see how you can claim that the CZK is somehow unstable. Compare your currency to for example the TRY or ISK (that was mentioned by OP) and it is incredibly stable. Heck, compare it to my own NOK and it is way more stable yet we do just fine.

I knew you'd love those, especially the second one!

&gt;All I'm seeing is tired old talking points and examples of priming (which you've been doing as well).

Do you expect to see innovation on reddit? Nearly everyone's recycling the same tired talking points, but we still don't call them all trolls because of it.

&gt;Pointing out facts isn't the same as calling names, much as you might want the public at large to dismiss anyone pointing out right wing troll accounts when they try to dominate the conversation.

Nice projection, you're the one attempting to dismiss viewpoints by labelling them as trolls. So far, your ""facts"" are that he's a troll because... his ideas weren't new enough? No - you simply don't like what he's saying. He argued cordially, whereas you dived in and attacked. The only one who should be dismissed here is you for the lowering the discussion, it's too bad I enjoy this too much to resist.

&gt;No, he's a troll because it's literally a fucking 2 day old account with a posting history that's exclusively him either pushing a far right narrative or just insulting people.

The age of the account is irrelevant. Maybe he's only on reddit to debate politics, and he happens to be right-wing? Is that so unbelievable? Hell, it sums me up pretty well too (I also debate football sometimes).

&gt;Way to poison the well by referring to it as 'mass' immigration. In reality, those studies actually show that either the majority has positive views of immigration, or that they are at worst neutral about it. It is only when poisoning the well that you can manipulate the results into giving the false impression that most Europeans hold the same xenophobic attitudes as you do.

Mass immigration is what we're facing in Europe. It'd be disingenuous to phrase it any differently. I understand why you want to move the goalposts though - if we're talking about what's acceptable to most people, then mass immigration is _reeeally_ not a side you want to be defending. Very convenient that you'd ignore the rise of the right across the continent too. Just keep telling yourself it doesn't exist and that all right-wingers are just reddit trolls.

Of course it is, but is it on the same magnitude morally  or threat wise compared to terrorism? I'd argue terrorism is a greater threat because of the political nature. Like, school shooters don't have a greater mission of killing infidels or sharia law. *Also even if it is a serious problem, it's not related.* Separate issues, Europe doesn't have gun violence, but a lot more radicalized people towards jihad.


&gt;any religion could be used like that, it's false to assume that Islam is so special in this regard, people can be brainwashed by Christianity just as much

No, because Christianity went through the reformation, which Islam did not. The only ""secular,"" muslim country is Turkey. And we all know how that is working out.

I don't like this 1% vs 99% argument where it gets boiled down to technically ya both are bad, but one is much worse.

&gt; it's just that most of the Christian world is very stable in comparison and doesn't have terrorist organizations running things, and they're also not fighting an asymmetrical war against the largest super power in the world. It's war.

Many terror attacks in Europe are people not from warzones. Like Morocco or Somalia. I wouldn't just dismiss the ideological factor simply because they're poor. Lots of countries are poor, the only thing that seems to be the connection between terrorism is Islam.

My main point is that there are people who are being improperly labeled as intolerant by the left so the left could justify being intolerant to them.

People who complain about shit like in OP are being labeled as bigots even though they're not homophobic. People who fight against the lie that gender pay gap is due to sexism are being accused of being sexist.

5202,"&gt; Yes it could be outside the EU but inside the CU and SM but that wouldn't satisfy almost anyone who voted leave.

People who voted leave will never be satisfied as they were promised unicorns, cakes, blackjack &amp; hookers. Not only its not going to happen but they are as many different wishes as there as brexit voters. The whole thing is a farce.

The EU is an union of 27 nations, working together by making the rule of laws the core of everything, it cannot bend to accomodate to this or that state, everytime it did it, with the UK or Switzerland, it only raised more problem in the long run than anything else.

So they are right now closing down all bespoke deals, opt-outs, a la carte billaterals agreements to unify everything to everyone to avoid loopholes and taxes evasion.

Ofc the UK expected to find some loophole and get some playfield advantage but it is not going to happens. And considering the madman in the white house, and the one in the Kremlin, this is the worst time since WWII for the UK to go solo.

&gt; You can't just dismiss what one side does not find acceptable and say the solution is workable and it doesn't matter if they don't like it.

5210,"&gt;You certainly haven't been in China long enough yet.

Yeah, I guess five years is too short. I haven't seen everything.
&gt;The way you describe the Chinese here is frankly distorted and caricatural at best for having lived and studied there and met many of them

Well, I did the same and of course met educated and cultured folk, but you gotta contrast it with the lots of assholes like the market vendors who charge you 3 times more than other Asians because you are white or the taxi driver who deliberately takes you the long route to the destination and have to make a scene so that you don't get ripped off. The spitting on the streets, the lack of self-awareness regarding smells/fumes/noise. It was really fun riding the train as a woman was gutting fish on the same wagon. I have loads of stories where, of course, I laugh recalling these memories, but these stories are the literal (perhaps anecdotal) evidences that China is not as civilized as Hong Kong.

Again, I loved living in China, but many foreigners are kept in a bubble of pink clouds and aren't aware of its obvious shortcomings and not realize how uncivilized it is.
&gt;I can't sadly say the same while I was in HK or specifically Shanghai...

So, it's your anecdotes against mine. Whatever fam, ask any native from Hong Kong and they'll tell you the same, China is not civilized like Hong Kong is.

I heard a similar thing about Taiwan, but that's just from my dad. He said Taiwan used to be extremely peaceful and pleasant, until the Chinese from mainland started immigrating there. I don't know though in the case of Taiwan, but it doesn't take a genius to realize that Taiwanese are probably also more civilized than the Chinese, because they didn't promote the Cultural Revolution (in fact I think they had some kind of Renaissance in response).",Nem Tudom European,/r/europe/comments/8zwm57/how_156_years_of_british_rule_shaped_hong_kong/e2mknu9/,Leemour,1531947922

5217,"&gt; Yes, but they all agree Sharia (religious law) should be the law of the land; they just disagree what exactly constitutes it. That's the distinction. There is no Sharia in Christianity

Sharia is not a strict set of laws. Sharia in broadest terms means governance with Islamic discipline. I.E it's similar to a conservative American wanting USA to be governed with ""Christian values"".

We have had actual Sharia states you know, you can examine their laws which are well recorded. For example there was a single law in Ottoman Empire but it draw from both Islamic understanding and Imperial understanding, the resulting law was ""Sharia"".

The main difference is Islam has some more tangible procedures in its scripture, which lead to development of a legalist school of thought that attempts to draft law from Islamic principles. Even there though Orthodox Islam advised common sense and comparison (qiyas).

5267,"&gt; Neither does the US. In reality, the overwhelming majority of US spending on its military has nothing to do with ""defending the EU"". Thats why the whole base of this argument is rotten.

Your counter argument is a mute talking point as so long as all members are in honest going to commit to mutual defense then the ones who spend the most on capability will end up providing the most in an actual war. Combine that with German chronic underfunding to the point that Germany can only muster a handful of Eurofighters it is clear that the implication is that the US would be doing most of the heavy lifting.

&gt;The only time when article 5 of NATO was activated was in the case of 9/11, by the USA. As far as I remember, European NATO members dutifully came to the aid of the US in Afghanistan.

Fighting radicals armed with AK's is radically different than fighting against a near-peer (For Europe at least) nuclear armed foe. The US was more than capable of doing so alone but chose to for political reason in the spirit of cooperation. American contributions in the Balkans and in Libya at European request was substantial.

&gt;They would be, if Trump had not canceled TTIP.

As far as I am aware the TTIP did not offer any concessions because of US commitments and was all based on the US as an economic power. The point I was making was that one can have a free trade deal with Euro while not providing it's defense. 

&gt;The US isn't in the EU. It has no real influence in Europe or on Germany without the NATO.

Bullshit, look at the Iran sanctions. The EU and Germany wanted to continue to do business and have worked on policy to circumvent. That is inspite of the fact their NATO ally has been fighting increasingly escalating proxy wars against Iran with it's allies Israel and the KSA. However American economic dominance influenced businesses and independent actors to do what the US wanted anyways. The US has influence in being such a large consumer economy.

&gt;The US are very engaged in Global Trade. Without Global Trade, the US technology sector would be nothing. Without Global Trade, Americans living standard would be far lower.

False. Exports account for only ~10% of US GDP, the *least of any developed nation* and half of that is NAFTA. Compare that with Germany which exports are ~45% of GDP. The US doesn't need to defend global trade in order to continue existing as it is. Germany, on the other hand, *desperately* needs the US to continue to do so.",,/r/europe/comments/8ztlrl/why_die_for_montenegro_us_president_asks/e2ml4s1/,yabn5,1531948388

* The way that you are phasing out nuclear energy in favor of gas and oil from Russia and inefficient solar and wind power is just so... ungerman. The money spent on all the panels and windmills could have gone into safety research and waste disposal and recycling techniques for nuclear power plants. There's no greener technology than this. When you burn gas and oil and coal all the waste goes in the air. Nuclear waste is put in barrels and kept under very tight rules and regulations.
* The way actual war refugees from Ukraine were/are denied asylum. That's hardly fair. Seemed you needed to not be from Europe to be given asylum for a while there but I'm glad to see things are starting to change.
* The aforementioned pandering to Russia and buying their goods with one hand while motherly gesturing no-no to them with the other. Building huge pipelines so you can suck on that tit with even greater hunger. And don't tell me that they are economically dependent on the EU, that's hilarious. If you have a stove and i have the wood, which one of us is dependent on who? I can still burn the fucking wood while you stand there with your stove. Or I can just sell it to someone else.
* Germany has it's own interest. That comes before the EU and it always will and it's normal. National interests come before everything else. So you will always do what is most convenient to you first and everything else comes after. You don't really respect the power you wield in the EU because you don't really respect anyone around you. The entire eastern part of the EU resents your attitude and the fact that it has given rise to all sorts of duginist parties like Jobik in Hungary who is now firmly attached to Putin's cock.

This is not a good idea. Being from ""such an area"" (I can already hear the denigrating tone in your post as you type this up; us wicked Dutch rednecks and our terrible way of life), I can comfortably state that one of the most pressing reasons people vote far right is *because* Wilders is talking about the subject at all. Many of them blame politicians for failing to represent them when they refuse to address the topic at all or pretend there is no problem.

Just because Stef Blok hasn't personally had a negative experience, doesn't take away from the fact that an incredible amount of his constitutents have - and, being a minister, he should voice his opinion on what (if anything) he intends to do about it. The responsibility for politicians is to represent their people; not themselves.

True enough; instead of scapegoating, perhaps putting forth a plan and stating goals you mean to achieve with your policies are a better approach.

5383,"&gt; Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. My kingdom is not of this world. It's very much not the kind of religion that demands state power.

You do know that the Gospels are also part of Islam right? The Quran declares a large part of the new testament a corruption but specifically declares the Gospels as being a true revelation from God—apart from that that the text is super vague in an interpretation of ""separation of church and state"" and it certainly didn't stop the Romans itself from building a Christian theocracy and the same practice continuing for a looong time. The Vatican itself remains a theocracy to this day.

&gt; Having a state religion is different from religion mandating what the law, government structure, etc is going to bed. There is no Christian equivalent of Sharia. 

First off people act like Sharia is actually some book out there somewhere rather than a rather vague understanding; it's just law derived from Islamic holy sources which includes all of the old testament and the better part of the new testament as said. There was massive disagreement inside of Islam what exactly constitutes ""Sharia"" because hey those books are vague and contradict each other.

The Christian analogy of Sharia is just any law that is based upon Christian holy books and yes it exists of course.

&gt; There is no Christian equivalent of Caliph.

The many different popes?

&gt; This is a direct instruction not to have secular rule and make your own (earthly) laws but to govern according to religious text.

Yeah, and like I said Islam also accepts the Gospels as God's revelation which includes ""render onto Caesar what is Caesar's""; as I said these books are vague and contradict itself, for instance the bible also says:

&gt; Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.

—Romans 13:1-14 

You can find pretty much an argument in favour or against most things in these holy books. If you want to selectively quote you can find that the Christian religious canon wants theocracy and the Islamic canon does not and in reverse and that you so selectively quote here shows you just went searching for things that corroborate your view.",Dat is allemaal helemaal niet nodig hoor.,/r/europe/comments/8zvhga/peaceful_multicultural_societies_dont_exist_dutch/e2mcp4k/,Homoerotic_Theocracy,1531941301

The UK can either stay in the CU &amp; SM, let only NI in the CU &amp; SM or do exactly what they proposed with the technological solution but do that in the Irish sea. Problem solved, and they have until the end of 2021 to do it.

But it looks like they dont even believe in it themself. And refuse the backstop.

Risk the whole UK (65 millions people) for 1 million unionist in NI is utterly stupid. No functionning democracy in the world would allow a tiny part of its citizens to take hostage the whole nation. The UK have yet to apologie to have treated Ireland and catholics in NI like shit for centuries and the Brexit is yet another proof of their contempt for Ireland as not a single one of their politicians thought NI would become such an important issue.

The UK was the fatest growing economy of the G7 2 years ago, today it's the worst. So maybe they should just shallow their pride, admit it was a mistake and cancel the whole thing before screwing Ireland yet another time.

&gt;Senior sources in Brussels said, however, that the reluctance to speak out was due to the clear indication from the UK negotiating team that a full-blooded rejection of the paper would likely prove an existential threat to Theresa May’s premiership, and hasten the collapse of the talks.

Threaten to shot yourself in the head or to throw yourself in political chaos where nothing can be discussed is not a way The EU should accept any talks with anyone. If that is how the UK behave, give them no deal, let them tank to the bottom and they will end sending someone reasonable in a couple years.

Nothing 'happened' to them. I have no idea what you are talking about.

Everyone benefits from immigration. It has repeatedly been proven to be financially beneficial to a country, as well as reducing crime rates.

Also, you are assuming that everyone in London in an immigrant. This is not remotely the case. The majority of native-born Londoners also voted Remain and value immigration.

5423,"\&gt;be me, Romania

\&gt;get fucked at every corner of history by Russia

\&gt;their last fuckery in our country was with Mechel, who is owned by close friends of Putin. Mechel came in '00 i think and bought all the metal working factories (many of which had strategic value and defense contracts) from the corrupt, irresponsible state, promising record productions. In a couple of years they laid everybody off and demolished and scrapped ALL OF THEM. One of the factories had a one-of-a-kind rolling mill which was built in the 70's. There are documents that show that the CIA was ""worried"" about the really good efficiency of this mill, so you can see how valuable it was. This piece of equipment was taken and shipped to Russia and lo and behold a couple of years later, the Russian steel industry was growing by leaps and bounds. Mechel was opening factories in Russia left and right and equiping them with this technology. Meanwhile they were closing our factories and weeping and moaning about the crisis of '08 and the global market and increased production costs.

&gt;You seem to be afraid of Russia for some reason lol

Yes. Some reason.

&gt;Europe doesn't need to be afraid of them, especially with how muvh Russia relies on us economically

Yes we do have to. Their underhanded ways are just as destructive as open war. The result in my country is piles of rubble where strategic industry was before.

It is also not just myself that thinks that, however within my circle of acquaintances who care to talk about this stuff, we all feel the same way. 

I feel the US would be 100% ready to assist and defend, but for the obvious reasons of their own strategic interests and the very real likelihood that they would probably be under attack as well. Even if they were not, I still have no doubt that they would throw their might to our defence.

I also feel that the UK would 100% assist Canada due to the connection and bond we share.

I feel that other European countries and citizens would not want to see their own blood shed to defend Canada. I feel they would want peaceful solutions with a crimea like acceptance to any outcome.

NATO to me was a way to ensure European safety and an ease for North America to once again come to the aid and defence of Europeans. It was a good way to make sure that a coordinated defence is achieved and to remove any lag time between countries, but for the defence of European nations.

5568,"There are some people sent to jail over false accusations. But a quick search puts to bed your worries about this. Let's have a look:

&gt;since records began in 1989, in the US there are **only 52 cases** where men convicted of sexual assault were exonerated because it turned out they were falsely accused.  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, in the most detailed study ever conducted of sexual assault reports to police, undertaken for the British Home Office in the early 2000s, out of 216 complaints that were classified as false, only 126 had even gotten to the stage where the accuser lodged a formal complaint. Only 39 complainants named a suspect. Only six cases led to an arrest, and **only two led to charges being brought before they were ultimately deemed false**.   
&gt;  
&gt;[https://qz.com/980766/the-truth-about-false-rape-accusations/](https://qz.com/980766/the-truth-about-false-rape-accusations/)

The amounts are very small. Even 1 is too many. But the worries some seem to have about this are not based on reality.

Meanwhile, the amount of people who get away with actual rape and sexual assault are very high. We should not ignore that and laws like these help, even if only to sent the signal this is a serious issue and to help people step forward more.

&gt;Really? You think women can't abuse people? You think women don't use the tools available to abuse their victims, just like men do?  
&gt;  
&gt;What a misogynistic thing to say.

You did not even read my post, did you? Because otherwise you would have seen I talk about ""people"", not women. Which can be both men and women.

&gt;only 2.25% of reported rape accusations are determined to be true.

I’m Portuguese and lived in Brussels in 2006. During the World Cup that year we reached the semi-finals against France, so I made my way to a little Portuguese cafe to watch the match with the the rest of my diaspora. As it was normal, during those days, we lost the match, so I got drunk and made my home on foot...alone. Just me and my flag wrapped around my neck like a proudly disappointed Western European superman. 
Almost every single car that drove past me would shout something encouraging or applaude me. I say almost because the few ones driven by French people took the chance to mock me and then some Belgian fellow would appear by the window and tell the French to get fucked. People in their balconies smoking a cigarette, others leaving a restaurant, a series of cars stopped at a red light and even one of the drivers got out just to give me a hug. Everyone who saw me and wasn’t French wanted to show their love.

5633,"The problem with discerning the 10% is that it's time consuming.  My general guide, as a person in the UK:

1. Check The Guardian.
2. Check The Telegraph. 

I tend to check the Guardian because even though their commentary section has a left-bias, their news articles are remarkably free from it. If something seems incongruous, then I check The Telegraph, since they're the second best newspaper. 

When it comes to statistics, you have your work cut out for you. For example, in the UK, black people make up 5% of the population but 13% of the current prison population. You'd be forgiven for thinking that it's simply more black people who commit more crime. 


You can literally just google why that is the case... but then you need to curate a sense of what a good source is. 

So lets look at these:

1. https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/12/15/a-mass-incarceration-mystery 

2. https://www.br***tbart.com/big-government/2017/04/16/how-federal-agencies-keep-americans-in-the-dark-about-crime-statistics/

Just going to point out, the second one is a convincing and detailed editorial on the surface.

1. The first site provides in depth discussion and backs up the discussion in it from a wide variety of sources. On top of this, we can see an edit with a timestamp where they have made and corrected a mistake. There is no clickbait, e.g. WHY ARE BLACK PEOPLE IN JAIL - Well 75% OF OFFICERS IN THIS SURVEY WERE RACIST RACISTPANTS. 

1B. When you click on to the 'about' section, there is a set of details for leaking stories safely, contact details and a Code of Ethics. In the Code of Ethics we see that they have high standards for their journalists and the website is founded by an esteemed lawyer.


2. Put out of mind that it's Breitbart. How can you tell that it isn't good quality discussion? Lets go through it quickly:

- They claim Obama pardoned 1.7k drug traffickers and violent felons, but in the article they 'source' it is revealed that Obama actually *pardoned* fewer people than almost any president. A mistake right off the bat.

- When they say that the president did something extremely positive, they offer no source or official White House document for looking at these policies. If a site simply says: x did a big policy change and you can't find it by googling, it tends to be BS.

- And the crux of the matter is pushing X as a negative and Y as a positive should get your back up because they're pushing an agenda. 

- Here we see more agenda pushing. Obama saying there isn't a crime wave is being linked to the 1700 criminals back in the streets. Watch out for hand waving language that makes you think things are linked, e.g. in some articles about the murder uptick, left wing sites are trying to suggest that it's due to the political climate. 

- When you google the people granted commuted sentences, you see that it's nearly all growing pot, bouncing checks one too many times and liquor law violations. Not 'deadly drugs'. Lying about easily checked facts is probably the easiest way to curate a source.  Making facts into EXTREME FACTS is another.

- Finally, because it's getting a bit dull - the overdose deaths. The majority of overdoses are from prescription opiates. There are no overdoses from marijuana, which was what was being pardoned.  They're using bad statistics to push an agenda. 

- There is no Code of Ethics, no way to contact the editor/writers and point out mistakes. There is a store where you can buy inflammatory merchandise. 

TLDR; a good website for statistics will link directly to the statistics and show that they have read and understood them.  There will be no needless drama, no hand waving to try and imply links where there are none. They will be openly accepting emails, complaints and corrections and have a clearly defined code of ethics.


Sources like Breitbart are really good at appearing similar to a good source. So usually I go straight for the code of ethics and google who owns the website. The latter is also good so you can consider their biases. ",,/r/europe/comments/8zszt4/a_croatian_family_walking_in_brussels/e2lmjhk/,RetardCat69,1531919261

5662,"&gt; Populist, saying whatever you will think will please the masses.

Populism: support for the concerns of ordinary people.

 Much like the Roman Populares: ""Concerned for the urban poor, the Populares supported laws regarding the provision of a grain dole for the poor by the state at a subsidized price. As such, they wanted reforms which helped the poor, particularly redistributing land for the poor to farm and debt relief. At times, the Populares also supported the extension of Roman citizenship to Rome's Italic allies.""

&gt;a) Broad political opinion is molded to the interests of others

This happens in politics regardless of ideology. It's necessary. People join politics because they desire to change their country, and in a democratic system you require a majority of people to agree with you. This is simply how it works.

*""Later, there came the loss of the spiritual unity of peoples, for as the system worked by achievement of majorities, every object that the system set itself to gain had to obtain a majority of the votes. And it had to obtain them by stealing them, if necessary, from the other parties; and for this reason it had to have no hesitation in calumniating them, in heaping upon them the vilest obloquies, in deliberately falsifying the truth, in not letting slip a single means of lying and vilification. And thus, fraternity being one of the postulates displayed before our eyes on the title-page of the Liberal State, there has never been a collective condition of life in which wronged men, at enmity one with another, have ever fell themselves less fraternal than in the turbulent and unpleasant life of the Liberal State.""*

&gt;b) you can't ask people to have an opinion on things they clearly dont know/ understand.

If people don't understand politics then should you let them vote? Elected politicians themselves don't fully understand economics, law, politics and etc. and yet they're expected to lead the nation. Take the British House of Commons for example. Let's say someone proposed a legislation regarding the provision of healthcare. Out of the ~600 people there, how many do you think are doctors or have had experience in the provision of healthcare?

&gt;I woldnt want my government to ask me to decide about the best infraestructure strategy for the next years, since I have no formation about this topics and hence cant have an opinion. I'd end up voting on my own prejudice rather than my own knowledge. Thats what populist do, create and feed of off prejudice.

That's exactly what politicians do. How many have had experience in infrastructure, having worked in transport and logistics for instance?

5881,"Homophobia is often rooted in disliking people who are different and don't fit in. It shares that with Islamophobia, also rooted in a hatred of anything foreign, different and weird. Gay people have a subculture, their own 'scene'. I don't see why Muslims shouldn't be allowed to have their own subculture within a Western country. Yes, the gay subculture is a choice too. And a lot of the discrimination against gays is rooted in the dislike of many gays' femininity or other non-conformist attitudes.



So what it comes down to is being consistent in approving of civil rights and non-discrimination: if we allow gays to have their own subculture, we should allow different migrant groups to keep their subculture as long as it fits certain norms that fit humans in general (e.g. don't kill, don't steal, look after eachother, etc). Most Muslims brilliantly follow these norms and should be accepted in society and not be discriminated against. People are allowed to have their own values (e.g. you're allowed to think homosexuality is a sin - aka no place for a thought police), you just shouldn't bring those values into practise (aka follow the law and certain social norms). 

By the way, I would also disagree with Islamists walking along such a march in a seperate group. Far-right Islam and far-right nationalism are of the same kind of cancer. ",,/r/europe/comments/8zsj0x/afd_youth_wing_furious_over_berlin_pride_parade/e2ldjo1/,Luc3121,1531905129

Is it any difrent in ""liberal"" democracies?

In those - opinion is molded to the interests of minorities.

&gt;you can't ask people to have an opinion on things they clearly dont know/ understand.

In specifications - of course not. But you **can** ask them about general direction they would like their country to evolve.

Take those unfortunate migrants for example.

The countries that refuse migrants tend to invest into ""pro family"" - ""pro procreation"" policies. Because it is obvious that generations need replacement.

Some countries decided to take more migrants - other - to encourage people to multiply more.

""The European Commission finding is the most consequential decision made in its eight-year antitrust battle with Google. People familiar with the case said the fine would significantly outstrip the €2.4 billion charge Brussels imposed on the company last year for favouring its own site in comparison shopping searches.

The decision takes aim at a core part of Google’s business strategy over the past decade, outlawing restrictions on its Android operating system that allegedly entrenched Google’s dominance in online search at a time when consumers were moving from desktop to mobile devices.""

And

""Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, has concluded Google used illegal “tying” methods to force phonemakers to pre-install Google services and apps, such as search and Chrome, as a condition of using Google Play, the smartphone app store.

Mobile operating networks and device manufacturers were also paid anti-competitive financial incentives if they pre-installed Google search and no other rival services, Ms Vestager has determined.

A third leg of the case relates to contractual restrictions that stopped manufacturers from selling phones using rival operating systems developed on the Android open source code.

Under such antitrust decisions, Google would be expected to end the illegal practices, forcing amendments to its operations that could have implications for its future standing in the market for mobile and other devices.""
