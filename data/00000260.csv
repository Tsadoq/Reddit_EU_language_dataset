18,"&gt; And what genocide? Seriously, nowadays everything is a genocide. Yes, a lot died but no where near enough. There were 1,5 million Albanians on Kosovo, 8.5k to 10k died. That's less than 1%. That's no genocide. I know numbers aren't all but clearly there was no intention either, if there was the death toll would be 10x higher.

I was referring to the Bosnian war. I said that ""several years prior"" Serbs conducted massive ethnic cleansing at the very least and genocide at the worst, and therefore Kosovars were not thrilled about remaining part of this state. 

&gt; And no, I wouldn't compare it to Germany. Germany lost a proper war, Russia hasn't. And Russia has a far more competent leader, and isn't dumb.

I would agree that Putin is more competent than Hitler, (because he has Hitler as a reference and knows what mistakes not to make, and how far he can push it), however I don't agree that Russia didn't lose a ""proper war"". The USSR literally disappeared like it was nothing. Not all wars are military conflicts, and USSR was weak, economically and politically, and therefore collapsed without a shot fired.  

&gt; Yes, it won. But things change. Power shifts. The west won't reign supreme forever. I doubt for long actually. All empires come and go. You make a nice list, but on the other hand you'd have Russia, China, Iran, NK, possibly India, Turkey, Latin America etc. It's far from being a done deal. Also, you have some big disagreements between the US and EU recently, and within the EU itself. All is possible.

The next stop is a full global government, which will in fact take some power away from the West, but it is not power shifting to another pole. The only pole in this unipolar world will remain the West. 

&gt; Russia won't join a west where it's expect to be beneath the US.

Of course it will be beneath US. We have USA, population 300 million, global presence, 20 trillion dollar economy, compared to Russia, 140 million people, 3 trillion dollar economy. You want Russia to be considered equal to this? Lol. What next, Serbia and Russia will be considered as equals?

&gt; Russia wants to have it's own sphere, it's own pole of this world, rather than having a unipolar US led world. And it's this that pisses the west off.

First of all it really doesn't piss the West off. Majority of Westerners are perfectly fine with what you are talking about(multipolarity) because they are stupid. They don't read history and this is why we keep repeating the same mistakes. Multipolarity is one of the most unstable atmospheres as it encourages conflict.

We can have either unipolarity like today, bipolarity like during the Cold War with USA vs USSR, or multipolarity, like before WW1 and WW2. Both those systems are less desirable then unipolarity. Also, if we give Russia its own pole, then there is no end to it. Other countries will want their own pole as well, so we can not compromise on the issue. 

There is only one planet, and if we are all to unite as humans, we can only have one pole. It can be federalized and localized (Imagine like a United States of the World), but it can not have multiple decision making centers which are equal. Otherwise there will be never ending rivalry and conflict.",,/r/europe/comments/88b8y6/eu_membership_of_serbia_depends_on_solving/dws1x6o/,Dr_Richard_Kimble1,1522820501

50,"&gt;Keep in mind, the Germans didn't actually stall until the start of 1943, and only had their operational advantage shift away to the Soviets after the battle of Kursk in mid 1943.

... I wonder how many lies and fabrications like this will I see in this topic. But lets get started - Germans lost strategic initiative in 1941 before operation Typhoon and operational initiative in 1942 when they managed to make empty cauldrons near Rostov and Millerovo, allowing russians to withdraw in good order. By 1943 Russians had literally anything they needed (I recommend reading through Vassilevskyi reports in late *1942* where he states that in 3 to 4 years German military will be incapacitated with or without WA help) to push their way to Berlin.

&gt;And no, the US did not enter the war at the end of 1941, they had been in it since 1937 when Japan invaded China. Mass supplying of the Allies, the use of it's navy, strong arming against Axis nations and reducing their trade partners, relieving the Allied forces in various places so they could concentrate on more active zones, etc.

No they werent active participant until 1941. 500 000 Springfield rifles which (according to Brooke) were not useable in combat conditions. Token military forces and garrisons (only place I can think off is Greenland)... Only useable thing delivered before 1942 were old destroyers.

&gt;The Soviets would have collapsed in 1943 had the US not been involved. Kursk need not to have occured, because all those machines that ground down the Axis advance would not have existed. The grindstone of American industry would be replaced by the whip of Slavic enslavement.

... so if US had not entered war, russians would not build 30 000+ T-34s, 3000 KV-1s tanks, ZiS 2/3/4 AT guns, their own 152/122mm artillery and their own mines by the time of Kursk, right?",,/r/europe/comments/88qpm2/is_this_dark_enough/dws2ove/,GrayFoxCZ,1522821728

But lets get started - Germans lost strategic initiative in 1941 before operation Typhoon and operational initiative in 1942 when they managed to make empty cauldrons near Rostov and Millerovo, allowing russians to withdraw in good order. By 1943 Russians had literally anything they needed (I recommend reading through Vassilevskyi reports in late 1942 where he states that in 3 to 4 years German military will be incapacitated with or without WA help) to push their way to Berlin.


If the Germans lost it in 1941 there would have been no Southern Offensive, no Kursk Offensive. The Soviets would have attacked at all times, not just when the roads froze and the German's equipment failed.


&gt;No they werent active participant until 1941.


They're navy was actively patrolling against Germany's Uboats from 1939.


&gt;500 000 Springfield rifles which (according to Brooke) were not useable in combat conditions.


Good ting they had millions of Garand rifles then.


&gt;Token military forces and garrisons (only place I can think off is Greenland)... Only useable thing delivered before 1942 were old destroyers.


Doesn't matter if you think it's ""token"", it's active participation. Doesn't matter if you think the ships are old, the Brits still had a deficit of hundreds of destroyers.


This is also forgetting the millions of arms shipments the US sent *bought* by Britain at 90% discounts.


&gt;... so if US had not entered war, russians would not build 30 000+ T-34s, 3000 KV-1s tanks, ZiS 2/3/4 AT guns, their own 152/122mm artillery and their own mines by the time of Kursk, right?


No, because 90% of their raw materiel sources were under occupation by the end of 1941. Doesn't matter if you have a million factories, without those US imports you cannot hope to feed them.",,/r/europe/comments/88qpm2/is_this_dark_enough/dws30rt/,TheBigOilySeaSnake,1522822282

Extensive research on all European Union countries has shown that 78 percent. Europeans are demanding more precise border controls. The research also shows that, according to respondents, Central European countries were better at coping with the migration crisis than Brussels.
The research was carried out in February by the Századvég Foundation. What is important and worth emphasizing, the survey was conducted in all European Union countries.

Douglas Murray from the British weekly Spectator stressed that the most unanimous for him is the unanimity of Europeans on this issue. ""While there are many political divisions in each of the 28 Member States, and there are significant differences between them, it is only a matter of migration, borders and security that do not separate them,"" says Murray.

Central Europe coped better with the crisis?
The survey also proves that almost 70 percent. the respondents are afraid of immigrants from Africa. Also 70 percent. European Union residents believe that the problem is the sudden increase in the number of Muslims in Europe. Only 8 percent. respondents said that immigration is not a problem.

**Most respondents believe that Central and Eastern European countries have dealt with the migration crisis better than Western European countries. Only 24 percent. respondents claim that Brussels has fulfilled these obligations better.**

The survey also shows that there are more people in every country surveyed who think that illegal immigration is a ""serious problem"" than those who say it is not a problem and those who think that it is not a serious problem.

But, okay, let's take that route.  Every state should be identical.  The EU makes some mechanism that renders location entirely-irrelevant.

The article seems to feel that Puigdemont has been badly treated.  Is this gonna do him any favors?

I bet not.  Because he chose Belgium as the friendliest venue he could find.  His bitter complaints about being forced to be subject to the *German* process was that he was happily gaming the the system himself.  When he got greedy and entered another state, Spain moved, undermining his gaming of the system and ability to choose the most-favorable venue.

So:

* He was doing exactly what the article is accusing Spain of.

* He was doing it first.

* He had the ability to continue doing so, if he merely stayed in Belgium.  But he decided to try gambling on going elsewhere without risking losing Belgium's favorable take on the matter.

* And now there's an article complaining about uneven treatment across states, complaining that Puigdemont wasn't able to maximally-exploit this unevenness himself.

* It is highly-likely that ""smoothing"" out positions on the matter would not be favorable to Puigdemont.  He chose Brussels because it was the most-favorable place to be for him, not because it represented the center of European opinion on the matter.

To be blunt, whatever the merits of making the extradition process more even, trying to argue that it is needed because Puigdemont was mistreated by Spain seems like a decidedly-flawed argument.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/89d1u6/opinion_free_movement_threatened_if_european/dwrqny2/,vokegaf,1522807943

282,"&gt;A new law in Poland threatening the independence of its Supreme Court takes effect today. The law stirred such controversy following its adoption by the Polish parliament that the European Commission in Brussels launched a process to secure restoration of the rule of law.
&gt;
&gt;By reducing the age of retirement for Supreme Court justices, the law could force 40 percent to retire – a veritable judicial purge. This is one of many changes wreaking havoc on Poland’s courts, and, critics say, putting them more firmly under the control of Poland’s ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS).

This sounds familiar!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Procedures_Reform_Bill_of_1937

&gt;The Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937[1] (frequently called the ""court-packing plan"")[2] was a legislative initiative proposed by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to add more justices to the U.S. Supreme Court. Roosevelt's purpose was to obtain favorable rulings regarding New Deal legislation that the court had ruled unconstitutional.[3] The central provision of the bill would have granted the President power to appoint an additional Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court, up to a maximum of six, for every member of the court over the age of 70 years and 6 months.

-

&gt;Attorney General Cummings received novel advice from Princeton University professor Edward S. Corwin in a December 16, 1936 letter. Corwin had relayed an idea from Harvard University professor Arthur Holcombe, suggesting that Cummings tie the size of the Supreme Court's bench to the age of the justices since the popular view of the Court was critical of their age.[46] However, another related idea fortuitously presented itself to Cummings as he and his assistant Carl McFarland were finishing their collaborative history of the Justice Department, Federal justice: chapters in the history of justice and the Federal executive. An opinion written by Associate Justice McReynolds—one of Cumming's predecessors as Attorney General, under Woodrow Wilson—had made a proposal in 1914 which was highly relevant to Roosevelt's current Supreme Court troubles:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Judges of the United States Courts, at the age of 70, after having served 10 years, may retire upon full pay. In the past, many judges have availed themselves of this privilege. Some, however, have remained upon the bench long beyond the time that they are able to adequately discharge their duties, and in consequence the administration of justice has suffered.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I suggest an act providing that when any judge of a federal court below the Supreme Court fails to avail himself of the privilege of retiring now granted by law, that the President be required, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint another judge, who would preside over the affairs of the court and have precedence over the older one. This will insure at all times the presence of a judge sufficiently active to discharge promptly and adequately the duties of the court.[47]

Now, this was some serious bullshit from a constitutional standpoint.  FDR just wanted a Supreme Court that would rule that his legislation was constitutional.  But despite all this, FDR has remained probably the most popular US President, because the public basically wanted the (center-left) reforms that he was pushing at the time.  Well, and because World War II.  But, anyway.

This never actually went through.  FDR couldn't sell the public on supporting it — mucking with the Constitution was bad news.  But it's interesting to point out that he intended to do so, had every intention of doing exactly what PiS is.

&gt;Capital of the world in research

Totally false, several countries outdo the US in innovation and scientific research:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-22/south-korea-tops-global-innovation-ranking-again-as-u-s-falls

When you take into account relative sizes of countries, Scandanavian countries demolish us in groundbreaking research:

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/countries-nobel-prize-winners-per-capita/

The only time the US is #1 is when you’re an idiot and forget to take into account population by looking at total research output. But when you do that, China is #2, showing how utterly meaningless that number is since most of what China does is produce fraudulent papers and garbage research. 

&gt;patents

Absolutely, unequivocally false:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Intellectual_Property_Indicators?wprov=sfti1

Not only is the US not anywhere near #1 in patents per capita, but it’s not even #1 overall. South Korea has over 5 times as many patent applications per capita as the US. We utter dog shit compared to them when it comes to patents. 

&gt;like 17 or 18 of the top 20 universities world wide.

Glossing over the fact that top universities is a poor measure of anything relating to a country at large, that number is completely wrong anyway:

https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2018

Only 11 of the top 20 are American, not “like 17 or 18”. Not to mention the huge fraction of professors at those universities doing all that top research who are foreigners. And entire third of them didn’t even do their undergraduate in the US:

https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/one-in-three-top-us-professors-educated-overseas-study-finds

And again, the large population of the US inflates these numbers. A larger country will necessarily have more schools. On a per capita basis, the US is nowhere close to the top.

311,"&gt; Il partenone era già stato manomesso e rifunzionalizzato in chiesa cristiana nel 608.

e allora? lo so che era stato trasformato in chiesa. Non e' certo un caso isolato. Il Pantheon a Roma, il tempio della Concordia ad Agrigento, la cattedrale di Siracusa, etc si sono salvati per il medesimo motivo. Anzi, dargli una destinazione d'uso corrente li ha salvati dall'incuria. E gli Ottomani per un periodo trasformarono il Partenone in moschea. 

Cio' non toglie che gli Ottomani abbiano avuto poca cura del patrimonio preesistente. Quanta parte della Costantinopoli antica e' giunta fino a noi? Meno che a Roma. E questo anche solo considerando gli edifici civili.

&gt; Inoltre le decorazioni furono quasi tutte distrutte da greci cristiani, quelle che si sono salvate è stato per puro culo.

L'esplosione che danneggio' gravemente il Partenone e' del 1688. Se consideri che era stata riconvertita da 1000 anni e che Lord Elgin si porto' via una gran quantita' dei marmi di Fidia 100 anni dopo, dubito che ci siano arrivati per puro caso.

I don't think the people you argue against *want* that either, but they probably don't want people advocating for ""alternative medicine"" to treat cancer either, or for people to advocate for climate change denial. The climate change deniers have the potential to end up resulting in the deaths of far more people than a group of German neo-Nazis tbh. and the ""alternative medicine"" group results in plenty of deaths every single year.

But that doesn't mean that the fix is to ban it. They will still think the same nonsense and will still talk about it etc. The only difference is that you'll pay for a bit of jail time for some of them now and then.

The reason why people shouldn't believe in ""master race"" nonsense or the horseshit peddling alternative medicine folks should be education and evidence. That's the only way you may actually *change* their opinions, a ban will never ever do that. At best it'll only make them think that you have something to hide.

We're talking also about pieces that you can even lift with one hand. Many pieces were put in the wrong place, others are completely missing and are being reconstructed (with much whiter marble so that the viewer knows what is original and what is not, from the same quarry that the original marble came from), they substitute the wooden pegs and joints that connected the pieces of the columns and the other pieces of the structure (and the rusting iron ones from the previous restoration attempts) with titanium, oh, and so much more.

345,"&gt; The legality of the invasion of 2002/2003 is still debated to this day

Only in the US and to some degree the UK, due to having been part of the ""coalition of the willing"". But even 14 years ago, mere months after the invasion started, Kofi Annan publicly stated that invasion is a breach of the UN's founding charter and illegal: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/16/iraq.iraq

It's not bad to get it wrong, what's bad is if you can't man up and take responsibility for having gotten it wrong.

2003 was when the US lost a lot of goodwill from the international community, triggering the biggest global peace protests in human history, a fact sadly many US Americans seem completely oblivious about to this day.

&gt; Furthermore, it was akin to the opening chess move where knight covers pawn as ICC was (still is?) utilized for political gain.

So what is it now? ""personal policing measure"" or a ""political gain move""? And why ""cover the pawn ICC"" if nothing about that invasion was illegal? No matter how you want to frame it, the timing on this is not only bad, it's quite obvious.

&gt; You'll have to provide evidence of extrajudicial killings and state-run blacksites. I've heard them being operated on foreign soil (looking at Poland) but never under the direction of CIA or MI6.

Evidence for extrajudicial killings? Are you living in some kind of bubble? Or maybe you just don't realize that drone strikes are exactly that: http://drones.pitchinteractive.com/

And of course blacksites are mostly operated on foreign soil to bypass US laws, it's exactly for that reason why Guantanamo is in Guantanamo and not in Brooklyn.

The mere fact that you have the audacity to ask for ""evidence"" for these clearly established practices either suggests you want to troll me or you have **a** **lot** of news and information reading to catch up on.


&gt; While I agree the Iraq war lead to an unfortunate power struggle, Islamic terrorism has been alive and well since the Soviet Invasions of Afghanistan back on the 60s/70s. 

The statistics for this ""War on Terror"" paint a completely different picture: http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/globe/index.html

Feel free to browse from 2002 to today and witness the success of the ""War on Terror"". Spoileralert: No success, quite the opposite just like with the notorious ""War on Drugs"".

397,"&gt; As if independence could only be achieved by claiming ownership over Transylvania as a whole disregarding the will of others.

Just like Hungary disregarded the fact that Hungarians are a minority in Transilvania and yet they held it, disregarding the Romanian majority? If it was ok for Hungarians while in minority in Transilvania, then even more so for Romanians.

&gt; Besides both the Hungarian society and the Hungarian government was finally open to have two sided negotiations.

You mean after Hungary lost WW1? Because before that, in [Treaty of Bucharest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Bucharest_(1918)) 

&gt; Romania had to give Austria-Hungary control of the passes of the Carpathian Mountains

Looks like Hungary was very happy to have Transilvania when it looked like they will win. Spoils of war, but only for them. God forbid Romania should do the same at the end of the war, when Romania was on the winning side and Hungary defeated.

&gt; The Hungarian army was not defeated, when the government chose to retreat and disarm them in order for peace talk agreements.

If you're referring to WW1, neither was Romania when we signed that treaty. In both cases it would have been just a matter of time and saved lives on both sides. A good decision. And just like Romania had to accept heavy conditions, I don't see why Hungary should receive sympathy for some stretch of land where Hungarians were majority in Transylvania (a portion of it, in most of Transylvania Romanians were the majority)

&gt; The Hungarian government even provided trains for the Romanian delegates of Alba Iulia.

source? I'm actually curious and want to read about this.

&gt; Bottom line is, Hungarians had no responsibility over how nasty the story turned out to be.

Hungary couldn't stomach the fact that is not a great power anymore, didn't manage so much territory and so many ethnicities that didn't want to be ruled by Hunagrians. So yeah, they are responsible.

This rule can be empirically confirmed by linguistic history of Italy, Germany were local dialects still have significant role. Counter examples are Russia and France were political centralization was achieved relatively early and local dialects are almost gone already. By extrapolating this rule for thousand years back we get situation where every village and hamlet had its own dialect or language. In some places for example in Dagestan (Caucasus) even today neighboring villages (auls) populated by autochthonous people speak almost mutually unintelligible languages because for very long time they were isolated in small valleys from any significant external influence.

456,"Mmmmm... I have read and re-read the Wiki article of the EAW and my Spanish article written by the Spanish Law professor.

The EAW has its limits and the crime of rebellion is not the list of crimes where double criminality is not needed for extradition, but it also does not fall under the list of conditions where Germany **must** or **may** refuse extradition, so at least the German judge is forced to study it and not automatically dismiss it or approve it.

Now, here is where my Spanish Professor mentions Article 20, section 4 of the ""Ley de reconocimiento mutuo de resoluciones penales en la Unión Europea"" (Law of mutual acknowledgement of judicial resolutions in the EU), [pdf here](https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2014/11/21/pdfs/BOE-A-2014-12029.pdf). That section says:

&gt;Cuando la orden o resolución judicial que se reciba castigue un hecho tipificado como  un  delito  distinto  de  los  previstos  en  este  artículo,  su  reconocimiento  y  ejecución  podrán supeditarse al cumplimiento del requisito de la doble tipificación, siempre que se cumplan  las  condiciones  exigidas  por  la  Ley  para  cada  instrumento  de reconocimiento  mutuo.

Which can roughly be translated to:

&gt; When the judicial order or resolution that is received punishes a fact defined as crime different from the ones predicted* on this article, its acknowledgement and execution could be subordinated to the fulfillment of the double criminality requisite, as long as the conditions required by the Law are fulfilled by each instrument of mutual acknowledgement.

(*Those crimes are the ones from the EAW list where extradition does not need double criminality).

So if my non-expert interpretation is correct, when the crime is not on the EAW list and can't be refused, then dual criminality is king. And yes, you are right, the job of the German judiciary system is not to judge Puigdemont for his (alleged) crimes, but to consider if Section 81 of the German Criminal Law is comparable to [Article 472](http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Penal/lo10-1995.l2t21.html) of Spain's Criminal Law.

You would have to be incredibly naive to not conclude that they are similar and comparable, and the defence made by the independentists that ""violence is needed"" to be considered high treason or rebellion is weak, incredibly weak. The Spanish resolutions made by Llarena are very clear, and I hope the German judge does not fail into laziness, like some politicians and journalists have done.

The independentists, and Puigdemont in particular, are now political pariahs and the situation is a hot potato that is now overcooked and nobody wants. The German judge will probably fall in favour of Spain (like Germany's state prosecutors have already done) and let us deal with him already.",,/r/europe/comments/89bnxl/german_prosecutors_ask_court_to_permit_puigdemont/dwr90vz/,Versec,1522792048

517,"&gt;the thing is there's no need for sacrifice

There is the need to redistribute (public) resources. I have some experience in business management, and I am fully aware the existing debt for an infrastructure company is not an issue, and it has nothing to do with efficiency and labor cost.

&gt;force employees into terrible conditions

Conditions most workers in the private sector would consider *standard* or even attractive.

&gt;Macroeconomically, the whole mass sacrifice ideology also does poorly as if you contract purchasing power you will slow down economic activity.

And on which sound economic theory is this statement based?

Yes.

I agree with them. Obviously the US/Canada is nothing like Nazi Germany but it was (a very small) part of what they did to brainwash children/adults so they do have that in common. 

They also did something similar in my country during Franco's regime. I don't think making children pledge allegiance to any concept they can barely understand is a good thing, let alone a flag that can potentially stand for anything. 

To an adult the US flag might represent certain values like freedom of speech or religious tolerance, to a child it's just a void that can be filled with anything when the moment is opportune.",,/r/europe/comments/890vi1/when_you_visit_europe_and_they_ask_where_youre/dwqz29c/,ReddSquall,1522784254

&gt;On Wednesday evening, 7 February, a debate was dedicated to the shrinking space of civil society at the European Parliament’s plenary session in Strasbourg. During the debate, a number of parliamentarians and the EU commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality highlighted the need for a so-called **European Values Instrument**, a fund to support non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Europe against national government policies to hamper their work. 

&gt;The late Wednesday evening plenary debate in Strasbourg showed that MEPs across the political spectrum are concerned about governments' serious attempts to discredit and delegitimise critical NGOs. This is particularly true of the governments in Poland, Hungary and Romania.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Silverstein

&gt;Thomas Edward Silverstein (born February 4, 1952) is an American convicted murderer. He has been incarcerated continuously since 1977 and has been convicted of four separate murders while imprisoned, one of which was overturned.[1] He has been in solitary confinement since 1983, when he killed prison guard Merle Clutts at the Marion Penitentiary in Illinois. Prison authorities describe him as a brutal killer and a former leader of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang. Silverstein maintains that the dehumanizing conditions inside the prison system contributed to the three murders he committed. He was held ""in a specially designed cell"" in what is called ""Range 13"" at ADX Florence federal penitentiary in Colorado.[2] He is currently the longest-held prisoner in solitary confinement within the Bureau of Prisons.[3]

-

&gt;Following the murder of Clutts, Silverstein was transferred to the United States Penitentiary, Atlanta, where he was placed in solitary confinement. His security status was recorded as ""no human contact.""

-

&gt;Silverstein claims that ""no human contact” status is essentially a form of torture reserved for those who kill correctional officers. ""When an inmate kills a guard, he must be punished,"" a Bureau of Prisons official told author Pete Earley. ""We can’t execute Silverstein, so we have no choice but to make his life a living hell. Otherwise other inmates will kill guards too. There has to be some supreme punishment. Every convict knows what Silverstein is going through. We want them to realize that if they cross the same line that he did, they will pay a heavy price.""",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/890d8r/15_εκ_άνθρωποι_στις_φυλακές_της_ευρώπης_prison/dwqpysp/,vokegaf,1522777228

&gt;He said establishing its origin required ""other inputs"", some of them intelligence-based, **that the Government has access too.**

So just because the chief exec from Porton Down doesn't have the same access that the government does, *does not mean* that they don't have proof. 

He's *proved* it's Novichok. Exactly what was required of him, and means that the actual intelligence services can do their job to prove its Russia as the origin, something they have seemingly convinced every major power of because they *clearly* have a comprehensive case.

Of course the Russian propaganda machine will run with this and create an entirely false turn of events and twisted statements. 

Edit: I should say he’s *proved* it’s **military grade Novichok** meaning that it *must* have come from a chemical weapons laboratory that has great experience and expertise in producing it. I.E. well.. you get the idea.

To me this is core to the entire idea.

War and conflict has been the norm on this continent, the EU is the absolute exception - and it lead most of us alive today to believe it actually represents the norm.

If we don't get this to work peacefully between multiple languages, cultures and interests, then it likely will take a while until someone else has the courage for a similarly ambitious project somewhere else.

670,"&gt;  I am sure they're glad the government took the gains and socialized the losses aka passed them on to everyone else.

This is not exactly honest. A lot of these gains were passed down to the citizens. Real wages in Greece increased more than in almost any other country in Europe due to the Euro. The government overspending also went, in large parts, to the government employees and citizens in the form of pensions and other benefits. 

You are also missing this: The Euro wasn't the sole factor in this. The mismanagement of the Greek government caused this mess, not the Euro by itself. Sure, the euro played a role and it would have worked out for Greece if they hadn't entered the Euro, but if you want to reap the benfits (which they did), you need to adapt. 

&gt; I mean you can't ignore situations such as people committing suicide in Greece because they got shafted by their governments.

The suicide rate in Greece is still far below the european average.

In particular, saying ""SNCF will be run like a private company"", does not mean that SNCF will be privatized. It does not mean that it will follow the regulations of private companies (why would it? It's still public!). What it does mean is that the way it will be run shares features with how a private company is run. That is what the word **like** means.

For instance, SNCF will have to compete with private companies. Despite being a public company. Also, despite being a public company it can not receive state subsidies that would affect said competition. Therefore, despite being a public company, the company must either

a) run like a public company, with all the associated costs (extra benefits like lower age for retiring, more vacation, ...). As competing companies don't have the extra obligations, they can charge significantly less than SNCF. Given the choice between paying significantly more to travel with SNCF, and significantly less for traveling with competing companies, most people would pick the latter. This leads to less money for SNCF, ever increasing ticket prices to compensate (as it is also not possible to lay off staff due to the above-mentioned public-sector-like working conditions). Eventually the company goes bancrupt as it is unable to compete.

b) run **like** a private company, with private-sector like work contracts. As this leads to costs similar to competing companies, prices are lowered, and SNCF is able to continue operating also in the future.

Note how **like** does not in any way imply that SCNF needs to be regulated like a private company (like you seem to think), or that it is somehow ""formally"" a private company (an even more bizarre impression).",,/r/europe/comments/89b1ov/french_sncf_rail_strike_to_defy_macron_labour/dwq8taa/,redderoo,1522762542

975,"&gt; It can be argued that Russia ""seceded"" from the Soviet Union too, like Yeltsin tried to argue. But that's not really what happened. A regime change doesn't break succession. Modern day France is still the successor state of the Kingdom of France despite having a revolution.

Succession is not continuation. Russia expressly accepted and retained all the rights and responsibilities of the USSR. Turkey had to affirm all treaties it became party to and set its borders from scratch. It did not inherit anything from the empire besides a portion of its debt (which the other successor states paid as well), the caliphate which was almost immediately abolished and the portion of territory it was established on. The successor states of the USSR are all its former constituent republics. Only Russia is directly bound by the treaties signed by the USSR.

&gt; There was no one else to inherit the legal person of the Ottoman Empire, so therefore that position was inherited by Turkey.

By what legal basis? Show us what you're talking about. Where is the proof of this inheritance?

&gt; You're not really making any legal arguments either.

I have, I showed how Russia took over the entire Soviet mantle and has since been bound by all its actions, whereas Turkey never had such status.

&gt; Then what is it a comparison in? I don't understand what point you're trying to make. The League of Nations in 1920 is not at all equivalent to the UN in 1991.

you must be insane to believe that. first, he is the head of a religious cult. his followers are nothing more than cult members. No cult is harmless, they are all dangerous and they should be eradicated by all means. 

There are two major terrorist organisations threat to Turkey. One of them is PKK. While I don't approve their methods at all, I can sympathize with kurds asking for recognition of their culture and language, I understand what drives their movement and I am aware that their identity has been oppressed for so long by state. and I can even support autonomy to a degree. 

The other one is Gulenists. Anybody who studied for University Entrance Exams before 2013 knows what kind of disgusting humanoids they are. they were untouchable back then. Erdo and Gulen were best buddies, even though they are sworn enemies now. Gulen's influence had it's roots in our education system. I personally know a police officer from my neigbourhood who openly admitted that questions and answers were given to them for Academy exams by their ""teachers"" in FEM school back then. I don't know where he is now, though. Gulen was designated as a terrorist even before AKP, that's why he escaped to USA and called it a 'voluntary exile'. They literally stole our future. 

I definitely want another peace process to begin and succeed this time to dissolve PKK and put an end to this conflict, they should be able to come back to the society and live their lives normally. but for Gulenists, I wish every single one of them an agonizing, slow, and VERY painful death.

Same goes for Autonomy, that's a big part of feodalism and Normandy wasn't a special case, it was even considered to be very integrated into the Kingdom compared to the County of Toulouse.   

As for France not existing as a nation-state you're both right and wrong, there was no feeling that all the people in France shared a common destiny until the end of the Hundred Year War, but among the noble there was definitely a feeling of peerness among themselves and a distinction between nobles of the Kingdom and Foreigners.   

The fact of the matter is that Guillaume spoke french, acted like any other french noble, was raised with a french education and considered other french nobles as his peers. The Norse who settled in Normandy weren't very numerous and they settled more than a hundred years before Guillaume was born.

1410,"Warning: I am unnaturally passionate about this

Pfft there is a national continuity between the frankish kingdom, and France, her successor state, which was named after them. This continuity manifests itself with brief interruptions (but never all at once) in the combined fields of geography and systems of power. No other claimants to Charlemagnes as a historical figure can make this case.

* Belgium's claim relies on assuming current geographical position and linking it to old historical claim, which is lousy when you consider that belgium was completely formed as a fractional state from the netherlands under foreign influence. It would be similar to say that Kant is russian since they are the current owners of Kaliningrad (ex Konigsberg)
* The german claim lays similarly on the fact that Charly conquered vast swathes of what would eventually become germany, and that the division of his empire would shape the average frontier between western and central europe for the millenia and a half to come. If it wasn't for the facts that the systems of power that Charly left in germany crumbled and changed lines offering no clear continuity and that germany was not formed by the influence of the lands conquered by Charly, but by Prussia which is completely outside of it's scope and denotes from more baltic influences than anything else, as well as the fact that the germanic lands in question were conquered for tops 30 years. If this is a metric to claim nationality then Napoleon (which by the way was not an italian national either) should count as half german because his work on the destruction of the HRE and the formation of the Reinbund and german nationalism was immensely more influential in the creation of the german state than anything else before and he did hold the same land for half the time and actually reformed it massively. This previous claim is in my salty opinion probably German attempt at seeking to find themselves historical root despite the concept of germany itself being a modern idea, and of course trying to avoid as much as possible the negative figures that they had.

I'll close by adding that ""germanic"" is a term invented by Romans to describe whatever type of ""Barbarian"" (read non roman from the north) they would encounter. Those kinds of populaces migrated and diversified immensely after the fall of rome and if you wanna get murky and look at ""germanic"" haplogroups, you'll find more of them proportionally in France and Spain and Ireland that in actual Germany, so this drops any kind of ethnic claim which I consider irrelevant in the first place.

If we concentrate on a cultural claim, although first of all it's completely useless to talk about language because every small village in europe had it's own language adapted from local customs and whatever, however the language of government and church since 500 AD is and was always LATIN. This is the big difference between proper old germanic stuff and actual frankish. The frankish language is a mix between pig latin and frankonian (which is the old original language of the franks from before charlemagne that did stay in the areas), in any case. The language Charlemagne spoke is Latin, which is why he was called Carolus Magnus and not Karl Den Grosse like germans horribly like to bastardize it in order to appropriate it.

Last remark on nationality, it is obvious Charlemagnes can not be considered a frenchman, the concept of nationality does simply not go that far back. However Charly is indeed the grandfather of France and with a strength that none other can claim, not the heirs of the most unholy, least roman, least carolingian, falsely named empire.

The city was also located on the Douro river, which stretches all the way westward and empties into the Atlantic, which presumably made it far more easier to travel to and had more trade routes.

Legion X appears to be stationed at Segeda, which the Romans occupied after destroying the town, and who’s near the Ebro river, that connects to the Mediterranean, and thus easy to travel to.

1454,"""Austerity"" refers to tax increases, as well as spending cuts to eliminate or reduce budget deficit. [Research shows](http://www.nber.org/reporter/2015number3/alesina.html) that the former is quite detrimental during an economic downturn, while spending cuts actually have very mild effects, or are not significantly correlated with any negative economic consequences, even during recessions.

&gt;. First, expenditure-based adjustments, namely those based upon cutting spending and not raising taxes, or relying less on tax increases than on spending cuts, were found to be much less costly in terms of output losses than tax-based approaches. Second, expenditure-based adjustments accompanied by an appropriate set of related policies can sometimes be expansionary, even in the short run. 

And further for newer research:

&gt;Our main finding is that fiscal adjustments based upon cuts in spending are much less costly, in terms of output losses, than those based upon tax increases. Over our estimation period (1981-2007), the output effect of an average TB adjustment plan with an initial size of one percent of GDP is a cumulative contraction in GDP of two to three percent in the following three years.12 In contrast, spending-based adjustments generate very small recessions, with an impact on output growth not significantly different from zero. As an example, Figure 1 shows the large differences between the effects of a one percent reduction of deficits implemented through an EB plan (in blue) and a TB plan (in black) in Canada. The effect on output growth of EB plans is indistinguishable from zero for about two years and then becomes significantly positive, while TB adjustments lead to deep recessions. The component of aggregate demand which seems to explain these differences in all countries, not only Canada, is investment, which is correlated with investor confidence. 

And:

&gt;
Overall, our findings suggest that major fiscal adjustments based upon cuts in government consumption, excluding transfers, are much less costly than tax-based fiscal adjustments in terms of foregone output growth. In fact, cuts in government consumption seem to have virtually no costs in terms of output losses on average–a result which probably balances some recessionary and some expansionary cases. Tax-based fiscal adjustments are very costly in terms of output losses. Cuts in government transfers seem to lie somewhere in between the extremes of government consumption and tax increases, though they are closer to tax hikes.

1509,"&gt; That is actually demonstrably not true if you look at crime rates in the USA.

But you said yourself, America has a higher crime rate than Europe. And even if you account for minorities, you still have a higher crime rate. Therefore it must be guns. Or maybe not and Americans are just more violent.

&gt; It wouldn't make as big of a difference because Europe is more homogeneous. And I don't think the crime rate would be higher, just the murder rate.

But you just said the crime rate in Europe significantly raised because of immigrants. So do minorities matter but also not matter for the crime or murder rate? Is Europe homogeneous and also suffering a rise of crime because of a wave of immigrants at the same time? That makes no sense. Stop contradicting your own words.

&gt; Once again, demonstrably not true as there is no correlation between gun ownership and crime or murder rate. Now I await your response where you either use gun deaths, gun murders, and/or compare the USA to a cherry picked group of 85%+ white/japanese nations.

But that's different from what's going on here.  I wouldn't expect that the Russian Foreign Ministry generally buys into at least the majority of these (I'd say ""doesn't buy into any"", but I don't have a comprehensive list of everything that this has happened on and I don't know how far back it goes).  However, they do make the claim.  So this is statement without belief, whereas projection is belief possibly without a statement.

That's their primary function of republics and what keeps leaders in check, supposedly. 

&gt;The monarchy functions as figureheads that unites a country and acts as guardians of the country's culture and heritage, living reminders of the people and events that shaped the country into what it is today.

Great in one way but it's not ""sporty"", I'd like to say, meaning it can't be as dynamic in function regarding geopolitical and technological changes. 

That said, I almost wished we had a monarchical figurehead, a national mascot basically. Though we do have famous historical figures like Washington and Lincoln who almost serve the same purpose as a mascot and reminder of our foundational ideals.

False. There are Americans who are not indebted after university and/or medical costs.

This is a naive viewpoint. It assumes that regulations are by nature rational and beneficial.

Care to link them for us? Literally the only place where I've saw that being reported is The Daily Star.

Only information I've found regarding China and the Skripal case:

&gt;China on Tuesday called on Russia and the UK to solve the spy poisoning case through investigation and dialogue, and urged relevant countries to give up confrontation after Western countries expelled Russian diplomats in response to a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Salisbury, England.

&gt;""China has been closely following the case, and firmly opposes the use of chemical weapons,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily briefing on Tuesday. ""But we believed that the case should be dealt with based on facts and through conversation between Russia and the UK.""

&gt;""We believed that relevant countries should abandon the Cold War mentality and give up confrontation to maintain global peace and stability,"" she said.

1705,"I don't think that this is accurate — I think that this is exasperation talking.  Russia's diplomatic service is not a collection of two-year-olds.

They will have made decisions about what public positions to take.

This statement came out, what, a couple weeks after the initial accusation?  You could go back and build a timeline showing delay between the initial accusation and the mirrored one.  It's not people simply unable to form any sort of other statement and grabbing for the first thing to hand.

When, say, [whataboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism) is used — a different tactic, though also a boilerplate way to respond to a criticism — it's a mechanism in rhetoric — you aim to deflect discussion away from the issue at hand onto something that the diplomat would prefer to have the discussion about.

This will have some sort of similar basis.  I don't know whether it's for domestic or foreign purposes.  It doesn't seem to be incredibly effective to me, but just because I don't find it personally very convincing doesn't mean that it doesn't achieve whatever the intended effect is.

For example, it's possible that the typical person really isn't familiar with any of the details of the issue at hand, can't really evaluate how plausible an accusation is, and that the aim is more to simply turn the dispute into one where bringing up the issue in one's mind doesn't bring up a ""oh, that's something that one side did wrong"" sort of memory — just a lot of conflicting accusations on both sides.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/88zvsc/poisoned_exukraine_leader_warns_of_russias/dwovczc/,vokegaf,1522697847

1756,"**Qwant, the French search engine that takes advantage of the Facebook case**

The tricolor search engine, whose model is based on the non-use of personal data, benefits from the turmoil of the Cambridge Analytica case.

The setbacks of Facebook are the happiness of Qwant. The French search engine that promises Internet users not to exploit their personal data is experiencing an unprecedented affluence since the beginning of the Cambridge Analytica affair that plunged Facebook into turmoil. Awareness of the misuse of data from some 50 million social network users by a UK company driving Donald Trump's digital campaign has pushed people to look for more privacy- friendly solutions . 

The founders of the search engine observe a sharp increase in the number of users in recent days. ""We went from 20% growth per month in February to more than 18% a day this week,"" says Eric Leandri, CEO of the company, at RTL Futur. Qwant had 58 million users in January. The company claims 73 million so far and hopes to exceed 100 million next month. It has treated as many requests as Google in two days last year and deals with it five times today. Its robots index a billion and a half web pages so far against 200 million last year.

**A model opposite to that of Facebook and Google**

Launched in 2013 by Jean Manuel-Rozan, financier, and Eric Léandri, security specialist, Qwant presents himself as a champion of the protection of personal data. The service assures Internet users that their personal information is not collected when they perform searches. When an individual searches for the application, the query remains anonymous. It is not personalized, does not result in a recommendation or targeted advertising. A model opposite to the one defended by Google who built his fortune on the exploitation of personal information.

Qwant regularly raises awareness of the importance of ""privacy by design"" , the protection of privacy from the design of the product. The platform uses its own architecture to rely on cloud services offered by the US giants Amazon or IBM, major aggregators of data. This model has certain limitations. On Wednesday, Qwant suffered the biggest blackout in its history . The search engine remained inaccessible for more than three hours while upgrade operations were conducted on the infrastructure to ensure service availability in the event of a failure or overload.

**Issues in the news**

Qwant earns money through a system of sponsored links and some partnerships established with platforms like TripAdvisor, Ebay or LeGuide. Advertisements are targeted based on queries made in real time. If a user clicks on one of these links or buys a service from a partner site, the search engine pockets a small commission. Once the operation is completed, the data is erased and the user is not followed by marketing tools during the subsequent browsing on the Internet. 

Also present in Germany, Spain and Italy, Qwant sees its development slowed by the hegemony of Apple and Google whose search engines are installed by default in Safari and Chrome browsers on their own products. In the meantime, Qwant is nesting at the mercy of scandals involving the giants of the Web. The setting up of the European Regulation on Personal Data on May 25 will also popularize some of the principles defended by society, such as ""privacy by design"". 

Meanwhile, Qwant launched Qwant Junior on Tuesday, a mobile app that allows kids to surf more securely on the Internet with an algorithm that censors violent, pornographic, conspiracy or radical content.

There are background checks in the US too, and you have to take tests. Most people in the US don't walk around with guns tucked in their waistbands. Wherever you're hearing that from is exaggerating.

1866,"&gt; Ofcource it does, hell I love paying taxes. I was provided with good and affordable education. When I had no job they helped me hold my shit together while I worked on finding one. When I was 2 months on a sick leave they provided me with a good healthcare and job security. I had to visit 6 different doctors and drunk shitload of meds, all in all I spent less than 50$. This is a society that cares about its members and helps them get back on track so they can in return contribute back to it. I want this kind of security for my friends and family, and I do not care if someone else might benefit from it accidentaly, since I know I do. 

You could have all those things without having to pay high taxes. No one is stopping you from donating to charities or helping others. Where as there is no reason to force someone into paying taxes they don't believe in. You don't have empathy because you redistribute the wealth of others.

&gt;I will trade this sense of security over metal toy any day.

When was the last time your nation tried an ethnic cleansing? The US government has a bad history of attacking those who cannot own guns.


&gt;It looks like you have never been down on your luck, which I am happy to hear, but you never know when it might happen to you or your family. I would prefer knowing that they have something to rely on in case I am not here or avaiable to help. Helping people when they are down is the best way to get rid of these ""lazy leeches"" and improve the system.

1886,"&gt; The countries that make up the union still have a lot of freedom when it comes to writing laws. Case in point where I live abortion is still illegal despite it being pretty much a legal right elsewhere in the EU. 

I could not stand having to follow Canadian or Mexican laws.

&gt;The migrant issue is a pint of contention among us as well, but it's mostly because of the detention laws and how the border states are worst affected by it since they have to care for the migrants themselves, and the south of Europe isn't in the best possible financial state. There's no doubt that those laws need rewriting. 

To make sure less migrants are taken in by member states that don't want them. I suggest every country make a system to send all migrants to Canada.

&gt;As for the taxes, that money is redistributed for the benefit of Europe.

This is where Americans differ from you.

&gt; At its best it can raise the economy of a country and this is supported by data, since joining the EU every state that became a member saw an increase in its GDP. This includes states that give to the union more than they receive in aid such as Germany, France and the UK.

And then you have places like Greece where they just take money from the EU and don't pay taxes.

&gt;If your issue is because you believe every country is an island that should live and die on its own merits alone then nothing I say will change your mind. For us though, the European experiment seems to be working and I can confidently say that the majority of us would like it to succeed. Can it do better? Of course, but on the whole most countries are better off as part of the union then out of it.

I despise the idea of having to live under the laws of a foreign government. In America we hardly tolerate our own government

Swiss bankers’ hopes for EU access dashed by Brexit

Technical talks about encouraging cross-border business have become ‘very political’



April 2, 2018 10:47 am by Ralph Atkins and Laura Noonan in Zurich

Swiss bankers’ hopes of securing improved access to EU markets have been dashed by Britain’s plans to quit the bloc, the head of Switzerland’s banking association has said.

Herbert Scheidt, said Brexit had politicised technical talks about encouraging business across the Swiss-EU border. “It makes it harder to improve market access at the speed we had hoped before Brexit,” the chairman of the Swiss Bankers Association told the Financial Times.

Despite being surrounded by EU countries, Switzerland has repeatedly chosen not to join the bloc. Instead, economic and other relationships are governed by more than 120 bilateral contracts agreed over decades.

Brussels fears any concessions given now to Switzerland could set a precedent for the Brexit talks, bankers in Zurich believe. “The EU cannot grant Switzerland something while still negotiating with the UK,” said one.

Mr Scheidt said: “What has changed is the overall political environment. Brussels is currently very Brexit-centred, people have little time for topics related to Swiss banking.”

Switzerland is the world’s largest manager of cross-border wealth, but its bankers’ direct access to potential clients in EU markets is restricted — although larger banks especially can circumvent the constraints by having units located in EU countries.

A longstanding ambition of the affluent Alpine state had been to improve access via a financial services agreement, but that goal was quietly dropped from Switzerland’s negotiating objectives earlier this year.

Before agreeing new market access deals, Brussels wants Switzerland to reorganise its EU relationships around an “institutional framework” agreement by which Swiss rules would change automatically in line with EU changes, and disputes would be resolved via mechanisms involving the EU judges.

Such plans are controversial in Switzerland, however, where voters reject the jurisdiction of “foreign judges”.

To increase the pressure on Bern, the EU last December dealt a blow to the Swiss stock exchange by announcing it would allow European and Swiss equities traders access to each others’ markets for just 12 months, leaving unclear what would happen after that. Bern denounced that move by Brussels as “unacceptable” discrimination.

“It was a very short term decision,” Mr Scheidt said. “We have heard that it was because negotiations on an institutional framework had not moved forward — but that was never mentioned when we were in Brussels in late October, shortly before the decision.”

Another potential flashpoint is access for Switzerland’s alternative investment fund managers. Fund managers had hoped the Swiss regulatory regime would be declared “equivalent” to the EU’s Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, which would allow Swiss-based asset managers to sell directly into the EU.

But in light of Brexit, the EU was “looking at how they deal with investment funds going forward”, said August Benz, head of private banking and asset management at the SBA. “The message for us has been ‘we have to look at this in a wider context’,” rather than finalising specific equivalence topics such as AIFMD.

Mr Scheidt added: “It has become a very political process.”

While the consequences of not having access to the EU market might be greatest for smaller companies without an EU presence, full market access would make it “more convenient for everybody”, Mr Scheidt said.

Mr Scheidt said a full financial services deal between Switzerland remained a “strategic option”.

Asked if such a proposed deal had become a casualty of Brexit, Mr Scheidt replied: “Brexit always enters the discussions — it is going to change Europe. But it did not have a specific impact [on the discussions of a financial services agreement] . . . You have to look at the whole picture of what is politically feasible.”

You massively undervalue manpower, the destruction of the 6th Army destroyed one of Germany's best and most experienced fighting forces it was almost impossible to replace it which they never could so afterwards the Eastern Front just became a series of slow retreats until Berlin was taken.

















&gt;It is also interesting that when Russia discusses WW2 they only discuss Europe. The US kept the Japanese pressure off of the Soviet far east allowing them to not have to protect their eastern flank. Were Japan to have struck Russia it would have been a repeat of the Russo Japanese War.





























That's because Japan signed a neutrality pact with the USSR after a disastrous land campaign against the Russians in which they [lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_border_conflicts) so even without US intervention the Japanese were not going to attack the Ussr their manpower was tied down fighting the Chinese.































&gt;The fact is, regardless of relative troop losses, without the US the Allies were done.

When did that happen? What Europe does not react well to is when the US is demanding other countries go just as balls-deep with their military spending as the US does. Do you want to keep US world hegemony? Well though luck, then it's up to you to do that.

&gt; I'm an American and think it's a waste of money to have bases in Europe and everyother country. 

I'm a German and I couldn't agree more, especially considering that the vast majority of ""host nations"" for US military bases are subsidizing these US military installations with taxpayer money.

Japan, Germany and Korea, paying billions every year to maintain foreign military bases in their own countries [0]. Which does not even account for the lost value by having military installations take up space in these very densely populated nations.

Honestly, hearing an apparent countryman say “speak for yourself” in response to my original comment was downright infuriating.

The idea that an American *actually* believes that we should limit freedoms so that the government may protect us is truly confusing. Our entire societal structure is based upon the principal of individualism. 

I’m sure the non-Americans will laugh at me saying so,  but the creeping socialism, globalism, statism in our country today is truly cause for alarm. If some of these people had it their way, we would have no firearms for personal protection, we’d be arrested for free speech, we’d be using the same currency as dozens of other countries, and we would therefore be operating completely contrary to what this country is about.

The Europeans can laugh at our guns and free speech and distain for socialism and suspicion toward the government all they want. I’d rather be laughed at by Europeans than completely forfeit our sovereignty like some of these countries have done so voluntarily.

few countries in Europe had to fight for that luxurious life you enjoy in Europe.

And even more ironically, you know what is only thing necessary for you to suddenly get why spending few minutes of your beloved entertainment show to stand the fuck up and thank people who did much,much more than that for you is... enough people thinking like you.

Even if Sweden would not hand him over, that is essentially meaningless. 

You clearly do not know or appreciate the meaning of the fact that tens and hundreds people have been kidnapped by the CIA from the streets of various European cities over the last nearly 20 years then subjected to extraordinary rendition for indefinite periods of time. 

Ironically, you might have known that if you had actually followed the information WikiLeaks has been releasing. 

Even worse, the US president now has the authority to order the assassination of US citizens abroad with no legal justification whatsoever, and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and every-coastal-liberal's-darling Barak Obama actually did that on numerous occasions (including on children). 

And Assange isn't even an US citizen...

2574,"Well, I don't know what the response is yet.

Russia does have a right to conduct exercises there.  This is Latvia's EEZ, not her territorial waters.  Technically, Latvia doesn't have to shut them down (but, obviously, looking at MH17, planes would be at risk).  Same as Russia can fly bombers through our ADIZ, as long as she doesn't enter our territorial waters.

I mean, we can go conduct a major naval exercise just over 12 nautical miles from St. Petersburg, advise Russia not to fly Russian aircraft through as it might be dangerous to their health, duplicate what Russia is doing, but I don't think that it is likely to be much of a deterrent.

If this is a method to harass countries and one that the world can live without, I'd favor a treaty restricting military exercises in some way, not just whacking Russia outside of law when she's annoying.  Because if it's an issue now, it can be an issue down the road.

Also, I'd prefer to understand what Russia is up to.  Russia's taken a couple of provocative acts recently.  The Skripal assassination on British soil, done with a banned chemical weapon, acting pretty rudely in response, and now this.  So my assumption is that she's aiming to provoke a response.  I'd assumed that it was related to the elections (and I'd guess that the UK thought the same thing, since she waited until the elections were over for any major response), but obviously it isn't.  If Russia's trying to get us to do something, I'd like to know what it is, because I likely don't want to do it.

One possibility *could* be trying to get us to take threatening military action so that it's possible to say, in domestic politics, ""Reject the West, they wish to attack you"".  I assume that it is desire to avoid that that led the UK to take actions that specifically would target the people running the show in Moscow.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/88vvxv/russia_to_test_fire_missiles_through_latvian/dwns5cs/,vokegaf,1522642054

2723,"”Lots in fact.” Not when compared with the US. France and Norway are in the top 10, it’s bad to use that fact to mislead people into thinking there’s lots of guns in Europe, without providing the statistics. 


The truth is that there’s 31.3 guns per 100 residents in Norway, 31.2 guns per 100 residents in France, while there’s 101 guns per 100 residents in the US; meaning that you can put Norway and France together, add another Norway, plus 6 more guns for every 100 residents, and then you have the same amount of guns as the US. If you’re gonna prove a point don’t use misleading statistics. 


No 1 in the world is the US, with more than one gun per person. The 2nd country is Serbia in Europe with 58.21 guns per 100 residents, which really isn’t weird considering all of the wars in the 1990s, yet it’s still near half of what the US has. The 3rd is a country in the middle east. The 4th is another European country, Cyprus, with 36.4 guns per 100 residents. Norway and France comes in at 8 and 9. The average for European countries range between 15-25 guns per 100 residents. 101% in America, 15-25% in Europe. There’s in fact not a lot of guns in Europe in comparison with America. 


Edit: just to add; It’s very hard to get a gun in Sweden atleast. I’ve known 3-4 people with guns, and those guns were strictly for hunting. In Sweden you need to be 18 and have been a member of a shooting club for atleast 6 months or have passed the hunter examination. When you get the gun, you can only use it for hunting or when you’re at a shooting range; it’s illegal for every citizen no matter if you have a license or not to carry your firearm with you and there are very strict rules for when you need to transport your firearm. This might still seem easy, but keep in mind that Sweden is 27 in the world with 21 guns per 100 residents, so it’s on the high end of the European countries. I’m not too familiar with how to aquire guns in other European countries, but due to the fact that Sweden is still pretty high on the list, I imagine that there are similar rules and laws in other European countries. 


Edit2: Sources were requested, I find that the small arms survey of 2007 gives a general idea of what it looks like but it was released more than 10 years ago now, so there will inevitably be some changes. I also used ""Gun Control Legislation"" which is a more up to date estimate of how many guns there are in the US. It's been a while since I studied this so I couldn't track down all of my sources, but I figure that these two sources are the most important ones so I'll leave it with this for now.

They're far from real rifles, but you know, 13 year olds. We (me and my friends) kinda hoped in high school we'll get to shoot 'real' guns but the news that there's not enough time to have such trips due to a shittone of material to go through made us quite sad.

At least to a point where the help will be effective? Do you agree that there is some fostering of dependence going on in the socialized systems we have in place? Because I think there is a percentage of that that needs to be addressed and I think there needs to be a conversation about that the same way that there needs to be a conversation about how much CEOs earn and who earns what for what work.

&gt; Then again, there's an understandable difference between oppressing those who earn a lot, and simply raising their tax rates.

Yes there is. And I would be in favor of raising taxes on the super wealthy but I think we need to better define who gets put into what tax bracket because taxing people who earn $420,000 a year at 40% just the same as the people who earn 36 million a year is kinda screwy in my estimation. And we also all need to be aware and in full understanding of the precedents we set in setting limits on how much money people are allowed to earn.

2917,"Isn't it well-known that the EU is terrible at explaining what it even is and what it does? Which is why you have falling voter-turnout, also a rise in Euroskepticism in all sorts of EU countries, and the skeptic-arguments don't even make sense a lot of the time - but the people *buy into* them. Because: a) they don't know better; or b) they don't identify with EU, see all the ""but muh sovereignty"" fear-mongering (EU is something external, in this case an external threat). Or it's both a) and b).

Anyways. Most people everywhere are concerned with immediate issues in their lives - their paychecks and so on. Most also barely follow politics, even local-politics, much less the politics of something as distant and vague as the EU. 

And as for this sub, well... we'd have much less to talk about if there was no EU. For example, ""journalist and his girlfriend got murdered in Slovakia"". IF there was no such thing as the EU, my reaction to that would be somewhere up there with the same happening in Georgia or Thailand or whichever country doesn't really affect me. *However*, since EU exists, Slovakia has more importance for my country and me, even if it's still indirect.

So there's nothing puzzling in the fact that EU is a huge topic on this sub, and that the sub leans more towards EU-love, but all that doesn't say much about the average Joe's all over Europe who maybe can't even find half of the EU-countries on a map.",,/r/europe/comments/88sy7f/unironic_so_europeans_idea_of_an_april_fools_joke/dwn2ona/,[deleted],1522611490

That is basically what happened in soviet Russia (under the same attempted system as Venezuela). Civilians in a village were shot  and raped and beaten for being more prosperous in Russia based on the ""misguided policies by a dictatorship"" under very similar policies as have been implemented in Venezuela. The communist system creates a whole different type of ""genocide,"" a ""genocide"" of competent people based on the idea that if you are more prosperous that someone else, that means you took something from them, not that you were more competent or knowledgeable than them. It's based on a hatred, not for people of a different ethnicity, but for people who are more prosperous.

3275,"On the political stage rarely is the political ideology in these situations what is actually being fought for. What is being waged is a power struggle, a new regime. The people looking to take power are influenced and partnered up usually with another power, in this case Russia. So to get people to be willing to fight for the new regime change they have to create contrast, so they spin out propaganda to build support. 

For instance no one actually thinks the crusades was about spreading Christianity. I mean sure it was in some way, but ultimately it was about the church wanting to expand its influence and rule. So they mask it in religion to justify and mobilize the expansion of power for the elites. 

The Vietnam fight was no different. Russia was trying to expand their influence into new regions. And we couldn’t allow Russia to grow in power so we had to retaliate. It just so happens that America’s package also comes with a whole lot more freedom than what Russia was offering.

3344,"&gt;What?

Oh boy....

&gt;Education in international relations and/or international law. You very clearly don't have it.

From what I can tell your field knowledge boils down to if their excuse is good what they did is perfectly alright.

&gt;""Would be"" is a bs basis.

Fair.

&gt;The US invasion of Iraq is pretty much seen as illegal by everyone. The difference is that there is no international remorse for a dictator like Saddam Hussein and that the US didn't steal territory like Russia did.

Taking land didn't matter to the US, just taking control of the country and getting the currency in which the oil is sold back to the dollar.

&gt;Serbia deserved to bombed the shit out of. Most of the world agrees. Period.

And if your world boils down to NATO and a couple of other countries, then yes. But there's a world outside of that, you know?

&gt;Again, was it anything comparable? Did anyone but Serbs claim it was ethnic cleansing?

We killed more, no denying that, though we also had complete superiority and there were far more Albanians on Kosovo than Serbs. As for did anyone claim their action to be ethic cleansing, I'm guessing some did. Likely the same states that opposed the intervention. 

&gt;I didn't say it was black and white, but only the Serbian actions fulfilled the right for other countries to intervene.

And I'd say the Albanians actions would also warrant intervention. Terrorism, killings, ethnic cleansing, drug and organ trade, destruction of houses and monuments. A neutral force would have been a fair solution.

Also, they only intervened cause they wanted the Albanians to win. Again, if we were in NATO and in good standing with them they'd have backed us.

&gt;As far as we know, there was only on one side. You haven't provided me evidence of an international organization's position that the Albanians committed ethnic cleansing.

I love how you're playing dumb. You can so easily find out what they all did and make the conclusion yourself. 

&gt;""Could have"" is no reason to invade a place. Seeing what became of Ukraine, there is no reason to think there would have been anything like this in Crimea.

Fair, but I'm so certain you wouldn't have it Crimea. The Crimeans weren't too happy about the fall of Yanukovich, I don't think it would be as peaceful as think.

&gt;Dude, your own country and Russia are the biggest propaganda producers here...

Of course, you're gonna us the propagandist, I'd call you one in return. No real pointing going in circles.

&gt;The fact that there is fight for power in geopolitics doesn't mean that every action is a fight for power. Serbia just deserved to be bombed, it was not about dominance.

Cmon man, stop fooling yourself. NATO intervened out of the goodness of their hearts cause they felt so sorry for those Albanians? No one with half a brain believes that shit. Kinda interesting how nowadays Kosovo is a self proclaimed state backed by NATO with a pretty large military base there...

&gt;It didn't give any result. The UN and the Security Council have the obligation to act. It didn't. Ignoring it was the right thing to do and the UN Security Council and the ICJ agreed.

It did, that you couldn't intervene. So you bypassed it. The UNSC agreed that doing the opposite of what it said was good? Really?

&gt;For fuck's sake. It just pisses me off that a person with no clue about international law groups such conflicts together as ""those conflicts"". Yes I very much defend some of these actions.

So, you said you agree that Iraq was illegal, but I also got the impression you kinda defend it cause you think getting rid of Saddam was good. He was an asshole, but he was far better than the anarchy the currently have.

But you'd fully defend Libya? The destruction of it? All to prevent a new oil currency from being created, plus Sarkozy's covering up his election shit?

Or Syria, which has been turned into essentially a new Iraq?

&gt;No I don't defend the illegal Iraq War, although I feel no remorse for a dictator like Saddam Hussein.

Previous point.

&gt;Because that also wasn't for ""bombing who it pleases"". Iraq was a bloody totalitarian dictatorship, hence why the international community may have objected to the reasoning, but around 30 countries joined the fight and many others supported.

Wait, so now you're saying they invaded because they cared about toppling bloody dictators? Really dude? You fall for that?

&gt;I didn't say that. But even guilty angels don't deserve to be bombed if their crimes aren't horrible enough.

They deserve to be punished, which they weren't.

&gt;What?

The KLA actions speak for themselves.

&gt;Perhaps their crimes weren't as grave.

Well, then they get a lighter sentence, not walk free.

&gt;I trust the opinions of respectable international organizations in these issues.

So, you can't form your own opinions. Good to know.

3485,"Taco Bell tastes exactly like homemade (what we call) ""Mexican"" food though, only that it tastes kinda half-assed.

Usually people only say that ""yeah, I could make this at home and it would be better"" but there's *something* different about the food from when you make it at home, something to make the fast food ""special"" in a way. Taco Bell tastes exactly as if you made a tortilla at home and half-assed it. It's honestly really weird.

E: With ""Mexican"" food I mean the sort of stuff we make here in Finland at home that most people just call ""Mexican"". I don't think it's trying to even represent authentic Mexican food, but that's what people call it. If you take some ground beef and put that market bought ""Mexican spice mix"" stuff in there and the meat ends up very much like the one from Taco Bell.

3498,"&gt; Pretty sure that is an insult.

Mongrel is only an insult if you take offense to it. Most nations are some kind of mongrels anyway, the steppe just allows for mixing of more geographically distant populations. One could argue, that the opposite of mongrel, inbred, is a worse insult. 

&gt; and even Armenians (like Matthew of Edessa)

What's with the even? This is hardly surprising, Armenia is steppe adjacent.

&gt; Except there is more linkage between Turkic people than between Indo-Europeans I think.

This is a vague statement. What do you mean by linkage? Sounds a bit like wishful thinking to me.

&gt; Being Turkic is about language, anyone can be apart of the Turkic nation.

It's not just language though. In fact Iranic languages were used as the lingua franca in some of the earliest steppe confederations, though speakers of various Turkic languages were probably a majority. There was a consistent way of life centered around nomadic animal husbandry and horseback archery. There are also Tengri customs that are maintained to this day among many Islamic Turkic populations, including Turkey. My mother had both kırk banyosu and kurşun döktürme done to me as a child. Also some kinds of food are widespread among distant Turkic populations, such as [çiğ börek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebureki) and [mantı](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manti_(food))

Though I will grant you, that in this day and age --with modern technology replacing traditional ways of life, language is the biggest commonality.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/88k8sq/an_unhappy_wife_is_complaining_to_the_kadi/dwmdcle/,ictp42,1522576343

I think Option Three is the best, where the Serb enclave of Kosovo goes to Serbia and the rest of Kosovo joins Albania.

As Hitler himself said - ""Those who want to live, let them fight, and those who do not want to fight in this world of eternal struggle do not deserve to live.""

If you can harm someone and they can't resist you or be deemed worthy enough of a protection by the higher echelons of the Socially Darwinian hierarchy, then they deserve to be harmed.

I'm anti-forced circumcision myself, but according to what I've read there is some plausibility in it reducing some specific types on infections. They key is that the type of tissue the foreskin is, is more easily permeable to microbes than the normal ""shaft"" tissue, and thus cut penises have less of this easily permeable tissue to get infected through. I don't know any of the percentages, however, and I don't think this is anywhere close to an acceptable tradeoff.

Yes, that's how corruption works, covering things up. Or did you mean something else? 

The documented reality shows coverups everywhere. Sadly, people have a tendency to want to hide their illegal shit and some of them hold public offices. Whether that's child abuse, pedophilia, police violence, organized crime, drug trafficking, hazing, bullying, corruption, politics or something else. But naturally you don't much care for those. 

You might not even be aware of the existence of them because you are so desperately laser-focused on the sole thing that gets your pecker up.

4069,"&gt; Honest question: Why would you go to NY over London?

Because Brexit means that the UK will leave the Single Market and Customs Union, so it will inevitably reduce the ease of doing business between Europe and the UK. Until now, London was the obvious choice not just because of the size of the operations and relative economy of scale, but because the regulatory framework was the same across the EU, capitals and services could circulate between two member states with the same ease they could between two regions of France or Spain. Plus a host of other factors like absence of VISA requirements, etc.

With the added obstacles and inevitable regulatory divergence coming soon, Wall Street will become more competitive and companies in New York will surely offer better terms to European companies which choose it over London.

&gt; Is there a movement in the UK against polish shops?

No, there is a general hostility against EU immigrants, especially the ones from Eastern Europe, and the Polish shops are an easy giveaway of the number of Poles that immigrated into the UK since their accession to the EU.

4201,"Not every boy in the U.S. is circumcised, but, yes, non-Jews and non-Muslims make up the bulk. 

It varies a lot by region of the country and over time (see [this chart](https://timewellness.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/fig2-copy.jpg)) for rates from 1979 to 2010 by region. 

* Midwest: has had the highest rates and has pretty consistently hovered around 75% of all newborn boys being cut. 
* Northeast: has been slightly below that, hovering around 65%
* South: approximately 55% are cut
* West: has been noticeably lower and decreasing more so over time (where the majority of newborns have been left intact for the past three decades) and is now around 40%. 

That chart comes from [this report](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/circumcision_2013/Circumcision_2013.htm#table) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s National Center for Health Statistics. Key takeaways from that report:

&gt; Across the 32-year period from 1979 through 2010, the national rate of newborn circumcision declined 10% overall, from 64.5% to 58.3%. During this time, the overall percentage of newborns circumcised during their birth hospitalization was highest in 1981 at 64.9%, and lowest in 2007 at 55.4%.

It's been a ""tradition"" for so long that it's a difficult cycle to break. Hospitals push for it to collect more money, parents agree to it because they think it is beneficial, and no one wants to talk about it because no one wants to admit they mutilated their sons. There is hope for the future, though: whereas I grew up in a time where about 2/3 of boys were cut, nowadays only slightly more than 1/2 boys are cut. The overall trend is in the right direction, but, it varies a lot by U.S. State (I believe it is as low as 10% in Nevada and as high as 90% in West Virginia).",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7u2quh/iceland_mps_propose_a_ban_on_circumcision_of_boys/dtj0o7z/,coip,1517420386

4210,"&gt;After all, it is consentless genital mutilation done out of no real necessity, and it has its risks that unfortunately get actualized every now and then.

I agree with this sentiment; I think the root of our disagreement on risk assessment is that you focus on the elective nature of the procedure (i.e. the risk can be completely avoided) whereas I'm focusing on placing this risky action among other risky actions parents are permitted to take.

&gt;For me, this ultimately boils down to whether young children sustaining severe, possibly life-long genital injury every now and then, caused by an unnecessary act to which they never gave their consent, is an acceptable price of the society upholding a mere tradition.

I might take issue with your exact wording, but I won't attempt to deny the root of this argument: it is an elective procedure with risk that parents decide to administer to their children without their (adult) consent. I only think it should be tolerated because more harmful actions are tolerated (in my opinion rightly), not because I see it as inherently good. Circumcisions performed in US hospitals had complication rates lower than tonsillectomies--are we about to ban elective tonsillectomies for children?

&gt;Banning does not solve the problem but hides it. Even though I am against non-medical circumcisions, this aspect is something that needs to be discussed too.

I agree that it would force observant Muslims and Jews to either violate their beliefs or become criminals. My main argument for tolerating the practice is that it is not grossly or unduly harmful. In my view we do not ""tolerate"" views that we find inoffensive--we can only ""tolerate"" things we find unacceptable. I certainly find the risk of a medically unnecessary surgery for my child to be unacceptable, but I'm not prepared to ban the practice unless it can be shown to be grossly harmful.

(I picked the US due to the ubiquity of the procedure there) ",,/r/europe/comments/7u7lxd/ban_circumcision_for_boys_under18s_says_intact/dtj0qzb/,LegioVIFerrata,1517420457

Total rot, when presented with a population where a majority clamour for independence and a geographically concentrated minority have lobbied consistently for centuries for that to be suppressed the only democratic action is partition with independence for the majority and continued union for the area in which unionists are the local majority. Ireland knew that partition would be the likely price of independence, just as the Republic knew severing all ties to the Queen and commonwealth would likely delay the possibility of reconciliation and reunification. The truth is, we don't want NI. It isn't valuable, few of us go there. But if there is a unionist majority then we won't kick them out. It is the antidemocratic strain of Irish nationalism that dismisses the unionist majority in NI as a people who should be overridden rather than courted and reassured.

4226,"The foreskin is not a vestigial structure like Americans *majorly* misunderstand. It's not like a tiny hole in the earlobe. It's not like a shot. It's not like making your kid get a haircut.

What foreskin is most like, is something called the clitoral hood in women. Similar structures, on similar parts of the body. In fact that might not even do it justice, since the foreskin contains around 20,000 nerve endings (by comparison the *clitoris* contains 8,000). 

Infant/child circumcision is genital mutilation. Nothing less. If a new  study concluded that clitoral hood removal reduces infections, and hospitals started strapping girls onto tables and cutting off their clitoral hoods, what do you think would happen? People would lose their fucking minds. That's what. 

As an American I'm passionate about this cause, but the hypocrisy, double-standards, and ignorance surrounding it just makes me sick. The way our society treats boys is appalling. And it's on a systematic level. ""The men's rights movement isn't needed"" my ass. ""Body autonomy is a women's problem"" my ass.

And the nerve endings thing is silly. There are millions of men who live happy, sexual lives that have had circumcisions. There's even a famous AMA on here about a guy who had an elective circumcision and found sex was better. 

And both carry the risk of infection, both at the same rates. I have no idea why people crusade either way on this. Either one is perfectly fine, because either one is generally the same. 

The number of botched circumcisions is so low it's a statistical anomaly in any country this applies to. 

[This article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/circumcision-rates-declining-health-risks-rising-study-says/) cites a study that says the risks of circumcision outweigh the benefits 100 to 1. Not the least of them being a higher resistance to certain STIs such as AIDs.

No, mate. That's not a valid reason why you should have your child circumcised. You have absolutely no legitimacy to force your backward views upon your child, especially when your views involve such an invasive procedure on their genitals. It's their body and only they should be allowed to make that sort of decision.

The original post in this thread makes it pretty clear that circumcision can have long-lasting detrimental effects on someone's mental health.

You are completely delusional if you think you can make a point by comparing the circumcision of a child without consent, something which will **irreversibly** affect their sexuality, with irresponsible eating habits or lack of certain privileges you seem to be taking for granted.

There are [Jews who](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/jewish-and-uncircumcised/article686203/) [aren't circumcised](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/well/family/cutting-out-the-bris.html). The Jewish bible doesn't mention hell, just death and the grave, so I doubt Jews believe uncircumcised men go to hell.

Circumcision is [not mentioned in the Qur'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khitan_\(circumcision\)#Religious_sources), but is mentioned in some hadith:

&gt; Some hadith mentions circumcision in a list of practices known as fitra (acts considered to be of a refined person). Abu Hurayra, a companion of Muhammad, was quoted saying, ""Five things are fitra: circumcision, shaving pubic hair with a razor, trimming the mustache, paring one's nails and plucking the hair from one's armpits"" (reported in the hadiths of Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim). So, despite its absence from the Qur'an, it has been a religious custom from the beginning of Islam. However, there are other hadiths which do not name circumcision as part of the characteristics of fitra and yet another hadith which names ten characteristics, again without naming circumcision; in Sahih Muslim, Aisha is quoted ""The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Ten are the acts according to fitra: clipping the mustache, letting the beard grow, using toothpicks, snuffing water in the nose, cutting the nails, washing the finger joints, plucking the hair under the armpits, shaving pubic hair and cleaning one's private parts with water. The narrator said: I have forgotten the tenth, but it may have been rinsing the mouth."" Hence, the different hadiths do not correspond on whether circumcision is part of fitra or not.",,/r/europe/comments/7u7lxd/ban_circumcision_for_boys_under18s_says_intact/dtitmum/,sgmctabnxjs,1517413690

4441,"He isn't that wrong tbh

&gt;With the origin of Islam in the 7th century and its rapid spread in the Arabian peninsula and beyond, Jews (and many other people) came to be subject to the rule of Muslim rulers. The quality of the rule varied considerably in different periods, as did the attitudes of the rulers, government officials, clergy and general population to various subject peoples from time to time, which was reflected in their treatment of these subjects. Reuven Firestone says, ""negative assessments and even condemnation of prior religions and their adherents occur in all three scriptures of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.""[1] Scholars have studied and debated Muslim attitudes to, and treatment of, Jews in Islamic thought and societies throughout history.

&gt;Jerome Chanes,[45] Pinson, Rosenblatt,[46] Mark Cohen, Norman Stillman, Uri Avnery, M. Klien and Bernard Lewis argue that antisemitism in pre-modern Islam is rare, and did not emerge until modern times. Lewis argues that there is little sign any deep-rooted emotional hostility directed against Jews, or any other group, that can be characterized as antisemitism. There were, however, clearly negative attitudes, which were in part the ""normal"" feelings of a dominant group towards subject groups. More specifically, the contempt consisted of Muslim contempt for disbelievers.[80]

&gt;Antisemitism has increased in the Muslim world during modern times.[105] While Bernard Lewis and Uri Avnery date the increase in antisemitism to the establishment of Israel,[105] M. Klein suggests the antisemitism could have been present in the mid-19th century.[106]

&gt;Scholars point to European influence, including that of the Nazis (see below), and the establishment of Israel as the root causes for antisemitism.[105][106] Norman Stillman explains that increased European commercial, missionary and imperialist activities during the 19th and 20th centuries brought antisemitic ideas to the Muslim world. Initially these prejudices only found a reception among Arab Christians and were too foreign for any widespread acceptance among Muslims. However, with the rise of the Arab–Israeli conflict, European antisemitism began to gain acceptance in modern literature.[11]

And what, you think it's not excruciatingly painful and uncomfortable for infants? Because it is.

&gt; and bears much higher risk of complication. 

This just simply **is not true**. There is far more risk of complications with infant circumcision than with adult circumcisions. And that's not even getting into the fact that more than 90% of infants actually go into shock as a result of the procedure; many even get seizures. Oh... and it even alters brain development. 

None of which happens in adult circumcision.

However, on the other hand, the child has no say in it, and that could be considered inhumane and unethical.

Personally, I'm on the pro side of the debate, mainly because I see it the same way I see immunization and vaccination in infants, there could be potential risks involved, but in 97~99% of cases, it ends up only being a benefit in the long run.

Female circumsicion: ""It's barbaric, it serves no purpose other then rob a woman of her integral part of her self, it indoctrinates women into a subserviant role, it causes problems later in life, and men should just learn that every female vagina is beautifull. There should not even be female circumsicions in hospitals, or religious exemptions, because there is no need to ever, under any circumstances alter a female vagina of a child under the age of reason, because what? Are you some sicko that is into little kids?""

male circumsicion: ""It's modern, it's healthy, it makes masturbation without lube impossible and thus makes it easier to controll little boys, it ... come on, men and their uncircumsiced penises just look ridicullous. There should be a religious exemption for jews, and for christians, and for muslims, and even just for the fun of it. I mean, seriously, every penis is better looking, and healthier, and it looks better, and he will get teased if he is not circumsiced. It's not weird that I am thinking that much about my son's penis, mother knows best. ""

Ever wondered why some men seem kind of strange? Like, I don't know, they were greeted with pain and possibly no anesthetic? 

Simple solution. have two EMT's and two police people attend the ceremony. If there are complications, remove the clit and outer labia/ head of the penis of the person who signed for it under the same condition as the childs foreskin was removed, if possible by the same person. Handcuff them to the bed, rip the pants down, nailclipper, snip snip. Send videos to all their family. To prevent flight risks, simply place the person who signed for the circumsicion under narcosis with a police escort the second the ceremony starts. The sameperson who removed the foreskin and fails must then do the operation on them. 

That woud lead to people doing their own research, And so forth. It would certainly be still possible for the parents , if they had religious reasons to circumsice their child, to do so, but they better pick a competent doctor, and not some hick. Plus, practices like sucking the blood out of the wound of the infant with your mouth would die out immediatelly. And if you consider that you want to make a vacation in a  country where it is still legal, so you don't have to face the risks of getting this done to you, is a great way to start a conversation why you perhaps should not do this. 

After all, if it's an act of faith and religious significance, surely the parents would not mind putting their genitalia on the same line as they pull their childs. 

If it is indeeed possible without a risk, there should be no problem. After all, such a faithfull ceremony should be accompanied by just as big a show of faith from the parents, right? And if you have enough faith that your childs genitalia remain unharmed and fully functional, place your genitalia on the same line.

And indeed Fascism in Spain did come from Catholics, who were existentially threatened by rising Communist sentiment.

Just because you were circumcised and are ok with it does not negate the following points:

* It's non-consensual
* It's non-reversible
* It's non-beneficial (in first world countries)

It may or may not decrease sexual pleasure. But it certainly will not enhance it. And in first world countries we are perfectly capable of cleaning our own members, and we don't suffer the same risk of AIDS that they do in other parts of the world where circumcision is practiced to prevent infection.

So even if you're proud of your lack of foreskin, I hope you can agree there's no reason to impose it forcibly on babies.

Edit: I should mention that, being a surgical procedure, complications sometimes arise during circumcision.

Unfortunately, what most people fail to realise is that, even if ritual circumcision is banned, it's rate of practice will be mostly unaffected. The religious extremists who truly believe that God necessitated circumcision will gladly take jail time in order to fulfil his will. 

I was raised Ultra-Orthodox Jewish and in school we were fed a constant stream of stories about Jewish 'heroes' in the Soviet Union that were sent to the gulag for having circumcised their children illegally. So, to me, it is not a question but a fact, that outlawing circumcision will not have much effect in reducing rates amongst the religious community.

However, I do believe that this is a major step in the right direction for society and I await the day that this barbaric ritual is outlawed around the world.

Edit 2: Just to make it crystal clear; I am massively in favour of outlawing non-medical circumcision. However, this will likely have little to no effect on actually reducing circumcision rates. If we want to truly end the barbarity, more will have to be done. ",,/r/europe/comments/7u7lxd/ban_circumcision_for_boys_under18s_says_intact/dtig5pi/,TheFriendlyFrog,1517392079

4732,"Number of your upvotes show the sad state of things.

You speak about Poland, Hungary and Czechia and leave out Slovakia. Hypocrisy... Whats so different for Slovakia?

That Slovakia wasnt so vocal about stupidity of immigration quotas? Or that Slovakia agreed to access some immigrant from quotas? Even though it ended with few tens? Or is there different reason? Slovakia is only one with Euro. Slovakia was also the country that refused to borrow money so it could give it to Greece

Western Europe is arrogant and doesnt want to understand each other positions. When Czech prime minister wanted to have actual pragmatic discussion about quotas it wasnt allowed. Even though later Czech arguments against quotas were agreed with by many politicians - even though official stances stayed the same...

Dont be surprised that central Europe is pissed with EU, when western countries scoff at central Europes problems (like lower quality goods for higher prices) while forcing its ideas on it by force in the same time.

You should get of your high horse. It was UKs and Frances decision that thrown central Europe under the bus before WW2 which ended with communist regime. I know its 80 years and that things are different with hindsight. But you should understand that this betrayal by our allies is what has shaped Czech and Slovak society and to lesser degree Polish and Hungarian. This betrayal just enforced the idea of not trusting anyone especially those in power. For your information Czechoslovakia had better economy than Italy between world wars.

I’m sorry but this is ridiculous. According to you conquest of ERE, the Eastern Roman Empire, country that created and was in essence Eastern Christianity and introducing domination of Turks and Islam there somehow strengthen Eastern Christianity?  By this logic the Reconquista strengthened Islam in Spain and if Crusaders would conquer Mecca and Medina slaughter inhabitants and convert all mosques into Christian churches that would strengthen Islam also. Ridiculous.

Turks ended ERE and Eastern Christianity is a shadow only, survived by extension in the Balkans and Russia.  Turks didn’t come to strengthen anyone but to conquer, kill, convert and make their own country and that’s what they did, as foreign invaders, nothing else.

4853,"Google Translate:

&gt;President Andrzej Duda signed the law on the prohibition of trade on Sunday. The new law will come into force from March. According to some experts and representatives of the trade sector, the bill is a sell that will be easy to get around.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for the wise, in my opinion, solution to this controversy - said the president just before signing the bill, referring to many doubts that appeared during the work on the new law. - Wise, because it does not prohibit trading immediately, because the ban is introduced in stages. Second of all, of course, the Act provides for a whole range of exemptions - said Andrzej Duda.
What are the changes?
&gt;
&gt;The ban on trade will be introduced gradually, this year the stores can be opened for two more Sundays a month - the first and the last one. And of course, there are Christmas Sundays. This is why, for example, in April this year, you can trade only on one Sunday - April 29.
&gt;
&gt;In addition, the law imposes that on Christmas Eve and on Saturday immediately before Easter trade will be possible only until 14.00.
&gt;
&gt;In 2019, shopping will only be done on the last Sunday of the month, and from 2020 stores will be closed almost all Sundays of the year.
&gt;
&gt;There is a fine for breaking the entrepreneur's ban - from 1,000 to 100,000 zł.
&gt;
&gt;Prohibition of trade after crossing
&gt;
&gt;This law has gone through a lot since it first came to the Sejm, as a civic project under the patronage of ""Solidarity"". It was in September 2016. Since then, the original idea has changed a lot, which did not please the trade unionists - although today their boss Piotr Duda, present during the exceptionally solemn signing of the bill, thanked the president for supporting the project. The goal remained the same: Sunday should be time spent with the family, not on shopping or at work.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, Solidarity goes further and now wants similar arrangements for employees in other industries.
&gt;
&gt;Exciting exceptions
&gt;
&gt;During the work on the act, the most emotions aroused by a number of exceptions from it - and this is still the case today, even though some of the holes were tried to be patched. There are exactly 32 exceptions in the Act, because not all places where trade is carried out will have to be closed. Exempted from the ban are, among others bakeries and pastry. This led to a discussion that such a provision would allow normal operations for stores that bake bread on the spot - for example, many discounters. The Senate added an amendment, which assumes that to avoid the ban, the ""overwhelming activity"" of such stores must rely on bread trade.
&gt;
&gt;Discussions also result in the exclusion from the ban on fuel stations . It is known that it sells not only fuel and other products related to the automotive industry, but also food, chemicals, toys and books. A lot of emotions were caused by the plans of PKN Orlen, which wants to expand its activity by wholesale. The company explained that it is not related to the ban on Sunday trading, but irrespective of intentions, it will not lose much on the new law, it will only gain.
&gt;
&gt;Trade on Sundays will also lead, among others, florists and souvenir and religious shops (similar to bakeries), news lounges, post offices, pharmacies, shops at railway stations, airports, free zones , in hospitals and prisons, and in the summer season - from June to September - points offering agricultural equipment. Normally, we will work on the purchase of vegetables, fruit, milk collection points, etc. We will do shopping without restrictions in small shops, provided that the owner and the machines are behind the counter .
&gt;
&gt;The Internet was also turned off from the prohibition . And it also, according to some, will allow stores to bypass regulations. There are voices that some stores, for example clothing or furniture, may consider opening branches on Sundays, but only converted into large exhibitions - showrooms. Trade will not be carried out in them, but after all, customers will be able to order it online after viewing the goods.
&gt;
&gt;Where did this idea come from? The Act does not explicitly state that stores are to be closed. ""Trade and trade related activities"" are prohibited in them.
&gt;
&gt;Excerpt from the Act on limiting trade on Sundays and public holidays and on certain other days Excerpt from the Act on limiting trade on Sundays and public holidays and on certain other days sejm.gov.pl
&gt;
&gt;The question is whether the ""advisory"" activity of employees of such showrooms will be a trade-related activity?
&gt;
&gt;Read more on this topic: How to deal with the ban on Sunday trading? The President of Top Secret throws a peculiar idea
&gt;
&gt;This is a rather peculiar idea, but the fact is that the networks will have to adapt to the new law somehow. Some of them benefit from the fact that Poles are eager to shop online - this is clearly visible in the clothing companies' results.
&gt;
&gt;An appeal for solidarity
&gt;
&gt;The President, at the solemn signing of the bill, appealed to employers to come to terms with understanding and ""as part of solidarity"". - I believe that in this way we restore normality, that we will just get used to it, as it is in other European Union countries - said Andrzej Duda.
&gt;
&gt;There are more unknowns
&gt;
&gt;Except for exceptions, there is more uncertainty about the new law. It is not known, for example, what will be the economic costs of this idea, how will customers behave - or will they shift their entire Sunday shopping to other days? If that happened, perhaps the stores would prolong the trade on Saturdays.
&gt;
&gt;Some of them will also have to deal with a smooth return to trade on Mondays, after the break. Biedronka and Lidl are considering introducing a ""night shift"", after midnight from Sunday to Monday.
&gt;
&gt;We have written more about it here: Biedronka is considering a night shift in stores. In the background of these plans, it is prohibited to trade on Sundays
&gt;
There are still so many uncertainties and doubts that probably many sellers will simply react to changes on a regular basis . Like the labor market. In recent months, retailers have been one of the most sought after employees. The networks announced increases, to stop the offenders and win new ones. Now it is not known whether and how one day of trading in the week will have less impact on employment.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7u6n5s/on_sunday_march_11_stores_will_be_closed_the/dtia5dq/,vokegaf,1517378923

&gt; The goal remained the same: Sunday should be time spent with the family, not on shopping or at work.

My guess, from a position of no expertise on Poland other than that this is Sunday and that Poland is relatively socially-conservative and religious, and PiS more so, is that this is a [blue law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_law):

&gt;Blue laws, also known as Sunday laws, are laws designed to restrict or ban some or all Sunday activities for religious reasons, particularly to promote the observance of a day of worship or rest. Blue laws may also restrict shopping or ban sale of certain items on specific days, most often on Sundays in the western world. Blue laws are enforced in parts of the United States and Canada as well as some European countries, particularly in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and Norway, keeping most stores closed on Sundays.
&gt;
&gt;In the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has held blue laws as constitutional numerous times, citing secular basis such as securing a day of rest for mail carriers,[1] as well as protecting workers and families, in turn contributing to societal stability and guaranteeing the free exercise of religion.[2][3][4] The origin of the blue laws also partially stems from religion, particularly the prohibition of Sabbath desecration in Christian Churches following the first-day Sabbatarian tradition. Both labour unions and trade associations have historically supported the legislation of blue laws.[2] Blue laws are technically classed[by whom?] as ""mala prohibita"" or ""wrong [as or because] prohibited"" (as opposed to ""mala in se"" or ""wrong or evil in itself""). Most blue laws have been repealed in the United States, although many states still ban the sale of alcoholic beverages or cars on Sundays.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7u6n5s/on_sunday_march_11_stores_will_be_closed_the/dtiaey8/,vokegaf,1517379365

4937,"&gt;Disputed by whom exactly? The WHO itself encourages. And the fact that adults undergo circumcision in less-developed areas confirms what I said. 

[The people who've been the targets of these interventions, for one.](http://www.vmmcproject.org/) There's also sorts of heinous shit that's gone on in relation to the ""circumcision to prevent AIDS"" measures, like [dangerous, maiming tribal rituals](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/25/male-circumcision-ceremonies-death-deformity-africa), [abductions and forced circumcisions of children by medical workers](http://www.vmmcproject.org/vmmc-abductions/), [AIDS scares leading to forced circumcisions of men by mobs](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/06/uganda-male-circumcision-campaign-goes-horribly-wrong/326625/)- you name it.

&gt;Other health benefits include decreased incidence of UTI in infants and penis and cervix cancer for women who have frequent intercourses with circumcised men.

I'm not terribly well read on the UTI reduction, but I think it's 1% in intact boys vs. 0.1% in circumcised boys. UTI's can be easily treated with antibiotics, like what's done with girls. 

The American cancer society [does not consider circumcision effective in preventing cancer, and considers the evidence for HPV prevention not firm:](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/penile-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/prevention.html)

&gt;In the past, circumcision (removing the foreskin on the penis) has been suggested as a way to lower penile cancer risk. This was based on studies that reported much lower penile cancer rates among circumcised men than among uncircumcised men. But in some studies, the protective effect of circumcision was no longer seen after factors like smegma and phimosis were taken into account.

&gt;In the United States, the risk of penile cancer is low even among uncircumcised men. Men who wish to lower their risk of penile cancer can do so in other ways, such as by avoiding human papillomavirus (HPV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and by not smoking. Men who aren’t circumcised can also lower their risk of penile cancer by practicing good genital hygiene. Although infant circumcision can lower the risk of penile cancer, based on the low risk of this cancer in the US, it would take over 900 circumcisions to prevent one case of penile cancer in this country.

&gt;The main factors influencing the risk of genital HPV infection in men are circumcision and the number of sexual partners. Men who are circumcised may have a lower chance of becoming and staying infected with HPV. The reasons for this are unclear. It may be that after circumcision the skin on the glans (tip of the penis) goes through changes that make it more resistant to HPV infection. Another theory is that the surface of the foreskin (which is removed by circumcision) is more easily infected by HPV. Still, circumcision does not protect completely against HPV infection. Men who are circumcised can still get HPV and pass it on to their partners.

&gt;I did cite numerous studies. Nowhere did I cite a study conducted in Africa (if anything, I pointed out the contradiction in a statement based on it), nor a study conducted on 100 people in 2003. Please read my comments carefully. I linked a study from 2016 and a systematic review from 2013, both conducted in developed nations on very sizeable samples. 

I lost track admittedly, but the first thing you cited (the 2013 one) was by Brian Morris. Someone posted footage of him, where he states completely insane, maniacal beliefs about the effectiveness of circumcision/the horrible risks from having a foreskin that no medical organization on earth even comes close to supporting, evidence of a fetishistic interest in circumcision, how he's largely seen as a pariah in Australia etc. You call him ""admittedly controversial."" He's a fucking psychopath. There is a preponderance of evidence to suggest he has a genuine, fetishistic interest in circumcision that motivates his beliefs and ""research"", that makes just about anything he produces or has a hand in (which is disturbingly a lot, and he is basically Australia's biggest proponent of circumcision, and arguably the most dedicated on Earth) deeply questionable. I mean, just look at his Facebook likes: http://archive .is /OtL6q (link broken because this subreddit doesn't allow archive dot is links.) Look at the one titled ""Circumsexual Pride."" Do you know what that is? That's a self-description for people who have a sexualized/fetishistic interest in circumcision. 

[This was notably used as a self-description by ""Ben Winkie"", a pedophile who took photos of himself masturbating over an infant circumstraint.](http://intactwiki.org/wiki/Circumfetish)

Someone else address the 2016 study. You did cite a small study from 2003: https://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20030430/circumcision-does-not-affect-sensitivity#1

&gt;Doctors and biologists from all over the world claim that sensitivity is not reduced, but I like rubbing my foreskin against my head, so they must be wrong!

They absolutely don't. [Here's what German pediatrics has to say:](http://www.intactamerica.org/german_pediatrics_statement)

&gt;The male foreskin is a part of the skin of the organ and fulfils important functions that protect the very sensitive glans. It normally covers the glans and protects it from harmful substances, friction, drying out and injuries. It has apocrine sweat glands, which produce cathepsin B, lysozyme, chymotrypsin, neutrophile elastase, cytokine, and pheromone such as androsterone. Indian scientists have shown that the subpreputial wetness contains lytic material, which has an antibacterial and antiviral function. The natural oils lubricate, moisten and protect the mucous membrane covering of the glans and the inner foreskin. The tip of the foreskin is richly supplied with blood by important blood vessel structures. The foreskin serves as a connective channel for Berufsverband der Kinder- und Jugendärzte (BVKJ. e.V.) many important veins. Circumcision can lead to erectile dysfunction as it destroys these blood vessels. Their removal can, as described by many of those who have been affected, lead to considerable limitations to sex life and cause psychological stresses.

Note how they also think being intact is healthier than being circumcised.

Here's also what [a brochure on infant circumcision from the Royal Australian College of Physicians](https://www.racp.edu.au/docs/default-source/advocacy-library/circumcision-brochure.pdf) says:

&gt;What does the foreskin do?
The foreskin has two main functions. 
1. It protects the tip of the penis (also known as the 
glans). 
2. It also has a sensory function as it contains some of 
the most sensitive areas of the penis. 

[Here is also a detailed video on the anatomy of the foreskin by a New Zealand researcher.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD2yW7AaZFw)

So no, they don't all claim this. And again, you live in Italy. Have you actually spoken to any urologists about this?

Oh and I haven't said a word about my circumcision status. All I did was- on top of acknowledging it is essential you have actual scientific and research evidence- there's worlds worth of visual evidence that should attest to what I'm arguing, and it's so voluminous (despite the fact it is mostly pornographic) it's on par with denying the Earth is round. But people don't argue the shape of the earth based purely on photographic evidence either.

&gt;Those studies are crippled while the only one which seems to yield opposite results, which by its own admission is incomplete due to how uncommon circumcision is in the country it was conducted is not!

The west, especially at the time, had no issue with shooting armed protestors if they thought it was justified and part of the problem was that the people facing the rioters had little facility for defence other than with gunfire. Our expectations NOW are different that what was common almost 50 years ago. Hence the growth of semi-lethal or less lethal methods since these events. 



Nor is it clear how we're even going to get a coherent way to even process these events to discover who did what and what and, most relevantly, why they chose to do it.

And it's not just some American doctors, ""forced retractions"" are remarkably common. The AAP has repeatedly made statements on this, and [it has been the basis for repeated legal action.](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/for-parents/help-with-forcible-foreskin-retraction/) It has everything to do with circumcision. I also explained the kind of legal and ethical implications that go into admission of the harm of the procedure, and the basic psychological impulse.

Let me put it this way, with forced retractions- many of the claimed health benefits of circumcision, on the part of American researchers, are due to forced retractions. They create problems and justifications for circumcision that would not exist if not for this practice.

Canadian and Australian researchers, given how circumcision is considerably less common in both of these countries and their medical communities are less favorable, are not biased to the degree American researchers are. And please stop claiming there's a scientific consensus circumcision doesn't harm sexual functioning. In my last post, I posted evidence from Australian, German and NZ researchers and doctors this is not true.

WHO/UNAIDS also says here that [“routine neonatal circumcision is not currently recommended on medical grounds.”](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43749/1/9789241596169_eng.pdf)

The western world, which is what's being discussed in here, does not have a HIV epidemic. And there is easy access to condoms which are vastly more effective.

4999,"&gt; If you come from a country where circumcision has never been common then of course you would look at it as a foreign and barbaric practice. That's not an objective look at it.

Actually that's an extremely objective viewpoint. They require medical justification for a medical procedure. They require circumcision to prove itself on it's own merits in order to be performed and become commonplace. It is not reasonable to accept religious or cultural reasons in lieu of medical necessity. Especially to cut off part of a patient's genitals at birth where the level of efficacy and evidence should be even higher. 

And it is not common in the entire English speaking world, only the US. It is no longer common in Canada, Australia, Britain, New Zealand, or any other European country where English is common. Not to mention that English is irrelevant, there are many other developed countries that are capable of making medically informed policies such as Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia, Switzerland, Sweden, Japan, China, etc. Why are you attempting to limit this to a language?

Finally let's put some stats in this discussion:

[“It has been estimated that 111 to 125 normal infant boys ... would need to be circumcised at birth to prevent one UTI.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)

[“The number needed to treat to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)

[“Decreased penile cancer risk: NNT = 900 – 322,000”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision). That means between 900 and 322,000 circumcisions need to be performed to prevent a single case of penile cancer.

Really? So if I were to go up to any urologist in any European country, they'd tell me that circumcision has no effect on pleasure? If that's the case, why exactly are Europeans so deeply uninterested (and often vocally against, like the article this thread is about) against circumcision?

I have an idea- look up an animation of the mechanics of the foreskin. Or if you're inclined, look up any piece of footage showing a man using his foreskin to masturbate or something. Then compare it to footage of a circumcised man. It's really obvious there's a blatant mechanical difference in the two. The intact man has a sheath of lubricated skin that can slide easily up and down his penis. That produces a really basic sensation anyone can enjoy.

It's not discussed much but stuff like the Dunmanway Killings was added reason to leave. The difference in counts for Protestants from the 1911 (or even 1901) to the 1926 census is pretty striking and the ratio of Protestants fell abruptly

You're talking nonsense again. There has been extensive research done on the decline in the Protestant population post independence. It had nothing to do with fear of reprisals, at all. The reasons were (in order of importance)

- desire to live in Britain, not in the Irish Republic. They lost cultural hegemony and control of the civil service. You no longer got a good job on the back of being a Protestant

- the fact that during the Great War so many young men died from the Protestant population. You already said yourself how sparse the population in the Free State was. Losing a third of the marriageable pool of men meant that a) many young Protestant women left or b) they married Catholic men. Due to the Ne Temere decree of the Catholic Church, their kids had to be raised Catholic

- Resulting from these 2 factors and others, the Protestant population lost ""critical mass"" as a significant minority.  Simple as that.

Now, compare this to your implication that there was some sort of pogrom against Protestants in the period. This is pure nonsense, as evidenced by the fact that there was a decline of 130,000 Protestants in the period 1911-1936. How many were murdered? 26,000? 13,000? Surely at least a couple of thousand???

5034,"Whole article here:
Volkswagen AG on Tuesday suspended a senior executive amid mounting outrage over revelations this week that the car maker had conducted experiments on animal and humans in an effort to disprove links between diesel fumes and respiratory illnesses.

The experiments were carried out in 2013 by a laboratory in the U.S. and commissioned by a European research group owned by Volkswagen, BMW AG BMW -0.96% and Daimler AG DMLRY -0.87% , the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars.

On Thursday, the New York Times reported the monkey experiments but added that a VW Beetle used for it was in fact rigged so that the animals were exposed to less concentrated fumes than advertised.


In an unrelated experiment, 25 people were connected to respirators and breathed a concentration that included nitrogen oxide, or NOx, the toxic particle contained in diesel emissions.

The revelations sparked an uproar in Germany over the use of animals and humans in dubious tests that appeared aimed at fooling the public to believe diesel emissions posed no public health hazard. They have plunged the auto companies into a public relations crisis and subjected them to harsh criticism from government officials and animal rights advocates.

On Tuesday, Volkswagen said it had suspended Thomas Steg, a former government spokesman now in charge of the company’s external communications and chief lobbyist.

The company is investigating whether Mr. Steg knew about the experiments. VW said it had accepted Mr. Steg’s request that he be suspended. It didn’t say whether he would remain on full pay. Mr. Steg couldn’t be contacted for comment.

Before the announcement, Volkswagen Chief Executive Matthias Müller, who became CEO in 2015 to handle the diesel scandal, had condemned the experiments as “unethical and revolting,” saying they had nothing to do with scientific research. “There are things that you just don’t do,” he said.

BMW and Mercedes condemned the experiments and distanced themselves from the study.

The European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector, known by its German initials E.U.G.T., which commissioned the experiments, was disbanded in 2017 in the wake of growing controversy over its work. The group was an industry lobby organization that aimed to provide scientific data to underpin industry initiatives and support technology goals.

The experiments that used monkeys in the labs of Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in Albuquerque, N.M., aimed to prove that Euro 6 diesel engines, the most advanced diesel technology, are cleaner than older technology and posed no health hazards. They wanted to show that banning diesel vehicles from urban traffic would have little impact on public health.

During the experiments, monkeys were put in sealed containers and forced to breath diesel fumes from a running car.

Another experiment had 25 humans breathe elevated levels of nitrogen oxide fumes, a toxic pollutant contained in diesel emissions, to study the impact of NOx emissions in the workplace.

German media complained that the experiments raised the specter of Nazi gas chambers and damaged German industry’s international reputation.

Steffen Seibert, spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel, said “these experiments on monkeys, and even on people, cannot be ethically justified in any way.”

The affair has cast a shadow over the industry’s lobbying efforts and could further weaken consumer confidence in diesel technology, which has fallen dramatically since the Volkswagen emissions scandal in 2015.",Pays de la Loire (France),/r/europe/comments/7u67zf/vw_suspends_top_lobbyist_over_diesel_fume_tests/dthwkju/,ViscondeSab,1517363783

5087,"&gt;Let me be clear: claiming that since many Americans, Canadians and Australians are circumcised, then their top scientists and researchers are all incapable of doing their job with honesty and competence is beyond bizarre.

Then I would invite you to look up the phenomenon of ""forced retraction of the foreskin."" The foreskin in boys typically doesn't retract until around puberty, as it's held in place by a thick, glue-like membrane that gradually weakens over time. Doing this prematurely is not only extremely painful, but often creates cuts, abrasions and other issues that result in infections and more. The AAP has repeatedly recommended against this, but do not properly enforce it. You will find parenting and doctors guides going back decades in America recommending parents pull back the foreskin of their child to clean under it. Doctors and medical staff across the country still do it constantly. This has been the basis for repeated lawsuits, including this one: www.watchfox29.com/story/37252223/infant-and-parents-sue-childrens-healthcare-of-atlanta-inc-for-alleged-forced-retraction-of-foreskin)

[This is extremely harmful and damaging and often ""necessitates"" post-natal circumcisions.](https://www.yourwholebaby.org/forced-retraction/) This is the basis for countless claims of the health issues found in intact boys and men in America and other circumcision countries, that do not happen in many, many others, because it basically never crosses the minds of doctors, parents etc. to pull back their son's foreskins. Because you're not supposed to. Owing to America (and to a lesser extent, places like Canada and Australia) being obsessed with circumcision, they have a horrendous understanding of basic male anatomy, so they do these things.

Oh, and [let's not forget American medical textbooks, anatomical illustrations etc. often say little about the foreskin, or don't even depict it.](http://madsciencewriter.blogspot.com/2015/03/child-circumcision-culture-based.html)

So yes, it's not a stretch (no pun intended) at all to say Americans and the small number of other developed countries with a recent history of circumcision, or who still practice it to a significant degree are incapable of approaching the topic of circumcision honestly when they don't even approach basic care of a little boy's penis with any sense, or have difficulty even acknowledging the existence of the foreskin in medical texts. That's of course not even going into things like the idea that the medical community has, for well over 100 years now, been widely performing an objectively harmful procedure incalculable millions of males, and the psychological aspects of admitting to the idea, that your parents might have allowed this etc., this of course further exacerbated by the complete lack of recognition and study of foreskin restoration.

5097,"Very good question. It serves the leftist establishment. Lisbon-Treaty ruined the EU.

@edit: to those who don't do economics or don't have the time to think about it. 

The EU is not freemarket or neoliberal, it is leftist or pseudo leftist due to the massive amount of economic regulations it pumps out everyday that hurts small business and creates a way bigger proportional barrier of entry for regular people, while the already established business can follow these regulations easier.

 
Such regulations are more detrimental to growth than any tax. Just google absurd EU legislation. 

Secondly the massive super-government institutions and massive wealth redistribution (which results in the bureaucracy swallowing up a chunk of the wealth for administration, and major resource misallocation.) are a disaster, we know from history that central planning really didn't work out so well for the communists. 

Simply put a bureaucrat approving some EU project by definition will be less efficient than if something pops into existence due to natural market demand. Hungary's watch towers are a funny example, total waste of money. 

And no, businessmen aren't all evil capitalist pigs that will exploit the masses if their every step and word isn't legislated by the force of the law. That is another inherently left/marxist thought.
They are just regular people that have predictable self interest of making some money, you know what to expect.

Multibillion/Trillion Corporation CEO's are a whole different story, and these are the people that lobby EU institutions, like the EU Comission, an unelected institution that can pass laws which supersede national elected governments/parliaments.  Again, thats partially a one-party government, the electable EU parliament cant even propose legislation, only approve or deny or give their opinion. Its not as undemocratic as communism, but it still means you have only a partially representative democracy mixed with a form of political aristocracy. 

Only redeeming quality is that you can leave the EU, unlike other leftist instutitions, where you'd go to Gulag if you voice the wrong opinion. Or at least we think you can leave the EU, lets see how Brexit works out. They want a new referendum i see. Because fuck democracy, you will vote until you vote the way we want it, right?

I know it's not a perfect similarity, but there's not a similar example to patents, to explain why patents ending after so many years makes sense, either.  Yet you don't seem angry at that idea.  Probably because you think how the world is today is how it always is and always should be, which is short-sighted.

&gt; NOBODY EVER will create a new cough medicine and we would still be using 1960's drugs

Why would a business stop researching, when researching makes an average profit over time?  You're being obtuse.  Also, government does a lot of research into new medications all the time.  Government has researched to create a lot of technology you take for granted, thinking it's a business that solely made it.

5116,"&gt; That doesn't mean you should own the right to that investment completely forever until the end of time

Any reason why not?

&gt; We already know that that's not the case for patents. Like I already told you, people spend millions into making patents. They don't get the sole rights to their investment. After a certain number of years they lose it.

THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

Patents are either done or not done. Businesses are a continues thing. You are never ""done"" with a business and you need to continuously invest in it. If something breaks, it needs to be replaced 10, 15, 20 years in. When you have a patent you don't ""replace"" it or repair it or anything.

And you also DON'T lose the rights to manufacture your patented drug, just others have that right too.

It's literally nothing alike.

&gt;often comes from bank loans

Great! Banks doing their job then. Go banks!

&gt;are the smart ones in business?

Statistically yes. Not really relevant though.

&gt;They're able to manage our societies because they have ownership of the businesses, and we don't socialize those businesses.

You have a completely wrong perception on who the rich people nowadays are. Go take a look at the top 100 wealthiest people alive today. The vast majority are people who were self-made. 

This isn't feudalism where people inherited all their lands and that is how things worked. The most money making corp today is apple with 5.000 employees. 

&gt;People always invest when profit can be made.

Yeah, and guess what? If you are going to take it away in 5 years, there will be no profit to be made.

&gt; Having 25 years to make as much profit as possible with a business, before it becomes socialized, is plenty of time. It's 1/2 of your career. Then they can just be part of the business like the rest of society, and the gains in the economy will be evenly dispersed.

Say it with me:

businesses have continuous expenditures

businesses have ups and downs

businesses have to change their market strategy all the time

businesses change their focus all the time

businesses are not static things like patents but active organizations that need to adapt constantly.

businesses need constant investment else they fail.

urging businesses to make short term profit draining the company dry is fucking idiotic.

its true there was assassination, but i dont think its from the greek state. the orders were from another priest. and also in return the albanians killed the greek metropolitan of Korytsa, Fotios.

&gt;Greece sabotaged every attempt Albanian religious figures made to reform the orthodox church. Even now the appointed archbishop in Albania is Greek.

not exactly sabotaged, they used to do it everywhere from albania to bulgaria, jerusalem, egypt etc. because before that the liturgy was only in greek, and when nationalism started rising many tried to translate the writings and make the liturgy in their native tongue. also, the archbishop its totally different reason, its because during communism religions were not tolerated, there were no religious schools so there wasnt anyone proper for this kind of job, atheism levels were very high, so the HQ in Constantinople thought it would be wise to send a person with big experience there. he actually is doing very good work if you ask all the locals that know him albanians or greeks.

now about all the other stuff you say about Greek language and Orthodoxy. the original language was greek so some parts in the orthodox faith in many countries from europe to asia and to africa are not translated, they lose the meaning if they are. so its very logical for orthodox priests to speak greek. and i bet most orthodox priests in the world know greek, from america to siberia.

5330,"Seriously, what mass immigration are you talking about? There aren't hordes of people storming the border 24/7 to get in your precious union, that is simply a myth.

Second, the imperalistic history is important to keep in mind, because up until less than a life-time ago, the UK invaded, ruled and adminstered parts of the world like India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Caribbean, South Africa, Kenya, Egypt and Hong Kong as dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories without their consent and while neglecting their autonomy, which is in fact a dilution of their culture. I find it hypocritical that when a way smaller amount of immigrants/refugees find their way to the UK with whatever reasons, some describe it like it's the end of the UK.

It isn't. What the UK did to those countries, is in no way as severe as the influence of immigrants in the UK nowadays. How do you reason that they dilute your culture, when it's actually the other way around? How is the small minority forcing change on the large majority in their way of life? They don't. Unless British people actually want to, which isn't the case.

Last I checked individuals wanting to apply for British citizenship have to demonstrate their commitment by learning English, Welsh or Gaelic and by having an understanding of British history, culture and traditions. Any individual seeking to apply for naturalisation or indefinite leave to remain must pass the official Life in the UK test. So it's their culture that is cast aside for the UK culture, not the other way around. Which is contrary to how the UK imposed its laws on foreign-controlled territories.

5365,"&gt; Well, in modern Swedish the word is pronounced with an initial /t͡ʃ/, while Finnish has retained the original /k/, so the loan can't be super recent.  

Most likely the word was borrowed from Finland Swedish rather than Standard Swedish, and still today there are Finland Swedish dialects with a hard *k* in *kälke*. Going back, say, 200 years and a hard *k* was probably the most common pronounciation in the eastern part of the kingdom. Furthermore, the frozen oblique -*a* in *kelkka* (ON *kjalki* was nom. while *kjalka* was obl. = acc., dat. and gen.) is also an eastern novative feature (shared with many Svea dialects in Sweden) which can't be extremely old either, at most going back to the 1600's. Given these facts my guess is that *kelkka* was borrowed in the 1700's or so, fropm a Finland Swedish frozen oblique *kälka*.  

&gt; t's also not 100% certain that it is from Swedish, since Finnish (or its ancestor) has also borrowed vocabulary from Proto-Germanic, Gothic and Old Norse.  

According to my analysis it's very likely borrowed from some early modern Finland Swedish dialect. But yeah, in principle it could be borrowed from Proto-Norse *kelkan*, but then you must explain why the *n* is lost (that is, why not ""*kelkkan*"").",,/r/europe/comments/7tuipi/outside_a_school_in_northern_sweden_we_call_it_a/dthavhu/,AllanKempe,1517341988

5476,"We didn't plan an itinerary ahead. We just had Swiss Train passes (1st class, natch) and went wherever it looked nice. Also, we've been back 6 or 8 times since then so we've seen pretty much. Of course there are huge areas we've never visited! Graubünden for example!

(Spoiler: Lauterbrunnen/ Mürren was the highlight)

We landed in Geneva and stayed the first night in Lausanne. What a beautiful city. I've seen it described as the San Francisco of Switzerland, and I agree. Gorgeous setting above the lake, with a real young, arty sort of scene.

Then Zermatt. Amazing location, and of course the Matterhorn- although any of the surrounding mountains would be a highlight anywhere else. But that toothy peak steals the show.

Then the Swiss train through part of Italy, through the [Centovalli](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en/centovalli-onsernone.html) to Locarno to stay overnight in Lugano. This is Italian Switzerland and it is chic, slick and beautiful. Great food, wonderful hotel. They upgraded us because (after they asked) we told them it was our honeymoon. We like to remember it as the Rock Hudson/ Doris Day suite. Real Old School Cool material.

One of our guidebooks said that even hardened Alpinist shrug their shoulders and say Lauterbrunnen is the most beautiful valley in Europe. So we had to see it.

It is.

Murren and Wengen share matching perches atop this valley, one on the east and the other on the west side. We have stayed in both and prefer Mürren . The hotels seem a little cozier, the village a little more welcoming and we love the view of the [Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau](https://www.contentedtraveller.com/big-3-mountains-eiger-monch-jungfrau/). But Wengen is really just as nice. 

Other places we've been:
Leukerbad with the hot springs. Also, if you are fit you can climb up to the top of the cliff, and even cross over a pretty remote and barren landscape towards Kandersteg, staying overnight at [Hotel Schwarenbach](http://www.schwarenbach.ch/home/).

Another hanging valley near Kandersteg is a hidden gem the [Gasterntal valley](https://www.isi.edu/~hobbs/kandersteg1/kandersteg1.html). There is hardly any development there, with just a few rustic hotels and the only traffic is a mini bus that runs a few times a day. Easy walking from Kandersteg.

The Glacier Express train towards Chur, and then extended towards San Moritz. San Moritz is a disappointment. One book called it ""The kind of place that gives money a bad name"".
But the train trip on the [Landwasser Viaduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landwasser_Viaduct) is a do- not- miss.

I have more if you like! But need to head out right now. I'll check back later. I'm a bit of an evangelist about the place.

5564,"&gt;The very fact that the EU can decide independently on some policy areas is an infringement on your sovereignty as a state. 

It is *delegation* of authority deriving from that sovereignty.  It does not infringe upon the sovereignty of the state.

It is precisely the ability of a state to withdraw or extend that authority which makes the state sovereign.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty

&gt;Sovereignty is the full right and power of a governing body over itself, without any interference from outside sources or bodies. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity.

The EU is not sovereign, because the states can choose to remove the authority it exercises from it.  The EU in cannot do the same to the state.  This renders the state the supreme authority, with the EU only acting at the state's behest.

&gt;You reclaim your full sovereignty practically by leaving, not before that.

I disagree.  The states have not ever given up their sovereignty.  They have only decided that they choose not to, by convention, exercise it.  Nothing actually prevents them from doing so.  If they had ever given up their sovereignty, if they had ever made the EU instead sovereign, then the EU would be the ultimate authority in the eyes of the world and would be able to say make ultimate decisions about what the states may do.

This is fundamentally different from the situation in a federation.  In a federation, the states do not merely *choose* not to exercise their sovereignty on a way that conflicts with the central government.  They are no longer sovereign powers.  They can not make that choice.

&gt;So says wiki, too,  by the way.

Well, let's look at your links:

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supranational_union#Distinguishing_features_of_a_supranational_union
&gt;
&gt; The EU has supranational competences, but it possesses these competences only to the extent that they are conferred on it by its member states (Kompetenz-Kompetenz).

The EU acts as a subordinate agent of the state.

In the eyes of EU law, the EU may judge the state's actions — okay, fine.  But that means nothing outside of the EU.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union#Sovereignty

&gt;While the member states are sovereign, the union partially follows a supranational system that is comparable to federalism…Combined sovereignty is delegated by each member to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions.

This is a delegation of authority.  It is not a transfer!  And they are free to stop delegating authority — though if they do so, the other EU members will not permit them representation in the EU.

The sense in which the EU is federation-like is not that EU member states are not sovereign, but that it has built a more-weighty bureaucracy and set of institutions than is normally the case for a confederation — that is what looks like a federation.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7tstm3/question_about_eus_primacy_of_law/dtgv9iq/,vokegaf,1517327345

The case is quite well known and we know that he was alone in his acts and planning of the terror attacks. While he was not alone in his views on immigrants and islam and discussed this with other people with simular views online. I call him delusional because he actually thought his acts would create political change in the direction he wanted while it quite naturally solidified peoples disgust for neo-nazis and their likes.

Right wing terrorism is also something to be taken very seriously. Yet, if we count terrorist attacks in Europe the last 10 years, you should be able to see that it's not the right wing that is the biggest threat. That Breivik was effective and some even say lucky in how slow the police were to mobilize does not change the fact that this was **one** terrorist attack while there have been how many done by radical islamists since then? Do I really have to list them for you?

What are you trying to achieve by your post? To me it seems like you're trying to say we can't discuss radical islamic terrorism because Norway had one right wing terrorist? Should we close our eyes for what is the trend in most western european countries?

We should fight all forms of terrorism. The mentality behind killing innocents in terrorattacks is unjustifiable. For the victims it does not matter much if it's a right wing extremist, left or islamic extremist. 

Where would you put most resources if you were to head an anti-terror unit?

Well, PC Manufacturers have less support costs because they only have to worry about one OS (and therefore more people would be in the market for purchasing one of their systems), developers don't have to worry about porting their software to multiple OS's or test compatibility across multiple OS's, a small business having just one viable software to choose from means that it's easy to find staff with cheaper support costs to maintain/use it.

Flip it round to an Apple monopoly, and suddenly you wipe out a bunch of PC manufacturers since hardly anyone will buy their hardware, developers will dread every new version of MacOS incase yet another thing breaks without notice, small businesses will be forced to pay Apple prices for hardware and dongles, and custom built/repair computer shops/custom builds will cease to exist.

In France, on the first turn of professional election, there is an obligation for the candidate to be part of **one of the 4 officials unions privilegied by the laws**. This is what we call the *monopoly labour bodies*. A representative must be register to a union. The professionnal election are not really open to a worker who is not a member of a union. It is very rare to have a representative who is not linked to one of the 4 main unions. It is one of the case where the power of unions is against the rights of workers.

5610,"As a kid that grew in the murky 90s in Bulgaria, I can remember we got flooded with all kinds of sects and new cults after the fall of Communism and its atheist ideology (Bulgarians weren't too strict Eastern Orthodox Christians even before that, neither are they now). 

There was an economic crisis and unemployment with many confused and desperate people as a result - and a spiritual void, too. Once you got only atheism and state Communist cult to the Party and its leaders, the official Bulgarian Orthodox Church being dependent on the State and heavily infiltrated with Secret services (the so-called ""State Security"") agents. Then you suddenly have all those Evangelists (plus the televangelist type, tongue-speaking Pentecostals and faith healers), you got Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses going from door to door, you got Krishna's followers giving their books on the streets, plus you got a crazy amount of folk psychic healers and claryvoyants, astrologers and other wackos. 

Sometimes we couldn't recognize some missionary events at first sight - you could go to some play or a musical in a big concert hall and think it's just for the sake of art, but then a pastor comes and turns it into preaching (it happened to me and mum with some family friends). Some people were hooked up on sects, but later turned to more traditional and settled forms of Protestantism or Evangelical Christianity. As a whole, we became more and more aware and resistant to new cults which slowly began disappearing over time.

Just a note: we had our Protestants in small numbers due to missionaries in late 19th/earl 20th century, then in late Communist times in the 80s some kids from foreign language schools got acquainted with small Protestant groups (tho sometimes even their pastors were State security agents, too), but their popularity flourished in the 90s with their leaflets, free Bibles and large gatherings with music and preaching.

5615,"&gt; I think that the two sides in Catalonia are now pushed too far away from each other which makes looking for a compromise difficult for everyone involved, both the separatists and the unionists.

I agree, but I'm sure if it only depended on Catalans, a solution would be found. Something between a full independence and the current autonomy. The problem is that anything like that must be approved by Spain too, and no political party in Spain (except Podemos) seems to be interested in finding a political solution to the current situation.

&gt; It won't be anyone else, unless that anyone else threatens to secede from Spain.

Probably Spain's unity is the most important topic, but what about somebody pushing for a Spanish Republic? Or big economic reforms? I'm pretty sure they will act the same against them.

Indeed, the ""Operation Catalonia"" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Catalonia) affected also some left wing politicians in Spain (mostly from Podemos).

- the concept of primacy of EU law was imposed by the ECJ, i.e. the supranational institution, not created voluntarily by the member states. These only chose to conform to this new reality after the fact.

- As shown in Brexit, the costs of leaving the EU are gigantic, and leaving also takes years to execute. It can also be done only once. If therefore the only options a member state has in any particular case coming before the ECJ  are either to comply with its judgment or to leave the EU, then that means member states are pretty much forced to accept the ECJ's judgment. This gives the ECJ a lot of power it can use independently of how much power the member states are prepared to concede to it.

5706,"&gt;Northen countries enjoy the growth of the eurozone as much as the southern countries.

Low interest rates is not what Northern Europe needs right now. We have very high employment rates which don't justify low interests anymore. The major downsides of this policy are rising rents and especially due to negative real interest rates a quasi expropriation of savings. 

&gt;Also the depreciation of the euro is very good for export driven economies

The Euro isn't cheap anymore. Currently we're at the highest point of the last for years (1 Euro = 1,24 Dollars). 

&gt;It’s amazing to see them focus so much on the negatives instead of seeing the bigger picture.

A view of the bigger picture is exactly what proponents of a short term expansionary monetary policy lack. 

&gt;I’m almost starting to suspect that it is just a hate for southern economies that drives them. If they aren’t kept in the vice of poor growth or stagnation then they will never perform the ‘structural reforms’ they love so so much.

If the EZB keeps buying worthless Greece bonds, they have no incentive to reform their economy. Those reforms are long overdue. In the short run this migh help, but this is no viable solution for the long run. 

&gt;It’s ideology over sound economics

It will once you’re gone, yes. But that was not the case prior.

Pretending like the UK does not have the 3rd highest population, and thus third highest representation in European Parliament. You were the “You guys at the center with all the power.” 

&gt;There's a hell of a lot of EU exceptionalism going around at the moment (pay your protection money, but no voting! etc.) but you don't seem too bothered about that.

I actually chuckled at this part because this is the exact opposite of exceptionalism. What we want is for the UK to play by the same rules that everyone, including the UK, agreed to. We ask that *no exceptions be made.* What is exceptionalism without exceptions? As for “no voting!” You **chose** to leave the EU! Do you want a vote in the EU parliament without membership in the EU? That’s amazing, I’ve never even heard that talking point. That’s simply amazing.

&gt;We simply want a good relationship between neighbours like most developed countries in the world do.

No you don’t. You want all the benefits of being in the EU, without paying the cost that those benefits incur on all of us. We’re paying for the cable bill and you don’t see why we won’t let you use it.

&gt;Nowhere else are countries forced to part with billions of pounds in order to do trade with one another.

You’re right about that. What you forgot is that no one pays billions of pounds to trade with the EU from outside either. [Norway pays less than one billion euros.](https://fullfact.org/europe/norway-eu-payments/) ~400 million in grants to the 15 poorest EU economies, ~390 Million in membership of certain **voluntary** EU initiatives, and ~50 million as a “membership fee.“ Please note that the Norway deal represents the absolute best-case scenario for the UK.

5721,"&gt; I'm sorry but that's not how democracy works and I'm having a sense of deja-vu here because I'm pretty sure we discussed about this already. the cornerstone principle of consitutional democracies is that the people exercise their soverignity within the limits of the constitution. in Italy, for example, that's literally in article 1, second paragraph. democracy cannot exist outside of the boundaries that regulate the fundamental principles of a given society. In modern democracy that's the constitution, either written in a formal, hard written document or based on established constitutional principles (like common law countries). 

Well, that's another topic. I was wondering if laws made sense, not if the situation was legal or not.

In my opinion, having a direct democracy where people's vote implies direct changes in politics (in this case, choosing a president) matters more than having the deputies physically in the Parliament. But as I said, I'm not saying if it's currently legal or not to be a ""remote President"", but that I think it should be.

We shouldn't ask ourselves such selfish question if we actualyl want the EU to function. Egoistically, Germany is doing the ""right"" choice. But I'd ratehr they put more faith in the European project instead.

&gt;Poland sees the UK and US as their allies, not Germany.

I want that to change, so germany is included too.

&gt;The ruling PiS party makes anti-German statements on a daily basis and directs state TV to multiply them.

Wouldn't be possible if we commited more to working together with Poland.

&gt;It's not the opinion of the majority of polish people, but no idea what the sentiment will be in 10 or 20 years.

The course it's going now, PiS will turn out to be right and Poland will hate the EU.

&gt;Especially since Poland together with Hungary leads the wave of authoritarian governments in the EU.

Yes, that's a problem too. We need to work on this constructively together.

&gt;This all just means adding a potentially hostile government in the German-Russian trade that costs extra money.

So you trust Russia more than Poland at this point?

&gt;Cutting Russia from the European market would be a good move for USA; they are looking for new markets for their oil and gas exporters. There is a good reason US congress wants to impose on Russia, they are their competition. 

I'd much rather have the USA as a partner than Russia. I might get flak for that opinion, especialyl with the Cheeto-dictator in the White Hosue right now, but the U.S. were partners to Europe when we needed them most. We need to rebuild that relationship again and help the U.S. find the right course again.

&gt;And in turn, would that really make Europe safer? 

Yes.

&gt;A deal with Germany means Russia builds a lot of infrastructure and binds itself to western markets.

Russia is shitting all over European interests and they hold us hostage with the gas pipelines. We are so safe, guys. Thank our Russian overlord that they haven't started marching on Berlin yet.

&gt;If they can't sell to Europe, they will likely sell it to China.

I don't care what they do with their gas. If the EU doesn't buy the gas, China will crush Russia on the price, just like they did in the past. China doesn't even need that much gas, they don't need Russia.

&gt;I consider a Russia with less economic ties to Europe that is dependent on its eastern neighbour much worse than the alternative.

I can't help but feel different people voted out for different reasons.

Of the leavers I know in person I've not heard anything better defined than a generic ""Sovereignty"". The guys in question aren't dribbling idiots (one are comp. sci. undergrad, one finished a masters in the same subject) and they are easily my most right leaning friends in all political regards. Normally they're quite willing discuss things but I never get *reasons* out of them, just feelings.

The reasons people tell me they've heard from their friends are more depressing:

* An Indian guy several who's British Indian friends said they voted out because the Poles had it too easy coming here: they (Indian's) are subject to our frankly insanely restrictive immigration system, so the Poles should be too.

* A friend claims to know an Australian (able to vote as a commonwealth citizen) who voted leave because he thought it was unfair we got to avoid the long queues at airports in the EU line.

I really want to disbelieve the last one, but my friend swears blind it's true.

I never deny there is a lot wrong with the EU, but given our own politicians are even worse I've always felt it would be better to improve the EU than leave it.

Right, but I would say we had never seen the level of violence of October 1st since the restoration of democracy. We never imagined the government shutting down hundreds of websites in a few days. Or prosecuting civil leaders for taking part in demonstrations.

What I did expect was an ""economic war"" like what they did pushing companies to leave Catalonia or constant attacks from Spanish media against pro-independence Catalans, for example. But never what I said in the paragraph above.

I'm not a lawyer neither know the correct terms in English, but it looks like the Constitutional Court had to evaluate the proposition (*recurso*) of the Spanish Government to suspend the investiture. It was not possible to do it beforehand because, until now, everything has been 100% legal.

Legally, the Constitutional Court could only do that. Say ""Yes"" or ""No"" to that *recurso*, nothing else.

But in order not to put in evidence the Spanish government, the Constitutional Court made a verdict overreaching its competences.

Many of us have family that originate in what is now northern Greece, and they don't identify as greek, but ethnically Macedonian. They were not part of the refugee exchange with Turkey when Greece was handed northern Greece after the Balkan wars. These people are referred to as 'endopii' - I hope I have the term right.

My belief is that the issue is a political one, not a historical one. If Greece recognize an ethnic Macedonian minority, they will need to compensate all that was taken from them. Also, I don't believe Macedonia will ever be part of the EU. If they were to be accepted in this club, then they would basically have access to their ancestral lands without going to war. The Ottomans (now Turkey) were decent record keepers, they would be able to show what has happened in northern Greece.

Contrary to both previous president, macron doesn't seem to care much about his popularity and is going forward according to his vision.

- **65+: 64.5%**

- 25-44: 59%
- 45-64: 72%
- **65+: 72%**

*Additionally:*

The same YouGov poll found that:

- 61% of **all** ""LEAVE"" voters agreed that *""damage to the British economy""* was a price worth paying for Brexit, (versus 20% disagreeing)
- ~39% of **all** ""LEAVE"" voters agreed that a *""family member losing a job""* was a price worth paying for Brexit, (versus 38% disagreeing)

Oddly, the same poll also found that:

- 34% of **all* ""REMAIN"" voters agreed that *""damage to the British economy""* was a price worth paying for Brexit, (versus ~38% disagreeing)

After the second world war the state struggled to build enough housing for its citizen and it took I think way into the 70s to succeed in this task by building ""Plattenbauten"" (those ugly prefabricated building motherfuckers you could see everywhere). They were cheap affordable housings in a state where building or owning your own house wasnt as common in other coutries, where even getting all the parts to build your own house was a full blown adventure of trade and barter. Then there was also the whole thing of having to pay outlandish sums for things like a used car or new living room furniture. But what really broke it for the majority of people was the way the unification played out. Savings of generations got crushed by the exchange course and large parts of the population went unemployed ""over night"". They either had a hard time to get a job with their often old and obsolete qualifications or they had to start again at basically zero with retraining from the start after a few years of unemployment.

5942,"MI6 has made a rare public tribute to a Second World War spy as the head of the intelligence service said its successes need no longer remain private.

Alex Younger lead tributes to Frank Foley, who used his position as Berlin station chief before the Second World War to issue thousands of visas to Jews struggling to escape Germany.

In rare public comments, the chief of the Secret Intelligence Service told members of Mr Foley’s family and the Holocaust Educational Trust that it was difficult for the agency to tell of its successes, but the unassuming spy had been “a consummately effective intelligence officer”.

He said: “There is a mantra that surrounds MI6’s history that reads ‘Our successes are private, our failures are public’.

“The need for secrecy has sometimes helped create a pretty distorted and inaccurate narrative of the organisation’s achievements since its foundation in 1909.

“It’s a wonderful thing for MI6 that one of its most distinguished members’ successes are no longer private.”

Mr Foley was posted in Berlin throughout the 1920s and 1930s, and monitored the Nazis’ rise and their persecution of the Jews.

Exploiting his cover as an embassy passport officer, he issued thousands of visas to help Germans escape the Nazi’s anti-Jewish laws.

He broke the rules that were supposed to limit the number of Jewish people given asylum in Britain and its colonies, at times provoking the wrath of his superiors. In the late 1930s he even hid people in his house while they were waiting to escape.

Mr Foley is credited with saving more than 10,000 people.

Mr Younger said: “Frank’s dignity, compassion and bravery are in no doubt.  As a consummately effective intelligence officer he witnessed at first hand the Nazi seizure of power, and the horrors and depravity of the regime.  While many condemned and criticised the Nazis’ discriminative laws, Frank took action.

“With little regard for his personal safety he took a stance against evil.  Despite exposing himself to significant personal risk, Frank made a decision to help.  He knew the dire consequences were he to get caught.  Frank’s tenacity and passion saved the lives of many thousands of European Jews, using his position as a passport control officer, he ensured that they could travel safely out of the clutches of Hitler’s killers.”

Intelligence chiefs have in recent years attempted to dispel the James Bond or George Smiley image of spies as they try to widen recruitment and hire more technical experts and people from a broader range of backgrounds.

Maybe harsher restriction on internet companies, like there is in the automotive industry, for saftey etc, which i think is harsher in EU which might be the reason why they are more competetive. Restrictions in online advertising, opening up social media (algorithms, who buys ads etc) giving consumers more power over their information online etc. These would hit equally geographically, maybe even encourage startups as they can build with these things in mind. Which might be cheaper than rebuilding.

Restricitons are usually bad unless they protect consumers and workers from exploitation. As corporations seems unable to se them as humans with their own lives, only tools for their profit. Unless they are restricted from doing so. Environmental effects also are ignored to a large degree, therby justifying restrictions. Restrictions on trade is the bad part.

6032,"No idea about aerial-to-naval buzzing, but in case of interceptions like these, it's all about the cost efficiency. What the news never mentions is the fuel consumption and fuselage sturdiness of the planes involved. Whenever a potentially hostile military plane approaches your airspace, which inevitably leads to an interception before it can ever have the chance to enter said airspace (otherwise you may have to shoot it down and cause a global conflict), you have to scramble a jet at least. If the plane in question is a turboprop, the intercepting side ends up spending more fuel than the potential airspace violator simply because jet engines use a crapload of fuel. To compensate, the intercepting side takes advantage of other differences between plane types. Patrol and recon aircraft, compared to fighters, have significantly weaker structural integrity, simply because they're not supposed to dogfight and withstand hits. By closing in, forcing aircraft to take wild maneuvers and keeping the air turbulent (is this even the right word?), the intercepting side imposes a lot of wear on the aircraft, while the fighter remains pretty well off, since it's designed for stunts like these. The intention is to make the potential airspace violator put the aircraft out of commission and replace it earlier than would've been necessary otherwise.

6088,"&gt; Yes, but that's rather dodging the question:

No, it's acknowledging the reality that there is no clearcut answer to the question that's always true. It depends on the perspective you take, that of the EU, that of a member state which unconditionally accepts the supremacy of EU law, or that where acceptance is theoretically conditional but practically existent for almost all intents and purposes. 

&gt; In the eyes of the EU, it is not permissible for member states to ignore EU law, or they must leave the EU. This is true of their law or constitution. The EU does not claim the power to compel states to remain, nor does it claim itself to be a sovereign entity. It merely claims the authority to judge what is correct within the framework of EU law.

To be precise, the EU's legal theory is contained in the *Van Gend en Loos* ruling as well as in *Costa*. The ECJ ruled in *Van Gend and Loos* that: 

""The [Union] constitutes a new legal order of international law for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights, albeit in limited fields* [modified to ""ever wider fields"" in a later ruling], and the subjects of which comprise not only Member States but also their nationals…[Union] law therefore not only imposes obligations on individuals but is also intended to confer upon them rights which become part of their legal heritage.""

So the ECJ operates on the assumption that EU law supersedes national law, and that EU law has direct effect in the member states: individuals can invoke EU law in national courts to set aside national law when they believe their national law conflicts with that of the EU.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/7tstm3/question_about_eus_primacy_of_law/dtgd15i/,Jack_Merchant,1517295344

6238,"&gt;EU law in general *does* take primacy of application over national law, i.e. it does supersecede national law in that way. That includes national constitutional law!

But as I was getting at, this only applies to EU law's view of what states should do, if they are to conform to EU law.  EU law itself is no more than a treaty from the standpoint of independent states, and treaties are governed by the constitution of the state.

If the US signs up for an arms control treaty with Russia, it agrees that it will not do certain things or it will violate the treaty.  There may even be some sort of Russia-US arbitration court that determines whether either is in violation of the treaty.

But if the US Constitution changes in a way that requires it to violate the treaty, then it must do so, because it is its constitution that governs how it acts.

The EU today has the role of that arms control arbitration board.  All the arms control board can do is say ""you are violating the arms control treaty"".  And in the sense that it reserves the right to take opinions on even the US Constitution, there it has primacy — but only in its own eyes, only from its own viewpoint.  The US Constitution can say ""arms control board, you are free to make a ruling, but what I say still goes, regardless of your ruling on the matter, because I am superior to you"", and the US thereby retains its sovereignty.  The arms control board might say ""you're violating your obligations, and I release all other members of the treaty to their obligations to you, and they can do so without breaking the arms control agreement's internal rules"".

If the EU federalizes, then the member states then turn over sovereignty to a single aggregate, a federation.  At that point, they cannot withdraw, and their constitutions are subordinate to the federation's constitution.  Internationally, they are no longer sovereign states.

For both the federation and the confederation, it may be the case that the arbitration board views itself as taking precedence over state constitutions.  However, only for the federation does this *mean* anything outside the eyes of the arbitation board.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7tstm3/question_about_eus_primacy_of_law/dtfzqe9/,vokegaf,1517277618

6263,"&gt;  see restricted freedom as a very serious form of violence against women

What does that mean? Like I wouldn't classify that as violence either, but I wouldn't see that as acceptable either. 

&gt; Physical violence is not 'very serious'

Against whom? Against women? Against men? If it is involving two men fighting, I would see eastern europe as saying that it is not very serious. 

&gt; Sexual violence against women is only ""fairly serious""

What is the definition of ""sexual violence"". I highly doubt 20-25% of people in Lithuania, Latvia, Portugal, Austria, etc. see raping someone as fairly serious.  Also what is fairly serious and very serious? 

&gt; Good girls stay at home. A raped woman is not angry. She is ashamed. She wants to forget what happened and very often blames herself.

Dude, have you been to Poland. We are not the fucking medieval ages. Most women work as well here and actually have better work standards compared to their male counterparts then most of the EU. 

&gt; At 59%, the proportion of employed women in Poland is around the OECD average (60%).The gender pay
gap at median earnings in Poland (10%) is one of the lowest in the OECD (the OECD average is 16%); and
the pay gap among top earners in Poland is small. Women in Poland are more likely to have permanent
employment than men and to work in professional occupations. The proportion of women managers in
Poland (36%) is one of the highest among OECD countries (the average is 32%). 

[Source](http://www.oecd.org/gender/Closing%20the%20Gender%20Gap%20-%20Poland%20FINAL.pdf)

&gt; According to Nowakowska, women in Poland are still ashamed to talk about violence they experienced, even in anonymous surveys. Also oftentimes, those who are supposed to help, including the police, confuse women by hinting that the violence they were subject to can be reduced to a solvable “conflict” within the family.

So like what happens in every country..... What country in the world can you go to where a female who experiences violence in her family is perfectly okay with running to the police and sending their husband or father to prison for years. I would have a hard time sending anyone in my family to prison, unless it's especially serious. 

It's cool to paint Eastern Europeans and the poorer countries (including you in this Portugal) as backwards bumpkins who keep our women at home but at the same time rape all women. Look I could make an argument that conservative societies would actually have less instances of rape then more sexually open societies like you find in the West, but for you, if the rapes are too high you would say we are raping monsters, if they are too low, we are covering up rapes, so what number of rapes is acceptable for you? 

Poland has problems with violence in the families, ya it is definitely happens and the only divorces I have heard of in my friend groups are due to the husbands being violent. If you put your hands on someone you are supposed to love, you are scum in my eyes. If you are angry, hitting a family member is the last thing you should do, I don't know, go chop wood to get the anger out. We have come a long way and I think we have much progress to do, but don't talk down upon us from your high horse.

George Bush tried the same thing in 2002 and backed down in a couple of weeks:

&gt;On November 11, 2003, the WTO came out against the steel tariffs, saying that they had not been imposed during a period of import surge—steel imports had actually dropped a bit during 2001 and 2002—and that the tariffs therefore were a violation of America's WTO tariff-rate commitments. The ruling authorized more than $2 billion in sanctions, the largest penalty ever imposed by the WTO against a member state, if the United States did not quickly remove the tariffs.[2] After receiving the verdict, Bush declared that he would preserve the tariffs.[3] In retaliation, the European Union threatened to counter with tariffs of its own on products ranging from Florida oranges to cars produced in Michigan, with each tariff calculated to likewise hurt the President in a key marginal state. The United States backed down and withdrew the tariffs on December 4.[4]

6330,"The adoption of Law 447 by the US may mean harassment of Poland

In December last year, the US Senate unanimously approved the bill 447 (Justice for Uncompensated Survivors Today), which gives the US Department of State the right to assist international organizations associating victims of the Holocaust and supporting them through their diplomatic channels in regaining Jewish assets that do not have heirs.

According to the procedure, the draft was sent to the Foreign Affairs Committee, from where it will go to the House of Representatives. Finally, the bill will be on the desk of US President Donald Trump.

Professor Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, specializing in the study of Polish-Jewish relations, said in an interview with PAP that in the event of the adoption of Law 447 ""various actions should be expected"". - From unofficial pressures through official lobbying to positive or negative sanctions. Positive sanctions are, in short, bribes. For example, if Poland pays compensation ordered by Jewish organizations, it will be protected by anti-missile shield or favored trade status. Negative sanctions may mean - in case of rejection of claims - a boycott of Polish products, prohibitive tariffs on them, or refusal to grant a loan. There are hundreds of various sticks and carrots in the sanctions category - said prof. Chodakiewicz.

He added that compliance of Law 447 with the American Constitution is not currently challenged due to the lack of a ""Polish lobby"". - Polish diplomacy does not know about such matters. First, consult experts to see if it is possible at all. Because of what reason the Republic of Poland is to interfere in the internal affairs of the United States. If they should, Americans of Polish origin should do it. Unfortunately, they have neither an organization, nor resources, neither strategy nor leadership - explained the specialist.

According to prof. Chodakiewicz, one of the consequences that may be imposed by the act is ""harassing Poland on various levels, until it breaks like Switzerland in its time"". As he explained, if the law is adopted, it will concern ""all countries of the world (...) but in particular it will apply to Poland and other post-Soviet countries"".

On July 16, 1960, the Polish government signed a contract with the United States, under which he pledged to pay 40 million. American dollars at that time for total settlement and satisfaction of all claims of US citizens, both natural and legal persons due to the nationalization and other type of taking over by Poland of property which took place in Poland before the date of signing and entering into force of this agreement. The repayment of this obligation by Poland took place in annual installments and was fully repaid and on January 10, 1981.

Professor Chodakiewicz, referring to the issue of the agreement signed by Poland, explained that the new law replaces the old one, and its authors ""will surely try to justify and demonstrate why the previous one was inadequate"".

According to the specialist, Act 447 may have a very negative impact on mutual Polish-American relations. - Behind the ocean there will be an incredible escalation of media and government accusations of anti-Semitism and the ill will of Poles. This will be demonstrated by their resistance to the claims of Jewish organizations. The Polish population will answer beautiful for being similar. The Government of the Republic of Poland will try to mitigate the situation, but the pressure will not end until the claims for compensation are fulfilled. Warsaw should send this bill to Berlin. Maybe then the operation will end. At least for some time - said prof. Chodakiewicz.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/7twph4/the_adoption_of_bill_447_justice_for/dtfsagp/,slopeclimber,1517269614

6418,"Business might be the most popular major, but on the other hand all of the social science, arts and humanities departments are usually very left-leaning.

I've actually studied BWL and I can't recall ever really having gotten unbridled capitalism as in the right-wing libertarian sense, I'd describe it more as ""capitalism with a socialist twist"", because everything in the German BWL curriculum is focused on social market economy, because, well, that's what the country is running on.

So it's really a mixture of classical left- and right-wing topics coming together in business studies. Capitalism is not an inherently right-wing concept anyway and all of Europe just practices capitalism with varying degrees of typically left-wing socialist policies anyway.

Let's look at the first sentence of Wikipedia's article on ""[right-wing politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics)"":

&gt;Right-wing politics hold that certain social orders and hierarchies are inevitable, natural, normal or desirable,[1][2][3] typically supporting this position on the basis of natural law, economics or tradition.

In my experience, there are *vastly* more fields of study at almost all Western universities that question social orders and hierarchies of whatever kind instead of acknowledging and accepting them. Even just mentioning that a natural order exists in some topics might get you ostracized as sexist / racist / ableist / [insert buzzword]. Traditions are only there to be overthrown ever since postmodernism crept into universities. Try publicly outing yourself as a right-wing nationalist at a German university and see how that goes - not very well probably, as the vast majority of the student body is usually very leftist, too. 

A typical example from of regressive leftism on steroids supported by tax payer money from my old uni:

https://www.uni-hamburg.de/piasta/kontakt/team/andrea-vicky-amankwaa-birago.html

And as I've written in previous comments, this is a reason why I'd say Brexit is so awful for the EU.  It's not just the immediate impact on finances and whatnot. it means that every country that might be discontent over any political moves in Brussels is now weighing ""life with the UK vs life with the EU"" instead of ""isolation vs life with the EU"".  The next Le Pen in whatever country has a prettier alternative.

It not only degrades cohesion, but Brussels has political capital equal to only how much any one of her members prefers being in than out.  By decreasing that, it makes it harder for her to act.

Looking back on the Cameron-Merkel talks, I wish that there had been some way to redirect intra-EU migration to Germany, who badly needs it, than to the UK, which was teetering on the political brink over it.  I dunno why people head to the UK.  If it's the English language, as some Portuguese student on here was talking about recently (""I'm not going to go to a country where I can't use English or Portuguese""), maybe find some state in Germany that would have been willing to mandate that everything be bilingual and figure out a way to shunt people in.

[Here's a little map about the cost of Russian gas in EU.](http://i.imgur.com/iJvdTY8.png)

Part of the deal with Germany includes a clause that they cannot resell that gas to their neighbors for lower price than Russia offers.

And so the deal is that Germany gets gas extra cheap at the expense of other EU countries paying more (which also helps in dividing EU politically). 
The fact that nordstream goes around Poland (a more expensive option BTW) also ensures that Poland will keep paying more and is seen as an attack on their energetic security. That pipeline going through Poland would also ensure that in case of armed conflict they could cut off the supply to the rest of Europe which would cut some money off of Russia and make the rest of Europe care more at the same time (unlikely scenario but still it's a nice thing to have).

There is more than that, but basically it is seen as Russia selling gas extra cheap to Germany in order to keep everyone else down, and Germany seems fine with it.

For example, I have an American friend with Italian heritage who often refers to herself as “Italian,” and obviously that is a case of self-racism. I also know an American who calls herself Croatian and another American who calls himself Indian. I can barely stand to be in the same room with those racists. Worse yet, they seem unclear about the distinction between their ethnicity and the country where their parents grew up. 

&gt;But right-and-wrong aside, is it a good legal strategy for Trump to sow doubts about the objectivity of the robot judge? It seems to me that the trial can go one of two ways.

&gt;1. Trump wins in court, in which case, Trump wins.

&gt;2. Trump loses in court, in which case, Trump says Democrats rigged the system to give him an unfair trial. We’re already primed to believe it.

&gt;From a legal perspective, race is not a reason to remove a judge. I haven’t heard anyone argue otherwise. But from a persuasion perspective, Trump is setting the stage for whatever is to come. So yes, it is smart, albeit offensive.

6658,"&gt; Also using the ESC as any kind of metric is just not serious. 

You are missing the point. The definition of things that aren't purely scientific is based on culture. If a country is constantly perceived to be European then it essentially becomes a reality. E.g. most Europeans see Cyprus as many European aren't even aware that it's outside Europe. Turkey is also interesting. Currently the country is culturally shifting away from Europe but this could go the other way round at some point, e.g. Turkey EU membership used to be a more realistic scenario than it is now. If Turkey changes again and became more liberal and democratic it could easily become full ""European"". Basically at some point people will be ""yeah, maybe geographically they aren't in Europe, but who cares, they are like us"". This is essentially what happened with Cyprus. So events like the ESC or sports events do matter because they influence the perception, which ultimately influences politics. E.g. most people see Israel as more ""European"" than Turkey even though Israel is further away and also has a different religion but they are overall more Western.",,/r/europe/comments/7tsc1f/noneuropean_countries_in_europe/dtf5stw/,zh1K476tt9pq,1517248202

Is it because of the language, with english companies having access to more users from the get-go?

Is it the lack of regulation that there is in the US, allowing companies to operate more freely? Is having our companies amongst those giants worth losing the protection that we enjoy as citizens?

Uh...how exactly? And who is the designator calling countries “developing”? And what are the metrics? 

I’ve been to fantastic cities that missionaries call “developing” for the dumbest reasons. They’re not developing, it’s a different culture. I’ve been to countries that are poor as hell that have had missionaries visiting for centuries now and they haven’t done anything but yet still somehow went back to their churches exclaiming they did God’s Work when in reality they half-built a house, ran out of funds, spouted some bible verses at people who don’t speak xyz language, then buggered off feeing good about themselves. Meanwhile the house was torn down and repurposed because supplies were rare. 

Not negating the few good missionaries who actually did make a difference but overall the mission isn’t about helping people as a whole but rather spreading their faith to other people who aren’t from the same country.

&gt;There are two scenarios that I think are bad and can't be solved by trading with Russia:

&gt;1) Russia becomes agressive on the world stage in countries that aren't the EU/NATO but still close to or partners of these institutions.

&gt;2) Russia destabilizes politics all over Europe without any sanctioning and creates unrest. Then they will take potential opportunities to escalate these situations, until the gain from open opposition to EU/NATO outweigh trade relations.

But then:

&gt;&gt;Economically isolated Russia is times more dangerous than Russia trading with the EU. Cutting the biggest Russian income source - gas and oil trade - will make Putin more likely to act aggressively.

&gt;That's fine with me. How much mroe agressive does he want to get? He clearly does have a shred of respect left for EU and NATO, otherwise he would have invaded those too by now. other than that, he is already invading his neighbours. There is not much else left to be ""more agressive"".

&gt;&gt;This will likely only increase ""misinformation campaign"". Putin and his group are afraid of any internal opposition, supporting such opposition will not be tolerated by him.

6764,"I'm not ideologically against all SoEs in all instances. But there is a gradient here. It's not either/or. SoEs are often very useful in the early stages of rapid industrial growth, when the goal of the economy is to do massive capital accumulation. Italy post-WWII is a good example, in part because of the devestation of the war but also because Italy even pre-WWII was not at the leading edge.

Once you reach higher sophistication of your economy, SoEs can still be useful but less so. Korea and Taiwan both relied heavily on SoEs but over time shifted power to private companies (though in both cases, many of these private companies had tight connections to the government). Even in the West, some companies have government influence. Boeing in the US is a good example. German autocompanies in Germany is another. This is normal.

But neither the US nor Germany has these levels of direct control over *huge* swathes of the economy. South Korea, Taiwan and Japan all have more SoE involvement than most Western countries but even they have moved much more in a pro-market direction the last 30 years.

It seems you tend to generalize really easily and that your knowledge of history and culture is rather poor. 

Slavs (such as Serbs here) were also victims of forced conversions to Christianity as well as forced conversions to Islam, before this they were pagans, and they converted quite lately (middle age), so your ""thousand years"" again does not make any sense.

Some other more ancient European people like the Balts, the Saami or my own people (the Basques) converted even more lately, and were victims of mass conversion and mass slaughter until the 17th century, almost as the same moment as Native Americans (see witch hunt under De Lancres and Basque paganism for Basques, and the crusade against Balts and the Saami religion).

6891,"General background: Skai is a right-leaning media company owned almost in its entirety by a Greek oligarch/shipowner named Giannis(John) Alafouzos. Political leaning and/or ownership interests do not align with the current government's agenda.

[1]: Before SYRIZA/ANEL coalition came into power, a crucial vote for assigning the next President of Democracy took place in late 2014. The vote demands 2/3 of the votes in parliament (200) or 3/5 (180) in the third and last vote cast after two consecutive failed casts. SYRIZA announced it would effectively boycott the procedure by not voting for any candidate in order to cause snap elections (as was done). The graph shows the public opinion in the question ""In March 2015 the Greek Parliament will be called to elect a new President. Which of the following outcomes do you regard as best for the country?"", with 43% (in green) answering ""The current Parliament should elect the next President"", 49.5% (in red) ""Parliament should dissolve, new elections should be announced and the next Parliament should elect the President"" and 7.5% ""Don't Know/Won't Answer"". Note that this is actually the second attempt to elect a President, this time with SYRIZA/ANEL coalition in government. Generalised political instability was apparently an even worse outcome than a ""government of the left"".

[2]: That's a graph depicting the 10-year-bond spread fluctuations within a week during October. Don't remember the exact occasion, but ""spreads drop, everything is going well"" is clearly what they want to show.

[3]: Graph shows the recorded assaults in a region of Athens (Eksarchia) by year. It's not even that 27 is obviously smaller than 57, it's that the former represents only the first quarter of 2017. For additional context, Eksarchia is ""the root of all evil"" for New Democracy, a very convinient example of ""unlawfulness"" and ""general anarchy"" that the current government supports/does not care about, and they pledge to unroot once in power.

Uh, I think you misunderstood me. China is effectively buying up EU member states with its investments, making the member state economically dependant on the goodwill of the Chinese government.  Therefore the member state governments will try to keep favour with the Chinese government and will affect EU legislation in order to keep all of the EU countries as a buffet for the Chinese companies, be they state or private.

7122,"Today, Finnish Presidency is largely a ceremonial one. The most important task The President has is keeping good relations with other countries. Here are a few ""interesting"" statistics about just that:

Lauri Kristian Relander was commonly called ""Travel Lasse"" for his many visits to foreign states. Whereas his predecessor Ståhlberg had zero official state visits to foreign countries, Relander had a whopping 5. Three to other Nordic states, two to Baltic states. This is understandable though, because back then The President had a powerful stance in domestic politics and less time to do all that ""nonsense foreign relations mumbo-jumbo"".

Kekkonen, Finland's own Supreme Leader, made 123 official and unofficial visits to foreign states during his 26 year rule (includes private holiday travels). Known for his skillful handling of ""Eastern relations"", Kekkonen made 35 visits to the Soviet Union. To balance this, he equaled that by as many visits to Norway, Sweden and Denmark. USA had the pleasure of welcoming Kekkonen state-side 4 times, one of them being an official state visit which ended with [a well documented holiday in Hawaii.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_Crisis)

Martti Ahtisaari, an established foreign relations master and a Nobel Peace Prize winner, visited a grand total of 129 states (both official and unofficial state visits) during his 6 year term. Before his Presidency Ahtisaari played an important part in the independence of Namibia and he received an honorary Namibian citizenship in 1992. Legend says Martti is a somewhat popular name given to children in Namibia.

~~Conan O'Brien~~ Tarja Halonen, Niinistö's predecessor, made 32 state visits during her 12 year period as The President.

During his first 6 years, Niinistö made 13 state visits and traveled to 32 different states so stats-wise he is equaling Halonen's pace.

Statistically Ahtisaari is king here, the dude placed the yard-pole so far I doubt any President will ever triumph that. Niinistö is equaling also Kekkonen's pace with ~5 travels/year but I suspect Sauli's numbers will go down during his second term as he is about to have a newborn. So, it's up to Lennu to do the more important state visit stuff.

7128,"This isn’t entirely accurate. The president has less power in comparison to before the constitutional reforms in 2000, when the office could be compared to that of the president of France, but the Finnish presidency certainly isn’t a ceremonial role. The president still manages Finland’s foreign policy outside the EU, and appoints many of the key civil servants as well as members of the judiciary. The Finnish constitution also relies on convention to a relatively great extent, and because of this the president still has a lot of influence in government(being part of it) - although the prime minister is regarded as having the last say, the president still has the nuclear option of using convention as a form of veto(this in response to governmental decrees, not parliamentary legislation, where the parliament has the power to override a veto through a second vote). This would undoubtedly trigger a constitutional crisis, but the option is there.

7156,"Oh yeah. But I've never seen tea zombies. Seen plenty of coffee zombies firsthand. I drink tea or I don't drink tea. I like the taste, but I don't miss it when I don't drink it. Plus, I usually drink it in the evening, I don't ever drink it to wake up. Hell, I sleep in spite of it, and I fall asleep right away and never wake up till I have to, at which point I feel great, I don't mind waking up extremely early, if I need to. It's great to feel great about your own sleep -- and I've never had a bad dream since I was 6, so I sleep very peacefully too. No issues with caffeine interference at all. 

&gt;Most tea actually has more caffeine than coffee. 

Blatantly false. Technically true, yes, tea itself has more caffeine. However, the way we prepare it means that caffeine is extracted very efficiently from coffee beans, whereas tea is a piss in the water comparatively. Highest caffeine teas are black ones usually, 40mg of caffeine. Average coffee is higher than 100mg, but depending on the coffee, you can get over 400mg, and I'm not talking about some obscure devil's brew, but literally a Starbucks. Here is another issue: I've never seen someone serially drink tea in a single instance just to function, whereas many do so with coffee. People can have two cups of that 400mg caffeine coffee from Starbucks over the course of morning-lunch period. 

Moreover, I am a huge fan of chamomile (Romashka) and linden-flower tea (Lipa) which are extremely popular in Eastern Europe, as well as rosehip tea. None have caffeine and I like them just as much. Additionally, green tea is really weak caffeine wise (15-30mg typically), even though most green teas you will find in store have hardly any flavour, tastes like drinking hot water, or hot water with sugar.",Apparently Serbia according to /u/cLnYze19N,/r/europe/comments/7toy5a/american_christian_missionary_goes_to_serbia_nis/dtej6gc/,Aemilius_Paulus,1517212864

This reduces death camps to just an element of a war between nations, which has happened all the time throughout history, while omitting the aspect of 'purification' of society they were supposed to achieve. Holocaust doesn't fit into a neat box of 'nation X against nation Y' and we shouldn't ram it there.

&gt; Furthermore, taking power over a state isn't required to build a death camp or to commit a genocide. See: ISIS.

Aren't they running a state as they take over land? They are a state - just one that isn't recognised by anyone and not going to last very long. 

&gt; Even furthermore, we don't know what future will bring, maybe nazis will come again to power? See: Ukraine.
