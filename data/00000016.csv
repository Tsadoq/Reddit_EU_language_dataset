* [Usually you see photos of it which emphasize the lonely position on the hairpin bend.]( https://i.imgur.com/6FGyGQ3.jpg)

* [This drone video gives a good idea of the location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4LvoMIXbS8).

* Due to the altitude it was only open for 4 months in the summer (June-September) to take advantage of the pass traffic.

* [Being a mountain pass in Switzerland there is of course an artillery emplacement right above the hotel (Artilleriefestung Galenhütten).]( https://i.imgur.com/IfLkVuZ.png) If the hotel ever does reopen you can sleep safe knowing you have your own defensive position incase the French or Italians invade overnight.

This is one place I have yet to actually pass by – I tend to avoid popular road pass areas, if only because of the noise pollution. Hopefully next year I will fit in a bike tour from Andermatt over the Furka and then Grimsel passes, to then follow the Aare back home.

It is surprisingly hard to find much information about it (not helped by the name being commonplace in Switzerland). The official website ( http://www.gletscher.ch/ ) is very bare bones. The main source of information in English are ‘interesting location’ articles from places like [amusingplanet]( https://www.amusingplanet.com/2018/11/hotel-belvedere-iconic-swiss-hotel-at.html). Though I wouldn’t trust these, mostly they just (badly) translate information from German articles and have many errors.

**Not abandoned, but closed with no set date to reopen.**

As far as I can tell the hotel was last open for the summer season of 2014.

The most useful news stories are from [HTR.ch in 2015](https://www.htr.ch/story/hotel-belvedere-am-furkapass-voruebergehend-geschlossen-14187.html) which puts the initial closure down to a rockfall blocking an important road at the start of the summer season, which combined with a strong Swiss Frank keeping visitors away led the owners to keep to closed for the rest of that summer. And from the [1815.ch in 2016](https://www.1815.ch/news/wallis/aktuell/hotel-belvedere-in-gletsch-auch-diesen-sommer-geschlossen/) where the story is that the Carlen family owners who had run the hotel themselves were now looking for a new tenant to take over the running of the hotel. The interview with the SRF (see below) backs this up with the owner saying he is too busy with his job as a lawyer and his looking for someone to take it on.

Another of the English speaking articles claims it was in part due to the retreating glacier disturbing the foundations. But that doesn’t make any sense and is not mentioned anywhere else.

**Hotel**

The hotel which first appeared in 1882, just after the pass road was opened, is one of the last of the grand Belle Époque hotels from that period and apparently still has all the original designs and items. From some accounts the hotel seemed to be somewhat past its best and in need of a bit of restoration [(even their own website makes it look that way)]( http://www.gletscher.ch/hotel-restaurant/).

* [Detailed history (in German)](https://www.historischehotels.ch/aktuelle-berichte/hotel-belvedere-am-furkapass/).

* [SRF bei di lut, goms (SRF, 2015)]( https://youtu.be/dhOpF6Uuu-o?t=2237) shows some of the interior and has an interview with the Philipp Carlen who owns the hotel (assuming your Swiss-German is up to scratch).

* If you want a time capsule Belle Époque hotel there are a number still going like the Rosenlaui near Meiringen or Kurhaus in Bergün.

**The Rhone glacier**

More concerning/interesting than the hotel itself is how the Rhone glacier next to it has retreated in the meantime.

When the hotel was originally built the Rhone glacier cascaded (in as much as a glacier can) right by the pass road to the valley floor below (appropriately named Gletschboden - glacier floor) almost to the hamlet at Gletsch. The images from then are really impressive, and even were so into the 1960s. [Now it is partly covered in reflective blankets to try and reduce the melt rate](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/climate-change_scientist-predicts-30--of-swiss-glacier-ice-could-be-saved/44333342). The melting glacier has left a lake by the hotel (see the start of the drone video at the top) [which is predicted to grow in size and the idea of having boat tours on it has been disscussed](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/melting-glacier-could-draw-tourists/6051254).

* ['Old' vs 'Recent' comparison image.](https://i.imgur.com/lk0cyyx.jpg)

* The Rhone glacier also gave the Glacier Express its name. Not only is the glacier no longer visible from below but the train been routed away from that section anyway.

**What is there?**

* The main attraction is the pass itself [(typically open from June-October)](https://www.myswissalps.com/car/trafficinfo), which is often combined with the Grimsel and Susten passes in a single day loop [(even by road bike)]( https://www.cyclingstage.com/tour-de-suisse-2019/stage-9-route-tds-2019/), so most other people passing by will be tourists.

* There is a [Glacier grotto](http://www.gletscher.ch/eisgrotte/) (9 CHF adult price) where you can walk into a tunnel drilled 100m into the glacier. The walk to the entrance will get longer each year.

* There is also a snack stand.

* There isn’t much else to do there. [There is a marked footpath which leads up from the Hotel to the top of the pass, but it is a dead end by foot otherwise](https://map.schweizmobil.ch/?lang=en&amp;photos=yes&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;logo=yes&amp;season=summer&amp;resolution=4.5&amp;E=2673197&amp;N=1158444&amp;layers=Wanderland).

**Can you get there by public transport?**

[Yes](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2D7FF7A/yellow-swiss-bus-on-road-at-closed-hotel-belvedere-furka-pass-switzerland-2D7FF7A.jpg), as with just about all the passes in Switzerland there is a (limited) bus service. Even though it is barren landscape and the pass road is now a needless diversion on a road that has been replaced by the Furka tunnel for faster train transport. A few buses a day run on the route Oberwald - Andermatt via the ‘Belvedere Furka’ stop during the summer.

You could try and time the buses so that you can catch one going back the way you came without waiting for too long. Otherwise you could hike up to the pass and then down to Realp or Oberwald where you can catch a train (about 13km, +400m, -1100m either way).

**Where do you park?**

[The extensive parking area directly underneath where the main shot is taken by drone]( https://i.imgur.com/ieeg0ik.jpg) (why is it so hard for people to google the title?).

**How do you cross the road?**

It is a blind 180 hairpin turn. How fast do you think people are driving?

**James Bond**

[The hotel and pass appeared in Goldfinger (1964).]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1KZOSGIOUM) Very very briefly in the case of the hotel. It is interesting to note that even then the glacier was still very visible from the hotel.

Sean Connery apparently stayed there often and was responsible for the inclusion in the film (not found any actual evidence of this though).",Actually living in Switzerland,/r/europe/comments/ntfv1a/hotel_belvédère_in_switzerland/h0rwcwg/,travel_ali,1622966727

251,"In China, propaganda is the curriculum.

I taught in universities. Teachers are prohibited to touch on certain topics and there are class ""monitors"" who can report you if you do. I was reprimanded for making factual statements such as ""many westerners consider Taiwan as a separate entity from the P.R.C."" in a lecture about Intercultural Communication, but I had colleagues who actually lost their job. Subsequently, I refused to take on similar courses and eventually resigned altogether.

&gt; I find it hard to believe that all Chinese unies work just like that

It's not only universities but their entire educational system is designed to ingrain in students that the CCP is the only legitimate ruler of China. Courses on ""Marxism"" are only the most visible manifestation of propaganda. For example critical thinking is another very difficult topic to broach because students are mostly required to passively accept the teacher's authority.

There are strange culture connections between germany and the american south which have lasted for many centuries now. In the 19th century anti-slavery symbols were adopted in germany, but in the early 20th century these same symbols were used as ''proof'' for the blacks now supposed inferiority. The 19th century distaste for slavery melted away and resistance to it became much more elastic.

Many of the higher ups of the nazi party believed that the confederatie was the real america, and that the american government was an imposter.

375,"The city was called Petrograd at the time.Following the October Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks abolished the old Tsarist legal code and with it the criminalization of homosexuality.While there was significant support in the Party to tolerate or even support gay rights with even the People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs  being an openly gay man, it was still largely considered perverse by most.Starting in the late 1920’s, attitudes and policy on the subject soured, and in 1934 sex between men could lead up to a five year sentence (there was no such law for women).

This photo was actually taken by the police following a raid:

&gt;The  report of the head of the Criminal Investigation Department of  Petrograd Kramer, drawn up on January 15, 1921, states that according to  ‟unofficial information” in the house in Simeonovskaya Street 6, apt. 1 ‟there is a different audience with unnatural goals.”  
&gt;  
&gt;With the search warrant in the apartment, the police officers arrived and ‟as such, they found 95 men, often dressed as women ...Part of the crowd was drunk;  before entering the apartment from the windows of such, something poured out. On the windowsill of one of the windows where the guests were, the team  found an incomplete bottle of ether, and a wedding veil was found on the floor.”  The dactyloscopic bureau, at the request of the Fearing Officers, took a group picture right on the spot ...

None of the people pictured in this photo were convicted of a crime, but the owner of the apartment was charged with procurement, maintaining a brthel, and recruitment of women for prostitution.It’sn’t clear if these charges were proved based on this event or unrelated evidence.",,/r/europe/comments/ntb33j/a_group_of_homosexuals_crossdressers_and/h0r7cz3/,darinaedgar,1622947753

702,"&gt;Lol, Japan has the worlds highest debt at 241% GDP (they are doing fine btw), you have no idea what you are talking about.

Everyone know Japan debt is owned by the BOJ and Japaneses people. The japanese treasury create debt securities and the BOJ buy it. **Japan has little debts**. What's important is that Japan is a net exporter and you're a net importer. You can run your massive deficit because the USD is the world reserve currency.


&gt;The dollar is the reserve currency of the world, and the Federal Reserve is not under the German delusion that the Euro Central Bank is (i.e. the world functions like the gold standard is still a thing), so there is nothing to worry about. 


I fail to see why you brought that up. I also don't understand what you wanted to say about Germany. Germany is fine. 


&gt;I mean look at Europe trying to get around the dollar to trade with Iran, it didn't work at all.


As far as I know, european companies got sanctioned for using USD not for trying to get around it.


&gt;Anyway, have you ever heard the saying that if you owe the bank 1M$, you're fucked, you f you owe the bank 1T$, the bank is fucked?


Yes, but it's incomplete and idiotic like most *sayings*. The bank is fucked if the debtor default on its debt. For us, mere mortals, we're not allowed to print money. But the USA can print money and people must accept the monopoly money because... world reserve currency and yadayada. In that context your saying is not appropriate.


&gt;Also, rates are so low now that interest costs are eating less money than ever.


Again, I fail to see why you brought that up. Everyone know that. Interest rates have been falling since the 80's, so you can repay your debt with cheaper depts. It never ended well tho'. But we're talking about 50-70 years cycles, so the joke can probably continue for 10 to 30 years. 


&gt;You need our dollar and you need our defense, and you know that your place is acting like a good little boy for Uncle Sam. If you don't believe me, just ask some Russians or Chinese.

&gt; To put it bluntly the Moravian territories were a bit too north...

I clearly stated Great Moravia crumbled and territory of Slovakia got subjugated. How have you managed to misunderstand that? I'll try it simpler:

Great Moravia stopped existing because of Hungarian expansion. Part of Great Moravia, which is currently Slovakia, got subjugated by Hungarians. This is something children learn at elementary school. How do you not know this?!

Great Plains region is in North America and not relevant to this discussion. If you mean Carpathian/Pannonian basin then no, it wasn't.

974,"There are no ""you people"". I don't necessarily share the same views as the other commentators.

Let me dissect your comment stream so that you may understand how we came to argue with you on this matter.

Originally you wrote that there is a contradiction in freely switching the terms ""Citizens of Europe"" and ""Citizens of the EU"". u/rusticarchon rightly pointed out that there is no ambiguity in the concept since ""EU citizenship"" is the only form of citizenship possible on a European level. I expanded on this idea in my long comment, explaining how citizenship is defined and how you can't speak of a swiss being a ""European citizen"". We are being pendantic here, yes. To be clear, a better description would be: ""a Swiss is a citizen in a European country"", or ""a Swiss is European"". So going on in the conversation, you question the existence of such a ""EU citizenship"" in the first place - that is very good question, because we don't have such documents that give us that name explicitly. Again u/rusticarchon gives an explanation which you confirmed to have understood. However in your second paragraph you want to go back to the topic of a ""non-existent eu citizenship"". Here the problem lies. You had mentioned ""european citizenship"" in your original comment, since you didn't understand how it was being loosely interchanged with the idea of ""EU citizenship"". u/rusticarchon already explained to you that this but you are going in a circle by asking this question again. This is where it gets confusion. u/rusticarchon repeats himself but he goes into slightly more detail and even gives you a example where a name cannot be used to ambiguously describe the nation of a citizen. You reply with a ""yes but..."" argumentation. By the ""yes"" you understand now that ""european citizenship"" and ""EU citizenship"" are interchangeable notions, in the ""but"" you try to understand how a swiss can however still be a ""european citizen"" though. My answer touched on that subject saying that using these pendantic terms there is no such thing as a swiss ""european citizen"" - I hope you understood why from my comment. Your reply to that shows me that you did not understand my point. This is a false statement: ""And since Switzerland is in Europe, that person is a European citizen."" 

The Asia topic is slightly off-topic, but I wanted you to understand that you couldn't use that analogy. The concept of ""Asia"" doesn't exist from a japanese perspective as an example. The idea of a European continent only exists from a European perspective - when foreigners refer to Europe they refer to a cultural region on the geological continent of Eurasia.

And you think the Russians had not experienced opression, famine and dictatorhip in the S.U? Yes, they would and they did, so did Russian communists to Russians.

1006,"Tisza; His initial opposition to the conflict, only became public after the end of World War 1, on 17 October 1918, when he spoke in the Parliament. He said, ""the Monarchy and the Hungarian nation were longing for peace all the way until there were proofs that the enemy was systematically trying to humiliate and destroy us as soon as possible (...) As we have found proofs that the Serbian government took part in organising the assassination, we could not but address an ultimatum to Serbia ... where we stipulated that the war is preventive.""

This is the full context; ""Tisza opposed the expansion of the empire on the Balkan (see Bosnian crisis in 1908), because ""the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs"", which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy.\[20\]  
In March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Francis Joseph. His letter had a strongly apocalyptic, predictive and embittered tone. He used the expression ""Weltkrieg"" (meaning World War) - a term hitherto unknown - in his letter. ""It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors \[Russia and France\] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front.""\[21\]  
On the day of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, Tisza immediately traveled to Vienna where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Berchtold and Army Commander Conrad von Hötzendorf. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking Serbia. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to Franz Joseph saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war.\[22\] He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics. After a successful war against Serbia, Tisza adumbrated a possible Austrian military attack against Kingdom of Hungary, where the Austrians want to break up the territory of Hungary.\[23\] He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the Second Italian War of Independence. He also felt the threat of Romania and Bulgaria after the Balkan wars and was afraid of Romanian attack from the east, while Austro-Hungarian forces had to fight against the Russian Empire and maybe against Italy. He was also not sure about the stand of the Germans. Germany's stand was of ultimate importance due to the security of the state.  
During a conversation between Franz Joseph and Conrad von Hötzendorf, Hötzendorf asked, ""If Germany's reply is that they are on our side, do we engage in war with Serbia?"" The emperor replied, ""Then yes"", ""But what if they reply differently?"", ""Then the Monarchy will be alone"".  
Kaiser Wilhelm II supported the war, promised to neutralize a Romanian attack, and put pressure on Sofia. After this, Tisza still sought a peaceful solution, but most of all he wanted to wait for the result of the official investigation into the assassination. The only proposal of Tisza, which was accepted, was that the Monarchy should not annihilate Serbia completely in order to avoid Russian support for Serbia. The council finally addressed an ultimatum to the Serbian government and immediately commenced mobilisation of troops.  
After sending the ultimatum, his view changed. The ultimatum had expired after 48 hours, so Tisza wrote: ""it was a difficult decision to take a stand to propose war, but now I am firmly convinced of its necessity""\[24\] He was, however, still opposed to the annexation of Serbia to the Monarchy, but failed. On 4 August 1914 Russia, Germany, Britain and France also entered the war, enlarging it to a world war.  
Tisza did not resign as Prime Minister, as he thought that, with his connections in Vienna, remaining in this position was the best way he could represent Hungarian interests inside Austria-Hungary. Moreover, his resignation would have sent a message of weakness to the Entente at the outbreak of war.  
His initial opposition to the conflict, only became public after the end of World War 1, on 17 October 1918, when he spoke in the Parliament. He said, ""the Monarchy and the Hungarian nation were longing for peace all the way until there were proofs that the enemy was systematically trying to humiliate and destroy us as soon as possible (...) As we have found proofs that the Serbian government took part in organising the assassination, we could not but address an ultimatum to Serbia ... where we stipulated that the war is preventive.""

But as such current romanian culture has as much in common with daco-roman culture, as hungary has in common with our hunter gatherer cousins in siberia.

Your current culture has its roots in vallachia, moldavia, and other  buffer states between the ottomans and kingdom of hungary.And outside some very creative fictional interpretations the mountains of transsilvania (which barely host humans to this day - compared to the surrounding areas), were not the scene of of evil hun-garians massacring the mountain tribes in the millions.

And yes, every fucking pussible ethnicity in the areas around hungary was very much welcome after wars  devastated the population.We have plenty of german ethniclly villages, same with croats, and various other slavic groups.Hell we have a region that used to be set aside from nomadic cumans, who got invited into the country after the mongol invasion decimated the population.

1155,"And if you get your foot in the door, you at least have the chance of making some business and/or political connections to profit somewhat from the situation.

Look at video games for example, there's thousands of clones of LoL or WoW or whatever the popular game is nowadays, but those companies are still making money hand over fist, and they're making more and more money year over year. The trick is, most of those western companies are working in China through intermediaries. Tencent, Netease, those are the guys running things on the ground on behalf of Blizzard or Riot and making sure things run smoothly. They have a vested interest in keeping those brands alive and not let them die under a pile of counterfeit clones.

Same goes with movies and basically anything cultural, yes they have a ton of piracy and Chinese remakes, but getting your movie/book/record released in China can still lead to a massive amount of cash going your way.

Software isn't that different, especially with Cloud services or hardware-tied ecosystems like the iPhone. Some [recent numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/apple-aapl-had-record-quarter-in-china-thanks-to-iphone-upgrades.html) shows that they just had a record quarter at the end of 2020 with 21 billion revenue and that's a 57% growth year over year. That's the crazy number here, 57%. From a moral standpoint, making business in China is abhorrent. But from a business standpoint? Apple would be braindead to throw that money out. Yes there's tons of counterfeit, yes their tech is being stolen, and there's no guarantee it will last, but in the meantime Apple is still making bank.

The Google situation is actually interesting, because Google didn't want to play ball in China. That's why they got banned and Baidu became the de facto leader. But what if Google played ball, made Winnie happy and bribed the right people? You could very well look at a Baidu/Google partnership where Google would make ton of money in the process.

There are definitely certain markets that will be immensely profitable for western companies in the future, even if it's through local intermediaries, even if it doesn't last and it's not without risk. But nothing in business is guaranteed to last or is without risk. That's the kind of bet you have to do. And right now, western companies are betting they can make a ton of money in China, and from what I can see, it's paying off.

1189,"**UK could threaten to pull out of EU's €100bn research programme amid Brexit deal row**

*Senior Government sources claim the EU is 'purposely going slow' on formalising the UK’s participation in Horizon Europe*

The UK could threaten to pull out of the EU's €100bn flagship research programme after Brussels was accused on Friday of holding up access in the latest act of ""political"" vengeance, The Telegraph can disclose.

In what looks set to become the next major political dispute between the two sides, senior Government sources have claimed that the EU is ""purposely going slow"" on formalising the UK’s participation in Horizon Europe.

Ministers are similarly frustrated at the progress of the UK’s association to Euratom Research and Training, the nuclear research programme linked to Horizon, and Copernicus, the earth monitoring satellite project.

The Government argues that the hold up and the decision to exclude the UK from shaping the programmes beyond what it had anticipated will negatively impact participants and has called into question their value for money.

The row is due to come to a head next week when Lord Frost, the Cabinet minister in charge of EU relations, takes part in the EU-UK Partnership Council, a joint-committee set up to oversee the implementation of the Brexit trade deal.

**No 10 has not ruled out withdrawing from EU programmes**

While Downing Street wants to remain in the programmes, The Telegraph understands that it has not ruled out withdrawing from them should the EU fail to resolve the dispute.

It comes as Brussels prepares next week to try and break the long-standing deadlock over the Northern Ireland Protocol by offering to remove barriers to British medicine supplies crossing the Irish Sea.

The EU is expected to set out the plan on Wednesday when the joint committee which oversees the protocol meets in London. It will involve changing EU law subject to agreement from member states as an olive branch in the tense negotiations.

Under the protocol, which prevents a hard Irish border, Northern Ireland continues to follow EU rules for medicines and medical equipment, meaning new checks are due to be imposed when a year-long grace period expires at the end of 2021.

Medicines made in Britain - which account for the vast majority imported into the province - will also have to have separate licenses, testing and inspections before they can be used.

British manufacturers of non-branded drugs have warned that generic medicines make up four out of every five medicines prescribed in the NHS, with supplies of drugs for cancer, epilepsy and diabetes at risk because of the cost of the extra red tape.

**EU to ramp up pressure on Britain**

However, in return, it is expected that Brussels will ratchet up pressure on the UK to agree to a firm timetable for introducing new checks and infrastructure at the border, as required under the protocol.

The EU has also pushed for the UK to align with its food safety and animal health rules, although it is now increasingly pessimistic of reaching an agreement.

Should the two sides fail to break the deadlock, EU member states have signalled they are increasingly willing to consider retaliatory measures, such as triggering dispute resolution procedures which could ultimately end in tariffs and suspending elements of the Brexit trade deal.

Last night a Government spokesman said: ""We have yet to receive any details of their position. When we do, we will consider it carefully.""

The UK secured associate membership to the Horizon programme as part of the Brexit trade deal, enabling British universities, companies and researchers to continue bidding for pan-European funding with other member countries.

Its predecessor, Horizon 2020, involved more than 100 countries around the world and provided about 11 per cent of research funding to UK universities.

However, the UK claims that formalising its participation in the latest programme should have begun a month ago and that the EU had agreed in the Brexit trade deal to do so at the earliest opportunity.

While the UK’s hand in shaping these programmes was always set to be limited after Brexit, the Government also claims that the level to which it has been shut out is higher than anticipated.
**
'Politically driven' response by EU**

The UK believes the delay is ""politically driven"" and an attempt by the EU to heap fresh pressure on the UK over the Northern Ireland Protocol, after it acted unilaterally to extend a series of grace periods to ease trade friction for firms moving a wide array of goods across the Irish Sea.

""The UK remains open to these programmes on the right terms, but the overall attractiveness is being called into question by the EU’s political point scoring,"" a senior Government source said last night.

""This approach goes against the requirements of the agreement reached with the EU just six months ago, and we expect a swift resolution.

""The delay is in no one’s interest because we can’t participate but they will lose out from our financial contribution to it.""","And did those feet in ancient time,",/r/europe/comments/nssr6z/uk_could_threaten_to_pull_out_of_eus_100bn/h0o788b/,Frogloggers,1622888704

Anyhow, these ppl here think that the us system would be applied to a unified Europe, which is silly. It needs it's own system and a lot of time, but i don't see why it won't work in the end.

Language is no problem. It's just like within Germany. Here, the local dialects are spoken less with each generation, but they are STILL strong enough so that someone from the north will just not understand someone from the south and vice versa. They have to resort to the commonly used ""high German"".

The same would happen here. English would ultimately take over, even without the uk in the boat. I actually think that helps in this context (taking the language of a minority). 
Even now, you just speak English to ppl from other states and you have very high chances that younger ppl will understand you. This will even improve more and more.

So releasing the patent would likely have no immediate effect, not until 12 months. And outside of countries like India, many countries would take much longer to produce the vaccines.

Now, look. The vaccines were produced in 10 months. That's a record. Do we really want to reduce incentives for pharma companies when another pandemic could hit any time?

And before we get angry at each other, let's just remind the question is complex. It's not because we maintain the patents that we are not supporting low income countries, there are other ways to do that.

with the current ID card or any other Finnish E-ID method. This is essentially compatibility layer on top of existing national IDs. You log in to the EU wide ""wallet"" with the national digital ID. Then you can use the EU wallet for various services.

Instead of complaining ""we have to target 14 different systems it is too much work"".

So incase of Finland.... on initializing the wallet app one would be redirected to the [Suomi.fi](https://Suomi.fi) identification service with all the identification options it provides.

&gt;Germany, Spain and France want to bring the new European fighter jet into the air together. Internally, the Bundeswehr says: a project dominated by Paris that the other two are supposed to pay for. In addition, there are hardly any ""innovative technological approaches"".
&gt;
&gt;The showcase project for a joint European fighter jet is met with reservations, according to ""Spiegel"". In a secret statement for the Defense Ministry, experts from the German Armed Forces procurement office in Koblenz come to the conclusion that the contract with France and Spain ""has to be renegotiated from a technical and economic point of view,"" as the news magazine reports. In its current form, the experts consider the contract to be ""not ready to be signed"".
&gt;
&gt;There is a ""significant risk that critical technologies are not made mature enough, not in good time or not sufficiently"" and that the deadlines cannot be met, ""Spiegel"" quotes from the paper. ""Innovative technological approaches"" are ""hardly recognizable"" anyway. This means that there is a risk ""that essential technologies will either not be considered at all or will only be considered in later phases and then not be financially viable"".
&gt;
&gt;""French Dominance""
&gt;
&gt;After months of wrangling, Germany, France and Spain agreed in principle on how to proceed with the FCAS air combat system in mid-May. At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron announced the agreement on the development of the new fighter jet, which will succeed the Eurofighter and the French Rafale from around 2040.
&gt;
&gt;In the opinion of the experts, ""structures and rules"" which ""are not in the German interest and almost exclusively satisfy French positions"" will be updated with the contract, ""Spiegel"" quotes from the report. This means that ""French dominance is very firmly anchored in the program"".
&gt;
&gt;According to the magazine, a secret status report from the Federal Ministry of Defense from last week comes to a similar assessment. It said that the ""strong French positioning"" would mean that the goal of ""developing a sixth generation fighter aircraft"" would be missed and that the project would instead become a ""Rafale Plus approach with German and Spanish budget funds"".",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/nso3pi/bundeswehr_fighter_jet_deal_not_ready_for/h0nkoph/,duisThias,1622869294

1492,"The My Lai massacre was one of the most horrific incidents of violence committed against unarmed civilians during the Vietnam War. A company of American soldiers brutally killed most of the people—women, children and old men—in the village of My Lai on March 16, 1968.

Between 347 and 504 unarmed people were killed by U.S. Army soldiers from Company C, 1st Battalion ... and Company B, 4th Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, 11th Brigade, 23rd (Americal) Infantry Division.  
  
Victims included men, women, children, and infants. Twenty-six soldiers were charged with criminal offenses, but only Lieutenant William Calley Jr., a platoon leader in C Company, was convicted. Found guilty of killing 22 villagers, he was originally given a life sentence, but served only three-and-a-half years under house arrest.

After the conviction, the White House received over 5,000 telegrams; the ratio was 100 to 1 in favor of leniency. In a telephone survey of the U.S. public, 79 percent disagreed with the verdict, 81 percent believed that the life sentence Calley had received was too stern, and 69 percent believed Calley had been made a scapegoat.

The only reason we know about it is because of a couple of U.S. servicemen who tried to halt the massacre and rescue the hiding civilians.

Why does this particular argument get repeated to oblivion. I mean, that doesn't need to be said, no? Of course releasing patents will not magically spawn millions of vaccines the next day.

Arguing that removing one obstacle doesn't solve an issue fully, and therefore we shouldn't be removing said obstacle at all, is absurd.

1637,"&gt;agree, both are related to white. It all comes dowm to a preference then. I still prefer poc over non-whites because it refers to people as they are, not to what they are not. Maybe it's better to ask poc what they prefer. The people in my life think both aren't great, but prefer poc.

But my point is that they are not a person of 'colour'. 'Colour' does not mean anything. Let me ask you a question: why are Chinese people and black people in this same category? Why are white people and Chinese people not in the same category? I would even say they look more alike.

Also, do people you know really prefer to be called 'mens / persoon van kleur'?

The reason why is because PoC is still a term that only makes sense from a white perspective, but it has an almost self-hating politically correct layer on it that I absolutely despise.

&gt;Refering to your third part. This is a subreddit dedicated to europe, a white dominated society. If we were talking about a different region of the earth, you'd have a point. White people would simple be poc there. But in this case, the poc we are talking about do have a shared struggle.

Then People of Color is even a worse term, because then it completely depends on your current location, or perhaps even the room you are in. What about if you are in a room with 2 black people, a chinese person and a white person? Who is the person of colour then? In contrast, it is completely clear who the non-white person is. That is why it is a better term.

&gt;Its not your place to draw a conclusion on how i view the world, i dont see it as white vs minorities. Merely as dominant vs minorities.

Well that is how the term 'poc' sees the world: as white vs. minorities. Also, seeing the world as 'dominant' vs. 'minorities' is also really vague and unhelpful I would say. Are whites a minority or dominant in the world? What about in Amsterdam? But this is a different discussion.

&gt;Non-white is definitely a catagory. If white is a catagory then so is the abscence of white, or non white.

This is a rather semantic issue, but I would not say it is a category. A category would imply some shared characteristic that they have. A category does not imply something they *do not* have.

France has explicitly ruled out merging wirh the Tempest project, but I haven't seen Germany or Spain do so, so they've a Plan B.  And the UK has been actively soliciting partners, trying to get Japan in.

France wants CATOBAR capability for their new carrier, the [PANG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_French_aircraft_carrier).  The problem is that virtually no other countries want that capability themselves — Germany and Spain don't, and I expect that the export market is about nil.  When the US did the F-35, the tradeoffs on adding CATOBAR capability were significant-enough that it warranted the overhead of making a CATOBAR-capable variant to avoid impacting the non-CATOBAR variant.  I assume that FCAS would face the same limitations.  So it's probably harder to export a fighter that must support CATOBAR, because it's competing against non-CATOBAR fighters.  Limiting exports hurts scale.

France agreed to let Germany lead on the [MGCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Ground_Combat_System) conditional on France leading the FCAS. So France would presumably pull out of that if FCAS falls through.  But I'm pretty sure that that's a much smaller, less-ambitious project than FCAS, so I'm not sure how much of a bargaining chip that actually is.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/nsihv0/not_in_germanys_interest_bundeswehr_fighter_jet/h0mtilj/,duisThias,1622853614

[Why COVID vaccines are so difficult to compare](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00409-0)

&gt;Despite the widespread roll-out of several vaccines, it could be months before they can be ranked.

&gt;It might be tempting, but it simply isn’t possible to directly compare the effectiveness of vaccines on the basis of those results alone, cautions David Kennedy, who studies the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. Each measure of efficacy comes with a degree of uncertainty, and trials might have differing definitions of important criteria, such as what constitutes a ‘severe’ bout of COVID-19 compared to a ‘moderate’ one.


And PHE has concluded that they have the same efficiency.

1831,"&gt; Point to the comment where I claimed that

Here:

&gt;God know who lived there before that

In reality, archeological evidence points to Slavic setlemments, [who were the ancestors of Slovaks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovaks#Ethnogenesis)

&gt;*The final fall of the Avar Khaganate allowed new political entities to arise. The first such political unit documented by written sources is the Principality of Nitra, one of the foundations of later common ethnic consciousness.*

&gt;*The Principality of Nitra become a part of Great Moravia, a common state of Moravians (Czech ancestors were joined only for a few years). The relatively short existence of Great Moravia prevented it from suppressing differences which resulted from its creation from two separate entities, and therefore a common ""Slovak-Moravian"" ethnic identity failed to develop.*

&gt;*The early political integration in the territory of present-day Slovakia was however reflected in linguistic integration. While dialects of early ancestors of Slovaks were divided into West Slavic (western and eastern Slovakia) and non-West Slavic (central Slovakia), between the 8th and 9th centuries both dialects merged, thus laying the foundations of a later Slovak language.* 

&gt;*The 10th century is a milestone in the Slovak ethnogenesis. The fall of Great Moravia and further political changes supported their formation into a separate nation. At the same time, with the extinction of the Proto-Slavic language, between the 10th and 13th centuries Slovak evolved into an independent language (simultaneously with other Slavic languages).*

&gt;*The clear difference between Slovaks and Hungarians made adoption of a specific name unnecessary and Slovaks preserved their original name (in Latin e.g. Slavus), which was also used in communication with other Slavic peoples (Polonus, Bohemus, Ruthenus)*

1899,"*Consensual sexual relations between adults of the same sex has been legal in France for two centuries and this is usually attributed to the influence of Jean-Jacques-Régis de Cambacérès as second consul and then arch chancellor under Napoleon Bonaparte's government. However, Napoleon's government never showed itself particularly tolerant of homosexual activity and it was determined to enforce the highest moral standards in France. Though the law no longer penalized “crimes against nature”, the government never hesitated to take repressive action against pederasts and sodomites.*

And 

*Constituent Assembly by  Louis Michel le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau in 1791. Le Peletier drew a distinction between what he termed “true crimes” and offenses informed by “superstition, feudalism, the tax system, and despotism.” The new laws were predicated on the belief that private acts by private individuals were not a matter for state intervention, and blasphemy, witchcraft, heresy, sacrilege, and sodomy were all omitted and subsequently decriminalised. This made the 1791 penal code the first western law to decriminalise same-sex sexual activity since classical antiquity.*

That was a hell of a bold claim by the curator, completely unsupported by any evidence whatsoever. 

Decriminalization of strictly private, personal behavior and beliefs were obviously part of the liberalizing of the western world. But that pre-dated Napoleon by two full decades, and in particular arose with two other me. 

And once he rose to power, any excuse to crack down on outward displays of non-normative homosexuality was dealt with harshly.

1915,"&gt; Lol, according to your very own graph the EU has already achieved similar protection compared to the UK given that a one dose Pfizer is as effective as two doses of AZ.

You can always tell you aren't going to get the most insightful reply when the comment starts with 'lol' yet you still managed to disappoint my already low expectations. 

&gt;Compared to unvaccinated, vaccine effectiveness for 1 dose was estimated at 54%
(95% CI 50-58%) for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 53% (95%CI 49-57%) for the
Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Compared to 4 to 13 days post vaccination, this was 57%
(95%CI 53-61%) and 58% (95%CI 54-62%) respectively.   

&gt;After 2 doses, effectiveness was estimated as 90% (95%CI 82-95%) for the PfizerBioNTech vaccine and 89% (95%CI 78-94%) for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine
compared to unvaccinated. Compared to 4 to 13 days post vaccination, this was 91%
(95%CI 83-95%) and 90% (95%CI 80-95%) respectively.  

&gt;With the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine there is a small reduction in vaccine effectiveness
from 10 weeks after the first dose. This may be explained by some waning of protection
or by biases due to differences in the earliest groups who were vaccinated compared to
later groups. There is no evidence of this waning effect with the Oxford-Astrazeneca
vaccine.

Had things gone different in our history maybe wed still be as balkanized as in the pre-napoleon days or maybe thered be one union state.

They required US to join in order to succeed.

&gt;They are building a second one, and why would it be sunk in the first week of war and not the one from Russia (according to your link they have only one)

Survival rate for US carriers vs Russia is 48h. For all of them. French capabilities pale in comparison.

True king of the seas are submarines, carriers are for bombing 3rd world countries.

&gt;So according to yourself Rafale is at least 3-5 times more costly than Russian planes but is equivalent.

Rafale is 100m+ plane. Russian 5th generation is cheaper let alone the likes of mig's.

&gt; So I bet Egypt, India, Pakistan, Greece, Croatia might have been really stupid to buy some Rafael right ?

Pretty much yes. France is also known for kickbacks to politicians in order to get business. Other than that military deals are political, not about best gear per price.

&gt;Even Russia was buying some French equipment before Ukraine's crisis (where France stoped selling them two boats).

So? Its politics. And it was a ship with Russian equipment which France had to ship back to Russia.

&gt;Almost every military says that Rafale is one of the best plane available, and they have proven both in Syria and Libya to be indeed really useful.

Same was said of Leopards. Then they were sent to Syria.

Libya and Syria are both 3rd world countries with obsolete militaries. While they might get anti tank weapons, modern SAM's are expensive. Vs them a pilatus would be just as good.

&gt;Anyway I hope we will never know which is the stronger army and avoid an opposition. But the argument that French materials is 3-5 time more costly Russian for the same quality seems really odd isn't it ?

Why? French worker costs 5-8 times more than Russian one.

&gt;You should acknowledge and accept your colonial past and its present instead of finding ways to weasel out of responsibility for the actions of your country.

....

Wtf

Where and how do I even marginally suggest that I do not accept and acknowledge what happened????? Like, have you even read the final section of my previous comment? 

The shit that the Dutch of 1800 did is horrendous and hypocritical (undermining greater powers and  guaranteeing independence from them by subjugating others before them power could). 

The shit that is still going on in for example the [chocolate industry](https://www.republicofamsterdamradio.com/news/2020/11/29/history-of-the-netherlands-bonus-dark-chocolate-amsterdam-slavery-and-chocolate) (closely linked to Amsterdam) is horrendous 

Also.
 The ABC islands were first settled by Spain, and the indigenous Arawak peoples were largely decimated by Spain before the Dutch seized the islands.


On Curaçao no Arawak remained by the time the Dutch came along

Aruba: 
&gt; Those Arawak who had survived the depredations of the Spanish [on Aruba] were allowed to farm and graze livestock, with the Dutch using the island as a source of meat for their other possessions in the Caribbean
 
Bonaire:
&gt; The Spanish conquerors decided that the three ABC Islands were useless, and in 1515 the natives were forcibly deported to work as slaves in the copper mines of Santo Domingo on the island of Hispaniola.

On the SSS islands the situation is a bit more complex and poorly documented, and the chance is certainly higher dutch people did some shit to the natives there

Saint Martin (a bunch of _[citation needed]_ and I don't feel like piecing together a more complete picture):
&gt; The Caribs' territory was not completely conquered until the mid-17th century when most of them perished in the struggle between the French, English (later British), Dutch, Danes and Spanish for control of the West Indies islands around the Caribbean Sea.[citation needed]

Saba: also not a lot of info on wikipedia on what happened to the inhabitants, but just look at this timeline.
&gt; Christopher Columbus is said to have sighted the island on 13 November 1493, however, he did not land, being deterred by the island's perilous rocky shores.[9] In 1632 a group of shipwrecked Englishmen landed upon Saba.[9] Later, in 1635, a stray Frenchman claimed Saba for Louis XIII of France.[citation needed] In the 1640s the Dutch Governor of the neighbouring island of Sint Eustatius sent several Dutch families over to colonise the island for the Dutch West India Company.[9] In 1664, refusing to swear allegiance to the English crown, these original Dutch settlers were evicted to St. Maarten by Jamaican governors-cum-pirates Edward, Thomas, and Henry Morgan.[9][10] The Netherlands eventually gained complete control of the island in 1816.[9]

Saint Eustatius:

&gt; It is unclear if the island was inhabited by native peoples prior to European colonisation.

I strongly suggest you learn to read a wikipage or two, the quotes are straight from the islands' ""history"" sections on wikipedia
 
No, with regards to the natives in the carribean the Dutch hands are pretty much clean for as far as we know

No, the shit we actually need to accept, acknowledge and repent for are the genoiced and oppression committed in South East Asia, the slave trade transporting uncount millions from Africa's west coast to the new world, the fact that it took the dutch far longer than other major European nations, the fact that we created an institution that still functions as the primary  blueprint for modern corporations that did all that shit.

Only bit I disagree with is:

I don't think you've been doing it right.  Any system should be able to submit data, using a digital certificate can count as a signature, or login with a checkbox if old school.  

It doesn't have to be a replication of a form, just contain the system to pass the data.  Even if it's just a PDF you can form fill these, essentially as a mail merge.

2079,"Interesting passage:

&gt;Biden’s reasons for de-prioritizing the European allies extend beyond geography. There is considerable skepticism in Washington that a divided, self-interested Europe will ever manage much support for U.S. efforts against China. After decades of waiting for a more effective and geopolitically minded Europe to emerge, after the endless, frustrating efforts to get Europeans to spend even 2 percent of GDP on defense, and after watching yet another display during the pandemic of Europe’s chronic inability to get its act together, U.S. officials have largely concluded that Europe will never even be able to take care of itself, much less contribute to security in other regions. Many in Europe seem to agree.

&gt;As a result, Europe has mostly become a place to give speeches and conduct diplomacy in scenic locations. American officials will continue to show up and to intone the ritual incantations of transatlantic solidarity. They will continue to push Europeans to spend more on defense and support U.S. efforts to “manage China’s rise.”

&gt;But U.S. policymakers no longer believe in Europe’s capacity to contribute much beyond maintaining transatlantic economic ties (which remain quite important). Europeans’ aversion to defense spending means they will not be important geopolitical actors in East Asia; their addiction to the Chinese market means they will never be full-throated supporters of America’s campaign of geo-economic pressure on China; and, as Brexit recently demonstrated so vividly, their chronic internal divisions mean they would never be effective at those efforts even if they wanted to be.",,/r/europe/comments/ns8wiy/opinion_biden_talks_a_big_game_on_europe_but_his/h0kzhjf/,GrouponBouffon,1622823437

My argument would in fact be that non-whites would be the correct word for a similar reason you just mentioned, you just confused it I think and flipped the reasoning around. It is *non-whites* that does *not* imply that white is the standard, whereas it is the term 'people of colour / mensen van kleur' that implies white people are the standard.   


Indeed, this is because the term 'people of colour' does not mean anything in and of itself. The only reason you would use this term, is in relation to white people, specifically to mean non-white. People of colour are not a category, and cannot be a 'standard'. Africans and Chinese people for example have absolutely nothing in common. There is nothing that warrants them being in a category together. Chinese people in China will not identify with the same group as Africans. The entire term people of colour relies on the dichotomy of white vs. non-white, which is nonsensical way to analyze the world that only makes sense from a white perspective. Therefore, it is better to use the term non-white, if the only thing you wish to point out is the fact that they are non-white. Generally, you should avoid categories which only specification is that it is *not* something.   


It's like dividing the world between 'Europe' and 'the rest', and then just give 'the rest' a fancy term. I think this is a great example where progressive thought is inherently racist in and of itself and either harms relations between races or inflicts harm to your own.",Gelderland (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/nptvv9/holland_vs_the_netherlands/h0khygc/,IkBenTrotsDusBlij,1622815795

2244,"&gt; Did those countries not have an obligation to defend themselves? As far as I can tell they didn't even bother to try, often surendering within hours. Their fate was caused by their own lack of will, their choice not to build defences.

Czechoslovakia and Poland built fortifications against the Germans and fielded well-trained armies. It's not Czechoslovakia's fault that Britain and France sided with Hitler and helped him annex their country, and it's not Poland's fault that France and Britain turned their back on Poland regardless of the fact that they were treaty-bound to do so, and especially considering the fact that the entire western line was exposed to the point where the French could ride straight to Berlin without any resistance.

So no, you can't blame Czechoslovakia for being partitioned by one of the greatest powers in the world that was backed by two other great powers, and you can't blame Poland for having to fight a war on two fronts that was exacerbated by Franco-British cowardice and incompetence.

&gt;Modern Europe is much the same. Sitting on their arses, cutting defence, deciding that they don't need to bother, they'll just carpetbag off someone else's effort. Then when they get invaded they complain, ""This is a disgrace, people should have helped us while we were sitting on our arses doing nothing and hoarding our money"".

2305,"Look, a quick search of Climate of India has given me these results (quote from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_India), there are footnotes): 

&gt;The India Meteorological Department (IMD) designates four climatological seasons:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Winter**, occurring from December to February. The year's coldest   
months are December and January, when temperatures average around   
10–15 °C (50–59 °F) in the northwest; temperatures rise as one proceeds   
towards the equator, peaking around 20–25 °C (68–77 °F) in mainland   
India's southeast.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Summer** or **pre-monsoon** season, lasting from March to May.   
In western and southern regions, the hottest month is April and the   
beginning of May and for northern regions of India, May is the hottest   
Month. In May, Temperatures average around 32–40 °C (90–104 °F) in most   
of the interior.  
&gt;  
&gt;&lt;...&gt;

So either you live in hot areas during the Indian (or should I say, Hindu, I'm sorry for my ignorance on this) summer, monsoon and post-monsoon and then travel up to the mountains at high latitudes to experience -15'c regularly in winter, or you're lying when you say that you regularly experience both, or my sources are completely off. There's a lot of interesting information on that Wikipedia page regarding climate of India.

All I'm saying is that for a person, who lives in a particular area, his/her threshold for feeling a hot or cold weather depends on the climate the person is used to. I'm not talking about the continent as a whole. And then you brought in your question, which is sort of rude because you didn't bother to take into account that bodies acclimate to a particular climate and altitudes that's why the entire summer of 40'c - 45'c temperatures in Finland (and Northern Europe) would be an absolute hell and torture beyond imagination because our whole ecosystems would face catastrophic consequences. Paraphrasing your question, you could equally say this and convey the same emotion: ""*That's nothing, look how unfortunate we are*"".

2331,"\&gt; Yes. The common denominator is that their struggle with life is reflected in their appearance. Other people see this and (usually unconsciously) act differently because of that.

So you thinkg you can see if soemone is gay, lesbian or trans for example?

\&gt; Excluding people imo is physical harassment. 

Yeah, your opinion just doesn't matter. The law does and it does not agree with you. 

\&gt; And psychological harassment isn’t good, but everyone should develop a sort of shield for that. How do you think dwarfs feel? They hear a shitton of bad jokes since childhood and some even commit suicide because of this constant barrage of bullshit. I definitely do not support this harassment, but no one can control what other people say. By merely trying that, you become the oppressor yourself. So if you want to enjoy life, to a certain degree you should stop giving a fuck to what other people say. This holds true for literally everyone.

Ah, so nice you make the victim to the perpetrator.

But hey, driving people to suicide is apparently less bad than giving someone a few bruises in your world. Nice.

\&gt; You don’t have to make assumptions about my personality. I have gay friends, I have a genderdysmorphic brother, and I don’t think anyone of them is any more special than any other person on this planet (objectively speaking). But by not joining your fight and voicing a different opinion alone, you found validation of your fight.

I didn't need to make assumptions. What I wrote follows straight from what you wrote.

And, yeah, just because you have ""gay friends"" and genderdysmoprphic brother doesn'T mean you can't have a toxic mind set.

Btw. I'm a white hetero cis-male in my late 30s. That surely is not my fight. I just don't like toxic behaviour.

\&gt; You know what would really, on a deep level, cement lgbt acceptance in Western countries? Gratitude. For the first time in the history of this planet you are allowed to live the life you want, including getting extremely complex surgeries that really are a marvel of our time. I’m genuinely happy for you guys/girls. It would warm my heart if I saw militant lgbt people expressing gratitude and really feel like a step in the right direction.

Oh, wow, people should be grateful for being less oppressed in the past instead of striving for actual equality.

Yeah, I hope they are not and continue to push for them being as accepted in society as your average white hetero cis male.

Syria also bordered areas that have been a power vacuum since the invasion of Iraq, and the civil war is also influenced by regional conflicts, such as between Iran, Saudi Arabia and Isreal, with outside interference from both Russia, the US and Europe. 

Syria is a broken country, and people have fled the country because of that devastation, which of course brings further economic havoc. But Syria in 2014 was not in a situation that is comparable to Belarus today, and no authoritarian leader is envious of Assad.

If it does happen it will probably start in some place barely populated as a deterrence method, probably perhaps even nuking just inside your own borders to vaporize incoming columns.

But I'm not talking about receiving a trickle of Belarusians that make it across, I'm suggesting that Europe makes an effort to a) communicate to all Belarusians that they are offered asylum in Europe and b) actively help people across the border, despite Lukashenko clamping down on people trying to leave. The aim being to create a mass exodus that cripples the regime. I believe their population is close to 10 million, and as such the first mile stone should be helping at least 1 million across within e.g. a few months, but essentially being prepared to receive everyone who aren't directly involved with the regime. At the very least, there'll be an initial cost in sorting out accommodation and basic necessities for these refugees until they are able to integrate. There will be children that have to be enrolled in schools, old people in need of care, people with disabilities etc. And unless they are all accepted in their neighbouring countries, where the language is closer to their Russian, they will need more time to learn the language and integrate. So hosting them will involve initial costs for the receiving country. 

I think it is well within our capabilities to do this, and like you I think most Belarusians would do well.

Germany was to be delivered close to 100 million of the 200 million BioNTech-Pfizer doses the EU ordered (in September 2020).

That was the case because most EU countries didn't even want to order the vaccine due to the costs.

But once it turned out that the BioNtech-Pfizer vaccine was the only one to be delivered in large enough quantities, Germany gave away the first priority rights to those doses to other countries.

2734,"&gt;Actually I’m in the UK military and I attend presentations on this all the time, so eff-off.

Making personal statement on the Internet is useless, you might as well be an nigerian prince but whatever.

&gt;and are not set up to work together very well.

There are many multinational excersises, and I also think that once shit hits the fan they will have to make do.

&gt;It would take weeks to get (say) tanks from Spain to the Russian border because no-one in Europe has heavy airlift capacity 

It would also take time for russia to mobilize and many signs would point to war even earlier. 

&gt;- including satellite surveillance, heavy lifting and large numbers of rapid-response forces (eg the USMC). 

I am not denying that the US has better capabilies than europe, but again, the EU has its own space agency and also units like the foreigners legion or sas. Although the SAS is british and not part of EU, I dont think they would just sit by as the baltics get invaded.

&gt;To operate as an integrated army without the US, EU military spending would need to rise by at least another percent of GDP,

I am also not denying that the low spending (in germany especially) is due to the reliance on NATO, and hence the US. But thats just pragmatism, as much as nato fades, the more will politicians realize that they need better defence.

&gt;and would need to develop a lot of technology they dont have.

I would disagree with that, france and germany are pretty big arms dealer. The technology certainly exists, be it Rheinmetall, MBDA or Airbus defence.

&gt;Politically, each country would need to be willing to turn over control of their military to a central EU command. That would be a huge step towards a united europe 

Frontex has shown that its not impossible when also on a much smaller quantity. But if it would work or not i dont know although it is likely. In the case if an russian Invasion though, I doubt the EU countried would care about that too much. Especially eastern europe.

&gt;and a similar logic (historically russian, with a Russian speaking population) would apply to the eastern parts of many countries bordering Russia.

Again, invading a small Island that 40 years ago was your own is quite a bit different from attacking an important economic Partner with a many times stronger economy and population. You may say that those two dont matter but I would disagree. And also, poland hungary and so on arent historically russian. At most eastern bloc, but the most they have in common is being slavic.

Leaving aside that a russian Invasion is highly unlikely, the technology, economy and manpower certainly exists. Also, the EU isnt the most united of Union but thats mostly due to the eastern parts of it, who would also be the most pressured by an russian offensive. 

I am not even denying that the EU militaries arent as effective as they could be, but the main reason at the moment is that they dont have to. NATO (and thus largely the US) is keeping the peace as are the economic ties between russia and the EU. The reason I am not thankful towards the US is because first of all they arent doing it out of the kindness of their hearts, and secondly because I could actually imagine just ignoring their treaty obligations once russia attacks. As anti-nato the US seems to be it wouldnt make much of a difference after all.",Bavaria (Germany),/r/europe/comments/nrl6ph/two_european_aircraft_carriers_fs_charles_de/h0ipkme/,Unoriginell,1622773988

2885,"&gt; Its not like the moment the US leaves nato russia is going to attack.

Russia is actively undermining NATO, with its stooges in the EU, for what reason then?

Also tell that to the countries in eastern Europe who in the last 10 years have been side-stepping the EU and NATO and using bilateral military cooperation with the US for the express purpose of deterring Russian aggression. How many eastern European countries have invited the US to station troops in their territory? Many. The reason the US has to do this and not say... Germany, or France, is specifically because it's the US that can be counted on, and actually has the political will and military prowess to make a difference.

By the way, remember Ukraine? Not a NATO member. Russia invaded and annexed territory from Ukraine. This was just recently, and you're actually pretending that Russia isn't an openly hostile, aggressive, power-hungry country that will invade and exploit any country it can if it can get away with it.

&gt;In 2019, China’s statistics bureau defined rural poverty as below per capita annual income of 2,300 yuan ($356).

Many actually need cloud - with amount of data that company produce it is best possible storage for non-essencial backups, shared data (try to do inside hosted fileshare for international company and see why they use MS, Google or in some really extreme cases IBM).  
Small and most medium companies - not so much. But if there is infrastructure build for huge one it is cheaper to work with experienced company which deliver such storage (cloud services etc. - Ima talking mostly about storages cause this is my field). And I saw 'storage solutions' created inhouse for small companies (we dont need specialised tools, we dont need good and reliable backups etc.) and those are... well... not always exactly reliable.  


Ergo - cloud is good. BUT not for everything (I fucken hate some managers 'everything to cloud' approach). For mid (or even small but not tiny ones) companies mixed approach (small inhouse storage for critical data, cloud for noncritical and, if you can, buy additional backup services - it is a must with current state of cybersecurity and general lack of understanding of data importance...). Big companies use this approach already (either with data centers or data rooms).  
And about combustion - it is second DC that I've seen down (working since 2015 with them). Previous one was in US during flooding (2018).

3019,"1- The government demands tests (PCR or Antigen, from designated labs only), it doesn't demand travel, which you are free to choose (train, bus, foot, car, plane...)
2- Airlines are critical for EU freedom of movement values
3- Airlines suffered a lot
4- Covid testing is a brand new, short lived and highly profitable industry

With how the governments have been advertising the ""war on covid"" to support their state-of-emergency power grabs, I could kind of see testing labs working for free as a sort of ""war time"" requisitioning... But I don't think the situation is that serious to justify such unfairness to testing labs.

Serious enough for state-of-emergency, but not serious enough to requisition labs eh? :) 

Seriously though, I have a slight preference for government and EU subsidy because all of EU is under threat and governments have a responsibility for civil safety. I don't think labs should bear a large portion of the weight of this.

I find the Czech/Austrian measures quite reasonable and I'm frustrated there hasn't been more EU coordination to incentivize other countries to adopt similar, uniform measures. You can read my other post about the Czech/Austrian measures higher in the thread for more context.


As I mentioned, if you have a comfortable life with the luxury of choice, whether vaccinating or traveling and you choose not to, that's wonderful, more power to you buddy, but not everyone has that luxury.

I can think of a few reasonable and pretty common scenarios where traveling is a necessity: you find a new job mid-pandemic, you have close family abroad, your home country calls you for vaccination and your new working country didn't call you yet or isn't going to, you have personal belongings you need to take when moving to a new home abroad, and many more.

Ironically, it's more likely for these needs to happen to people who have been living ""more European"" lives, enabled by decades of free movement.

""Enough is enough. #mittaontäysi  
EDIT: Turns out that further explanation is needed, especially for those who are not in the Finnish bubble 😉 Cultural &amp; event professionals of all realms gathered today to Finnish Parliament to a demonstration titled ""enough is enough"". It was about many things. Corona, obviously, has walked all over us, and to top it off our left-leaning government couple weeks back announced huge cuts to funding for the arts in the coming couple of years.  
Our declaration with four statements on how to move forward was received by the culture minister and then politicians from different parties opened their mouths and made sounds like ""we have heard you"". So we'll see what comes next then.  
The whole ordeal was organized by a stellar team of arts professionals, and boy it was organized well. The idea was for everyone to stand still, dressed in black and with 2 m safety distance to each other, and stare our Parliament House down. It worked magically well. After the speeches were held, everything became quiet and people just stood their ground. Everyone had agreed to stay until 2pm – I think the program was done around half past one.  
Then someone in the back started clapping.  
And then we clapped for good 20 minutes - half an hour. For me personally it was a standing ovation to the farce that has been in play in the house we were facing and somewhat cathartic. What happens next remains to be seen, but today was a good day.""",Finland/Turkey,/r/europe/comments/nratha/finns_riot_at_the_parliament_requiring_reopening/h0hchxw/,darknum,1622751147

Well at the time of that article's publishing, police had only said that there was a personal motive between the brothers and their friend. 

Later it turned out (according to the accused) that their mother had told them she had been raped by the man. 

But no police must have been racist to not see how racist the attack was. 

&gt;In Denmark, the government has compiled a “ghetto list” of neighborhoods for a decade; new proposals of dealing with the neighborhoods have been identified  by United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights as “hugely troubling and risks heightening racial discrimination against people of migrant origin – further ‘ghettoising’ them.

Tell me, how is it racist to try to integrate people from closed communities into the rest of Denmark instead of living segregated? 

https://harvardpolitics.com/nordic-racism/

&gt;The poll – which monitored the situation in fellow Scandinavian countries Sweden, Finland and Norway, as well as the UK, Germany and France

It's a poll... who the fuck cares. 

&gt;The report said that Denmark gave the impression of being overall very intolerant, but pointed out that when not considering the Roma/Gypsies/travellers category, it was actually third behind Finland and France respectively. In more positive news for the country, just seven per cent of people were intolerant of gays – the least percentage of all seven countries.

It seems like it was close. 

None of it says though what you claimed. 

https://www.icenews.is/2015/06/26/denmark-is-most-intolerant-country-in-northern-europe/

&gt;Your brain denies your thinking. Since when are Harvard Politics, LA times, Pew Research and IceNews are left-learning publication?

&gt;Jette Moeller, head of the Danish chapter of SOS-Racism, an international association.

As I said, US media always interview very biased sources makes them make the narrative of what's going on. 

&gt; The Danish police, prosecutor, a defense lawyer and a white friend of the victim all say a personal relationship that went wrong between the victim and the perpetrators was the reason for the slaying, not racism.

Same as above. The story was written before the other motive was publicly known. 

&gt;In 2016, Denmark made international headlines when a law was passed requiring asylum seekers to hand over valuables worth more than $1,500 to help cover housing and food costs while their cases were being processed.

Ah yes how cruel. People paying for their own stay despite never being able to cover it.

Scandinavia/Skandinavia means what you said in Nordic languages. However English is a different language and the meaning of ""Scandinavia"" in English is not defined by Nordic languages, but by what it is used to mean in English. This is how words are defined in languages.

In English and some other languages, the use of ""Scandinavia"" is rather old, having been in use already when Finland was part of Sweden. In old French dictionaries Scandinavia is also defined specifically including Finland (as part of Sweden). In Nordic countries when nationalism and scandinavism was in, the meaning shifted to modern Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

In English language, Scandinavia is more ambiguous term, and it's not strictly incorrect in English to say Finland is part of Scandinavia (even though it irks us Nordic people). For example the Scandinavia House by Scandinavia-America foundation represents [all Nordic countries](http://www.scandinaviahouse.org/about/). ""[Scandinavian design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_design)"" is unquestionably a term for design from all Nordic countries. Also Wikipedia has had a hot debate about it, and [the article acknowledges the more ambiguous meaning in Englisn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia#Use_of_Nordic_countries_vs._Scandinavia).",Finland,/r/europe/comments/nratha/finns_riot_at_the_parliament_requiring_reopening/h0gv21p/,Toby_Forrester,1622743787

Do you think it's possible that a lot of people in EU, especially younger ones, are having cross-EU relationships and family? How would you feel to be kept away from your family if you were in similar circumstances?

You really must have a comfortable life if you assume 1, and that's great for you, but it's not like that everywhere. 2 and 3 are impossible to know unless you know someone personally. Unsubstantiated assumptions like those do not help your arguments, it weakens them.

Because that is the cost of operating in the EU according to the values of the EU. Those are the values that make it one of the best places on earth to live in.

What makes any of those any different than the value of freedom of movement within the EU?

The industry was also demanding that the state invest at least one percent of its budget on culture and bolster the status and safety net of freelancers in the cultural sector.

&gt; Those leading the demonstration included many established, successful artists including musicians, writers, directors, dancers and actors, as well as leaders of industry groups. They handed over a statement including the above demands to government ministers and MPs.

Simplified Summary: The Banks started doing that in 2011 (or possibly earlier), but they found a couple of lawyers who told them that what they are doing is absolutely fine.

2013 an opposition party made an official inquiry to the Government and they had to clarify that it is illegal, but no much else happened. The Finanzamt (""German IRS"") still ignored it.

Magazine Spiegel in 2014 published a list of names of people benefiting from cum-ex transactions.

Public broadcast network WDR in 2016 made a report about cum-ex and the billions in taxes that are evaded this way.

In 2017 the public broadcast networks NDR, WDR and a newspaper got more information from Insiders.

In 2017 it also seems that the first police investigation got some work done.

Also in 2017 the BaFin (government agency in charge of money and banks) send questionnaires to banks because they feared that especially smaller banks may go bankrupt if they suddenly had to pay back those evaded taxes.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/nqot82/german_banker_first_to_be_jailed_in_cumex_tax/h0fw0o2/,MistakeNot___,1622729254

Also, let's be real, whatever service a member of any royal family of any country might've done in reasonably recent times was mostly done for PR reasons or to set an example.

I just find it extremely hard to understand how you can be okay with the idea of wasting taxpayer money on a family for symbolic or historical reasons.

3393,"&gt;The US has threatened to slap tariffs on $2bn worth of goods from the UK and five other countries as they argue about how to tax technology companies, a move that risks reigniting transatlantic trade wars unless parties resolve thorny talks over a broader international tax agreement.  
&gt;  
&gt;The office of the US trade representative said it was imposing but immediately suspending for six months the tariffs on Austria, India, Italy, Spain, Turkey and the UK as it wrapped up a series of investigations over the way the countries tax US tech giants.  
&gt;  
&gt;The announcement comes as wealthy countries are locked in intense negotiations to hammer out an update to the international tax regime. The Biden administration has proposed giving advanced economies powers to raise corporate tax from US tech companies and other large multinationals, while instituting a global minimum corporate tax.  
&gt;  
&gt;The advanced economies of the G7 are close to reaching agreement after progress in recent weeks, with finance ministers due to meet in London to discuss a possible deal on Friday. A G7 pact would be a stepping stone towards a deal in the formal negotiations taking place at the OECD in Paris and directed by the wider G20 countries.  
&gt;  
&gt;Governments introducing “digital services” levies have argued that tech companies pay too little tax on the profits they make in many countries, partly because they record them in low-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland. Washington has said the taxes are unfair because they disproportionately affect US companies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Katherine Tai, the US trade representative, said the six-month suspension of the tariffs would allow more time for international tax talks to continue, but it would allow Washington to maintain “the option of imposing tariffs . . . if warranted in the future”.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Biden administration in April offered a fresh proposal to overhaul the international tax system in an attempt to break the impasse in the tax talks being held at the OECD.  
&gt;  
&gt;The US proposal would apply taxes to the global profits of the very largest companies, including big US technology groups, regardless of their physical presence in a given country. It also sought a minimum global corporate tax rate of 21 per cent, although the US has recently said it would accept a 15 per cent minimum.  
&gt;  
&gt;A Spanish budget ministry official emphasised common ground with Washington rather than the threat of tariffs. Madrid has been saying for months that it wants and is working towards an international agreement on digital tax by the summer.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The fact that the US has suspended the tariff increase reflects its willingness to agree a deal on international taxation,” the ministry official said. “We celebrate the fact that the Biden administration is committed to tax co-operation and that it has aligned itself with positions that the Spanish government has been defending for years, such as establishing a minimum rate in corporate tax.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The UK would be worst-hit by the new tariffs if an agreement to dissolve them is not reached, with British exports to the US worth $887m a year saddled with levies of 25 per cent. The goods to be targeted include perfumes, make-up, clothes, jewellery and video games.  
&gt;  
&gt;The US has already suspended tariffs of 25 per cent on $1.3bn worth of French handbags and cosmetics, having at first threatened to hit champagne and cheeses with import tariffs of 100 per cent.",,/r/europe/comments/nrei0a/us_steps_up_tariff_threat_over_implementation_of/h0fwxkp/,SecondAccount404,1622729644

That technology existed already. What happened in the war was applying it to military needs. All the principles of radio, rocketry, cars, treacked vehicles, jet engines etc. were developed in peacetime already.

It was just not being used for the militaries and again the sole reason war seemingly developed them quickly (for military usage) is because countries bankrupted themselves and destroyed the very foundations of their economies so oftentimes they could not fund those things in the afterwar years.

That begs the question if those technologies would not have been developed more healthily in peace time.

I am arguing against mistaking military application with actual research and development.

3468,"&gt; Yes, I don't think deploying chemical weapons on opposition in the shape of Navalny is in line with expectations of a democratic election. And if that's not enough, then banning opposition from running on grounds of ""extremism"".

Not perfect but still democracy. The meaning of democracy is that the people decide. Well, they do. He simply uses shady tactics to make himself the only viable option in the eyes of the electorate. This is corrupt and shady, but it is still a democracy, as his power still relies on popular support.

&gt; But you base your claims of what people think on means of a single phone poll in a country where saying they don't want to be a part of Russia is llegal. 

Single phone call? There were multiple polls done by multiple companies from multiple countries over multiple years. They all generally show the same picture.

&gt; So then obvious solution to this is having an actual democratic election with actual democratic debate - unlike censorship of Ukrainian broadcasting that is ongoing in Crimea. And until that happens, it's plain illegitimate claim. Unless you want to condone the principle of armed men barging anyplace and claiming it's theirs on basis of falsified or at best unverifiable referendums.

I don't talk about the political state of Crimea itself. I'm talking about what Crimeans, the people who live there and what they think. You can still claim that it was illegal and stuff, but it won't change what the people at the ground think.

&gt; Moreover, if ""Do you want to be a part of Russia or Ukraine?"" is not even the quesstion, then the phone poll can't even be used as a proof of it.

3529,"&gt;Five teenagers have been arrested in Belgium over the alleged gang rape of a 14-year-old girl who took her own life days after the attack.

&gt;The victim had intended to meet a friend in the Westerbegraafplaats cemetery in the city of Ghent on 14 May.

&gt;But four other youths joined and allegedly raped her while taking photos and videos of the scene.

&gt;The images were shared online and posted on social media by the alleged perpetrators, local media reported.

&gt;Speaking to Het Nieuwsblad newspaper, the victim’s father said he believed the images were “the straw that broke the camel’s back” and prompted his daughter to take her own life.

&gt;“Her entire world collapsed,” he said.

&gt;Police made five arrests after identifying the male suspects from the images: two aged 18 and 19, and three aged who are minors.

&gt;They are due to appear in court on Wednesday.

&gt;Ghent prosecutors confirmed the arrest of two adults and three minors for “events that happened a short time before the death of the victim”.

&gt;But they declined to comment on reports that an investigation has been opened for rape, indecent assault and the recording and publication of harmful images.

&gt;The major of the family’s hometown, Gavere, said he knew the victim and was shocked at the case.

&gt;“You don’t think something like this could happen in your municipality,” he said in an interview with Belgian website Het Laatste Nieuws.

&gt;The case has provoked a strong reaction from Belgian politicians, who have vowed to take action to prevent images of sexual assault being share online.

&gt;Sarah Schlitz, Belgian secretary of state for equality, said: “The distribution of such images on social media is not just intolerable, but also totally illegal. It should simply not be possible.”",vi veri universum vivus vici,/r/europe/comments/nr9ult/five_belgian_teenagers_arrested_over_gang_rape_of/h0f773l/,FebrisAmatoria,1622714842

3573,"I’m aware of it, (and it is far from a settled question). Thing is, if you understand the dynamics at play when monarchies were toppled, going into modernity, it is clear that although war is much less frequent, the reasons for it could a lot of things. But even if it is 100% correct and democracy leads to less war, I’d argue that it also leads to bigger and worse wars. I’m not only proving this by pointing at ww2 like some brainlet. We simply don’t have the data set to prove any of these points because there hasn’t been enough time. But it makes sense. 

Wars in the past that were between kings and lords. We’re essentially private affairs. And we can see the difference between antiquity and the Middle Ages in the scale and severity of war, along with the change in government form. 

Since war was a private affair to settle disputes between different lords and individuals, it involved way, way smaller armies, didn’t manifest itself as huge civilisational wars resulting in total civilian mobilisation, etc. 

As we had the enlightenment, and the concept of a state and nation shifted from the private domain of a king to the shared ownership of all the people, suddenly, wars changes accordingly to fit that description. Now when a state went to war, it wasn’t a king or lord who was responsible for all of this, to supply it, finance it, etc. It was the responsibility of the entire nation and its peoples. Suddenly millions of people were much more accepting of being pulled into wars which caused untold mayhem and destruction. 

We see this in the napoleonic wars, the First World War, the second, Korea, Vietnam, balkans, etc.





Now let’s go to today, wars are waaaay less frequent, but if a significant war was to happen, everyone is pretty much in agreement that it would plunge humanity into untold misery. Europe and Russia, China and America/Japan/Taiwan/Korea.

Indeed.

* Countries racked up tons of debt to pay for shutting down the economy, guess who's going to be paying that off.
* Having a period of time out of work has a compounding effect the younger you are when it happens, once again fucking young people.
* Migrants disproportionately compete with young people for jobs and housing.
* Environmental regulations disproportionately target young people (i.e. older people could pollute to their heart's content to make a quick buck)
* The cost of wars in the Middle East falls on young people again to pay - both in lives and economically.
* Elderly politicians are enriching themselves and their corporate cronies, at the expense of young taxpayers.

Tbf, according to the Finnish constitution, the parliament does have a lot to say on the matter. After new premature elections have been announced, the parliament gets to decide by themselves when they exactly want to suspend their work before the new elections.

It would be interesting to see what would happen if something like this came up after the date of suspension of parliamentary work and before the premature elections. Could the president make this kind of decision since they also have a say in foreign policy? Probably not, since this seems like an executive decision, and the president leads foreign policy together with the government, which would not have the mandate to make this kind of decisions.

You would be surprised how many university age students advocate for Soviet style policies (although I have met them from Canada and Western Europe as well). I actually have one friend from St. Petersburg that does, but he's a very special case. 

My former roommate was a huge China, Russia, Venezuela fan (especially Venezuela). He thought the state should subsidize housing, and continually confused me for the state by not paying rent. 

He would argue until he was blue in the face that Venezuela actually cared about it's populace and it's policies bettered their lives in the short and long term. 

I asked him how nationalizing supply chains all the way down to local stores would help people given the new price fixing regime would cause shortages. He assured me it wouldn't. I asked him about how nationalizing foreign oil production in the country, that was extremely heavily taxed, and replacing it with very inefficient extraction would help people. Especially because these taxes were paid in hard currency, namely dollars. He claimed the ""oil belonged to the people"" and it should be nationalized, even if it meant much less money in the government coffers (although, he couldn't really wrap his head around how this worked). Finally I asked him with their then current spending, how the Bolivar could weather a collapse in oil prices from the then current prices of well over $100/bbl. He ""didn't understand all the economics behind it"" but was convinced I was painting a gloomy picture because I wanted ""socialism to fail"". 

He assured me they would prosper in the long run, with one very important out. If they failed, it was the US' fault. 

Members of the Chicago Teachers Union took a trip to Venezuela where they visited communes, high ranking government officials, praised their policies, and criticized US sanctions against the country. Their multiple posts were retweeted by the official CTU twitter, including one calling them the CTU delegation.

4430,"&gt;It's just one more level of bureaucracy, and it makes the whole thing weaker, not stronger.

That is not really correct. In essence a lot of smaller European countries do not have defense forces that can even operate without NATO or a greater European ally. They may be capable of limited home defense, but cannot act independently beyond that.

E.g. Germany is currently integrating various neighboring forces into its command structures, plainly because those countries may have forces on the brigade level, but do not have anything to orchestrate operations with other neighbors.

I think Poland just a few years back joined its submarines into a binational headquarters with Germany's submarine command.

Those forces remain fully national, but actually try to gain integration on   
 an operational level they can only get on a European level (little different to how NATO creates joint forces).",,/r/europe/comments/nqix14/biden_urged_to_push_eu_to_be_a_military_power/h0bt0ri/,mangalore-x_x,1622650078

Well, that's not really true. Or depends what you mean with upgrading. The basic design of a gun hasn't really changed since 1900s but now we have computer controlled stabilization and targeting systems, programmable ammunition etc. So the firing procedure for essentially similar gun has gone from ""point the reticle to target with some estimated lead and pull the trigger"" to ""tell the computer who you want to kill and it does the work"". 

Russian military problem is that it's very strong on paper but the economy has trouble supporting that strength. For example, they have like 20000 main battle tanks. The problem is that something like 15000 of them are t-72s in long term (read: permanent) storage (yes yes, the numbers are not accurate, can't bother to actually check right now). Their post soviet programs to modernize tank force have produced some interesting technology but they have not been able to order more than a handful of the new vehicles. Same goes with aircraft. Interesting projects but orders beyond the first prototypes are on hold. And the navy too rusts faster than they can replace it.

While russian military has the advanced tech stuff, most of the strength on paper is still ""point to the target and pull the trigger"" type. The effective size of the military is going down.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/npnpg9/russia_throughout_the_ages/h0bcqr7/,jaaval,1622642983

4557,"I’ve studied fluid mechanics and I understand a bit about how such calculations are done.  

Scientists would flood successively larger models of Holland until they had collected data on Hollands ranging from 5% to 2000% of Holland’s size, and they’d draw a sigmoid graph of the relationship between the Holland Size Ratio (HSR) and the total rate of flow.  

They’d print these off as posters where they’d hang on the walls of messy rooms without air conditioning next to time clocks and hard hats.  

On the day Holland is flooding, they’d find where the curve passes HSR = 1 on the HSR-to-flood-precession-distance-factor (FPDF) graph hanging on the wall, to produce the hypothesized flood precession distance factor (FPDF^(h)).  

After the flood is complete, the actual flood precession distance factor (FPDF^(a)) would be measured empirically.  

Using that measurement, the flood precession distance factor error factor (FPDFEF, pronounced “fpdfef” for short) is calculated as FPDFEF = |FPDF^(a) - FPDF^(h)|  

Finally we can get the predicted flood precession distance factor:  

FPDF^(p) = FPDF^(h) + FPDFEF  

And that gives you the overall flood precession speed, where “speed” is represented as the “distance factor” multiplied by time squared over 8",,/r/europe/comments/nptvv9/holland_vs_the_netherlands/h0bd3j3/,intensely_human,1622643146

4747,"&gt;So a murderer in roman times wouldn't be a horrible person?

As I said, they are neither good or bad people, they are just people of their time. You keep trying to put your morality on them, its silly and kind of unfair tbh. In 2000 years, what do you think people will say about us?

&gt;Just because the word the western word uses was invented in 1943 that doesn't mean that genocide didn't exist beforehand, look at what they had done to Carthage or in Gallia.

Genocide is strictly used in the context of destroying a people, along the grounds of ethnic cleansing and what not. Was Carthage not a competitor themselves?

4749,"&gt; The current policy of Israel isn't better, so?

Of course it isn't, but desiring to swap the roles is not an improvement. The world isn't black and white, both the Israel state and Hamas can be wrong. They both desire eradication of the other side. 

The phrase shown does not mean freedom from occupation, it means eradication of Israel, and for a one state solution without Jews. The ""river to the sea"" means from the river Jordan to the Mediterranean, which is where Israel is located. It indicates that Palestine should cover that entire area. 

This is not a better state of being than the current one. Both Jews and Palestines deserve the right of self-determination, and their own self governance.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/nqfuye/dutch_university_removes_propalestinian_banners/h0apt6r/,deukhoofd,1622628703

It's one of the few reasons why fascist Italy was an authoritarian regime not a totalitarian one. Because no matter how powerful and pervasive the regime was there were also other power centres, like the king and to some extent the church. 

The reasons why the republic won are the following mostly:

- the king could have stopped the coup very easily and did not

- did nothing to remove M. from power until it was way too late 

- after the armistice the king and his family escaped south leaving northern Italians to face a German invasion force and a civil war.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/nq5w04/happy_italian_republic_day/h0apwaj/,albadellasera,1622628778

That of course goes against Russian and Serbian plans for the region and this is why we see Serbia being nervous about this.

What a shit take. 

This has nothing to do with supposed Westernization coming from Greece (a ridiculous idea in itself considering the rich Greek culture), but about formal ties between Greece and Kosovo, which can lead to the recognition of the province as a sovereign country, which of course Serbia wants to prevent.

Chartage literally did nothing, and was then invaded, razed to the ground, all their citizens killed or made into slaves, no exception, and then it got annexed.

4886,"It is a very similar issue to people saying 'England' to Scotland and Wales, in the sense that both (southern) England and Holland are the economic, demographic and political centers of their respective states. This is why it makes sense for other languages to have ingrained the use of 'England' and 'Holland' to denote the entire countries, because most of the people they came into contact with likely did come from Holland and England. 

However, to understand why the difference does matter to many people you have to understand the internal dynamics within these countries. Both in the Netherlands and Britain, Holland and (southeastern) England respectively have for centuries often neglected the peripheral regions' wishes or mostly used them for industry, agriculture or whatever else could make the center region more money. 
Meanwhile, the peripheral regions' voices have often been dismissed, talked over or not heard, whether they are Frisians, Groningers, Limburgers, Northern English, folks from rural Devon or East Anglia, Scots or Welshmen. The languages and ways of life of these people have for a long time been branded 'stupid' or 'backwards' by both Holland and England, and until recent decades efforts were even made to slowly erase these languages as if they were a bad and uncivilised habit. 

This is why a Scot doesn't appreciate being called English, but also why someone from Groningen doesn't want to be lumped in with the term 'Holland'. If Groningers experience dismissal of their region by Hollanders as some far away blip on the map, from which Holland does like to extract gas money while many Hollanders complain when they actually go there because ""OMG it's suuuuuch a long drive from Amsterdam"", when the people who live in the province are often romanticised as cute rural simpletons at best or dismissed as dumb farmers with a backwards language at worst, why should someone from Groningen identify with the term 'Holland'? The same sentiment is also strongly felt by many in Friesland, Limburg, Drenthe and Overijssel. Utrecht and Zeeland maybe less so.

On Marin's reign the default seems to be that everything is secret. Journalists have to work really hard to get documents that should be public anyways. I think on some occasions they have even needed to get a court order to get the documents.

Some of the hassle also seems like reputation management. Only documents favorable to Marin seem to be public by default and sometimes other documents are ""leaked"" on convenient occasions for Marin's benefit.

Of course this has made the journalists digging even deeper because it looks like the government is trying to hide something.

It is also funny that one of the values of Marin's cabinet was openness. Marin is also complaining every once in a while on the digging made by media and that it's only because she is a woman.

Flip side, though, would also mean that individual EU member states would have to drop things that they want but the whole does not.  Maybe the EU isn't willing to involve itself in Mali and France doesn't like that.  Maybe the EU doesn't want to get in a spat with the UK over Northern Ireland (we didn't, back in our early days, and [the US paid off Maine to basically drop its — probably legally correct — territorial dispute with Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aroostook_War)).

The Welsh have always considered themselves to be distinct from the English and have taken it for granted that Wales was a country in its own right and was never successfully absorbed into ‘England’ and ‘Englishness’, regardless of what the law stated.  In the years between Wales’ annexation into the Kingdom of England and the Act Of Union with Scotland, Wales was often referred to as the Dominion of Wales by the English elites, which, does show that even the English never considered Wales to be England ‘proper’.  While England always overshadowed everything on the political front, the Welsh continued to develop their own identity, national symbols and institutions regardless.  They already had their own language, but also built their own churches and had their own flag, Y Ddraig Goch for centuries, but it was only given Royal approval in 1959. Similarly, whereas Welsh people took it for granted that Cardiff was the capital of Wales for generations, it was only acknowledged as the capital by Westminster officialdom in 1955.  For a while in the late 19th century, God Bless The Prince Of Wales and Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau were both used as national anthems, but Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau eventually won out as a favourite when compared to the more sycophantic God Bless, which was taken to be more accepting of Wales’ subservience to the English crown.

5338,"&gt; Still trying to change the definition to match your view, uh. That's not how it works. Good luck to find a definition from a trusted source giving a minimal death requirement for a coup. This is just not a thing.

That's how it works. Go take a look at Turkey, Myanmar and Mali in past 5 years. Those countries have had coups successful (Mali, Myanmar)/unsuccessful (Turkey) and all coups have done by the military hahaha. It's ok escargot, you don't know much about military stuff since your country got 18 times smaller military than us.

We know, military isn't your thing lol

&gt; They weren't protesting, they were trying to actually overthrow, legally elected Democrats and a part of the Republicans. Hopefully for your country they were just a bunch of disorganized moron. And army involvement isn't a necessity, just on way to do a coup among other way.

- Pandemic numbers are still dropping. Daily new infections have been under 500 for 10 straight days, daily deaths are consistently under 50. On Sunday, the number of people in hospital dropped below 1,000 for the first time since 9 October, which is less than one-twelfth of the peak hospitalisations in late March (over 12,000). This week, the government confirmed that single-digit cases have been caused by the Indian-originated B.1.617 variant of the virus, and have cautioned for a possible spike in infections it might cause.

- As of Monday morning, 5.15M people have been given a Covid jab, including 3.61M who have received two doses. There are plenty of vaccines in stock, but the vaccination drive has slowed down, as those willing to get a jab have mostly already done so. Accordingly, the government [had to revise its plan](https://hungarytoday.hu/hungary-vaccinations-vaccine-purchases-slowing/) of 7 million people vaccinated by mid-May to 6 million total.

- On Friday, PM Viktor Orbán went to London to meet his British counterpart. The meeting didn't get anywhere near the media reaction in Hungary as it did in Britain, and it's not known if Orbán used an interpreter in his dealings with Mr Johnson or relied on his own English skills.

- Szilveszter Bus, the Hungarian ambassador to Thailand was [recalled and dismissed](https://index.hu/belfold/2021/05/29/bus-szilveszter-ertesulesek/) in late April, and now it's emerged that his frequent participation in (presumably homosexual) orgies was the reason for his removal, and information on the ambassador was gathered by Thai authorities and diplomatic intelligence officers. It's the second time in just over two years that an ambassador's career ended in a sex scandal after now-convicted paedophile Gábor Kaleta was secretly brought home from Peru in April 2019, though this one is more similar to the [Szájer case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3zsef_Sz%C3%A1jer#Resignation), as yet another Hungarian dignitary got into moral rather than legal trouble abroad.

- A week ago it emerged that Katalin Karikó, Senior Vice President of BioNTech and a key person in the development of its mRNA Covid vaccine, [was signed up as an informant](https://www.euronews.com/2021/05/24/covid-19-vaccine-scientist-katalin-kariko-was-listed-as-communist-era-police-informant) for the communist-era secret police in 1978. Karikó acknowledged that she had been recruited, but claimed that she was compelled to sign up in order to be able to pursue a scientific career (as her father had fought in the 1956 revolution), and that she had not submitted any written reports. No reports written by her were found in the archives, and she was 'inactivated' after she left the country in 1985, which implies that she was not deployed by secret police to the West as a spy.

- Wednesday marked the 15th anniversary of the ['Őszöd speech'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%90sz%C3%B6d_speech) delivered by then-PM Ferenc Gyurcsány to a meeting of Socialist MPs. In the speech Gyurcsány admitted to 'lying throughout the last year and a half or two' before that spring's elections (which he won) and criticised his own government for inactivity and fiscal irresponsibility, often using vulgar language. A recording of the speech leaked in September that year, [leading to massive protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_protests_in_Hungary), permanently damaging the government's reputation and largely contributing to Fidesz's overwhelming victory in 2010. Fidesz and the government [have been talking at great length about the anniversary](https://insighthungary.444.hu/2021/05/27/hungary-joins-european-union-in-condemning-belarus-for-forced-grounding-of-airliner) and Gyurcsány's administration, and even a film is currently being made about the speech and its aftermath. The speech has some relevance as Gyurcsány is still a prominent opposition politician leading a party with a support of 10-15 percent, so expect ""Gyurcsány"" to remain a hot campaign topic in the run up to the 2022 elections.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/no5isy/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20210530/h07wp7n/,dickblaha,1622570721

5638,"&gt;Residents of a picturesque Russian village have seen the price of their land double as people from Moscow and other cities snap up properties as a refuge from COVID-19 where they can work remotely.  
&gt;  
&gt;Krasnaya Polyana (Red Meadow) is a beautiful village of five streets in the mountains near the Black Sea. Flanked by mountains, it has good quality tap water, fresh air and big blue skies - things that can prove elusive in Moscow.  
&gt;  
&gt;The village has 5,000 residents, which is typical for Russia. What is atypical is that there are 20 cafes, restaurants, a pub and a bar, along with fast Wifi.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some of the restaurants existed before the pandemic to cater for skiers who use nearby resorts built for the 2014 Winter Olympics. But the locals decided to open year-round once they got over fears that visitors from Moscow would bring COVID-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;Demand for second homes has fuelled a housing boom.  
&gt;  
&gt;Russian land prices are assessed in 100 square metre units, or sotki. The price of one sotka in Krasnaya Polyana has risen to 5 million roubles ($68,000) from 2 million before the pandemic, Nikolai Rogachev, a local sales agent, told Reuters.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is likely to hit 7 million by the end of 2021, he said, due to strong demand when overseas travel options are limited.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We call it the zombie apocalypse,"" another real estate agent said, referring to demand from city dwellers for any kind of property in the village and the quality of their social skills after months spent in their small urban flats.  
&gt;  
&gt;Prices for cottages in the village vary from 40 million to 900 million roubles, according to the CIAN real estate database.  
&gt;  
&gt;Demand comes mainly from wealthy businessmen from big cities as prices are beyond ordinary Russians.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rents have also risen, driven by demand from people who work remotely and see Krasnaya Polyana as an escape from the city. The airport is a 40-minute drive and hiking trails start directly from the village.  
&gt;  
&gt;""I enjoy hiking the mountain trails and being able to find pleasant company in local places in the evenings,"" said Kirill Ryzhonkov, a data analyst from Moscow.  
&gt;  
&gt;A co-working space opened in October, primarily for IT and start-up specialists.  
&gt;  
&gt;Its owners expect Krasnaya Polyana to become a Russian Silicon Valley regardless of how the pandemic develops.  
&gt;  
&gt;""People have already noticed the advantages: the same time zone as Moscow, a 2-hour flight to Moscow, skiing in the winter, the sea in summer and cool infrastructure left behind by the Olympics,"" said Ilya Kreimer, manager of the co-working space.

They had more manpower before it as well.

&gt;	'Enemy at the Gates' with the whole sharing rifles thing comes to mind.

Fair, enemy at the gates is not a good movie, but the charge scene seems par for the course in bad Hollywood depictions of combat. It over sensationalizes being ordered to “charge” without a rifle… and then their depiction of mowing down retreating soldiers is false.

That said…

There absolutely were Soviet units in desperate supply situations. As there were German… and British… and American… and Japanese units at various places and points in time. Soviet blocking attachments did exist.

Why are you pushing a narrative of the Soviet front not being hard fought? This is extremely weird.

&gt;	In most popular Western depictions of the Eastern Front

Honestly I’ve never seen one, most westerners idea of WW2 in Europe stems entirely from the fall and liberation of France. The eastern front is most likely to not exist in their minds much at all. It’s not a popular notion of trench warfare… the number of people with this specific misconception has to be vanishingly small.

They probably far more often assume British, French, and American casualties approached those of the Soviets.",,/r/europe/comments/npnpg9/russia_throughout_the_ages/h07gwwu/,Easy_Humor_7949,1622563882

5696,"We, therefore also Finland, have been hearing about Italy's banks ticking problem. Something has been done after pressure from your governments that did not work. Namely austerity. 

You cannot pretend to be the doctor, give a treatment to the patient that makes them worse and then accuse the patient for the outcome, while you are also getting paid for that treatment.

Northern Europe has a reason to participate in it. The reason is that given the free market conditions that would otherwise exist, they wouldn't be in the position to compete with China or other Asian countries.

EU is protectionism at the expense of jobs and tax revenue in southern Europe. How on earth would industry concentrate itself on the North. The taxes are huge, workers are heavily unionized and demand good wages and welfare. The south gets free credits to buy your produce, and you get the sweet taste of the multiplier effects.

The stark difference in political cultures is that the north does not wish for a fiscal and political union. They don't want a fiscal one because they are currently the rich ones, and don't want a political one because they are keen on the neoliberal doctrine regardless of government. They only want artificial markets for their exports, free movement of people to be able to have holidays with ease, and a common currency to help with this process of plundering production out of the South.

So,I don't have a job in my country and I had to leave while my parents worked for many years with great contributions in order to get peanuts in pension some time in the future. 

And that is because Gudrun and Arttu wanted to keep having well paid jobs, keep enjoying welfare and good pensions, while in a true open economy they would never be able to have it like this.

5728,"You seem confused - lab leak and lab creation aren't contradictory. Scientists create viruses in labs ALL THE TIME. In fact, it's known that happens in the Wuhan lab. 

""Lab creation"" doesn't mean that ""China would intentionally infect their own population"" - it just means the virus was created through human intervention.

While I'm agnostic on this issue - for the time being more inclined to believe the virus is entirely natural, but my views are subject to future revision in the case of new info, eg. once I read papers like this one once it's published - it's at *plausible* the virus was humanly created and accidentally leaked. Of course, it's also possible it's just a coincidence and the virus was transmitted to humans via food ingestion in the Wuhan food market. The point is that we don't know. But whatever the case, ""lab creation"" can perfectly be compatible with a lab leak - contrary to your post, that very stupidly assumes ""lab creation"" must mean ""intentionally leaked from the lab by malicious actors"". It doesn't. This isn't even remotely complicated.

People like you - with a genuine inablity to even process exceedingly simple logical structures while on a  mission to constantly berate others as ""conspiracy theorists"" - that are the problem.

Just as an experiment, how do you think your parents and your friends would react if you told them you are a homosexual ? 

This rainbow is also a sign of support to all of lgbt youth who are hiding this from their families, and waiting to be independent to be themselves. 

People won’t stop being harassed for being gay just because a rainbow was painted on the road. But some people will remember that we exist seing this flag. It’s a message to all of those who hate us and don’t want to see us living our life freely, that we will always be here and that their hate will never make us disappear. That harassing us is pointless. 

And no, we don’t want everyone to go about their lives as if everything was fine. I’m happy that 95% of the people have the chance to leave a peacefull life, and be as free as they want. But i really don’t care if they feel disturbed for 5 minutes when they see a rainbow flag : it won’t change their lives, but it will make them think and it will remind them that 5% of the population are not so lucky. 

You can’t solve a problem if you don’t make it visible to the general population. 

Really : why do you feel a bit annoyed ? reading you, it feels like your everyday life is flooded in lgbt flag and lgbt representation, when in reality i’m pretty sure that it’s not so common. What is the real reason ? i bet you don’t feel annoyed when people are wearing a cross aroung their neck, or even when they wear a t-shirt with a foreign country flag or symbol.",,/r/europe/comments/npobap/ultratraditionalists_covering_up_the_rainbow/h06niat/,Apoq-alipse,1622549267

And what will they do then if displeased about the state infringing on their rights? Parade like Belarusians? Attack the military with kitchen knives and sticks? 

The only way to fight an army is to become the army - and all armies are authoritarian by design, else they are just rioters easily dispersed and dealt with. The Swiss have it right, with all citizens receiving military training and weapons to keep at home. That is how historical democracies worked, like in Athens - the citizens were the army and the fleet, and it is hard to violently oppress your own army.

Else you might just throw rocks at tanks.

&gt; where we see just how hard it is to fight for democracy, people still sleep

Standing vigil presupposes a system that provides you with food, sleep and security, and can give swift response if anything happens during your vigil.

AKA the army. Or the police, basically the 0%-alco to the army being the beer. Or the secret service, which is the same as army intelligence.

&gt; I even see more and more authoritarianly minded people that repeat propaganda about how dictatorships are good at this or that, despite ample evidence to the contrary

Because if the chain of command dies, the army dies. Commands must be obeyed while at war. If you have no army during war, RIP.

I am pretty sure ever since the Corona started, the world is basically at war.

5949,"&gt; Is that sarcasm? Seriously you are making jokes about others fetishes and sexual preferences? Did you ever understood what the rainbow flag stand for? Like for inclusiveness?

The term is called irony. The irony being that you're mad about other people responding to you being mad about some colours on a road. When people paint a road in a bunch of colours you apparently don't like it. When people disagree with you, that's also not okay. Ironic fetish for road colours you have.

&gt; How does traffic lights does affects braking distance? Are you able to argue what you talk about?

Are you? When car light go red, car go stop. When pedestrian light go red, pedestrian no walk. They could paint the road whatever colour they want, the main traffic control in that area are the lights, not the paint of the road.

&gt; Indeed it hurt the pedestrins invested by cars that has lost adherence while braking, but i know that until the accident doesn't happen to you, you don't give a fuck.

If the lights didn't stop either from crossing or driving then the colour of the road isn't going to matter.

You try to deflect your anger about colours into some road safety issue that doesn't exist. Not sure why, but take it up with the local government if you're really that bothered by it.

Correct, you just disqualified your own point, some people get attacked at random and some people get attacked because of their sexual orientation or skintone which is an aggravating factor.   
People going about their life can assume more that they are safe from their fellow man if they are a straight couple holding hands than if they are a gay one, maybe this is news to you idk.

If she had to organise and pay for it herself that's one more thing to think of, or maybe she doesn't think of that and just goes to buy a breakfast every day and wastes time and energy. Also this covers her family, so she doesn't have to think about providing food for her family which also saves energy and mental power. I honestly don't see how having a pretty standard, albeit slightly high, food allowance for the PM is an issue.",European,/r/europe/comments/npljf2/finnish_prime_minister_faces_more_scrutiny_over/h06e6n4/,ArtOfFuck,1622542096

I am going to assume you mean rape is not consensual sex.

I consider literally everything as ""comparable"" in the sense that any two things can be compared to each other (in some aspect or the other).

You're right though that consent is another ""axis"", which I failed to consider. (That too has a bad extreme. You shouldn't be able to have intercourse at all in the other extreme direction because what if they change their mind mid intercourse?)

I suppose it depends on how you actually define the ""extremes"". I considered the axis to be ""freedom to have intercourse as you'd like"". The extreme of going to that end would imply dropping ANY limitations on that; that's sort of what extremism implies generally.",,/r/europe/comments/npobap/ultratraditionalists_covering_up_the_rainbow/h06e90l/,2weirdy,1622542157
