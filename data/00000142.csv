4,"&gt; But if they become a big minority or a majority (which is only a matter of time under current immigration policies)

Time being multiple decades.  A lot can happen during that time, good and bad.  How we handle the process during that time is important.  

&gt; Turkish immigrants in Germany and the Netherlands have not only failed to secularise but are actually more religious than the ones back in Turkey. More likely to vote for horrible leaders like Erdogan too. I also wonder where the attempts to integrate them are supposed to come form when the idea itself is met with outrage. 

You are right, and that is a problem, IMHO.  (and I do not like it)  But part of the German and European ""lifestyle"" is actually allowing people to be religious and vote as they want.  

I don't know how to solve that.  
  
&gt; Meanwhile there's little to no reason to think Europe will change these immigrants. 

If know a few, who were ""changed"", despite being religious.  
  
&gt; The Middle East's intolerance isn't because of poverty. Barbaric state Saudi Arabia is actually one of the richest countries in the world.

18,"Trump is absolutely to blame for pulling out of the Iran deal.  As an American, I am naturally concerned with Iran, and I found the deal the most effective way to mitigate a dangerous and complex geopolitical problem.  Yet, one has to deal with the current political realities and find the best way forward, and going forward it is increasingly worrying that Iran is adopting an ever increasing belligerent stance.  The incidents in the Hormuz Strait, the advanced weaponry given to the Houthis, the recent attack on Saudi Arabia, and the progression of the nuclear program itself which started this whole mess.

If things continue on this trajectory, a military confrontation of some type is inevitable.  Iran feels that to gain any leverage for future negotiations, they have to display the ability to disrupt business as usual for the West.  And it ismnt like Iran was peaceful before, they were just more careful to distance themselves from their proxies and keep conflicts relatively distant from any Western concerns.

So, if the EU wants to act like a superpower, I would hope to see them execute the planned economic aid with Iran that would cause them to cease hostilities and possibly usher in more moderate candidates.

The reality is Trump made a massive mistake by withdrawing, but he truly isnt a war hawk president.  He isnt smart enough to have thought through the consequences of withdrawing, he just wanted to redo the same type of deal and slap his name on it.  He is too concerned with how a war might negatively affect the economy, the one area that might be keeping him in the White House.

So, Iran must be contained.  The US acted like an irrational ally, but that happens in geopolitics when you deal with as many different countries as a powerful bloc.  And you can't forget that Iran has never been the good guys, they have just been the crazy theocracy trying to be contained.  Basically, my point is, now that the US has fucked up, it would be a perfect time for the EU to demonstrate it can solve world issues with it's own power, independent of what Washington wants.  I guess time will tell if their economic packages will manage to defuse the situation. They could use some deft politicians right about now.",,/r/europe/comments/d4m8u0/europeans_want_the_eu_to_act_like_a_superpower/f0gpls6/,JakeAAAJ,1568603820

37,"So I take it you are fine with Iran increasing its military hostilities across the Middle East?  We shouldnt be concerned when the source of a vital resource that is integral to Western economies is threatened?  Do you think given the trajectory of Iranian actions, things will just resolve naturally?  No matter the fault of Trump for pulling out of the deal, Iran was responsible for starting a nuclear program in the first place.  

I guess if you are European and have no real influence on a worldwide geopolitical stage, you can have the luxury of focusing on who made what mistakes and how superior you are to them. But Iran isn't going away, and it would be awfully weird to support Iran because of a mistake an American President made.  They regularly make ""mistakes"" like jailing women for decades for showing their hair, hanging gay people by cranes, you know, moderate Islam stuff.

Perhaps my inferior American mind cannot comprehend how you visualize all of this to work out, maybe as a European you have the luxury of not having a say in how it will work out.  As an American, no matter how we arrived at this situation, Iran cannot be allowed to support attacks on a resource which fuels the global ecomomy.  Such as 5% of the global amount of that resource.  Or should we just sit back and laugh at the dumb Americans as Iran grows increasingly hostile and aggressive?  What exactly do you want us to do with Iran?

108,"&gt; Wilhelm could not wage foreign and economic policy alone. Imperial Germany was not an autocracy. Focusing on his gaffes was useful as propaganda, but otherwise no more serious than British royal family's statements.

He had quite a bit more power than the British royal family to set the direction of the German empire as was ironically established by Bismarck, and as such his words were to be taken more seriously. You don't need to have absolute powerful to be influential, and what influence he had was more than adequate for the British to be concerned about what he was saying.

&gt; Why shouldn't he congratulate a small nation on repelling imperialist advances by the world superpower? Particularly after British warships violated all sorts of international rules searching German merchant ships (which served as a wake-up call that Germant needed a powerful navy).

If you intend to develop a closer relationship with a nation, usually congratulating and appearing to support its enemies is a bad way to go about it, regardless of the justice of the situation. That's why the pro-British government of the US kept public neutrality and zipped lips about the Boer Wars even though many American citizens and media found the underdog republics of the Boers more compelling. 

&gt; In a way that the German fleet, even if it miraculously defeated the British, could still not reach their overseas possessions and trade routes. The USA could.

The point of the German plan was precisely to make it so that the British could incur such losses in fighting them that they would lack the naval strength to preserve their commercial and actual empire. If the British lacked a credible capability to defend their shipping and ship over troops to deal with local rebellions or invasion, it would not long be able to preserve itself. That would be harm enough to their overseas possessions and trade routes, let alone if they'd done the impossible and actually won over the British fleet; that would have allowed them to cut the British off from their empire almost entirely.

Whereas the US was mostly focused on the Americas and the Pacific, areas that weren't terribly important to the British so long as their access to the markets was preserved which was fine by the US anyway.

A knife near your neck is more concerning than a sword on a wall.

&gt; That shows enormous arrogance they were completely unaware of. Can you imagine Germany telling France and Russia - you can only build your armies up to half our strength, anything else would be totally unacceptable? If Germany could outbuild the UK in ships that only showed that the UK was lagging economically. A perfectly natural process, which the UK accepted in relation to the USA.

If you stick your thumb in the eye of the imperial power of the day by explicitly doing the thing they've repeatedly said they don't want you to do, don't be surprised if you don't have the best relations. At the end of the day all those German battleships ended up as so much junk sitting in port, too expensive to risk being used after failing to present a real challenge to the British. It was a boondoggle and a waste of the German taxpayer's money so that Willy could satisfy his ""I want one, too!"" desires for a navy.

London was determined to prevent German domination over the continent. That is why they exaggerated the naval threat and Kaiser's gaffes. You need to prepare the nation for a war psychologically.

340,"&gt;In the context of British imperialistic policy in 19th century which was oriented on destruction of China and caused 150 years of terrible sufferring and humiliation of all Chinese People, reminding that Hong Kong was a British colony is disgusting arrogance.

Which would explain why the people of Hong Kong are waving British flags around and singing the British national anthem outside the embassy. Are they disgustingly arrogant for hating an oppressive regime that massacred and humiliated millions of Chinese people for nearly a century now?

&gt;Hong Kong is an integral part of China, only having special administration promised for 50 years.

Colour me unsurprised that an oppressive regime wants to crush a functioning republic with its boot in order to gain power and control over its people.  

&gt;When Hong Kong was the British colony, there was no democratic administration, only in the end Britain gradually implemented democratic mecahnisms to complicate integration of HK into China.

You do know who it was exactly that caused democratic reform to be postponed in Hong Kong, right?

 '*Liao Chengzhi, a senior Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, said in 1960 that China ""shall not hesitate to take positive action to have Hong Kong, Kowloon and New Territories liberated"" should the status quo (i.e. colonial administration) be changed. The warning killed any democratic development for the next three decades.*'

I'm glad that the British went through with it in the end anyway, everyone deserves the right to self-governance in accordance with democratic principles, but I guess democracy is bad when it comes to Hong Kong specifically according to you.

&gt;Western countries should stop trying to teach China, they have neither moral nor legal mandate to interfere in Chinese internal affairs.

The communist regime has neither the moral or the legal mandate to oppress its citizenry and the citizens of the nations it conquered. If you're so strongly against colonialism, then you should be absolutely disgusted by communist imperialism in Tibet and Xinjiang that lead to the death and suffering of millions.

&gt;China has population 1.4 bilion, 3500 years of political, economical and cultural history. Despite various crisises it has been the most successful state in the human history, which is now only returning to its position. Who dares to teach them how should they organize and rule their country is an arrogant fool.

The Third Reich and Imperial Japan also had a rich history of thousands of years worth of political, economical and cultural development. Who should dare to teach them how they should rule and organise their nations, right?

&gt;Hong Kong is economicaly important but the Chinese Government has responsibility for the whole country.

Hong Kong should be a sovereign state by itself if anything, the people have made it rather clear that they want nothing to do with the communist regime; y'know, being descendants of Chinese refugees and political prisoners that the communist state was trying to oppress into submission and all that fun jazz.

&gt; To think that Chinese government wants to murder and oppress people in Hong Kong is idiocy, but the Chinese government will not give up the control of the territory. Lasting riots can only harm economy of HK, that's all.

How na√Øve. If the communist state was so benevolent as to look out for poor little Hong Kong's economy, they would've simply left it alone and only levied taxes from it. History has already proven that China has grander designs on the city, which is subjugating and beating its citizenry into submission. It would be good for communist PR to bring their 'misguided westernised yokel brethren' under the communist wing. On the other hand, it would be a huge blow to communist propaganda if there was a thriving Chinese state with democratic leadership, because it would mean that communism isn't as good as the ruling party drummed it up to be; and the fact that there would be a much better alternative. The communists can't allow that.

&gt;Your comments about interwar European political problems show only your ignorance of elementary facts. But it is out of the topic of this post.

Your entire post about how great the communist regime is shows *your* wilful ignorance in regards to the millions it killed and oppressed. It's really no wonder why Hong Kong wants independence or British rule again when faced with the alternative, and no amount of Sinophilic propaganda can change that sentiment over there.

372,"I think you may be interested in [this.](https://www.elblogsalmon.com/mundo-laboral/por-que-a-andalucia-y-extremadura-tienen-tasas-de-desempleo-tan-altas) It's just a pretty basic article written in Spanish, but I think it may give you a good idea. One of the biggest problems imo (and just an opinion) as someone from Barcelona (rich city) living in Extremadura (poorest region of the country) is that while other regions got rods, Andaluc√≠a and Extremadura got fishes.

**Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.‚Äù**

While other regions got a lot of help from the central government to create a strong empresarial net the Southerns ones didn't. The North got a great position to interact with the rest of Europe (which is why the North-East is the richest) which ended up benefiting them a lot. The Southerners were seen just as poor, uneducated cheap labor (kinda like the South-North divission in Italy as well.) It reached a point were people from these regions who tried to immigrate to the capital to find a job so they could eat were flat out denied, [being forced to stay outside the city in poor conditions.](https://static3.hoy.es/www/multimedia/201809/08/media/cortadas/moto-papel%20(4)-kD6-U60863316056T9-624x385@Hoy.jpg) Also there are plenty of slurs for people mainly from the South who tried to immigrate up there.

Nowadays the problem is simply endemic. These regions get lot of economic help (which is the reason some North regions want independence and claim that Spain steals them) but it's worth nothing because people can't be bothered. Unlike the Catalan bourgeoisie people have a different mentality. They want a simple, happy life and a lot of them are content which earning just a little bit as long as they make ends, so they don't work or do it in illegal jobs so they don't declare taxes. Also unlike in the North the industry is pretty sad, most just earn money from tourism (and not really high-class, expensive one) so they can't compete with the TIC, modern regions. Agriculture is also big... obviously you aren't gonna get rich like that. Historically Extremadura have never been pretty European (unlike the Catalans who adopted liberalism easy and other humanistic ideas) and have been pretty marginated. The big conquistadors were from Extremadura, before Pizarro went to the Americas he was here taking care of pigs... most people who traveled to the Americans were Andalucians and Extremadurans.  The feudal system, despotism and poverty sadly played a big role in the fate of the South. This poverty isn't new, it does have centuries of history....

And as for Extremadura really is such a big space for so little people that it's ignored. Every investment there benefit just a really small population and it's too expensive given the size... we are absolutely irrelevant in a national level so no politician will ever help develop this region.",,/r/europe/comments/d4iy8f/unemployment_in_european_union_2004_vs_2018/f0fdyea/,FabulousGovernment,1568581870

In 10 years I wouldn't be shocked if we saw self-driving cars exist in more then Waymo tests and glorified lane assist systems. But would they be a safe reality? I heavily doubt that, as both human error exists, and you have to create massive infrastructure to support the new technology.

And well, while I'm myself a car person, I understand why for some people the prospect of all self-driving is so attractive. But at the same time, I'll put it bluntly - most of us are poor. Well, not poverty poor, but also not ""we can just dump our new car and get this new one that the government wants us to get"" rich. For that reason and that reason only we will not be able to properly push human-driven vehicles out of commission and therefore have roads filled with only self-driving vehicles, killing off the probability of human error in any crash (and even then you have human error, as even if the car is built by a robot, someone has to do quality control over said thing).

I dived into the CFA system when Macron visited Mali (iirc). It's essentially a parity system between euro and 2 different CFA moneys, each in a different group of country. The money African countries ""send"" to France remains in their account and allows parity. Because money is complicated essentially. Its 2 biggest advantages is that it allows trade in the region across borders, and a beneficial stability according to the EU. It's a region which has seen Tuareg independentism, Al Qaeda trying to take over Mali, Ebola and Boko Haram. And Mali stayed out of CFA for 22 years before deciding to join it. That's almost like taking part in the CFA system is a legitimate monetary strategy, just like creating the Euro.

There have been some contestable French interventions on Africa, but people criticizing Mali and Central Africa only show off their limited understanding of Africa. Mali was attacked by mfing Al Qaeda, and AQ betrayed even their Tuareg allies. But naaaah, France should have stayed on the side to gain some moral superiority points.

523,"&gt; Shit man, you bought all the bullshit justifications they used then to get you there. Where's the proof that Iraq was developing nuclear weapons? There wasn't any.

Saddam Hussein admitted that he miscalculated President Bush, and believed that by feigning the possession of nuclear weapons by misleading weapons inspectors, it would deter the US from invading or limit the American campaign to airstrikes only, similar to the Gulf War. He also wanted to project to the Iranians that he had nuclear weapons.

The evidence of this was given by Saddam Hussein himself during interrogation:

https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2008/january/piro012808 

https://youtu.be/SBLhU-4WsMI


&gt; In what way did Saddam support jihad?

‚ÄúIraq is one of seven countries that have been designated by the Secretary of State as state sponsors of international terrorism. UNSCR 687 prohibits Saddam Hussein from committing or supporting terrorism, or allowing terrorist organizations to operate in Iraq. Saddam continues to violate these UNSCR provisions.

In 1993, the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) directed and pursued an attempt to assassinate, through the use of a powerful car bomb, former U.S. President George Bush and the Emir of Kuwait. Kuwaiti authorities thwarted the terrorist plot and arrested 16 suspects, led by two Iraqi nationals.
Iraq shelters terrorist groups including the Mujahedin-e-Khalq Organization (MKO), which has used terrorist violence against Iran and in the 1970s was responsible for killing several U.S. military personnel and U.S. civilians.

Iraq shelters several prominent Palestinian terrorist organizations in Baghdad, including the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), which is known for aerial attacks against Israel and is headed by Abu Abbas, who carried out the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro and murdered U.S. citizen Leon Klinghoffer.

Iraq shelters the Abu Nidal Organization, an international terrorist organization that has carried out terrorist attacks in twenty countries, killing or injuring almost 900 people. Targets have included the United States and several other Western nations. Each of these groups have offices in Baghdad and receive training, logistical assistance, and financial aid from the government of Iraq.

In April 2002, Saddam Hussein increased from $10,000 to $25,000 the money offered to families of Palestinian suicide/homicide bombers. The rules for rewarding suicide/homicide bombers are strict and insist that only someone who blows himself up with a belt of explosives gets the full payment. Payments are made on a strict scale, with different amounts for wounds, disablement, death as a ""martyr"" and $25,000 for a suicide bomber. Mahmoud Besharat, a representative on the West Bank who is handing out to families the money from Saddam, said, ""You would have to ask President Saddam why he is being so generous. But he is a revolutionary and he wants this distinguished struggle, the intifada, to continue.""

Former Iraqi military officers have described a highly secret terrorist training facility in Iraq known as Salman Pak, where both Iraqis and non-Iraqi Arabs receive training on hijacking planes and trains, planting explosives in cities, sabotage, and assassinations.‚Äù

 [https://visual.ly/community/infographic/geography/average-male-height-across-europe](https://visual.ly/community/infographic/geography/average-male-height-across-europe) 

Spanish average is above European average.

There are many reasons contributing to that stereotype. The first that come to my mind (I am not a geneticist or a sociologist, so I might be wrong and I would appreciate someone correcting me):

\- Post war, dictatorship Spain was not the best place to grow healthy and tall. Older people, especially grandmas, are almost comically short compared to the younger generation.

\- A lot of Spaniards were born or are descendants of South American countries, in which (because of the orography) people tend to be much shorter. My hypothesis is that as genes get mixed, the average height is also growing.

\- Stereotypes die harder than reality change. People still think of Spain as a homophobic country, for example, when in reality is the opposite.

Also politicians are doing not much to save the south, some of them also try to get the northern regions to stop help the southern once. The mafia is only active in the south and that's an additional reason why it's so bad in that spots and especially Campania, Calabria and Sicily the mafia is very strong.

General Weygand, who was head of his military family‚Äîas the French put it‚Äîsaid: If Marshal Foch were here now, he would not waste time deploring what has been lost. He would say: ‚ÄòDo not yield another yard.‚Äô

&gt; The French Resistance Movement, which here numbered 30,000 men, played a notable part, and the peninsula was quickly overrun.

618,"&gt; All the rationalization you want to throw out there doesn't make the Iraq invasion not a mistake and fuel for what has happened since in the region.

I disagree that it was a mistake. It was a direct result of Saddam‚Äôs continued threat against the US, his material support for Islamic jihad, and the potential to transfer advanced weapon systems to international terrorists. It finally ended Hussein‚Äôs reign of terror. It is was a justified extension of GWOT, and it proved to any enemy, current or future, that the US will hunt you down to whichever country you choose to flee if you are responsible for an attack on America.

&gt; The resolution having bipartisan support doesn't make it good policy, the Americans' handling of former Ba'ath party members' role in the new Iraq directly led to a drastic rise of numbers of insurgents in Iraq leading to the reign of terror of ISIS.

&gt; America absolutely did fuck with the region's stability, the rise of Iran's influence in the region since shows that, America's actual allies in the region would agree to that.

The Iraqi insurgency on the Sunni side was a result of the decision to completely rebuild the Iraqi military to ensure that Ba‚Äôathist leadership did not take on leadership of the new military. In the aftermath of World War II, nazi party members were not allowed in the new German military. So why would you allow enemies to stay in the new Iraqi military to only have to come back again in a couple of decades? However, this decision led to former military members being unemployed, disenfranchised, and left with the feeling of having their country stripped from them and given to the Shia. However, it was their decision to not participate in the elections. It was their decision to ally with foreign terrorists (AQI) against the US coalition. They wanted to fight, so we fought.

On the Shia side, you had several Shia militias supported by Iran from the beginning. Iran supplied these Shia militias with Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFP‚Äôs), which were effective at enabling Improvised Explosive Devices (IED‚Äôs) to penetrate even uparmored vehicles. Iran supplied other heavy weapons as well.

This escalation was not well predicted or desired, but war is unpredictable by nature. Just because the war did not go as smoothly as some would have liked does not mean it was unjustified or unnecessary.

The result was hundreds of thousands dead, including tens of thousands of foreign jihadists who came to Iraq to fight the Americans. Iraq became a graveyard for Islamic jihad. I am okay with that. These foreign jihadists wanted to bring death to our soil. We returned the favor. That is what war is.

You are right that Iran initially benefitted from the power vacuum in the region. It‚Äôs a good thing that Donald Trump was elected President... Now President Trump is severely punishing Iran for what they did to us in Iraq, and what they have done to us for the past 50 years. Their economy is completely fucked. Their ability to support jihad in the region has been severely strained. We will see where it goes from here.

642,"Hello kitty, a Japanese cat-girl with a bright pink bow, is an unusual mascot for European integration. But in July the cartoon character inadvertently became one. Sanrio, Hello Kitty‚Äôs owner, admitted to the European Union (EU) that it had granted trademark licences to business partners on the condition each would sell the ensuing Hello Kitty merchandise‚Äîfrom school bags to pencil cases and duvet covers‚Äîonly in specified EU states. This attempt to treat Europe as a disjointed bundle of countries breaches an article of economic faith: that the EU's 28 members are one single market. The European Commission doled out a ‚Ç¨6.2m ($6.8m) fine.

Maps of Europe still show its various countries separated by borders, some of them not much moved in centuries. Commercially, they are meant to be anachronistic. In theory, at least viewed from Brussels, the EU‚Äôs 500m citizens live in a single economic zone much like America, with nothing to impede the free movement of goods, services, people and capital.

This single-market policy has underpinned Europe‚Äôs continued, if somewhat diminishing, importance to the global economy. But three decades after it was dreamed up, Europe‚Äôs commercial unification is creaking. In parts it is incomplete and in others actively going backwards. At a time when Britain is attempting to leave the EU and trade wars loom, this is worrying. The health of the single market is vital to Europe‚Äôs economy.

Less united states

The single market is an economic arrangement unlike any other. Its origins lie in a series of treaties signed in the 1950s, creating what was to become the EU. Their aim was to weld the French and German economies so closely together as to make war impossible, for example by creating a common market in coal and steel. Economic integration gradually deepened. In 1993 the single market proper came into existence, promising ‚Äúan area without internal frontiers‚Äù. All EU countries (and some others, like Norway and Switzerland) vowed to abolish not just tariffs but myriad non-tariff barriers that hamper trade.

One of the single market‚Äôs underlying principles is that decisions made in one EU country‚Äîwhether a car is safe to drive or a financial product fit for investors‚Äîshould be recognised by all others. Some regulation is harmonised and ruled upon by EU bodies, as with the regulation of big banks. More often, European rules are transposed into each country‚Äôs law and applied by national watchdogs. The EU‚Äôs fierce privacy regulations, for example, are enforced not by Brussels but by 28 national agencies.

The arrangement is thus a sort of free-trade agreement on steroids. Estimates vary, but EU countries trade roughly half as much with each other as states in America but twice as much as they would in a looser arrangement. All EU countries, with the exception of Britain and Ireland, trade more with other EU countries than with the outside world. Cross-border supply chains in Europe have more foreign inputs from neighbouring countries than those in Asia or North America.

Yet the importance of the single market is fading. Like all rich-world economies, Europe is shifting from the making of goods to the provision of services, such as banking, cloud computing and child care. Such services now make up nearly three-quarters of EU GDP, up from around two-thirds before the single market; all the net new jobs created in Europe in the past decade have been in services.

The single market, on the other hand, was originally devised for goods‚Äîstuff made with the steel and coal from which the ever-closer union was to be built. Markets for such goods could be liberalised by opening up borders, or boosted by agreeing joint rules on things like product safety.

Abolishing barriers to trade in services is much harder. ‚ÄúWhat stops services moving across borders is how they are regulated by different countries,‚Äù says Jonathan Faull, a former commission official now with Brunswick Group, a consultancy. ‚ÄúSome of that regulation goes back to medieval guilds.‚Äù

National politicians have long been hesitant to take on the lawyers, pharmacists and taxi drivers of the service economy. As a result, only in 2006 was a fresh set of commitments made to include services in the single market. Even then, many industries ended up being exempt entirely. For services that were covered, implementation has been patchy.

No way to say goodbye

By the EU's own estimate, 5,000 national regulations exist to protect the delivery of different types of services in its member states‚Äînearly 200 per country. Denmark, for example, demands law firms be 90% owned by lawyers qualified or registered there. A Swedish lawyer looking to offer advice across the Oresund strait cannot easily do so without significant hassle.

Similarly, lots of jobs require practitioners to register with professional bodies‚Äîoften a tiresome process. Though not overtly designed to hamper trade, the rules often have that effect.

Tackling this kind of de facto protectionism is essential if the single market is to keep pace with Europe‚Äôs ever more service-led business landscape, says Nicolas V√©ron of Bruegel and the Peterson Institute for International Economics, two think-tanks. ‚ÄúIf you do nothing to deepen the single market [to include services],‚Äù he says, ‚Äúit covers a shrinking part of the economy.‚Äù

Brussels once had the stomach for such liberalisation. It crafted new rules designed to curb protectionism and cracked down on countries that failed to enforce them. But in 1999 many of those who might have continued the push for abolishing commercial borders shifted their attention to another ambitious federalist project‚Äîthe euro. A decade later, all their energies went into battling for the survival of their single currency as it descended into crisis. ‚ÄúThe single market disappeared off the agenda for several years,‚Äù says Stefano Micossi of Assonime, a trade group.

Mario Monti, a former European commissioner and Italian premier, once put the post-crisis lull in single-market activism down to a mix of ‚Äúintegration fatigue‚Äù, meaning few wanted a fresh push for ever-closer union; and ‚Äúmarket fatigue‚Äù, an all-round disenchantment with according primacy to the role of the market. Fans of services liberalisation originally estimated that it would result in EU GDP being boosted by 0.8-1.8% over a decade. But that ‚Äúbonus‚Äù never materialised, further sapping enthusiasm for the project.

The effect is starting to be felt. It was once assumed Europe would move to ever-closer economic relations. That is no longer the case. Consider banking. With the advent of the euro, lenders increasingly ventured beyond their national borders to the rest of Europe. In the decade to 2007, the share of bonds held by EU banks issued in countries other than the banks‚Äô own tripled to 46%‚Äîovertaking the amount of bonds they held issued by companies and government entities in their own countries. The prospect of a true pan-European financial market seemed close. The trend quickly reversed with the financial crisis [(see chart one)](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20190914_FBC513.png). Financial integration is now on hold. Banks currently make 85% of loans to companies in their own country.


Another indicator of economic convergence is the extent to which people pay the same price for the same goods in different parts of an economic area. In a seamless market, for example within a country, prices should equalise as firms arbitrage differences.

For years, this measure pointed to rapid convergence in the EU. The continent was coming together and turning into something akin to America (though itself not a perfect single market). But again in 2008, progress stalled [(see chart one)](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20190914_FBC513.png). Firms in increasingly cosseted national markets are freer now to raise prices without losing share to other European firms. Part of that is down to the shift towards services, some of which are hard to trade. A hairdresser in Bratislava will struggle to attract customers from Lisbon.

Other measures do point to continuing integration‚Äîbut one is soon to be disrupted. Since 2007, the number of Europeans living in an EU country other than their own has more than doubled, to around 17m. But the second-most-popular destination after Germany is due to leave within months. Although European citizens are expected to be able to stay in Britain for a time, and vice versa, the number of Europeans living in a country other than their own will fall by nearly a third overnight.

646,"Go your own way

How the single market works in practice does much to determine the opportunities open to the EU‚Äôs firms and thus the shape of its economy. European companies selling goods can make use of the single market, reaching scale and so profitability quickly. They have an edge over those that sell services. Partly as a result, Europe is a continent of goods companies. Fully 21 of the EU's 25 biggest listed firms supply goods, including cars, make-up, alcohol and planes. Two decades ago the same was true in America‚Äîwhere now 17 of the 25 biggest companies provide services such as software, data plans and bank accounts.

This matters: services companies are, on the whole, more productive than those making goods. That usually translates into higher salaries for their employees. Services companies spring up quickly. America‚Äôs five biggest companies are tech giants mainly focused on services (and gadgets, in the case of Apple) with an average age of just 30, worth $4.3trn between them, 35 times last year‚Äôs profits. Europe‚Äôs biggest firms all existed in one form or another a century ago‚Äîthink of Unilever and Royal Dutch Shell. Combined, they are worth under $1trn, about 23 times last year‚Äôs profits.

It is not just European multinationals that are smaller. The splintered European market means there are three times as many services companies in the EU as in America. Italy has roughly as many firms as America, despite an economy one-tenth as big. Being undersized saps productivity as firms lack the capacity to adopt new technologies. Around 30% of Europeans work for a company with ten or fewer employees, three times the figure in America and over twice the rate in Japan.

Stunted market opportunities make it hard for companies to raise venture capital. Those stay-at-home banks can also charge higher interest rates to corporate borrowers, having fended off EU competitors who might have eaten away lending margins. Consumers foot the bill.

Similarly, markets are dominated by national champions who can get away with higher prices. In telecoms, Europe has dozens of operators‚Äîbut in no country can consumers pick from more than three or four. That means the telecoms firms have all the rent-seeking advantages of oligopolies, but none of the economies of scale available to Chinese or American rivals.

European energy markets are equally fragmented. That means higher prices for consumers and businesses. It also stifles investment, not least for renewable-energy projects.

If Europe were a true single market, firms based there would expand at home before venturing overseas, as American tech firms typically do. But the incompleteness of the single market means they are far likelier to expand outside the club. Data from Morgan Stanley, a bank, show that EU firms in 1997 made nearly three-quarters of their sales in wealthy parts of Europe. Today the figure is under half. The bigger a European firm gets, the less it relies on sales to EU countries other than its own [(see chart two)](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20190914_FBC201.png). This suggests that business bosses view their domestic market as their home country, not the EU.

Big European firms have invested in emerging markets instead. In part, this is to chase economic growth. But the frustrations of doing business in foreign parts of the EU must also be a factor. A database put together by The Economist of large companies based in five EU countries shows European companies are ever keener to invest anywhere but their home continent.

The 300 or so firms who break down foreign sales, as reported in Bloomberg, attach less importance to Europe than they once did. Ten years ago, 35% of their sales came from EU countries other than their national home market, versus 29% for the rest of the world. Now, despite a ten-percentage-point increase in exports, the share of European sales has dropped to 30%, while 44% of sales go farther afield.

European firms are less anchored to their home continent as a result. The boss of Schneider Electric, a French blue-chip engineering company, is now based in Hong Kong. In 2000 over 75% of the money spent by European companies on cross-border takeovers was earmarked for other European companies. In the past few years the figure has been under 50%, according to Dealogic, a data provider.

Policymakers in Brussels point to cross-border trade within Europe rising. This is true. But that is a feature of a far wider increase in imports and exports: trade outside the EU is rising nearly as fast. Globalisation has proved just as potent a force as Europe‚Äôs push towards integration.

Why has the single market not lived up to its promise? Part of it may be down to Europe‚Äôs many tongues, a natural barrier that no legislation will ever remedy. But a survey conducted in 2015 suggests this is a hurdle for only 45% of companies‚Äîversus 83% who fear administrative complexity when crossing EU borders.

The digital economy is particularly damaged by this red tape. Around 40% of European websites do not sell to consumers based in other member states; 77% of online sales are domestic. While EU digital firms stick close to home, limiting opportunities for expansion, the likes of Netflix and Amazon have seized dominant positions in the EU. This is one reason why Europe has only 47 ‚Äúunicorns‚Äù (unlisted startups valued at over $1bn), compared with 97 in China and 194 in America.

Nor is it clear the situation will improve soon. The past few years have been, at best, a period of stasis. ‚ÄúThe single market is not a project people can get behind,‚Äù says Christian Odendahl of the Centre for European Reform. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt a vote-winner.‚Äù

The European Commission, which enforces the single market, has not given up. In recent years it has focused on building cross-border links in specific areas, such as energy and capital markets, with varying degrees of success. On June 6th it threatened all 28 EU countries with lawsuits if they failed to improve cross-border access to services. But the number of ‚Äúenforcement actions‚Äù it has undertaken to bring wayward governments back on track has nearly halved in a decade. This suggests either fewer new rules or less diligence in enforcing them.

Knowing me, knowing EU

Ursula von der Leyen, the incoming commission president (pictured), hardly mentioned the single market in a speech outlining her agenda in July. That is perhaps not surprising given her political champions, Germany and France, have other priorities. Germany, with its world-class manufacturers and less competitive service firms, enjoys the status quo. And like France it is calling for a more energetic ‚Äúindustrial policy‚Äù in which politicians would steer state funding and protection to favoured sectors‚Äîthe antithesis of the single-market approach.

Britain, once the biggest champion of the single market, would previously have provided a counterweight. But now in its place are a coalition of pro-market small countries, including Sweden and Ireland, that lack its heft. The single market looks set to remain a third-order priority.

Wopke Hoekstra, the finance minister of the Netherlands, another traditional champion of the single market, recently warned in a speech that Europe could not continue ‚Äúapplying bricks-and-mortar rules to a digital economy‚Äù.

No wonder that more people are employed if companies (particularly small and medium-sized ones) can get away with paying way less in 2018 than they used to pay in 2004 pre-austerity. Tourism is also responsible for a good chunk of the economy and better not talk of salaries and work conditions there - but hey, at least they have jobs I guess.

As an example, I am a pharmacist and when I graduated around 10 years ago the pay for 40-hour week work, with a proper work contract, was around EUR 1200 month (extra hours and nights were paid on top).  Now, most pharmacists I know are working 50 or 60-hour weeks with no real contracts (""recibos verdes""), working day and night and making 500 per month if they are lucky. My cousin is a graphic designer and when she has work she makes like 400 a month, and my other cousin is a recently graduated nurse making 500 per month working dog hours in a private hospital (none has a work contract, obviously). Minimum wage in Portugal is like EUR 700, by the way. Salaries in Portugal for people with degrees went down significantly compared to the rest of OECD, anyone who thinks Portugal is a great place to work just needs to move there and report back. 

With regards to politics, there is not a huge divide between both major opposing parties (PS and PSD) so talking about left and right politics in Portugal does not mean the same as in other countries IMO.

723,"Hey, you don't actually seem to know how the EU works, which is normal, it's a complex institution, and there is a lot of misinformation and lies about it, especially in the UK. So I'll try to simply explain how the EU works.

Lets go from the top down. At the top, we have the ***European Council***. The European Council is comprised of the heads of government. It has zero legislative powers, but dictates the overall policy that the EU follows. They also control European foreign policy directly. Typically the head of government is directly elected by the people of their country.

Next we have The ***European Commission*** (the executive branch). The EC is formed by Commissioners, who form a cabinet. Every member state appoints one Commissioner (similar to how presidents/prime ministers directly appoint their own ministers/secretaries at home, so too do they appoint a European Commissioner). They are appointed and dismissed by national governments, so their terms vary. The Commission proposes legislation (often requested by the parliament or by the European Council). However, they only have the power to propose, not to enact. Once legislation is passed by the Council and Parliament, it is the Commission's responsibility to ensure it is implemented. It does this through the member states or through its agencies. (They are appointed by YOUR government. Not by the EU. Not by bureaucrats).

Then we have the legislative. This has 2 parts.

The ***European Parliament*** is elected directly by the people of the member states every 5 years. It can approve legislation, propose amendments to legislation, or reject it completely. However, only the Commission may propose new legislation. In addition to it's legislative powers, it elects the President of the Commission, and approves (or rejects) the appointment of the Commission as a whole. It can subsequently force the Commission as a body to resign by adopting a motion of censure. In 2014 The European Parliament explicitly raised doubts about the appointment of Rocco Buttiglione as Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security due to his views on women and homosexuality, and forced several changes within the Commission before it would approve it.

The second part of the legislature is The ***Council of Ministers***. The CoM (as the name suggests) is made up of government officials from the member states. Therefore, their terms in office vary depending on the state and on election results. The Council membership changes depending on the topic at hand. e.g. If the legislation is agricultural- all the agricultural ministers meet to discuss legislation, if the legislation is financial- all the financial ministers meet, and so forth. The Council either passes legislation proposed by the Commission, or adopts a ''common position'' (submits a new version of the legislation to the Parliament, Parliament and the CoM then have a send ), if the bill is not approved by the Council's third reading of the bill, it is abandoned. The CoM are YOUR ministers. The UK Finance Minister will be the one representing the UK on finance matters in the CoM. The UK Agriculture Minister will be the one representing the UK on agricultural matters in the CoM.

Finally, we have the Judiciary branch- The ***European Court of Justice***. The Court of Justice consists of 28 Judges (one from every country) who are assisted by 11 Advocates-General. They are appointed with the agreement of the governments of member states. They have 6 year terms. The ECJ is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the law, and annulling EU legal acts if found to be in violation of EU law or fundamental rights. Yes, these judges are not directly elected. Just like the judged in the UK are not directly elected. Because the courts should be above politics.

This is all very broad, and the EU is a very complex institution, but I hope this helps people know a little more about it.",,/r/europe/comments/d4idwf/brexit_has_changed_eu_view_of_scotland/f0dd421/,thebeastisback2007,1568552590

741,"**German retired general Jochen Both sharply criticised Chancellor Angela Merkel for too low budget of Bundeswehr and for the ""dramatic"" state of the army. The officer took part in the war in Kosovo and commanded the ISAF air force in Afghanistan.**

‚Äì The truth is, the Bundeswehr is in bad shape. Would we be able to defend our own country and our allies? Of course not. For example, in the case of a Russian attack, without the enormous support of the Americans, we would not have survived - said Both in an interview with the magazine edition of the newspaper ""Bild"" - ""Bild am Sonntag"" (""BamS""). He claimed that 20 years ago, when he commanded the Luftwaffe operations in Kosovo, not everything was perfect either, but ""today is dramatic"".



According to the German officer, Germany's failure to meet its NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defence is a breach of a promise that leads to a loss of confidence in power.

‚Äì It is the Chancellor (Merkel) who is responsible for this. She is thus making it clear that for her, there are more important things than the Bundeswehr, that is to say, the security of citizens. The problem is also that such decisions are made without any justification for public opinion. If I had commanded my soldiers in this way, they would not have listened to me - accuses Both.

‚Äì I'm disappointed with Angela Merkel. During her reign, 14 years ago, a serious and lengthy debate about what the Bundeswehr can and must do was neglected. Neither has public confidence in the Bundeswehr increased during her term of office. This is something that should also be discussed much more - the former commander postulates.

In 2014, during the Newport summit in Wales, NATO states committed to increase their military spending to 2% of GDP annually within 10 years. It will be difficult for Germany to fulfil even its own later promise - 1.5%. The budget plans of the Minister of Finance, Olaf Scholz (SPD), for 2020-23 even predict a reduction in the percentage of GDP spent on defence. In 2023, it will amount to 1.26% of GDP.



Germany has long been criticised - mainly by the Trump administration - for assigning too low a percentage of GDP for defence. The American president is threatening to relocate some of the US soldiers stationed on the Rhine to Poland.

The issue of spending on the Bundeswehr is also one of the most controversial topics in the ruling coalition of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats from the SPD. The latter do not want to increase the army's budget.

At the same time, experts have been warning for many years that the Bundeswehr has serious equipment shortages, excessive bureaucracy, and the system for attracting new recruits and employees is working very poorly. Confidential reports from the Ministry of Defence, published in early 2019 by the daily ""Bild"", say that the German armed forces are missing 25,000 people. The Bundeswehr currently has less than 183,000 soldiers.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/d4k6l1/germany_general_jochen_both_sharply_criticises/f0dde4k/,Duchowicz,1568552699

It is a hindsight explanation. Had you asked British citizens, or statesmen, who were a friendlier power in the 1890s, they would not have agreed on whether it was Germany or the USA. Only once a public campaign of ""Germany is a threat"" was launched did the USA start to look friendly.

&gt;and a huge German navy is much more worrisome because it has to sail right by the British to go anywhere.

Actually, due to geographical considerations, the German navy was always much less of a threat to British interests than the US one. It was a fabricated danger. Even a German navy considerably stronger than the British one could not threaten the British empire.

927,"&gt; What you're describing is already happening for quite a while now  

Yup, but we still have games that can be played completely offline. If torrenting is legalised then say bye to those games. No one would make them any more, because it would be fully legal to download them for free. You would not need any torrent sites. You could just host isos on your server and give them away for free. Also if DRM is banned that also means that consoles will have no DRM either. I don't see SONY or Microsoft ever agreeing to do that.

Anti-cheat is related to DRM. Before any console is jailbroken - no one is able to cheat in online games using that console. Before the PS3 was jailbroken anyone could buy the console, go online and be 100% confident that everybody is playing fair.

&gt; Let me guess, you're not from Europe.  

I am from Europe. But I'm no longer a teen. I have a job and money and I can afford to buy my entertainment. I have 0 reason to steal stuff any more. My Steam library is huge already. 

I actually was involved with some people who planned to found our local pirate party. But it didn't get anywhere for the reasons I mentioned before.

&gt; Most of the sw you quoted already moved to a subscription model with lifespans far shorter than 5y (usually it's monthly/annual). 

But if DRM is banned then no one would keep me from using the software once my subscription ends. And as I said - 5 year old versions are still very good. You can still create awesome drawings with PhotoShop from 2014. SolidWorks that I used back in university was really good back then. And so on.

940,"Oh us [Danes also have one, called Fregatten Jylland](http://www.fregatten-jylland.dk/historie), sorry it is in danish. I have linked the English wiki at the end.

I just wanted to point out the most quintessential danish thing, which can be found on this web page I linked to. We Danes have this inferiority complex that makes us prone to argue about stuff we have built, making them record holders, or in some other way the best/biggest/longest etc. This specific thing is found in the last paragraph ‚ÄúVerdens l√¶ngste bevarede‚Äù (the world's longest preserved) which argue that depending on definitions and such Fregatten Jylland is the longest preserved sea faring ship made of wood that currently exists in the world. There have existed longer ships, and there are also ships today that are longer, but then let us argue that they are not fit to be placed on that pedestal.

But it become humorous when they try to argue that Fregatten Jylland is the record holder. [The ship currently holding the world record](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hashemi-II) was never built to sail, and has never set sail, another nail in the longest ship title for that non-sailing ship is apparently that if you calculate the bowsprit as part of the length, then Fregatten Jylland is longer.

Another apparent non-contender is the [ferry-boat Eureka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_(ferryboat)), that is according to the text a ferry, and thus a boat and not a ship.

Just to get the details straight Fregatten Jylland's length is calculated as 71 meters, and with the bowsprite 99 m. Al Hashemi II is 83,75 m long, and Eureka is 91,3 meters.

The quintessential danish thing we witness here, is that if we cannot compete on even ground with straight facts, we make up parameters to make our ship the greatest. It becomes kind of sad to witness in the long run.

Sorry for the ramble, I just find it humorous, and wanted to share.

America has special interaction rules. I see, on the askreddit, advice on how to create rapport between strangers also stuff like ""ask them about themselves, everybody loves an opportunity to talk about themselves"", which would not work around me, it would be seen as prying.

Randomly complimenting people  can be seen as fake, or getting into their own private place. It might work on some cultures, it will probably not work on others.

You can socialize, probably, though by the way european is not a culture or nationality, greeks and finns do not act on the same norms. But keep in mind over enthusiastic can come off as fake. Look at this interaction

It's a big contrast to Russia which actually knows how to play the influence game in the West. We in Czechia nowadays have a feud between Prague officials both with China and Russia (the one with Russia is with a specific municipality concerning a statue of a Russian WW2 general that is placed in the municipality). So we can see a real life case study how much more effective Russia is (they know our system, know that if they have a problem with local politicians that come from parties which are in an opposition in the parliament, it doesn't make a sense to throw a stink with the governmemt let alone punish random musicians' groups that wanted to perform in Russia. They know it's much smarter to demonize the politicians in question and try to turn a part of the Czech political scene/general public against them.

China on the other hand does not differentiate if it's a local politicians, government, opposition or what they just go for broad punishments which only really achieve that a bigger part of the politicial scene is alienated. I don't know if they do it because they are just really ignorant of our system or if they just don't really care about us and just want to send a message this way to other countries which are more important to them.

1007,"So why do Romanian persons complain? 

1. Kingblana is rude with persons from other regions that ain't from Transylvania.
2. He is agenda pushing. The name of villages and stuff like that in 3 languages is done by Liga Transilvania Democrata (a separatist movement of sort). He's been doing thing for 2-3 years now btw. The guys are nuts and think that Transilvania is special in a way. (Even OP said that Dobrudja is Kazakhstan and Transylvania is Luxembourg on this own sub some time ago. If you read their comments on facebook they are pretty spicy and special about the other regions of Romania). It's the same as people having the need to say Dresden when they talk about Gdansk,  K√∂nigsberg when they talk about Kalingrad and 10 names for Alsace and Lorraine. When this happens the guys are usually downvoted to hell. 
3. In most things he posts there is no need for 3 names simply cause minorities don't live there anymore. Most Saxon villages are inhabitated now by  [gypsies](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romii_din_Rom%C3%A2nia#/media/Fi%C8%99ier:Romi_Romania_media_2002.png).  Also Transylvania isn't the only ""multicultural"" region as OP likes to say. In Dobrduja there were villages with Germans/Hungarians/Greeks/Bulgarians/Armenians/Tatars/Turks/Lipovans and Jews. He never posted anything about that region just Transylvania with 3 names for the past 2 years every week. 
4. I don't support the Romanians that complain everytime as they should just and let OP do his agenda pushing. I'm quit sick of seeing someone typing Romania everytime he posts, but it is what it is.

The results are appalling. 

Can I just say to our European friends, when you hear Boris Johnson claiming to represent the ‚Äúwill of the people‚Äù, it‚Äôs not actually like that at all:

62% OF THE UK ELECTORATE HAVE NOT VOTED TO LEAVE THE EU.

Surprised? It‚Äôs true. 

Longer story short: (ignoring all the lies being peddled about the joys of leaving ) it‚Äôs harder to get people out bed to vote for no change and we didn‚Äôt require a majority of the electorate to turn up and vote for such a momentous, generational screw up. 

But the fact remains, startling as it may sound, that 62% of the UK electorate have NOT voted to leave the EU. That silent majority is trying to find a voice but the crazies on the right have closed down parliament in a bid to force us out. 

So forgive me for saying this again:

Both were supporting each other in a good number of their foreign policy endeavors, pursued mutual goals in opening up markets, and had massive links in investment, trade, and immigration ties. It‚Äôs not as concerning if another power is rising if they are acting friendly to you and have minimal political interest in your backyard.

Germany didn‚Äôt stick to a lane of being friendly with the British. It oscillated between pro Russia and pro British policies which had the net effect of alienating both sides which had no idea where Germany would actually fall, and a huge German navy is much more worrisome because it has to sail right by the British to go anywhere. When Germany stuck to the naval arms race despite being told by the British how they didn‚Äôt like it, it meant that the British had to spend massive amounts of money that could have otherwise gone to other endeavors to ensure naval superiority in the vicinity of the home isles, which is the fundamental cornerstone of British security.

Also, Wilhelm in addition to questionable policy let him get quoted as whining out a diatribe about how the English were being jerks and hating on him and went on about how the Germans hate the English and wanted to support their political enemies.

When you want to mass produce a new gun, creating all the new production tools and machines takes a long time.

1263,"I‚Äôm sorry? 

The U.K. is not the only country in Europe. Look at any other mainland European electorate and you will find it is much more diverse than you may think. There are often 2-3 ‚Äúmajor‚Äù parties, but there is always around 5+ minor-interest parties that more or less end up doing their job for their voters. Sure, several parties will vote on the same thing, but at least you as a voter feel as though you are voting for a party you actually support. 

And with that, there is far less bipartisan corruption. 

In European systems, there is much less division and hatred between parties because they must often form coalitions based on their similarities to pass legislation that they agree on. This also ensures that there is less of that sketchy control over new legislation ‚Äî there‚Äôs a more diverse group of people to call bullshit and propose new ideas. In essence, there‚Äôs more checks &amp; balances within the legislature. Unlike in America, where bills are introduced almost monthly that appear to help only large corporations, where several people are being seemingly paid-off by said industry.

Telecom., ISPs, Big Pharma, Big Tobacco, insurance companies, financial groups, tech groups... they all have their hand in US influence and the lobbyist game. Why are pharmaceutical companies able to price their drugs so high? Lack of regulation.

Why are they unregulated? More importantly, why have these drug companies been unregulated for so long?

The only logical answer is political lobbying and/or bribery.

Also, those smaller factions you talk about definitely do not exist in US politics. If you were say, a Republican Congressman, and started to support Libertarian ideology *by yourself* (such as pro-choice abortion), you would lose nearly all support from your fellow Republicans and be labeled anti-loyalist to the party. Re-election would be largely impossible. If you do not align yourself with their strict ideals, you are not a Republican.

"" Extremely complicated"" and ""very difficult"" to compare, especially when doing so internationally.  

So it kind of goes to what I was saying which is that when doing these comparisons, especially late in the war, they could be pretty inaccurate.  

I always think of Speer as an Architect, and forget he was in charge of 'Armaments'.  Guess it helps to be friendly with Hitler during wartime...

1381,"Which is a political institution that both countries voluntarily set up. Monetary policy should lie with states. In this case it is given partially over to the EU and ECB. It should not reside in private companies trying to make a profit by essentially starting a new currency.

Agree with the EU or not, saying: ""What sovereignty? The sovereignty that the EU has over France and Germany?"" Is not helping. It's just making the conversation about something completely different and irrelevant to the situation. Whataboutism isn't a way to structure an argument and it does not excuse a private company to start printing their own currency.

And let's talk about that sovereignty. Germany and France voluntarily handed over certain matters of policy to the EU. Monetary and fiscal policy being some of the duties the EU has. A country can at any time take those matters back into their own hands by stepping out of the EU. This does, however, end any benefits the country would have from being in the EU. Be it Schengen, the free market, freedom of movement or the strength of the Euro. Taking those matters back is still a very complicated task. We can see this with Brexit.

The EU derives its power from the member states. They give the EU institutions power to make decisions on their behalf. (Almost) Every state of the EU choses to go by and enforce the legislation the EU makes. The EU has no police force or military to force its member states to do anything. So if they don't want to they can while their asses with the Maastricht Treaty (*couch* Hungary *cough*) and risk getting kicked out of the union or other punishments that are agreed upon by other members.

If a person choses to let a restaurant cook for them that person is not giving away his right to cook his own food, they are just outsourcing that job to someone that might do it better. The same with the EU. It's members agreed to give over some power for benefits like peace, growth, free movement, and loads of others. They can take that power back but they'll pose the benefits too. Like how you can also decide to cook for yourself the next day instead of going to a restaurant.",,/r/europe/comments/d4b6fx/france_and_germany_agree_to_block_facebooks_libra/f0a7n0a/,JoeBieAwesome,1568511543

1396,"I'm consistently amazed at the thousand year history of almost constant warfare between our disparate nations. And yet we're still neighbours, peace has reigned for an unprecedented amount of time now between our proud, fractious states. A lot of our cultures may be lost on outsiders, but this history is \*ancient\*. How proud I am of how far we've come, how grateful I am that I don't have to be conscripted into dying in some desperate field in the France every other generation. How can we throw this away, fellow brits? Forgive my sentimentalism. My friends often call me alarmist, but the right wing insurgence across Europe and most infamously in my own country, not only gives me a great deal of concern - but almost depression. How can we waste this opportunity? Lasting peace in a continent that for millennia that has only known war. The mere mention of fractious sentiment should be given the elevation it deserves - it is backwards. It is a throwback of what once was. How thankful I am that much our mutual hatred has turned into essentially a meme. Its not a bad thing, humour is the ultimate healer. I know feel like I have more in-common with the various Europeans I've been lucky to become close friends with than many of my own countrymen. How often has that ever been a possibility? I care not much for the political institutions of the EU, but for its foundational ideals and the people that populate it.   

This is the first chance of many, many generations to founder European brotherhood. It's so fragile right now. Perhaps since it's first inception it was only a fools hope.

1492,"&gt; You don't get the difference between ""immigrant-children"" and ""NON-immigrant-children"", do you? You should read my comments again.

&gt; What the hell is wrong with you?

I've reread them and that particular instance was indeed my mistake due to tunnel vision, I'm sorry about that. It doesn't change the rest of our discussion, though, so I'll readdress that part here:

&gt; Kinda also allows the non-immigrant-children to actually learn stuff, but whatever, they don't have rights.

This speculates that allowing immigrant children entry would harm the ability of citizen children to ""learn stuff"". That's not what any of the previous immigration waves indicate.


&gt;  I was answering to this: 
&gt;&gt; While this may at first glance appear to be designed to make school lessons more streamlined all it really accomplishes is further widening the social rift between immigrant and citizen children, ensuring the next generation will have to deal with even more parallel societies of ""lower class"" citizens.

&gt; Because THAT GUY believes that NON-immigrant-children have no right to an education for fucks sake!

1519,"It seems you have your terms mixed. 

""Commercial exclusivity"" is not what you think it is. ""Commercial exclusivity on copyrighted works"" are those that have a ""profit motive"" and NOT those that are for commercial users like you seem to believe. Really, it's even in the link you provided. Practically, it is not music/film/games/software for ""commercial users"" (e.g. businesses), but for ""commercial use"" as in ""for sale of goods/services in exchange for a monetary value"". The opposite is ""non-commercial use"" as in freeware/FOSS and not ""non-commercial users"" (e.g. individuals).

&gt; if DRM is banned then anti-cheating solutions are banned as well.

Cheating existed before and after the introduction of DRM. I don't think even the designers of DRM had anti-cheats in mind. In other words, cheating in games has NOTHING to do with DRM. Also, it is absolutely clear that you have never even heard of gog.com, so check it out - for your own good.

&gt; also means that I can rip assets out of games and distribute them

Provided that the game allows you to do so, then yes, but this is about copyright and not proprietary vs source-available software vs open-source software, as that is a whole other debate.

&gt; A lot of software has good versions that are 5 years old. Photoshop, 3ds max, maya, solidworks, etc

Most of the sw you quoted already moved to a subscription model with lifespans far shorter than 5y (usually it's monthly/annual).

&gt; It's aimed at a moocher who doesn't create anything and downloads shit without paying.

Let me guess, you're not from Europe. In fact, I'd even guess GOP. If that is the case, then you are definitely NOT (nor should you ever be) a potential PP voter, but way to go on showing respect for anyone that might not share your political preferences.

&gt; Because it would force all game developers to move either to streaming - so no more games that you can play offline or have backup copies...

Have you played any games recently? Like in the past 5-10y? What you're describing is already happening for quite a while now (even the streaming service death and f2p examples). It's called Software as a Service and the idea is that you don't own the software that you buy, but you temporarily license (borrow) its usage rights.

To me they are the party of the middle-upper class. For people who think of themselves as worldly educated professionals who went to a good university and are ""cultured"" to the point of thinking that identifying as European over British is the morally ascendent position. To them to call yourself British is to be small in scope and mentality, they sort of feel it represents an almost parochial backwardness.

They aren't the same as the Labour Corbynistas, much less ideologically charged, but there's an air of snobbery and arrogance to them that I cannot stand. They think they have everything figured out, that Brexit was a hoodwinking of the oh so dumb and racist British people by a cabal of wealthy Tory types. They claim to stand for liberty but in reality somewhat lament the fact that most of the electorate gets to vote instead of just them, because they think they know better on any given topic you could ask of.

They talk about loving what immigration does for the country but live in 95% white British commuter towns away from more migrant heavy areas. They are gleeful when they befriend a black person but can't figure out why their party is ""so white"" and tend to get rather upset about it (Vince Cable).

They are the sort to talk endlessly about supporting the working class but good Lord wouldn't ever have such people round for dinner. They'd think of them as uncouth, wouldn't like their jokes, wouldn't relate to the TV shows they watch. They holiday in France, never Spain.

Again, there is no uprising in the elections either. There is no right wing monopoly of the political space at any level. Different parts of Italy vote in different ways as they always have, the right gains or loses votes in different places and new movements emerge or old ones disappear. There are three major players in Italian politics right now and there is no sign of this changing any time soon. The majority of the voters aren't voting for the right wing and see no point in doing what the right wing wants to do.

It's not even about wahabbism death for blasphemy is enforced in Iran as well as Pakistan and none of those countries endorse wahabbism.

Erdogan can't go full islamist because the majority of Turkey's population is still secular and because Turkey is a constitutional republic and not a absolute monarchy like Saudi Arabia.

Well - it's due to difference in definition of ""liberalism"" in USA and Europe. European definition of liberalism is about economic freedom - free market, capitalism, lessiez-affair. That have nothing to do with overall worldview or morality. So then there are parties that are both conservative when comes to culture and society but in same time calls for free market. It may sound strange - but from European point of view Trump is liberal-conservative populist. US meaning of ""liberal"" is more akin to European ""social-democracy"" or overall left.

I think the talk about the education levels kicks in here too.

Most Brexiteer friends of mine fall into the older age group, have a preference of sharing posts with false information saying ""share if you agree"". This is among all the post from fake accounts offering the chance to win a holiday/car because someone was too young to claim etc (i.e. the scams).

2020,"&gt; Except there are no democratic socialisms/communisms. 

???

There is only one form of communism. The left doesn't fight over the definition of communism, which is a stateless, classless, and moneyless society, which is more democratic and free than a liberal democracy, but they fight over how to get there. And there very much are [democratic socialists.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism) Socialist parties in liberal democracies that don't advocate for an immediate end to capitalism are likely democratic socialists. Not to mention the socialist parties that peacefully gained power in countries like [Nepal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Nepal_(Maoist_Centre)) and [Greece.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriza)

&gt; When it comes to Sweden/Denmark, I like to count them as welfare capitalisms. 

At least this sentence is true. They are social democracies, which is different from democratic socialism.

&gt;  It has nothing to do with socialism in soviet bloc pre-1989.

Why does it have to? What happened under the Soviet Union wasn't the only form of trying to establish socialism/communism. You are actually the first person I have ever seen that tries to claim that.

It's impressive how you managed to put so many false claims into just 4 sentences.

&gt; Socialism and communism can't be democratic as their main idea is redistributing the wealth

This also happens under capitalism, except contrary to socialism, it's from the poor to the rich.

&gt; and seizing the means of production - which is not democratic at all.

How in god's name is it undemocratic when everybody has an equal say in their work/company? This is the same line of thinking absolute monarchies used back in the day. Because they held all the power and they ""rightfully"" got that power, it would be undemocratic to let the people vote because the monarchs would lose out.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/d41ukv/what_i_an_american_see_as_the_stereotypical/f07ebsl/,Zyvron,1568458846

&gt;Liberalism is a political and moral philosophy based on liberty, consent of the governed, and equality before the law. Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles, but they generally support limited government, individual rights (including civil rights and human rights), capitalism (free markets), democracy, secularism, gender equality, racial equality, internationalism, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.

Liberalism has historical and academic routes. It's a word that has a somewhat rigid meaning and you can't just call anything you want Liberalism and expect the rest of the world to agree with that.

&gt;Liberalism became a distinct movement in the Age of Enlightenment, when it became popular among Western philosophers and economists. Liberalism sought to replace the norms of hereditary privilege, state religion, absolute monarchy, the divine right of kings and traditional conservatism with representative democracy and the rule of law. Liberals also ended mercantilist policies, royal monopolies and other barriers to trade, instead promoting free markets. Philosopher John Locke is often credited with founding liberalism as a distinct tradition, based on the social contract, arguing that each man has a natural right to life, liberty and property and governments must not violate these rights.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/d41ukv/what_i_an_american_see_as_the_stereotypical/f07enqp/,Parastract,1568459113

2170,"It's  good that I have a bachelor in science. I was wrong. It is 0.8 degrees  increase since 1880, even less than I stated before. I know these  drought have an impact on certain areas, but you make it sound like they  just  appeared lately. In your article it says: ""The world‚Äôs earliest documented water war happened 4,500 years ago""..Yup.. the global warming was responsible for that. Where were the CO2 emissions? The cows of course farted out CH4, but you have no evidence to support how many cows there were to fart out methan fill up the atmosphere? 

If you knew something about law/wars, which I  personally do, then you will have a more clear understanding that the  problem is the ideology. I have had many friends who were muslims,  hundreds even, and it was there I realized they are here to change  Europe to a whole Muslim continent. First, they hate the west, even  though the west has saved them. They hate their free speech, their  drinking, democracy, everything. If I told you everything what the  Muslims told me, then I'm pretty sure your focus won't be the on dryness  of the Sahara desert and middle east..

Second,  you make it sound like if we stop all greenhouse gas emissions, it will  revert to it's original in a couple of years or decades and the problem is solved. It won't. It will take at least hundreds and even thousands of  years.

Third, I don't know if you  are including the forest in the ""global warming"" equation, but you can't  stop the trees and forest from being cut down, and they have exactly  the counter-effect of CO2. By taking them down, the speed of the  increasing CO2 concentration will be even faster than normal - and even  if the world stops the emissions, it will stay in the atmosphere for a  very long time since there aren't so many trees to absorb the CO2. You probably didn't know, but a lot of the CO2 will be dissolved into the oceans (and lakes), which will make it more acidic, hence disrupt the ecosystems down there.",,/r/europe/comments/d42e0u/join_the_movement/f073dt3/,Egzon2018,1568452013

Shapiro is a religious Jewish zealot who believes that Arabs ""like to bomb crap and live in open sewage"", a deeply bigoted transphobe, a believer in a ""militant homosexual agenda"" and a leftist subversion of universities. There was also that time when he compared PETA to the Nazis. He, in his constant criticism of ""feelings superceding facts"", is the ultimate feels-based tory. The axioms that his political views are grounded on are ultimately religious, nothing else than feelings. He is willing to hurt, denigrate and oppress fellow humans because he thinks that his almighty friend up in the sky wants him to. If god hated gay people so much, god would smite them himself. But no, he sends the 1.40 meters colossus Ben Shapiro to do it for him.

Peterson meanwhile is a con man. A respected psychologist, he reveals his deep political biases whenever he heads outside of that specific field of psychology. When talking about history, he implied that the Holocaust should have been a forced labor program as a rational measurement for the Nazis to win World War II, completely ignoring the forced labor that took place. In politics meanwhile, his main claim to fame was his completely ridiculous and misplaced commentary on the Canadian legislation bill C16, in which he strawmanned the fuck out of the bill's intended purpose because he had to fear that his feelings couldn't cope with not being allowed to intentionally misgender transgender people.

The line 'Europe's only indigenous people' is often used ([1](https://www.lapland.fi/visit/only-in-lapland/sami-europe-indigenous-people/), [2](https://mondediplo.com/2017/01/14saami), [3](https://slowtours.com/blog/travel-articles/meet-europes-only-indigenous-people-the-sami), [4](https://www.samediggi.fi/sami-info/?lang=en)) due to the Sami being the only [UN](https://www.unric.org/en/indigenous-people) recognised indigenous people in Europe. (I read that Greenland's Inuits are represented by Canada or Canadian Inuits at the UN, but for the life of me can't find that online article.)

[Here (on the box on the right)](https://www.unric.org/en/indigenous-people/27307-the-sami-of-northern-europe--one-people-four-countries) is the UN's understanding of the term 'indigenous':

&gt;‚Ä¢ ""Self-identification as indigenous peoples at the individual level and accepted by the community as their member;  
‚Ä¢ historical continuity with pre-colonial and/or pre-settler societies;  
‚Ä¢ strong link to territories and surrounding natural resources;  
‚Ä¢ distinct social, economic or political systems;  
‚Ä¢ distinct language, culture and beliefs;  
‚Ä¢ form non-dominant groups of society;  
‚Ä¢ resolve to maintain and reproduce their ancestral environments and systems as distinctive peoples and communities.""

2307,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes
His calculation was 99.86%accurate at that time! 

Eratosthenes made several important contributions to mathematics and science, and was a friend of Archimedes. Around 255 BC, he invented the armillary sphere. In On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies, Cleomedes credited him with having calculated the Earth's circumference around 240 BC, using knowledge of the angle of elevation of the Sun at noon on the summer solstice in Alexandria and on Elephantine Island near Syene (modern Aswan, Egypt).


Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's circumference without leaving Alexandria.[citation needed] He knew that at local noon on the summer solstice in Syene (modern Aswan, Egypt), the Sun was directly overhead. (Syene is at latitude 24¬∞05‚Ä≤ North, near to the Tropic of Cancer, which was 23¬∞42‚Ä≤ North in 100 BC.)[13] He knew this because the shadow of someone looking down a deep well at that time in Syene blocked the reflection of the Sun on the water. He then measured the Sun's angle of elevation at noon in Alexandria by using a vertical rod, known as a gnomon, and measuring the length of its shadow on the ground.[14] Using the length of the rod, and the length of the shadow, as the legs of a triangle, he calculated the angle of the Sun's rays.[15] This turned out to be about 7¬∞, or 1/50th the circumference of a circle. Taking the Earth as spherical, and knowing both the distance and direction of Syene, he concluded that the Earth's circumference was fifty times that distance.


In 2012, Anthony Abreu Mora repeated Eratosthenes's calculation with more accurate data; the result was 40,074 km (24,901 mi), which is 66 km (41 mi) different (0.16%) from the currently accepted polar circumference of the Earth.[15]",,/r/europe/comments/d40w4j/carl_sagan_explains_how_the_ancient_greek/f06gms4/,bebesiege,1568437427

2384,"I would guess 2045 the first serious talks are started. Right now the global economy is slowing, and if some people are correct, we are at the end of a Keynesian business cycle. Meaning after 2008, the recovery through quantitative easing in 2011-2015, the economy is slowing down again and soon there will be another recession. From an outsider's perspective, when the oil price crashed in 2016, it hit the Russian economy hard and eroded a lot of the good will that the younger and middle-aged population had in Putin/in the Russian governance. So with the next recession, this will increase more. Basically, every time the economy is slowing down, and this will happen reliably every 7-15 years, discontent into the general system will increase.

Add to that that there are many highly educated Russians living abroad, working and studying. No matter what the rethoric of Russia going their own way is, every day those people see that there is not much difference between EU &amp; Russia. When they come back, when their studies are over or the economy is going better, they will take that memory of how things could be with them.

Finally, many people vote Putin/are content because things are getting better in Russia slowly and are way better than in the 90s. Once the generation that is scared of the 90s is older and not politically active as much, there is space for a new attempt.

2417,"For those who don't speak Dutch, here's a translation of the article to English:

&gt;**The prosecutor's office in Brussels is investigating Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence Didier Reynders (MR). The Brussels prosecutor's office confirms this to De Tijd.**  
The investigation was started after a former secret agent of the State Security went to the federal judicial police in April with a series of allegations of corruption and money laundering against Reynders, who is a candidate for the position of European Commissioner for Justice. The allegations were also directed against a confidant of Reynders, who used to be an advisor in his cabinet. In his interrogation, the former secret agent refers to a series of public contracts and purchases, such as the construction of the Belgian embassy in Kinshasa, which, according to him, involved bribes.  
The prosecutor's office in Brussels does not want to say which investigative acts have been carried out in the past few months, but it does declare 'that the investigation is ongoing'.  
An information investigation means that the prosecutor's office is in charge of the investigation conducted by the police investigators. It is therefore not yet a 'judicial investigation' in which an investigating judge is in charge and can carry out far-reaching investigative acts, such as house searches. The prosecutor's office is now investigating whether there is sufficient evidence against Reynders in the allegations made by the former State Security officer. If that is the case, the case will move up the ladder to the Brussels prosecutor-general's office because Reynders is a minister. Ultimately, it is the prosecutor-general's office that will or will not appoint an investigating judge.  
The reaction of John Hendrickx, the spokesman for Reynders, is short: 'Perhaps this is yet another montage of the same evil man who tries to damage again and again.'  
**Accusations**  
At the beginning of this year, on Tuesday 2 April, a former State Security officer had walked into the federal police headquarters in the rue Royale de Bruxelles. The 54-year-old Nicolas Ullens de Schooten had worked for State Security for many years, from 1 March 2007 to 1 March 2018. He mainly worked in the economic section of the State Security, until it was closed down and he had to move to the radicalism section.  
That Tuesday, in the interrogation room, the former secret agent revealed to two federal judicial police investigators what he had heard about Deputy Prime Minister Didier Reynders (MR) during his years in the economic section of the State Security - and his numerous conversations with informants. His allegations were not insignificant: practices of corruption and money laundering. His accusations were also directed against a long-standing confidant of Reynders, who was also an advisor to his cabinet. That confidant would have helped Reynders with the alleged practices, claims the ex-secret agent.  
In the minutes of his interrogation we also read that the former secret agent testified about various government contracts and purchases which he claimed involved corrupt practices. He referred, for example, to the construction of the embassy in Kinshasa, which was inaugurated in 2017, and to the lease agreement for the federal police headquarters, which was inaugurated five years ago.  
The ex-secret agent also made statements, among other things, about bribes he believed to have been paid by arms dealers and by a Congolese election candidate seeking support from the Foreign Affairs Department. The agent always mentions the names of intermediaries and companies that, according to him, were involved in this.  
In the report of the interrogation, we also read about the methods which, according to the former secret agent, were used to receive bribes and to launder money. According to the man, this has happened in various ways. According to him, money was obtained and laundered by selling cheap antiques and art at high prices.  
The ex-secret agent refers in this connection to a Belgian antique dealer who is said to have close links with Reynders. The former secret agent claims that the antique dealer has already confessed against him that he has provided 'such services' to Reynders and his confidant. According to the ex-secret agent, the art and antiques trade was used to 'launder smaller sums of money (under 1 million euros)'.  
**Tax havens**  
Another money-laundering channel that the former agent believes he knows of was through the purchase and sale of real estate. Reynders' confidant would own a lot of homes in that respect, so much so that they could not be explained by his official income.  
Yet another channel is transactions via screen constructions in tax havens, according to the ex-secret agent. In his interrogation he mentions the name of a Dutchman who would help with the offshores. The former secret agent also refers to a top official who can tell the justice authorities more about this.  
Only the Brussels prosecutor's office and the police investigators can now determine what is really going on with the (detailed) statements of the ex-secret agent.  
De Tijd was however able to view five secret reports that the former secret agent drew up during his years at the State Security Service. These date back to the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. From these reports, taken from the database of the State Security, it appears that the man already drew up reports about the alleged corrupt practices during his work for the State Security.  
In the five secret State Security reports, a whole series of names were mentioned at the time. The alleged trick of laundering money through the purchase of art and antiques was also mentioned.  
**Prince Laurent**  
The five reports are confidential, official documents of the State Security. But they are not evidence. They contain 'raw information' that the State Security Service learnt through various informants. For example, one of the secret reports states that one of the informants was a high-ranking official in a relevant government department. As far as we could ascertain, State Security did not go to the justice authorities with the information at the time.  
The Brussels prosecutor's office only wants to officially confirm to De Tijd that 'an information investigation is in progress'. The prosecutor's office does not want to release which investigative acts the justice authorities have carried out in the past five months since the interrogation of the former secret agent. However, De Tijd learned that an attempt has already been made to interrogate Prince Laurent in this case because he had already made public reference in the press to corrupt practices in the Libya case that concerns him.

He has published more than a dozen books, like this one on the [History of Japan](https://www.amazon.es/Historia-Jap%C3%B3n-Econom%C3%ADa-pol%C3%ADtica-sociedad/dp/8490290296).

There Kamen is throwing a political tantrum like a 5-year old would do: ""I don't like how he thinks, so I insult him and lie about him"".

[https://emerging-europe.com/news/new-statistics-confirm-romanias-demographic-catastrophe/](https://emerging-europe.com/news/new-statistics-confirm-romanias-demographic-catastrophe/)

If we do the math, I am sure it ends up at over 20%. 

Spain and Italy combined have some 2 mil Romanians.

There's over half a million in Germany, half a million in the UK and another half in the US.

If you count another 200k for each of France, Canada, Brazil (huh ?) and Belgium\*, that's already 4.3 million.

There are easily over 200k in the rest of the world. So the total is well over 4.5 mil. 

Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian\_diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_diaspora)

Take into account the fact that not everybody is registered, so there's a 5-10% ""bonus"". And that the numbers for EU states increased after 2017. If the data in the table is pre 2017, it's very likely it's much higher today. Like the 200k for France or the 657k for Germany.

Numbers for Belgium say 65k, but they are from 2015. After Romania joined the EU, in 2017, the number of Romanians in Belgium exploded. Romanians are the 2nd largest minority in Brussels after the French and over the Moroccans. 

It sounds crazy, but it might be that the total reaches 5 mil.

But let's take 4.5 mil.

What's left in the country can't be more than 18 mil. Probably officially there are way more people, but I know people who have left 10+ years ago and they never bothered to inform the Romanian authorities. They registered in their new country and went on with their life.

So 4.5 out of 22.5 is a perfect 20%. 

If my suspicions are correct and the real population left in Romania is closer to 16 mil, about 22% of Romanians live abroad.

While the Zavala-Araiza (2015) paper states:

""Measured oil and gas methane emissions are 90% larger than estimates based on the US Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs Greenhouse Gas Inventory and correspond to 1.5% of natural gas production. This rate of methane loss increases the 20-y climate impacts of natural gas consumed in the region by roughly 50%.""

And the  Sanchez (2015) paper puts the threshold leakage where natural gas has no advantage over coal at 4% over a 20 year period. (See:  [https://imgur.com/a/o18nJI4](https://imgur.com/a/o18nJI4))

Ok so you're saying a UN report is trash worthy alright.

The orginal poster of the sources wasn't Kurdistan 24 btw either. They just reposted it.

https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/report-independent-international-commission-inquiry-syrian-arab-6 legitimate website, which deals with things like these, but oh well. I posted the k24 article because it is more recent. 

&gt;Human rights council of kurdistan wrote that report? 

Nope. The UN.

&gt;journalists in Afrin? That's because of people like you twist the shit out of truth and spread all kinds of bullshit

Or because they're trying to hide their warcrimes commited by their own proxies. You can't tell me that any Turkish source would be critical of Turkeys infiltration of Afrin. 

&gt;So Erdogan is opressing seculars in Turkey at the moment right? Are we running around and shooting people or are we waiting patiently untill he's gone?

Erdogan is putting everyone that steps out of line in behind bars. Even if he's gone at one point you can't tell me that shit like this is acceptabl. 


&gt;Why PKK had to act like caveman, and still is

 Because Turkey isn't giving the Kurds any human rights. 

&gt;offering the Kurds a political platform"" in the same sentence. They have 62 chairs in the parliament for fucks sake.

Doesn't mean much when the literal leader of the party (Demirta≈ü) is behind bars and most of the towns which had voted HDP mayors, had their mayors removed and replaced by AKP trustees. You can't really tell me that this is an equal and fair treatment. Removing all Pro-Kurdish politicans doesn't give the Kurds a fair and equal politcal platform. They even removed the mayor Diyarbakir!! I don't need to point out how important that city is for the Kurds.

&gt;Kurds might have opressed in the past, but not to the point of starting a terrorist organization against a fking country

You speak Kurdish, you got either jailed or shot. Imagine if I just came to your town, forbid your tongue, declared your culture as illegitimate and punished you for acting out of line. You greatly underestimate how brutal Turkey was in the 90ies. Does the phrase ""Mountains Turks"" ring any bells?

&gt;And now you're an existential threat to Turkeys sovereignty with your bullshit kurdistan idea, which you could do it without Turkish lands aswell, nobody stopping you. You punch someone bigger than you? Expect a bigger punch.

Alright, first of all. The PKK itself and most Kurdish politicans in Turkey have long abandoned the dream of carving out South East Turkey from Turkey, it ain't happening. Instead they want autonomy, or an absolute gurantee that the Kurdish culture isn't being trambled upon and that the Kurds aren't opressed anymore. The aim isn't to create an independent Kurdistan, but to liberate the Kurdish regions from all of this instable mess. That's where the problem lies, Turkey doesn't want to grant the Kurds equal rights, because they refuse to recognize the Kurdish identity. Aslong as that doesn't happen, you can kill as much terrorists as you want, the Kurds will be unhappy.",Kurdish,/r/europe/comments/d3t8gw/un_turkishbacked_forces_continue_to_commit_war/f05hb4s/,Crash995,1568409761

https://www.ecowatch.com/military-largest-polluter-2408760609.html

&gt;Last week, mainstream media outlets gave minimal attention to the news that the U.S. Naval station in Virginia Beach had spilled an estimated 94,000 gallons of jet fuel into a nearby waterway, less than a mile from the Atlantic Ocean.

&gt;While the incident was by no means as catastrophic as some other pipeline spills, it underscores an important yet little-known fact‚Äîthat the U.S. Department of Defense is both the nation's and the world's, largest polluter.

&gt;Producing more hazardous waste than the five largest U.S. chemical companies combined, the U.S. Department of Defense has left its toxic legacy throughout the world in the form of depleted uranium, oil, jet fuel, pesticides, defoliants like Agent Orange and lead, among others...

&gt;U.S. military bases, both domestic and foreign, consistently rank among some of the most polluted places in the world, as perchlorate and other components of jet and rocket fuel contaminate sources of drinking water, aquifers and soil...

&gt;In addition, the U.S., which has conducted more nuclear weapons tests than all other nations combined, is also responsible for the massive amount of radiation that continues to contaminate many islands in the Pacific Ocean. The Marshall Islands, where the U.S. dropped more than sixty nuclear weapons between 1946 and 1958, are a particularly notable example. Inhabitants of the Marshall Islands and nearby Guam continue to experience an exceedingly high rate of cancer...

&gt;One of the most recent testaments to the U.S. military's horrendous environmental record is Iraq. U.S. military action there has resulted in the desertification of 90 percent of Iraqi territory, crippling the country's agricultural industry and forcing it to import more than 80 percent of its food. The U.S.' use of depleted uranium in Iraq during the Gulf War also caused a massive environmental burden for Iraqis. In addition, the U.S. military's policy of using open-air burn pits to dispose of waste from the 2003 invasion has caused a surge in cancer among U.S. servicemen and Iraqi civilians alike.

&gt;While the U.S. military's past environmental record suggests that its current policies are not sustainable, this has by no means dissuaded the U.S. military from openly planning future contamination of the environment through misguided waste disposal efforts. Last November, the U.S. Navy announced its plan to release 20,000 tons of environmental ""stressors,"" including heavy metals and explosives, into the coastal waters of the U.S. Pacific Northwest over the course of this year.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/d3s47t/how_the_greenland_ice_melt_will_expose_buried_us/f04rtlk/,VoiceOfRaeson,1568394180

If the candidates do perform, we should reward them with progress, otherwise the EU's credibility is at stake since the Union had promised a European perspective to the region back in 2003. The more positive results we see in the region, just like in Norh Macedonia earlier this year, the more convincing arguments we can show to those opposing enlargement. Hence, I am optimistic that the EU can offer some positive signals to the region already at the European Council this October and then it will be up to the candidates to deliver more and convince the skeptics further with additional positive domestic action.¬†",Europe,/r/europe/comments/d3n78n/hi_reddit_i_am_vladimir_bilcik_an_mep_for_the_epp/f04t8tz/,VladBilcik,1568395087

/sarcasm off

Look at at federal map of German energy generation of the years. Number of renewables, location of nuclear plants so on. 

My Federal state was nearly completely run on nuclear during 2006 and now is primarily run on renewable Energy. Even replacing nearly half of little hard coal share we had, phasing those out by 2025.


NRW never really had nuclear and now doesn't really have renewable. (Like Saxony) So how would stopping the nuclear phase out would have stopped that? And no the Problem is not generating, but the Energy grid. That's most of the cost and the problem. Getting the clean Energy of the North to the Southern parts. The other Solutions is build renewable there, but as this would risk jobs, overall less in Germany than my renewable have in my federal State.( the job loss Argument is on whole new level of stupid).
And the other nimby problems.

So the Problem is more federal and more political and the nuclear Energy wouldn't have solve anything as most were to old anyway and had to be rebuild.

In 2017 a different person unrelated to the film revived the character, made a new costume, ans ran against Theresa May in the general election. He got very popular and started popping up all over the place.

This angered the original creator of the character, the American filmmaker who had made Hyperspace/Gremloids. He sent a cease and desist letter to Lord Buckethead 2 and threatened to sue him for copyright infringement. LB2 agreed to stop using the character

The planning offices are usually understaffed and overworked. They used to do roads, water and the like and now they suddenly have to oversee massive broadband projects. With not extra staff.

The consulting fees mentioned earlier are mostly spent, so the communities can even begin to request the funding from the state. The process is so convoluted and technical that basically noone except the specialist consulting companies can even apply for the money.

Society at large is nowhere near as hyped for broadband as you might think. Deploying fibre requires digging and digging requires consent of the land owner. Negotiating that is often time consuming and potentially ends up in courts. 

Last but not least, specialist companies for building an entire broadband network (from digging to digital access infrastructure) are fully booked and desperately searching for staff that doesn't exist. All they ever do is hiring staff from one another.

&gt;If the income share of the top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher GDP growth.

3275,"Another example of ""trickle down"" I guess. The average consumer cannot buy property anymore, and is forced to rent, trying to save what is left in the hopes of one day getting enough to, combined with a mortgage, get property.  


But investors have no such issues, current fiscal policy makes it even more interesting for them to take out loans (they have enough collateral to back them) and thus continue to buy even more property, driving up prices even further.  
Then they can raise the rent, and make it even more difficult for people like you and I to save money and get our own property.  


The end result will be a housing market fully controlled by ""the elite"", charging rent that makes it impossible for ""normal"" people to ever save enough to get property.  


Not to mention ""saving"" is also throwing away money due to the above monetary policy, and you have a catch 22.  
You don't have enough money to invest and turn a meaningful profit, you don't have enough to buy property and atleast have it go into something rather than throwing it in someone else's bank account, and the money you do have goes to investors renting out a place for you to live in.  


In concept its a great idea, making loans cheaper and punishing banks for ""parking"" their money. In practice the working class is taking the negative effects, and the ""elite"" that could already get loans anyway is getting more opportunities for personal enrichment.",,/r/europe/comments/d375we/ecb_cuts_key_rate_to_restart_bond_purchases/f03wvu0/,Flaksim,1568373210

For me, it shows the truth: this is how we live in everyday lives, we just don't see it as the infrastructure is in place to take waste away efficiently. What you see after a live gig is the truth, of course concentrated and exaggerated but still, it shows what a large group of people, seemingly no one litters and yet, they ground is full of it.

this is where your argument falls apart

Poland doesnt get any money for pipeline going through its soil, Poland gets enough money for pipeline maintenance, Poland is against NS 2 because it will escalated situation in Ukraine bringing conflict closer to its border, we know it will escalate situation because Russia is very open about intending to cut off ukraine from gas supplies once NS 2 is completed, this is why Russia wants to sign short term deal with ukraine after current one expires instead of long term one, they  need deal that only lasts until NS 2 is completed.

Stop accusing Poland of being greedy, its not Poland that is planning to sell out Ukraine to Russia for cheaper gas.",,/r/europe/comments/d3aeap/the_deputy_head_of_the_european_commission_nord/f03qaud/,Culaio,1568365755

3489,"&gt; The liquefied natural gas terminal Lithuania built five years ago to reduce its dependence on Russian fuel is about to get its first Siberian cargo.
&gt; 
&gt; The cargo will arrive at the facility, symbolically named Independence, next week on board the Stena Clear Sky, according to ship-tracking data on Bloomberg. That vessel loaded it at France‚Äôs Montoir terminal from another tanker that had in turn taken it from a Russian ship in Zeebrugge in Belgium.
&gt; 
&gt; The moves indicate the increasingly global nature of the LNG trade, when cargoes change hands, and vessels, several times. The final seller into Lithuania is unknown and may not be Novatek PJSC, the operator of the Siberian Yamal LNG project, which sells its cargoes to a variety of buyers.
&gt; 
&gt; Lithuania built the Independence floating LNG import terminal in 2014 to buy cargoes from global sellers such as Norway, Qatar and the U.S. to reduce its almost complete dependence on Russian pipeline fuel and as a bartering chip to secure better prices. U.S. President Donald Trump has been urging the Baltic states and Poland to stop importing gas through pipelines from Russia and instead turn to buying ‚Äúfreedom gas‚Äù from the U.S.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúIt is a bit ironic to now observe Lithuania‚Äôs FSRU ‚ÄòIndependence‚Äô, a symbolic name representing Lithuania‚Äôs independence from Russian gas, receiving a cargo originally sourced from Yamal,‚Äù Madeleine Overgaard, an LNG market analyst at Kpler, a data intelligence company, said by email. ‚ÄúIt reminds me of the Russian cargo arriving in the U.S. last year, whilst Trump was tweeting about the EU needing U.S.-sourced LNG to break free from pipeline gas from Russia.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; The first-ever Yamal LNG cargo was in January 2018 sent to a U.K. terminal and from there to Boston. While the molecules always mix via such transfers, at least some of that cargo originated at the Siberian plant.
&gt; 
&gt; Klaipeda LNG terminal confirmed that the Stena Clear Sky will arrive on Sept. 16 from Montoir, but declined to comment on the commercial aspects of the cargo.",,/r/europe/comments/d3lpr3/lng_hub_built_to_ease_energy_link_to_russia_gets/f03ljge/,Gril-Gril,1568359580

3500,"Not from Europe, came here from r/urbanplanning, but at least here in the U.S. median dwelling size has been consistently increasing over the past several decades. We went from having a mixture of small &amp; medium detached homes, apartments above commercial uses, etc. to a sea of large detached single-family homes (sadly, this is still the predominant development pattern in most metro areas).

Although there has been a recent push to re-invest in the city centers/urban neighborhoods, even those new developments' units are larger than they once were. As an example, a building that may have once been big enough for 24 units now only hosts 14 (not in every case, but in most).

3551,"&gt;&gt;Serbs Ignore EU Warning Over Plan to Join Russian-Led Trade Bloc
-

&gt;Serbia‚Äôs plan to join a Russian-led economic union is drawing ire from the European Union, which the Balkan nation says it wants to be part of.

&gt;The EU‚Äôs executive commission has made clear that Serbia will have to cancel any bilateral trade agreements with other countries if and when it joins the EU, and leaders said they‚Äôd rather see Belgrade aligning its policies more with the bloc‚Äôs. Serbian officials have ignored the criticism and will sign a deal to join the Eurasian Economic Union on Oct. 25. The Russian-led bloc also includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.

&gt;The plan is ‚Äúnot a hindrance to European integration,‚Äù Serbian Trade Minister Rasim Ljajic said by email last week. The European Commission‚Äôs warning isn‚Äôt going to ‚Äúaffect Serbia‚Äôs decision to enter into this agreement in Moscow,‚Äù he said.

&gt;The EU has no say over which groups Serbia joins while it‚Äôs not a member, but some of its representatives indicated they would like to see greater commitment to membership, especially after an EU progress report earlier this year showed that Serbia was only partially aligning its foreign and security policies with the EU‚Äôs.

&gt;Serb leaders have said that EU membership is a priority, a goal they hope to achieve around the middle of next decade. At the same time, Serbia has historic and religious ties with Russia, which is helping it prevent the further recognition of Kosovo in international bodies. Additionally, Russia has donated fighter jets and tanks to Serbia and Serb leaders, including President Aleksandar Vucic, are frequent visitors to Moscow.

&gt;&gt;**‚ÄòEuropean Orientation‚Äô**

&gt;‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be marching in several directions at the same time,‚Äù Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak, who spent years working in the Balkans, said last month in Helsinki. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre serious about your European orientation then obviously you make political decisions that bring you closer to it. This is not one of them.‚Äù

&gt;The Eurasian Economic Union, established by Russian President Vladimir Putin to create a rival to the EU‚Äôs open market and help rebuild Moscow‚Äôs sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union, has four other members aside from Russia.

&gt;Economists in Belgrade have also questioned the benefit of the trade membership for Serbia, whose main export markets are in western Europe, not in the east.

&gt;‚ÄúRussia accounts for only one quarter of what we export to Germany and Italy,‚Äù said Ivan Nikolic, an economist and member of central bank‚Äôs advisory council. ‚ÄúWe are accessing a new market but the question is what we can offer. We are exporting food products, and fruit and vegetables, but we are not price competitive.‚Äù",Romania,/r/europe/comments/d3kopq/serbs_ignore_eu_warning_over_plan_to_join/f03drth/,Ebadd,1568352923

The real problem is that CCleaner's registry cleaner can break a lot of things in your OS and it can be dangerous to use it. It is a good idea in general not to touch registry entries at all unless you are sure what exactly the specific ones do. And things like cleaning your cache are pointless.

Also, after they were bought by Avast (which is a pretty shady company), they made it impossible to turn of its system tracking.

If you are on Windows, don't use CCleaner or even any third-party antivirus software.

3580,"&gt;Would have been a splendid compliment to clean energy as it has been developing.

No it wouldn't, nuclear and renewable energy both aren't able to supply on demand energy, they take up the same space in our electric needs

Renewable for obvious reasons, and nuclear because of economic reasons:

It never makes sense to throttle a nuclear power plant down, as you don't save any money with it. (the fuel is so cheap, it's basically free) Meanwhile if you reduce the output you have less energy units to sell where you can offset the fixed costs (construction, decomissioning, etc), thus those units of energy you still sell, have to cost more.

This only changes if we can store the energy somehow for cheap, and batteries are ok for short term, daily charge discharge, but get stupidly expensive for longer term storage. So the long term, my best bet would be hydrogen and maybe even natural gas, but we waste 50% of the energy just by going electricity to hydrogen to electricity again.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/d3e21u/daily_share_of_britains_power_generated_by/f03fc5o/,Alcobob,1568354126

If what you're saying is true, then I think eventually the 'walkable cities' movement might reach the States, but I think it will be limited compared to Europe. For better or worse, the way the country has developed has basically made a car required in a lot of places to live.

There was a documentary a while called 'The End of Suburbia' which predicted that eventually we would be forced to move to a less car-centric lifestyle because of things like rising of oil prices, which would make the price of gas extremely high and make long commutes unsustainable.

Problem is, that hasn't happened all. In fact, the U.S. is producing more oil than ever, thanks to things like fracking. And with the rise of electric cars, oil won't even be necessary for cars to run in the future.

Both are examples of ""personal liberties"" that are stripped away to ensure everyone's well-being; be it immunity to preventable diseases, a reduction in unsafe sex practices and their consequences (unwanted pregnancies, STIs), or (hopefully) a greater tolerance and understanding of women and LGBTQIAP+ people.

While some people would be angry over their children learning at school that gay people are normal, or that women menstruate (and masturbate!), or how to put on a condom, the benefits to society as a whole outweigh the losses some individuals may incur. Schools should not give moral guidance in this aspect, they should only provide facts. The parents can still tell their children whatever they want about sex. If their religion/moral system forbids premarital sex, so be it. If they believe gay people should be marginalized and shamed back into the closet, then okay! No one is stopping parents from raising their children in accordance with these values. Just let them know who or what are they opposed to.

Actually it's the image they used when covering the event yesterday, as seen [here](https://twitter.com/elmundoes/status/1171819868418641920). At El Mundo website main page yesterday, they only showed that image. There was a clear intention there.

&gt; Purposefully picking two newspapers known to be very biased, ABC and La Raz√≥n. El Mundo is not as biased, so OP is misrepresenting their report to support their point.

ABC, La Raz√≥n and El Mundo are obviously biased. The first 2 are known to be Spanish nationalist, conservative and monarchical. 

But it's not like OP picked fringe Spanish nationalist newspapers/sites like La Gaceta, 13tv, LibertadDigital, MediterraneoDigital and so on. He picked some of the most important newspapers in Spain, that most Spaniards choose to be informed.

El Pa√≠s is the only one of the main newspapers that didn't manipulate the images, indeed.

&gt; But of course, putting El Pa√≠s in OP's picture does not make for a nice conspiracy story.

He could have included El Pa√≠s, since this time it seemed pretty neutral.

Sorry bud. Self-driving vehicles are expected to make congestion worse, not better. As self-driving cars become more prevalent, congestion will lower at first, but eventually that extra space will be filled up with more cars and congestion will return. It's the law of induced demand and it's also the reason why adding more lanes to a highway on a congested highway only solves congestion for a little while then it returns and even becomes worse.    

Nothing will ever 'solve' cars.

3941,"&gt; Catalonia has higher income, more development and urbanization. We get more because of the solidarity principle of every single state in which the wealthy give to the poor, as it's done in Spain, the US or the EU (not a state but also applies to us).

Ok, you clearly don't seem to understand how this works.

The principle of solidarity means that the wealthy regions give more money to the poorer ones. This is what happens in every country in the world, and it's completely fine. Same in the EU, Germany contributes more than Romania for instance. But this is NOT the case of Spain.

In Spain the current system means that the wealthy regions, like Catalonia, after the redistribution, they end up becoming poorer than the originally poorer ones. And the poorer ones richer than the poorer ones. And that's what makes it unfair, because it infringes the [ordinality principle](https://elpais.com/ccaa/2015/12/15/catalunya/1450208256_364728.html).

&gt; https://www.elconfidencial.com/economia/2017-06-06/financiacion-autonomica-expertos-iva-especiales-corresponsabilidad-ordinalidad-solidaridad-cataluna_1394433/

&gt; El principio de ordinalidad es, precisamente, una de las cuestiones que m√°s preocupan a algunos territorios que aportan m√°s de lo que reciben, como Catalu√±a, Comunidad Valenciana o Baleares, que no cuestionan la existencia de la solidaridad interregional, sino que haya tanta discrepancia entre lo aportado y los recursos finalmente disponibles.

This is not some crazy thing said by Valencians or Catalans. All the political parties agree this is totally unfair, because it means that Catalans or Valencians have less money and worse public services than regions like Extremadura. Despite being originally ""richer"". The Spanish government itself has acknowledged the lack of investment in Catalonia.

Hopefully with this example you will understand it:

1. Money generated in a year per region (taxes on IRPF, economical activity, etc):

- Catalonia: 3,000

- Extremadura: 500

- Castile: 1,000

According to this, Catalonia is richer than Extremadura. But none of this money stays in the regions, because all of it is sent to Madrid to be redistributed (4,500 total):

2. Redistributing money to regions. Each region gets this money that same year to spend on its region:

- Catalonia: 1,000

- Extremadura: 1,500

- Castile: 2,000


So, Extremadura and Castile have more money than Catalonia. The originally poorer have now become richer than the poorer ones. This is why Catalonia has some of the worst public systems in Spain.

This is a simplification of how the current system works. In all the previous links I sent you you have more detailed info and graphs, specially [here](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20170713/catalunya-tercera-comunidad-en-aportar-y-decima-en-el-reparto-de-inversiones-6165691). Imagine if this happened in the EU for isntance, with Romania having more money in their public budget than Germany, after redistribution. It would be unacceptably unfair.

&gt; I'll just leave 2 headlines here. Imagine the outrage if this were to happen in Catalonia

Except all of this already happens in Catalonia, and constantly. Literally 2 days ago: [250 trains cancelled in one day](https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/3757873/0/retrasos-rodalies-barcelona-hospiatlet-sants-cercanias/]. Yesterday [More than a million passengers in Catalonia affected by the failures in trains](https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/catalunya/20190912/47305307953/rodalies-averias-senalizacion-retrasos-pasajeros-incidencias-renfe-adif.html). It's a constant thing.

I'm going to assume that you didn't know anything about this, because the train situation is terrible in Catalonia. And Catalonia receives less money per inhabitant than Asturias, which means Asturias has it better to solve it.

I hope you no longer believe that Catalonia is a rich land where everything works perfectly, because it's actually the opposite. And understand why the Catalan economical claims are legitimate, as are those of the other regions who also suffer it, like Valencia.

F-22 is a different airplane altogether. Its a pure air superiority fighter. And, much more stealthy than an F-35.

US doctrine is that, once you have air superiority, you can fly 60 year old B-52s. The F-22 takes out the opposing aircraft, and the F-35 takes out the anti-aircraft batteries.

F-35 had some teething problems, but seems to be doing quite well now. Things get fixed very quickly once a weapon is in combat.

4007,"&gt; They do that everywhere in the world, I don't see what this has to do with Dutch cycling?
&gt; 
&gt; 

Making it harder to drive by car makes it harder for families to live. City centers around the world are typically harder to travel in by car than suburbs. The reason is not always Dutch bikes, I have never claimed that - I claimed that excessive bike infrastructure / closing off streets makes it more difficult. City centers can also be more difficult for cars because of narrow streets, limited parking, traffic jams and other factors unrelated to bikes. People may also move from city centers for reasons unrelated to cars. None of this disproves the theory people are moving from city centers because of excessive bike infrastructure at the expense of cars. I am not claiming people are only moving from city centers because of excessive bike infrastructure.

Simple enough? 

&gt; You've been shown that 2/3rds of Dutch children bike to school. How exactly is that not enjoying getting around by bike?

The stat on the website was not cycling but cycling or walking. Anyway, I do not see the relevance of this stat. In the US children take a bus, this does not mean that bus is a feasible form of transport for most things a family does. The kids can cycle a preset route (which is typically short) to the school. They cannot cycle to visit relatives, they cannot cycle to their hobbies with lots of gear, they cannot cycle to the supermarket to do the weekly shopping. 

Not to mention that cycling stats overwhelmingly include older children or that it is completely inapplicable to societies where you would be considered a freak for letting your kid go to school alone (e.g. Britain, the US).

&gt; But for some reason, in The Netherlands SURELY the bikes are to blame for this global trend. Why?

As I said in the beginning and have been very clear throughout, it's about all policies that make driving more difficult - just a lot of these are being driven by the cyclenazis these days in Europe.

The cash flow from the existing bonds does not change, however, their current value is higher because the alternative (buying new bonds) provides smaller cash flow. Only the (future) tax payer profits here.

Then why is it financed by several EU countries and approved by the EU parliament?

&gt; She added that ""there is a need for gas infrastructure in Europe"", but the construction of another gas pipeline next to Nord Stream 1 ""makes no sense"".

It's about connecting the EU directly to Russia. Where else would you put it avoiding third party countries that could use the transit as leverage?

&gt; Vestager recalled that Nord Stream 1 had already tried to increase its benefits by making the onshore branch of Nord Stream - the Opal pipeline - available to gas suppliers other than Gazprom.

And what's so bad about that? Opening up the pipeline to other suppliers makes the EU more independent.

&gt; The pipe will increase the supply of Russian gas to Germany by 55 billion cubic metres per year.

To the entire EU, not just Germany. That's why Nordstream 2 connects to EUGAL. Which will connect to pipelines in Poland and Czechia and and subsequent eastern and southern countries. And then there's also NEL which connects western countries.

&gt; The Nord Stream 2 consortium is headed by the Russian Gazprom Group, which is half-funding a ‚Ç¨9.5 billion project. German companies Uniper and Wintershall are involved in the construction.

Also, some countries restrict gambling even harder, e.g. 21+ or completely illegal.

The real issue is that such a system could be used for other things as well, like unjustified censoring or in the service of some stupid moralistic crusade.

I have a license but I don't have a car. When I was still living with my parents in a suburb we used to do weekly shopping runs to a hypermarket but after I moved away (first to Budapest, then to Maastricht, and now to Rotterdam) I switched to doing smaller doses 2-3 times a week. I usually walk to the stores because Dutch cities are zoned sensibly (no food deserts) and even in Budapest you can usually find some sort of a supermarket within 10 minutes of walking distance, but even when I bike to the store the groceries rarely fill one of my panniers, let alone both. And if they did, I could still put a crate on my rack on top of them.

And as an additional reward, I get fresher food. No more frozen stuff (if only because my freezer space was small to nonexistent; now I have somewhat more space but I rarely ever use them fully) and I don't have to plan dinners #5 and #6 after a shopping to use non-perishables only (mostly because dinners #5 and #6 after any given shopping are only dinners #2 and #3 after the next shopping).

I know that Limburg is quite different from the rest of the country. The population density is lower, and it's a catholic region so many shops are closed on Sunday. (When the Jumbo closest to my place decided to open on Sundays, it was advertised as some kind of a big deal.)

1. L√©rida and Gerona are the correct way of referring to Lleyda and Girona in Spanish. Confirmed by the RAE. Nothing to do with nationalism.

2. All of my Catalonian friends say that they would push for Tabarnia if independence ever becomes a possibility. That currently, they see it as a joke an a way of annoying the pro independence movement, but they admit that in case of an actual referendum they would like to not be forced to accept independence just because the payeses vote in favour of it. It seems to me that you are disregarding the possibility based on your own echo chamber. A lot of people in Catalonia would prefer an Spanish Barcelona than a independent Catalonia.

You are also ignoring the fact that in order to lhave a referendum, you would need some kind of agreement with Spain, which means that even if Catalans do not want Tabarnia, they may find themselves force to apply a Canadian type of referendum.

Have you seen how many PiS politicians have a communist past? I strongly recommend that you look that up.

&gt; but the calling the party itself ""post-commies"" is as far from the truth as calling German SPD ""post-nazis"" would be

So it would be equally accurate as calling SLD or KE post-commies. None of those *parties* is communist in any way nowadays. You will find some *people* with vaguely communist past or views, but neither of them attempted to implement any form of communism during they rule, none of them approached it and none of them even has any plans to do so. Neither does Lewica.

&gt; And I would prefer it becoming more capitalist, not less

Trees, especially conifers, generally live in more acidic environments, and the needle litter they produce further acidifies the nearby topsoil. Low pH is often a metabolic signal for trees at the seed/seedling stages.

I'm much less of an agricultural expert, but IIRC many grass crops (e.g. grains) are sensitive to K/Ca deficiency and require this in the topsoil, but only in moderate quantities. In contrast, both vegetable and cereal crops require large amounts of N and P to reach max size, but they suck it out of the soil so farmers usually give high-N and high-P fertilizers to areas where these are grown.",kanadensare i sverige,/r/europe/comments/d35puz/soils_of_europe_a_new_set_of_maps_by_the_european/ezzgiwp/,Zaungast,1568286564

4485,"It shouldn't be a surprise that many Americans support their foreign policy when they are deceived on so many levels. History, diplomacy, security are areas in which you misunderstand the fundamentals.

&gt;Pearl Harbor
&gt;Do you not realize Castro‚Äôs stance against the US?

Pearl harbour had disproportionate consequences compared to starting a nuclear war because of a bad assumption. Was the attack from Soviets really to suspect? No. Soviet decision to place missiles on Cuba was to balance the US missiles in Turkey, which btw also weren't used in an attack on SU. Cuba's intentions were even more obvious because a year before US executed a failed invasion. You have to make some serious mental gymnastics to assume Cubans had offensive intentions.

&gt;The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki effectively ended WWII

No it didn't. Japanese leadership under Tojo was willing to die so they surely wouldn't be scared of anything the US would bring. Their cities were already firebombed regularly so an atom bomb would not be so much different. Just because Americans were impressed by it doesn't mean that the Japanese were. Total failure in empathy. They surrendered because the SU, for which the Japanese hoped to be the mediator for potential peace talks, declared war on Japan.

&gt;Do you not realize Pearl Harbor was an act of war?

War had and has some strict rules fyi. Only military targets are allowed and Nagasaki certainly wasn't one. Only a coward or a sadist does that.

&gt;Did you forget the money and resources the US gave Japan to help it get back on its feet?

I was talking about Russia. But since we're here let me enlighten you. Although Japan was not a beneficiary of the Marshall plan they did receive aid. This was however merely to sustained the society of which economy was disfunctional. US occupational policies under MacArthur and Dodge were a failure. Recovery started when the Japanese took control of their economy. Ministry of international trade and industry played crucial role in controlling trade exchange and financing. The only benefits the Japanese had from the US was that they allowed them favorable trading conditions and the advice on o e occasion from the guest lecturers on modern industry. Was this all a nice gesture? Yes it was, but stick to the facts, post war Japan was not American creation.

&gt;whatever that means to you good for you lol.

What idiot creates a condition in which he endangers the existence of entire human race? Ylu are proud of killing women and children? Why do Americans complain over 9/11? Where is your integrity?

4571,"Depends on the time that is looked upon. When the imperial title was transferred to Charlemagne, the prestige and legitimacy was at its peak. Charlemagne had basically united all of (catholic) christendom into his empire. The title of emperorship then went through multiple stages, sometimes associated with more centralized power other time without real control on the Empire. In the meantime, christian kingdom outside of the Empire became stronger (Castile/Aragon/England/France/Poland). Since these were still only kingdoms, they still had less prestige than the Empire. 

I could talk on a lot more, but the history of the Empire is incredibly complex and 1000 years long. Many things happened in parallel (e.g. the Reformation) which impacted the Empire and the title of Emperor a lot over time.

In general, one can say that from today's perspective the Emperor might now have had a lot of power or prestige. For the people actually living during these times, this was strikingly different. They were much more religious (the Emperor was also a religious leader!) and saw the emperorship in the context of antiquity, the Roman empire and the natural order of how society should look like.",,/r/europe/comments/d2r9ff/italian_peninsula_17131748/ezz368m/,rubber_duckzilla,1568279649

2. Free Action: The government has no right to regulate one's actions unless they affect a non-consenting third party. Climate regulation is acceptable, worker safety isn't. 
3. Freely form contract: Ties in with the last one. Anything that you and I agree to in contract may not be infringed upon unless our contract somehow infringes upon the same rights of someone else.
4. I hope I don't have to explain how the EU infringes upon property rights.

&gt; The Dutch approach to sex ed has garnered international attention, largely because the Netherlands boasts some of the best outcomes when it comes to teen sexual health. On average, teens in the Netherlands do not have sex at an earlier age¬†[than those in other European countries¬†](http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/163857/Social-determinants-of-health-and-well-being-among-young-people.pdf)or in the¬†[United States](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_031.pdf). Researchers found that among 12 to 25 year olds in the Netherlands, most¬†[say they had ¬†‚Äúwanted and fun‚Äù first sexual experiences](http://www.whijournal.com/article/S1049-3867%2811%2900008-9/abstract). By comparison,¬†[66 percent of sexually active American teens surveyed said they wished that they had waited longer to have sex for the first time](https://thenationalcampaign.org/sites/default/files/resource-primary-download/wov_2004.pdf). When they do have sex, a Rutgers WPF study¬†[found that¬†](http://www.rutgers.nl/sites/rutgersnl/files/PDF-Onderzoek/Factsheet_Seksonderje25ste_ENG.pdf)nine out of ten Dutch adolescents used contraceptives the first time, and ¬†[World Health Organization data shows¬†](http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/child-and-adolescent-health/adolescent-health/health-behaviour-in-school-aged-children-hbsc2.-who-collaborative-cross-national-study-of-children-aged-1115)that Dutch teens are among the top users of the birth control pill. According to the World Bank, the teen pregnancy rate in the Netherlands is¬†[one of the lowest in the world,](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.ADO.TFRT)¬†five times lower than the U.S. Rates of HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases are also low.

The reasons PiS does not actually want to destroy the LGBT community by making Russian-style restrictions on personal freedom are:
* They need an ""enemy"" as a scarecrow for the masses to mobilize their voters.
* As mentioned by /u/bm52oc, the EU would not forgive them this, and they would lose a lot of support from moderates whose stance on LGBT issues is ""let them do anything they want in the privacy of their bedrooms, but publicly displaying your orientation is weird"".

And that's why they assume a passive-aggressive stance but only ""pray"" for the ""good"" of LGBT people (and convince everyone else that they are not normal), rather than actively repress them.

The UK can also not hinder the political reform process in the EU because of the conditions they agreed to to get the first extension in March 2019, and they know it. And there's not real downsides either, both politically because nobody outside the UK really cares how chaotic they are, and economically because everybody gets more time to prepare and further strengthen trade relations that work around the UK. And above all that, we keep the (slightly small) chance alive that things will still work out somehow. So following this strategy provides minimal risk and lots of reward, I don't get why it would be worth to sacrifice all that just to obtain a nebulous ""certainty"" or, even worse, a pouty ""now they see what it got them for being so mean"".

Law and Justice Party

Poland‚Äôs parliament suspended until after next month‚Äôs election

Opposition accuses ruling Law and Justice party of 'hidden plan' following unexpected move
   
September 11, 2019 2:34 pm by James Shotter in Warsaw

Poland‚Äôs ruling Law and Justice party has unexpectedly asked for parliament to be suspended until after a general election on October 13, sparking claims by the opposition that it is planning to delay unpopular bills until after the vote.

Parliament ‚Äî where Law and Justice has a majority ‚Äî was due to hold its final session from today until Friday. However, after today‚Äôs session has finished, parliamentary business will be suspended until after the poll. The outgoing parliament will then reconvene for two days to finish the session.

Announcing the unprecedented move ‚Äî which has echoes of the tussle in the UK over the prorogation of parliament ‚Äî the speaker, Elzbieta Witek, said it was meant to allow MPs to focus on campaigning, and insisted that no new bills would be added to the agenda after the election.

‚ÄúWe have not broken the rules, everything is in accordance with the rules,‚Äù she said, adding that Law and Justice had not provided a justification for its request. ‚ÄúThis is not a new sitting of the Sejm. It is the same sitting that has [already] been planned.‚Äù

However, opposition politicians were quick to voice suspicions that the move was meant to let Law and Justice ram through bills at the last minute if next month‚Äôs poll ‚Äî which Law and Justice is expected to win comfortably ‚Äî did not go as forecast.

‚ÄúLaw and Justice has some sort of hidden plan. Either they do not believe that the result of the election will be positive for them, and they want to cover themselves. Or they want to prepare some law that could not be passed in normal circumstances,‚Äù Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska, who was unveiled last week as the prime ministerial candidate of Civic Coalition, the largest opposition grouping, told TOK FM radio.

‚ÄúIt does not bode well. And I do not believe Ms Witek‚Äôs claim that this is only being done for the benefit of MPs: you do not do things like this just out of love for politicians.‚Äù

Opinion polls suggest that the nationalist conservative Law and Justice ‚Äî which has been accused by Brussels of undermining the rule of law, but won over many voters with generous welfare spending ‚Äî is on course for a convincing victory next month.

A recent aggregation of polls by Ben Stanley, assistant professor at the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Warsaw, put Law and Justice on 46 per cent; the centre right Civic Coalition on 29 per cent; and a leftwing coalition on 13 per cent.

Nonetheless, Ms Kidawa-Blonska‚Äôs suspicions were echoed by other opposition figures, including the leader of the agrarian PSL party, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, and Borys Budka from Civic Coalition, who speculated whether Law and Justice could use the extra session to amend the budget proposal it put forward last month.

‚ÄúAre [Law and Justice] so afraid of what the verdict will be on October 13 that [they] are going to change the budget on October 15, perhaps by dropping all [their] promises which cannot be fulfilled?‚Äù Mr Budka asked.",,/r/europe/comments/d2xvxd/polands_parliament_suspended_until_after_next/ezy5gmg/,accidentallandlorduk,1568258328

Lydians lived in Anatolia before the Greeks. And like how Europeans migrated from Eurasia (modern day Russia and Turkey) to Europe. The Lydians also moved out of Anatolia to Italy, Tuscany.

FYI Turks aren't the only people who migrated from Asia to Europe. But they were probably one of the last ones to make such a big migration. (Look up Indo-European migrations and the Anatolian hypothesis)

The remaining Lydians in Anatolia became slaves of colonizing Greeks, got raped or got Greekified by force. Before the Turks or even the Greeks arrived in Anatolia, the region was colonized many times.

Besides that the Laz who are also one of the ancient inhabitants of the region are still living in Anatolia. And unlike what the Greeks claim, the Pontic Greeks were genetically not Greek. They are genetically closer to people from the region who were Greekified. Just like the ""Anatolian"" Greeks.

Even the Cypriot Greeks are genetically closer to the Levant than to Greece.

&gt; you have to speak to Catalan to be a civil servant and do well in Catalonia

Only civil servants working for the Government of Catalonia fulfill that! Hence the good thing of having more autonomy, because in all areas where Catalonia has devolved powers all public servants speak Catalan and Spanish perfectly. Thus fulfilling the right of citizens to be attended in Catalan.

However, that's not the case of the civil servants working for the Government of Spain that are deployed in Catalonia. According to the law, they should indeed know Catalan to be civil servants working in Catalonia. But they simple ignore for most of the cases. His examples are completely in point because I think that we all Catalans have experienced them.

In post offices (Correos, owned by Spanish government), I barely never I'm attended in Catalan in Barcelona, despite I speak to them in Catalan. Not a single word in Catalan.

Courts are also a famous example, since most of the judges working in Catalonia are not required to know Catalan (Spanish justice system is centralized), despite the fact the law explicitly states that citizens have the right to have trials in Catalan in Catalonia. There's plenty of cases where judges ignore it, and force Spanish only to citizens: [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYxqv2W5HCI) and [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8qe8jcxNSM).

5020,"&gt; Catalonia isn't a nation though for a start and never has been.

Even the [Spanish government disagrees with you](https://twitter.com/bbchardtalk/status/1039534160224903168). How some of you still dispute that Catalonia is a nation? Spain is a country made up of different historical nations.

&gt; Catalonia already has autonomy

Sure, I mean every country, region or territory in the world have (some degree of) autonomy. Toscana and Tibet have autonomy. What Catalans have always demanded is more autonomy, since we currently don't have the autonomy that we want. The absolute majority of Catalans demand more autonomy. And in some areas, Spain is still very centralized (like in infrastructures, which is one of the most centralized in Europe).

One example: euthanasia. In Catalonia there's a clear majority of people who want to decriminalize it, so those experiencing serious physical or psychological suffering due to an incurable illness can stop suffering. In July 2017, [Catalan parliament approved to decriminalize it](http://www.catalannews.com/society-science/item/catalan-parliament-takes-first-step-towards-euthanasia-law), but we don't have the competences to do so (not a devolved power), so this 2017 had to be sent to Spanish Parliament. Where it was subsequently ignored. It's been 2 years already and nothing has happened. If we had more autonomy, this issue would have already been solved in Catalonia. And all those Catalans that need it could have already made use of it. That's why autonomy is important.

Here you have a more detailed list of examples: [List of Constitutional Court of Spain rulings against Catalan Parliament Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Constitutional_Court_of_Spain_rulings_against_Catalan_Parliament_Laws). In all those cases, the Spanish Constitutional Court considered that Catalonia didn't have the competences to approve these laws. Related with housing, climate change, and other laws passed to improve the lives of Catalans. Now those powers belong to the central State, which doesn't exert them.

Language and culture are also very important areas. Since Spain has not really played much attention on this, except on Spanish language and culture, specially when Spanish nationalists govern. Which is why most of the judges in Catalonia can't understand Catalan, meaning people have serious problems when using Catalan in Catalan courts. If Catalonia had more autonomy, Catalan language would have more protection, since right now the ""right to be attended in Catalan"" is infringed on a daily basis by Spanish officials working in Catalonia.

&gt;  It sounds like this is less about language, or culture and more about Catalonia wanting to keep more money for themselves that they don't need as much as other Spanish regions.

Guess what, the Aran Valley has the highest GDP per capita of all the 42 regions of Catalonia. Therefore, they are a rich region. I guess we should't have gave them autonomy, nor recognizing their language, since they are richer. I'm sure they would have like that.

Some of you talk as if this is was all about money. And as if we were some rich dudes. When all of this is far from the reality.",Catalonia,/r/europe/comments/d2tt9z/hundreds_of_thousands_of_catalans_take_the/ezxld82/,JosepFontana,1568243331

5050,"&gt;What exactly is the Serbian game plan though?

The current game plan of Kosovo is ""recognize us as a country"" and that's it. Many agreements have not been honored, or there were half-assed. Currently the official position of Kosovo's government is to retain massive import taxes on goods from Serbia until Serbia recognizes Kosovo.

Serbia, in this case, has nothing else to lose. EU membership is far, far away due to recent developments (migrants, Brexit, etc.), some extra investments came in from China, and the region is relatively peaceful. It's still shit, no ifs or buts about it, but I doubt there's much Serbia can really lose in this.

Kosovo also does its best to gain new recognitions, enter various international orgs, lobbies left and right, and I guess it's also within Serbia's right to fight against that, no matter what I think about that turd Dacic. I'd rather focus our efforts elsewhere, but eh...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The more common sense approach would be to do some sort of land swap between Serbia and Kosovo. 

This was hinted at. The US is like ""we don't care, as long as you strike a deal"". The EU is mixed, with Germany being very much against it (due to Republika Srpska and whatnot). Both Serbia and Kosovo had ideas, but apparently when they hinted at a possible land swap, polls suggested that there was not enough momentum and the idea was dropped. Nowadays, both Vucic and Haradinaj deny that any such ideas have ever been considered.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/d2x0mu/czech_president_tells_serbia_he_will_seek_to/ezxm5f6/,bureX,1568243899

5052,"To correct myself (whoops), we have technically signed but never ratified so it‚Äôs not actually binding on us up until the point we do. If that ever happens, US presidents and officials have been trying for a while but a good number of politicians, particularly some Republicans aren‚Äôt eager to go for it.

As to why they aren‚Äôt, it‚Äôs not really a matter of territorial dispute but other factors. For one, if you accept UNCLOS sea bed mining becomes something that you‚Äôre only supposed to do with the approval of the International Seabed Authority, and they are to be paid royalties. Some share of these royalties are supposed to go towards developing landlocked countries. So as those Republicans view this as ceding US authority to an international bureaucracy and permitting them to take money from our companies for wealth redistribution, they are not fans of it even though some among their number such as President George W. Bush pushed for it. Also there are some provisions for technology transfer being a condition of granting mining rights on sea beds and that‚Äôs another thing that doesn‚Äôt look so great.

5128,"&gt;A group of hooded young people has burned an image of King Philip VI and another of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, during the demonstration of the pro-independence left in Barcelona on the occasion of the Diada.

&gt;The episode took place in the Passeig Llu√≠s Companys in front of the S√≠ndic de Greuges headquarters, where five anti-system demonstrators with their faces covered have displayed two large-size images of the faces of Felipe VI and Macron, united by the flag of the European Union, and set them on fire.

&gt;At the same time, the head of the march has reached the Pla√ßa Comercial del Borne, where a political act has begun with the participation of members of the CUP and other independentist entities.

This was not true at the federal election in [2017](https://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2017-09-24-BT-DE/umfrage-alter.shtml) and the EU election in [2019](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article194198267/Europawahl-2019-Wer-waehlte-wen-nach-Alter-Beruf-Geschlecht.html), at both they were number six amongst young people at 10% and 7%. Greens, CDU, SPD, FDP and Left got more votes. 

The AfD does indeed do badly with 70+ old voters, because they usually don't change their opinions anymore. They do best with 40-60 years old voters, but not ""the youngest demographic"". Maybe at some local election like in Saxony they are second strongest with young voters, but even there they are stronger with older voters.

&gt;and that they make all efforts to ensure that their children integrate fully within European society.

You're mixing up terms left and right. Assimilation is not adoption and is not integration. The latter two colloquially mean simply getting along with others, learning the language and customs, being a regular member of the society. Expecting them to put their homeland #2 behind where they moved to is an attempt at assimilation and it will always fail. Especially in such a globalized world like ours, where people will stay in close touch with their culture no matter how much you dislike that.

5271,"&gt; Wind up violating it how?

Via setting up the border checkpoints.

Trade itself is fine, but the RoI cannot be in the European Union Customs Union without enforcing the outer border of that customs union, else it'll screw over the EU, which the EU -- reasonably, that's just how a customs union works -- isn't going to accept.  A country can't realistically be in the EU without being in the EUCU.  And the RoI isn't gonna leave the EU for a shot at NI.

&gt; Can't even... too petty...

It's the reason that the RoI is doing what they're doing and the reason that the UK is doing what they're doing regarding the backstop.  The UK would like to retain NI, and the RoI would like to have NI.
    
&gt; It seems that no deal that's acceptable to the current government will be acceptable to Parliament.

Well, you've said three things:

* That Parliament will not accept an agreement, even with the backstop removed. (That's your above-quoted text, especially in context of the next sentence.)

* That no deal that is acceptable to the government will be acceptable to Parliament (""and knowing full well that the brexiteer core of conservatives will vote down the agreement even if the backstop is removed."")

* That Boris Johnson wants no-deal. (""He's set on no-deal"")

I don't see any way that all three of those statements can simultaneously hold other than in the narrow technical sense of both of Parliament and Johnson wanting no-deal and the ""deals that are acceptable to the government but not acceptable to parliament"" being an empty set.

And even if that were true -- and I think that that is a very unlikely statement, as I can think of plenty of deals that would be advantageous to both the EU in aggregate and the UK at once -- you'd have a lot of difficult questions to answer:

* Why would the Brits bother negotiating in the first place?  Why bother having the huge argument over sequencing?  Why not just say ""we're not going to have a deal""?  They'd still have the A50 window, and it'd be easier for people and businesses to prepare.  That makes perfect sense if their aim is what I'd say it is -- negotiate everything but the Northern Ireland bit, then hand the RoI an up-or-down vote, saying ""either drop the backstop or we walk"".  And that's exactly what Boris has said that he's doing, aiming to get a deal without the backstop, but being willing to walk away if need be.  But it makes no sense if your proposal is true, if the government and Parliament don't intend on a deal.  Then their interest would be in simply terminating negotiations at the earliest date and as much of the A50 period to transition as possible.

* *I* think that Parliament has been mostly-politicking in its votes, and that they're for domestic consumption.  I'd say that nothing that has happened in Parliament recently has been particularly relevant to the process, which is conducted via the executive, and is the reason that Parliament's performed all these effectively-non-binding votes.  The way governments normally operate is that the legislature provides very high-level directives and the executive implements them, carries on negotiations with foreign governments, etc.  Parliament isn't likely to jump into the process, because the executive portion of the government is where the relevant expertise is -- the only reason that it's been doing *anything* is because you have lots of furious voters demanding outcome X, Y, or Z from legislators, and politically, they have to appear to be arguing for those outcomes.  What they've been doing is perfectly reasonable if *that* is their goal.

* I don't see any world in which the Brits would *ever* accept the backstop, just because I don't think that there's realistically a trade agreement that the EU would ever put on the table that the Brits would value more-highly than Northern Ireland.

* Even if you supposed that, the EU hasn't offered to make the terms of the WA being persistent contingent upon coming to a trade agreement acceptable to the UK and EU. If you think that the Brits would ever sign up for the backstop, then you're saying ""there's some trade deal that the EU would offer that would be worthwhile in exchange for it"".  But the EU *hasn't even shown what it's willing to put on the table in that trade deal*!  We don't know the contents of the trade deal.  Why do you think that the Brits would hand over something in advance without even knowing what the EU would put on the table?  If the EU's not willing to tell them what's on offer, they can *only* assume that that thing isn't something that they'd make a trade for, since otherwise the EU would strengthen its offer by placing those cards on the table.  If the EU seriously believes that it can put a trade deal on the table that the UK will trade for Northern Ireland, then it'd be in EU interests to make its withdrawal agreement one that will terminate if the EU and UK don't find common terms on a trade agreement...but that's not what the EU has offered.

&gt; This lunatic has suggested the whole thing could be solved if Ireland would just leave the EU.

The RoI isn't going to *do* that, and everyone knows that, but one of four things has to happen:

1. The UK gives up Northern Ireland.

2. The Republic of Ireland leaves the EUCU (and, therefore, the EU). &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; not going to happen

3. The EU lets the Republic of Ireland ignore enforcing the outer customs border of the European Union Customs Union.

4. The Republic of Ireland gives up the GFA route to acquire Northern Ireland.

The UK isn't going to permit (1), because that'd be a pretty bad idea from the standpoint of their interests.  I don't think that *anyone* expects (2) -- you bring it up to point out that it's not happening.    (3) is not going to happen because it's completely unreasonable for the EU, because all EUCU members agreed to these rules, because customs unions *have* to be enforced and not doing so would screw up the EUCU.

The only remaining thing that can give is (4).  And the UK and the EU can force (4) just by not coming to a deal.  Which means that they will do so if the alternative is worse.  Given that the UK can prevent #1 and considers it worse than #4, that the RoI can prevent #2 and considers it worse than #4, and that the EU can prevent #3 and considers it worse than #4, **#4 is going to happen**.  The specific *mechanism* via which it happens is something that could have been different.  Personally, I think that the *right* way to deal with the GFA going away would have been two years ago for all the parties to sit down and say to the publics in Europe ""this is unfortunate but the GFA is going away"".  Instead, the UK has spent two years saying ""the RoI can avoid #4 if the EU just gives in on #3"", which it knows perfectly well that the EU isn't going to do, and the EU has spent two years saying ""the RoI can avoid #4 if the UK just gives in on #1"", which it knows perfectly well that the UK isn't going to do.

&gt;&gt;But if the EU were to offer the UK an exempt status from its tax directive, they'd stay. 

-

&gt; As for the tax directive: This Tax Directive

Dude, no.

The British leadership and major political parties did not want Brexit.  If you gave *them* the call, there wouldn't be a Brexit.  You cannot buy off a few politicians, because they've politically put it out of their own hands.

Brexit is happening because you had (a) a major public revolt that flared up because of immigration and (b) Cameron gambled that he could win an up-or-down vote, which would shut up the Euroskeptics.

Once that referendum went through, there's no politically-viable way that the leadership can back out of it (short of possibly, as I've suggested before, a major shift in public opinion happening such that a second referendum becomes viable and *then* winning that referendum).  Cameron gambled high-stakes -- if he'd won, then the Euroskeptic crowd would have been politically stuck going along with what he wanted.  But the reason that people accept the results of votes not going their way is because they believe that had the vote gone otherwise, the winning result would have been acted upon.  It's maintaining that belief that requires you to follow votes.  That's why the ""look for a legal loophole"" or ""try and get Parliament to cancel A50"" routes are pointless -- because the barrier is not a legal one, but a political one.

I don't think that cancellation of Brexit is a realistic prospect at this point -- I mean, we can't know with absolute certainty until Brexit Day rolls around.  But if it does happen, it won't be because of some kind of tax incentive, but rather because the public's opinion shifts dramatically on the matter.  And I didn't see ""tax policy"" showing up on polls for reasons people who voted ""Leave"" considered important.

&gt;I believe that leaving the EU will change our trade deals and encourage british businesses to work together rather than buying from abroad all the time. This would help strengthen our economy, especially against a continually weakening Euro.

That's just not how it works. As romantic as that might sound, the practical reality is that British business gains from foreign trade and suffers when that trade is made more difficult. Essentially, if it was  actually beneficial to businesses to work with British companies more than they currently do, they'd already be doing it. No: if a company can make components better because of the expertise they have there, or we can't grow a certain thing here because of our climate, or myriad other things, British companies will buy their stuff and either use them to make new products, or sell them. The money goes around, jobs are created more efficiently, et cetera, et cetera.

And to compound the issue, *it goes two ways*! We're selling a shitload of stuff while we're at it. We can't trade all our stuff with ourselves, because we don't *want* any more of it than we currently buy. I've already got a British-made car; I don't want another one, let alone one that costs more because its components had to be made in this country.

Leaving the EU tips the balance towards less favourable options for British businesses that they wouldn't have otherwise considered. It will harm British manufacturers, both in the short and long term as their raw materials and components become more expensive to acquire. It will harm British retailers who are unable 

&gt;the lack of EU restrictions will allows us to make trade deals with countries we previously couldnt.

Those restrictions aren't there for shits and giggles. They are specifically designed to protect and encourage European industries, workers and consumers, including ours. I'm sure you're already aware of the very serious issues with a US-UK free trade agreement that render it unpalatable compared to our current setup, so I won't go into too much detail unless requested.

Trade deals of any kind involve give and take, and the reality is that the more powerful country always has the advantage, both in one-to-one trade deals between, say, the UK and China, but also when a third country is trying to get a trade deal with another country that we want one with:

Say Nigeria (set to dwarf our economy in the second half of the century) wants a trade deal with the UK and US, but the US has conditions that contradict ours. Nigeria chooses the US, obviously. But if that's a deal between Nigeria and the EU, they'll pick the EU because the EU acts as a collective that already outstrips the US and will do so by an even larger margin going forward.

&gt;As one economer put it ""we are not leaving the EU, we are joining the rest of the world.""

5356,"&gt;Japan is only formally a capitalist democracy. Their market players are in an interowned cartel called Keiretsu that has nothing to do with capitalism. You may call it corporativism but the system seems pretty centrally controlled.

I don't see how the the Keiretsu are different from Korean Chaebols, which were the backbone of integration of Korea into the global economy under Park Chung-hee. Maybe outsiders are screened from too much freedom to move assets, but it's not that the integration of Asian economies was a massive boon to the US-led global economy. To start with, it was a huge ideological success for liberalism. There's been a constant pressure to curb corporative grip in Korea in favor of laissez-faire, which I would guess globalists have their stake in too. But I don't tend to see economical conspiracies everywhere though. Despite Japan has been constantly pulling the blanket back and forth with the US, Japan is still a crucial ally against China, so the US could never afford to be too confrontational with them. And it's not that Japan had no fault of theirs whatsoever in the Lost Decade.

I agree that the Japanese really benefited from introducing planned economy features on a limited scale internally in spheres of production management, like Toyota famously did. They were learning from Soviet experience and mistakes, just like China did later. But the market forces largely drove the economy outside factory walls. Because it isn't a textbook example of a privately-run economy that would make Friedrich Hayek cum in his pants, doesn't mean it has to do anything with socialism. Japan was and is firmly anti-communist, in fact it's more social-nationalist that anything, not unlike what Georg Strasser proposed for the Third Reich, a more benign variant of fascism with more or less fulfilled class solidarity. Keiretsus may be run like a socialist enterprise, but they work largely for the global market, to benefit the political clans that rule them. Besides, this brand corporativism has obvious flaws too. You're being exploited, but in a kind of patriotic way. The youth is largely apathetic about it in both Japan and Korea, they're a fertile soil for more liberal populism for the global NGOs to play on.",,/r/europe/comments/d28k7q/poll_whose_side_should_your_country_take_in_a/ezwp3u2/,EwigeJude,1568221784

Who or what gives the UK the authority to use its military to ""free"" a foreign land? Maybe Yugoslavia and other countries should have armed the IRA to free Northern Ireland from British occupation, since according to your rationalization, it's completely justified to wage wars on the side of separatists in the name of self-determination.

5398,"Indulge me. What advantages do guns offer society? If I understand correctly you can use them: 


-To hunt (not really necessary in today's society, but it can be good for maintaining populations that do not have natural predators). Hunting for sport I find a detestable practice, there is fun to be had without murdering a living creature. And don't act as if someone in Europe can't survive without hunting, it's 2019 not 10,000 BC. 
-For sport. In that case, it becomes like any hobby, it's purely for fun. That's fine in itself, but society does not gain anything from it, it's just individual pleasure. Or are you telling me that I gain anything by you shooting some bullets in a tree?
-To kill humans. Pretty self explanatory. Not saying that gun owners go on murder sprees all the time, but a gun is a murder device after all. 


The original argument said that cars can also kill humans. Yet, cars offer easy, fast reliable transportation, can be used to bring sick people to hospitals. The foundation of our modern society is built on cars and mobility. Now, people also can have cars as a hobby, or watch car sports, which is an added bonus but not their main goal.

5435,"Because the governments that the US instated afterwards are particularly legitimate, eh? Yeah right. 

Its only been 30 years since the last time they did it. Nowadays, they tend to use more covert methods to try and overthrow governments, you know, assassination, supporting extremist groups inside those nations, the usual stuff.

Yes it is. International laws of warfare, among others the Geneva Convention, do cover what you can, and cant do in warfare situations. Deliberately killing civilians is one of the big things you absolutely cant do. 

Fact is that the US has done exactly that. If you simply meant to say that the US isnt a sane country, I would agree. Somehow I have the feeling thats not what you meant though.

Its a fact. The US has shown repeatedly that they have no concern for any of those. They use every trick in the book. Including the ones so evil theyre not even in this metaphorical book.

The Iraq War was, in fact, very quick. It started on the 20th march of 2003. It ended on the first may of 2003. A month and 11 days. Thats very fast by war standards. Now what you might refer to is that the conflict didnt just end there. But that was merely a miscalculation of the US. They figured that if they managed to get a surrender, depose Hussein and occupy the nation, the rest would work out fine. As we know now, it sure as hell didnt.

Iraqi Civilians killed during the Iraq War and Occupation? About 600000 were killed during the first 4 years of both. The biggest source of deaths being the US. So, about 200000, give or take. 

They mostly arent. Who knows why, maybe theyre just too expensive and their odds of being shot down in regular warfare scenarios make that too costly, but drones are almost exclusively used for extrajudicial killings.

It is. 3rd article of the Geneva Conventions I believe. You can read it on the ICRC website, they do keep the whole thing freely available.

No assumption, simply stating facts. We know theyre conducting extrajudicial killings. We know theyre breaking the laws by doing so.

None? This are all well-documented things that have been happening for quite some time and still are happening. And we know that the US knows that theyre doing that given the part I said next.

What does the law have to do with it? Its not like the ICC is gonna be able to prosecute them since the US made sure thats not gonna happen, including threats of invasion. And its not like the US courts are gonna do anything about it. This is just PR. The US releases falsified statistics to try and claim that their drone strikes are totally not horrificly inaccurate, with studies showing that only 13% of people killed by them were even *targets*. 

The US is not waging war against Pakistan. Never have. They cant really, that would cause biiiig problems.

First, if done deliberately or recklessly (which is absolutely true for the US) it absolutely is. It violates a whole bunch of articles of the Geneva convention. But second, even ignoring that, your best fucking argument is that ""oh theyre slaughtering civilians, but its not *illegal* so its fine"". 

Self-defence by attacking another nation is stupid, and illegal. What, would the USSR have been justified in bombing the shit out of military bases and nearby cities in the US after the US invaded one of their allied south american nations? Of course not. 

Oh but they can. They can rule if it violates their sovereignty, or if its against their internal laws. After that, international law which prohibits doing that kicks in. 

Yeah, ""randomly"". Its not like Im listing the most ""sacred"" international laws that the US is violating like theres no tomorrow. Its just ""random"".

Oh no, I am. You however, clearly arent. Either you are so insanely biased for the US, that you would welcome them even if they invaded *your nation*, killed *your family* and overthrew *your government*, or you are just a troll. Im still not sure which one.

There isnt. It *is* the biggest threat to world peace. Has been a long time. They have destabilized the entire middle east, fucked over the entirety of south american with *very* long-lasting effects, felt to this day, overthrown democracies and replaced them with dictatorships and various other horrific war crimes and crimes against humanity. The only people who dont think that are uber-patriotic US people, or uneducated shills like you.

But let me perhaps hammer this point home. Being from Estonia, you surely are aware of Russias aggression, meddling and in the case of Ukraine invasion of eastern europe, yes? Consider this: To most of the world, the US is to them what russia is to you. But worse. So much worse. Russia is at least unpopular enough that they are forced to minimize civilian casualties. Hence why throughout the entire Ukrainian conflict, ""only"" 3300 civilians died. The US isnt. They killed more civilians in just the single mont that the Iraq War lasted, than Russia has in 5 fucking years. 

And the thing is, this used to be just what South america and the middle east thought. But the Iraq War, the illegal invasion, the horrible things we heard afterwards, it opened the eyes of many people. Even US allies like germany now overwhelmingly see the US as the biggest threat to world peace.",,/r/europe/comments/d28k7q/poll_whose_side_should_your_country_take_in_a/ezwds3k/,UNOvven,1568214319

It likely might mean that a nation-wide revolt takes place, seeking to depose the monarchy.

It would divide the entire UK in a heart beat, better than any Brexit ever could.

No matter which side the Queen takes over for, she would have approximately half the nation out for her. That includes politicians, judges, police, the military and the population. The UK's population isn't somehow hard-wired to just accept the Monarchy grabbing power again, they're not clones being told to execute Order 66.

Every human alive today only knows a Monarchy that does not interfere with real politics. Contemporary knowledge (how things are done NOW) trump ancient rules and customs.

However, your position is simply incorrect, we need a further referendum as (1) the view of the public has clearly changed, (2) the clear procedural irregularities on the part of the Leave campaign in the first one (to the extent that if it were a general election the result would have been voided) and (3) no deal has no mandate and a referendum between May's deal, no deal and Remain is the only way to resolve the current deadlock in a democratic way.

The various levels of deal that the EU would accept have been clear from the start. The problem isn't the EU being unwilling to negotiate, the problem is brexiteer fantasists who i) can't agree among themselves what kind of deal they would actually want, and ii) believe in UK exceptionalism so deeply that they think we can just blindly state what we want and get it.

The idea that the EU wants a situation of unending uncertainty, postponements and extensions is laughable. They are not the problem. We are the problem.",,/r/europe/comments/d2nqdp/the_sentiment_in_scotland_is_one_i_fully_agree/ezw3nlp/,ilikepix,1568206994

The EUs motto is literally ""Unity in Diversity"". 

Phrasing a high office in a way that makes it seem as though there is one sole way of life is not only taking a faulty rhetoric from far right nationalists and xenophobic, thus validating their shitty beliefs, it goes against the spirit of the whole thing. Europe harbours anything from hardcore fascists and clerical fanatics, to die hard communists and antitheists. There is oppression and undemocratic tendencies, there are protests and liberal states. Every point on the political spectrum, every religion, every bloody type of person.

There is no ""European way of life"". Just like there is no ""German"" or ""French"" or whatever way of life. There are differences between the average French and the average german person, yes, but there are also a lot of differences between groups within those nations, nevermind individuals. And the EU is no different. You can say that Europeans tend towards democracy, but judging by some of our politicians and governments, and how successful they are, that sure isnt a universal ideal. Itd be nice if it were, but it's not. A lot of Europeans sure seem to struggle with the principles that allegedly define them.

Some of those things, like democracy, are principles of the European Union, though, which are not the same as a ""European way of life"", though they well could be. And all member states agree to uphold them, with various results. But their people may or may not do so.

If you wanted an office that deals with border control, migration and what appears to be some sort of educational matters(?), which, kinda weird combination, but ok, why not go for something that actually encompasses those things without using phrasing with shitty connotations. Like, idk, the ""Comissioner for Furthering and Securing the Principles of the Union"", or ""Commissioner for Peace, Prosperity and Protection"", or something. I'm sure they could think of something.

All that industry that hardline Soviet sympathizers brag about would have turned useless if there ceased to be a central anchor to it. And with the grim future prospects for USSR it was doomed to happen. Planned economy of that scale is a very ambitious prospect, and while it had had some unique benefits, the Soviet system didn't find a way to overcome systemic challenges like lack of innovation, growth of productivity, skew towards heavy industry and poor quality of consumer goods (that largely define living standards), not to mention lack of their variety and shortages. Soviets were good at subsidizing the most basic amenities like housing, healthcare and education. It was all a massive improvement for, say, Central Asia, but for Central Europe it was by all means a downgrade compared to the Interwar era. But it wasn't lack of amenities that pushed EE to become so anti-communist (post-WW2 Europe wasn't too affluent anyway), it was lack of freedom of information and political persecutions.

The Pew poll showed that among  Europeans, a median of 49 percent of respondents thought their country  should not defend an ally, a response that exposes a lack of commitment  to collective defense. Not only that: the majority of Europeans (67  percent), with the surprising exception of the Poles¬†(49 percent),  believed the United States would come to the defense of its allies.....

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;..... That aside, the biggest response against using force against Russia came  from Germany. Only 38 percent of Germans, the lowest score among the  eight NATO allies polled, would use force to defend an ally. 

This is a pretty damning indication that there is powerful sense of both selfishness and entitlement among a large portion of the populace in Europe. It's actually quite disgusting to consider that so many well-off people expect other to come to their defense if needed but would have absolutely no intention of doing anything themselves if the roles were reversed.

5772,"&gt;They are literally not the same group. They aren't the same people. The dead are dead. 

By this criteria you and your grandfather (after he dies) will no be part of the same people. 

&gt;To say ""Turk"" or ""Greek"" while encompassing a millennium or two makes the terms themselves pointless. You can't derive anything meaningful from these words if the scope is so wide, you can only use them for nationalist fantasy.

It is not fantasy, while the group changes it does change gradually and based on events that happened to the group. 

For example while people cry about how ancient Greeks were pagans and not Christians like the modern Greeks.

 However the modern Greeks are not randomly Christians they are Christians because Greeks more than a 1000 years ago converted to Christianity. Turks are Muslim because of what happened to Turks that lived centuries ago.

 And each has enmity for the other due to events that happened to Greek/Turks that lived decades and centuries ago.

You might argue philosophically that they are not the same group, but in reality you can see that the idea of a nation actually has an effect in history.

&gt;Why is it fantasy?

Because i did not live in that era and were not part of any pro genocide camp. It did not happen. It is a fantasy and an attack on me because you cannot find any real arguments. 

&gt;And how is this related to the invasion of Anatolia?
Greeks invaded Anatolia for the same reasons they rebelled on mainland Greece. Mistreatment by the Turks. The genocides were just the latest mistreatment.

In reality, it is mainly the black neighborhoods which are dangerous and riddled with crime, and healthcare is excellent for the majority of Americans.

5849,"&gt; The most common complaint I've heard is that stuff just sounds better in English, and anything translated to accommodate your language comes off as cheesy to you guys. I've compared some stuff in multiple languages, mostly Disney movies, animated shows I could find and some books, but I don't notice a huge difference in this regard.

It does feel cheesy, but I don't think it is because of the translation, because most of those things are equally cheesy in English. But I've been consuming media in English for three decades and I'm so used to it by now that I don't notice it there, but it stands out when I read/hear it in Polish. 

It's very annoying, but I sometimes find myself unable to play a game if it's not in English. One example would be Dragon Age 3 - it was released in Poland with only Polish and Russian language options, but I managed to mod it and play in English. Some time after I got the game a path broke the mod and I found myself unable to play the game. Interestingly enough I don't usually have the same feeling towards books, unless the translation is particularly bad.

&gt; The biggest complaint I hear from the smaller countries when it comes to gaming is:
""You shouldn't be playing a game in X (Dutch, Portuguese, Polish), because playing in English helps you learn so much.""

That's just bullshit, not everything has to be educational. Even though I myself prefer English I can't imagine telling something like that to anyone, especially if their grasp on the language is not great.

There are exceptions though - for example the Polish version of Shreck is in my opinion far superior to the original, mostly because the localisation team didn't try to translate it 1:1, but instead replaced the USA-centered jokes with Polish ones and it works great. Also the works of Terry Pratchett were masterfully translated by someone who obviously cared and are an absolute pleasure to read.",Polishing my English,/r/europe/comments/d2jtua/for_nonenglish_native_speakers_what_do_you_think/ezvn6u2/,snsibble,1568185744

We don't even know what is the strategy of defense in this kind of situation cause it newer happened in near past... Not to mention ground forces has their own anti-air, anti-naval forces, that is a big advantage.

Now in Russian offence toward Europe it would be different situation. But mainly if you have strong and big ground forces supported by air and sea you could quickly advance.

US isn't bordering with Russia so their ground forces couldn't go full potential. Even if Russia invade Alaska US isn't accessible because of Canada.",,/r/europe/comments/d28k7q/poll_whose_side_should_your_country_take_in_a/ezviekl/,hajduk019,1568179421
