 &gt;After the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the U.S. shifted its interest from Afghanistan. American funding of Hekmatyar and his Hezb-i-Islami party was cut off immediately. The U.S. also reduced its assistance for Afghan refugees in Pakistan. In October 1990, U.S. President George H. W. Bush refused to certify that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear explosive device, triggering the imposition of sanctions against Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment (1985) to the Foreign Assistance Act (1961).

The mujahideen were also supported by Britain's MI6,  
 who conducted separate covert actions. The program leaned heavily   
towards supporting militant Islamic groups, including groups with jihadist ties, that were favored by the regime of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in neighboring Pakistan, rather than other, less ideological Afghan resistance groups that had also been fighting the Soviet-oriented Democratic Republic of Afghanistan regime since before the Soviet intervention.\[1\]

105,"&gt;They can wring a bit of slack out of them, and on a grid the size of France that helps a bit. France still relies on gas and hydro to do the heavy lifting for their flexible power

It would be silly to use nuclear for load following when you have hydro. Same is somewhat true for gas now that using gas is still acceptable. 

There is also a huge difference in using gas to supplement nuclear like France does, which leads to 5-10% fossil fuels share, and to use gas to supplement  intermittent renewables which leads to 50-60% fossil fuels share (Belgiums post-nuclear plan). 

&gt;And their dirty secret still is that they are only able to afford to use nuclear plants flexibly by the oversubsidy in the past. If you propose a private company to build a nuclear plant knowing that it can only be used as flexible supplementation, they'll laugh you out of the door.

Private sector would be happy to provide nuclear as flexible supplementation if the climate goals of the countries would a) be ambitious enough and b) technology-neutral. Currently the goals are not very ambitious (55% by 2030) so that can easily be done with gas.  That, together with targets that specify that ""X percentages of generation must be from renewables"" and ""hydrogen/gas must be made from electricity sourced from renewables"" make nuclear a tough sell.

Renewables are the cheapest way to reduce upto 30-50% of your  emissions, but grids decarbonized more than that without nuclear and/or hydropower are science fiction. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I like science fiction, but I don't base energy policy on it. Nuclear promises are a dime a dozen, call us when it's ready.

Now we are back to my original point that the only proven solutions to decarbonize the grid are hydropower and nuclear. 

&gt;Thermal energy storage helps a bit, but it's also possible to fuel it with solar thermal

Solar thermal storage works but requires direct sunlight without even slightest cloud coverage. Those tiny high altitude cirrus clouds that don't much effect solar panels ruin solar thermal. Still I still expect solar thermal with thermal storage to become common in countries with deserts with right conditions. 

&gt;and in any case inadequate for seasonal storage.

Nuclear doesn't need seasonal storage, that is handled by scheduled maintenance. What is your ""non-science fiction"" solution for seasonal variation?",Finland,/r/europe/comments/oa4npx/in_2020_electricity_generation_from_fossil_fuels/h3nis6q/,electrify_all_things,1625119091

240,"The 1903 Tour de France was the first cycling race set up and sponsored by the newspaper L'Auto, ancestor of the current daily, L'Équipe. It ran from 1 to 19 July in six stages over 2,428 km, and was won by Maurice Garin.

The concept was born at the table of a brasserie on one of the wide boulevards of Paris in the midst of a war between the newspapers Le Vélo and L'Auto. Géo Lefèvre suggested to Henri Desgrange challenging riders to a stage race around the whole country: the Tour de France. Desgrange, his boss, eventually warmed up to the idea… but not before calling it ""insane"". 

The initial idea for the race didn’t attract too much interest. A five week race, with a 20 franc entry fee wasn’t much of an incentive. So they shortened the race to 19 days, halved the entry fee and increased the prize money. 75 people signed up in the end, with 60 actually beginning the race.

On 1 July 1903, sixty riders gathered in front of the café Le Réveil-Matin in Montgeron, in the outskirts of Paris, to start the 467 km inaugural stage to Lyon. Just 6 stages back then but they were a lot further than the stages today. The stages were as follows:

* Stage 2: Lyon to Marseilles
* Stage 3: Marseilles to Toulouse
* Stage 4: Toulouse to Bordeaux

https://www.flightglobal.com/fixed-wing/lockheed-martin-confident-f-35-operating-cost-will-be-reduced-to-25000-per-hour/142577.article

&gt; In theory, a multi-year performance-based logistics contract would allow Lockheed to take ownership and control of the whole maintenance and sustainment process of the F-35. That is, opposed to a more conventional maintenance contract which tends to cause customers to order parts and services in disconnected, one-off transactions.

So what will happen is tha Lockheed is saying that they'll start doing the maintenance for the plane and they'll be the ones to get the numbers down.


How odd. It kinda really seem that LM is trying their best to eliminate any competition **and force the USAF to lock in deeper into LM**.


Here's a q for you: how many times has the F-35 gone over budget in its history? 


Isn't it funny how a company that has constantly been over-budget claims that if you spend way more with them in the next 5 years you'll totally get your money back! And then some!

332,"So you planned to intercept plane with only 50% of fuel inside ? Do you realize it's stupid ?

And you compare plane with 50% of fuel with plane with 100% of fuel ? If the rafale has a 0.988 t2w ratio with 100% with 4 A2A missile which is a real configuration, a bit of logic would tell you that getting rid of half the fuel will end up in the same situation, but 50% fuel really isnt at ALL an A2A config, especially for a plane intended to do interception jobs which involves afterburner.

Also the rafale fuel consumption is lower than the F35 so you could even claim that youc an take off more for the same combat radius so increasing the t2w.

&amp;#x200B;

 For the aero and the drag it's wrong also, the aero of the f35 is crap to fulfill its main point, eing stealthy. That's why the Rafale is faster and moves better at low speed. That's why the typhone is MUCH more faster and moves betters at high speed.

342,"well, that's an example of how you can play with data to ""prove"" whatever you want.

The price of gas under that contract was tied to the price of oil, as is customary. At the time the project was announced (which is what the article is quoting as the ""expected"" price) oil was at $100+ and so gas was projected to yield $350. That's math, not a boy-scout promise. 

The price from January 2021 which is also quoted in the article is based on the average for the past 9 months,as per formula, which if you look up the graph, was the lowest dip during that period (hitting low $20 in April 2020 due to Covid).

Oil prices have since recovered to $75 and continue to grow, so the gas will bounce back as well.

There is nothing nefarious about it, that's the nature of the oil &amp; gas market - you make major capital investments and wait for the price to hit your target. You lose some, you gain some. Oil can go over $100 and Gazprom will be making money hand over fist.

Just remember a wave of bankruptcies of US shale drilling companies and then record profits and bankruptcies again. In any case, that's a tiny hit for Gazprom at their size and they can afford strategic development with long-term upside.

My point was that Japan's golden age was from the late 40's until probably some point in the 70's with filmmakers like Kurosawa, Ozu, Mizoguchi, Naruse, Kobayashi, Honda, Teshigahara, etc. That's not an entire century but well, 30 years. By 1980 the cinema audience had dropped to 1/6th of what it was in 1960 and the studios started to struggle big time. The japanese biggest live action production of the 1980's (Kurosawa's Ran) is actually a Japano-French co-production another one of the big productions of the 80's is Mishima which is a USA-Japan co-production (with the USA being the senior production partner), I think it kinda indicates the direction. There is an entire host of sleazy genre films from Japan starting in probably the 60's including very interesting and transgressive films but they're also a symptom of the decline of Japanese cinema. The 90's saw a bit of a reversal of this trend putting such names as Kitano, Miike, Kore-eda, Sono or Kon on the map but it's hardly a true return to form and it seems Japanese cinema is doing worse again than in the 90's (at least outside of anime) with many of the names emerging from South-East Asia coming from China, South Korea or the Phillipines instead. 

Going by 2012 data French films had 145 mio. admissions abroad, 225 mio. in total. Japanese films had somehwere around the 100 mio. mark in Japan and a very limited number of exports. 2012 was an unusually good year for France but in the bad years they still more or less draw even with Japan. Generally the french film market varies more with the year because there are fewer but bigger productions however there are a couple of factors involved here. The Japanese national market share is higher (the french one is also rather good though) but even with twice the population the total number of admissions is lower than in France (France has a huge film culture). On top of that French films overall have more international draw, particularly the European market is strong and stable for France but Asia is growing as a market for French films too (the exports are actually what makes France competitive with the larger home market of Japan).

&gt;This assessment of the Basic Treaty was confirmed in a decision of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1973:  
&gt;  
&gt;""... the German Democratic Republic is in the international-law sense a State and as such a subject of international law. This finding is independent of recognition in international law of the German Democratic Republic by the Federal Republic of Germany. **Such recognition has not only never been formally pronounced by the Federal Republic of Germany but on the contrary repeatedly explicitly rejected**. If the conduct of the Federal Republic of Germany towards the German Democratic Republic is assessed in the light of its détente policy, in particular the conclusion of the Treaty as de facto recognition, then it can only be understood as **de facto recognition of a special kind**. The special feature of this Treaty is that while it is a bilateral Treaty between two States, to which the rules of international law apply and which like any other international treaty possesses validity, it is between two States that are parts of a still existing, albeit incapable of action as not being reorganized, comprehensive State of the Whole of Germany with a single body politic.""",,/r/europe/comments/oaxiex/1980s_british_guide_for_first_time_travelers/h3l4mh7/,MonitorMendicant,1625076011

831,"Vladimir Putin, the president of the Russian Federation, in his article in Die Zeit once again presented his original vision of World War II. The Soviet Union appears only as a victim of the aggression of the Third Reich, which, after repelling the invasion, turned into the ""Savior of Europe"".  
  
Putin, of course, is not an amateur historian, but a leader of a state whose modern identity is shaped by the glorification of imperial traditions.  
  
Putin's offer to Germany looks like this: the European Union, dominated by Germany, would become part of the great community created by the union with the Eurasian Union, which in turn is dominated by Russia.  
  
President Putin's proposal is deeply embedded in his own vision of World War II, in which an affirmative attitude to the Hitler-Stalin Pact plays a key role. It made it easier for Hitler to unleash a war in Europe. In return, Stalin was given a free hand to enslave the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe.  
  
It was no accident that in recent years, Russia, when making territorial annexations and occupations, used the same methods that Stalin used to enslave Central Europe and the Baltic states in 1939–1989.  
  
Thanks to the great tribute of blood of all the peoples of the USSR, especially the Ukrainians, Belarusians and Russians, Stalin managed to defend and extend the sphere of influence that he had received from Hitler in Yalta. As a result, ""from Szczecin on the Baltic Sea to Trieste on the Adriatic Sea"" Europe was divided by the Iron Curtain. Russia has a long practice of luring democratic leaders into an imperial trap.  
  
The Iron Curtain also divided Germany. Therefore, overcoming the division of Germany was tantamount to overthrowing the Yalta order and regaining freedom by the nations of Eastern Europe. Freedom, on the other hand, is the possibility of sovereign decision-making about the model of development, ways of implementing social aspirations, it is a victory over keeping people in concentration camps and gulags, it is the possibility of applying for membership in the EU and NATO. The construction of Europe whole, free and at peace, initiated by US President George H, Bush in 1989, was based on the rejection of the model based on a concert of powers in favor of the idea of ​​freedom and democratization of international relations. This is an alternative to the model proposed by Putin.  
  
The German concept of Wandel durch Handel plays an important role in this vision of President Putin . Putin has successfully restrained this concept and, as befits an experienced Judoka, uses German cooking for dialogue to change Germany and make it more like Russia. Along with the gas from Nord Stream, Germany is to import the idea of ​​a concert of powers and a kleptocratic development model based on the interdependence of politics, business and the criminal world.  
  
Therefore, Germany should reject Putin's proposal and favor the model of Europe of freedom, overcoming antagonisms not through the behind-the-scenes agreements of the concert of powers, but by supporting an order based on international law and the democratic principle of respect for the sovereign equality of all states, in line with the slogan ""free with free, equal with equal "".  
  
The launch of the NS 2 gas pipeline will be a time of testing for Germany and a choice between these two models. Putin set an imperial trap for Germany, in which some of the German elite bought shares. One of my predecessors in the office of the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs once said in Berlin that he was more afraid of German inactivity than of strength. Today I am afraid of the German lack of responsibility for the consequences of Putin's cooperation with Russia.  
  
Completing Nord Steam 2 will create a huge security deficit for the entire eastern flank of NATO. Ukraine, on the other hand, will find itself in a security vacuum. That is why I call on the Germans to take responsibility for their own choices regarding the launch of NS2 and their real, not simulated, contribution to compensating for security deficits. Putin did not bear the enormous costs of building NS 2 in order not to use this instrument. It is therefore necessary to strengthen the deterrence potential of both NATO's eastern flank and Ukraine, which, as a victim of Russian aggression, should receive sufficiently high compensation, both in the form of political support and an increase in its defense potential. Poland is ready to participate in compensating the resulting deficits.  
  
The only test for the truthfulness of the sense of responsibility declared by the German elites for the crimes of the Third Reich is to take actual responsibility for the peace and democratic shape of European politics here and now, especially after the launch of Nord Stream 2.",,/r/europe/comments/ob0c77/putin_lures_germany_into_a_trap/h3ko11n/,GreatBigTwist,1625068848

850,"&gt;This is not different for nuclear power.

I am really confused here, what is not going to be different? Storage, winter? both are absolutely different, because nuclear can make energy on demand and downscale during surplus.

&gt;Nuclear is not quick. And believe me, you'd have people camping to prevent a new nuclear site.

Yes you're right there. It will take at least a decade or more. But I meant more of a readily available technique, to be used when resistance to wind turbines is going to be bigger than nuclear. For some reason though, political parties are still to scared to mention and inform their upsides to the people, but when that happens support shall rise and far outweigh resistance. And I think resistance to nuclear is already decreasing as more media is picking up on their potential, and the science, as a pragmatic alternative. 

&gt;Then explain why no commercial firms want to build nuclear plants without ample subsidies and state support?

Companies dont think in long term but short term, nuclear requires about 20 years to be even with renewable with current cost/MW. This might be a bit longer still with future improvements of renewable but once nuclear is running, its cheaper than renewable and they probably run for 50+ years. Thus, margins are initially too low and heavily dependent on government support. For nuclear to be a viable option, it needs societal/government/national agreement that it becomes a ""base-supplier"" and backup. This is exactly how I foresee a robust transition for this century until we can completely shift to a more renewable system and we have safeguarded low levels of CO2. Also carefulness of the fearmongering people have been fed for the last 50 years by tree-hugging instances. (And I ridicule them from a scientific point of view, not a screw-nature type which I thoroughly oppose).

&gt;Which security? Belgium had 6 of its 7 nuclear plants down in the middle of winter of 2018.

This is creating a sentiment and not an argument, use proper data to show nuclear is unreliable. Also, old reactors and we are talking about making new, safer ones.

&gt;This applies just as well to renewables, with the difference that the base price of renewable electricity is 3-4 times cheaper.

Excuse me yes, I meant an excess in power of a hybrid system with both nuclear and renewables, to reduce prices for such techniques to establish in heavy industry. But if we are going to invest a lot of money into storage of renewable energy (which will be needed if we dont incorporate nuclear but still abolish any carbon based energy carrier) to accommodate for weather and seasonal variations, we might not produce enough energy to ""smoothen"" the transition from heavy industry. 

&gt;I'm sorry, if the nuclear industry could run on promises, we would have an inexhaustible supply. But it can't.

The science is already there. since the 70s. Look up the Oak Ridge National Laboratory which ran molten salt thorium reactor experiments from the 1960s until 1976. Its not like nuclear fusion which is currently purely a academical exercise. The only thing preventing its success is the corrosive nature of molten salts.

&gt;They have had all opportunity to develop themselves, but they simply failed to do so.

Not due to all the scaremongering from green ideologists that just want everyone to live in nature and not in a overpopulated world with an **uncontrollable** hunger for energy. Nuclear is right next to wind and solar in safety. But contrary to fighting against coals, they chose to put their effort in nuclear. All safety concerns from currently old reactor can be easily addressed in newer models or are not applicable to the BENELUX.

&gt;nuclear power has been coddled and kickstarted by politicians right after WW2

Which is fine and needs to be done again. Energy supply should be a communal effort, not private. Just like roads and rails and water. It is an investment in a smooth economy.

In the end, for now renewable turbines and solar are definitely the cheapest option. But we're only at the beginning of implementation and prices will increase with storage and measures to handle the NIMBY's. So it becomes more difficult to increase our renewable percentages at later points. Also, look at all the effort we have done with turbine parks and solar, yet we have still such a small percentage of truly renewable energy. Speed might pick up a bit more, but it will be too little too late. We will never make the deadline in 2050, the BENELUX is just too densely populated and industrialised. Don't forget the digital economy is increasing rapidly as well, sucking up all new renewable energy sources (server hubs in Noord Holland, for instance). So, I don't see nuclear as a way to replace renewables, but more as an investment to lower prices down the pipeline of the industry and make their own transition cheaper, at the mid-long term. This improves Dutch industry competitiveness, while securing a reduction of CO2 emissions and air pollution by 2050. I am just pessimistic that reaching for a completely renewable system in 2050 will not be the fastest not make it the cheapest option nor a goal that can be reached due to societal problems. It is too big of a jump to make in one time.

882,"The old assumption was strong economies give rise to the rule of law and this is the basis upon which a democracy is established. This isn’t a uniquely EU mentality but rather a western, neo-liberal philosophy that was endorsed by the US post World War 2. The same policies were subsequently applied to many Middle Eastern countries, Middle Eastern countries and even Russia in the 90’s during its transition to a market based society. This mentality was also the basis for the austerity response in 2008 and 2012.

This is obviously a dated philosophy and it’s without a doubt now a discussion laid to rest - something new is required and the rule of law isn’t a naturally occurring phenomenon that arises as the result of market activity. The rule of law requires consistent vindication and positive affirmation which in turn creates markets and democracies based upon markets. This is the current EU methodology and it was adopted last year with the launch of the new Eurobonds and the 2020 Rule of Law Commission Report. 

As I mentioned in my initial comment - this is all relatively new. The emergence of undemocratic actors within the EU and the subsequent shift in political economic thought in the Western world is an unfolding process and we should expect more political unity amongst Member Stares in the coming decades. What I said isn’t a revelation, it’s been noted for a long time but it’s just all prior arguments and controversies were about economics and politics and not the very foundations of democracy. 

With the June 2020 summit concluding and the emergency MMF reforms implemented we should expect to see much more in the future. Eurobonds were unthinkable 10 years ago and we witnessed historical adversaries in the European politics actually sit and agree with each other on the need for a change in direction. Let’s also not forget that a prominent anti-austerity political figure now leads the ECB so the changes are already underway. It isn’t a coincidence that as we enter a period of political Union at long last we are also seeing an increase in nefarious destabilising activity and attempts to undermine democracy in Europe.",,/r/europe/comments/oatitb/eu_is_planning_legal_action_against_poland_over/h3kotzr/,Thom0,1625069185

&gt; AUR and VOX launch the idea of a Conservative Reconquest of Europe  
&gt; https://i.imgur.com/1aVGTCO.png  
&gt; A delegation of the AUR leadership met in Madrid on 25 June with President Santiago Abascal and First Vice-President Jorge Buxadé Villalba of the Spanish right-wing, national-conservative party VOX. The latter is also Vice-President of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) party, to which AUR is currently affiliated.

&gt; AUR and VOX have launched the idea of a modern European Reconquista. Genuinely European conservative parties are today at the forefront of a symbolic European recovery of Christian values. Just as centuries ago the Spanish people recaptured medieval Spain from the Moors, and the Romanian people stopped the Ottoman Empire's advance into the West, today conservative parties from countries geographically in Eastern and Western Europe are fighting to return a secularised, value-blind Europe to its roots. Europe needs to rediscover its own identity and Christian soul, and conservatives must support this rediscovery.

&gt; We are the ""last barrier"", the last line of national and European sovereignist resistance against globalism: we will not be crossed - said representatives of the two parties.

&gt; Other topics of common interest were discussed, such as the situation of Romanian communities in Spain, illegal immigration, coordination of conservative forces at European level against neo-Marxism, levelling progressivism and the ideology of political correctness, cooperation and mutual support in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), and the accession of the AUR to the European Conservatives and Reformists group.  

&gt; On behalf of AUR participated:  

&gt; Mr. Sorin LAVRIC, President of the AUR Senate and Senator in the Romanian Parliament and Secretary of the Romanian Senate;  
&gt; Mr. Andrei DÎRLĂU, AUR Coordinator for International Relations, Parliamentary Counsellor in the Romanian Senate;  
&gt; Mr Ionuț NEAGU, Senator in the Romanian Parliament, Secretary of the Committee for Human Rights, Equal Opportunities, Cults and Minorities of the Romanian Senate.  

&gt; On behalf of VOX participated:

&gt; Mr. Santiago ABASCAL, President of VOX; 
&gt; Mr. Jorge BUXADÉ VILLALBA, VOX First Vice-President for Political Affairs, Vice-President of the Party of European Conservatives and Reformists;

1044,"I disagree with you as it seems you think what Trump did was revocable or not wholly destructive. 

1. You need to say Trump &amp; the GOP. How many bills have been passed by GOP to weaken the electoral franchise? Over 450. Had they been passed in 2016 Biden would have lost. That's state capture. Moreover the electoral vote count is now subject to validation by GOP politicians in at least one state who has the legal authority to overturn the count. 

2. The Supreme Court. 
[Book reveals Trump effort to persuade Justice Kennedy to step aside for Kavanaugh](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/04/trump-family-anthony-kennedy-brett-kavanaugh-dark-towers)

There are lots of theories why Justice Kennedy resigned. Here's an interesting fact. Was he manipulated or pressured by Trump to resign? Was Kennedy intending to resign? No.

&gt;Justice Kennedy was not planning to resign next term. We know, because he already appointed his clerks for that term... John Califra.

3. Trump's disassembling of public administration. Trump put unqualified people in charge of numerous Federal agencies. Trump ordered that for example, the science be removed from the public record. That means/strategies of evaluation for public policy be shut down. Trump has fatally weakened the role of science in the USA. Science can't be relied on to be objective, seen as providing independent data. Trump, arguably, has fatally weakened the independence of the bureaucracy providing best or evidence based practice to suit corrupt or self interested corporations.

4. My metaphor for Trump and how the GOP now acts is that they are the water in the basement of the Florida/Surfside condo. Trump &amp; the GOP have undermined the ability of a Federal government to provide checks and balances to safeguard democracy.

5. Having Barr say the Mueller investigation cleared Trump, and stopping the report stone cold, is THE prime example that Trump and his cronies undermined Democracy. Trump WAS NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

6. In that vein, along with Murdoch &amp; Koch, belief in democracy has been completely undermined. To the point, and I strenuously disagree with you over your term
&gt;Capital riots 

Trump and his cronies attempted a putsch. 

7. Thus the angle I'm taking is not arguing whether you are right or not over Trump, that he was able to 'entrench' himself. I argue Trump, his cronies &amp; the GOP have weakened the American State severely and subject to time to what degree. It is yet to be determined if they have weakened American democracy fatally. 

7b. &gt;The separation of power (courts, legislative, executive, media) was harmed but even after the Capitol riots they still survived. 

That is almost an outrageous statement. You are saying the checks and balances of a democratic system survived, Trump did not kill it. Should he not have been able to do so? After one 4 yr term of Trump a ~350 year old nation that is the strongest nation in the world, is still intact. It's a bit like me saying well I didn't conquer Everest in a day. Or gee I'm surprised I didn't learn to fly from scratch a F22 in just a day. Really mate, the world's strongest nation to be fatally weakened by a one term President and saying it didn't happen is just stating the obvious, **you don't make a defence of that** - you ask what did Trump et al do to weaken the US State. Even Hitler with his Putsch in 1923 took another decade to wrest control and that in a war ravaged, internally destabilised, weakened nation only barely 50 years old.",,/r/europe/comments/oar35o/a_hindenburg_election_poster_from_1932_saying/h3juii0/,ProostafoamyStoregga,1625054464

I don't want to live in a 100% nuclear world and it won't be possible anyway, just like a 100% solar or wind world is possible. Unless we drastically diminish our level of consumption.

&gt;The problems with that are long term waste storage, safety, public acceptance, very high cost and dependence on government subsidies, running out of fule

All the nuclear waste in the world fits in small stadium, long term waste storage isn't a problem, it never hurt anyone and we can bury it deep, we have much more pressing problems. Safety is largely sufficient, it's the energy with the lowest death/KWh ratio.

Public acceptance is indeed a problem but a made up one, leaders should choose the best solution, not the one the public likes. 

The very high cost is real compared to fossil fuels. A complete nuclear system is far cheaper than a complete solar/wind one (if it's even possible) and government subsidies aren't a problem, nuclear power should be a state endeavor, not a private one, electricity is infrastructure/utility, it should be a free market.

Nothing is going to work on a global scale. Neither wind, nor solar, nor nuclear nor anything else, each country will choose what's in their best interests. Right now they're choosing a solar/wind+gas/coal mix, not a nuclear one. It emits more but it costs less.

We also voted in Babis and his ANO, and while I did not vote for him personally, I respect the democratic process that allowed people to do so. Many of his supporters have many shortcomings but one thing they do is that they complain about other parties and regions where those won, but they never dispute the fact that they won and don't try to put pressure on the locals for it. And neither will I. If the majority of the country wants those clowns in the government, go ahead, I don't and then maybe this country is not the country for me right now - not all countries need to follow the same rhetoric. People are free to move, or stay and change the local minds towards a vision of a country that they want. 

And in the end, Babis showed himself for who he is, and is expected to lose the next election, just as PiS might. But for now, both parties are in power, and are there legally.

It's always been the base of mindless nationalist propaganda and italy (as with many other countries in europe right now) is suffering from a big wave of populist rethoric.  
On the web, especially reddit, you will find people that say that it's ""just a meme""; it actually is for these people, something not really important but bad happens to the french like losing a football match? Time to make a little bit of fun off of them, they don't know and won't really care since it's all in good fun. The most common example here on reddit is seeing like a graph or a list about the % of something bad in each country in europe and if italy places better than france (while still being quite low) there will always be a comment along the lines of: ""the only thing that matters is that we beat france"". All banter, all jokes.  


This graph represents another type of resentment, it's not vitriolic hate or anything even close to that. You'd be VERY hard pressed to find an italian person that will actively avoid dealing with french people.  
What this truly represents is the pathetic inferiory complex of the average italian person who sees  these countries doing quite well compared to them, especially after last decades' terrible recession, and thinks that now everything they do on a diplomatic/european theatre is bad, stupid, mean and designed to exploit poor italian people.

It's not really an italian problem, it's a sad human reaction.   


If you asked italians about their opinion of greeks you'd find a completely different graph, I'm sure of it. Because they feel like they're on the same boat, especially southern italians. They feel like these rich countries are leaving them with scrap and before you say anything about how Italy is not even comparable to greece I will remind you that north and south are basically two different countries, the wealth of the north does not trickle down south, young people immigrate in droves to the north in search of a job since they're non existent down under.

Not possible. The most recent European projects are mired in cost overruns and delays. And that's just a single project, when trying a large scale buildout we'll inevitably run into industrial production bottlenecks for specialized equipment like reactor vessels, for educated and experienced personnel, and the rest of the supply chain, not least of which fissiles. That amount of fissiles needed to run all those plants until the end of their lifetime hasn't been discovered yet.

And even ignoring that it still means locking up gargantuan amounts of funding for the better part of a century. Which then has to solve everything or be written off as a loss.

Moreover, we'll still need the investments into storage, flexibility, etc. to match supply and demand. That doesn't really change, so it's not a one-stop solution.

 &gt;The English Armada, also known as the Counter Armada or the Drake–Norris Expedition, was an attack fleet sent against Spain by Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1589 during the undeclared Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) and the Eighty Years' War. Led by Sir Francis Drake as admiral and Sir John Norreys as general, it failed to drive home the advantage that England had won upon the failure of the Spanish Armada in the previous year. The Spanish victory marked a revival of Philip II's naval power through the next decade.
 
**[Battle_of_Cartagena_de_Indias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cartagena_de_Indias)** 
 
 &gt;The Battle of Cartagena de Indias took place during the 1739 to 1748 War of Jenkins' Ear between Spain and Britain. The result of long-standing commercial tensions, the war was primarily fought in the Caribbean; the British tried to capture key Spanish ports in the region, including Porto Bello and Chagres in Panama, Havana, and Cartagena de Indias in present-day Colombia. Two previous naval attacks failed in 1740, while the third attempt in March 1741 was a combined naval and ground assault. The British were forced to retreat, having lost over 9,500–11,500 men, the majority from yellow fever; some units suffered death rates of 80 to 90 per cent.

The vaccines will be transported to Denmark ""as quickly as possible"" according to him on Twitter.



In a press release from the ministry of health the first dosages might be in Denmark in during this week. 



But the planning of both packing and transport is still an ongoing process at SSI (Danish CDC equivalent). They will be delivered by plane over 3-4 flights.  



The purchase of the vaccines means that there will be an entire new vaccine kalender. Because with all the extra vaccines the last groups will be offered a vaccine much quicker.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/oasib8/health_minister_heunicke_confirms_denmark_to_buy/h3jdrap/,Lichbingeking,1625040153

1327,"With further and further personal identification, which is empowering, it has only been used to divide each other. Everyone seeks to see how we are different, though for personal empowerment reasons, it doesnt solve problems together. My partner is a black woman. She consider intersectionality. Mainly because original feminism did not include the fight for her rights, or her mothers rights as black women. However, the women of the time black or white had the same issues. Sure black women more issues related to race, just ad black men. But excluding black women from the fight for womens rights does not help the cause for wkens rights. As a matter of fact it excludes solutions and ideas that would help the cause. 

I am a australian born, vietnamese male. To be modern dayb specific cisgender, heterosexual, 2nd generation asian refugee. I could if I wished choose any if those titles to fall into and start being intersectional with any person i come across. 

For one I could be oppressive to any white person in my opinion. Because apparently white people have ALL had it easier than me (not true) by playing the POC role.

 I could do the same to most Australians and argue privilege by playing the 2nd gen refugee role. (Obviously not indigenous australians) 

But then a LGBT person could offside my opinion because I have not gone through the struggles they have growing up. 

Thing is I dont do that. MLK said dont judge someone on the color of their skin but content of their character. 

Today we need to understand not color of skin, sexual orientation, nativity, gender or sex, but content of character. 

Certain personal identifications divide us when we are fighting the same fight for rights. 

I dont push to mention all the classifications you could put me into. I am a person. Trying to learn and fight for everyones autonomy and existence. Not just men, not just vietnamese, not just immigrants and refugees, not just cisgendered, not just hetero. 

The fight for rights as autonomous humans is the fight for rights as autonomous humans. That's it. It doesnt matter what classification you give yourself. If you dont enjoy the same rights as me. Then I want to help figure out how we get them for you. But if you say to me. I will never understand because I'm a viet, aus, cis, hetero, cismale. But you're a viet, aus, cis, gay male.

Hm? You do not see how certain parties would not want to lessen the restrictions on eastern European countries especially when it comes to something like Schengen? What?

&gt;It's not. Why do people have such a hard time understanding that. What we had to achieve were EU minimum requirements. To have a roadmap... It really, really, does not depend on the EU to let us in or not in Schengen.

Again, its you who has hard time understanding what EU is. Its specifically set up so this kind of bilateral ""YES,NO,MAYBE"" is not prevalent. 

&gt;Do you not understand what Schengen is?

Given that I am a EU citizen, Yes I do.

&gt;And please tell me, how would we extort the Dutch.. What could the dutch want from us? Are we not the ones wanting in Schengen, are we not the ones gaining from it?

Do you believe the only issue in the world is Schengen? No, there are current and future issues where Dutch initiatives could get blocked.

You can prostitute yourself, your family and your country in hopes that somebody will trust you but you fundamentally must know that its the trust that you need. There is currently no reason to believe that is the case.

Initially signed by China and the Soviet Union, the terms of the agreement were resumed by Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The treaty resulted in some minor territorial changes along the border.

If you really do believe in what Jesus taught, I would challenge you to step back and evaluate what the church is actually doing, not just what they are preaching.

There are denominations out there that are much more moderate, which based on what you are saying, may line up more with your personal beliefs.

 &gt;The Kingdom of Germany or German Kingdom (Latin: regnum Teutonicorum ""Kingdom of the Germans"", regnum Teutonicum ""German Kingdom"", regnum Alamanie) was the mostly Germanic-speaking Eastern Frankish kingdom, which was formed by the Treaty of Verdun in 843, especially after the kingship passed from Frankish kings to the Saxon Ottonian dynasty in 919. The king was elected, initially by the rulers of the stem duchies, who generally chose one of their own. After 962, when Otto I was crowned emperor, East Francia formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire, which also included the Kingdom of Italy and, after 1032, the Kingdom of Burgundy.

Okay, but even so, I'm fairly tolerant and I'm only *moderately* leftist so I'm fine with Catholics being Catholics, praying to their god and doing their weird cannibalistic rituals as long as they do it in their own homes.

They shouldn't go on the streets wearing their crosses on their necks and hosting parades to celebrate their weird ideology. It's an insult to our European tradition of logic and reason, dating back as far as to Ancient Greece! And as if doing that wasn't enough, they are making children go to their churches. That's outrageous! Children definitely should stay away from Catholicism, as it may damage their development.

Yes, go on, call me a religiophobe. But you'll see that I'll be one that was right when the Western Civilization collapses in a few decades because of Catholicism.

2022,"&gt;And thats our main divergence I believe.

Understandable. A one-rule-fits-all systems feel more elegant and ""correct"", but as an engineer I prefer to be pragmatic. People are notoriously hard to fit into systems.

&gt;What if your culture and religion dictates that women are not to be superior to men and women not wearing such vestments are property not yet owned ?

In such a situation, the question of whether or not a hijab should be allowed to be worn in a secular office would be insignificant when compared to other issues in societies 😉

&gt;If we have the need for ""positive discrimination"" then we have bigger issues we need to fix.

I'm not fond of positive discrimination myself. That said, in this case I think it corrects a very real problem that has no real alternative solution other than segregation.

In a way it's similar to the problem countries ran into when gay marriage was legalized and religious civic servants didn't want to officiate weddings for same-sex couples. Generally two options were chosen; either those civic servants were fired and replaced with more willing civic servants, or they were accommodated by having colleagues without religious objections officiate those weddings.

Personally I favor the latter option. While that creates an exception that does not jam 100% with the notion of a secular civic servant, when given a choice I do prefer to protect the freedoms of as many people as possible.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/o9rcd5/istanbul_pride_2021/h3gaa4l/,Dicebar,1624982383

A good example is the recent child grooming (rape) gangs. Adults groomed children to such a degree that the children would swear blind they were in love and consented even as they were passed around dozens of old men.

Other than that they're almost independent states. 

If Moldova and Wallachia were part of the Ottoman empire, the Sultan could have brought in settlers/colonists (Turks, Syrians, Egyptians, whatever he wished); the Romanians would have been forced to send their children into the Janissaries (a specialist part of the Ottoman army); the Romanians would have faced intensive discrimination based on their religion and forced to convert to Islam, like it happened with Albanians for example.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/o9i3kq/map_of_europe_if_google_maps_existed_in_the_year/h3fu6va/,George97o,1624975063

2116,"&gt;The point of my post is to reflect in general about real data on plastics pollution, and not just speculations and false myths.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some thoughts could be:  
&gt;  
&gt;1 Is it relevant to ban products in UE when the rest of the World (&gt;99%) will go on polluting the same way? We should help other countries and impose regulations internationally in international organizations 
&gt;
&gt;2 Are we sure that the solution we'll use to substitute the banned items are more environmentally friendly?

To be fair, you also wrote stuff like this:

&gt;My point was start a conversation and reflect on this topic thatshouldn't be a simple ""plastic is bad, let's ban it"". Banning single use plastics is one of the possibilities, the easiest I must say. We could instead try making people more responsible and teach recycling. For sure stop exporting in Third World Countries. My concern is if the alternatives we propose are actually more environmentally friendly based on life cycle assessment data. Most people here thought I was just pointing fingers to other countries, so my idea to make a useful conversation was unfortunately limited by this.

You should instead make a reason- and evidence-based argument instead of posting outdated and misleading charts to write it off as pointless. Those are some fair questions, but they hardly seem to be honest when you seem to be trying to say this ban is ridiculous. It seems to be more of an attempt to make people doubt in this ban is instead of asking legitimate questions and actually discussion the pros and cons of such decisions.",Polish People's Republic,/r/europe/comments/oa3rxz/ue_bans_single_use_plastics_to_protect_the/h3fu9gy/,Comrade_NB,1624975098

The list of articles I posted showing the media falling for this 4chan troll? Officially categorising this as a hate symbol?

&gt;Why are you so eager to misrepresent the number of leftists and the number of fascists?

It was literally started by 1 guy on 4chan. The ADL, CNN, BBC, etc. etc. have a reach of billions. If anything I was conservative in the opposite direction.

&gt;Why the scare quotations around the latter word?

Because trolls on 4chan are not fascists, they're anarchical trolls.

&gt;Why the eagerness to blame leftists in general

Because they're supposed to fight ""fascists"", not completely capitulate to them.

I am a student, wanting to get my work out. New account yes.

My purpose was to summarise and analyse the unusual setting Orban found himself in, an interview in front of a foreign press.

I am not Hungarian and wish to give an outsiders perspective on this man, his goals an aims. Though I admit to having strong connections to Hungarian communities which has assisted in my research and understanding of Hungarian politics.

It is not my business to push an anti-Orban agenda despite my understanding of various discrepancies between Orbans actions and words. 

I was hoping the academic and objective reality presented in this piece was clear for all to see.

All reference links are valid as far as I am aware.

If you turn to page 17 of today's Jyllands-Posten, you will be able to see a full-page advertisement from Hungary's EU-critical Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán.  
  
In the advertisement, Orbán sets out seven proposals - in Danish - ""for the future of the European Union"".  
  
\- In Brussels, a superstate is being built for which no one has given permission. We say no to the European Empire, is the first proposal.  
  
Orbán writes in the ad that he would like Serbia to join the EU, calling the European Parliament a ""dead end"", and then stating that European integration ""is a means, not an end in itself"".  
  
The ad is marked by grammatical errors and typos such as *beslutinger* (beslutninger) and *europæsike* (europæiske).  
  
Hungary has been criticized by other EU leaders for, among other things, the adoption of a controversial LGBT law. The Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, has said that Hungary no longer belongs to the EU, and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called the law a ""disgrace"".

It doesn’t speak for itself so I guess opportunistic political movements across Europe decided to speak for it by interjecting whatever the relevant boogeyman narrative they require to further their own political agendas.

Forcefully? haven't noticed that Europeans go into Africa to abduct these people to bring them here (at least not within the last few centuries). Saving people and following international law to grant assylum is NOT forcefully installing. That kind of rethoric is attempting to negate the issues how people actually come here by creating a false narrative about state issues taking them in, instead of nations trying to cope with people comming and having to deal how to work this out.

&gt; We can, and we should, stop people from drowning and try to treat them as humanly as possible. But allowing them to live in Europe, just because? It hasn't worked. And I think most EU governments are realising that, yours in the first place.

The issue is, as soon as you stop them from drowning, it is the problem of the nationality of the ship to deal with how to get them back. For that, there is international law, which is a slow and difficult process. But we cannot just simply forcefully commit acts of war by entering with national boats into foreign waters to drop them refugees.

2380,"Believing that corporate tax does anything to crush inequality is illiteracy.

It does the opposite: it increases it because, once again, it's highly regressive.

Rich shareholders don't pay the corporate tax. The incidence falls to a large extent upon workers, via lower wages. The part that falls upon 

Then again, ""incidence"" in itself is a concept lots of people fall to understand - they're genuinely convinced it's ""corporations"" paying the tax and don't understand that simply isn't a thing - in the end, the money needs to come from someone - either from shareholders via lower profits or workers via lower wages.

To the extent shareholders pay the corporate tax, it's highly regressive because it's the same tax rate for everryone: a poor widow that holds some savings in stock and Jeff Bezos. 

Anyone who wants to crush inequality should defend abolishing the corporate tax and replace it with higherm, and progressive, taxation on dividends - tax the actual rich people, not legal fiction like corporations.

2390,"Apparently in 2020 the EU adopted new rules regarding plastic waste [1].

&gt;These new rules send a clear message that in the EU we are taking   
responsibility for the waste we generate. The export of plastic waste   
will only be allowed under very strict conditions. The export of   
unsorted plastic waste to non-OECD countries will be completely banned.   
This is an important milestone in fighting plastic   
pollution, transitioning shifting to a circular economy, and achieving   
the aims of the European Green Deal.

The graph above refers to 2015, so if EU had to make rules it means that we were actually sending waste to non-OECD countries... and more likely China just doesn't want our waste anymore. Also having a rule doesn't mean that it will be respected.

This unfortunately leads to an increase of incineration and landfilling because EU is not ready to actively and extensively recycle [2]:

&gt;EU exports of plastic waste to countries outside the EU amounted to around 150 000 tonnes per month at the start of 2019. [...] As a result of the import restrictions in China, the amount of plastic waste exported to China and Hong Kong has become very limited, and exports have shifted to other destinations.

And also

&gt;The trend in decreasing exports of plastic waste is likely to result in an increase in incineration and landfilling in the short term, because of the current lack of capacity to increase recycling and reuse in the EU.

2462,"That is never the majority. Political crimes are always a minority, but in a country with tensions like that, there must be a wave of petty criminals, who are the first sign of a sick system, before activists get jailed who try to change that said system. 

In any case, to let out those petty criminals with amnesty is not a solution because they keep terrorizing neighborhoods. If the government is incapable of preventing crimes, at least they should lock away dangerous people.

I know that crime is caused by unfavorable circumstances: poverty, lack of education, violent culture,etc... but that doesn't mean that you just let out people because we are so empathetic. I don't like SJW progressives and these pseudo-intellectual humanists who live in gated communities and teach us regular folks to be more tolerant of rapists and muggers because they had a rough childhood while they are totally isolated from all the negative effects. I know that its not nice for the slaves to fight betwen eachother while the masters get away, but I also can't tolerate being agressed for no reason and have to live in fear because the government is incapable of restoring order. Whatever social problems there are, the number one priority is always order.

Furthermore those stations are privately owned and not really that controlled. If one wanted to and were the owner of multiple test stations, they could deliberately screw with the statistics. 
As recent events have shown, some actually do. Not by artificially inflating cases, but by scaling the government for money.

2633,"A casus belli ('occasion for war') is an act or event that provokes or is used to justify war. A casus belli involves direct offenses or threats against the nation declaring the war, whereas a casus foederis involves offenses or threats against its ally—usually one bound by a mutual defense pact. Either may be considered an act of war.

The term came into wide use in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries through the writings of Hugo Grotius (1653), Cornelius van Bynkershoek (1707), and Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui (1732), among others, and due to the rise of the political doctrine of jus ad bellum or ""just war theory"". The term is also used informally to refer to any ""just cause"" a nation may claim for entering into a conflict. It is used retrospectively to describe situations that arose before the term came into wide use, as well as present-day situations, including those in which war has not been formally declared.

In formally articulating a casus belli, a government typically lays out its reasons for going to war, its intended means of prosecuting the war, and the steps that others might take to dissuade it from going to war. It attempts to demonstrate that it is going to war only as a last resort (ultima ratio) and that it has ""just cause"" for doing so. Modern international law recognizes only three lawful justifications for waging war: self-defense, defense of an ally required by the terms of a treaty, and approval by the United Nations [dubious – discuss].

Proschema (plural proschemata) is the equivalent Greek term, first popularized by Thucydides in his History of the Peloponnesian War. The proschemata are the stated reasons for waging war, which may or may not be the same as the real reasons, which Thucydides called prophasis (πρóφασις). Thucydides argued that the three primary real reasons for waging war are reasonable fear, honor, and interest, while the stated reasons involve appeals to nationalism or fearmongering (as opposed to descriptions of reasonable, empirical causes for fear).",,/r/europe/comments/o9dcx7/on_this_day_in_1914_the_archduke_franz_ferdinand/h3eknoo/,Odd-Profit-3791,1624940081

Description	
English: The original cartoon was published in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, in 1912 (4th December) and by the title ""A threatening situation"". It was drawn by Nelson Harding and published again in The World's War Cartoons (Blood and Iron). The Balkans in Caricature, ed. by T. D. Hadjich, London: Cecil Palmer &amp; Hayward, 1916, p. 29 (online at State Library Victoria: http://digital.slv.vic.gov.au/view/action/singleViewer.do?dvs=1539686002409~477&amp;locale=de&amp;metadata_object_ratio=10&amp;show_metadata=true&amp;VIEWER_URL=/view/action/singleViewer.do?&amp;preferred_usage_type=VIEW_MAIN&amp;DELIVERY_RULE_ID=10&amp;frameId=1&amp;usePid1=true&amp;usePid2=true). There it is explained as follows: ""Serbia, having captured a port on the Adriatic, is threatened by Austria, who sees in the capture a gain for Russia. Russia promptly comes to the protection of Serbia and threatens Austria, whereupon Germany rushes to Austria’s protection and threatens Russia, and so on down the line."" In the WWW it is often found unter the title of ""The Chain of Friendship"" and interpreted as depicting the web of alliances of WWI, since it also depicts the diplomatic situation of Europe in July 1914.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/o9o897/a_threatening_situation_an_american_comic_from/h3e8gsx/,gimjun,1624933325

A) Thank you for giving me some of your background. It’s nice to know that your not a basement dwelling ignoramus like 90% of people who comment here. 

B) I’m not from Russia. I was born in the UK and grew up in a military family. For half of my life I “knew” that everything in Russia was evil, everyone was poor and their world was grey. 

I’m very well traveled. My oilfield job had me living and working in a number of countries including Canada, the US, the Middle East and Australia. 

However I was very apprehensive about being sent to Russia because of all the awful things I’d heard about the place. But it took about a day there to realise I’d been lied to all my life. 

The “enemy” was completely normal. The place was nice, the shops were full and people were friendly, funny and happy. 

Sure it has some problems. What country doesn’t? But there are plenty of good things about the place.

**Covid-19 news**

- New covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths are still decreasing. The two friendly matches (in front of 10k spectators agaisnt Cyprus on the 4th and 7k against Ireland on the 8th) of the Hungarian football team and the first Euro match (with 56k in attendance against Portugal on the 15th) haven't had any effect on infections so far.

- As of Friday morning, 5.47M people (56.6%) have received a Covid vaccine and 4.84M (50.1%) are fully vaccinated.

- The government announced the lifting of more restrictions, conditional on achieving 5.5M first vaccinations, which we can reach in a matter of days. Masks will no longer be mandatory indoors where vaccinated and non-vaccinated people can mix.

**Euro 2020**

- On Wednesday, Hungary played its last group stage match against Germany in Munich. The match ended in a 2-2 draw, which meant we finished last in Group F. Before the match, UEFA had rejected a request to light Allianze Arena in rainbow colours to protest the paedophile/LGBTQ 'propaganda' bill passed by the Hungarian Parliament earlier this month. Many buildings in Munich still displayed the flag, and a man with a rainbow flag invaded the pitch during the Hungarian anthem. Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó called the presence of the flags 'political provocation' and alleged that the invader was deliberately let onto the pitch by stadium staff (note that pitch invasions occurred in all three group stage matches held in Budapest).

- There was also bad behaviour exhibited by some Hungarian fans. Before and during the match against Germany, [Bavarian police detained 18 Hungarians](https://hungarytoday.hu/hungarian-supporters-munich-fans-detained/) for different offences – including possession of fireworks, homophobic chants and disorderly conduct inside the stadium. During the France-Portugal match held at the same time in Budapest, two people with rainbow face paints were assaulted and spat on. By Sunday, police arrested two Hungarians, father and son, for the assault and they were charged with public nuisance.

- PM Viktor Orbán was supposed to be at the match in Munich, but he cancelled the trip at the last minute (probably due to the rainbow flag controversy) and instead flew to Brussels a day early to have dinner with Giorgia Meloni, leader of the right-wing Brothers of Italy party.

**EU summit and reactions to 'The Bill'**

- Thursday's European Council meeting saw heated discussions of Hungary's new paedophilia/LGBTQ 'propaganda' law. PM Bettel of Luxembourg recounted his personal struggles with his gay identity during his teenage years. PM Rutte of the Netherlands criticised the law and suggested that Hungary has no place in the EU with such a law and that Orbán should invoke Article 50 to leave the EU.

- Justice Minister Judit Varga called Rutte's comments 'political blackmailing' and referred to him as a 'coloniser' who had 'written himself off the circle of civilised people'. [Varga also claimed](https://abouthungary.hu/blog/censored-heres-the-op-ed-on-hungarys-law-on-sex-ed-by-moj-judit-varga-that-politico-europe-refused-to-publish) that 'the focus of the law is the protection of children from any kind of sexuality' *(which is untrue, as 'promotion' of heterosexuality isn't mentioned by the law, unlike homosexuality, sex change and non-conforming gender identity, topics which minors now mustn't know about)*.

- Orbán [also said](https://hungarytoday.hu/hungary-homosexuality-anti-pedophilia-bill-orban/) before the summit that 'he is a freedom fighter' who fought for the freedom and rights of homosexuals during the communist regime when 'homosexuality was punished' *(this is a lie, as consensual same-sex relations have been legal since 1962, the year before Orbán was born)* and claimed that only parents could choose what kind of sexual upbringing their children should get.

- Nevertheless, on Friday, President János Áder signed the bill into law, repeating a claim also made by Orbán that 'homosexual adults aren't affected by the law'.

**Other news**

- Back on 19 June, the day of Hungarian independence (remmebering the 30th anniversary of the last Soviet soldier leaving the country) PM Viktor Orbán outlined his vision for the reformation of the EU. Orbán claimed that European integration is 'not an end but the means' to economic prosperity, that 'Brussels' wants to build a superstate which 'no one authorised' and must be resisted, along with mass migration and epidemics. He also called for the admission of Serbia and the abolition of the European Parliament and handing more power to national legislatures. Over the weekend, Orbán's seven points, now titled as 'Hungary's proposal', [were published as full-page advertisements](https://hungarytoday.hu/orban-outlines-eu-vision-ads-foreign-papers/) in several European newspapers including Denmark's Jyllands-Posten and the Spanish ABC. Some outlets, including Belgium's De Morgen, refused to publish the 'manifesto', instead criticising it and its timing in an editorial.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/o8ryp4/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20210627/h3ds21s/,dickblaha,1624924762

For anyone who's wondering, besides some geopolitical reasons, the fact that the Pianura Padana was a very fertile ground for industrialization also played a major role in that. It's a flatland with dozens of rivers, and back then it had more resources to offer for the economical development that they were going for. Which meant building more industrial cities, railways (please check out a map of the Italian railway system if you're interested) and commercial hubs.

2906,"&gt;I am kind of curious what you think the general feeling is in the UK about Coronavirus at this point in time?

I would say, pretty relaxed now. Everyone who's remotely at risk has been vaccinated and they kinda see that as being ""as good as it gets"". I kinda get the feeling that people are resigned to having to fight covid at some point, but feel that with the vaccine they're given the best chance they'll ever have.

&gt;Are people still strictly following restrictions?

There are fairly few restrictions now. I'd say that before the 12th of April (when pubs opened *outdoors*) people were being fairly strict. Naturally after the beer gardens opened I did end up going round to friends houses after the pubs close... As of May there's still meant to be a rule-of-six indoors, but I've personally broken that with a few friends for a wedding and a couple of gatherings. Still wearing masks though and I don't see that changing immediately when things are relaxed further.

&gt;No pubs being open etc?

They're open and absolutely booming. It's pretty hard to get a table in some city centre locations on Saturdays. I don't think that will get easier until they allow vertical drinking again. Still, I've been to a lot of pubs.

&gt;Do you think because of this delta variant and new vaeiants there could possibly be restrictions for another year or longer?

Nah. No more than the USA or anywhere else. Everyone's getting vaccinated. Vaccines seem to be *good enough* and there will be a booster program ready to roll out in the autumn.

&gt;I will admit my question is a bit selfish in nature because I have always wanted to visit the United Kingdom.

Nah, we want to travel too. We're all dying to burn to crisps on the Spanish coast. Just obviously check what restrictions apply to you and remember that there can be differences between England and the devolved administrations (though I *think* they're mostly coordinated now). So if you want to visit Wales, NI or Scotland, check those separately! The main gov.uk red/amber/green lists are for England only.

3019,"&gt;First, at that time Serbia was a monarchy aswell.

And? I have no love for neither the Obrenovic nor Karadjordjevic dynasty, nor any monarchy which doesn't enjoy popular, democratic support.

&gt;Second, A-H (at least the Austrian part) had a parliamentary Monarchy.

And? Did Bosnia or Vojvodina have any say in it? Any representatives? Any way to tell the archduke to fuck off, should they choose to do so?

&gt;Third, by that logic you would also make an argument for harming the Queen of England.

**Exactly.** If the Queen of England would oppose any attempts to get dethroned, if she would hunt down and murder her opposition, she would be a prime and a just target for getting assassinated herself. This is not terrorism, that is self defence. What she would be doing is terrorism. If the Queen of England would impose her rule by force against the will of the people, I would have no issues with her getting assassinated and would support such a cause.

But she doesn't. She is a nice lady and she has a majority support. If she didn't have it, there would be a referendum about the UK becoming a republic and she would support that decision and step down. Their system works.

3072,"Okay get this. The European Council is nominating the president of the European Commission. The council is made up of **fuckin heads of member states** so your own representative - your prime minister took part in choosing von der leyen. This may not be direct election but it is pretty much exactly the same as choosing the president of the US only difference being the president of the EC has not even close the amount of power the POTUS has.

Anyway if that isn’t enough for you the EP which surely has your representatives in it (all 21 of the to be exact) can vote against.

So clearly you have several representatives to express your views for you - and in fact you as a Swede are far better represented as an individual than a German or a Frenchman would.  In the European Council you have 1 representative to represent your 2% of the EU population while Germany has 1 to represent all of the 18% of the European population. In the parliament it’s a similar deal although less apparent (96 to 21).

And I don’t know where your idea of democracy comes from but I have never seen a system I would call democratic that gives any one the power to vote somebody out. And given that by the looks of it you are in a minority in the Swedish political spectrum I highly doubt you would like such a system. You have no right to deny Germany to be represented by the likes of Von Der Leyen. Plain and simple. And nobody fuckin cares how you feel about her. Likewise no German can deny you to be represented by somebody who you like. If that were the case I’d love to see the rest of EU voting Orban out.

And if my “rant” wasn’t clear to you - if you don’t like the EU go vote for a representative who will get your country to leave. It’s that simple. The UK could do it so can you - however if other Swedes don’t share your dislike that’s your problem not EU’s.

The same goes for Hungarians. But they won’t because they benefit to much and you don’t have to look far to see how satellite countries get treated - see Belarus.

3095,"&gt;Cmon, Portugal is not THAT bad. In all seriousness though,

Problem is not about Portugal being bad. Yes they're Portuguese because East Timor was a colony until 1999 but these immigrants most likely speak they're native language - tetum - since Portuguese was frowned upon during the invasion by Indonesia.

This is unfortunately very common with Portuguese from our ex- colonies (not just in the UK). To give you an example, I have several friends living in the UK, when they go to the Portuguese consulate to get their ID renewed, or something else, my friends, as portuguese do, try to chat with people there while waiting in line. Every single time they start a conversation at least half of them end because the person can't speak Portuguese and/ or English. 

As someone who had grandparents who where immigrants in countries where portuguese was not the language who did learn the language, even the local language, it befuddles me. Heck, my other grandparents visited uncles in England in the late  1970s for over a month and they come back knowing full sentences. ( My grandmother loved saying ' Rubbish' lmao)

 It completely baffles me someone with such an opportunity to improve in life just choses not to learn the language - because not knowing what is going on and not knowing the language after so long one has to have chosen not to learn.",,/r/europe/comments/o9i9pv/uks_east_timorese_population_faces_loss_of_rights/h3cy541/,1purplesky,1624910850

Countries can become both rich and authoritarian too, and the liberal defenders of democracy claim not liking the latter. It is after all them defining what authoritarianism is...

Each country's political system has its own agenda, issues to deal with and needs.

Not that the Wagner PMC can't involve in such thighs, ofcourse they do. Those guys have no breaks.

These latest accusations are actually a result of ongoing UN investigation. Nowhere is it said they come from witnesses only. It actually says""*Violations by the Russians and allied government troops “included cases of excessive force, indiscriminate killings, occupation of schools and looting on a large scale, including of humanitarian organizations,” said the investigative report, which was based on photographic evidence and confidential accounts by witnesses and local officials.*

Witnesses subject to investigation aren't just plain asserting things either, they are cross examined and so on.

&gt;There was a time when we surrendered to the west and became bootlickers - it was the 90s. It was the worst time to an average russian. Not only we became poor as fuck, even compared to the worst soviet deficits. We became essentialy ""nothing"" on the world stage. Thus we learned a lesson - we would never be loved or endorced anyways, so we'll be feared and respected out of neccessity. It kind of played out. While our influence and importance is still miniscule(we are a tiny 2% of the world's GDP) - we are at least a notion to consider.  
&gt;  
&gt;And it is not just a question of ""restoring the former glory"", but first and foremost - the question of national security.

&amp;#x200B;

There is no way to say this that would make you empathise with what I'm going to say. But I feel like I have to try to somehow communicate this regardless. Are war crimes the way by which you want your country to enter into consideration?

&gt;Yet again, a liberal worldview does not recognize our motivation as rational. The world is a ""positive-sum game"", ""liberal democracy is the best way to govern"", ""western expansion is a mutual benefit"", etc. Not going to argue with that, it is the question of fundamental values.

3186,"&gt;Hopes have been raised of summer holidays in Europe for fully vaccinated Britons as a deal with Brussels on Covid passports neared completion and Germany failed to convince popular destinations to pull an “emergency brake” on UK visitors.

&gt;Restrictions on travel are tightening across the continent for tourists coming from the UK who have not had two jabs, owing to concerns over the highly transmissible Delta variant now dominant in Britain.

&gt;Portugal announced on Monday that people unable to prove full vaccination status would face 14 days in quarantine. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said Britons travelling to the Balearic islands would need to show either a negative PCR test or proof that they have been fully vaccinated to avoid having to self-isolate. From Wednesday, the Balearics will be on the UK government’s green list of countries from which travellers will not need to quarantine when they return home.

&gt;But for travellers from the UK who have had both doses of an approved vaccine, the prospect of a relatively normal summer break appears brighter, with popular destinations loth to shut the doors on those who are unlikely to be infectious. According to the latest data, 61.9% of UK adults are now fully vaccinated and 84.4% have had at least a first dose.

&gt;The German government, which has enforced a 14-day quarantine on all tourists from Britain since 26 May, is yet to convince countries more dependent on tourism that stringent quarantine requirements on all travellers from the UK are necessary.

&gt;The prospects for the fully vaccinated appeared all the better on Monday as it emerged that talks were advancing well on the mutual recognition of an NHS app and the EU’s green digital certificate ensuring that travellers can prove their status.

&gt;The apps allow border controls to scan a QR code to confirm the vaccination status of the traveller and provide free passage. A European Commission spokesperson said: “There are talks ongoing at the technical level which are progressing well and going in the right direction. This is particularly because the technical system architecture of the EU and the UK are aligned.

&gt;“The talks are ongoing – I have no specific timeline to announce. It’s good that the UK is now working with us towards that goal.”

&gt;A UK government spokesperson said unlocking international travel was “vitally important” and that officials were seeking to “ensure certification is introduced in a way that works for everyone”.

&gt;There are concerns in the UK government that a two-tier system is emerging in which those who are unvaccinated face a disadvantage in trying to get away for a holiday, but owing to the spread of the Delta variant, that outcome appears unavoidable.

&gt;At a meeting of a group of EU diplomats coordinating the union’s integrated political crisis response on Monday, a briefing from the bloc’s disease prevention and control agency noted the highly transmissible nature of the Delta variant. Diplomats were told that the variant would probably account for 90% of cases by the end of August.

&gt;The rate of vaccination, however, offers hope that the link between infection and hospitalisation and deaths will be broken in time. Diplomatic sources said it was likely that the level of infection would in future not be the key factor in deciding whether non-essential travel from the UK or elsewhere by the unvaccinated is permitted.

&gt;Sources said the German representative at the meeting said Berlin would be tightening its policy on UK travellers. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, warned fellow leaders at a summit last week that the bloc was “not doing well” in relation to restricting the spread of variants found in non-EU countries.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/o9psox/uk_and_brussels_near_deal_on_covid_passports_to/h3chcov/,blueeyesviking,1624903589

The Delta variant didn't emerge in the UK, it (most likely) emerged in India. That Delta is now at ~95% in the UK and at ~15% in Germany isn't because the UK is sequencing more.

Finally, you don't need to do that much sequencing to detect new variants relatively early. Even with 1000 sequenced genomes, you can already spot a variant at 1% prevalence with a fairly high degree of certainty. The 95% CI for the number of hits on a variant with 1% prevalence when you do 1000 tests is [4, 16].

The high level of sequencing in the UK is great for very early detection of variants and in pinning down their emergence to a specific part of the country.

Quite right, so it's important to use statistics and not our intuition or feelings. South Africans don't pose nearly as much a social threat as, for example, Nigerians.

Even if we assume Russia/Gazprom will follow the rules when its about CEE (they dont have the best track record with that), the alternate pipelines have a limited capacity, NS1+NS2+Turkstream capacity is less than the pipelines going through Ukraine. If Russia stops using the pipeline through Ukraine, suddenly there isnt much space for surpluses and refilling storages.

If you have symptoms or a positive antigen test you're going to get tested with a PCR-Test.

I think that the law itself is being overblown (gay characters can be shown after watershed- again very much the case in much of the rest of Europe until comparatively recently, and again, good luck defining who’s gay and who’s not) but that there’s no case to be made against Hungary on EU terms, precisely because the only thing that has changed since 2004 is western norms and interpretations, not the wording of the treaties Hungary signed up to, which by all accounts the law has stayed on side of. (It doesn’t directly compare homosexuality and paedophilia as I understand it, the clause is merely attached to a bill on paedophilia, this clouding the issue and to an extent deliberately connecting the two).

As I said before, this is about politicians playing to their bases, not much more. But it’s a really bad look to have the rich core countries telling the poorer eastern ones what laws they can pass about what gets shown on TV pre-watershed or what kids books libraries should stock imo.

It depends. Maybe the grandfathers are still alive? Maybe what was stolen was very valuable on personal level, and Germans refuse to give it back? Maybe they forgot to acknowledge what happened to those families? It's not difficult to show up, once in 80 years, and say ""I'm sorry""? 

&gt; NOPE, keep in mind that it is possible to have friendtly relations with another country and still criticise them for something, for example I thing that NS 2 is a bad thing, but that doesnt make me  hate Germany.

Per the Berlin Treaty Bosnia was an “Independent” state and you are correct in saying this Independance  was not wholly respected.

Serbia was also viewed as a de facto proxy for Russia due to Russia’s close connection to the Serbian separatist movements that led to Serbian independence from Ottoman dominion.

&gt; russia doesn’t need carrier doctrine… And in my opinions opinion russia doesn’t need them.

No offence, but I’ll take this people’s thoughts over yours: 

&gt;  In mid-2007, the new Navy chief announced plans to reform the country's naval forces and build a blue-water navy with the world's second largest fleet of aircraft carriers, aiming to create 6 aircraft carrier strike groups in the next 20 years.

http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20071113/87843710.html

&gt; Speaking in Saint Petersburg on 30 June 2011, the head of United Shipbuilding Corporation, a Russian state holding company, said his company expected to begin design work for a new carrier in 2016, with a goal of beginning construction in 2018 and having the carrier achieve initial operational capability by 2023.

http://en.rian.ru/mlitary_news/20110630/164924604.html

&gt; Several months later, on 3 November 2011 the Russian newspaper Izvestiya reported the naval building plan now included (first) the construction of a new shipyard capable of building large hull ships, after which Moscow will build four nuclear-powered aircraft carriers by 2023.

https://web.archive.org/web/20120406191508/http://www.barentsobserver.com/russia-to-build-two-aircraft-carriers.4980466-58932.html

[And just recently they’ve have announced that the shit aircraft carrier that sets itself on fire will be rejoining the fleet - so its clear they see a use for aircraft carriers and want to incorporate that into their doctrine](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2021/06/russian-aircraft-carrier-to-rejoin-the-fleet-in-late-2023/).

3569,"&gt; When liberal ideas and resistance amongst the Chinese grew stronger and stronger

Enormously unlikely for reasons that are too long to go into but the tl;dr is that Chinese people massively support their government chiefly for bringing them out of the darkness of the century of humiliation and astronomically improving the material wealth of China. And out of disdain for this sort of Western 'arrogance' that they need any sort of 'liberalization' which pretty obviously entails Westernization, cultural and economic subordination to the West under a different name. Which is their big cultural trauma in the first place. The US and EU are infinitely more likely to collapse due to internal division than China. Those two splitting into pieces within 70 years actually IS looking likely.

&gt; the Communist Party didn’t see any other way to keep in power then to fuel extreme nationalism

They don't need to fuel anything, the Chinese people have that part covered all by themselves for better or worse. Nationalism is a very double edged sword but China's issue is not a lack of it.

&gt; This was THE chance for the US to get rid of it’s only true competitor and so World War lll began.

No fucking chance, literally every decisionmaker involved knows that the only result for this is death for everyone. If you ever hear someone seriously talk about total war between China and US, you know they don't know what they're talking about. Right now they're playing the intelligence game where the US is trying to destabilize China from within and China is trying to coax other nations to their side instead of ours with trade deals because the biggest lesson learned by Communist states in the 20th century is that money is power. So economics is the head of China's spear and has been since at least Deng.

Subsequently, there was a referendum promised for the Lisbon treaty though the government reneged on that election promise and signed the UK up amongst great protest from the electorate.

The consistent behaviour by various UK Governments to stemroll ahead despite the lack of appetite for deeper integration is likely the major reason that, once the opportunity did present itself, the UK voted (just) to leave.

3642,"NAIROBI, Kenya — Russian mercenaries deployed in one of Africa’s most fragile countries killed civilians, looted homes and shot dead worshipers at a mosque during a major military operation earlier this year, United Nations investigators have found.

The accusations of atrocities are documented in a report for the U.N. Security Council that was obtained by The New York Times and that details abuses tied to the contentious Russian involvement in the Central African Republic, an impoverished yet mineral-rich country that has been locked in civil war for nearly a decade.

Russian mercenaries, deployed in the guise of unarmed military advisers, led government forces into battle during an offensive to oust rebels from several towns in January and February, the report found. And as well as committing abuses, the Russian operatives established themselves in the major mining centers of a country with large reserves of diamonds.

Violations by the Russians and allied government troops “included cases of excessive force, indiscriminate killings, occupation of schools and looting on a large scale, including of humanitarian organizations,” said the investigative report, which was based on photographic evidence and confidential accounts by witnesses and local officials.

The Central African Republic turned to Russia in 2017 to wrest control of its diamond trade from the rebels, and to help end a conflict that has killed thousands and displaced over a million people since 2012.

The Kremlin offered to send unarmed military trainers to help train the Central African Army in a mission blessed by the United Nations, which carved out an exception to the arms embargo on the Central African Republic in place since 2013.

But it quickly became clear that the Russian trainers were in fact armed mercenaries, and the operation has evolved into a thinly veiled effort to build influence and strike business deals for the Kremlin in Africa, including lucrative diamond deals, to the benefit of businessmen including a close confidant of President Vladimir V. Putin.

The Russians have become deeply enmeshed in Central African politics and security. Russian bodyguards protect President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, and a former Russian spy has served as his security adviser.

Although Russian officials say they have never had more than 550 trainers in the country, U.N. investigators found the figure was sometimes as high as 2,100 personnel.

Several of the companies that employ the trainers are tied to Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, who is close to Mr. Putin and was indicted in the United States in 2019 on charges of financing “information warfare” and disrupting the 2016 American election.

The abuses covered in the U.N. report, to be released this week, occurred during a period of tumult in the former French colony. In late December, a newly formed rebel alliance tried to disrupt elections, then launched a military offensive on the capital, Bangui, in an attempt to seize power.

The offensive failed, and in mid-January, the government began a sweeping counterattack that eventually ousted the rebels from several major towns. As part of that, witnesses told U.N. investigators that supposedly unarmed Russian trainers had led Central African troops into battle “as they advanced on different towns and villages.” Accusations of atrocities against civilians followed.

The rebels forcibly recruited child soldiers, attacked peacekeepers, looted aid groups and sexually assaulted women, according to the report.

In December, Russian security contractors opened fire on a truck as it approached a checkpoint in the city of Grimari, killing three civilians and wounding 15, investigators found.

Then in February, the Russians led government troops in an attack on the Takwa mosque in Bambari, where rebels had taken shelter among worshipers. At least six civilians were killed as Russians stormed the mosque, firing their weapons, the report said.

The report also documents the killing of five other civilians by Russian forces, including two disabled men, and accuses them of looting money, motorbikes and other valuables during house searches.

Russian officials deny that their forces fired on civilians or committed abuses. The coordinator of the Russian military mission in Bangui told investigators that the rebels had used the Takwa mosque as a firing position. But he denied that Russians had entered the building or fired on civilians.

In recent years Russian security contractors have appeared in other conflict-hit African countries, including Libya, Mozambique and South Sudan. Three Russians were killed in a military clash on the border between Chad and the Central African Republic in May.

This month 10 Russians were detained in northern Chad in an area where the government was battling rebels. One of the Russians told the Reuters news agency they were visiting the area, in the Sahara, to go sightseeing.

Mr. Prigozhin has previously been linked to mercenary operations in Africa through his ties with the Wagner Group, a private military company that has played a role in the war in Libya and Syria. The word Wagner has also become shorthand for Russian involvement in the Central African Republic, where companies with links to Mr. Prigozhin have deployed mercenaries and scored lucrative mining and logistics contracts.

In 2019, three Russian journalists were killed in the country while investigating Mr. Prigozhin’s links to the gold and diamond trade. The local authorities promised an investigation, but nobody has been arrested or prosecuted.

The U.N. report notes that “Russian instructors have established a presence in the country’s key mining centers,” but offers no further details. But in March, another United Nations body accused a company linked to Mr. Prigozhin of involvement in extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and torture.

In a letter to the director of Lobaye Invest, a Russian company in Bangui, the United Nations working group on the use of mercenaries wrote: “Private contractors were seen on several occasions to directly participate in hostilities, and even sustaining visible body harm, being wounded or killed.”

“Reports also suggest grave human rights abuses, including rape, summary execution, targeted killings, torture, forced disappearances, murder and other abuses,” by Russian personnel operating jointly with government soldiers, the group wrote.

As the Russians pushed deeper into the Central African Republic, they have also mounted a concerted propaganda campaign to gain public favor. In recent months, a movie came out portraying Russians in the country as heroes — an echo of another Russian movie that came out last year in Libya, presenting two imprisoned Russians who worked for a company linked to Mr. Prigozhin in a favorable light.

The U.N. investigators had a different view. The Russians’ abuses in the Central African Republic have led to reprisals against other civilians, they said, “perpetuating the cycle of violence in the country.”",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/o9fp41/russian_mercenaries_are_driving_war_crimes_in/h3asmxy/,usmilitarythrowaway1,1624867418

3690,"You may have caught a time period where it wasn't mandatory because they waxed and waned about it a lot. I can assure you that they were mandatory for a significant amount of time, up until 2014-2015. So much so that when they became optional there was the issue of thousands of full time ""religion teachers""(ie. priests making an extra buck) drawing a full salary for 2h of work per week. 

When this happens to a subject (typically to less popular foreign languages) the school tries to merge students from different classes or even different years  to keep the teacher employed, or ends up dropping the teacher's position. But this last option wasn't available because, and this is the interesting bit, the Government had committed to making religion a core subject (you know, like Math) in the education law so it couldn't be dropped.

I don't mind new things being built, especially new affordable housing, which is very much needed in Copenhagen, but I still think that it can and should be done with some respect for the surrounding area.

 If they had built it in Ørestad on Amager or a bit farther out, it would have been a better fit. Both in terms of architecture and utility.

1. Single line graph with nicer description of EU population and then subdivision into men and women would be nicer. But for such simple information, this is servicable. They could just merge the information about 83.4 mil. EU pop and men and women into a single image.

2. Make figures represent milions. Make the division line bellow description so that it is easier to assign drug symbols to titles. Be consistent with figures for MDMA and amphetamines.

3. Kind of boring image that tries to throw at you various numbers without any particular connection. Maybe add a figure, where you divide drugs of interest into categories? Unify images of drugs.

4. What is crystal amphetamines? Why are they tracked separately? What is the distinction between powder and tablet ectasy? What is herbal and resin cannabis? Unify images of drugs. Notice that the extra whitespace between description and images make it easier to assign images to the correct titles.

5. Personally, bar graph is nicer. But this donut graph might be serviceable, if you sort the damn amounts. First cannabis, then cocaine, then heroin, then aphetamines and then MDMA. It would be also nice to put the retail value into connection with the number of druggies so we can compare the cheap and expensive substances.",Czech Republic / New Zealand,/r/europe/comments/o8tfew/the_eu_drug_market/h3aafgt/,Unicorn_Colombo,1624852743

3812,"I mean, you’re attributing things to the law that aren’t in it, and while the spirit of the law might be against how you interpret the articles of the EU, if the letter isn’t then Hungary can do what it likes. The law doesn’t and won’t prohibit works of fiction with gay characters in them. It prohibits showing them to minors. (Incidentally, good luck with that, gay characters are not always identified as such).

It seems daft to try and prohibit EU states from having the same freedoms that US states have. Indeed, the EU guarantees member states much more freedom. If Hungary decides to ban sex education altogether or raise the age of consent, or ban sexual content of all kinds to under 18s, that seems to me up to them, however daft or counterproductive I might see it.

It seems crazy to come down so hard on a country that still maintains far more gay rights than many core member states had at the moment Hungary joined. Again, I’d ask- were those countries in violation of these articles then? And if not, what has changed other than the norms of those core countries?

Core EU values are also compromise and a commitment to live and let live. When gay people start having to declare their sexuality or are systematically excluded from government jobs then might be the time to act, but this law isn’t that even if it might set up the mood music for it.

There are any number of reasons to be concerned about the trajectory Hungary and Poland are taking. But getting hysterical and waging a culture war on them seems to me to be utterly counterproductive and playing into the authoritarian’s arms. They have the same rights as any other EU state and it’s a really bad look having the West try and dictate to them, not to mention a bad idea when there isn’t really much they can legally do.

There is a clear gender difference among those with tertiary education: a larger share of women (46%) aged 25-34 had completed tertiary education than men (35%). While the share of men with tertiary education has been on the increase over the last ten years, the rate of growth has been slower than for women. As a result, the gender gap has increased to 10.8 percentage points (pp) from 9.4 pp in 2011.

3878,"Nuclear power is a great and very stable counterweight against fluctuations in the powergrid caused by the volatile nature of most renewables. When the wind blows, the snows melt in spring and the sun shine, we overproduce power and energy prices plummet. In some cases, companies and factories are even paid to consume power so the grid won't break of stress when supply suddenly drops due to no wind or sunshine.

In 2019 we had to run several very old, and extremely dirty powerplants with fossil-fuel to make up for dips in the grid, because we had closed down a reactor before getting any replacement for the power it provided. 

We do have a good amount of hydroelectric power from the many dams built on the great rivers up north, but we lack the infrastructure to reliably transfer it to the energy-hungry indistries in the southern part of the country. 

The solution from our politicians has been to import power from continental europes coal- gass- and oil fueled plants so they can be smug about that it is not ""us"" doing the burning of fossile fuels. Most swedish politicians are still stuck in the rigid idea that nuclear is automatically bad, and instead of researching ways to modernize it, make it safer and advance our knowledge of it, they do anything to close reactors down ahead of time and scare away investments in the area with threats of overnight making it illegal to earn money from nuclear power.

In the 80's there was a big poll/referendum about the future of nuclear power. The 3 options given were: 1) ""close all nuclear plants as fast as possible"" 2) ""build no new plants and gradually phase the current reactors out"" or 3) ""Stop all research/development about nuclear power, let the 6 already built and running reactors run for no more than 10 years, and forbid all uranium mining in the country.""

So, the ""choice"" given were ""Hell no!"", ""No!"" and ""Jesus-fucking-fuckety-fuck-no!""",,/r/europe/comments/o90d7s/strong_support_for_nuclear_power_in_sweden/h3aev3p/,Furiously_Average,1624855776

 [Soviet demands in late 1939](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_of_the_Winter_War#Soviet_demands_in_late_1939) 
 
 &gt;On 5 October, the Soviet Union invited Finland to negotiations in Moscow. The Finnish government did not hasten to comply, like the Estonian government had earlier. Unlike the Baltic countries, the Finns started a gradual mobilisation under the guise of ""additional refresher training"". The Finnish government sent its the foreign minister but its ambassador in Stockholm, Juho Kusti Paasikivi to limit his powers as a negotiator.
 
**[Shelling_of_Mainila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelling_of_Mainila)** 
 
 &gt;The Shelling of Mainila (Finnish: Mainilan laukaukset, Russian: Ма́йнильский инциде́нт, romanized: Máynil'skiy intsidént) was a military incident on 26 November 1939 in which the Soviet Union's Red Army shelled the Soviet village of Mainila (Russian: Ма́йнило, romanized: Máynilo) near Beloostrov. The Soviet Union declared that the fire originated from Finland across the nearby border and claimed to have had losses in personnel. Through that false flag operation, the Soviet Union gained a great propaganda boost and a casus belli for launching the Winter War four days later.
 
**[Soviet–Finnish_Non-Aggression_Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet–Finnish_Non-Aggression_Pact)** 
 
 &gt;The Soviet–Finnish Non-Aggression Pact  was a non-aggression treaty signed in 1932 by representatives of Finland and the Soviet Union. The pact was unilaterally renounced by the Soviet Union in 1939 after having committed a deception operation in Mainila in which it shelled its own village and blamed Finland. The Soviet Union had started negotiations for non-aggression pact negotiations with its neighbouring countries in Europe during the Japanese invasion of Manchuria to secure its own borders. Although Finland was the last to sign the pact, on 21 January 1932, after Estonia, Latvia and Poland, it was the first to ratify it in July 1932.

First of all the law doesn't kick accepted refugees out it only says they should stay outside of Denmark/EU until they have been accepted/denied refuge (for anyone confused). In theory this law leaves the amount of refugees accepted completely unchanged as they will be judged on the same metrics and in practice might increase the flow of refugees into Denmark in the long term by making application easier for people in Africa and the Middle East.

&amp;#x200B;

But more importantly the crime (including gun crime) in Sweden has nothing to do with people IN the asylum seeking process but rather with accepted refugees/migrants and their descendants being poorly integrated and arguably also a failure of the justice system of Sweden to properly prevent crime/gun crime like this.

That’s how culture in general works. It evolves. Some die out and are replaced by new stuff. Just how the various cultures we have nowadays have been born out of older ones that are now gone.  

It’s only relevant in the sense that we’re talking about a government oppressing a certain kind of people or keeping people from following and living out their culture. Like people think this “super state” will. It’s not relevant if we talk about culture in a sense of it being culture. Unless you mean to say that part of that countries culture is oppression. The EU doesn’t want to change their culture/their rituals. They just want to make it so that every citizen of that state can enjoy those rituals. As it stands the state is effectively keeping some of its citizens from practicing their own peoples’ rituals, and living out their culture. Sounds kinda oppressive to me.

No not out of spite. Personally I want it because I think  Europe is full of great countries and people. But I don’t see the point in separating us by borders and flags. We all have so much in common but also have all this stuff that makes us and our ways unique.

It can be quite a challenge, at the best of times, to return a gaze where each eye looked towards a slightly different part of you. That the eyes were fiercely individualistic, in terms of size, and colour, and even *focus*, made the experience like trying to arm-wrestle someone who had two right hands, each on a different-sized table, both of which were on wheels, as where the chairs you sat on.

Wow, how utterly disgusting. Try using that rhetoric for the Holocaust.

&gt;Greek were no angels to the Muslim population. Not in Anatolia, not in Cyprus.

There’s a massive difference. The Greeks were colonised and brutally subjugated by the Turks for centuries, and when Greeks attacked Turks it was like over the rest of the Balkans; never organised above communal levels, fairly impromptu acts of retaliation against their erstwhile brutal colonial overlords.

Whereas the Turkish state at the highest levels organised a number of unprovoked campaigns of genocide to displace, replace and subjugate its colonial subjects.

&gt;Either way the disaster (often dubbed earthquake) diplomacy is a good thing for both sides. It should be appreciated.

There was no “disaster” or “earthquake”. Those are acts of nature that cannot be influenced or prevented.

There were multiple genocides and campaigns of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the Turks. There’s nothing to be “appreciated” about that, you genocide apologist nitwit. It’s a policy Turkey has resorted to again and again even nowadays, in Cyprus and Northern Syria.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/o8tmvu/ss_kurtuluş_the_turkish_ship_that_carried_6735/h38vqwv/,NeverMindTheStiffCoc,1624824774

4293,"1- you are saying that a motive and a consequence are always linked. If someone was robbing your house and you punch them in the face the motive for the punch was the defense of yourself and your property, the fact it hurt them is just a consequence of your action. If you use your logic in this situation (let's say that the robber was black) i could accuse you of racism for punching a black robber in the face because you did it with the motive of hurting a black person.  


3-I think whataboutism is what you just did by saying ""russia did x but so did y"". i might be mistaken so i'm not gonna fight too hard here. My point is thatother countries doing bad stuff doesn't invalidate the fact that russia doing it is bad, it just means both are bad.  


4-The point of human rights and all that stuff is that you gotta have \*all\* of them. America, for example, has outlawed slavery, free speech to a larger than normal extent, freedom of religion, etc. but it still has bad stuff like systematic racism, a voting system that encourages only 2 parties being in power thus maintaining the status quo, imperialisn, an economic system that perpetuates class rigitiy (yeah i'm a socialist, feel free to ignore this part in particular, just wanted to point out stuff i disagree with in america),etc. Russia does give some right to it's people but there are areas where it's pretty lacking. There's the lack of media freedom, the fact putin has stayed in power for...21 years? which sounds very sketchy, etc.  


5-yeah, i agree with all of those criticisms. lemme go back a bit to explain how those became allies. When ww2 ended the 3 major powers were the US, the UK which was on their side mostly and then became kinda irrelevant with decolonization, the independence of india and all that and the USSR which was the enemy. everything the US did until the dissolution of the USSR was in an attempt to become more powerfull and prevent them from doing the same. There were countries which has authoritarian/fascist governments (mine included) who were brought into the US's SoI to consolidate power in that region (in europe because they could be usefull against the soviets and in the middle east because of oil), that's the case for turkey, saudi arabia and the former soviet satelites that broke free once the union collapsed. During that time the main issue was ""red bad"" which was driven by idiology and not racism. When the ussr collapsed from what i understand there was an economic collapse and then Putin came along and did his thing. From what i understand the difference here between Russia and the other authoritarian states is that there was already a lot of antagonism from the days of the cold war and Russia was too big and powerfull, even during a bad time economically to be controlled by the US. It wasn't just ""russians bad"".  


on the tl:dr- the whole ""it's ok when we do it but not when you do"" is just because it's their side. Every country does this. In that scenario you mentioned where the tables are turned Russia would be doing the same thing. It's not because they're russians/americans, it's because they are the rival country. It's true that rivalry leads to racism sometimes and racism also leads to rivalries but that doesn't mean where there's one there's the other.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/o87cd2/bild_kremlin_invested_almost_115_million_euros_to/h38vu0k/,diogocp27,1624824817

**In a nation wary of the growth of Islam, France’s military has embraced and integrated its Muslim soldiers by facilitating their religious practice.**

DEIR KIFA, Lebanon — Gathered in a small mosque on a French military base in southern Lebanon, six soldiers in uniform stood with their heads bowed as their imam led them in prayer next to a white wall with framed paintings of Quranic verses.

After praying together on a recent Friday, the French soldiers — five men and one woman — returned to their duties on the base, where they had recently celebrated Ramadan, sometimes breaking their fast with Christians. Back home in France, where Islam and its place in society form the fault lines of an increasingly fractured nation, practicing their religion was never this easy, they said.

“The tolerance that we find in the armed forces, we don’t find it outside,” said Second Master Anouar, 31, who enlisted 10 years ago and who, in keeping with French military rules, could be identified only by his first name.

For the past two decades, as France’s Muslim population has sought a greater role in the nation, officials have often tried to restrict Islam’s public presence under an increasingly strict interpretation of French secularism, known as laïcité.

A law aimed at the Muslim veil in 2004 banned the wearing of religious symbols in public schools, and prompted years of anguished debates over France’s treatment of its Muslim population, Europe’s largest. A new law against Islamism by President Emmanuel Macron is expected to strengthen government control over existing mosques and make it harder to build new ones.

But one major institution has gone in the opposite direction: the military.

The armed forces have carved out a place for Islam equal to France’s more established faiths — by hewing to a more liberal interpretation of laïcité. Imams became chaplains in 2005. Mosques have been built on bases in France and across the world, including in Deir Kifa, where some 700 French soldiers help a United Nations force keep peace in southern Lebanon. Halal rations are on offer. Muslim holidays are recognized. Work schedules are adjusted to allow Muslim soldiers to attend Friday Prayer.",,/r/europe/comments/o94odn/in_frances_military_muslims_find_a_tolerance_that/h38vyzo/,quixotic_cynic,1624824887

&gt;Now, however, there are complex questions to be asked by lawmakers and doctors about how we adapt to a changing understanding of identity, especially when these divisions were &gt;originally created to protect women , who are a protected class

&gt;These are complex questions and if a bad solution is found, people will suffer (as evidenced).

&gt;This has been my point all along. You are trying to bundle complex philosophical questions up with 'do you support two adults consensually dating' and then wondering why we are stuck &gt;where we are.

4386,"&gt; Wasn't there any sex ed at all in the Romanian school system before?

There used to be back in the '90s, introduced after the Revolution. Unfortunately the Church took objection to it and used its large influence to have it eliminated and instead pushed for mandatory religion classes, which are in effect to this day. 

Religion classes teach Orthodox Christianity and don't care about the culture of the students. They have only recently been made opt-in rather than opt-out but in practice there's no way for students to not attend because the class is shrewdly placed in the middle of the schedule and there's nowhere else for them to go in the meantime.

In theory Romania is a secular state but the Orthodox Church enjoyed a powerful popularity after the fall of the Communist regime and it has been using this influence to secure a special position in the state. They get a share of the national budget (thus being effectively supported by the taxpayer), they get to run companies tax-free and compete with regular companies, they extort additional funds by ""suggesting"" donations to mayorships and by selling religious services (burials, marriages, christianings etc.) at steep prices (it's not like there's any competition). They are deeply embedded into politics and under the Social Democratic (PSD) regime all administrative functions had to have the Church's agreement ie. you may have been elected but could not really hold public office in local administration if the local priest wasn't happy. Proper Middle Ages stuff.

As you may suspect the Church doesn't exactly have a progressive outlook on things. They promote homophobia, xenophobia, racism, ignorance and all those nice Medieval values.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/o8xlvf/pm_citu_sex_education_will_be_taught_in_schools/h38h4ux/,snuflswasmyslavename,1624817531

4398,"&gt; Did you missed the part in the article which mentioned that almost zero fact finding was done?

As they put it on wikipedia, claimed by whom? 

The article shows one side of the story - it's pretty much his defense spiel, outlined for a friendly journalist. 

Why are you struggling so much to understand this?

If you were going to believe people accused of human smuggling, they'd all be innocent.  I mean: ""Mohammad is one of several asylum-seekers in recent months to have received long prison terms for trafficking or facilitating illegal entry despite arguing that they were just seeking safety"" - it's hardly a unique defense strategy, is it?

The idea that Greek courts are somehow unjustly condemning is the type of thing only absolute simpletons believe. 

I mean:

&gt;Papapadoleon, however, acknowledged that migrants may sometimes agree to take the wheel in return for a small payment, or free passage

Rightttttttt. Who the fuck does even believe in this? I guess the same type of person who also believed OJ Simpson was innocent and was being framed by the racist police forces?

It's not so clear-cut. In Donbass and Crimea, Russia does support the separatists and in the latter case introduced the military. But there was a degree of consensus and support among the population in those regions. Donbass is indeed mostly pro-Russian, as is Crimea.

Additionally, the conquest and separatism took place during political collapse in Ukraine. Considering that separatism did not go any further west and there were no insurgency movements in Dnipro, Mikolaiv or Odessa regions etc., it doesn't appear there is a possibility to just go and conquer another part of Ukraine.

There need to be conditions for that, and some full-scale brute force invasion to take over other regions is quite unlikely. What gained Putin points in Russia is that Crimea was nearly bloodless, while Donbass is sold as ""people's uprising"".

Thats because of EU.   


There is lots of british people living in Denmark and been here for 5-6 generations, how could they? Apperentently they couldnt travel pre EU...   


When we vikings came to UK in 900... Oh nevermind never happened, the world couldnt travel before EU.    


How did the crusades travel down Europe? They couldnt because apperentently travel first happened in 92... And that was the first time some one traveled over a border to another country in Europe! #kukkuk  


&gt;o retire to the sun like hundreds of thousands did before? That's effectively over now, except for the exclusive rich Brexiters who told their idiot followers that they'd keep all their rights. The liars.

Again this is a lie, atm their live 5 million brits in Spain, the only thing they had to do was to go apply for TIE, takes 5 minuts and you are legal in Spain.   


Its not hard to go and make your TIE number. My best friend is british he works in UK and live here in Spain, he have no problems at all. Your scaremongering is so obv for us who actually live here! We know your lieing and saying fake shit.

And if you wanna go to spain to live their after brexit, you just need to go to the police station, and make your TIE number. the only thing that changed is that you get TIE number now instead of NIE number. #kukkuk But what do i also know about this...

 &gt;Pregnancy in art covers any artistic work that portrays pregnancy. In art as in life, it is often unclear whether an actual state of pregnancy is intended to be shown. A common visual indication is the gesture of the woman placing a protective open hand on her abdomen. Historically, married women were at some stage of pregnancy for much of their life until the menopause, but the depiction of this in art is relatively uncommon, and generally restricted to some specific contexts.

4548,"1- i'm not gonna die on that hill. I don't think what he said is similar to the example you gave just now because ""black people"" dont have a representative as clear as ""the black people givernment"" so by saying black people its clear you mean the race. Still, it's really hard to try to know if he's racist or not so i sugest we don't go that way too hard.

2-i never said the russians or the germans wouldnt/didnt suffer. I simlly said they wouldn't be genocided because the conflict came from their policies, not their race. Ofc both would/did suffer but it was mainly the fault of their government being expantionist.

And yeah, i agree that the german recovery is a consequence of geopolitics and not simple good will from lord and savior 'murica (/s) but thats ultimately what all of this comes down to: geopolitics. Wanting a powerfull country to be less powerfull isn't a matter of hating the people, its a matter of countries making sure they are more powerfull. It still sucks that it works this way but we can't atribute stuff to racism and xenophobia.

3-first of all, i'm glad we agree that everyone should be punished when they fuck up. I think this should apply to all countries, not just Russia (including my own, i fucking hate how the Romani people are treated here and think there should be someone protecting them) however whataboutism isn't a good justification for when one country does something bad. Yeah, everyone else has shitty policies about *something* but so does Russia and those policies should still be criticised and acted against.

On your last point: as i said earlier its a matter of geopolitics. People don't hate the russian people, they're just more willing to act against their political enemies than their political allies. (Im not exactly sure how many alliances russia has so feel free to take this as just a hypothetical) If an ally of russia messed up and an enemy of russia did the same of course russia would also be criticising their enemy.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/o87cd2/bild_kremlin_invested_almost_115_million_euros_to/h37nxnk/,diogocp27,1624802684

Other political tools are also used. Strongmen appeared to disrupt the protests, or ridiculed politicians of the opposition (e.g dressing as a clown and making fun of them).

The whole field of Political Theology is an endeavour to trace Western notions of the Political to its roots in Christianity and earlier still in Graeco-Roman religions. This is basically solved for modern academia, not a question of ""if"", but ""in what way"". Understanding this religious (ontological+ethical basically) foundation allows for thorough analysis, predictive power and grounds for dialogue, adjustment or assimilation when dealing for political entities of other bases (Orthodox, Muslim, Hindu etc.).

The West's supposed secularity is incoherent in itself, since it has a totally Christian foundation, with attempts to dispose of it leading to total collapse of any value systems, yet attempts to maintain ""secular"" character of Western societies produce its own idiosyncrasies. Communism can be neatly analyzed as a Gnostic heresy turning into a doomsday cult, complete with ""secular"" prophets, saints, holy wars, Historical Providence and the apocalyptic Catechon which solves all world problems forever (the World Revolution).

**The statement of Emanuelis Zingeris (Chairman of the International Commission for the Evaluation of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania,) Founder of Vilna Gaon Museum of Jewish History in Lithuania.**


On 29 June 2020, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) published tendentious information which, regrettably, violates the most elemental standards of unbiased journalism. This information has been widely cited by many international publications, including the Times of Israel and the Jerusalem Post. Russian official media has been especially keen to disseminate the attacks on Juozas Lukša-Daumantas as part of its recent disinformation campaign aimed at buttressing Moscow’s efforts to legitimize the Soviet occupation of the Baltic States and downplay Stalinist atrocities. An example is the article by Aleksei Ilyashevich, “Lithuania answers Putin’s article by making a hero of Hitler’s assistant,” which recycles the attacks on Juozas Lukša-Daumantas.

The JTA has published claims that “multiple witnesses” saw Lukša-Daumantas participating in the notorious murders of Jews at the Lietūkis garage in Kaunas on 27 June 1941. The JTA spent most of its reportage asserting that Lukša-Daumantas, one of the most notable Lithuanian fighters against the Soviet regime, was a murderer of Jews. The JTA allows only a small part of its report to reflect the opinions of those who oppose this man’s defamation. Since the attack on one of the most celebrated members of the postwar Lithuanian anti-Soviet resistance movement has been so widely disseminated, with much uninformed commentary about the postwar resistance movement in general, it is essential to explain this history.

It is a historic fact that during the German occupation Lithuania lost over 90 percent of its Jewish citizens who were murdered by the Nazis and their local collaborators. It is thus crucial to determine if Lukša-Daumantas participated in this unprecedented campaign of mass murder. Juozas Lukša-Daumantas was born in 1921. During the German occupation, people of his community risked their lives to shelter Vasilii, an escaped Soviet prisoner of war. There is no evidence that these people, including Lukša-Daumantas, participated in any war crimes. This is not only the opinion of the “advocates” of the Anti-Semitic Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF) cited in the JTA report, but that of most of the mainstream academic historians who have researched the period of Lithuania’s occupations by foreign powers, as well as that of the current leaders of the Lithuanian Jewish Community.

The International Commission for the Evaluation of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania has not uncovered any reliable evidence confirming the participation of Lukša-Daumantas in the massacre of Jews at the Lietūkis garage. Notwithstanding some sensational allegations by tendentious authors, neither professional historians nor any of the current leaders of the Lithuanian Jewish Community have been able to identify Lukša-Daumantas as a “leader of the LAF,” or as a participant in the aforementioned atrocity. During the spring of 1941, the nineteen-year old Lukša-Daumantas joined like-minded young people, many of whom were secondary school and university students, to resist the Soviet occupation and was imprisoned as a result. There were many secretive small groups whose main activity was the dissemination of anti-Soviet leaflets. Most of the groups were short-lived, some of which may have been affiliated with the LAF, but aside from some assertions that he was a “member”, we know little of his activities at the time. In his published memoir he makes no mention of the LAF. None of the pro-LAF researchers in Lithuania mention Lukša-Daumantas as an active member of the LAF or as an anti-Soviet insurgent during the outbreak of the war in June 1941. The ethnologist and history guide Chaim Bergman, who states that he spoke at length with Lukša-Daumantas’s brother Antanas, doubts any connection to the LAF: https://www.lzb.lt/en/2020/07/17/a-different-view-of-luksa-daumantas-an-interview-with-chaim-bargman/. Some authors assert the he engaged in anti-German activities before 1944.

In 1951 Lukša-Daumantas was killed in action while on a mission to Lithuania supported by U.S. Intelligence. Almost immediately, the Soviet regime began to spread disinformation with the goal of denigrating not only Lukša-Daumantas but the entire anti-Soviet resistance movement. Lithuanian historians who have researched the movement have indeed found that a certain number of Nazi collaborators and criminal elements found their way into the ranks of the anti-Soviet guerillas. Some had been members of the LAF which in 1941 had espoused anti-Semitism and egregious “Judeo-Bolshevik” tropes. Soviet authorities have, of course, exploited this fact to attack the reputation of all anti-Soviet resistance movements and, by implication, affirm the legitimacy of the postwar Soviet regimes in the Baltics as “anti-fascist” strongholds. On 16 February 1949 the Council of the Lithuanian Armed Freedom Movement declared that “persons who betrayed the Fatherland during the Bolshevik and German occupations by collaborating with the enemy, or had in their actions or by their influence harmed the struggle for national liberation, or bloodied their hands by their treason, [such people] should be held accountable in Lithuania’s courts.”

It is especially important not to fall into the trap of Russian official propaganda which has tried to obfuscate the history of the Kremlin’s violations of international law, particularly those which predated the Nazi invasion of the USSR after the Hitler-Stalin (or Molotov-Ribbentrop) Pact of 1939. The Soviet attack on Finland in 1939–1940, which resulted in the USSR’s expulsion from the League of Nations on 14 December 1939, is portrayed as a “defensive measure,” although at the time Stalin was a strategic, if temporary, partner of the Third Reich in its war against the West. The occupation of the Baltic States under the threat of force and as a result of a military incursion by a half-million Red Army troops is portrayed as a “voluntary accession” of these countries to the USSR. The recent amendment to the Russian Constitution which purports to defend “historical truth,” the efforts to explain away the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939 and its secret protocols, and the public statements of President Putin questioning the territorial integrity of the Baltic States, are all parts of this campaign of distortion. In essence all of this seeks to undermine the historic right of the Lithuanian people to resist foreign domination, by armed struggle, if necessary. The European Court of Human Rights reaffirmed this right in Strasbourg on 12 March 2019.

On 23 July of this year, the United States marked the 80th anniversary of the declaration on the non-recognition of the Soviet incorporation of the Baltic States. The spirit of this declaration inspired the national liberation movements and all people in the region which resisted Soviet occupation.

It is worth remembering that during the half-century of Soviet occupation, the Kremlin consistently denigrated the Lithuanian resistance movement, the Home Army’s campaign against the Nazis, and even the Zionist struggle to establish Israel (while also supporting the aggression of Arab countries against the Jewish state). It is no secret that there is currently a bitter social conflict on the commemoration of many historical personages, and on the question of whether to include them as positive figures in the national narrative. The struggle to determine which historical figures are examples for the younger generation is clearly one that has become global in recent months. Those who participated in the oppression of others, or passively conformed to the dictates of occupation regimes, should have no place in the gallery of heroes. Unfortunately, in Lithuania we have some monuments for Nazi criminals which are not State-sponsored and which are being vigorously debated. At the same time, disinformation and lies about those who gave their lives for freedom, fighting the monstrous communist occupational regime of Stalin, should have no place in our discourse. Lithuania had a right to resist.

Also I'm not denying this, as seen from a comment from this very same line of comments you are responding to; ""As of right now, we do have poor/bad neighbourhoods but no 'problem areas' whatsoever in the Netherlands. I have read some news about a risk of new problem areas developing though, and that new policy is being thought up to combat this. It's something that needs monitoring and every once in a while it comes to the point where new action is needed to prevent really bad problem areas from forming.""

I have shown proof of past policy involving demolishing and patching up problem neighbourhoods turning those neighbourhoods into decent ones without such issues, in the form of a study of TU Delft investigating the effects of that past policy. One of your own sources literally states that problem areas were gone, but are now returning, and two are calling for policy to prevent the old problem areas from reappearing. You are just confirming what I have said, not providing counterarguments. You seem to be filtering out all the bad news to use as arguments (problem areas are returning and new policy is needed to combat them again) while ignoring I'm talking about the *past* policy that is directly responsible for problem areas disappearing in the past to begin with and that your very sources are confirming this claim that they were/are in fact gone.

The majority of the Soviet bombings of June 1941 (they continued beyond just 25th) did not target the Northern Finland where the Germans were. Instead the majority of the attacks targeted the Southern part of Finland. When i referred to the Finnish airfields i meant the ones in the southern part of Finland (i.e. under Finnish control). However even the Germans in Northern Finland were prohibited from attacking from  the Finnish territory (or airfields).

Germans had the right to refuel in certain airfields and also to overfly. Which is what the bombers did on June 25th. As Finland had not allowed the attacks to be launched from Finland  the German bombers started from East Prussia, bombed Leningrad and its approaches (air-dropped mines), and then refueled at Malmi (IIRC) airfield before flying back to East Prussia.

4845,"The Republic of Cyprus was established in the territory of the island of Cyprus excluding these two regions.

Whether you like it or not that's what happened. The Treaty that Established the Republic ot Cyprus is clear on that. It's the Treaty of Establishment that created the Cypriot state, thr same treaty that exclude 3% of the territory and turned it to Soveriegn British Bases. 

So this isn't about the Treaty of Guarantee, it's about the Treaty of Establishment of the Republic of Cyprus. Is the Treaty that established Cyprus null and void?

The Treaty of Guarantee didn't create the British bases, it's a Treaty between four countries and one of its articles is that the Republic of Cyprus, the Hellenic Republic and the Republic of Turkey respect the soveriegnty of the British Bases.

Both of these Treaties have constitutional force.

&gt;Also my case still stands, Cyprus the island is 9251 square kilometers, same as RoC, so zero real sovereignty for UK. Basic mathematics.

Your point that google says so?

Many politicians stand against this, many supported to start a case against the UK like Mauritius did.

You can of course question that but to a big extent that is the truth.

And it turns out that poor people are more likely to commit crime (huge surprise! ;) )

So what is happening is that the state sees and issue with saying ""people of this background are criminals"" because surprisingly that does not improve the situation when landlords and employers start to avoid certain people because of skin colour or name due to those statistics.

On the other hand not publishing that while also not making any changes to integration policy makes it a lot harder to swallow for the public.

Because the populace is generally conservative - any change is a pain because it requires changing one's life patterns. Some are worth it, because their pros are greater than their cons, but they still require changing people's comfort zones. See Swiss referenda as evidence.

The inflation rate in Hungary between 2010 and today has been 31.22%, which translates into a total increase of Ft31.22. This means that 100 forints in 2010 are equivalent to 131.22 forints in 2021. In other words, the purchasing power of Ft100 in 2010 equals Ft131.22 today. The average annual inflation rate has been 2.29%.

The problem here is that while wages are rising, they are not rising this fast, and they are rising in specific sectors (IT, some blue collar work that requires expertise, like plumbing or house renovations, because most professional have left the country, so the demand is bigger than what the workers can handle).

But most teachers still make nearly the same wages that were abysmal in 2010 already. So do nurses, and so did doctors until 2020 (they had to sign a contract that declared that, while they get more money, they can be stationed anywhere in the country at the drop of the hat, like soldiers - those who didn't sign weren't allowed to practice anymore).

Fidesz' propaganda is heavily reliant on being against **Them** and their attacks on traditional European values; on Orban being the bulwark against foreign influence that would change Hungary into the corrupt, pedophile-infested hellholes that the Western countries are. Hungary is under attack, people, vote Fidesz to save us from Soros and his homolobby!

Now imagine that this Hero of the People is actually killed - what do you think the reaction would be? Lech Kaczyński's accidental passing was used as a rallying cry for PiS for years, think how much worse it would be if someone actually stabbed Orban on vision, with a political cry against him.

Gangs lose a bunch of influence this way and a bunch of recruting potential. They might be forced to move as well or to fragment. 

If you want to take it far enough, the government could choose to rebuild almost the entire neighbourhood to scatter pretty much all of those that live there across the country. No way a gang survives that. Does this cost money? Yes, it's a major project. But a government should be willing to spend a lot of money to stop really bad problem areas from existing. It's not an acceptable thing that there are areas in Sweden where the police low key don't want to go anymore because organised crime is so extreme.

Its the biggest, multiday music festival of europe. Over a thousand concerts/party are giving in a week with most of them having no entrance fee.

5221,"&gt;No, i think they put them on trailers and deliver them with a truck, but i might be wrong.

You're not, but that's the last 100 km and maybe the first as well if the infrastructure isn't there, since doing that for the whole trip would essentially be km-after-km of truck convoys. 

The Dacia Pitesti factory produces about 1.400 cars per day. A truck would hold about 10 cars, meaning 140 trucks of cars per day in total. That's one truck every 10 minutes for just one factory hitting the road. In Australia, where they do use roads for everything, they have literal massive road trains to handle that sort of output.  


&gt;As for the boats, i think the primary target of german automakers is western europe, not russia or turkey. Trains i know squat about, but that could be a viable solution i guess

Why would you think that? German brands are ""prestige brands"" internationally, while also competing in Europea against some fairly established domestic brands.

The target for German automakers are Chinese, Americans and other ""new middle class"" in other countries:

5222,"&gt;the price Germany gave

You mean what was imposed on Germany? Germany gave WW2. That's what it took for the rest of the world to do something. You were not willing to do anything. You had to be beaten in a world war. Don't speak like it was the Germans who overthrew Hitler. Don't speak like Hitler didn't have a majority. You were favouring a dictator as well and it took a world war and 40 years of foreign occupation to undo that. You got a lot of financial support from the West, which allowed you to rebuild and prosper. Central and Eastern Europe didn't have that privilege. We were sold to Stalin so the rest of the world could stop the fight. We lost 40 years of progress and it shows, with many Central and Eastern European countries suffering from corruption, nepotism, lack of education (because communists didn't like the intelligent elites and murdered, discriminated or otherwise attacked them many times, so a lot of them emmigrated), hostility towards successful people (because ""they surely stole that or paid someone for that position""), conservatism and many other things. That's why opposition has difficulty. Because ""they are the same as the ruling party"", ""they are stealing too"", they are weak, they can't unite etc.

But of course, it's the people's fault. How dare they not be as educated and smart as we, Holy Western Europeans who do no wrong and are always progressive and ready for change, are. Oh we are just so perfect. Why do we bother with those Eastern peasants! The EU should only be for Western Europeans! Eastern Europe doesn't deserve it!

But: I strongly dislike the implication that the Hungarian Populus is to blame. Democracy assumes fully educated voters and I would love to hear from a single European country where you can honestly say most voters have read the party-program of the parties they voted for.

https://youtu.be/6QALFRgcni0

Song is Olovni Vojnici (tin soldiers) and English translation:

The tin soldiers

Speech of Major Dragutin Gavrilović to the defenders of Belgrade during WWI:
""Soldiers, exactly at three o'clock, the enemy is to be crushed by your fierce charge, destroyed by your grenades and bayonets. The honor of Belgrade, our capital, must not be stained. Soldiers! Heroes! The supreme command has erased our regiment from its records. Our regiment has been sacrificed for the honor of Belgrade and the Fatherland. Therefore, you no longer need to worry about your lives: they no longer exist. So, forward to glory! For the King and the Fatherland! Long live the King, Long live Belgrade!""
 
Don't know where I am, I lay in dark deaf room
But I know that I'm not dead, because pain is great
Like mole in the hole I use smell and touch
Cold bars of bed, terry smells like disease
The tube from the arm ends in a bottle
As panicked I find out that bandage covers my eyes
Stoned blood under the gauze is unbearably itching
I guess I'm in hospital, I suspect the worst
I cry for help and hope that I'll be heard
Air leaves my chest, but sound is absent
In vain I'm trying to figure out what's happening
In memory I search key piece of puzzle
 
Ref:
Our number is drawn,we aren't relevant anymore
We charge into the battle, just that the people survive
We harmonized our steps and focused our mind
Every fighter is needed to be like walls to the offensive.
 
Respite from the blood, the grave silence
Across the horizon heavy cloud of powder
And kilometers of wire, clock says it's dawn
Life goes on somewhere, I lost my step
It rained for a long time, chill in the bones
Muddy water washes the walls of the trench
New entry in diary and it bothers me again
Are those maybe my last words
Story of a platoon, all kind of people
The battle dressed them up in the same uniforms
Trough madness of front, loyal to each other
Indecision of one could be the death of all
Each morning the same order is waiting
We liberate the places of which names I can't remember
After the perilous assault 'till the last bullet
Fate is bloody on the top of the bayonet
I waken myself, immediate movement
I watch faces around me, a well-known grimace
Weapons at the ready, I put away my diary
Artillery fire escorts our charge
 
First step trough the mud, under cross fire
Heavily breathing under the gas mask
Capturing no man's land, meter by meter
Smell of powder and blood that carries the wind
Corpses and the wounded, screams aren't heard
Like scarecrows masked, they are twisted on the wire
Cannon meat, the tin soldiers
This field is the board - we are figures in the game
I don't have time to think, shots fly by
Positions that we need to reach we can't see
'till there is life left in me I won't give up
For greater goal - we aren't important.
 
We pay freedom with the blood...Forgive us Lord...
 
Chill goes through my spine out of fear
I take of the mask, and I manage to catch my breath
My eyes are stinging from the blood that is pouring
Everybody still charges - offensive hasn't stopped
I get up slowly, my leg is twitching
The feeling comes back and I start to run
There are buzz in my ears, but [I] can't see what's happening
I start to shoot - don't know if I'm hitting
We breached the line - the enemy is falling back
Rushed into the trench determined more then ever
To go the end, we waited long for the offset
Eyes to eyes - bayonet in stomach

Where I'm trying to go with this is that nothing, not our history, and arguably neither our culture, makes it ""important"" for us to live in democracy.

He tweeted (translation):

&gt;Police will prepare a report on action against yellow vests. However, in my opinion, only they came to Prešeren Square unnecessarily, as they could celebrate culturally on the Republic Square. Don’t throw pearls among pigs, the Bible says, and you could follow that wisdom.

  
Context: The Slovenian authoritan far-right prime minister Janez Janša is a mini Trump / Orban wannabe and his government is very unpopular but keeps doing everything to gain absolute control of the media, police, etc.  
  
Yesterday was 30 years of Slovenian independance with an official celebration on Republic Square (even Orban was there) but a lot of opposition polititians boycotted it due to the actions of the government. At the same time where was also an ""alternative celebration"" of protesters on Prešeren Square. The ""Yellow vests"" are not like those in France but are a group closely related to some known neo-nazis (complete with nazi tatoos &amp; nazi salutes). Those came to Prešeren Square to cause trouble but the police removed them.  
  
That really upset the interior minister Aleš Hojs and the general director of the police Anton Olaj. Because apparently it's fine when the police stops and fines anti-government protesters but not when they do that to nazis. Now they want an investigation and ""measures"" against the police officers responsible for that.

5556,"I'm neither right or left leaning in terms of policy. I think both sides get it awfully wrong. In my opinion modern politics puts too much emphasis on issues that matter on a personal level but are irrelevant to us as a society or species.

Neither sides correctly approach the following global issues: overpopulation, societal aging, climate change, air pollution, water pollution, soil pollution, drug resistant superbugs in agriculture, drug resistant infections in humans and animals, the existence of wars in the 21st century is just baffling to me, when we literally have the tools to properly communicate with every single human being on the planet.

I also have the following opinions that are very unpopular with the right: I think people should get to decide whether they like any form of sexuality other than their own, it shouldn't be shoved down their throats and if they oppose, it's labeled as bigotry. I also think that people who are unable to contribute to society shouldn't be benefiting from society. I think if a person commits a serious crime, they should lose their human rights, and should no longer be protected by the law, e.g.: if a person breaks into my home they have the intent to harm me and cause me financial loss, so I should be at liberty to protect myself against them by whatever means I see necessary.

As for the propaganda factories in countries like Hungary: if you've consumed anything the government controlled media produces and have an IQ of over 80 or just primary School level understanding of the world, you should be able to discern that it's mostly bullshit. Most of it is either made up completely or some bent version of reality tailored to incite rage and uneasiness towards people with opposing views, which is what propaganda is.

\#2 Iconize, an italian influencer with 600k followers claiming he was randomly beaten by some homophobic dudes while walking his dog just because he was gay; conveniently, the aggression took place right before he turned up as a guest on national television to talk about LGBT rights and promote his persona. (spoiler: he came out clean a couple of days later apologizing in a video for making up the entire thing, black eye included)

am I the only one noticing a trend?

...and these are just 2 random occurrences I picked off of Saviano (note for foreigners: an outspoken, ultra-liberal journalist with a cult following in Italy) bringing them up as proof of LGBT people being oppressed and a crisis taking place (these are just 2 cases out of the 8 he highlighted, took me 5 minutes on Google to debunk them).

Far from it.

The ArciGay claims there were 138 ""hate"" crimes against LGBT people in Italy last year (reported cases, not confirmed ones).

The LGBT population in Italy is around 5-7%.

The country as a whole has seen 30000 cases of aggression for whatever reason over the same span of time.

Assuming equal distribution and according to math, we should've seen up to 1500 ""hate"" crimes against LGBT people over the course of the past 12 months.

5926,"&gt;Bavaria's Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) HAS described the deadly knife attack in Würzburg city centre as a rampage. All of Bavaria was horrified by what had happened in Würzburg, Söder said at the beginning of a state delegates' meeting of the CSU. Earlier, Söder had already ordered flags of mourning for the Free State. It was a ""difficult day for Bavaria"", Söder said.
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier also expressed his dismay at the attack. ""We are shocked by the horrific act of violence that has claimed the lives of three people and injured many others in Würzburg,"" he said. The perpetrator had acted ""with extreme brutality"". He would be held accountable for this inhuman act by the rule of law. ""Today, all over Germany, we mourn with the relatives of the victims,"" the Federal President added. ""My thoughts are with those who have lost their loved ones. To those injured, I wish a speedy recovery."" He added that his thanks go to the police forces ""who overpowered the perpetrator with decisive action, and to the rescue workers who cared for the injured"".
Meanwhile, police have launched extensive investigations. The motive of the alleged perpetrator, who apparently attacked people with a knife without any warning late on Friday afternoon, remains unclear. Three people were killed and at least five others injured, two of whom, according to a police spokeswoman, are in danger of dying. She did not say how many others were injured. ""Investigations are continuing."" She announced a press conference for Saturday afternoon.
Suspected perpetrator lived in a homeless shelter
Little is known about the alleged perpetrator so far. After his attack, the 24-year-old had been held at bay by passers-by in the city centre until police were able to arrest him after a well-aimed leg shot. He is currently in a hospital in the city.According to initial information, he has been living in Germany since 2015 - most recently in a homeless shelter. According to the mayor of Würzburg, Christian Schuchardt (CDU), he had been known to the police and was undergoing psychiatric treatment. Only a few days ago, he was forcibly admitted to a psychiatric institution, said Bavaria's Minister of the Interior Joachim Herrmann (CSU). In addition, an Islamist motive of the attacker is being investigated, because according to witnesses, he shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (English: God is great) during the attack.

5975,"I'm sorry but that's not true. Morocco has maintained much of its Islamic art. I would say better than Spain in some aspects. For example the palm groves in the dra valley have nothing to Envy from this one and the famous Giralda in Seville is almost an exact copy of the koutoubia in Marrakech.
   
Morocco is a fascinating country with a lot of heritage and I don't like to see them frowned upon. In Spain much of the Arab heritage was *frowned upon* and many times the only reason we have it is because someone decided to protect it against the norm. In fact this very site may very well not exist if it wasn't because the Christian conquerors decided to maintain it. The same can be said for the Cordoba mosque.
   
One thing that I'd like to clear up with this series is that the Arabic heritage in Spain is greatly overrepresented.  we don't actually have many truly significant sites from that period (or at least not as many as we should) that's why the ones we have left are so important.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/o86m9f/week_5_palmeral_of_elche/h33d09a/,alikander99,1624702449

5988,"Have a look at current surveys like this one: https://www.bundestagswahl-2021.de/umfragen/

To form a government, a coalition needs 50% + 1 seat.

As the CDU has had the highest values for months now, they're most likely in the government (probably making Armin Laschet Federal Chancellor). The Greens have massively improved and are now the second strongest force in the surveys. Together, CDU and the Greens could potentially reach the 50% + 1 so a black-green government is likely.

If they don't reach the 50% + 1, they need a coalition partner. All of the parties say they wouldn't form a coalition with the (right-wing radical) AfD so they drop out. The CDU would never coalesce with the (socialist) Linke so they're also no option. 

SPD as a third coalition partner would be a totally possible option because CDU and SPD have been for a period of 16 years in the GroKo (Big Coalition) together.

I don't think CDU and the Greens would coalesce with the FDP because there has never been a coalition like this and such a huge change is quite radical for German politics. Also, the FDP has refused such a coalition in 2017 so I don't think that CDU and the Greens would risk that again.

Judging by the figures, other coalitions without the CDU could be possible but are not much likely when it comes to policies. For example, in 2017 there had been discussions about other coalitions but nothing worked out so I don't think the parties would risk a scenario like in 2017 again.

Another option would be Greens + SPD + Linke aka Red-Red-Green or Green-Red-Red. That's a very common and quite successful constellation for regional and state politics but I don't know whether they could reach the 50% + 1 on federal level.",,/r/europe/comments/o7v5sq/german_election_programs_on_china/h33d57m/,G13XY,1624702581
