History sources are not treated like holy word. People want to make their patrons look good, legal documents can be fake or with misleading information. 

What we know is that Koktritz charged at Jagiełło, Jagiełło lance broke, and Oleśnicki ended up killing Koktritz for which he was branded as murderer, and had to plead with pope himself before getting dispensis 13 years later  from pope Martin V.   
Non crimes generally don't involve heads of state and don't result in pope issuing documents that something did not happen.

What historians and documents mention unreliably is that Zbigniew used Jagiełło broken lance and struck Koktritz. Nadolski claimed he did it from side or back, but to me it always seemed like a way for him to explain this question that naturally confuses you and everyine who read about it and doesn't accept openly biased sources at face value. 

Another poster accepts without critique the text of said dispensis, which claimed Zbigniew didn't shed blood and other knights struck killing blow. So why none of them were named or even mentioned in multitude of texts mentioning this event? Priests often rode to battle, and sometimes wielded blunt weaponry to get around the ""shed blood"" thing which is absurd if you ever saw injury from being hit with a mace. Or been in a fight other than with pillows. It's hard to beat someone up with your fists without shedding blood, much less kill a fucking knight, come on.

ALL of the corrupt parties we are protesting against here are members of ALDE (or PASD in the case of BSP) and yet none of these European groups have spoken out agains the rampant corruption by their members, they even support them AGAINST the protesters.

For example, ALDE president Van Baalen called the protesters ""extremists"" and called Ahmed Dogan (who is literally a mafia boss, he doesn't have any official political or administrative position, yet is guarded by our National Security for some reason) to stand up to them and commended him as ""very brave"".
As a reminder, the protesters were not trying to get into private property or attack him, they were simply trying to get to a PUBLIC beach on a PUBLIC road, which Dogan has illegally seized as his own, built his own illegal palace on and blocks entry to anyone else nearby.

Oh, and as for his role as ""keeper of peace between ethnicities"", he is literally a former State Security agent (Bulgarian KGB) who committed some of the most heinous crimes against Muslim and Turkish citizens in the 80s. He doesn't care about Muslims one bit, he is just using them as a shield.

354,"When he was younger, said Peter Schild, a 25-year-old university student here, he and his friends would often buy things just because they were American, from athletic shoes and music cassettes to movie tickets and blue jeans. As far as he was concerned, America's icons and heroes were Europe's too, part of a common cultural matrix reinforced by imports of American television shows and the latest Hollywood movies.

Now, like many his age, Mr. Schild says he is looking increasingly to the countries around him, rather than to the United States, for his cultural signals. ""I like America still, but now I want to know I am more interested in Europe, including European music and films,"" Mr. Schild said. ""Perhaps I've just seen too much of American culture that I take it for granted, but it's Europe that seems new and exciting to me now.""

All across Western Europe, in interviews with young people and discussions with advertisers, broadcasters and sociologists, there is a growing sense that American's hegemony over pop culture is being challenged, for the first time in decades, by the emergence of a rival European consciousness among young people, reflected in a very separate sense of music and fashion and even style. Beyond Rock

Beyond rock, there is rave and now techno, dance music with a kind of electronic beat that is hot across the Continent but virtually unknown in America. The subversive energy of urban American rap has been absorbed by Europe but wholly reconstructed by local artists, including immigrant communities like the Senegalese in France, whose lyrics and rhythms reflect their own lives and concerns.
And while teen-agers across the Continent were familiar with R.E.M., the American band, the music that most young Europeans talk about -- depending on where they live -- more often involves groups like Germany's Fantastischen Vier, or Austria's Falco, or Britain's Right Said Fred.

EuroDisney is disparaged as an unwelcome foreign intrusion, and MTV Europe, the European version of the American music channel, broadcasts a continuous diet of fashion, music and news that few American teen-agers would recognize.",,/r/europe/comments/hs238l/in_europe_americas_grip_on_pop_culture_is_fading/fy84fii/,Huufrt,1594877306

357,"Youthful European labels like Pepe, a brand of jeans, are sought out as eagerly as Levis once were, as are European fashions by Kookai and Chipie. As a destination for the hip and fashionable, the United States seems to have lost some allure. According to one marketing survey, when young people were asked to name the place they would most like to visit someday, they were likely to say Barcelona or Berlin before New York or Los Angeles.

""I want to go to Venice and Rome and Florence, not L.A.,"" said Benedicte Peu du Vallon, a 16-year-old from Paris. ""My parents loved America, and like a lot of American music, but my friends and I talk about Europe."" Parallels Political Trends

The notion of a growing and vital pan-European identity among the young parallels broad political trends on the Continent. This year the 12 member nations of the European Community joined to create a single European market, dropping many barriers to the movement of goods, people and money within the Community.
Still, the effluvia of mainstream American popular culture -- from the baseball caps worn by French and British teen-agers to the popularity of broadcasts of everything from World Wrestling Federation matches to the television serial ""Beverly Hills 90210"" -- continue to have a powerful resonance in Europe.

In Paris, Sergio da Silva, the 25-year-old manager of Chevignon, a store that sells American-style clothing, argues that America's influence over popular culture on the Continent remains undiminished. ""There is no European identity,"" Mr. da Silva said.

But among others, there is a sense that the strong American influence in clothing, music and fashion trends is waning, diluted by what Philippe Pauchard, a 23-year-old business student in France, described as ""a desire to be European, even if it is only a desire.""

The end of the cold war and the sometimes uncertain drift toward a continent in which there are no borders have loosed powerful currents of change across Europe, unsettling long-held political and cultural complacencies. For some young people this uncertainty has fueled rage directed at refugees and immigrants, whom they see as competitors for their own future.

In Germany this hatred has found a powerful voice in a kind of brutal hybrid of punk and heavy metal music that critics say aims to foment racial violence. Last month the police seized about 30,000 records, cassette tapes and compact disks on the grounds that they represented a danger to public safety.

But for many others, like Mr. Schild and his friends -- more educated and financially secure, perhaps -- it has also given shape to a different sense of the possibilities. Young, European and Proud

""It may be partly a class thing,"" said Pia Schlechtriemen, a 25-year-old friend. ""The people who are the most open are the ones with money, the ones who travel."" Last year, for example, more than 300,000 young Europeans wandered the Continent using Inter-Rail passes, which for the equivalent of about $370 allow a month's unlimited travel on European rail systems covering 26 countries.
Focus, a German news magazine, recently referred to what it called the emergence of the ""Yeppy,"" which it translated as ""young, European and proud of it."" At the same time, a pan-European advertising agency called Alto last fall published a slick 24-page brochure, describing in sharp statistical profile what it called the ""Eurokids"" and urging business and advertisers to look on under-30's across the continent as a kind of single market, unified more by age and cultural disposition than national origin.",,/r/europe/comments/hs238l/in_europe_americas_grip_on_pop_culture_is_fading/fy84h68/,Huufrt,1594877343

361,"Unlike older generations, younger Europeans are more likely than their parents to travel, postpone marriage and drink alcohol at a younger age, Alto said.

More important, they also share a common language in English. Research done by Reader's Digest in the 12 European Community countries indicates that nearly 70 percent of young people ages 18 to 24 speak English, compared with just 40 percent of those 25 and older.

No other language comes even close; only about 40 percent of the community youth surveyed claimed a knowledge of French, which took second place.

Simon Silvester, the writer of the report, recalled that for 20 years, the standard method for advertisers trying to reach the European youth market was ""to link the product to America."" 'A Powerful Image'

""Whilst America remains a powerful image for Europeans,"" he said, ""the indications from qualitative research are that America is no longer enough, and advertising imagery borrowed heavily from the American dream is now seen as a stereotype.""

It is the penetration of global communication networks, however, that has had one of the strongest influences. ""A few years ago, the only common culture we shared was American culture,"" said Michael Collin, the editor of i-D, a British magazine that charts youth fads and fashions. ""We all watched the same television program the night before, and we all talked about it the next day.
""Now, we have satellite television and cable stations and video rentals that allow us to see more things, from many different places. The result is a kind of fragmentation, with the proliferation of styles and music and fashion that are completely different from what you would see in America.""

Mr. Collin said that young people continue to pick up music and fashion signals from the United States, but that they are only one part of what he described as an increasingly diverse European youth culture.

When MTV began broadcasting on cable and satellite in Europe in 1987, it moved quickly to revamp its content. Its managers said they soon realized that recycled American and British pop stars were not going to be enough to win viewers.

""Despite their national and geographical differences, a young person in Finland has more in common with other young people in Greece than he does with his own parents,"" said William H. Roedy, chief executive officer and managing director of MTV Europe.

After five and a half years, MTV says that its cable and satellite broadcasts now reach 120 million viewers in 31 countries, including Russia. It uses European presenters who speak carefully constructed beginners' English, and most of the music segments they introduce are by European, not American, performers.

For example, one of the most popular segments features dance music known broadly as rave or techno, a kind of fast-paced, repetitive music that relies heavily on a strong electronic beat. Not well-known in the United States, where it is sometimes disparagingly labeled video game music, it is the anchor of a entire subculture, which revolves around dance clubs in cities from London to Rome.

The Europeanization of MTV underscores what some analysts regard as a kind of new cultural fusion, in which pop cultural trends imported from America are increasingly reworked and recast and then replayed, with a distinctive European spin.

Frank Brown, the head of advertising sales at MTV Europe, said it is wrong to argue that a European consciousness among the young is supplanting a consciousness about America. ""America still provides aspirational models,"" Mr. Brown said. ""But it is increasingly a two-way flow, and the result is a kind of fusion that in Europe has resulted in a much more diverse, and much more varied, youth culture.""",,/r/europe/comments/hs238l/in_europe_americas_grip_on_pop_culture_is_fading/fy84jtw/,Huufrt,1594877403

I have a hard time considering it as a problem. This actually prevents corrupted governments from using media for their advandage and spreading misinformation/propaganda. At least it makes it harder.

This is a good thing ( regardless if it is used aggainst liberal, conservative or nationalistic government) - it forces every government to face real problems.

Right now in Poland PiS has a TVP as their tube and internet bypasses it.

Before 2015 liberals in Poland had almost all media on their side and still thanks to internet they were removed from power (real problems were brought to light).

So weakening traditional media is good for democracy - it weakens governments ability to hide problems (once they have media on their side).",,/r/europe/comments/hrtwmf/why_populism_can_survive_the_pandemic/fy85cp4/,TyrantfromPoland,1594878097

It is selfish of people to expect protests worldwide to halt, just because there’s a virus lurking around. 

Violence doesn’t wait, oppression doesn’t wait, corruption doesn’t wait.

509,"&gt;which implies expanding global trade with the Commonwealth. They has it already...


No, we don't. When we joined the EEC we turned our backs on the Commonwealth and left behind free trade agreements with Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, India, Canada, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Burma, South Africa, Botswana, Nigeria, the list goes on and on and on. 


The EU is supposed to improve collective bargaining, but instead the UK has no trade deals with any of its strategic Anglo and Commonwealth allies, except for literally just Canada and Singapore. That's it. Those two. That's all. Trade liberalisation with SA didn't enter into force until 2012. CETA? Until 2017.


The UK's most important allies (America, Australia, NZ, Japan, Singapore, CPTPP, hopefully soon Canada) have been totally backburnered, and now we're negotiating with them. Simple.

It was a good idea to focus on the EU back then, but the Commonwealth is home to so much more economic growth at this point, and it's time we ditched Europe for greener pastures. /r/CANZUK.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/hrpdlt/brexit_was_meant_to_make_britain_global_it_has/fy7f356/,greenscout33,1594861253

552,"How is Ireland a parasite in context? The EU is treaty based, community law is put together by EU members collectively. The EU is whatever it's members collectively want it to be, it isn't imposed on those members. Ireland appears to have been acting within the rules it agreed to, and the other member states also agreed those rules. 

If you want to change them because you feel that Ireland is gaining an advantage then the only approach is to legislate in those areas where the EU has competencies (if that helps..) or change the treaties to give the EU more of a say in relation to tax. 

However if there is treaty change you'd obviously also expect the likes of Ireland to seek to balance the costs of any changes with benefits. Germany apparently currently sees the largest benefit ([see here](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-single-market-study/germany-wealthy-regions-are-biggest-winners-of-eu-single-market-report-idUKKCN1SE086)), will Germany look to spread those benefits? Would France look to give up some of the support it gets in agriculture to provide more support to Irish producers and so provide a benefit? Could there be a tightening and better enforcement of things like the rules around current account account surpluses? 

Any future integration or fiscal union will, as you point out, depend on popular support, but that support has to be present in each EU country or it will fail.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/hrkc1b/apple_and_ireland_win_13bn_tax_appeal/fy7h16c/,-ah,1594862370

572,"&gt;not the UK that acted the most selfishly for most of its time inside the EC, then EU.

That's a bit of a bizarre take. The UK did act in self-interest (as all EU members do..) but it navigated that extremely well much of the time. The opt outs the UK had are a major sign of that, rather than blocking EU moves toward integration in areas it didn't like and couldn't support, it stepped aside allowing those EU members who wanted to, to move forward while remaining outside of it. 

It would also be fair to say that the UK shielded other member states with similar views, even where that view was a minority position across the wider EU. It's going to be much harder for some EU member states to defend their interests absent the UK. That said, the Dutch are likely to step into the breach in the areas where they have an interest and we've already seen the V4 look for options to expand their ability to act.

That said, the parents view isn't particularly accurate in terms of how the EU will act, it can't compel members outside of the areas it has competencies, at best a majority can pressure members that fall out of line. That won't help however if the the perception is of Franco-German leadership to the detriment of other members.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/hrls0i/the_big_engine_that_might_how_france_and_germany/fy7hzng/,-ah,1594862926

655,"I think you are jumping to conclusions because a smaller population leads to problems independent of capitalism. The two main points are infrastructure and retirement. 

(1) Infrastructure: Many aspects of our infrastructure are set up for a larger population and do not work that easily with smaller populations. 

(a) One example out of many examples are fresh water and waste water pipelines, which need a minimum throughput to function. In some areas of Germany depopulation has required water providers to add loads of fresh water to wastewater pipelines to make them function properly. Of course, this is not a solution in the long run, i.e. new, smaller pipelines will have to be built. And this is independent of the economic system.

(b) Another example regarding infrastructure: how to make sure all kids will have access to schools and kindergardens when the population density is is much lower. In a country like Germany, will it still be possible for people with kids to choose feely where to live, or do we need restrictions according to where schools and kindergardens are located (because there will be whole areas where we cannot provide schools anymore)?

(c) A third example is public transport: Due to climate change, we will increasingly need public transport instead of individual traffic. But with a low population density it will be a waste of resources to offer public transport in areas where only few people actually use it. So entire areas will have to be decoupled from the transportation network and in some areas where we would need new transportation networks now, it does not make sense to build up the infrastructure because they will not be in use for long.

There are many more examples of this type: hospitals, power lines, hydrogen networks, internet connections, etc., etc. All these problems are practical problems that are independent of the economic system.

(2) The second big problem is retirement. Again, independent of the economic system, people get older and will reach a point of time where they can't work anymore and the younger generation will have to take care of them. When population decreases, this implies that fewer younger people will have to care for more older people, no matter what system they live in, and this, of course, will be an additional burden on the young generation.

***********************************************************************************

Finally, independent of the problems of population decline: capitalism does not require cheap labour. This assumption of yours is wrong, too. If there is not any cheap labour, things will just be more expensive and people will earn more. Both effects sort of even each other out. The price of labour just shifts the place where the market sits, similar to introducing minimum wages.

770,"&gt; On 16/26 October William boarded his ship, the Den Briel (Brill in English). His standard was hoisted, displaying the arms of Nassau quartered with those of England. The words Pro Religione et Libertate (""For Liberty and [the Protestant] Religion""), the slogan of William's ancestor William the Silent while leading the Dutch Revolt against Catholic Spain, were shown next to the House of Orange's motto, Je maintiendrai (""I will maintain"").[103] William's fleet, which with about 40,000 men aboard was roughly twice the size of the Spanish Armada – and assembled in a tenth of the time – consisted of 463 ships.[101] Among these were 49 warships of more than twenty cannon (eight could count as third rates of 60–68 cannon, nine were frigates), 28 galliots, nine fireships, 76 fluyts to carry the soldiers, 120 small transports to carry five thousand horses, about seventy supply vessels and sixty fishing vessels serving as landing craft.[104][105] Most of the warships had been provided by the Admiralty of Amsterdam. On 19/29 October William's fleet departed from Hellevoetsluis. 

&gt; [...]

&gt; Taking advantage of a wind again turned to the east, resupplied and re-equipped with new horses, the invasion fleet departed again on 1/11 November and sailed north in the direction of Harwich where Bentinck had a landing site prepared. The fleet changed course to the south however when the wind turned more to the north; it has been suggested that the initial move to the north was a feint and indeed James diverted some of his forces in that direction.[108] Thus they passed twice in sight of the English fleet, which was unable to intercept because of the adverse wind and an unfavourable tide.[70] On 3/13 November the invasion fleet entered the English Channel through the Strait of Dover in an enormous square formation, 25 ships deep, the right and left of the fleet saluting Dover and Calais simultaneously, to show off its size. The troops were lined up on deck, firing musket volleys, with full colours flying and the military bands playing. Rapin de Thoyras, who was on board one of the ships, described it as the most magnificent and affecting spectacle that was ever seen by human eyes. 

---------

&gt; William brought over 11,212 horse and foot. William's cavalry and dragoons amounted to 3,660.[112] His artillery train contained 21 24-pounder cannon. Including the supply train, his force consisted of about 15,000 men,[113] compared to James's total forces of about 30,000.[114][115] He also brought 20,000 stand of arms to equip his English supporters.[104] The Dutch army was composed mostly of foreign mercenaries; there were Dutch, Scots, English, German, Swiss, and Swedish regiments, even Laplanders[101] as well as ""200 Blacks brought from the Plantations of the Netherlands in America"",[116] thus from the colony of Surinam. Many of the mercenaries were Catholic.[117] William had his personal guard regiment with him, the Dutch Blue Guards. In response to the threat James had raised five new regiments of foot and five of horse, as well as bringing in Scottish and Irish soldiers. Louis XIV also sent James 300,000 livres.[118]


&gt; The French fleet remained at the time concentrated in the Mediterranean, to assist a possible attack on the Papal State.[101] Louis delayed his declaration of war until 16/26 November hoping at first that their involvement in a protracted English civil war would keep the Dutch from interfering with his German campaign. The same day a second attempt by Legge to attack the landing site again failed by an adverse southwestern gale.[70] The Dutch call their fleet action the Glorieuze Overtocht, the ""Glorious Crossing"".[119]

&gt; William considered his veteran army to be sufficient in size to defeat any forces (all rather inexperienced) that James could throw against him, but it had been decided to avoid the hazards of battle and maintain a defensive attitude in the hope James's position might collapse by itself. Thus he landed far away from James's army, expecting that his English allies would take the initiative in acting against James while he ensured his own protection against potential attacks. William was prepared to wait; he had paid his troops in advance for a three-month campaign. A slow advance, apart from being necessitated by heavy rainfall anyway, had the added benefit of not over-extending the supply lines; the Dutch troops were under strict orders not even to forage, for fear that this would degenerate into plundering, which would alienate the population.

&gt; On 9 November (Julian calendar) William took Exeter after the magistrates had fled the city, entering on a white palfrey, with the two hundred black men forming a guard of honour, dressed in white, with turbans and feathers.[120] In the South support from the local gentry was disappointingly limited,[121] but from 12 November, in the North, many nobles began to declare for William, as they had promised, often by a public reading of the Declaration.[122] In Yorkshire, printer John White started to print the same document for a more widespread distribution.[123] However, in the first weeks most people carefully avoided taking sides; as a whole the nation neither rallied behind its king, nor welcomed William, but passively awaited the outcome of events. In general, the mood was one of confusion, mutual distrust and depression.[121]

Most regions. I think around 80% of population that live outside a big/known city live in these conditions. And this doesn't stop here.

It's important to understand that the Karabakh conflict was never a land conflict.

It all started with Azerbaijan leaving the Soviet Union. The Soviet army attacked Azerbaijan from the Armenian territories to keep the country under control.

Russian military is still based in the occupied territory. Russia has no intent to stop the conflict it's benefiting from.

The most recent very similar strategy was executed in Crimea by Russia. Just to keep the country under control.

Today all 3 parties Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan are benefiting from the conflict. It is a very good distraction from internal problems for Armenia and Azerbaijan. To Russia the conflict is the way to control both countries and sell a lot of weapons to both sides.

So it doesn't really matter which side EU or any other country chooses.  
The only way to stop it is to completely change political systems of these countries.

People you see on the videos are simple people. They watch TV and see only what they are being served. Hate. The same is happening in Armenia. People are being taught hate from school.

818," 

Apple have one branch in Europe. It is a branch of a company tax resident in the US under Irish rules (and under the rules of the vast majority of modern states) because it is managed and controlled in the US. Most states look at management and control rather than where a company was incorporated because otherwise a company could incorporate in a tax haven and operate in e.g. Ireland and pay no tax. Ireland taxes every company based on where it is managed and controlled and where the profits are generated without having any regard to where the company was created/incorporated. Bahamas incorporated company or Irish incorporated company the rules are exactly the same.

Irish law provides that where a non-resident company has a branch in Ireland the company is liable on the profits earned by that branch, even though the company as a whole is not taxable on its profits. the branch in Cork has about 6,000 employees who work mainly on building apple mac desktops and packaging and distributing other products to ship to people who have bought them from other branches. Ireland assessed the profits generated in this branch and charged tax on that. The tax opinions concerned the mechanism for calculating the profits of the branch.

Commission accepted that the company was not tax resident in Ireland so only the profits generated in the Cork branch were liable to Irish tax, but decided that the branch in cork generated the entirety world-wide profit of apple excluding sales in the US. Every other sale went through this us resident company and the Commission decided all that profit was down to the genius of the workers in cork. Never mind that they are chronically underpaid for employees of such brilliance that they single-handedly generated all of Apple's worldwide profits, yet they were paid tiny money compared to the 50,000 wasters in Cupertino in the US who are paid far more but generated none of the profits. They didn't reach this conclusion by seeing anything in the cork branch capable of generating the profit, they reached it by saying well we don't see anything in the rest of the company that could generate the profit so it must be generated in cork. At the same time as deciding that all the profits were generated by this branch and therefore liable to irish tax they also said, well maybe these profits are actually generated and taxable elsewhere, so invited other member states to look for a piece of the pie in what was totally not a bribe at all. 

The 13 billion is 12.5% (irish corporation tax rate) of the total circa €104 billion profit generated by the us based company with an Irish branch over ten years. The &lt;1% tax rate the commission likes to generate headlines about is the irish tax charged on the profit attributable to the packing, manufacturing and distribution activities of the Cork branch as a percentage of the Apple companies €104 billion worldwide profit over this ten year period.

Ireland and Apple said ""WTF?""

They appealed to the Courts who said ""WTF?"" Being a court they said so a little more politely and over the course of 92 pages.

&gt; Home sweet home: How popular is domestic tourism in Great Britain?				

-

&gt; Why are people holidaying at home?

-

&gt;In 2018, the number of domestic visits was over 50% higher than the number of foreign trips. The popularity of staycations in recent years has been attributed to:
&gt;
&gt;* The fall in the value of the pound. The travel website, Lonely Planet found the cost of travelling abroad was expected to become more expensive, causing more people to stay in the UK. The average cost for a couple to travel abroad would be £987.50, compared to £574.10 to stay in the UK (found in a survey by the website VoucherCodes).
&gt;
&gt;* Heatwaves. The higher temperatures have encouraged people to stay in the UK for holidays. According to The Sykes Staycation Index 2019, over 1 in 10 had planned to holiday in the UK in 2019 because of the warmer weather.
&gt;
&gt;* Brexit. A poll by Travelodge found that 58% of respondents have chosen to have their holidays in Great Britain due to ‘Brexit uncertainties’.

Hair herded the prisoners out of the draw and asked 1st Lieutenant Blanks what he should do with them. Blanks, in turn, asked Compton for instructions. Compton asked Blanks if he was sure that they were the same snipers that had been shooting at them all day. When Blanks answered in the affirmative, Compton said bluntly, ""Get them shot.""

1058,"&gt; You literally said that this was a choice between a centre-right candidate and a right-wing one. Which it was not.

I did not. I said it was a choice between an EPP and an ECR candidate, and that both are to the political right of the center, both of which are true. The candidates positions relative to the polish overton window aren't usefull for discussion outside of the context of exclusively polish politics.

I would also never describe PiS as 'just' right wing.

&gt;Exactly the contrary, using pan-European qualifiers throughout the discussion will result of complete misunderstanding of the issue being talked about, and leave someone not knowing anything about Polish politics, even less knowledgeable than he was to begin with, as he will be left with a completely wrong picture of how this election was - which in my opinion is worse than having no picture.

Someone who has no idea of polish politics, but is familiar with european politics in some form, would get the wrong idea about a candidates policies if you told them they are considered center-left, it's that simple.

&gt;The wider frame is useless, because Polish politics does not operate according to ""pan-European"" frame of reference

The frame of refrence provided by polish politics is a sub-frame of the pan-european frame. That is to say, everythong encompassed by the polish frame is also encompassed by the pan-European frame. As such, saying that polish political parties cannot be classified in a pan-European frame is the same as saying they cannot be classified in a polish frame, which is nonsensical.

&gt;But they would be radical - around here. As in - unable to pass the electoral threshold and get anyone into parliament,

Viabillity as a party does not influence the parties position on a 1-dimenesional spectrum. We've got communists here in Germany too, and not one of them will ever be elected. That doesn't mean their position on the german or pan-European political spectrum changes.

&gt;I'm sure PiS would be radical wherever you live, and party like Konfederacja would be unthinkable, but around here one is a vanilla, default political position

Which doesn't change their policy at all. You do understand that this isn't about which parties you like, or how well they fulfill an abstract definition of 'good', right?

&gt;A good analogy would be saying elections in Western Europe are a contest between various versions of commies, which is what you would get if you applied American political spectrum to them

The difference here is that the contemporary european spectrum encompasses the majority of historically relevant political ideologies. Meanwhile, the contemporary US only has a smaller subset of those ideologies. We should always use the widest frame available, so that we are able to classify as many parties in as usefull a way as possible. In both the polish and the american frame, a radical socialist party would be classified as efectively equivalent to a communist party, even though the two have significant differences in policy and worldview.

The question isn't who's paying, it's who is winning and losing. In this case smaller countries who cannot afford to subsidize lose out to bigger tax bases like Germany who can afford to prop up gigantic institutions. 

The European findings themselves showed Ireland would have been unlikely to owe any of the tax funding to EU countries but rather the American exchequer lost out. Most of the money is not claimed by Ireland, but it was never made out that that was the intent of the policies. It was always about economic modernization, a goal successfully achieved.

I can think of one example what happens when press does not follow the rules. Finland was introducing new legislation regarding the rules how police and military intelligence are allowed to secretly collect information on private citizens. In 2017, a newspaper published an article which contained some information that the army said was secret. As a result at least one journalist had their home raided by police. Apparently the journalist tried to destroy their computer to protect their source - only to get accused of destroying evidence. If I remember correctly, the highest court ruled in favour of the police. Not sure if there are still ongoing court proceedings.

1422,"&gt;If i own a house worth 50k and make 800 euros a month, then according to  this misleading map i am wealthier than someone that makes 4k a month  and pays 1000 in rent.

If you own 50k and the other person doesn't even own 10k, then you are indeed more wealthy. It doesn't matter what either of you earns. Chances are quite good the other person will eventually become more wealthy than you though.

This is from the source:

&gt;Wealth is the total sum value of monetary assets and valuable material  possessions owned by an individual, minus private debt, at a set point  in time.

To even buy a small apartment here in Iceland you and your partner need to have accumulated around €60k before you even get a loan. That's for the smallest, cheapest apartments, costing around  €250k each. After taking the loan your personal wealth is somewhere around €60k - €250k = negative €190k.

This map accounts for that.

Almost everyone I know in their late 30s and up are worth at least €100k. It's just not *that* much money over here. Well, not to most people. We of course have poor people like everyone else. They generally don't own their own house/apartment and are forced to rent.

In Swedish schools, you're allowed to speak Finnish and a small assortment of other official minority languages. The problem appears when you've got a school where there are students with mother tongues that aren't recognized as official minority languages.

You'll have kids complaining about being oppressed and being treated unfairly when they see kids at the school being allowed to speak Finnish while they aren't allowed to converse in their tongue. The school most likely don't want to deal with that shit.

&gt; In times of recession, deficit spending has significant benefits, whereas spending cuts by governments aggravate and lengthen recessions.[3][4][5][6][7][8] To prevent that, most balanced-budget provisions make an exception for times of war, national emergency, or recession, or allow the legislature to suspend the rule by a supermajority vote. 

Or this.... 

&gt; In November 2011 the Austrian coalition government tried to amend its constitution and introduce a German style Schuldenbremse (""debt brake""). This would have forced the government to reduce its debt level to 60% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020.

I'm not well off but I dress well, I dont spend a great deal on clothes I buy for quality and smartness, I have a 1 bed flat in a nice area,  I could have a 3 bed house for the same price 2 miles down the road but its a shithole,  and If i say thats where i come from i will instantly be judged, the people queuing at the job centre are wearing £120 trainers and £150 + tracksuit and have phones at twice the cost of mine,  I buy real leather high quality returns shoes from a specialist place, for less than £20 a pair, I sale shop and very very rarely spend more than £30 an item but people would know to look at me I'm from the area I live in by my choice of clothes and would instantly perceive me to be better off, when I say I live where I do I get ""ohhh ain't you posh"" ...............  when in actual fact I'm no better off than those down the road.

- This dude Ahmed Dogan, an ex communist secret police agent is said to rule the country behind the curtains, and he's having a political party that should be illegal.

-As the other dude already said - Dogan has mansions, which are guarded by the state agency, which is also not right and against the law. And this Hristo Ivanov (political leader and also a lawyer) tried to go a public beach, but was stopped by a state security agency, and this beach seems to be ""stolen"" by Dogan and added to his mansion.

-The government and the police, also the president, were all pretending they don't know what is happening. Which probably means Dogan has power over them.

-Our prime minister has million in euro - cash - in his night stand. Also probably kilograms of gold and a gun. Photos (real) were leaked. And Bulgaria is the poorest in the EU.

-There's corruption and the situation as a whole is shitty.

- The government says - fuck the president. The president says - fuck the government. (The president should stay a-political, so to speak)

-And in the end everyone wants to get to rule the country because there are billions and billions to be stolen. Eurofunds and stuff.

Snippets from the Grimm Brothers version of *Cinderella*:

https://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm021.html

&gt;The next morning, he went with it to the man, and said to him, ""No one shall be my wife except for the one whose foot fits this golden shoe.""
&gt;
&gt;The two sisters were happy to hear this, for they had pretty feet. With her mother standing by, the older one took the shoe into her bedroom to try it on. She could not get her big toe into it, for the shoe was too small for her. Then her mother gave her a knife and said, ""Cut off your toe. When you are queen you will no longer have to go on foot.""
&gt;
&gt;The girl cut off her toe, forced her foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the prince. He took her on his horse as his bride and rode away with her. However, they had to ride past the grave, and there, on the hazel tree, sat the two pigeons, crying out:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;*Rook di goo, rook di goo!*
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;*There's blood in the shoe.*
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;*The shoe is too tight,*
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;*This bride is not right!*
&gt;
&gt;Then he looked at her foot and saw how the blood was running from it. He turned his horse around and took the false bride home again, saying that she was not the right one, and that the other sister should try on the shoe. She went into her bedroom, and got her toes into the shoe all right, but her heel was too large.
&gt;
&gt;Then her mother gave her a knife, and said, ""Cut a piece off your heel. When you are queen you will no longer have to go on foot.""
&gt;
&gt;The girl cut a piece off her heel, forced her foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the prince. He took her on his horse as his bride and rode away with her. When they passed the hazel tree, the two pigeons were sitting in it, and they cried out:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;*Rook di goo, rook di goo!*
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;*There's blood in the shoe.*
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;*The shoe is too tight,*
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;*This bride is not right!*
&gt;
&gt;He looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking all red. Then he turned his horse around and took the false bride home again.
&gt;
&gt;""This is not the right one, either,"" he said. ""Don't you have another daughter?""
&gt;
&gt;""No,"" said the man. ""There is only a deformed little Cinderella from my first wife, but she cannot possibly be the bride."" 

-

&gt;When the wedding with the prince was to be held, the two false sisters came, wanting to gain favor with Cinderella and to share her good fortune. When the bridal couple walked into the church, the older sister walked on their right side and the younger on their left side, and the pigeons pecked out one eye from each of them. Afterwards, as they came out of the church, the older one was on the left side, and the younger one on the right side, and then the pigeons pecked out the other eye from each of them.

1700,"As the choreography of culture wars goes, it cannot be faulted. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, last week decreed that the 1,500-year-old Hagia Sophia, the Byzantine cathedral-turned-mosque-turned-museum, will once again become a mosque. This crown jewel of Istanbul’s majestic skyline is being weaponised for the purpose of mass distraction.

Mr Erdogan, the towering figure of Turkey this century, has won more than a dozen electoral victories to sweep aside a parliamentary system with an authoritarian presidency that allows him to rule like a neo-Sultan. He is nevertheless under political stress.

Last year his winning streak was checked by opposition triumphs in Istanbul — the city essential to his mystique, where he had his political start as mayor — the capital Ankara, and a string of other important urban centres. These proved he is politically mortal.

This year, the coronavirus pandemic has piled strain on to a faltering economy. Mr Erdogan’s success has more to do with his record of delivering strong economic growth than his Islamist revivalism. The ability to provide trumps identity politics. That is doubly so now that the city governments run by his enemies have outperformed national government in the Covid-19 emergency.

The Hagia Sophia decree is about more than religious chauvinism. It is calibrated to rally far-right nationalists on whom Mr Erdogan increasingly depends. Anticipating the outcry from abroad, from Pope Francis to Patriarch Kirill of Russia, from Unesco to the EU, from the White House to the Kremlin, Mr Erdogan had his answer ready: “Are you ruling Turkey or are we?”

Yet this preaching to the converted probably has limited value at home. Nor will it endear Mr Erdogan to his strongman friends: President Vladimir Putin in Russia, who has assumed the role of champion of the Orthodox Church worldwide, or President Donald Trump in the US, who will rely on evangelical Christian voters for his re-election in November. In Europe, if Turkey’s EU accession bid was already moribund, the Hagia Sophia decree is probably its death certificate.

Hagia Sophia was completed in 537 by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, before the advent of Islam. It became a mosque after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople (later Istanbul) in 1453. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founder of the Turkish republic, then turned it into a museum in 1934. Reclaiming it as a universal legacy for Turkey was a plural gesture, pointing to a secular future, in part to shift attention away from how the collapsing Ottoman Empire emptied Turkey of Christians in mass killings of Armenians, Assyrians and Greeks.

It is a reminder that identity politics gets especially lethal when laced with religion. Yet there are different comparative examples. Jerusalem is historically the most contested and combustible space in the world, a thrice holy city to Jews, Christians and Muslims, all of whose traditions are in the grain of its stone. It has also seen horrendous carnage. When Christian crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099, they slaughtered an estimated 70,000 Muslims and Jews. But Jerusalem has also been an arena of courtesy and tolerance.

When Muslim armies defeated the Byzantines in Syria and conquered Jerusalem in 637, Umar, the second caliph after the death of the Prophet Mohammed, refused an invitation from the patriarch to pray in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which Christian tradition holds housed the tomb of Jesus before resurrection (and is itself built on the ruins of a Roman temple to Aphrodite).

Umar feared it might be seen as a signal to turn the church into a mosque. He also cleared the refuse from Temple Mount, called by Umar the sanctuary of David, but used by the Byzantines as a stable.

This showed an understanding that emotive sacred tradition is not to be trifled with. Even today, after Israel has annexed and colonised Arab East Jerusalem, and won Mr Trump’s recognition of all of the Holy City as Israel’s capital, the Israelis enforce a ban on non-Muslims praying within the Holy Sanctuary or in Haram al-Sharif housing the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa mosque, Islam’s third holiest site.

A contrasting example is the Babri Masjid case at Ayodhya in northern India. There, a 16th-century mosque was demolished in 1992 by followers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu supremacist parent organisation of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party. Narendra Modi, India’s current prime minister, is a life-long member of the RSS. In November last year, India’s supreme court gave the go-ahead to build a temple on the mosque’s ruins to Lord Ram, the Hindu deity whose birthplace they claim it was.

But will this triumphalist moment be held tantalisingly out of reach, to keep the Hindu revivalist base mobilised? Or will it be acted on to intimidate India’s 200m Muslim minority, painted as fifth columnists who bow to Mecca?

These two cases provide stark alternatives for Mr Erdogan to choose between. He seems to prefer the Modi model of painting Turkey’s big Sunni Muslim majority as victims. Not for him the humane formula of the Caliph Umar in Jerusalem, let alone Ataturk’s universal solution for Hagia Sophia, offering it to those of all religions, or none.",,/r/europe/comments/hrdvl9/the_hagia_sophia_decree_is_about_more_than/fy3htx9/,Lost_Channel,1594774453

I was talking about the reality that my own state's intelligence services have oversights, and there are checks and balances in place. It's a matter of public record, a public part of my government, parts of which I have seen broadcast ocassionally, and I'm not trying to convince you of it. I hope your own government has the same.

Europeans, our leaders, and governments publically criticise the USA all the time. Their current president even more so. So I agree that suggesting that we don't criticise the USA would be ridiculous.

We are already in a game of blind belief. The vast majority of the population will never have any idea of the true extent of such matters. Neither you nor I know the truth of events. The question is do you trust our democracies with our checks and balances, or do you trust the CCP who publically murder their own citizens for being informants?

We just arrest people for that here.

Who said the threats are only about backdoors and spying? The British companies said that they will struggle to replace existing Huawei equipment, that it will take years to remove and replace everything. So what would happen if the CCP suddenly cuts off supplies of repair parts to a country that relies upon them? A big part, or all, of their 5G could go down. Dependance on the CCP can harm a foreign country too, it can be used as leverage to blackmail countries.

Nor does the lack of security breaches so far mean that there are no links between Huawei and the CCP's military the PLA. There is no causal link, you haven't actually provided reasoning as to how the lack of security breaches found so far disproves links between Huawei and the CCP's PLA.

Didn't take long to find out that Boris himself made the last decision in January, after a review, to allow Huawei to be a part of the network. He just now made another decision to ban Huawei. So same person, no leadership change. Why suggest that it was due to a leadership change?

&gt;Both the US and France have had fast breeders, Russia has two operational fast breeders currently, where one is used in commercial operation(BN-800), and both China and India are currently building theirs.

The US and France didn't pursue it, which should clue you in about the usefulness, since they had the money, expertise, and will to pursue nuclear power.  The Russian one can't run without special nonstandard patchwork by a team of scientists to stop it from leaking. China and India are building their own *experimental versions*. By the time the results of these are in we're a decade later. Even assuming they all get it right immediately this time, it takes a decade more to build the demonstration models and test them. Then it takes, again, more time to set up the industry to produce them. Then it takes more time to ramp up. And that's assuming they're not needing substantial quantities of exotic materials to make it all work, making them more expensive if not downright impossible. And *then* you have to get lucky that all the models, by some stroke of genius, all stay in working condition for the expected time. And that it's not abused for proliferation. Or for making dirty bombs, because breeders produce large amounts of funky isotopes; it's not like you put in a block of thorium and take out a block of uranium 5 minutes later. It all has to be centrifuged and refined, producing an ever-growing mountain of nuclear waste that *theoretically* could be bred, but won't be, because it's just too goddamn expensive and it will always be cheaper to use new raw materials and fob off the waste problem to the next administration, or just lock it away and forget about it. But those piles have a tendency to assert themselves sooner or later by leaking into inconvenient places.

&gt;""Extraction of uranium from seawater has been studied in various countries of the world. This extraction should be carried out parsimoniously. An extraction rate of 103 tons of U per year for a MSR park of 500 MSRs over centuries would not modify significantly the equilibrium uranium concentration (3.3 ppb) in the oceans, resulting from the input of 104 tons of U per year by river waters and its scavenging on the sea floor from the 1.37 × 1018 tons of water in the oceans.""
From Issue 7, 2019 ""Journal of Sustainable Energy and Fuel""

There are half a dozen articles about seawater among the references, please link directly to one that has investigated the replenishment rate, and dispersement rate of the replenishment, instead of making assumptions.

But really, 103 tons? That's about 0,14% of world uranium consumption at current rates. FYI, that's good for 14% of electricity production and 4% of total energy production. So that setup would produce 0,0056% of the current world's energy needs. Are you going to build 17857 of those installations? And does that replenishment scale up if you try to do it not just once but 17857 times per year?

Again, this is like the steam engine in Roman times: a cute curiosity, but of little practical use currently.

1839,"&gt; No tolerance for intolerance

""Less well known is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.—**In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise.** But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.""

Maybe you believe that PiS and its voters are too far gone, maybe you believe that anyone in the other direction of the political ideological spectrum is too far gone, and you think that those you deem intolerant are unable to meet you on the level of rational argument. You are probably getting caught up on that part, and thinking it is justifiable now to ""claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force"". Have you considered how they feel? How your reason differs from theirs, how their arguments appear more rational to them than yours? Why do you get to decide that they are intolerant? I would ask them the same thing. The issue with the paradox of tolerance is that anyone can say they are the ones claiming the right to not tolerate the intolerant. They can call themselves the tolerant, and in doing so they can call any opposition the intolerant. For example, ""They may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols."" If you think this is only applicable to groups in opposition to your values, you are wrong. This line of behavior is apparent in all kinds of organizations, parties, religions, etc.

This is not what I want to emphasize though. The part in bold, regarding ""I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies"" and keeping them in check with rational argument. If you are not countering the ""intolerant"" successfully, there may very well be issues with their reception of your supposed rational argument, but if you forgo the responsibility to follow through with your logic and reason when countered with their opposing arguments, will you ever get through to them? Why would one not press them? Dead-end arguments are common, opinions are not changed through discussion which ends in poor conduct and intellectual dishonesty. In the more civil instances those involved can agree to disagree, but people are hardly civil, reasoning, or respectful when it comes to arguments surrounding intolerance. It can be taken very personally depending on the kind of argument. One won't look inwards when recommended to by their opponent, and this goes for all kinds of ideas or values that are held.

When these arguments fail, it may be indicative of public opinion failing to keep them in check, or it may not. People are so lost these days that they have a hard time perceiving their reality and the world around them. What happens when we cannot see eye to eye, and we can't trust anything around us? We know something is wrong but we cannot come to an agreement on what. Why is it this way and where can we go from here? Are we doomed to descend into violence and destruction? This hyper partisanship, this ideological divide, the ""with us or against us"" mentality, it all is culminating to the problems in the world today. Nobody can agree on who the oppressors are, yet we all keep pointing fingers. This is very apparent in a place like America. Is it the state? Is it the culture? Is it white people? Is it immigrants? Is it Republican, or Democrat? Is it the media? Is it the corporations? Is it the rich? Who exactly is responsible? Who exactly is to blame? Who gets to decide? Who gets to prosecute?

Safety from Lunatics, 2nd Amendment! 1st Amendment, Hate speech! Sexual Liberation, Religious Freedom! Pro Life, Pro Choice!

What will happen if this continues is not going to be one-sided effort or one-sided escalation. Continue to ask yourself at every opportunity who exactly is tolerant and of what. Also, ask yourself what *they* are intolerant of. It is a good thing to think about as tensions increase. Maybe eventually you will understand the values of the so-called intolerant you cannot stand.

The Dutch tax authority enables companies to shift profits (for instance royalties) that are earned in other countries to the Netherlands in transactions that have no economic merit. The Netherlands plays very little role in the production of the IP / profiting from the IP relative to the portion that is taxed there. If countries offer tax deals to employees, the employee moves to and the production actually happens in that country. So the difference is the fact that one means production / resources are really shifted while one is just a way to enable accounting.

Btw the NL itself also uses special tax deals for foreigners to try to encourage people to move there.

1893,"&gt; I trust my own state's checks and balances. We have sufficient oversight to satisfy me that the decisions are based upon valid evidence. I'd always happily support correct oversight of our intelligence services.

What if the oversight is just as corrupt to accept lack of evidence?

&gt; So I do have sufficient evidence that my state's intelligence services are more trustworthy than not.

I think we are once again talking about having evidence while not providing any.

&gt; If you think that the US is the only country with spies in China, then clearly the rest are doing a good job at being discreet. I haven't seen any European democracy's intelligence services deny the CCP's abuses though. Many know and acknowledge it, but are too spineless to even criticise.

Alternatively they disagree with US statements and are just as spineless to criticize them. It's the problem of lack of evidence, we enter a game of what-if and of blind belief. I dont think this is even the case though, I think other countries dont speak up primarily because they have their own interests against China so they dont even care about US statements as long as people believe in them.

&gt; I know nothing about him, nor do I care about his comments on coronavirus. People can be wrong about some things, and right about others. His statements regarding Huawei are not a lone unreliable voice, or contrary to other reliable sources. The matter of Huawei falls well within his area of expertise.

You dont care about his comments about covid19 but doesn't bother you one bit that the person you rely for information regarding Huawei easily spreads misinformation for political reasons?

How about we actually ask specialists in the field? Huawei is the only telecom company in the UK with a research center that lets UK personnel study it for possible backdoors, to this day they have found none under the GCHQ.

&gt; Britain is able to manage the security risks of using Huawei telecoms equipment and has not seen any evidence of malicious activity by the company, a senior official said on Wednesday, pushing back against U.S. allegations of Chinese state spying.

1910,"The reason to fight China isn't just in their treatment of Hong Kong. It's due to the fact that they are becoming a power to rival the USA and will likely kick them off their throne in the long run. Hong Kong is just a good example how little China cares anymore about how they are perceived by the international community.

While the USA has it's flaws, it doesn't have a brutal dictatorship that systematically spies on and controls every aspect of their citizens lives and builds work camps for undesirable minorities. China's party CPC also has increasingly expressed the expectation of other countries to suppress their free press after the latter wrote badly about China, so it's quite obvious that their interests and expectations of obedience aren't just limited to China but will long term stretch over the globe.

Currently we are in a position where we can slow this effect down by economically isolating them until their system hopefully changes or collapses. The longer we wait the harder this will be, as we already are highly intertwined with their economy and it will only increase the stronger their economy gets.

On a side note: Until the African countries fix their internal issues and form somewhat stable and democratic leaderships it's not very meaningful to support them. Currently many African countries are ripe with strife and corruption and the money transfered there will just get taken by the local warlords and used to buy more weapons or draw more citizens into their conflicts.

My personal belief was that it was 'max state capitalism' in the sense that it was not accidentally harsh or deliberately evil, like Stalinist Russia or Nazi Germany (or Belgium), but it was cruel through its pursuit of commercial goods. It didn't cut the hands off workers in the Congo, that would be immoral. But those that were rebelling against the crown lost their rights to humanity and, well, *life* in the worlds first modern internment, labour and concentration camps. The Empire was not tame in the same way Rome was not tame: it was a terrible system and morally evil but when an empire becomes so large and so influential, it's morality and effect on the world is almost pointless questioning.

I expect the Austrians to get a larger rebate than they currently have (it's really small) and that the size of the COVID fund will go down and there will be some conditions attached to it.

You do have a point about the 40's, at the time of Winter War.

Quebec could be considered a French settler colony. It is fairly succesful.

South Africa was also a (Dutch) settler colony, to mixed results I'd say.

Gabon, Liberia and Sierra Leone are a form of settler colonies (for freed slaves). Of those I think Gabon is most successful.

&amp;#x200B;

Other traditional fairy tales are harder to explain or even find a good moral explanation.  Take Rumplestiltskin.  The father bizarrely makes a crazy promise about his daughter being able to spin hay into gold.  She's saved from what sounds like an arsehole King who tells her he'll kill her unless she can spin him gold by the morning, by Rumpelstiltskin, but doesn't hold her side of the bargain about giving her child to him.  Somehow she's happy to marry this King, who now clearly doesn't care that she isn't able to repeat her previous performances.  It all doesn't hang together very well, and I struggle to find a good moral there.

Them not being economically viable currently does not make them ""science fiction"". Both the US and France have had fast breeders, Russia has two operational fast breeders currently, where one is used in commercial operation(BN-800), and both China and India are currently building theirs. Going by your logic, battery storage is still science fiction because they're not economically viable yet, nor currently relevant in the energy supply.

&gt; There is no data about how it scales economically and how quickly the supply in the seawater would replenish.

""Extraction of uranium from seawater has been studied in various countries of the world. This extraction should be carried out parsimoniously. An extraction rate of 103 tons of U per year for a MSR park of 500 MSRs over centuries would not modify significantly the equilibrium uranium concentration (3.3 ppb) in the oceans, resulting from the input of 104 tons of U per year by river waters and its scavenging on the sea floor from the 1.37 × 1018 tons of water in the oceans.""

2025,"Define ""northern countries"". (used google translate on the page) Sweden and Finland are neither in Nato, nor are they in the Mediterranean. Norway and Denmark are in nato but I guess they're protecting the northern part (of nato) from Russia? Well so does Sweden and Finland even if they're outside Nato. Nato and the Eu is not the same thing, and this article kinda think they are mutual. 

&gt;Southern Europe spends 2,000 million euros, double that of the north, in defending the Mediterranean

I mean... The northerns countries literally arent in the Mediterranean so why are they expected to protect it? Historically countries have only protected themselves and the area they are in. EU doesnt have its own army, defence is handled by the member states not EU. Thierry Breton tries to use eUrOpEaN sOlIdArItY as some way of shaming member states and people into accepting further integration that they don't want. 

Outer Eu borders are mostly handled by the member states too and you cant expect say Finland and Sweden to do the border protection for say Greece, sure we can send help or money through the EU or if the countries themselves want to give it directly but they arent obligated to nor should they be expected to.

The Mediterranean needs to be protected sure, illegal crossing through sea and land shall all be stopped and the borders against Turkey should be completely shut so they cant pressure anyone in the EU with millions of unwanted refugees. But at the moment border control is handled by the member states, not the EU nor Nato, Northern countries arent actually obligated to pay the Southern countries defence budgets or border control and they cannot be expected to either.

Some northern countries have also mishandled their armies a lot, spending too little money on them so they cant even protect themselves, which further shows that they cannot help the southern countries, some countries were gonna change. Some decided to stop budget increases and what not in the face of corona and at the moment the only country I know that still has decided to increase their defence budget is Sweden, increasing their defence budget from 1% of GDP to 1,5% of GDP and there are discussion of a even higher one and then there's also discussion for the 2026-2030 funding to be close to or over 2% of GDP",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/hr3x31/southern_european_countries_spend_twice_as_much/fy2cbcj/,weirdowerdo,1594753067

&gt;  
&gt;El pasado 10 de junio un buque de guerra turco escoltaba a un mercante con bandera de Tanzania que navegaba por el **Mediterráneo** rumbo a Libia. La **OTAN** sabía que llevaba armas para las milicias proturcas que defienden al Gobierno de Trípoli. Sobre Libia pesa un embargo de armas desde el pasado enero. El país está roto. Arrastra una guerra civil desde hace nueve años. La fragata francesa *Le Courbet* propuso interceptar el buque tanzano pero la armada turca se lo impidió con una maniobra intimidatoria. Francia presentó una queja a la OTAN, que se puso de perfil, como si nada hubiera pasado.

&gt;On juin 10th a turkish warship accompanied a merchant vessel flying the flag of Tanzania that navigated across the **Mediterranean** set for Lybia. **NATO** knew it carried weapons for the pro-turkish militias that defend the government of Tripoli even though there is a current weapon blockade in Lybia since january. The country is torn down. It has been on a civil war for nine years.

2132,"You are basically telling them to start shooting and hope for the best. That is not a strategy you can win a battle with. The whole issue is that the weapons they were given were completely ineffective and insufficient against the enemy they would be facing. So they resisted within their means (again, there were skirmishes in the days before, hence Mladic complaining to Karremans how he shot at him and his troops), but there was no way to win a full out battle with the troops and gear they had. The enemy had that superiority, since they were not stopped by the small skirmishes before and continued on.

&gt;What I'm saying is that a battalion commander cannot say ""let's airstrike that there"", and the refusal to do so at his request does not mean he won't receive adequate support if he's engaged in battle. It also doesn't mean he gets to throw his hands up in the air and say fuck it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again, support is not demanded by assigned.

You are now contradicting yourself. Your words from before:

&gt;I get a briefing on the overall situation, area of responsibility, I get my orders, commander's intent **and I'm given support.**

The troops we are talking about did not get support. And they did follow up on the intent, since the UN did not want them in a full out battle (hence the refusal to give support, since the UN was afraid that the Serbs would kill the soldiers taken hostage). Your expectations of the Dutch troops go fully against your own idea of how a mission should go, which should tell you already that they were destined to fail no matter what.

He did not just throw his hands up. He saw the situation and knew there was no way to win. The whole thing is a failure of the command and you want to pin it on the soldiers on the ground. Let's look at the events then:

[https://www.niod.nl/sites/niod.nl/files/XIII%20-%20Chronology%20of%20the%20Bosnian%20conflict%201990%20-%201995.pdf](https://www.niod.nl/sites/niod.nl/files/XIII%20-%20Chronology%20of%20the%20Bosnian%20conflict%201990%20-%201995.pdf)

&gt;July 6  
&gt;  
&gt;**Serbs shell Srebrenica** killing 4, wounding 17, **pin down Dutch peacekeepers, hit Dutch observation post with tanks, mortars, and hit refugee centre.** Serbs reported to be attacking N. and S. perimeters of enclave.  
&gt;  
&gt;July 8  
&gt;  
&gt;**Serbs launch tank, infantry assaults on Srebrenica** with dozens reported dead and wounded, NATO planes called in but not requested to attack. **Dutch observation post under attack and 15 forced to withdraw. 1 Dutch peacekeeper killed.** Serb shell hits line of people waiting for water in Sarajevo killing several.  
&gt;  
&gt;July 9  
&gt;  
&gt;UN officials tell Mladic that air strikes will be called for if Serbs continue attacks on Dutch peacekeeping force in Srebrenica **causing Dutch to return fire and stymie advance**. Serbs now hold 32 Dutch peacekeepers hostage. Serbs continue to bombard Sarajevo. 2,000 French enter Tomislavgrad area despite Croatia warnings against it.

There is your resistance over multiple days in fighting around the area.

&gt;July 10  
&gt;  
&gt;Serbs tell refugees in Srebrenica to leave safe area within 48 hours, some civilians already fleeing into hills. **Dutch peacekeepers fight with Serbs on outskirts of town, UN again declines to call in NATO air strikes due to hostages and British UN official says ‘the Serbs have limited aims’ in Srebrenica.** Serb guns hit Sarajevo and Zepa.

More fighting and the British seemingly unconcerned about it all. NATO is afraid to use air strikes and thus refuses to help Dutch soldiers on the ground.

&gt;July 11  
&gt;  
&gt;**Srebrenica falls to Serb forces**, NATO carries out 2 air strikes requested by Dutch after observation posts, UN base compound, and hospital come under fire. **Attack hits Serb tank but UN calls off 3 strike after Serbs threaten to kill 30 Dutch peacekeepers and Mladic promises to shell refugees.** Mladic says he wants to ‘demilitarize’ area and that civilians have nothing to fear if they stay. Serbs also threatening to take Zepa where 16,000 refugees are located. Silajdzic says UN failure is betrayal and sentence of death for people in Srebrenica. Thousands now fleeing to nearby Potacari **where Dutch forces remain even as Serbs continue shelling them.** Serbs shell UN headquarters in Sarajevo in response to air strikes. 5th Corps gains ground near Cojluk. Serb shells hit Catholic cathedral, residential area in Sarajevo

Nobody is running here. NATO is afraid to use more air strikes. Serbs have tanks available, peacekeepers on the ground have no material to hold the line against those considering they only have light arms available.

&gt;July 12  
&gt;  
&gt;French President Chirac calls for military action to recapture Srebrenica but he is not joined in this. Boutros-Ghali says UN force not capable of defending other Safe Areas, much less recover Srebrenica. President Clinton presses UN to keep troops in Bosnia even though they cannot carry out task. British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind says **‘with. must remain an option’** but also calls on Milosevic to pressure Bosnian Serbs to ‘behave in a more civilised fashion’. 

Blablabla from all allies, but nobody does anything other then deliver empty words. The French want actions, nobody cares. The British are fine with withdrawal and ask everyone to behave nicely. The US has already given up on the UN being in any way effective.

&gt;July 14  
&gt;  
&gt;Serbs begin full scale attack on Zepa, shell 3 UN positions in enclave, move tanks and infantry on town, **NATO jets fly overhead but do not attack. UN tells its force of 79 Ukrainian peacekeepers not to resist.**

The UN literally tells their soldiers to not resist. Once again, no air strikes also.

2227,"&gt;Just One thing: Covid aside, Italy has Always been an EU net contributor...

But really, what countries pay into the EU is literally a drop in the bucket of most economies in the EU. Netherlands pays 4.8 billion euros to the EU, which is a laughable amount considering the size of the national economy.

Italy spends about 10 billion to the EU, which is also peanuts considering the size of its economy.

The city of Amsterdam alone has a tram line that costed 3.1 billion euro, that should tell you how insignificant our counties contributions are to the EU, I don't think being a net payer is an argument at all.

Just the virtue of being a net contributor doesn't mean a common loan of something in the range of 200-500 billion euros would be smart. A loan that size could have way more impact on the financial stability of the lenders, especially if its not handled properly.

Another reason why the being a net contributor argument is not valid is because it steps on how much a country is pulling its weight. The frugals as you say, pay way more into it per capita like the fat behemoths like France and Italy. How is that fair that the population of those countries has to pay twice as much per capita as other countries, just because they are bloated with population and landmass? The only 2 successful big countries where Germany and unfortunately the UK.

I'm sorry for your grandparents fucking up your country so bad, and this is not only about Italy like the other poster is saying, France has been dragging its feet for a long time as well and should have been on par with Germany. That is maybe a tough pill to swallow for a lot of people.

2275,"&gt;Within older generations there is such a tendency, but within younger  people that is certainly not the case. There has been a shift in  historical approach over the last years, although I appreciate our  current leadership wouldn’t make that obvious.

That may be and I am not denying it, but countries are judged not by their domestic generetational stances, but what at the end comes out of it whole. And yeah, the current british government indeed is failing a bit in the mature department as well. But that just seems the result of a rather British (english?) development at large. A symptom, not the root cause, just like in the US.

&gt;I’m personally much more interested in the realities of those who live  in countries rather than the statues that adorn some streets. Even  within the statue debate in the UK, my priority has been those of slave  traders and working to have them removed, rather than that of a WW2  figure whom aggressively orchestrated retaliatory bombings.

Different topics here, really, though in the current climate easy to throw together, I give you that.

&gt;Britain is an increasingly diverse country, and despite the racial  tensions rising since Brexit it is still regarded by many as an  incredibly safe country for immigrants. Chinese artist Ai Weiwei moved  from Germany to the UK because of the unaddressed racism there, many of  my friends came to study in England and haven’t left because they’ve  found their identity is questioned far less here.

That is what they say about the US all the time. And again, though you are right, nobody outside really cares about the inner workings of these countries. We are still represented by our respective governments and have to deal with the fallout, if we voted for the guy or not. That, unforunately, is the reality of the nation state concept. People are collectivly responsible for their own leadership and are judged in this context. Not a friend of that, either, but these are the current realities.

&gt;I didn’t raise the issue of Pegida as a “whataboutism” but as a broader  symbol of Europeans use of the UK as a scape goat to avoid discussions  of their own history and current problems. I say this as someone who  holds passports for the UK, Ireland and France, and constantly is  questioned on the state of the UK as if we are the only country whom  have a turbulent past.

That argument would hold if similiar debates were not constantly happening between all kind of countries. the UK is not special in this regard. I rather feel the UK feels singled out here because the UK press (and i read a broad spectrum of ritish papers regularly) never report about any of these.

A similiar debate right now is about Poland and it's own conduct over the holocaust, while France on the other hand went much further and reviews it's own historty much more critical lately. 

Another reason why the UK gets targeted is the UK's attitude today, or at least over the last couple decades where they constantly presented themselves as the saviours of Europe (that falls to the Russians and Americans), paragorns of human rights and democracy, pointing fingers at others all the time, while in reality failing badly in all those ways vis á vis other countries. That attitude led to a lot of eye rolling and a backshlash these days. The uncritical way the UK deals with it's own past, both Empire and WW2, only adds to that. And yes, I know the argument of Empire being evil constnatly being rubbed into some people, but no matter what, it did not result in any rememberance or taking of responsebility what happend, it's just empty words, like in Japan. (and the same applies to the US and Russia, really, so no, the UK is not the only country you'd expect more of as a first world country based on enlighment)

The world has moved on and the UK appears to not have gotten the memo in many ways, what the nation state means, how WW2 is judged, how the past is viewd more critical these days, etc. 

And though you may be right, newer generations may percieve this differently, the current UK government is the embodyment of everything going wrong in the UK currently and feeds into the picture of the UK as a  country that never managed to move on and take a sober look into the mirror.

&gt;Germany has presented itself as a fair and progressive country, and in  many ways it is, yet the far rights presence is only increasing.  Personally I don’t think the AfDs 89 seat hold in the Bundestag is  discussed enough. The Burqah ban in France, The Netherlands, Austria,  Denmark and Belgium is too so often ignored.

Germany has it's own problems, and massivly so. We have problem with police and military being infiltrated by right wingers, we have Pegida and the AFD, so Germany certainly is no chill place in this regard. 

And as such I am not here to open up a penis size comparison into who deals better with the past or right wing populism. 

The same is true for other european countries. There still is lot to work on.

But the first step is to recognize those and not hide behind nationalistic defense reflexes when some outsider starts to critizise.

&gt;So no, I will not wait for any such group to erect statues, for I am  more concerned with the currently increasing presence of right wing  groups in Europe.

A few lightly armed UN peacekeepers without even a mandate to undertake the actions you ask of them, against a way larger and better armed enemy. Without support from command, since that has been denied. Tell me: how is that not suicide?

They had all the rights to defend themselves if they come under attack, that's why they're given weapons. 

I'm saying that they should have declined to hand over the people they were in charge of protecting, and if they came under attack they should have resisted within their means, until they either repel the attack or are rendered combat ineffective and forced to withdraw or surrender. 

I'm sure the Dutch military education has instilled into them some idea of how a mechanized battalion should perform a defense, so go try that.

Of course they cannot hold if they don't get any support and the VRS keeps piling on and building up fire superiority, but that did not happen, and the way I see it, it could have gone either way.

&gt;But you did! You say the tactic should have been to draw the enemy into a larger battle, so that command would come in with support or reinforcements, since the available troops were way too little to do anything

You're not describing a tactic, and I did not say such a thing. 

What I'm saying is that a battalion commander cannot say ""let's airstrike that there"", and the refusal to do so at his request does not mean he won't receive adequate support if he's engaged in battle. It also doesn't mean he gets to throw his hands up in the air and say fuck it.

[De facto banned in Spain since 2009.](http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Privado/rd716-2009.html#a5)



Article 5 Loan or credit limits

1. The loan or guaranteed credit may not exceed 60% of the appraised value of the mortgaged property, except for the financing of the construction, rehabilitation or acquisition of housing, in which it may reach **80%** of that value, without prejudice to the exceptions provided in the following section.

2. The limit of 80% to the relationship between the loan or guaranteed credit and the value of the mortgaged home mentioned in the previous section may be exceeded, **without exceeding in any case 95%**, if the mortgage loan or credit has a bank guarantee provided by a credit institution other than the creditor or is covered by credit insurance, in branch 14 of article 6.1 of Royal Legislative Decree 6/2004, of October 29, which approves the revised text of the Law on management and supervision of private insurance, provided by insurance companies. In any case, it will be the creditor credit institution who pays the cost of the bank guarantee or who appears as the policyholder and pays its cost. In no case may the cost of the bank guarantee or insurance be passed on to the mortgage debtor. The bank guarantee or insurance must in any case meet the following conditions:


Also the loans that are over 80% of the appraised value can't be use to create securities or sold to other banks.

I find quite surprising how unregulated this is in some countries. Don't your banks love to loan money to people without a regular income like ours?

Nowadays is pretty much impossible to get over 80%.

First Im not supporting these unethical and violent practices against journalists. All journailst must be free for their ideas. Even as a turkish citizen i didnt heard about her until today, which is pretty sad.

Second sharing terorism propaganda is not ok. Just think a news saying isis is doing good in your country, is it freedom of speech? I dont think so. And naked(semi naked generally) is common practice for the people who can be live bomb.

Then last after a quick search her reason for arrest is not ciriticising Turkish state,i did my quick search in a site about imprisoned journalists(against erdogan site,not turkish biased)( [https://expressioninterrupted.com/tr/asli-ceren-aslan/](https://expressioninterrupted.com/tr/asli-ceren-aslan/) ) This site is about her and you can find her words here but i can translate this event for you a little.

Example of freedom fighters news by özgürgelecek(which asli ceren aslan working) [https://www.ozgurgelecek.net/yps-nusaybin-kuruldu/](https://www.ozgurgelecek.net/yps-nusaybin-kuruldu/) 

First she detanied because of border violation and possible membership of a terrorist organization(PKK) in Turkish operations Syria. No one cant go jail because of border violation as her lawyer stated, and she is not member of terrorist organization but they didnt let her go until the case is over. while her trial continues they saw her News about Nusaybin and Cizre and jailed her because of terrorism propaganda. She didnt accepted it and say its freedom of speech and they were news made against the violence of the state.

You can want to make quick search about Nusaybin and Cizre, Two turkish city which PKK(terorirsts) declares its independence in 2015-2016, resulted a war between Turkey and pkk which causing many civilians to leave their homes.

So again think isis declared indepence on muberlin(germany),Just do empathy.

Germany historically has done far better regarding public infrastructure, that compensates for the low densities.

Combined with local governments that are responsive in failures of basic water/power infrastructure, and fairly invested public supervision in them, they've actually gotten away with it.

Germany has also put a lot more investment in it's ""second cities"", largely because it doesn't really have a ""capital city"" in anything but name, which have gotten a lot more infrastructure love between each other and onto themselves, in comparison to cities like Manchester and  Birmingham which, at least according to an article I read some time ago, the UK government has actually tried to slow down expansion until recently being accomodated as part of an enlarged London-centric investment area.

2469,"From Wikipedia:

&gt;In the early 1970s, the Ostpolitik (""Eastern Policy"") of ""Change Through Rapprochement"" of the pragmatic government of FRG Chancellor Willy Brandt, established normal diplomatic relations with the East Bloc states. This policy saw the Treaty of Moscow (August 1970), the Treaty of Warsaw (December 1970), the Four Power Agreement on Berlin (September 1971), the Transit Agreement (May 1972), and the Basic Treaty (December 1972), which relinquished any claims to an exclusive mandate over Germany as a whole and established normal relations between the two Germanys. Both countries were admitted into the United Nations on 18 September 1973. This also increased the number of countries recognizing East Germany to 55, including the US, UK and France, though these three still refused to recognize East Berlin as the capital, and insisted on a specific provision in the UN resolution accepting the two Germanys into the UN to that effect. Following the Ostpolitik the West German view was that East Germany was a de facto government within a single German nation and a de jure state organisation of parts of Germany outside the Federal Republic. The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognize the GDR de jure as a sovereign state under international law; but it fully acknowledged that, within the structures of international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state. By distinction, West Germany then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries, not only the de facto and de jure government, but also the sole de jure legitimate representative of a dormant ""Germany as whole"".[44] The two Germanys relinquished any claim to represent the other internationally; which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of each other as both capable of representing their own populations de jure in participating in international bodies and agreements, such as the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/hqww0q/european_countries_in_the_united_nations/fy0x3zf/,eestlane1990,1594724656

2520,"Under the baseline scenario of the latest population projections issued by Eurostat, the EU’s population will continue to grow older.

This can be illustrated by the **old-age dependency ratio, defined as the ratio of the number of elderly people (aged 65 years and over) compared with the number of people of working-age (15-64 years).**

The EU’s old-age dependency ratio is projected to be at 57% in 2100, almost double that of 2019 (31%). This means that there will be fewer than two persons of working age for each elderly person aged 65 and over.

By 2100, across the EU Member States, the old-age dependency ratio is projected to be highest in Poland (63%), followed by Italy, Malta and Finland (all 62%) as well as Croatia (61%).

At the other end of the scale, the lowest ratios are projected in Cyprus (52%), Sweden and Czechia (both 53%), Germany, Denmark and Belgium (all 54%).

NL is not rich because it's a tax haven, the percentage on GDP of foreign investment deriving from tax structure is very low.

Reducing taxes in the lower brackets of course reduces the average tax rate for everyone (including higher earners) if they pass through that bracket. It is a mere average calculation.

I omitted the US because they are a country with 330 million people, you should compare apples to apples.

Correlation means causation when the R squared explains a good portion of the phenomenon and the comparison is of common sense (if you look at the sources you will see that economic freedom explains respectively the 75% and the 40% of entrepreneurial dynamism and standard of living).

&gt; But the same is true for nuclear plants or even existing coal mining.

It's clear that nuclear plants aren't welcome anymore in Germany and many other places, but as far as I know they used to be mostly welcome, before the Chernobyl accident and the anti-nuclear movement spread fear.

An advantage of nuclear over wind is that one nuclear reactor produces as much electricity as hundreds of wind turbines, so it's much easier to keep the reactors a fair distance away from houses, although this isn't strictly necessary since it's not particularly dangerous to live near a nuclear power plant.

&gt; They need to destroy some villages in order to continue lignite mining.

That's one of the many reasons to switch from coal to nuclear. Uranium mining can also be problematic of course, but uranium has a much higher energy density than coal so you need less of it, and it can also be extracted from the sea (although it remains to be proven that this technology can scale).

&gt; Bavaria has a 10H rule. This means wind turbines need to be ten times as far away from any house, as they are high.

That's probably an excessive distance requirement, but I think it's also true that wind turbines can create risks and nuisances, so it seems to me that the law should prevent companies from putting them too close to houses.

&gt; So what? German electricity is still far cheaper with 70 €/MWh.

No, you're comparing apples and oranges. The strike price is how much UK consumers will pay for the electricity from Hinkley Point C during the first 35 years of operation, so I was comparing it to how much Germans currently pay for their electricity, to show that there's a significant margin for taxes and other costs on top of the strike price.

I haven't found an estimate of the LCOE of Hinkley Point C, but over the expected 60 years of operation it should be less than €70/MWh. As I understand it the LCOE of a nuclear reactor varies widely depending on the cost of capital. In other words, the LCOE of nuclear is high when investors want high profits. Of course a state that funds its own nuclear power plants doesn't need high profits, so the LCOE can be relatively low in that case. The theoretical minimum LCOE for HPC is probably around €20 per MWh if the cost of capital is zero.

&gt; We both know, that they are not perfect.

Nothing is perfect, but I don't see any reason to assume that the EU rules are imperfect enough to allow France and Sweden to cheat significantly.",France,/r/europe/comments/hny4wp/european_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions/fy0qnjy/,Changaco,1594718107

2680,"Duda - anti eu, anti lgbt, pro left economics
Tarzaskowski - pro eu, pro lgbt rights, not as pro left economics as Duda

Duda - Supported by PIS (party that currently have majority in government) 
Trzask - Supported by PO (party that ruled in coalition with other parties before lost to PIS in 2015

PiS (Duda):

- gave 500+ social program (500 PLN for every children each month), 
- shortly before election they also gave 13th retirement pension for 2019 year. 
- show itself as patriotic party. 

PO (Trzask):

- on economic scale it is more to the right than pis
- is more liberal than PiS 

Why Duda won?

- because PiS can push any law they want they push for law that allow them to ""buy votes"" 
- they gave 10 billion PLN to public television (500 million euro each year for next 5 years) - so public television is just propaganda TV for PiS - constantly attacking opposition parties. 
- many people did  not vote for Trzaskowski because they say that PO (Trzask) is as bad as PIS (Duda)

What will happen after election:

- more social programs 
- ""de-communism"" of the courts - PiS like to show itself as fighting against communism - however they assigned forper communist attorney as judge for Constitutional tribunal - this is just way for PiS to get power over courts.  
- ""repolonisation"" of the media (making media more Polish) -  continuing fight against media that are not pro-PiS
- probably more conservative laws, no equal laws for LGBT, harsher abortion law, 
- keep energy production from coal, no strong swing to renewable energy (they recently started talking about building nuclear power plant however it was new just days before 2nd election vote and they already had 5 years to start building it)",,/r/europe/comments/hqpehf/i_know_people_have_already_shared_several_maps_of/fy0jvl4/,Salvator-Mundi-,1594711210

2722,"In Bulgaria, both schools I went to had uniforms and both schools were state schools, not private. 

In the first one, there wasn't any uniform when I started, but at about 5th grade they implemented some vests with the school logo. They looked ridiculous, because they were a vest that you would wear with an official costume, you know, official trousers, an official shirt, an official jacket and official shoes, but of course kids didn't dress sharp, as you would expect and it was ordinary clothes with an official vest on top of them, which was really ridiculous. Sometime after I graduated from that school at 7th grade, they switched to a bright red sweatshirt with the school logo and kids look much better now and I kinda envy them, because I didn't have that.

At the second school, they had a dark blue shirt with thin black stripes (or black shirt with thin dark blue stripes, you can't really tell) and a light blue pullover vest to go on top of it, if you are cold. Some of my peers said that it was ugly, the teachers said students help design it, and I kind of liked it. They also allowed plain T-shirts in May and June, but they only allowed white, black, gray or blue T-shirts. I used to wear T-shirts throughout the whole year, because I didn't have anything else and I didn't want any trouble. They also allowed jeans without rips and for the girls they allowed skirts that went below the knee and shorts for both sexes that went below the knee, all plain of course. I stopped wearing the shirt, because I rarely saw anyone else wearing it.

The thing about these uniforms is that their enforcement wasn't very strict at that time, but if the teachers wanted to, they could land you in trouble for not wearing them. Most didn't, but sometimes some teachers would threaten to enforce the dress code, if the students misbehaved.

Another thing is that not all schools have uniforms or a dress code. I just happened to land in two schools that had them, but I know for a fact that not all schools have them.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/hqs6vc/school_uniform_laws_in_europe/fy0ax6d/,CyrillicUser1,1594703376

2773,"&gt;Since armenians who lived in west were not touched

The Genocide literally started with the deportation and murder of intellectuals in Istanbul of Western Anatolia (hence the remembrance date April 24), and continued with the genocide of Armenians including in the Western Anatolia (outside of the six villayets where most Armenians lived)

&gt;This comparing nazis to what happened to Armenians is like comparing a serial killer with a drunk driver.

The Jewish Lawyer, Raphael Lemkin, who literally created the term Genocide, used both the Armenian Genocide and the Holocaust as the defining examples. Each genocide can have different circumstances and methods, but they each still are terrible genocides.

And of course the Armenian Genocide was following on from decades of massacres, including the Hamidian and Adana massacres killing a quarter of a million Armenians (+extra Assyrians).

2805,"A lot of the discussion surrounding the campaign itself has been centred on PiS' and Duda's anti-LGBT rhetoric. While these comments were wrong, I think they have to be put into context. There was a lot of nasty rhetoric coming from both sides during this election campaign, and many prominent celebrities and some PO politicians made extremely disparaging results that certainly did not help Trzaskowski's cause. For example, during an appearance on a political talk show, the well-known actor Jerzy Stuhr claimed PiS voters were ""descenants of peasants"". Zbigniew Boniek, a famed footballer, lamented that ""the President of Poland may be chosen through the votes of the rural community, retirees, and people with an elementary education."" A former foreign affairs minister under the PO government quipped that ""PiS supporters' brains have different wiring,"" while in the leadup to the 2019 Parliamentary elections, a prominent author tweeted that male PiS supporters ""have vulgar faces and their women are no better"", and these comments reemerged in this election campaign. So the bottom line is both sides used very negative rhetoric, and I'm pretty sure that comments such as these certainly did not help Trzaskowski's cause. Many lukewarm PiS supporters were rightly angered by this level of contempt, and some voters who might otherwise have stayed home may have turned up to vote to voice their discontent and stand up for their dignity, which they felt was being insulted.",,/r/europe/comments/hpj41z/polish_presidential_election_round_two_megathread/fxzz6ur/,shydude92,1594695358

A credible link from the very beginning of the conflict. A factoid, which was later overturned by the fact that Putin admitted that there was a covert occupation already taking place at that moment. And I backed that up with a credible source. 

And the worst thing is that a user like u/Avroveks certainly must know that Putin has publicly acknowledged this...

* Opposition politicians rarely attack PiS voters (Sikorski is an exception from rule; it'd be hard to find any nasty quote from anyone important in current opposition politics);

* Majority of voters either side attack anyone, but there are vocal minorities which do, and on opposition side it includes some celebrities;

* In the end, research proves that opposition voters actually attack PiS voters more often, but they also **feel being attacked** more often. What they don't notice, is that they bounce attacks coming from PiS politicians towards PiS voters.

So in the end, PiS while provoking its' opponents, cynically achieves own voters being threatened by opposition. This is superb (sadly) case of fearmongering.

2865,"&gt; You think Trumps base would be sadden if he pulls US out of NATO and UN?

I agree, they would see it as a victory, the same as when he pulled out of the Paris Agreement, WHO, Open skies, etc, etc. What I was trying to suggest is that from my experience, his core base has little understanding of what these organisations actually do, why they were founded, and the power vacuum that gets immediately filled by Russia/China upon U.S departure.

&gt; Why do you think US would even want to be “influential”? This is the base that wants protectionism, isolationism, and America first.

I think this is really the crux of our disagreement. Imo you are really underestimating what ""influence"" brings to the United States, you guys aren't just a stronger version of the next world power, you literally control the world, economically, culturally and militarily.

This isn't something I'm upset about, it's just a fact. The stability that the U.S brings to global trade and security cannot be understated.

&gt; IT IS exceptional that the US seem to come up so much in European subreddit.

It would be strange if it didn't, I can't think of a single country that can afford not to care about who is calling the shots in the U.S.

&gt; I genuinely don’t get it. Maybe I just don’t have empathy. But I generally don’t think about foreign nation enough to feel this much about foreign leader.

Well... To be honest, you don't really have to care, the PM of the UK or any other leader can be completely ignored by the average American. Aside from perhaps mass political change in China/Russia it's never really going to matter (For now anyway).

&gt; Is Boris Johnson actually bad? Like at all? 

I've most often heard him described as a ""Trump-lite"", I do disagree with most of my left-leaning colleagues when they try to paint him as an idiot though, he's intelligent, effective at getting what he wants and understands the media/politics game extremely well.

The main dislike towards him is usually over the whole Brexit situation and the damage he's done to our relationship with Europe and the rest of the world, he's pretty much hated by every world leader except Trump.

2971,"The majority of Armenians serving Russia, were literally Russian-Armenians, subjects of Russia, in cases  fighting against Ottoman invasion (Battle of Sarikamish).

On  the other hand the thousands of Ottoman-Armenians served the Ottoman  empire, yet that provided no protection to their families from the  Genocide. Even decorated soldiers like [Mihran Mesrobian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihran_Mesrobian)   who fought against Russia and in the Balkans for the empire, served   directly under Ataturk but still lost his family as ""thanks"" like most   everyone else.

And it's not as though the Genocide was the only massacre, suddenly  happening. Armenians were being massacred for decades, the earlier  Hamidian and Adana massacre having a quarter of a million Armenian  victims themselves (in addition to Assyrians killed). Armenians were the  long-running ""wealth-hording"" scapegoats and the target of the empire.

Gas chambers wasn't the only method used. Jews were also “forcibly migrated” and killed in death marches, just like the Ottoman Armenians. FYI Jews did sabotage German military efforts, and rightfully so.

I'll give three of the most obvious examples of how low earners are benefiting. Firstly they get to pay very little income tax compared to the rest of the western world as high earners take the hit way more than in other countries. This combines with a high level of redistribution and government schemes which means that Ireland removes a lot of the inequality that would otherwise come with having so many high earners (as measured by the GINI index)

Second, Ireland has a higher percentage of income from corporate tax than almost everyone in the OECD. This made getting through the recession somewhat easier than it would be and right now is plugging  multibillion euro holes in our healthcare budget (as an example).

Finally, this income and employment played a fairly key role in balancing the budgets over the last few years and brought our credit rating back into the positive. Its because of this the government was able to bring in all the COVID employment benefits so quickly during the shitshow going on at the moment.

Said statue was funded by mostly veterans and placed outside the RAF church, from which you can view St Paul’s in the distance. Fleet Street, the area between the two churches, was repeatedly ravaged by German bombers which lead to the destruction of 60% of houses in London. Bare that in mind when considering the context of the people who wanted the statue erected.
I personally don’t agree with the Bomber Harris statue but can understand why it was erected at the time. Currently all statues in London are under review so we shall see what comes of it.

Due to the new travels difficulties caused by Brexit, the total number of visitors to France and Spain will probably decrease, due to the fact that the British are their main tourists in Spain and the seconds in France.

The United Kingdom will obviously suffer too, and Japan, which is eleventh, will probably take advantage of it and overcome the UK entering the top 10, also thanks to the Olympics that will give great visibility to the country in front of the eyes of the whole World.

Not at all actually, I've spent roughly an equal amount of time living in Europe as I have in the U.S. 

Do you honestly think Trumps base is watching anything other than fox news? do you really think if you were to ask Trumps core audience about any of the hugely embarrassing international fuckups and general loss of influence due to his administration that they'd be able to tell you all about it? I seriously doubt it.

&gt; Just because you’re nation is too poor or too unimportant to have all these media shit on you doesn’t mean it’s not there.

This is the type of rhetoric I've come to expect, I'm really not about to argue with an American over American exceptionalism. If you genuinely believe that the entire worlds media is shitting on the U.S. because other countries are ""too poor or too unimportant"" then there's no point in having a conversation (Also again, literally your closest allies lol).

&gt; At what point does the US become a normal nation? Because all I see is that so many in the world seem to have such expectation of US that they felt cut, they felt hit when we elected Trump. Like Americans are supposed to elect people liked by the world? That’s just so egotistical- it’s illogical and insane.

Try to understand, we live in an interconnected world, the ruling party in the U.S. can have broad consequences for everyone. The average person was likely just going to laugh at him being elected but as things have stretched on that laughter is turning into deeper concern.

You want to become a normal nation? to have respect again? it's possible, but you've honestly burnt so many bridges that it's never going to be the same, the world has seen that you just aren't reliable enough.

Bull fucking shit. You're being utterly ignorant here, and are 100% wrong, probably deliberately because it fits your agenda.

Here's some fun facts about [their manufacturing plant in Ireland](https://independent.ie/business/irish/revealed-eight-facts-you-may-not-know-about-the-apple-irish-plant-36409796.html):

* Hollyhill is **Apple's only self-operated manufacturing facility in the world.** Specifically, it builds iMacs to order. Maybe your iPhones won't say ""Made in Ireland"" but your iMacs do. And plenty of stuff is designed in Ireland, they hire hundreds of engineers in Ireland.

* Cork is a **global transport logistics hub** for Apple. When a new iPhone is launched, Cork's managers become responsible for overseeing thousands of delivery trucks, flights and other practical arrangements to make sure the devices get to shops and depots.

* Apple organises the supply of products to **more than 147 countries** through Cork

3248,"Yes. The infamous “Double Irish” loophole existed since the 1980s and was phased out over a number of years beginning in 2014 and ending this past January. It’s gone.

Another loophole known as the “Single Malt” (due to exploiting a loophole in the Ireland-Malta tax treaty) was also closed in 2019.

Sinn Féin (you probably know them better as the party formerly associated with the now-defunct Provisional IRA) also proposes closing the remaining CAIA loophole and got a major share of the votes in the recent election at the start of the year. However Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil entered into coalition together and excluded Sinn Féin from government due (ostensibly) to not wanting to hand power to a party that is accused of still being a PIRA club.

So it’s complicated and CAIA seems like it’s not going anywhere until next election, but a growing number of Irish voters are inclined to get rid of it.

Speaking anecdotally, I don’t know a single Irish person who approves the Irish government’s tax shenanigans, and the Apple case is considered a source of national disgrace. The national discourse has been that while most Irish people want Ireland to stop being a tax haven, there’s a concern that we’d lose all the MNCs who would promptly move to wherever the next best tax haven is. Being heavily dependant on FDI, Ireland is cautious about alienating it, as the loss could be catastrophic.

However Sinn Féin’s recent electoral performance suggests that voters are starting to get impatient waiting for change, and there’s an expectation that they will do even better next election, at which point it will be virtually impossible for a government to exclude them from coalition.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/hqe4gj/the_tax_havens_attracting_the_most_foreign_profits/fxyh4d6/,ibFlare,1594666764

I am very well aware that Eastern Orthodox Christianity comes the Eastern Roman Empire, thank you very much. I use the example of Romania and Russia not to point out that Romania historically follows in Russia’s footsteps, but demonstrating that applying your logic to your home country (I felt it would be a clearer example for you than using examples from Thai and Japanese history) produces an absurd result. Your bafflement with such a comparison demonstrates my point, not yours. If you find saying that Romania follows Russia in its footsteps, then you must find saying Hungary follows in Russia’s statement as much, if not even more ridiculous. 

Becoming a Soviet Republic a few years after a communist revolution occurred is not ""following Russia's example"", so much as being inspired by the Bolshevik revolution that ""the time for the revolution is afoot. Workers of the world unite!"". That is not a pattern of following Russia but following the revolution. It is true that the Soviet Union was essentially the Russian Empire gone red, but that is something the communist around the world back then, and still many to this day do not accept.

   
 

The Romanians and Russians not liking each other is not a sign of a lack of similarities in and of itself, evident through modern Russo-Ukrainian tensions, but that is a whole other topic. Conflict doesn't mean a lack of influence, but yes, out of all the Balkan nations, Romania is relatively low on the scale of Russian cultural and social influence (compared to Bulgaria or Serbia for instance). I just state this to point out that tensions are not a sign in and of themselves of a lack of similarity (not arguing that Romania and Russia are two peas in a pod, but just commenting that your statement on bilateral relations is not proof of that).

   
 

In short, your point on the 1919 Hungarian communist phase does not demonstrate how Hungary as a nation in particular follows Russia. What occurred in 1919 is more just post-1917 Communist revolutions, in Europe no less. Maurice Thorez of France was quite the Stalinist too, but you cannot say that even late 40's to early 50's France followed in Russia's footsteps, much less the French nation throughout history.

Same with Economic Conservatism being more to the left than Reactionary Capitalism (far right).

And yet neither of these could be considered ""more socialist"" than the other.

""More the the left/right"" or ""closer to Socialism/Capitalism/other ideology""... : I guess, sure.

Trzaskowski appears to be around the liberal zone. (Economically and socially).

The whole jist of that is that the Polish left couldn't care less for the working class and their social values and economic needs, which looking at some of these comments and past behavior/actions seems accurate.
 
The left can only potentially get away with behavior like that in nations like America (though it still harms them) where the right couldn't care less about the working class and just acts as a front for corporations and the 1%. But in a nation like Poland where the conservatives take care of their people (and are economically left wing) and represent their values, this tactic will only blow up in their faces, so good thing the left keeps doing it.

Oh and one last note, it's a quite likely possibly that we could face a global economic depression/prolonged downturn due to everything that is going on. If that is true and also affects Poland then there will be even more working class people and people in need of help and wanting to turn to their traditional values. More ""stupid lowly peasants"" who will vote Pis. While in a Nation like America where the right is so neoliberal the left could surge in a depression, in Poland where the right is economically left wing and the 'left' is neoliberal and pro 1% it would have the opposite result. So the left in Poland if they ever want to be relevant has to know how to relate to the working class and represent their values instead of insulting them and drop their neoliberal schtick and support the working class economically with social assistance.

What the comment is implying is that multiple groups are at risk of racism, not just black people or POC. I think that's an important point to make, especially considering current political climate.

3454,"&gt;  there were areas with similar populations as this area

&gt; By your logic

That is not the logic being applied here (not by me nor by the OSCE). I don't know why you entirely omitted the fact that Nagorno Karabakh has been an autonomous entity with self-rule under the USSR **since 1923**, same year as the foundation of Turkey. If you look up the reasons why self determination is applied in the OSCE settlement process, this is one of the reasons.

The last census taken prior to the conflict in 1989 shows that 76.9% were Armenians and 21.5% Azerbaijanis. You can imagine how the referendum vote went (was boycotted by the Azeris). 

So what is it that you are claiming is being ignored here?

The vast majority of Azerbaijani IDPs are from the *surrounding territories* **around** Nagorno Karabakh. The settlement process includes the non-conditional provision for these surrounding territories to be given back to Azerbaijan where they could all return to their homes. Same applies to all the refugees.

The TRNC status not only is not analogous but obviously is not the status the Armenian side has been seeking, nor is it its ultimate goal. But that self-determination is applied to Nagorno Karabakh least to the level of Kosovo which would be applying the correct analogy. Again, remember, Armenian self rule since 1923 at the very least under the Soviets, and this is without going back further into history which goes beyond the context of the modern conflict.

The OSCE settlement:

&gt; The Basic Principles reflect a reasonable compromise based on the Helsinki Final Act principles of Non-Use of Force, Territorial Integrity, and the Equal Rights and Self-Determination of Peoples.

&gt; The Basic Principles call for inter alia:

&gt;- return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control;

&gt;- an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;

&gt;- a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;

&gt;- future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;

&gt;- the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence; and

3516,"&gt;No member state in the history of the EU has ever gone as far in subjugating its courts to executive control as the current Polish government. The Polish case has become a test whether it is possible to create a Soviet-style justice system in an EU member state; a system where the control of courts, prosecutors and judges lies with the executive and a single party.

Across Europe, national courts recognise the judgements of courts in other member states, whether these involve commercial law, the European arrest warrant or child custody. Judges must assume that courts across the EU operate according to common values and principles set out in the European Union Treaty and in its Charter of Fundamental Rights. Once judges across the EU have reason to doubt whether courts in any member state provide effective judicial protection, the legal order on which the EU rests collapses.


Someone in here with intimate knowledge of Lisbon Treaty safeguards etc.?

How can Poland and Hungary still be members of the EU after what happened in the last few months?

&amp;#x200B;

In case you forgot, our government had Goldman Sachs doing this for us.

Remind me again what action did EU take to punish Goldman Sachs for its role in that scheme?

Don't think too hard now, the answer is nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh but yeah, I forgot, they did appoint the Greek Central Banker of that time to VP of ECB!

Papademos who was the Governor of the Bank of Greece from 1984 to 2002, became the Vice President of the European Central Bank to 2010.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, the Eurostat as early as 2002, refused to validate greek figures, breaking protocol, because of course these were fake.

So in 2001, we join the Eurozone, using fake figures with the aid of Goldman Sachs, and in 2002 Eurostat blatantly refused to validate them, twice in March and September.

Do you know what this means? It means they knew right from the start.

Do you know what they did about that? Don't think too hard again the answer is still nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Except of course, like I mentioned before, they took Papademos, the governor of the Bank of Greece, (you know, the guy who did the dirty work with Goldman Sachs?) and appointed him to VP of ECB!

Heeeeeh, I wonder why they did that, huh? I mean the guy was a proven, certified crook, and they made him the VP of EU's top bank?

&amp;#x200B;

But wait, it gets better! Cause after 6 full years of knowing this whole thing but having done absolutely nothing about it, the financial crisis of 2008 starts with the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank which, after European banks got exposed to it, lead to the European debt crisis, not just ours (we were just the G of the.. PIGS) but since we were the first to go, EU so suddenly remembered with shock and terror that we have scammed our way to the Eurozone and turned it into a media sensation as if they just discovered something new!

And when that lead to a government crisis in Greece, and Prime Minister Papandreou was boo'ed away, who does EU had their stooges here appoint as our Prime Minister (caretaker... or so they said)?

Now if you answered Papademos, the Governor of the Bank of Greece who worked with Goldman Sachs to cook the accounts and rewarded by becoming VP of ECB... then your answer is correct!

With the blessings of EU, Papademos, this wolf of Goldman Sachs, became our new PM in 2011, a year after the crisis which had resulted from his actions, had started.

Now who is scamming who here?

3609,"I mean, the presidential elections that didn't happen in May were an organizational clusterfuck, but let's not demonize things, this is exactly the same populism that's the cause of everything wrong in this country, just in reverse direction.

Normal elections were scheduled for early May, when pandemic was still at height. They should have been postponed somehow, everyone knew that. There was a lot of political struggling, a lot of people changing their opinion as to what should be done depending on what PiS currently says should be done (proponents supporting every PiS decision, opponents criticising every decision, regardless of previous stance on that decision). In the end we didn't do that election at that date, which is good. In the end it was just postponed for a month, which is good and in line with the balance of health and safety vs the need to do an election. As far as end results go I don't see how that particular clusterfuck could have ended any better.

And for the election that happened just now - saying that existance of privileged groups (that we don't want to stand in queues for too long due to COVID being especially risky for them) somehow restricts who can vote is absurd. Electoral commission is always controlled by ruling party, and that control has not amounted to anything in every election we had so far, this one is not an exception - we have plenty of mechanisms to control election fairness in place, they were not teared down.

And that's why they are winning everywhere. They just give everybody money just to vote on them. Sadly Poles don't give a fuck that they are changing they country into dictatorship. Current president is accepting all these changes. They have already destroyed separation of power and changed the national television into propaganda machine. Right now that propaganda is so ridiculous that they asked Trzaskowski on a debate why he wasn't at the parade to honour the Battle of Warsaw and instead he was at the shop buying a jam. They even used word ""elite"" as negative word. That shit is really fucked up and I'm really sad that Duda has won. He is hated among the young people and beloved among the old.

Not to mention that Trump is pro Russian to some extend and doesn't care much for helping allies, stating multiple times that he'd hesitate to help out/assist with troops if say Estonia got invaded by Russia.

As for Biden, I was team Warren and then voted for Bernie, so he wasn’t my pick at all, but the hard swing to the left was more referring to what I expect to come out of his administration rather than his own personal beliefs. I don’t agree with him a lot but he does seem like a genuine person and has been meeting a lot with the progressive wing and letting them influence his platform. Bernie himself said if Biden gets elected and manages to pass most of his platform that he would be the most progressive President we’ve had, which is true. Having an ideological true believer in office would be great but at the end of the day what really matters is the laws that get passed and the policies enacted. If we actually get universal healthcare, better financial market regulations, criminal justice reform, and some real action on climate change it would be a pretty big deal.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/15/politics/supreme-court-lgbtq-employment-case/index.html

Conservative justices are simply better and understand law and how judges are supposed to act far better than so called ""progressive judges""

Trumps two supreme court picks last year found themself on the opposite side of cases more times than any two picks from the same president. 

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/28/trumps-two-supreme-court-justices-kavanaugh-and-gorsuch-diverge.html

Meanwhile progressive judges rule in lockstep with each other year after year and very often against the actual text of the law in favor of their political agenda. They are activists. Not judges

https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/09/10/liberal-supreme-court-justices-vote-in-lockstep-not-the-conservative-justices-column/2028450001/

For instance. Simply saying that the court ""greenlighted funding for a wall"" doesn't actually indicate anything about the preferences of those judges. They rule based on what the law says on that matter and nothing else. That's why simply saying that these cases here resulted in something I don't like, doesn't mean that the judges are not doing their jobs. They are not lawmakers.

As for doing a better job, I have former students who are senior software engineers for the company on whose phone I am typing this message. I have former students who are doctors, lawyers, nurses, and teachers too. I have kids at (and who have graduated from) Stanford, Oxford, Harvard, Duke, Berkeley, UCLA, and USC to name a few. I taught them well, and I can school you in a number of ways too.

Americans revel in their stupidity. I my opinion, many in our country ride the coattails of our grandparents and use their contributions in WW2 to act like America is the best country and perfect in every way. Very few of those people have traveled outside of our great (but struggling country) to see that the rest of the world has better ways of doing things. I’m new to reddit, but I think I saw that you were from Finland. From what I’ve read, their education system fantastic. While I teach high school, I’m not particularly fond of how our system is structured. But the fact remains, that regardless of the educational system, and even with the most qualified or inspirational teachers or compelling circumstances (not contracting or spreading a potentially lethal virus for example) the student is ultimately responsible for his or her success.

Americans have been given the all information necessary to prove that wearing masks (while inconvenient) is needed to stop the rapid spread of COVID.  We choose not to. Hence the sign on which I commented.

4470,"&gt; Why the fuck would you need 5 MWh for every 1 MWh?!

Because with variable energy you don't get the MWh when you need it. This is why you need massive overproduction as seen in this study by [Jenkins et al](https://www.innovationreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/EIRP-Deep-Decarb-Lit-Review-Jenkins-Thernstrom-March-2017.pdf). Your DIW study also has this, remember? They advocate for 5x the renewable capacity to power the german grid(300GW) vs only 60GW needed for nuclear. 

This is because the variable electricity consumption is not constant, or predictable to the teeth(meaning avg through the year it checks out, but not when looking at individiual weeks/months, which mean you need massive overcapacity to compensate).

Due to the variability of wind and solar energy, power
systems with high shares of these resources have much
greater overall installed capacity than more diversified
power systems, and must maintain significant dispatchable capacity to ensure demand can be met at all times.
For example:


● Pleßmann and Blechinger (2017) present
a scenario for decarbonizing the European
power system by 2050 (achieving 98.4% below
1990 emissions levels) that relies heavily on
an expansion of wind and solar energy. Total
installed capacity in this scenario is **4.2-times**
larger than the peak demand.


● Similarly, a 100% renewable electricity scenario
for Australia outlined by Elliston, MacGill,
and Diesendorf (2014) features total capacity
roughly **three times** the peak demand in the
system.


● Brick and Thernstrom (2016) likewise conclude
that total installed capacity is **3.5 to 5.5 times**
larger for wind and solar-dominated power
systems than more balanced systems.


plus many more if you read the study. 1MWh of dispatchable, flexible electricty is not the same as 1MWh of variable energy, hence the need of massive overcapacity.",,/r/europe/comments/hny4wp/european_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions/fxurymv/,dyyret,1594580338

The way you phrase it pretty much confirms my suspicion that you are not a turk. Good to know.

&gt;Turkey-Syria relations were good after Hafez died. Erdogan and Assad were like brothers. Then Erdogan decided to betray this and supported Jihadish rebels which eventually lead to a power vacuum in Syria that Kurds took advantage of.

4531,"&gt;This is a question you should direct to the US banks, not me.

Since you don't get it otherwise, let's make an example. A US company is building a nuclear reactor in texas. So why the fuck do they have to go to an American bank for a loan, when they can also go to the Deutsche Bank or whatever European bank, when they give far better interest rates?!

&gt; Where did I say you needed 1mw of storage for every 1mw of production? 

 ""Suddenly you have wind(30$) + storage(at least 150$) vs nuclear at 58$. Which is cheaper now?"" This calculation makes ONLY sense with this stupid assumption.

&gt; The 6% curtailment is if hydrogen is used as storage, instead of pumped  hydro/li-ion. Otherwise the curtailment rates are 22% and not 6% 

No, that's wrong. You probably can't speak german, so you don't know better, and I failed to adress this point. However, the study says, only 6% needs to be thrown away, instead of 22%, if we have 22 GW p2x capacity.

&gt; You cannot assume 1:1 LCOE ratio with increased renewable penetration. 

Of course I can? Why would the kWh be any more expensive with more renewables?!

&gt;  As seen [here](https://www.neon-energie.de/Ueckerdt-Hirth-Luderer-Edenhofer-2013-System-LCOE-Costs-Renewables.pdf) page 72, wind LCOE effectivley doubles once it reaches about 50% of grid penetration.  

That's because the guy is including system integration costs into the LCOE, which was the whole point of my back of the envelope calculation. 

&gt; Your wind LCOE of 30$ is now suddenly 60$ with high VRE shares. 

Again, it's not! I just have to make additional precautions due to the higher variability in the grid. But that's not part of the LCOE!

&gt; At that point it doesn't matter if the LCOE of 1MWh wind is cheaper than 1MWh of nuclear, if you need 5x the capacity. 

LCOE takes this already into account! The same capacity for wind and solar is FAR cheaper! But it then gets multiplied by the utilization factor.

&gt; We could do the exact same with nuclear. 40 EPRs would cover 500TWh  worth of electricity. 40 EPR will cost 500 billion euros if we assume  all of them face the same issues as flamanville 3(12.5bn$) 

No, so let me make the calculation for you. Flamanville 3 current [estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamanville_Nuclear_Power_Plant) is 19 Billion for 1600MW. A year has 365 times 24 hours = 8760h. With a capacitiy factor of 70.55% (which is [apparently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamanville_Nuclear_Power_Plant) typical for Flamanville), this makes 9.889 TWh per year (8760\*70.55%\*1600). So, for 500 TWh we need 50 Flamanville 3. Which is 50 times 19 = 960 Billion.

But I get your point. The estimate per MWh is too low. I must have went somewhere wrong in both back of the envelope calculations.",Bavaria (Germany),/r/europe/comments/hny4wp/european_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions/fxudxsf/,bene20080,1594573074

4587,"Well, it just depends on the conclusions people draw from this and how they respond. As mentioned, there are people of that demographic who awknowledge and condemn the things that people disproportionately in their community do. Its the case in basically any of these broad demographics that, even if the crime itself is disproportionately represented by that demographic, its only a very small minority of them that commit the violent crime, because ultimately most people are good and just want to get on with their lives. If the response ends up being to subjugate swaths of people who happen to fall in the demographic into oppression, things will only get worse and only add a layer of resenrfulness.
This isn't to ever excuse wrong doing, but to avert this, a route that appreciates the fostering of humanity in people can prevent criminal behavior from being seen as an adaptive strategy to feel like you have power and control. 
I'd reccomend reading on the Glasgow model, a city formerly declared the murder capital of Europe by WHO.

4609,"&gt; The US never had that. Except for the time they did... what? How is that even an argument.

My point is your racial/ethnic wars were far worse. That's a fact. Our Civil War was indeed over slavery, and it (along with the Jim Crow laws) opened people's eyes to the reality of race relations in the country. What equivalent does Europe have?

&gt;because Republicans became the racist party. So that is why people vote along racial lines

But I pointed out two minority groups that don't vote among racial lines to the same extent African Americans do. Why don't Hispanics and Asians vote 90%+ Democrat as well?

And whites don't vote among racial lines either. Really, it's only African Americans that swing overwhelmingly one way or the other.

&gt;Well, it is exactly. Since 40% approve of him.

He's about 1.3% off of his worst approval ratings from back in 2017. That is atrocious. And it's even worse, because incumbent presidents are so supposed to be at an advantage.

&gt;So you admit it happens. But somehow it is only bad when it happens in Europe.

Because the response is objectively different. It's tolerated in Europe, but not here. People get cancelled for less in America.

&gt;I know Americans see their constitution as some kind of religious thing (you even write it with a capital letter), but it really is not that special anymore.

We literally have the oldest constitution in the world, 232 years and counting, so clearly the Founders did something right. If ours isn't special, then no constitution anywhere is special. If nothing else, ours is more special than others. Call it propaganda if you want, I do not care.

&gt;The whole of the EU can go a year with barely killing anyone.

1. You have less crime.

2. Your police are better trained at deescalation. Our cops are chosen specifically to be meatheads.

I pointed out that more whites are killed by cops. Is it still a race issue?

&gt;Your line is the US is somehow more advanced on this compared to Europe

On race issues and integration? Absolutely. I've seen how you guys talk about Gypsies, Turks, and Arabs. Yikes. At least you're shamed over here for being openly racist.

&gt;The US has its shit together when it comes to propaganda. I mean, you got dozens of school shootings a year, police brutality with hundreds of killings without anyone even getting convicted for it, you got people going bankrupt or even die over a lack of healthcare, you got the most incompetent President in modern history. I can go on and on. If that is having your shit together, I rather won't have it together.

I'm against all of these things too, and I didn't vote for Trump. But we're talking about race issues, remember? I'll give you gun violence, our pathetic health care system, our incompetent police, the school shootings, etc. I will not give you race, that is where I draw the line.

&gt; Russia reported almost no cases in April.

In reality, Russia reported over 100.000 confirmed cases in April with officials [suggesting](https://www.znak.com/2020-05-02/sobyanin_zayavil_chto_koronavirusom_realno_boleet_2_moskvichey) that the number is significantly higher.

&gt; From the May 13 NYT article:

&gt;  significant underreporting by the authorities.

There are several official death counts in Russia with different methodologies:

* [The operative HQ](https://xn--80aesfpebagmfblc0a.xn--p1ai/) only counts deaths with Coronavirus as the main cause.

* [The Statistics Service](https://ria.ru/20200710/1574183840.html) additionally includes other categories (cancer, heart diseases, etc) affected by Coronavirus.

In the case of the operative HQ, excess deaths are indeed 25-30% [higher](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-53073046).

Here's an interesting snippet from the article:

Of the interesting reversals undertaken by President Erdogan since he came into power was to begin the return of Awqaf of the non-Muslim communities of Turkey. Churches and synagogues have been refurbished for use by these minority communities over the preceding decade, representing the largest such attempt by the Turkish government in the history of the Republic.

4724,"I hope I don't get downvoted for this, this is why I'm anti-EU.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Freedom of movement not only makes it easier for illegal immigrants to cross all over Europe, but it also allows people from poorer nations to live and work in wealthier nations, working for lower wages, which drives down the wages of the native worker, then they send said money back to their home country instead of allowing it to cycle in the native economy, this is why in my opinion freedom of movement can only truly succeed between countries on an equal level of wealth and quality of life, also a reason I support CANZUK more than the EU.
2. I have no interest in becoming part of a European superstate that seeks to rival the USA and China, I think European countries can work together and band together against common enemies without the need of political union, and if you don't think the EU wants to become a full political union, you haven't been paying attention. 
3. Indirect democracy. The EU is a complicated web in the way it works, but the fact is, it is not as democratic as it should be or could be, we vote for MEP's who then elect the leaders of the EU, it's like having MP's decide the new party in power.
4. And yes, the often ridiculed argument on this subreddit, of sovereignty, it is a fact that a nation within the EU is not sovereign, I do not want Italy, Germany, and France to tell my nation what it can and cannot do and I see no reason why my nation should tell other countries what they can and cannot do too, if you want that, that's fine, but in my opinion, the elected politicians of the United Kingdom should have the power to decide, what laws they want to enforce, what immigration policies they want to enforce, which countries they want to trade with, etc.
5. It is undeniable that the EU is dominated by Germany, and to a lesser extent France, in the years before the Brexit referendum the UK became increasingly sidelined by the aforementioned countries, that's not what I would want in a political union.
6. Finally, I do not feel enough similarities or kinship with other European countries to become a member of a political union, why should I feel more kinship with a Czeck over a Kiwi?

Yes. NK is effectively a monarchy, which is inherently incompatible with any socialist ideology (Monarcho-Socialism is as socialist as Ancap is anarchist). 

China's economy consists of private businesses, quite a lot of which produce in sweatshops, and has severely reduced its welfare efforts since the 80s. Deng Xiaoping was a capitalist roader and was removed from power and exiled multiple times during Mao's leadership for his right-wing positions. His successors, including Xi Jingping, followed in his footsteps and kept the socialist aesthetics while removing all traces of actual socialist policy in China. It is nothing but a bourgeois dictatorship now, which I believe is the fate of all vanguardist approaches to socialism. 

Lenin and his ideological descendants, including Mao, were fundamentally wrong about the role of the party during the dictatorship of the proletariat: In a unitary party system, the party leadership will eventually become a new ruling class that refuses to reliquish power and stands in the way of communism.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/hpr9e1/north_korea_says_uk_will_be_made_to_pay_the_price/fxtq4ob/,SeizeAllToothbrushes,1594559165

4771,"Just like Easter Island (in which the Moai were moved up to 10 miles), The early Brits cut down all their trees. First to build woodhenges, then to move the famous bluestones of Stonehenge the ~200 miles needed from the quarry outcrop of Carn Goedog, on the north slope of the Preseli Hills in south-west Wales.

Rolling them on one tree per foot, 5000 trees a mile, took them about one million trees. They then burned the few remaining trees left in Britain in a great worship of fire to their ancestors and deities. To the descendants of those who built it, Stonehenge was more than just a monumental erection. It was the immortal stone branches of an ancient family tree, and that one tree was enough.

After that was complete the Druids all jumped an iceberg to Canada before the Romans could conquer them. The Vikings then tried to conquer them in Canada but the Druids beat them back and used their Polynesian allies to kick them out of Greenland.

* ""Arizona"" is a proposed coalition of the conservative Flemish-nationalists [N-VA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Flemish_Alliance), the liberal parties [Open Vld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Vlaamse_Liberalen_en_Democraten) and [MR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouvement_R%C3%A9formateur), the Christian democratic parties [CD&amp;V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christen-Democratisch_en_Vlaams) and [cdH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_d%C3%A9mocrate_humaniste) and the Flemish social democrats [sp.a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialistische_Partij_Anders), and is named so because the coalition's political colours are represented on the [flag of Arizona](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Flag_of_Arizona.svg/1280px-Flag_of_Arizona.svg.png).
* This week first negotiations were supposed to start but sp.a and cdH didn't come because they don't trust the whole thing enough. It should be noted that N-VA, Open Vld, MR and CD&amp;V is the composition of the previous centre-right coalition, which lost its majority in the [2019 elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Belgian_federal_election). The more left leaning cdH and sp.a don't want to be seen as just propping up a failed rightwing coalition. They'd also be the smallest parties in the coalition and sp.a had to abandon their larger Frenchspeaking sister party [PS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parti_Socialiste_\(Belgium\)) due to them not getting along with N-VA. So sp.a and cdH don't have a very strong negotiation position and thus want extra garantees to include some of their key policies before making the jump.

4810,"&gt;Turkish people you think you mention are not even 0.01 percent of the population. People who are like that are super anti Islamic due to the history of how Turks were converted to Islam in reality.  
&gt;  
&gt; In schools of course it is always sugar coated like in 751 AD  Arabs were fighting against Chinese and since Turks and Chinese were big adversaries Turks sided with Arabs and shortly after they figured Islam was so close Tengrism and they decided peacefully to become Muslims.  First of all Tengrism and Islam are not even remotely similar.  One is more similar to Pagan culture (has also lots of magic involved based on nature powers) whereas the other one is pure Semitic (and magic is acknowledged as real but super duper banned).  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course people don't study for more but just learn what they are told at schools and usually be an ignorant victim of state propaganda (just like in anywhere else).

4818,"In my part of England they seem to chop down trees in the name of restoring grasslands and meadows. part of it works as it has brought back threatened species of rare butterfly and moth and allowed many wildflower species to make a comeback, but I still feel it is quite unfortunate to lose some more woodland that was starting to become established, The grasslands existence are a completely managed thing that without having Konik grazing it, quickly turns to scrub with many shrubs and some trees.

I think we should be making every attempt at connecting pockets of remaining ancient woodland together with planting of native tree species, in some cases this would be at the expense of grassland, right now the methods feel quite disconnected and the result is a patchwork quilt of woodland reserves and grassland reserves.

I know there's big talk on creating a great northern forest and they started work there, but they only plan to plant 50 million trees by 2042.

And you can't say that economists didn't warn us about this.

It was every EU nation? Again, you dont really understand the power dynamics in the EU. Even Schauble admitted that if he was the finance minister of Greece, he would not accept the loan that Greece had to take.

What the hell. This is actually well known by everybody. Not some conspiracy theory. First link on google on the issue: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/29/where-did-the-greek-bailout-money-go. The fact you call this a conspiracy theory is quite revealing. 

I am not blaming every country. It was a hard time and mistakes were also made by Greece. But I am also accusing Germany and Netherlands of hypocrisy, which is something that you fail to accept.

Note that free-trade agreements don't necessarily mean economic integration to any level similar to what EU does. It is true that there are several free trade agreements in the World, but the point still stands. Countries need some assurances to accept further economic integration. The funding of developing nations was part of that assurance to combat the centralization of industry in one or two countries, and reduce economic disparities. Richer countries accepted this willingly.

4942,"It is very complicated to summarise it in a reddit post, but I will give it a try (bear in mind I am no journalist so I am quite sure this does not count as a quality news post). True power in Bulgaria is held by people who are not in government by any means or belong to foreign countries. The government in charge, instead of using their legitimate power to shun the foreign and local out-of-government influences, they serve those very same who are holding the state captive. One of those who are no longer officially involved in politics, is the former head of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (ДПС/DPS in Bulgarian) political party, Ahmed Dogan. It is a populist party claiming to defend minorities (mainly Turks and Roma) but they extort them and keep them under control, feeding on the threats they make of an eventual ""ethnical conflict"" as they put it (Bulgarian PM even gave as an example how such conflict in Bosnia started from a wedding, just to remind Bulgarians not to speak out and protest and to show ""who the big boss is""). This has been going on since the 90s (after the collapse of communism, which never really happened in Bulgaria). Meanwhile, they blatantly violate the law, the cases of those in charge doing so are countless, but the most recent one which gave the spark of the protests is the ownership of a large mansion on the seaside by the very same former head of DPS. It is suspicious how he acquired the land, as it used to be state owned, moreover, he has blocked the access of a beach nearby which even by the owner's (Dogan's) most probably falsified documents, isn't his ownership. Some of the oppositionist political party members decided to disembark on said beach (as land access is obstructed) which got them in physical conflict with the security (which isn't a private security company, but rather the very National Service for Protection). Scandals broke out why the National Service for Protection protects a guy who is no longer in politics, and moreover why are they forbidding the access of a public beach (according to the constitution, Bulgarian seaside cannot be private property and every citizen has a right of passage there) From there on, a rapid escalation emerged, as it has been a public secret that Ahmed Dogan is one of the obscure figures behind the power in Bulgaria for the past 30 years. He himself used to be a part of the Secret Police during communist era and was indirectly tied to the ""Revival Process"" (which is an inhumane communist programme for renaming Bulgarian citizens of Turkish origins with Bulgarian names, it was enforced with violence, more about it you can google it). He then proclaimed himself as a defender of those same minorities the communists oppressed while he was an agent of the communist secret police himself. In other words, a complete and utter scumbag that the sane part of Bulgarian citizens (no matter what their ethnic background is) wants gone or even dead. Of course, that is unconstitutional but he has to face the consequences of the law and in most people's hearts it is the mob they wish gets to him first. It is very difficult to translate the negative emotions (mainly disgust) associated with this man and many people wish not to go over the line of saying that they want him dead but if you want the raw truth, that is what is in their hearts.

5025,"&gt;You have such a narrow and specific reading of history that is crafted precisely to justify your viewpoints about disliking Hungarians, it is beyond belief.

I don't dislike Hungarians. It's only the magyarization defenders that I don't like. You have such a narrow and specific reading of history, that you consider any criticism of past crimes as an attack on Hungarians.

&gt;Jewish is an ethnicity yes, but does that mean that they are culturally different if since their childhood they have spoken Hungarian and been integrated into Hungarian society? If you think so, then you are literally thinking like Adolf Hitler.

It's hilarious to watch you accuse others of what Hungary did in the 1920s.

&gt;It is not anti-Semitism to say that ethnically Jewish people are part of the concept of the nation, it is anti semitism to say the opposite because you are otherizing them.

It is also antisemitism to deny Jews of their own ethnicity. It is antisemitism to erase them from the census.

&gt;Your logic in your very comment is inconsistent

No, it's the logic of the Hungarian government that was inconsistent. Hungary saw Jews as useful tools in order to pretend that the number of ethnic Hungarians was larger than it really was. After Trianon, there was no need for that anymore, so the Hungarian government was eager to declare Jews as a foreign element.  Both before and after, the Jews were only a puppet in Hungarian games. The depth of Hungarian antisemitism was staggering, and your attempts to excuse it are shameful. 

&gt;Tell me, what makes a Hungarian or a Slovak or a Romanian? It sure as hell ain't their ethnicity, it is the language they speak and the nation they identify with (usually dependent on their mother tongue).

Using your insane logic, Ireland is today populated by Englishmen, due to the sharp fall of Irish language speakers. Try telling that in Ireland, and you'd get punched in your dumb face. Ethnicity is NOT tied to language. The Irish consider themselves Irish and separate from Englishmen, even if their mother language is English. The same happened in Hungary. The Jews considered themselves Jews, even if they spoke Hungarian. Who are you to deny them their own self-identification? An antisemite. That's who are you.

&gt;Stop trying to justify your hateful rhetoric and deny complexities. You complain about Hungarian ultra-nationalists, when it is you who demonizes an entire nation of people

Stop trying to justify your hateful rhetoric and deny the Jews their right for self-identification. You only see them as useful tools to falsificate census numbers in favor of Hungarians.

&gt;Trianon was a tragedy that resulted in millions of deaths.

More Hungarian ultra-nationalist lies and irredentist propaganda. Those millions of lies were taken by Hungarian anti-semites, as they shipped their Jewish population, who no longer had any use for census purposes, into extermination camps.

&gt;Hell, the irredentist Hungarian government of Admiral Horthy didn't want to reverse Trianon to create Greater Hungary either. 

Yes, they did. They occupied Carpathian Ruthenia, even thought it was majority Rusyn, they also waged a short war against Slovakia, during which they occupied Slovak towns in Eastern Slovakia. Greater Hungary was always their target, that's why they kept flying Hungarian flags at two-thirds mast. Google this, if you don't believe me.

&gt;If Magyarization was wrong, surely the far more modern and recent (and sometimes even ongoing) persecution of Hungarians is wrong. But you do not want to acknowledge this because in your eyes, Hungarians are evil.

I don't deny that there were acts of revenge for Hungarian crimes. But I also find it curious how your only defense of Magyarization is more whattaboutism. Fact: Magyarization led to Trianon. Had the Hungarians treated their minorities as equals, there would never be Trianon. Thus, the fault for Trianon is on Hungarians themselves. But you'd prefer to pretend that you were an innocent victim. Denialism is evil, and to deny your own history just means you're perpetuating old crimes. Keep on calling the minorities evil for wanting to leave an oppressive Kingdom.

The protests are fake and almost all of them are paid. Why is that well:

We just got accepted into the eurozone waiting area,meaning that the date of switching to euro is set. A while ago we bought f16 fighters, meaning that we have been leaving the russian zone of influence steadily. However this influence still exists in the form of oligarchs, the Russians are trying to cut their losses here, they are trying to payphone off all the money they sunk in a place that wont be favourable for them. That's why they had the president, a russian affiliated person call the people on a rebellion against the government. The whole goal of this exercise is to establish a 9month long emergency cabinet by russian affiliated oligarchs so they can siphon the money out of here. This must not happen because if it does all the EU funding will stop since they dint want to personally feed the old communist privatization mafia. It has happened before, Remember Oresharski?

5138,"People try to feel good by closing their eyes to reality. You just want to believe this is the real situation, which is not. In Turkey most of the people approve the decision. And economy is much better compared to pre-Erdogan period. Don't you see many Turkish people in this platform, swearing muslims, crying for Hagia Sofia, solace each other with Greek people. They don't like Erdogan. So they say Turkey is in a bad situation to discredit Erdogan. In reality most of the Turks don't use social platforms like reddit.

Let's see the facts: There is 1 place of worship for every 461 non-muslims in Turkey (around 180 000 christian and 20 000 jewish), while this is 1 mosq for every 2000 muslims in Europe and US (Google it for numbers if you want). In many Europian countries almost all of the historical mosqs are destroyed or changed. For example Varna of Bulgaria once called ""city of minarets"" because there were too many mosqs and minarets. Today you cannot find any historical mosq there except 1 from late Ottoman era which is 20 times smaller than usual mosqs.

As a conclusion, most of the Turkish people support Erdogan. Most of the muslim population in the world support Erdogan. Economy is much better than past. You cannot even compare. So now, you can choose to believe what you want to be the truth, what Turkish people say in this platform, which are the minority in the population.

5210,"&gt; Aha. First of all, the ""lending of money"" you are talking about was the solution proposed by countries like the Netherlands and Germany because they didn't want to combat a crisis like any other normal countries (e.g. US and China) do, which is printing money.

Mate, printing money to save your economy has historically been a fucking terrible idea. It's literally only recently that it's working without hyper-inflation due to these mega-economies being so interlinked with the global economy.

The EU went with a tested and tried method, and it wasn't Netherlands &amp; Germany's idea ... it was every EU nations.

&gt;They came up with this money lending approach, where most of the money didnt even stop in Greece. It went straight to pay German banks to save them from their past bad investments. Somehow, the Dutch and German media were able to hide this fact from their population, by reading the comments here on reddit.

What the fuck are you on about?

[Look how much money was *received* by each country.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_debt_crisis#EU_emergency_measures) That's not money was raised, it's how much went into each nation.

Stop falling for some evil conspiracy bullshit. And stop blaming everything on 2 nations, you sound like you've been reading some propaganda bullshit from populist media publications.

Look at who loaned these nations money. It's not just Netherlands and Germany. Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Germany, France, UK.

Stop acting like everything is some evil conspiracy and everyone is out to destroy you.

&gt;Everyone benefits to an extent from free trade. But as you may have realised there are very few trade agreements in the World outside of the EU.

5225,"&gt; where the golden times of the Victorian era is celebrated by a popular TV series,

People like the Victorian era aesthetic and its styles in *Britain*, but I don't see any show that glorifies the Boer war or anything conducted overseas. Not to mention that the Victorian era is hardly ""celebrated"" across the board, Charles Dickens is one of our most renown writers and half of his books are about the poor living in misery, suffering, and deprivation during the Victorian era.

&gt; where in my small town there is a monument to the soldiers fallen in colonial wars

Yes I suppose there is that, but that's hardly unique to the UK. Mongolia has a giant monument in honour of Genghis Khan, France has monuments to Charlemagne, Spain has monuments to Conquistadores, etc. People like to honour their fighters.

&gt;where half of the street names in the city centre celebrate people who made their fortunes in slave trade...

I guarantee you the average bloke on the streets has no idea who those names refer to or the history behind them. For most people, the name of a street is as notable as the amount of times you blink in a minute or the number of clouds that are currently in the sky.


&gt;And, as if it was not enough, citizens of that UK feel entitled to lecture my part of the world about how badly they deal with their historical sins.

And stop with this Ukrainian version, every fucking historian agrees that UPA did genocide there while AK fought against Nazi. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_of_Poles_in_Volhynia_and_Eastern_Galicia Only Ukrainian version calls it ""tragedy"" not massacre and shows that as war where Polish army fought with Nazi versus Ukrainian army and Nazi. 

Legit, what the fuck? This is some tiananmen square or liberated by Soviet Union level of history revisionism. But yeah, that 8000 soldiers of UPA that died during fight are equal to 100k of Poles, (including children) that were killed when OUN decided they need ""clear land""

&gt;Historian [Per Anders Rudling] states that the goal of the OUN-UPA was not to exterminate all Poles, but rather to ethnically cleanse the region in order to attain an ethnically homogeneous state.

Yeah, keep whitewashing it. Like it's just an ethnic cleanse, not genocide, not a big deal.

&gt;The Volhynian massacres have all the traits of genocide listed in the 1948 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which defines genocide as an act ""committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.""

And ""stealing your land"" LMFAO by this slogan you just gave free pass for ethnic cleansing on whole exYugoslavia. Its not YOUR land, It's land of people who live there. And plot twist, Poles lived there since XII?

 So cut your bullshit right there. Polish people were there for over 700 years, that massacre was aimed into Polish civilian people and this is widely accepted as genocide, only Ukrainians deny that. 

Nothing like this happened from Polish army to Ukrainian civilan people on this scale, so don't even try with ""symetric"" bullshit. Fucking war criminal apologist",***** ***,/r/europe/comments/hp785b/11_july_1943_ukrainian_nationalists_of_upa/fxso6nv/,Mailov1,1594526076

5550,"I have nothing against countries working together to implement their policy/politics. The thing is that in this case, Spain, Italy, France, Germany make up more than 50% of EU population and as you mentioned 80% of EU GDP. They should have gotten their way because they had the proportional power. But instead countries like Estonia or whatever swayed the vote, although based on population or GDP their vote should not have held as much weight.

The whole system is just flawed. If the other countries manage to get a coalition of countries which makes up more than 50% of EU population, they should get their way. But now, an Estonian vote, a vote of 1.3 million people matters as much as the vote of 83million German people. That's just not fare. And then German people should not really have any interest to be part of the EU if they do not get fair representation.

Look at clean energy transition/corona virus fund. It was initially planned that countries could not get subsidies from this recovery fund to use them for natural gas. But then Eastern European countries, who widely use natural gas rebelled, and even though they are least clean energy using countries, natural gas subsidies are bad for stopping global warming, and proportionally the countries who want the recovery fund to give subsidies for natural gas make up a small portion of EU population or GDP, they still got their way because of the number of country votes they have and the whole recovery plan is again being debated.

And all of those are rather small municipalities, like a max 20k inhabitants. Even a bigger city like Vasa has only 22,8% of it's population listed as Swedish speaking, and Karleby 12,6%. Åbo is at whopping 5,4%.

No. Your mind works in mysterious ways...

&gt; Is your customs familiar with concept of smuggling?

Sure. That doesn't mean anything. Russians managed to smuggle poison to UK, I don't see why they wouldn't be able to smuggle it to Czech Republic.

&gt; So, killing crimeans to cause regional crysis isn't ridiculous, but provoking plane crush is ridiculous?

Of this particular plane - yes.

&gt; Good luck reading about NATO and CIA operations.

Why? Are you under impression I don't about their shady operations and attrocities? Do you think I am some kind of US cheerleader? I get regularly accused of being anti-american. Shills are annoying whoever they shill for. You aren't exception.

&gt; Iraqis were presented as genociders with weapons of mass destruction

Yeah, I know. You are missing my point entirely. Iraqis were ""other"" whose lives were of no concern to USA.

&gt; How many died in vietnamese war, remind me?

Hopefully you now understand why bringing up Vietnam is nonsensical.

&gt; So, as you see, they were killed even for less.

How is being killed for ideology deemed hostile less than killing to slightly harm image of already disliked adversary?

&gt; Or you have to reread (maybe even couple of times) what I wrote to understand.

No, I don't. It's you who misunderstands.

&gt; So, there is no pro-western agenda in Czech media and those which are operating from Czechia?

Pro-western agenda in Czech media is irrelevant. I would have to watch them and believe them unconditionally for your accusation to be true. Neither applies. And I find it quite ridiculous, that you, Russian shill, is accusing me of such thing.

&gt; You are unbiased and independent person?

It also failed because neither Albanians nor Serbians supported it.

5670,"&gt;Russia faked the radar data

Okay, mr. radar expert, can you explain to me why Ukrainian radars were off? Didn't Ukraine allow flights in war zone?

Why USA refused to provide it too? Aren't they worried about their NATO partner?

&gt;but you will say it’s fake

And you will believe anything antirussian without checking.

&gt;I didn’t do it with such ease, the international investigation team has been investigating for years.

That's also strange if case is obvious.

If it isn't - why do you make conclusions before hearing all sides arguments?

&gt;Also, nobody said Russian politicians/military wanted this to happen. The Dutch are convinced this was a mistake - but it doesn’t mean there is no Russian responsibility.

Do dutch think that civil planes shouldn't fly in zone of war conflict?

Do dutch think that sides that allowed this should also be responsible?

Do you personally think that this wouldn't have happened without coup and  civil war in eastern ukraine?

&gt;Is USA getting away with terrible geopolitical behavior for decades? Yes. Should the western would stand up to that more - sure.

Does it stand up?

No.

Instead ""western world"" is allying with them and helping do dirty tasks.

Let me explain - russian mentality doesn't accept hypocricy on which ""western world"" is founded. If you can bomb civilians and call it ""humanitarian operation"" or place bloody dictators like Pinochet and call it ""democracy"" - then you automatically lose credibility for playing moral compass.

Same those who help them hold responsibility. So start with yourself.

&gt;The truth what happened should come out

Unfortunately I don' t think this will happen because of competitive policies behind all sides. Maybe in 50-100 years is more or less realistic point of view.

&gt;Flying over warzone was a huge fuckup from the airlines and the air authorities. They thought they would be safe at 10km.

Why do you think that was fuckup?

Other planes and drones were downed, they knew it's unsafe - still let them there. Radars off also.

And you see absolutely nothing suspicious in that, that's what amazes me, you've taken their side already - ""it's fuckup"". What if it wasn't ""fuckup""?

And if it actually was - is it criminal neglect? What do dutch think? What do others?

Eventually the fortress was designated a museum, and at some point a small amphitheatre was built inside the walls for concerts.  The mosque was built a few years ago to emulate the original structure (although I don't know if it's in the correct place, or is an exact replica).  It does, however, spoil the concert venue (was this deliberate, or was it the only place where such a building could be constructed?

You misremembered numbers of minarets. There are six minarets around Sultan Ahmed Mosque. At the time, only mosque with six minarets was *al-Mascid al-Haram* (The Great Mosque of Mecca). After completion of Sultan Ahmed Mosque, an another minaret was added to the Mosque of Mecca.

&gt; you will be amazed by the difference in built quality and workmanship when you compare Sultan Ahmet with Hagia Sofia

Not really. There are no mosaics in Sultan Ahmed Mosque. Depiction in Islam was forbidden, thus calligraphy and ceramic became the most important decorative art forms (In fact, Istanbul has become the [capital of calligraphy](https://i1.wp.com/www.akademiktarihtr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10.jpg?resize=571%2C268&amp;ssl=1)). [This is a photo that shows the interior of Sultan Ahmed Mosque](https://static.karar.com/img/650x400/19-02/11/16-1549871816.jpg). You can see there are more than 20.000 hand-glazed ceramic tiles with floral motifs. There are also calligraphic panels around four gigantic piers that sustains the dome.

In terms of the quality of architecture, Hagia Sophia is a mountain like building with a gigantic dome. It's mesmerizing. When you enter Hagia Sophia, you feel like millions of people can live in that building. Sultan Ahmed Mosque is a smaller temple, but it's not beneath Hagia Sophia in terms of architectural mastery.

Because of deteriorating condition of Hagia Sophia, more than twenty buttresses had to be erected in order prevent the building from collapsing. Eastern Romans, Latin crusaders and Ottomans built those butresses. As [you can see](https://hagiasophiaturkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Four-buttresses-on-the-west-side-of-Hagia-Sophia-4.jpg), they don't [look great](https://hagiasophiaturkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Buttresses-of-Hagia-Sophia.jpg). In Sultan Ahmed Mosque, butresses are incorporated into the walls of the building. That creates a more elegant look.

But if you're an architecture-junkie like me, the most impressive building in Istanbul is probably Suleymaniye Mosque. That gigantic temple sits on freaking pols.

&gt; The damage done to Hagia Sofia last time it was converted to a mosque is irreparable and incomprehensible when you notice the fine mozaique and craftsmanship originally built into the church.

Yeah, what a shame. Funny thing is most of original mosaics were not covered with plaster before 17th century.

That church was started in 1996, during the height of the Kosovo-Serbia tensions. It was being built in the center of the capital city of a province which was majorly Muslim. Not only that, it was built in a university plot. 

Just think about this, during a time when Albanians werent even allowed in schools, Albanians were all out of jobs, and Albanian was forbidden in schools, Milosevic saw it fit to further humiliate the population by building a huge Orthodox church in the center of the capital city. How would you feel if your oppressors built a massive mosque in the middle of Belgrade, in a fucking university plot?

We have tons of Orthodox churches and Catholic churches all over Kosovo, and nobody cares. We’re not extremist people. Hell, there’s a big church in the center of Prishtina that was built after the war and nobody batted an eye. We dont care. 

But as for that particular church you mentioned, I hope it continues to be pissed on, or just completely destroyed, because its only purpose for existance was the humiliation of the Albanian people.

As for the street names, they were named as a thank you to those that helped us not get ethnically cleansed, not because we’re sucking up to anybody. Either way, youre clearly moving the goal posts, because your initial post was about how I PERSONALLY was sucking up to westerners, but then changed it to KOSOVO sucking up to westerners.

If you look at members of your own ethnicity who live in similarly bad conditions (money, education, housing, social standing, job prospects) you might find that they aren't less likely to steal your wallet.

And while being mad, don't forget that for systemic reasons that individual has had less chance to become a fully functioning member of society - because that society doesn't even recognize him/her. So instead of locking him up and throwing away the key there should be efforts towards rehabilitation. And effort should be taken that fewer members of his group are made outcasts.

5958,"&gt;Massive immigration waves tend to depress wages of local low-income workers and increase profits of corporations that benefit from depressed wages, increasing inequality.   

That's sounds logical on it's face value, but the *actual* impact of low-skilled migration isn't as straightforward as:""more workers = lower wages"" would make you think.   

An example:   

&gt;Using data from the Current Population Survey, this paper describes the effect of the Mariel Boatlift of 1980 on the Miami labor market. The Mariel immigrants increased the Miami labor force by 7%, and the percentage increase in labor supply to less-skilled occupations and industries was even greater because most of the immigrants were relatively unskilled. Nevertheless, the Mariel influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, even among Cubans who had immigrated earlier.

5981,"The problem is with you placing equal or comparable value on humans and mice. And excluding plant-based diet from the criticism.

So, to be consistent, you either (1) need to oppose your own existence, because it means deaths of hundreds-thousands of mice (that's plant-only diet estimate), or (2) recognize the reality of competition of species in both settings, agricultural or laboratory. 

In both cases human lives exist because some rodent lives are sacrificed. But you criticize only one with your ""nazi"" hyperbole. 

This is also self-serving hypocrisy, just the flavor is different. You are fine with animal sacrifice as necessary for your plant-based diet, but not fine with the same for the sake of saving other humans with medical research.",⚑ For the glory of Chaos ⚑,/r/europe/comments/hp50q6/monument_to_lab_mouse_in_novosibirsk_russia/fxnwxy0/,Idiocracy_Cometh,1594472783

They are geopolitical actions the EU is undertaking to try and weaken the US dominance in the tech sector. It is weaponised tax policy.
