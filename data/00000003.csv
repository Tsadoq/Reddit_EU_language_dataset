2,"That issue was two fold. Firstly our voting system (First Past the Post) is shit and none of the big parties have an incentive to change it because it keeps them at the top.

In 2019 the Tories got 43.6% of the popular vote but won an 80 seat majority.

More people in the UK voted for left leaning parties that may have negotiated a softer brexit.

The second issue is the fact that the main opposition party, Labour, were perceived by the electorate (rightly or wrongly) in both 2017 and 2019 to be ""sitting on the fence"" about Brexit. 

The fact is anyway you cut it the people wanting Brexit, if they are a majority of British people, were only a slight majority in 2016, and in the subsequent General Elections it is hard to tell if that majority has increased or decreased.",England and Malta,/r/europe/comments/p17i71/british_travellers_rage_as_vodafone_brings_back/h8dwvzl/,NewCrashingRobot,1628581477

So a part from a few alcoholics (one is too many, but still we're far from a huge population) and some gypsy weirdos, most people are farmers or just enjoying the country tomatoes and pork bacon, not subsistence farmers.

French farmers can afford a holiday in an actual hotel, probably abroad. Can your ""not subsistence farmers"" afford it? Can they afford a modern car with modern safety features?

We also used to have a lot of floods during the 90s, so for years our governments worked on directing as much as possible of that rainwater as quickly as possible to the sea. Which in itself is not bad, however with climate change we have more and longer (sometimes months at a time) dry spells and when it rains now it's gone too fast, meaning it cannot seap into the ground and our waterlevel keeps dropping.

Generally-speaking, I think that the gators involved aren't all that interested in going after the human.  I think that there's probably an implicit assumption in OP's poll that the gator and the human are both trying to kill each other, though.

Also, the question was about crocodiles.  It looks like the American crocodile -- which you guys also have -- can max out at about twice the weight of the American alligator, so they're probably pretty potentially big.  I also think that the crocodile is endangered, so while people may be okay with gator wrestling, I don't think that crocodile wrestling is a thing.

399,"It can be used in hunting, though, where the prey is rendered exhausted before being finished off.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting

&gt; Persistence hunting (sometimes called endurance hunting) is a hunting technique in which hunters, who may be slower than their prey over short distances, use a combination of running, walking, and tracking to pursue prey until it is fatigued or overheated. A persistence hunter must be able to run a long distance over an extended period of time. The strategy is used by a variety of canids such as African wild dogs, and by human hunter-gatherers.
&gt;
&gt;Humans are the only surviving primate species that practises persistence hunting. In addition to a capacity for endurance running, human hunters have comparatively little hair, which makes sweating an effective means of cooling the body.[1] Meanwhile, ungulates and other mammals may need to pant to cool down enough,[1] which also means that they must slow down if not remain still.[2]
&gt;
&gt;Persistence hunting is believed to have been one of the earliest hunting strategies used by humans.[2][3] It is still used effectively by the San people in the Kalahari Desert, and by the Rar√°muri people of Northwestern Mexico.",üá∫üá∏ üçî United States of America üçî üá∫üá∏,/r/europe/comments/p1888v/americans_are_more_confident_than_britons_that/h8d83x8/,duisThias,1628564435

That's a bad joke. Approximately zero Armenians wanted war in 1988. The entire Karabakh Movement was completely peaceful for years. The protests of hundreds of thousands of people in Yerevan, the petitions of the people of Karabakh to Armenia and Moscow, and finally even the plebiscite (vote) for independence from Azerbaijan were all peaceful. That was the Karabakh Movement.

Small ethnic tensions began in some regions of Armenia and Azerbaijan, but the big violence was in Azerbaijan where pogroms of Armenians in 1988 in Sumgait, 1991 in Baku, and in other cities at other times were capped by Operation Ring where the official Soviet and Azerbaijan troops to start the official and quite violent ethnic cleansing of Armenians in Karabakh. That is when the war really began, and Armenians never wanted it. Ever. They just wanted self-determination for a long list of reasons that has now grown much much longer. Once the war began, the gloves came off on both sides, and sure, it was ugly, but let's not pretend that Armenians wanted any violence. They tried for years to peacefully correct a really shitty border that the Soviets has imposed on them.

We're already kludging up the place with all kinds of additions that just happen to include steel girders and stabilizing brick structures, so I hope that the sheer volume of crap we're adding will provide some extra solidity.  

Also, a large part of the original construction process seems to have involved ""lol we 'found' some bricks/cement/rebar that, uh, fell off a truck"" so I guess it's not all bad news.

I once asked one of our builders what these walls are made of,  he literally just reached into a hole he'd made and grabbed a fistfull of mud and crap.  ""WTF THAT'S MY WALL PUT BACK MY WALL RIGHT NOW""

Nobody stops you from going towards EU. Plus I don't understand why are you so frustrated towards me. Calm down.

It's not my duty as Lithuanian to protect Russian people. It is Russian duty to protect Russian people. It is up to you and your people to stand up against Putin. Our parents already stood against brutal Soviet regime who literally skinned people alive here and run people over with tanks.

Or what about Countries being able to sell and buy eachothers pollution? 

""Emissions trading - Wikipedia"" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_trading


Yeah, let's not adress the problem directly. Wave the paper that says we decreased pollution by 10%, because you sold 20% of your pollution to a country with 0 emissions...

Carbon trading schemes have tended to reward the heaviest polluters with 'windfall profits' when they are granted enough carbon credits to match historic production. Expensive long-term structural changes will not be made if there are cheaper sources of carbon credits which are often available from less developed countries, where they may be generated by local polluters at the expense of local communities.[81]

They attacked the towns and spared neither the children nor the aged nor pregnant women nor women in childbed, not only stabbing them and dismembering them but cutting them to pieces as if dealing with sheep in the slaughter house. They laid bets as to who, with one stroke of the sword, could split a man in two or could cut off his head or spill out his entrails with a single stroke of the pike. They took infants from their mothers' breasts, snatching them by the legs and pitching them head first against the crags or snatched them by the arms and threw them into the rivers, roaring with laughter and saying as the babies fell into the water, ""Boil there, you offspring of the devil!"" Other infants they put to the sword along with their mothers and anyone else who happened to be nearby. They made some low wide gallows on which the hanged victim's feet almost touched the ground, stringing up their victims in lots of thirteen, in memory of Our Redeemer and His twelve Apostles, then set burning wood at their feet and thus burned them alive. To others they attached straw or wrapped their whole bodies in straw and set them afire. With still others, all those they wanted to capture alive, they cut off their hands and hung them round the victim's neck, saying, ""Go now, carry the message,"" meaning, Take the news to the Indians who have fled to the mountains. They usually dealt with the chieftains and nobles in the following way: they made a grid of rods which they placed on forked sticks, then lashed the victims to the grid and lighted a smoldering fire underneath, so that little by little, as those captives screamed in despair and torment, their souls would leave them...""

""While I was in the boat, I captured a very beautiful Carib woman, whom the said Lord Admiral gave to me. When I had taken her to my cabin she was naked (as was their custom). I was filled with a desire to take my pleasure with her and attempted to satisfy my desire. She was unwilling, and so treated me with her nails that I wished I had never begun. But (to cut a long story short) I then took a piece of rope and whipped her soundly, and she let forth such incredible screams that you would not have believed your ears. Eventually we came to such terms, I assure you, that you would have thought that she had been brought up in a school for whores.""

815,"&gt; A stylish 94-page brochure sets out a variety of means through which it is hoped that French performance can be improved... One of the most interesting sections of the new document compares high-performance programmes in other comparable countries - the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands.

&gt; The information compiled appears to show that available resources in the four larger countries, including France, are broadly comparable, at between ‚Ç¨104 million (¬£92.5 million/$120 million) and ‚Ç¨115 million (¬£102 million/$132 million) a year.

&gt; The equivalent figure in the Netherlands is put at ‚Ç¨53 million (¬£47 million/$61 million), but the Dutch economy is said to be one-third the size of the French.

&gt; ""It is interesting to note,‚Äù the document goes on, ""that the UK and the Netherlands ‚Äì with similar or smaller budgets ‚Äì have achieved the most spectacular progress in the Olympic medals table and the quantity of medals won at World Championships"".

&gt; These two countries, the report continues, ""decided to concentrate their financial resources the most on just a few federations, or just a few disciplines in the case of the Netherlands"".

&gt;It was granted in 2016 when the costume designer decided that the outfits would look good with the royal arms on them; but on being told that it's completely inappropriate to use the royal arms for something that isn't connected to the monarch, she instead petitioned the Collage of Arms for a unique Team GB coat, which was duly granted.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since ownership of coats of arms are a matter of legal property in the UK, there needed to be a company that owned the coat of arms; but the problem is that the Olympic team and the Paralympic team are actually managed by two completely separate entities with no overlap whatsoever for the arms to be granted to. So instead they had to jointly found a holding company that the arms could be granted to, which they called ""2016 Crest Holding ltd"", much to the Collage's chagrin.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, with a company now existing that the arms can be legally granted to, herald Clive Cheesman went off and designed the arms; taking great care in the symbolism to give equal representation to all 4 constituent nations, and dealing with the thorny issue of how to represent Northern Ireland in a way that doesn't piss off either Unionists or Republicans.  
&gt;  
&gt;With all that done, we now had a Coat of arms that can completely legally and legitimately be used by both the Olympic and Paralympic athletes; at which point the costume designer turned it into a silhouette to put on the uniforms in black and white, completely masking all of the symbolism that had been so carefully worked out and reducing it to a simple shield shape held up by some lions; presumably so it's less obvious that it isn't the royal coat of arms that they wanted to use in the first place.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;and... that's it. The arms have not been used for anything again since, and remain the unused property of '2016 Crest Holding ltd', presumably forgotten by both companies that it even exists and that they didn't in fact have the royal arms on their uniforms in 2016.",England,/r/europe/comments/p0zbi5/composite_image_of_team_gb_medallists_from_the/h8aqr9x/,Sahaal_17,1628524236

973,"The best converter according to many people is the austrian Rosenbauer: they have been in the game for very long and have come up with some revolutionary products such as the Rosenbauer AT, the Rosenbauer Panther and the brand new Rosenbauer RT. 
They also make great ladder trucks thanks to a collaboration with Metz, but when it comes to turntable ladders noone tops those who invented them: the Ulm-based Magirus. They have been in business since more than one century and they were one of the brands that together formed Iveco. Iveco then took control over the company wich is why before the current Magirus Lohr denomination the company was called Iveco Magirus and why many of their trucks were and still are based on Iveco chassis and also a reason why Italy is such a big market for them. 
But in Italy Magirus has a great rival: the Italian BAI (Brescia Antincendi International) has made some of the best and most iconic trucks of the Italian National Fire Brigade in the recent years and they are just the best when it comes to highly specialized trucks such as those used in the Mont Blanc tunnel or the Frejus tunnel, road-rail bimodal pumper trucks that they built for the Italian National Fire Brigade and other road-rail bimodal trucks built for a Chinese FD or the high capacity water tenders built for middle eastern countries. But they also have a great market in Germany, too, thanks to their separate branch.
German fire departments though, aside from Magirus and Rosenbauer, really trust two German based companies which had much success in other European countries too: Schlingmann and Ziegler, the latter is known, among other things, for its iconic ARFF truck. 
Then there are plenty of smaller companies which are specific for a country but sometimes export their products abroad such as the French Gimaex or the British Emergency One. 
Finally here in Italy we have some small, usually family-owned companies which make products for civil protection including vehicles, but rarely sell anything abroad: these are Aris, Divitec, PiemmeMatacena and the South-thyrolean Kofler which sells almost exclusively to fire departments in the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano,  where the Italian National Fire Department doesn't operate.

They attacked the towns and spared neither the children nor the aged nor pregnant women nor women in childbed, not only stabbing them and dismembering them but cutting them to pieces as if dealing with sheep in the slaughter house. They laid bets as to who, with one stroke of the sword, could split a man in two or could cut off his head or spill out his entrails with a single stroke of the pike. They took infants from their mothers' breasts, snatching them by the legs and pitching them head first against the crags or snatched them by the arms and threw them into the rivers, roaring with laughter and saying as the babies fell into the water, ""Boil there, you offspring of the devil!"" Other infants they put to the sword along with their mothers and anyone else who happened to be nearby. They made some low wide gallows on which the hanged victim's feet almost touched the ground, stringing up their victims in lots of thirteen, in memory of Our Redeemer and His twelve Apostles, then set burning wood at their feet and thus burned them alive. To others they attached straw or wrapped their whole bodies in straw and set them afire. With still others, all those they wanted to capture alive, they cut off their hands and hung them round the victim's neck, saying, ""Go now, carry the message,"" meaning, Take the news to the Indians who have fled to the mountains. They usually dealt with the chieftains and nobles in the following way: they made a grid of rods which they placed on forked sticks, then lashed the victims to the grid and lighted a smoldering fire underneath, so that little by little, as those captives screamed in despair and torment, their souls would leave them...""

""While I was in the boat, I captured a very beautiful Carib woman, whom the said Lord Admiral gave to me. When I had taken her to my cabin she was naked (as was their custom). I was filled with a desire to take my pleasure with her and attempted to satisfy my desire. She was unwilling, and so treated me with her nails that I wished I had never begun. But (to cut a long story short) I then took a piece of rope and whipped her soundly, and she let forth such incredible screams that you would not have believed your ears. Eventually we came to such terms, I assure you, that you would have thought that she had been brought up in a school for whores.""

1067,"I broke my arguments into two parts, teams and individuals. You missed that, perhaps I wasn't clear enough.
1. Team events. A country (one NOC) can only field one team. So can only win one medal per event. Thus EU would win less team medals than when multiple countries got multiple medals in the same event.
2. Individuals. Three athletes can compete per country per event, and all could win a medal. But to beat the medals of up to 3*27=81 competing athletes, you need to perfectly pick the three best on the day(s) they will compete. Because if you fielded dozens of EU27 athletes and one of the top athletes drops out for some unpredictable reason (injury in training or qualifying, or some family or stress MH issue) you still have your next best athlete  (perhaps in different coubtr) and they could still medal. With an EU1 team you don't have these ""backups"" if you are one country. So EU would win less individual medals.

It's just harder for one country to win as many medals and many countries, sporting capacity being equal.

To achieve the same medal haul with a combined EU1 NOC as they do with EU27 NOCs, they would need to diversify eg enter and win in events that they don't currently medal in.",,/r/europe/comments/p0egy7/introducing_the_new_olympics_superpower/h89ygke/,whats-a-bitcoin,1628510000

1078,"&gt;besides, the Greeks borrowed just as much from the neighbouring Minoans, Hittites and Egyptians as the rest of Europe did from the Greeks. 

That wasn't argued, doesn't change the fact that the Greeks brought that knowledge to the ""west"" but also evolved upon those ideas. 

&gt;Other than modern day democracies, I don't know how historically important Greece even was

Excuse me? 

Just some things that the Greeks invented are :

Columns , Stadiums, Theater, Human Sculpture, Algebra ,  Physiotherapy, Paleontology, Anthropology, Alchemy , Paleontology, Physiology, Epidemiology , Evidence based medicine, Alarm Clocks , Air and Water Pumps, Central Heating, Showers , Bathtubs, Automatic doors, Vending Machines,  Clock Towers,  Construction Cranes, Watermills, disability ramps, Elevators, Railways, Curtains , Spiral Stairs , the first ever artificial, self-propelled flying device, Literally the studies of climate (climatology) , musical instruments like the Lyre and the Guitar, multiple sports, the freaking Olympics which just happened , The first scale map of the known world, Headbands , Glasses ,  Hydrometers, Lighthouses , Political science, the first steam engine and steam powered devices...i could keep going. 

&gt; it was Rome that did most of the civilising

Rome was Greece 2.0 , the Romans practically held greek culture as the highest form of culture, so much so that their nobles were taught and spoke Greek. The Romans basically too most of their ideas from the Greeks, even down to their Pantheon (basically just took the Greek pantheon and changes their names). In a way Greece was to Rome what Egypt was to Greece. 

&gt;you didn't need many Greek ideas to be a medieval kingdom and Christianity, which historically had the largest influene on Europe, if not the world, wasn't even Greek. 

... 

I suggest you do some research regarding the impact Greece played in teaching ,spreading and establishing Christianity in the Western World. 


So much so that Orthodox Christians are a thing, this was a Greek specific brand of Christianity which is now spread across the world from Europe and Russia to African countries. Literally the most important christian church, basically the Christian Mecca was build by Greeks in Constantinopole (Hagia Sophia) ...like what are you even on about?

1103,"If you'd wanted to cripple Russia one should do it by taking advantages of its weak geography.  A united EU-army combined with he that of the US would have to take control of three key areas/fronts

* Kalingrad

This little exclave is a major threat to European safety. It's proximity to Belarus and strategically placement on the Baltic sea make it of major importance. The territory once conquered should be integrated in Poland, Lithuania or a divide of those countries. This should probably be one of the first targets as it can be taken swiftly since its already surrounded and if its not conquered it can be a real problem later on.

* St. Petersburg

This is one of the most important harbors of Russia, as well as a major economic center. Taking the city and its surroundings strips Russia of its coastline in the Baltic sea. It's gonna be hard to take it since it is core Russian territory. Its well defend (naval base) and its population is almost entirely Russian making it susceptible to resistance. However this is the most important target of the whole operation, and should be invested in heavily. Once its take the land could be divided between the Baltic states and Finland, or a Petersburgian buffer state could be formed. It would be hard to hold on to this land because its of major importance to Russia and the Baltic states and Finland would need significant military support  to withstand possible Russian recuperation.

* crimea all the way to georgia

This area is the biggest and maybe hardest to take. The black sea is basicly Russia's playground. Its the only place sea on earth the US navy doesn't have a presence. The land is divers and any move would be predictable. Turkish assistance would be necessary as crossing Istanbul would violate long standing treaties. Turkish cooperation would depend on ensuring them that this operation can be successful. Turkey already wants to get rid of the treaties as its costing them billions in revenue Bosphorus crossing. If succesful, This would cut Russia off from its permanent ice-free harbors, which is a huge deal for them.  
Crimea should be reintegrated into Ukrain, and Georgia's borders should be restored and perhaps expanded. The area between rostov and the caucasus could be integrated into Ukrain or a bufferstate could be created here.   
For it to be succesful a considerable amount of territory should be taken as to provide geographical defensibility. It would be wise to push all the way to the Caspian sea using the Wolga  and the Don as a defense in the north.

A fourth frontier might start on the other side of Russia. China has been eying up the Manchurian area for some time now. As China sees these people as their own. There are some strategic motivations as well, as they would get control over Vladiwodstok harbor as well as more control over the Japanese- / East- Sea. An American European war might just be the opportunity they'd take.

If this operation were to be successful Russia would be severely crippled. Being almost landlocked is major disadvantage for any nation. However the real challenge would start after that. Holding on to those territories that are populated in large by Russians could become problematic. Especially if the Russians use these people to start separatist movements. Russia has done this in the past. Relocating the Russians might be the only solution, however this is would cause international friction as it is widely seen as an unacceptable practice.

The highest shares of employed women with children were recorded by Slovenia (86.2%), Sweden (83.5%), Portugal (83.0%), Lithuania (82.6%), Denmark (82.2%), the Netherlands (80.7%) and Finland (80.3%). The lowest employment rates were reported by Italy (57.3%), Greece (61.3%) and Spain (66.2%) where less than two thirds of women with children were employed.  
  
Men with children were employed the most in Czechia (96.5%), Malta (95.7%), Slovenia (95.0%), Sweden (93.9%), the Netherlands (93.7%) and Poland (93.5%).  
  
Italy and Greece recorded the largest gender gaps with and without children, 28.9 pp and 12.6 pp in Italy and 27.2 pp and 11.8 pp in Greece. The lowest gender gaps for people with children were found in Lithuania (6.8 pp), Slovenia (8.8 pp) and Portugal (9.3 pp). For people without children, Portugal (0.1 pp), Belgium (0.8 pp) and Germany (1.0 pp) recorded the lowest employment gender gaps.

**More children linked to lower employment rate for women, especially for those with low education level**  
  
In 2020, the employment rates for women with none or up to two children were similar (around 74% on average), however the more children women had, the lower their employment rate. Women with three children or more had an average employment rate of 59.1%.  
  
The educational attainment level plays an additional important role in the female employment rate: the higher the number of children, the wider the employment gap between women with low and high level of education. This ranged from 32.0 pp for women having one child to 48.4 pp for women with three or more children.  
  
For men the picture is rather different: men without children were found to have the lowest average employment rate (80.9%), while the highest employment rate was found in men who had two children (92.4%), before dropping to 86.7% for men with three or more children.

1185,"**Data Sources**

The source for the case data and positive testing data is here: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

The source for the vaccine data is here: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations

I've had requests for the spreadsheet, so here is the newest one as of 19th July: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WqpGTxhWI-Nm3gK-xUthzq3ClZ8vl1Um/view?usp=sharing

I won't be keeping these versions up to date but you can see how the data is entered and calculated. 

**Version Notes**

The ecdc stopped updating data on a daily basis as of 14th December. I figured weekly data wasn't particularly useful and while the worldometer data is not as accurate as an official agency, at least it is daily so people can make informed decisions about it. 

Just so you can see the extend of the variances, here is the data for the 12th, 13th and 14th of December between worldometer and ecdc: https://imgur.com/Y71Nx7o

Some of this will be due to delays in data reporting and methodologies, others will be the source. In order to do a more detailed comparison, you need to look at the data sources on the ecdc and worldometer sites.

I've added vaccination data as of 23 March 2021. This data is sourced separately and is also not always fully up to date - as such, there's a column which includes the data date. Note that I will be reporting as per the data collected by ""Our World in Data"". 

I've started including serious case data as of 16th June 2021 as it is relevant to whether the vaccines are working.

**Schedule**

I will post this chart daily (where possible) during the week, Monday to Friday but I will not update it at weekends because around half of the countries do not update their numbers over the weekend and also it's on a computer I would not otherwise be logging onto, unless there's something particularly notable which requires a weekend update.

**Explaining some numbers**

*What is the 7 day case rate?* 

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it.

The 7 day case rate number in the graph is the number of people in that stadium who would have a coronavirus infection a week later. For example, in the UK on the 8th November the number was 239.7. That means 240 out of 100,000 people in the stadium would have an infection the following week.

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the daily movement*

The daily movement numbers are just how the 7 day case rate is moving up and down each day. The 7 day trend is the most interesting number - it's the sum of all the ups and downs. If you think of the infection as a car then the 7 day case rate is the speed of the coronavirus infection and the 7 day trend is the acceleration (or deceleration) of the infection. If the 7 day trend is red it's accelerating, if it's neither red nor green it's holding steady and if it's green it means it's slowing down (note - a green 7 day rate doesn't mean the infection is shrinking, just that it's slowing down).

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*How can I tell if the infection is shrinking*

You can't infer that from this data, this data only looks and new cases and the rate of change in new cases. The other side of the equation is how many people are recovering from coronavirus in each country. If you think of it like a bath - this is how much water is flowing through the taps. You cannot tell how much water is going down the plughole so you can't tell how much water is in the bath (i.e. the infection level).

*What is testing rate per 100,000?*

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it.

The testing rate is how many of those 100,000 people will have received a coronavirus test in a 7 day period. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the positive test rate*

This is the % of tests taken which are coming back positive. The WHO says countries should aim for this to be 3% or lower and that testing not keeping up with infections if the rate is above 10%. If you don't have enough tests, you restrict access to them to people who are more likely to be infected either by their symptoms or their risk of exposure, and that inflates your numbers.

This number is a ratio of tests completed, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 3% adjusted case rate*

Used to be the 10% rate but has been rebased around 3%. There is also a lower limit at 1% where the impact will be reduced by a factor of 5. 

Countries with a higher positivity rate are not testing enough of their population, so this multiplies their most recent day's case rate by a factor of their positivity rate divided by 3% - for example on 6th April Greece's positivity rate was 6% so their daily case rate was multiplied by 6%/3% = 2

**This is not** an estimate of the true scale of the pandemic within the country** but is a proxy to rank countries by accounting for countries who are showing a lower positive case rate because they're not doing enough testing.

This number accounts for population size AND level of testing within a country, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 7 Day Vaccines per 100,000?*

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it. This is the number of people in the stadium who would have received a vaccine dose of that stadium in a 7 day period. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 1st Dose %*

This is the % of a population who have received their first vaccine dose. It covers total population which includes children so will be lower than the number some sources cite (% of adult population)

*What is the 2nd Dose %*

This is the % of a population who have received all of their vaccine doses to be considered vaccinated (includes single dose vaccines like J&amp;J)

*What are serious cases?*

For most countries, these are the number of patients currently being treated for COVID in ICUs. The numbers are not a perfect comparison because some countries below the line (India, Brazil) don't have ICU capacity, so they look low, but in reality they're just not getting the right care to their serious cases. But for the purposes of comparing against Europe, it's a fair yardstick. 

*What are serious cases per million?*

This shows the number of people in the country currently counted as a serious case - most countries class a case as serious as being treated in ICU, but the definition may be changed by different countries. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is % of cases that are serious?*

This is the number of serious cases divided by the 7 day case rate which is a proxy for how many cases are progressing from infection to a serious case. This is not a perfect metric because serious cases may have originated earlier than the past 7 days, but it's a good enough proxy because every country is being calculated in the same way

This should reflect how well the vaccination efforts are going, because in an unvaccinated population with ICU capacity, this number should run broadly the same minus any drastic changes in population dynamics - older people are more likely to end up in ICU.

This number may be unusually high in countries with low populations (e.g.  Liechtenstein) or countries who are underreporting how many active infections they have (e.g. Romania).

*What is the comparable unvaccinated rate?*

This functions very similar to the 3% adjusted rate but for serious cases. I've gone back to pre-vaccine rates and looked at what the serious case rate on average was throughout December 2020, and it was around 3%. As such this normalizes the 3% adjusted rate to what it would be if the serious case rate were 3%.

For instance in the UK on 4th July there were 3.9 serious cases per million - without vaccines that would be the level you'd expect if the 3% adjusted case rate was 9.7 per 100,000 as opposed to the UK's actual rate of 256 cases per 100,000. This is indicative of a country that has a high vaccination rate where case rate is less important. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

**Why sort by the comparable unvaccinated rate?**

Look at Poland on 9th November as an example - their actual 7 day rate was not actually much higher than the UK's (200 vs 160) and is lower than Denmark's (221), but their positive test rate is 49% - basically 1 out of 2 tests came back positive compared to 5% for UK and 2% for Denmark. Poland only test a fraction of their population compared to the UK or Denmark (706  vs 3198 / 8658 per 100,000) so their actual rate of infection is going to be much higher - their 7 day rate is just kept artificially low by the amount of tests they're (not) doing.

Likewise we are moving to a world where case rate is less important and hospitalizations and deaths is a more critical metric - the comparable unvaccinated rate adjusts the score downwards for countries with low levels of serious cases, which is reflective of high levels of vaccination. As such this metric captures everything. 

This method is **not perfect** as countries account for positivity differently. For instance, some countries (e.g. UK, Italy) include lateral flow tests in overall testing rates and positivity whereas other countries (e.g. Germany) only include PCR so their rates will appear higher and testing rates will appear lower. In addition, countries may alter the way they account for serious cases. While it's important to use this metric to help smooth out countries not doing enough testing and relaxing restrictions in the face of high levels of vaccinations, remember that it's not perfect.

For Chinese nationals, getting a UK degree may be much easier than one from China, and will also seem more prestigious back home.

There is also the constant US press article of ""Chinese spies posing as students"", but let's leave that subject for the American subreddits.

Also, having enough money to study on the other side of the globe, in an expensive country with massive amounts of freedom, means that you don't always get ""hard-working students"" but also [the occasional ""rich spoiled-brat"" that thinks they can get away with anything](https://thetab.com/uk/belfast/2015/05/31/bail-chinese-northern-ireland-drug-scandal-8562).",,/r/europe/comments/p0mbsq/china_applicants_replace_eu_students_at_uk/h898w4v/,Lord_Frederick,1628488561

The Sevastopol naval base is really crucial mainly due to the [1936 Montreux treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreux_Convention_Regarding_the_Regime_of_the_Straits) that limited the presence of warships from non-Black Sea countries. That means that the Soviets only needed a token naval force in the region to match that of possible neighboring enemies, which was neutral Turkey. Funnily enough, [Stalin's pressure for joint control of the Bosforus/Dardanelles straits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Straits_crisis) actually lead to Turkey joining NATO.

A base in the Black Sea is so important for Russia, that fearing that they'll lose the Sevastopol base (as the lease was initially set to expire in 2017), Putin signed a treaty in 2003 to add a naval base to Novorossiysk, the largest Russian port, one of their few warm-water ports, situated only 300 km from Sevastopol.",,/r/europe/comments/p0lqm3/next_will_be_ukraine_the_magazine_cover_is_from/h88zna6/,Lord_Frederick,1628482071

1427,"Sure that's all fine and I applaud the parents for doing that. My point was that Australia has chosen their spearhead sport well because there are literally 37 events to gain a medal from. In my books, the non-swimming medals Aussies got from Tokyo seem more valuable because with swimming there simply is so many events that if a country like Australia goes nearly all in on it they'll get loads of medals.

Which is why I think Phelps' gold medal record doesn't really seem like *that* big of a deal. Yeah, he was a dominant swimmer but he also got an unbelievable amount of chances to prove that. Usain Bolt has done like a quarter of starts in olympics compared to Phelps even though he was just as dominant in his sport.

1732,"There was no point since the invasion when a real unification was available to us. 

Greek Cypriots are the ones who want reunifaction. Some TCs want unification as well, but for most of them it is a compromise. They wouldn't be too upset if partition was legalized, they just know that such thing happening is highly unlikly. 

So I would reverse what you said: It was a mistake for Akinci not to agree to uninification with Anastasiades. Akinci not only insisisted in what amounts to 50% power share for his 18% comminity, but he also supported the interests of Turkey when it comes to the Turkish troops, Turkish gurantees and Turkish settlers. 

With such terms Cyprus would be ""unified"" in name only, while in reality it would be officially partition into north and south. Even worst, the whole of the island would become a protectorate of Turkey. The point of a solution (for us) is to liberate the north, not to make the whole of Cyprus a bigger puppet state of Turkey.

Akinci should have been more reasonable in regards to the power sharing and accept a boosted representation  in the central goverment, and vetos on specific important issues (e.g. changes to the constidution) but not on everything. So boosted power share for TCs, but not quite 50%, since it is unacceptable to equate 18% with the 82%. 

Also, he should have agreed to get rid of Turkey and embrace EU instead. Only those Settlers who are in Cyprus for many years should be allowed to stay, the Turkish army should leave within a reasonable timeframe after the solution (e.g. 2-5 years), and the Greek-Turkish-British gurantees should be replaced by EU-NATO-UN gurantees. 

While Akinci isn't bullshiting the Turkich Cypriots that recognition of their pseudo state is just around the corner, and he knows that continuation of the status quo is harmful for his own community as well, he expected all the compromises to come from our side.

Compared to the 1960 agreements, we can accept that Turkish Cypriots can have their own federal state with complete autonomy within it (within EU rules). This is a huge compromise from our side, when you consider that this is a large part of Cyprus (close to 30%) which was inhabited by a great majority of Greek Cypriots before the invasion. 

But the TCs need to compromise as well. They need to accept that Greece-Turkey-UK will be replaced by EU, and that when it comes to Cyprus as a whole we should take decisions democratically as a single people, and not merely as a partnership of 2 separate entitites.",Cyprus,/r/europe/comments/ox63zk/official_thank_you_message_from_the_turkish_state/h87s9wc/,Ozyzen,1628459321

1874,"To be fair it's also easier to have a scouting system with fewer blind spots if you're a smaller country with a smaller population. A country like Germany that has a pretty dense population that's not really concentrated on big cities also has to cover a wider area to encompass the highest percentage of people with their scouting system than let's say France or the US who have their population concentrated on a smaller area. 

Out of 294 districts only 8 have a lower density than 50 people/km¬≤, the 100 or so biggest cities in Germany are not included in these districts since they are not part of a district, so they're not boosting that number. In contrast a whole 20 out of France's 101 departments have a density of less than 45 people/km¬≤ and I think (correct me if wrong) all cities are included in these departments so they might boost density numbers of an otherwise less populated department.

This is not supposed to take away credit from Dutch scouting systems, they're outstanding as far as I'm informed and we Germans had to learn a lot from it (and still aren't as effective in many sports). For example in football where our system was disastrous and they decided to invest more into it from \~2003 onward, copying different things from the outstanding football youth system in the Netherlands.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/p0azk7/dutch_besting_their_three_big_eu_brothers/h87e6p0/,matmoe1,1628452797

Athletes have it really hard here when it comes to income. While they are active, they have subsidies from the state (ADO) from which they can live with.

If they choose competing, as soon they stop being an elite athlete (which is very soon in their life), they stop receiving the subsidy and they find themselves in their 30s without work experience or studies. It is very tough for them.

Never said the Netherlands was good at the tour... but my fault didn‚Äôt know brits did so well recently that‚Äôs my mistake. F-1 yes Lewis Hamilton is an amazing driver (did need to kill Verstappen to win but whatever). I literally never said the UK is bad at sports however British people are so incredibly arrogant it‚Äôs insane.  this post was made to congratulate the Dutch on their incredible performance as such a small nation. Yet the brits colonize the comments and start disrespecting other nations (just like the Americans btw). it just the fucking arrogance that makes me sick. People from the UK always act like they are the best, and yes they are good but their are definitely not the best sporting nation cause there is none. making a claim that your nation is the best in all sports is just arrogant. And yes bigger nation have more people so will always have bigger presence in sports. However this does not mean smaller nations are worse at sports, it just means that their presence is more limited because they have no choice, these nation have to constantly push above their weight. Look at New Zealand they they have 4 million people and they have such an amazing presence in sports does that make them the best sports nation?!

I had no problems with the UK before since a year of 10 you guys have just become more arrogant constantly pushing other nations down.

2026,"Agree that proper studies are missing. I think the science is point the other way than you. But I agree, we need more studies.

Hiv can also be spread by blood, so would you want someone with HIV working with food. There is a risk of someone giving you an actual deadly disease. Personally I think health and safety measures in the food industry are sufficient and people shouldn't be discriminated against for having HIV. 


&gt; People who have unprotected sex spread diseases among themselves. People with respiratory illnesses spread them by going anywhere there are other people in close proximity.

&gt; To protect other people, therefore, you need to restrict the latter circumstance. 

Why do you need to restrict the latter. The vaccine reduces the symptoms of the illness so much that it's nothing but a bad cold for a few days. So what harm is there to a vaccinated person getting the illness?

&gt; You are not forced to get the vaccine, but you need to get it if you want to partake in certain activities. However there are already some mandatory vaccines, so I don't understand why this one is so controversial

This is blatantly political speak. What you are describing is coercion, the government (with some approval from a minority of the public apparently) is coercing people to get it. There are two reasons why this is different from mandatory traditional vaccines.

1. Long term studies have not been concluded on this vaccine and if something went wrong (which is very unlikely) there is no liability for the government or the pharma giants.

2. It doesn't make you immune. It is not a traditional immunising vaccine. You still get and spread covid. So the vaccine cannot eradicate covid. So the only difference between a vaccinated person and a unvaccinated person is the risk that the person chooses to take on as all it will effect is how strong your symptoms are.

I do think vaccines work, but the intensity of the government is creepy, uneuropean, and I am much more worried of having to check-in a qr code everywhere I go and have the government have a timeline of where I have been and how.",Catalonia (Spain),/r/europe/comments/p0akca/it_is_a_bit_annoying_italys_covid_pass/h86hm5u/,Doing_It_In_The_Butt,1628437701

&gt;Can confirm. Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) don't want them either, despite being ""their Muslim brothers"". People being against having them in Europe has more to do with their behaviour, than religion. Bosnians were welcoming at first, yet something changed. That ""something"" is realising how incompatible they are with us.

&gt;They have been attacking Bosnians, robbing them, breaking into their homes, raping at large... Each country in the Balkans has had their own share of experiences with them, despite the claims that they were only passing through.

&gt;An (allegedly) underage migrant had been given asylum in Croatia a year or two ago and put into children's home, only to rape a 16 y. o. girl living there (just a few months later).

&gt;Another one attempted to rape a girl in a public bathroom of a shopping centre in Zagreb, Croatia.

&gt;They attacked a Bosnian kid coming back from school, beat him and robbed him.

&gt;They broke into homes in Serbia, stole what they could and destroyed them.

&gt;There're a bunch of videos with evidence online, but the public ignores that side of the story.

2566,"Mont Blanc (Italian: Monte Bianco = white mountain) is the highest mountain in the Alps and Western Europe, rising 4,808 meters above sea level. It is the second-highest and second-most prominent mountain in Europe, after Mount Elbrus (5,642 m).

Located in the Alps, the massif lies along the French-Italian border and reaches into Switzerland. It extends southwestward from Martigny, Switzerland, for about 40 km and has a maximum width of 16 km. The summit is in French territory. 

Surrounding the massif are the Graian Alps (south), the Chamonix Valley and Savoy Alps (west), the Pennine Alps (northeast), and the Valley of Courmayeur (east). Other principal peaks within the massif include Mont Blanc du Tacul, Mont Maudit, Aiguille (‚ÄúPeak‚Äù) du G√©ant, Les Grandes Jorasses, Mont Dolent, and Aiguille du Midi.

Glaciers cover approximately 100 square km of Mont Blanc, whence its name. Ice streams stretch from the central ice dome down to below 1,550 metres. The Mer de Glace, the second longest glacier in the Alps, reached the elevation of 1,250 metres in 1930. At the beginning of the 17th century, glaciers advanced to the bottom of the Chamonix Valley, destroying or burying cultivated land and dwellings. Since that time, the glaciers have periodically advanced and retreated.

The summit was conquered on 8 August 1786 by Michel-Gabriel Paccard, a doctor from Chamonix, together with Jacques Balmat, his porter.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/p09avc/on_this_day_in_1786_mont_blanc_monte_bianco_on/h8549fw/,filosoful,1628402850

2624,"You're not completely wrong

However, a big difference between conservatives and progressives that I tend to see is also how realistic they are about the world. You said below that prostitution would disappear if widespread poverty and economic disparity would disappear and I tend to agree, although I do think there's always going to be a few people that want to get paid quite well for relatively low effort, and really don't mind to use their body. But anyway, the fact is, we're not in that situation yet. For now prostitution is quite abundantly present.

And the more you criminalize it, the less control you have. Actually in the Netherlands it's not 100% legal, because it is heavily regulated. Meaning that people that want to escape that regulation are still working under the radar, with worse conditions. While if it was 100% legal full stop, no one would have to hide it and bad pimps wouldn't be so much of a thing.

You don't think that making it illegal for buyers is gonna mean that prostitutes go through more effort to hide it, thus be much less visible when shit happens? Because that is what criminalizing the buyers does.

Making it illegal is just virtue-signaling. It‚Äôs gonna happen anyway. I moved from my home country the Netherlands to Indonesia where prostitution is completely illegal, but it happens EVERYWHERE. Now it just means that it happens in karaoke bars and massage salons that paid a bribe to the police.",,/r/europe/comments/ozs0b9/the_legality_of_prostitution_in_europe/h84upks/,ITG83,1628396205

This is definitely us.

[Tornado occurrence. More than 90% of the world tornadoes occur in the US. The US has 1200 tornados a year while the next country (Canada) has only about 100 and the 3rd country (the UK) has only about 30. (i.redd.it)](https://old.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/dgvh4k/tornado_occurrence_more_than_90_of_the_world/)

**Earthquakes**

https://maps.openquake.org/map/global-seismic-hazard-map/#2/40.2/-77.2

That looks like Italy and the Balkans and Romania get some, but Europe as a whole doesn't get much.  Turkey does get them, though.

**Hurricanes**

https://i.imgur.com/MLRI2qR.jpeg

Looks like this is mostly our Atlantic coast, the Carribbean, East and Southeast Asian coasts, and some around Madagascar and Australia.  Europe gets none.

**Wildfires**

https://i.imgur.com/MLRI2qR.jpeg

A lot in sub-Saharan Africa.  Our western states.  Eastern Brazil.  India and Southeast Asia and parts of Russia.  Europe gets some. 

**Hailstorms**


https://i.imgur.com/MLRI2qR.jpeg

We get a bunch in the southeast.  Some places in South America and Mexico.  Some scattered patches in Africa.  Eastern China and Europe both have large areas that get them, but it doesn't look like super-severe, except for along some Mediterranean states like Italy.

2784,"&gt;Did those people in power also come and kill the 7 people I knew who died from it, along with the million others? Is this like a shadow government where people in black suits come and kill people? 

???¬† Sorry but I'm not sure how this is relevant. I said that the virus never told leaders that the only way to ""solve"" the pandemic is to go into a lockdown and, in some cases, over a tiny amount of positive COVID cases. You were saying how the disease put a halt to the economies of the world and I just said that it was the leaders that made those decisions. I never mentioned a shadow government or anything like you think I'm saying. You're projecting what you want me to say for some reason. 

&gt;Where does your right to walk everywhere no matter what you are / are not spreading, and other people's right not to be subjected to people who deliberately choose to spread viruses at higher rates? 

Apparently, everyone can still spread anything. So we're now discriminating people based on rates?¬† And even in some cases like what Boris Johnson said a while back, a negative test might not be enough either. In fact, somewhat rhetorical question, but why not require tests instead?¬† One supposedly says ""I don't have it"" and the other says ""My symptoms won't be bad, but I can still get and spread it and possibly die from it"".¬† 
¬† 
&gt;This is the same analogy as the government taking away your ability to drive because you need a driver's licence.... At the same time, what about the protection of others to walk in the street and not be endangered by drivers without a licence / proper training.... 

There's risk of death with everything and we cannot eliminate death. People say they take the vaccine not because it eliminates COVID, but because it lessens symptoms and makes death unlikely. That says everything right there. The people who want that will take it and receive the supposed benefits of not getting bad symptoms. I didn't know the vaccine works so well that it actually doesn't work unless everybody else on Earth has it and it only works if we ban unvaccinated people from everything. It doesn't mean we should create a two tiered society based on whether or not they have it.¬† A driver's license doesn't stop anybody from doing anything, it just means they passed a test. Even then, people are still allowed to ride a bus, go to the gym, shop, have a job even if they don't have a license. 

&gt;You know, ""free"" society never works, because I have different standards than you. 

&gt;I feel I should be able to walk around with a machine gun and bazooka for my own reasons and safety... But I can't, because enough people have proven the case that people are stupid and it's unsafe. 

&gt;I wanna drive at 160, because it makes me feel free, and I drive like a champion... But I can't because enough people have proven that it's unsafe. 

&gt;My friend takes drugs like a champ, and makes him feel free, but we can't do it, because too many people have proven that most people can't handle it, and went and stab their kids. 

&gt;My neighbor wanted the freedom to do in him home what he wanted, so he created a self sustaining electrical system... But now we have rules against that, because there was a small fire L, and a firefighter got electricuted and died because of his system. 

You are equating people not wanting a vaccine with people carrying rocket launchers and driving like an F1 veteran. The level of risk is not at all comparable.¬† These comparisons are not getting the desired effect. Would you honestly walk into a place of business and be going about your day as normal, then when you realize someone in there isn't vaccinated for COVID, but looks fine and healthy, that something just snaps and all of a sudden everyone's life is in danger?¬† Even if you're vaccinated?¬† 

I don't care about living somewhere with high vaccination rates, I'm sure people have their own reasons and personal circumstances for getting it; I care about restrictions, deceit, and mandates. So rich of you to insinuate I'm the asshole. You're just constantly putting words in my mouth and making it seem like my thought process is ""Ah hah, only I know what's really going on hahaha!¬† These idiots"".¬† Is there no possible valid reason why someone could not want the COVID vaccine?¬† Do those people deserve to be banned from public transportation?¬† Is any qualm about mandates and lockdowns and the rhetoric used by leaders not reasonable at all?¬† You can't even concede that somebody somewhere should be allowed to refuse the vaccine and be able to ride a bus to work. The crux of the issue (or one of them) is that you're treating this like it's worth discriminating people in all facets of life over, and it's just not. This isn't the Black Plague; this isn't a zombie apocalypse. We can compare COVID with smallpox and polio if you want, but thr bottom line is that the data is not as bad and you're still allowed to ride the bus if you're not protected. People get hurt from it and it sucks and people should take their own health seriously, but the answer isn't to do what all these countries are doing, and we should be able to acknowledge that. This is nothing more than be saying ""This is not the solution"".¬† The vaccines are effective right, now time to stop with these mandates. You're protected, now enjoy life if you want. If you don't, that's cool too. Mandates are not the answer for a supposedly free and liberal society.¬†",,/r/europe/comments/oza3i6/italians_must_now_show_a_green_pass_for_indoor/h84nyz4/,DCComics52,1628392211

Simplified greatly, they are both about elites supported by masses having had enough of the old, wanting something new. At least that‚Äôs been a necessary prerequisite. 

&gt;	Right, and Belgrade in 1999, Iraq, Libya and etc. didn‚Äôt want the American way? 

Well there‚Äôs also the European way. Much more chill. Russia also drops lots of bombs, perhaps less than US but that‚Äôs just because they can‚Äôt afford more.

Ok correct. But then the president got poisoned.. 

&gt;	It was a revolution, not a coup‚Ä¶

&gt;	Depends on the perspective, but that‚Äôs, again, beside the point.

No, it depends on the correct use of words and factual events. I had good friends on Maidan, it was a primarily a people‚Äôs movement, end of story. 

US, their hawks especially, was of course getting excited about influencing the final outcome. But it wasn‚Äôt driven by them, the protestors would have done it anyway. I don‚Äôt think prawy sector would have listened to some diplomat in a suit.

After Italy unification, they were already stationed in most of these rural places in southern italy and remained like some sort of local police force, so they were used as a replacement to the national police which was still forming and didn't have such a capillary reach, especially in southern Italy were the monarchy was weaker.

3085,"&gt;The virus didn't tell the leaders in Canada, Australia, etc to lockdown whole provinces because of a couple positive cases.  If people have the vaccine, aren't they protected from ""severe symptoms and dying""?
&gt;

Did those people in power also come and kill the 7 people I knew who died from it, along with the million others? Is this like a shadow government where people in black suits come and kill people? 

Where does your right to walk everywhere no matter what you are / are not spreading, and other people's right not to be subjected to people who deliberately choose to spread viruses at higher rates? 

.... This is the same analogy as the government taking away your ability to drive because you need a driver's licence.... At the same time, what about the protection of others to walk in the street and not be endangered by drivers without a licence / proper training.... 

Or since covid is a virus, and vaccine/ group immunity can greatly limit the amount of sickness and death. 

Do you feel you have some right to go unvaccinated from chickenpox, Polio, etc... 
... While the general consensus is to take preventable steps to almost entire whipe out these illnesses from our society.. 


.... Actually, I'm all for creating a free country, where all people against vaccines can live freely from oppression.... They can have their own community where you chose for 3 out of 10 of your children will die when 1 kid gets smallpox in school. 

Polio vaccination became mandatory in 1955, and in 1979, and it was wiped out in the US because of it. 

case fatality ratio for paralytic polio is generally 2% to 5% among children and up to 15% to 30% among adolescents and adults.

Yes, I would grant you your freedom to not have been forced vaccinated from this. Just as long as I and the people I know never have to come in contact with you. 




&gt;I have yet to see how the clothes comparison makes any sense beyond both things being required.  With that logic, why don't we require people use a passcode to gain entrance into a store?  It's just another requirement, in the same way we need clothes to go into a building. 
&gt;

Passcodes don't save lives.  And not having a passcode won't make you spread a passcode virus. 


&gt;
&gt;People have valid reasons to not want the COVID vaccine and people with power all of a sudden pulling the rug out from under them and denying them the ability to enjoy their ""free"" society that they've enjoyed their whole life is wrong.  People, no matter their vaccination status, should see how this is dangerous and undermines basic rights.

You know, ""free"" society never works, because I have different standards than you.

I feel I should be able to walk around with a machine gun and bazooka for my own reasons and safety... But I can't, because enough people have proven the case that people are stupid and it's unsafe.

I wanna drive at 160, because it makes me feel free, and I drive like a champion... But I can't because enough people have proven that it's unsafe.

The most liberal prostitution law is not found in Europe, but in New Zealand, where sex work is treated basically like any other job: just like you don't make it so that an engineer or a nurse can only work in certain parts of cities or only as employees, so it is for prostitution. Street prostitution is legal, which makes it so that poor people who rely on it for income are not cut out by having to move to cities or have special building requirements, truly independent prostitution is legal (not just inside authorised establishments but at home or hotels too) and then brothels are also legal.

&gt;At 8:00 am on 1 August, an improvised explosive device detonated on the road near Tskhinvali and hit a Georgian police lorry, wounding five Georgian police officers. In response, Georgian snipers assaulted some of the South Ossetian positions, killing four Ossetians and wounding seven.\[125\] According to majority of reports, the South Ossetians were responsible for instigating the bomb explosion which marked the opening of hostilities.\[126\]

This caused Georgian peacekeepers and servicemen in the area to return fire.\[32\]\[33\]\[34\]\[35\]\[127\]\[128\] Grenades and mortar fire were exchanged during the night of 1/2 August. The total Ossetian fatalities became six and the total wounded were now fifteen, among them several civilians; the Georgian casualties were six wounded civilians and one wounded policeman.\[125\] According to the OSCE mission, the incident was the worst outbreak of violence since 2004.\[129\] On 2‚Äì3 and again on 3‚Äì4 August, firing recommenced during the night.\[129\] A 1992 ceasefire agreement was breached by Ossetian artillery attacks.\[37\]\[38\]",,/r/europe/comments/ozqyst/today_marks_13_years_since_08082008_russias_war/h81p90z/,Greener_alien,1628337398

3492,"After the development of the all-metal boule, p√©tanque spread rapidly from Provence to the rest of France, then to the rest of Europe, and then to Francophone colonies and countries around the globe. **Today, many countries have their own national governing bodies.**

In France, the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de P√©tanque et Jeu Proven√ßal (FFPJP) has more than 300,000 licensed members.

There are strong national federations in Germany, Spain, and England. Petanque is actively played in many nations with histories of French colonial influence, especially in Southeast Asia, including Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Puducherry, India, as well as some parts of Africa. Today, some of the strongest players in the world come from Madagascar and Thailand.

P√©tanque was featured at the 2015 All-Africa Games, which were hosted by the Republic of Congo, a former French colony.[5]

Petanque is not widely played in the Americas. There is a Canadian petanque federation based in Qu√©bec. In the United States the Federation of Petanque USA (FPUSA) reports that about 30,000 play nationwide. As of 1 December 2015, FPUSA counted 2141 members in the US, in 52 affiliated clubs.[6]

On the international level, the governing body of petanque is the F√©d√©ration Internationale de P√©tanque et Jeu Proven√ßal (FIPJP). It was founded in 1958 in Marseille and has about 600,000 members **in 52 countries** as of 2002.

It is normal for Greece to be very dry and hot during the summer, and the species of pine trees that make up most of the forests here are highly, highly flammable, they're not like the ones you find in Cali. Forests are highly flammable every year, regardless of the weather that year. It is our responsibility to gather up dry, dead branches and do control burns to protect the forests close to houses, but this was not done of course. Also, the weather wasn't particularly stacked up against us this time. The wind was very weak to non existent. The fire isn't even spreading particularly fast, the furthest point it reached over like 3 days or so was not even 10km away, it's just that they can't stop it.

So really the climate this year just wasn't the greatest factor, it's just that we have multiple arsonists, both intentional and unintentional (badly maintained electricity poles is another big risk factor) and firefighting infrastructure is crumbling just like all infrastructure so fires are just not contained.

- native vegetation which is better at capturing CO2 is destroyed,

- fungal systems needed to lastingly store CO2 in soil are destroyed,

- heavy machinery used for terracing, planting, maintenance and harvesting turn the soil upside down, thus releasing CO2 into the atmosphere (heavy machinery also use a lot of fossil fuels),

- most harvested wood will sooner or later end up back in the atmosphere.

Thus, while it is true that in some regions, like Europe, forest coverage actually increases, that doesn't mean more CO2 sequestration. On the contrary.

3996,"&gt; Yep. This aint mocking.

Alright. ""Man, Athens is literally burning right now and you are still here trolling on the internet."" Come on, go put off the fire. Your capital is burning as we speak.

Roman Capital was Roma and it never fell to Muslims. Only your capital did. How come Russians, British, French, Italians never lost their capitals to Muslims but only Greeks did?

To the point, where Netflix makes a documentary called ""Rise of Ottomans"" to show it to whole world? Aren't you ashamed of your country being so tiny compared to Turkey when they came from Central Asia?

&gt;Meanwhile : Yesssss. That shows, how superior we are to you guys. Good that you understood that.
    Your gdp is almost 3 times smaller than New Jersey, what can I say more to that? Hahahahaha. It's New Jersey, bro lol. I was born in here and live here. I'm American. Your Prime Minister comes to our country to get his college education hahahaha.

How are you superior? We came from Central Asia and slapped you. We got %700 bigger country than you. We have bigger GDP than you. We have %900 bigger population than you. We're #2nd biggest military in NATO and you're biggest #17 military in NATO. How are you superior, really? In which aspect? Forget about Turkey, you are smaller than Istanbul lmao.

&gt; Historians are pretty clear about this topic. Only ultra nationalists claim otherwise.

Yes, Historians are very clear about this topic. This is why, International Court of Hague didn't have any conclusive decision about the case because for somehow, Armenia doesn't want to take it to court. I guess, they're scared. Why don't they take this issue to court? And why does %74 of the countries in the world deny it? Hmmmm. Let's think about that.

&gt; Nope. They don't deny it. The haven't fully recognised it yet. There are only 2 countries in the world who deny this : Turkey and Azerbaijan. 

Israel too. Guess what? They hate Turkey. %74 of the countries in the world DENY so-called Armenian genocide. Never happened until Armenia takes it to International Court in Hague. Why don't they go to court? Are they scared of something?

&gt;tupid points. Byzantine empire survived for more than 1000 years and eventually fell. So ? How can you compare the modern era with 1071 ? Or 1204 ? Literally 600 years past before the fall of Constantinople and yu compare that with Bolivians attacking the USA. I guess major in history is pretty easy in the US.

Exactly. What made you fell? Turks, right? Turks came to beat you in Anatolia and ended Byzantium era? Thank you for noticing it. So you accept the fact that Turks conquered you and beat you. Greeks have lived in the region for 3000 years and Turks lived around 1000 years but yet, Turks have bigger country by %700 because Greeks sleep all afternoon and being lazy. That is why. Look at how tiny your country is lol

&gt; Truth hurts, bro. I didn't lose %75 of our lands to Central Asian tribes. You did. Why are you so hurt? Why do you get so hurt when I state the obvious? I love the fact you avoid answering the most simple questions. Really smart of ya.

Yes, you did.

Numbers speak for itself. Let's compare:

Turkey/Area: 783,562 km¬≤ and then: Greece/Area 131,957 km. Why is your country so small compared to Turkey, especially when you lived in the region 3000 years and Turks lived around 1000 years? Who lost %75 lands to other nation? I'd assume Greeks, since they lived in Anatolia way more.

Don't you have to have bigger lands since you lived in the region way more than Turks? Can Bolivians or Brazilians come to North America and have bigger lands than us? Hell no. How come Turks have so much bigger country than you, including Constantinople? Lmaooo.

I'll tell you why, because they beat your tiny, weak country. Thats why.

&gt; As i said, none of these countries were even close to a Muslim country. You don't have points and you throw random facts hoping you can bait me. Sad.

So? Ottomans were close to Vienna too. They didn't lose their city to Ottomans. Why did you lose yours? Austrians fought and won, never lost their capital to Turks. Why did you lose your capital to Turks? 

&gt; Another lie. You trully live in a fantasy world. Anyway, i had enough of this. Continue living in your dream world bruh.

Didn't Turks convert Hagia Sophia to Mosque last year? Do you want a proof? Hagia Sophia is the most famous Greek church in the world since it was your capital but it's mosque now.

4081,"Long story short:

* Yugoslavia consisted out of many cultures, with Serbs being a relative majority at \~37%, Croats coming in at \~20% of the Yugoslavian population.
* They've been the playground of empires for centuries, but the Cold War had just ended, the empires were gone, and Yugoslavia wasnt exactly prospering.
* A wave of nationalism had been going around, and with it the wish for self-determination, which the Serbs kinda already had, given their numbers.
* Ethnic groups started to break away, but geographic/historic borders didn't equal cultural borders, so many Serbs risked going from majority to minority status.
* Butts were hurt, jimmies were rustled, shots got fired, and all hell broke loose.

Can't blame people for wanting self-determination, and also can't blame people for not wanting to become a minority group in a nationalistic country.

4136,"For a bit of context, around 1990 the computer science community was badly in need of a central, generalized paradigm for publishing (and finding!) information using the fledgling Internet. The WWW/HTTP/HTML was only one of the technologies proposed to achieve that. Other notable ones were [WAIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_information_server) and [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_\(protocol\)), which actually competed with the WWW for most of the decade.

However, they were different from WWW in a couple of ways which later turned out to be critical.

1. The information on WAIS/Gopher had to follow a very precise structure. While this structure gave them a clear advantage in the eyes of the scientists, regular people didn't care much for it. HTML was much more forgiving and easier to get started with. It was actually the complete opposite of the other two, it completely lacked any way of enforcing any kind of information structure and even writing the HTML wrong was OK. People loved it.
2. The technology behind WWW was made completely free (both in the sense of freedom and gratis) by CERN from day one. By contrast, WAIS and Gopher toyed with attempts to make their technology commercial which undermined the geeks' trust in it.
3. The three key pieces that formed the WWW technology (the browser, the webserver and the document format) had a briliant design. They were simple, robust, yet easy to extend. This made it possible for them to gain some mind-blowing improvements during the 90s. Cascading Style Sheets was a way of thinking about documents that paved the way towards separating presentation, structure and content. JavaScript let people run programs in the browser and make the documents interact with the visitors, while SSI and CGI allowed them to run programs on the web servers and enabled the creation of super-useful features (user login, storing data between visits, server computing power etc.)",üá™üá∫ European Union,/r/europe/comments/oz0480/on_august_6_1991_without_fanfare_british_computer/h7zj8ln/,kare_kano,1628286907

4175,"I'm well aware that most people will survive Covid.
But if you risk it for no good reason it becomes suicide when it happens.

But roughly 1% is a high risk when it's about death. Few people would enter a plane with a 1% crash rate.

Also that is the overall chance of dying. The very young have a much higher chance of survival and if you're older your chance goes down.. And as you said yourself, various conditions increase that chance significantly. Not all of which would have otherwise killed you shortly anyway.

But it's also important to realize 2 things:
1) Death is not the only possible symptom that's worthwhile to avoid. Recovering after days of intensive care is not a fun experience and takes up valuable resources. Long term health damage is also a consideration.

2) We let this pandemic rage on unchecked, we breed more variants. 

This is not dehumanizing at all. I haven't argued for anti-vaxx camps. I'm not even supporting mandatory vaccinations (regardless of how efficient that would be). I want people to be free to make choices for their own bodies. But you also have to live with the consequences of your choice.
The careless ignorance of anti-vaxxers OTOH expects the 4esr if us to be ok with them needlessly endangering everybody else, based on unscientific arguments often based on insane conspiracy theories (5G, Bill Gates, vaccines kill, vaccines are satanic and other crap like that).

Again, you remain free to believe whatever you want and not get vaccinated. Just like we remain free to not want to be in a room with you while you do that. You don't  want to be vaccinated, why do you think you should be able to work as a nurse, while potentially killing more than 1% of your patients? (The vulnerability of patients is obviously much higher than in the population at large). That's a selfish and careless stance.

And it's not a pretence. There's actually a pandemic, people are actually suffering, health systems, economies and society are actually stressed.
And luckily we do have something that helps against this pandemic.

Your assumptions about me personally happen to be 100% wrong. I hate fascists, I couldn't care less what you do as long as you don't play with explosives and I like that there are differences. The last thing I want is a boring world where everybody is the same.",,/r/europe/comments/oyfb2o/germany_and_france_will_go_ahead_with_covid19/h7zk2ca/,Oerthling,1628287286

4352,"&gt;The first representative body of legislative power was created in the Russian Empire in 1905 as result of the revolution. On 6 August 1905, Emperor Nicholas II issued a Manifesto on Establishment and Organisational Rules of one of the parliament chambers ‚Äì the State Duma. The State Council of the Russian Empire became the second chamber. The Duma should have exercised only quasi-legislative function. However, on 17 October 1905, the Emperor signed a new Manifesto establishing that no law could enter into force without an approval of the State Duma.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus the State Duma was transformed from an advisory body to a legislative organ. Overall four Dumas gathered till 1917. The Duma consisted of landowners, representatives of the industrial middle class, merchants, city intellectuals, and peasants. A total number of elected delegates of the Duma varied from 478 to 525 in different years.

4355,"&gt;We literally had stats on the BBC within days of the election where labour voters switching to the Tories gave brexit as the number one reason, followed by Corbyn‚Äôs leadership, followed by labour policy. It‚Äôs not me that‚Äôs coming up with that, it‚Äôs labour voters. But of course a Czech knows more about this than the actual electorate that voted in the election.

Yes, please keep ignoring the fact that more people switched to LibDems. If I was in your position and had nothing to say to that fact provided by YouGov, a British company, I too would just keep reiterating what I said previously despite the facts, until I would drop dead.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Has it not occurred to you that the super duper remainer Kier Starmer hasn‚Äôt backed a rejoin policy for a reason? Why is it do you think? Do you think it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs not a madman?

Or because he's making a mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Also you can‚Äôt take absolute percentages like you are doing because you‚Äôre not considering the effect in constituencies and how the rejoin vote is distributed (note they thinking brexit was a mistake does not necessarily mean that person would vote rejoin).

True, but then again I don't see you providing arguments for a particular Brexit stance being a neccessity towards a constituency winning strategy.

&gt;All the election polls have the Tories winning (by percentage and by seats) so I‚Äôm really not sure why you‚Äôre so obsessed with pushing rejoin when it‚Äôs basically dead in the UK.

\&gt;We should trust the expert stance of Keir Starmer

\&gt;All the election polls have the Tories winning

Well I don't know, but polls also say a majority supports Remainer vote.

4426,"&gt;I'm not seeing British advertising so I don't know if it's true black peopel are overrepresented compared to the population.

It's *possibly* true in terms of raw numbers but the other thing that's true is that minorities on TV as anything other than complete stereotypes is a relatively new thing in the UK, and usually when people say it's 'overdone' what they mean is they're seeing to many black people (or gay people or whatever) in roles that were previously the reserve of straight white people (even in adverts - think the 'happy family' archetype) - and they don't like it.

On its own what the poster said *is* pretty innocuous, I agree... but the fact that they felt the compulsion to say it *here* \- in response to *this* article - is really important context imo.

4429,"&gt;Yet you are assuming that German and Italian fascism were equal enough to compare Portuguese fascism to, which is absolutely not true. 

No, i'm not.

I explicitly did not go into the differences between the Italian and German regimes (of which there are many).

I placed them under the ""Fascism"" umbrella because they are both often called such, not because it is a consistent designation. Realistically speaking i should have only needed to talk about the differences between the Italian and the Portuguese Estado Novo, given that the Italian version is what actually gave the name ""fascism"". I merely referenced the German regime in order to forestall any irrelevant and equally erroneous arguments that you no doubt would have made had i not referenced the differences between the germand and Portuguese Estado novos systems.

&gt;Also fascist parties had internal ideological distinctions between members, you are the one who is assuming fascist parties are singular ideological blocks, which they were not. The Italian fascist party had many members which included Italian nationalists, fascist socialists and capitalist entrepreneurs. The same goes for the Nazi party, who had Strasserist national socialists, white nationalists and capitalist industrialists. The homogeneity of German fascism only started after multiple internal purges.

Again you deliberately misrepresent my point. I did not in any way state that either the german or italian regimes were ""homogenous"", all i stated was that they had an ideological component to its single party, whereas the Portuguese Estado Novo did not. 

A good analogy to that distinction was that if we were to see those 3 political parties as drinking cups, the german and italian cups are full of liquids whereas the portuguese cup is empty. The Uni√£o Nacional had no driving ideology, and indeed its entire relationship with the state was totally unlike the german or italian models. 

&gt;What about Spanish fascism? It also had it's own historical and ideological intricacies that were different to German or Italian fascism, yet it was still fascism.

I'm not making any statements on Francos regime because i'm not an expert on it. I will merely say that it was distinct in several ways from the Portuguese Estado novo.

&gt;You are the one that assumes all fascism must be identical to Italian or German fascism to be fascism, which is absolutely not true.

Realistically they must be similar to the Italian model, since that is what gave the ideology its name. The portuguese estado novo was not.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/oz1rgu/capital_punishment_in_europe/h7y4v24/,Coyote-Cultural,1628265111

4469,"&gt;Why is it wrong for white majority countries to exist 

Sorry, who in this thread, or elsewhere is suggesting that it's wrong for white majority countries to exist? The issues tend to come from ethnonationalism, where someone from a white (or black, or asian..) majority country takes a position that you can only be part of that country if you are part of the majority. The UK, Germany and France are all white majority countries, but they also have non-white citizens who are as British/German/French as a white citizen might be (or potentially more so given you also see a lot of ethnically white migration to those countries...). 

More broadly though, fascism is an ideology that could rightly be regarded as evil, it's authoritarian, anti-individual, corporatist, harms freedoms generally etc.. so opposition to that shouldn't be particularly surprising.

Generalplan Ost was planned as an unprecedented genocidal project, taking place after the final German victory on the eastern front, and this victory never happened. **But,** in the autumn of 1942 Nazi leadership became so impatient, that they started to execute this plan by deporting and exterminating Polish population from Zamo≈õƒá region (*Zamojszczyna).* More than 100 000 Poles was deported, and at least 21% of them (including children) murdered in gass chambers in Auschwitz, and German settlers were brought in their place.  The second part of this action happened in **June of 1943**, so in time when Germans were in a full retreat basically everywhere. There is two volume book in Polish ""Okupacja i ruch oporu w dzienniku Hansa Franka"" (""Occupation and the resistance movement in Hans Frank diary""), which includes exclusively German documents from Nazi occupation of Poland. There are many papers, including minutes from Nazi officials conferences, where it's made absolutely clear by its participants, even in 1944, that ""German task of colonisation of the East will never be abandoned"".",,/r/europe/comments/oz6cz9/generalplan_ost_in_numbers_source_in_comments/h7y5gp6/,abdefff,1628265364

In principle I agree with you that the average immigrant will emit more CO2 by coming to a rich nation compared to staying in a poor country. 

But allowing mass immigration is pretty unpopular. Even recent immigrants are often against mass immigration. 

Some years we will see more immigration than others but I think it will never be enough to grow the population rapidly.

Instead of worrying about immigration, we should focus on reducing the climate impact of everyone in Europe by generating electricity and heat without polluting and putting more effort in public transportation, cycling and working from home to reduce transport emissions. 

Eventually immigrants coming to Europe will pollute less than when they would stay in their country of origin.

Just 2 days ago a black family had to flee their home in Forney, Texas to an undisclosed location. They were afraid for their lives after a slew of death threats stemming from a video showing a police officer straddling the mother while she screamed that she couldn't breathe. It made the news.

So it comes that most on production wasn't needed anymore as it wouldn't be profitable in terms of market. And this is related to every sphere of economy.
Consider also that we were in socialist prison for 70 years and people just couldn't instantly switch to capitalism and have a mindset of a Europeans that were free people last 300h years. Thus we had what's called bandit capitalism, which is really really bad for the country overall.

I completely and utterly agree. But just on the point of Winnipeg in particular. Doesn't it also have the ""continental effect"" of being at least 500KM from the nearest ocean? Just like Moscow today experiences worse winters than Copenhagen, while the Golf Stream is flowing. Obviously the Golf Stream is helping keep Copenhagen warm, but even without it I would have thought that we can expect that being adjacent to the sea would moderate winter temperatures. 

Compare Winnipeg and Anchorage, even though Anchorage is significantly more northerly it experiences slightly warmer winters than Winnipeg.

I am unsure if the writer of this article is not allowed to write about it or does not know that all of it is the game which current politicians play in Serbia. To them, the only thing that matters is staying in power - everything else is second to that which includes Serbian citizens. They like to be in the limbo between East and West as it gives them enough power to play demi-gods in a small country while throwing sand in the eyes of Serbian citizens and constantly keep them ignorant of what is going on. EU is tired of this game and could not be bothered to change the way how to gain favour of Serbian citizens, which is perfect for the current regime. Russia is always portrayed as a big Serbian ally and there is this belief that Russians will help Serbs no matter what - at the same time, majority of Serbs blindly ignore the fact that Russia did little to nothing to protect Serbia and Serbian citizens in the events during and after war in Yugoslavia. Instead, all those events are used for political trolling thus ignoring the most important fact: people lost their lives!!! Secondly: Serbs are delusional about Kosovo as Belgrade lost sovereignty over Kosovo, they still claim Kosovo is Serbia and yet reality is laws imposed in Belgrade have no effect on citizens of Kosovo. So, in their delusions, they believe that with the help of Russia, they will get Kosovo back. China on the other hand is strictly focused on their interest in the long run and for it is bribing their way in Serbia through petty politicians and it is ironic that same thing was happening to Serbia before Ottomans came.


In order for the situation in Serbia to change, a revolution is required. Not necessarily the same as Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá was overthrown but big enough to open the eyes of Serbian citizens.

No, but you seem to be willing to ignore all scientific papers that don't look at a hundred thousand years in the past before concluding something. You even ignore the 9000 year chart for not being long enough despite it encompassing the entire era of human civilization.

&gt;You could compare nuclear winters with massive volcanic eruptions and impacts of asteroids that had a lot of radioactive materials in them but not with what you mentioned, no asteroid that ever hit the Earth (except maybe the one killing the dinosaurs) had so much radioactive materials as all of the worlds nuclear weapons.

Oh, so it's fine to do conclusions about the atmosphere with only a few years of data in some situations but not others and those happen to perfectly align with your own opinions. How convenient. There has also never been another event where the atmospheric Co2 concentrations have doubled in a single century but we're 3/4 of the way there so.

&gt;The internet is free as are all the scientific papers. Scientific papers are all around you. You found one graph that had all the needed data, now find others. Or perhaps find the paperwork behind these graphs, maybe the paper contains much more data than this insufficient image.

You just listed even more reasons why you should have just found the graphs yourself instead of just complaining.

&gt;This scale has not enough data. You behave like I'm talking bs and disapprove climate change for some reason, yet I only disprove this data as it is insufficient.

No, I'm behaving like someone who is annoyed at lazy people online just complaining about others while doing nothing themselves.

Conditions where a hormones of sex are found in the other are more common and many of these occur due to certain conditions and from birth for example in post menopause where at times women report higher testosterone levels that doesn‚Äôt mean the the definition of female is somehow unambiguous it is just a phenomenon which occurs to women after menopause. Considering discrepancies in hormones as a paradigm to illustrate how sex is not definable is stupid, these hormones fluctuate throughout a persons life. The genetic and physical components are stable in most cases and the endocrine component although variable is also time dependent. Using the 5% discrepancies to dilute the definitions of sex is not something I favour. Most of the time male and female categories serve both male and females better in sport. Most women football teams can be easily defeated by u-16 male football teams and this has happened many a times. Most women have the capability to birth a child, women are also more empathetic in most cases and I have a research article to second that(https://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/womens-brains-show-more-empathy) hence they make better maternal figures.

There's plenty of papers out there about how testocerone affects muscle mass, and how that affects different sports (hell, you've probably read and maybe cited some!). But at a certain point, you can't tell how fast someone can run by analysing their muscles - you need to see how fast they do 100m.

And you're never going to answer that question in a trans-exclusionary environment, because 100m sprinters dedicate their entire being to their training. And no trans athletes would do that if they were excluded from elite competition.

So we have to let trans women compete, in order to get any data at all. It might turn out, retrospectively, it wasn't fair, but we just can't know without trying.

So, I was wrong.

There are complicating questions around the genetics which are actually pretty tough to give an adequate answer to because you ultimately have to be pretty blessed genetically to be a world class athlete in either case. But the medical science looks at comparative advantages of trans women and cis women and adjust based on what seems like an unfair advantage without invoking genetics wherever possible when it comes to sports.

5099,"A State Security Administration (SSA) serviceman is being investigated after allegedly attacking a man in central Kyiv on Aug. 1.

Yevhen Honcharenko, a backup dancer for Ukrainian pop singer Nadya Dorofeeva, was assaulted outside of Lift, a gay nightclub in Kyiv. He was hospitalized with a brain hemorrhage and placed in a medically induced coma, according to Dorofeeva.

The SSA, a law enforcement agency that provides security to state officials, has removed suspect Yevhen Bezpalyi from duty during an internal investigation. The State Bureau of Investigations (DBR), the state agency that investigates criminal proceedings involving law enforcement officers, judges and senior officials, suspects Bezpalyi of intentional grievous bodily harm.

KyivPride, an LGBTQ advocacy nonprofit, cited the victim‚Äôs friends in labeling the attack as homophobic and provoked by Goncharenko‚Äôs gender non-conforming looks.

‚ÄúHow many more incidents of this kind do we need for attacks to stop?‚Äù KyivPride wrote on Instagram.

According to Dorofeeva, Goncharenko left the nightclub with friends and was first pushed, then hit against a fence repeatedly.

The DBR said that the attacker hit the young man hard in the face, causing him a severe closed traumatic brain injury, a concussion, a linear fracture of the temporal bone and other injuries.

Dorofeeva posted images and a video of Bezpalyi as a public plea to ask for help in identifying the man.

Soon after that, in a rare instance of state agencies acknowledging the possible involvement of their employees in criminal actions, the SSA confirmed the identity of the alleged attacker. In an official statement published on Aug. 1, the SSA said it would cooperate with the investigation and provide Honcharenko with any help needed for his treatment.

The DBR started criminal proceedings into the assault, according to an official statement published on Aug. 2. The bureau said it had interrogated witnesses and obtained video recordings from surveillance cameras and witnesses.

If found guilty, Bezpalyi faces up to eight years in prison.

The accident comes just days after the Rave Pride protest for LGBTQ rights took place outside of the President‚Äôs Office on July 30. Rave Pride was delayed because of the attacks by far-right groups.

Despite Ukraine‚Äôs progress in the area of human rights, attacks on the LGBTQ community are still rampant. Some are committed by organized far-right groups, others by regular individuals.

If investigated, these incidents are not identified as hate crimes on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, since Ukrainian legislation doesn‚Äôt provide for such criminal liability. Local human rights activists have been advocating for legal protection for the community for years.

Prime Minister Dmytro Shmygal introduced a bill that ensures criminal liability in cases of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity on May 13. Human rights and civil organizations have been actively campaigning for the adoption of the bill since but it hasn‚Äôt been considered by the parliament yet.",,/r/europe/comments/oyytdk/man_in_coma_after_alleged_homophobic_attack_by/h7wcw86/,goodpoll,1628224216

Yep. This aint mocking. Talking about ""how Greeks run in 1921"" or "" haha , other empires didn't lose their capitals, you Greeks sleep all day "" is.

And btw, how stupid can this argument be ? London were never even close to any Muslim country, how could it fall ?

Roman empire didn't exist when Muslims came to be. The last Roman capital fell in 1453. Read some history.

Historians are pretty clear about this topic. Only ultra nationalists claim otherwise.

&gt;%74 of the countries DENY the Armenian genocide,

Nope. They don't deny it. The haven't fully recognised it **yet.** There are only 2 countries in the world who deny this : Turkey and Azerbaijan. 

Israel can't recognise the genocide because of the Palestinian topic. This is truly politics.

&gt;Can Bolivians come to North America right now and own %75 of our lands? Hahahaha. Let them try it lol.

Stupid points. Byzantine empire survived for more than 1000 years and eventually fell. So ? How can you compare the modern era with 1071  ? Or 1204 ? Literally 600 years past before the fall of Constantinople and yu compare that with Bolivians attacking the USA.  I guess major in history is pretty easy in the US.

&gt;You failed to provide 1 comment where you support Greece. Not against Turkey. Just not shitting on Greeks. You are really obsessed man. I do feel bad for you. One of the main reasons i changed my previous comment.  
  
Truth hurts, bro. I didn't lose %75 of our lands to Central Asian tribes. You did. Why are you so hurt? Why do you get so hurt when I state the obvious?

I love the fact you avoid answering the most simple questions. Really smart of ya.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;British Empire didn't lose London to Muslims. Roman Empire didn't lose Rome to Muslims. French Empire didn't lose Paris to Muslims. Russian Empire didn't lose Moscow to Muslims but you HAVE LOST Constantinople to Muslims along with HAGIA SOPHIA. Why are you so hurt when I state the obvious?

As i said, none of these countries were even close to a Muslim country. You don't have points and you throw random facts hoping you can bait me. Sad.

&amp;#x200B;

5356,"AKP: Ruling party. Came out of the once rather weak and ever getting banned Islamist tradition which saw its shady past during the Cold War. After their old party getting banned, they split from it as the ""reformists"" meaning they'd be cosy-cosy with the West and due to the economic crisis, old parties losing credibility and junta leftover election system, they came into power with 22% of whole eligible voters. They once claimed to be changed, declared themselves Muslim-democrats and be the darling of the US and the EU, opened some weird alliance with Kurdish nationalists and various economic liberals, rode the economic expansion by then and boosted its votes to 40%, and went on until the economic crisis hit Turkey in 2008-09. From that point on, they turned more authoritarian day by day and dismantled every possible power centre more or less. They are reactionary Islamists to religious conservatives but now with the leader obsession and such.

MHP: former fascist to proto-fascist, current ultra nationalist to proto fascist party. Infamous for their bloody past and was relatively small but a typical US and intel backed militant organisation of Cold War. Not ""that"" radical anymore. With Turkist-Islamist, Turanist and Turkist-secular factions. Acted like an ally of AKP for long years but denied it, for some years became official allies with the said party. Criticised for being literal puppies for Erdo. 

CHP: Founding party. It was a version of Jacobins in 1920s but evolved a lot since. Social democrat and Kemalist with all flavours. With staunchly la√Øcist, left wing nationalist and a bit more leftist factions. It's the main opposition party that is more than often accused of not being competent enough, and gets criticised by left wing voters for trying to appease to the centre right while secular centre right started to self identify with this party to the point of disliking their left wing cliques. Tries to appease the nationalist voters but gets failed everytime. Gets a substantial amount of its votes due to lacking an alternative. 

IYI: secular right wing. Literally a mix of a bit more centre portions of proto-fascist MHP and some of the former centre right. Staunchly anti-AKP and got to include the old secular centre right. 

HDP: Coming from the old mainstream Kurdish nationalist tradition. Due to tradition once being claiming to be socialist, once had such roots but now left-wing nationalist. Left-wing kurdish nationalist to inclusive leftyish in the West, Kurdish nationalist in the Kurdish majority regions that are rather conservative, and social democrat to liberal and/or socialist-ish in appeal for propaganda reasons (esp. towards the Western Europe). Once cosy cosy with AKP, now the scapegoat and the chip to libel any opposition with the accusation of ""working with the HDP"". 

SP: old-school Islamists. Anti-AKP. 

DEVA: AKP split-off. Formed by the old economic stabiliser and economic liberal and well educated (ivy league alumnis left and right) bunch of old AKP cadres.

GP: Old AKP PM and co. Populist, economic liberal and Islamist liberals.",An Adjar born in Tuscany,/r/europe/comments/oyozr9/aksoy_poll_parliamentary_elections_in_turkey/h7v0xki/,adjarteapot,1628200507

Heck, our country has less population than the state of New York and they are 10th in the standings, its pretty nuts. Contrary to previous years its not a lot from swimming (which most of the countries above us get a massive deal of medals from). 

Basically when 1 medal more or less makes a difference in position, its pretty interesting to look at. For the US its basically between the US and China (and perhaps Japan now). Not that interesting since you guys are miles ahead of the rest.

I think we're also the only country with a medal-counter on the side of the building in the Tokio Olympic Village and they celebrate whomever won a medal that day (outside).

To put it into terms that a boomer-brain might understand: young, woke people have perfect understanding of all knowledge. They know everything, and they're never wrong.

In case your tiny brain can't grasp the painfully obvious:

Jet ski man was trying to hinder fire-fighting operations on purpose because the fire is part of a cover-up to hide the truth about how Epstein didn't kill himself.

Jet ski man is actually a pilot in the shadow air force that shuttles around the hundreds of thousands of children that are used to satiate the carnal needs of the White Patriarchy and their never-ending lust for sacrificing children to Satan and eating their organs to attain longer lives.

What's being covered up in Turkey, for example, is a massive repair facility for the machines that dump the leftovers over the edge of our flat-disc earth.

The fires are started in a number of ways: high altitude focused radar, satellite weapons, 5G. But now they have the ability to ""activate"" unwilling agents who have taken the vaccine and live within 6 miles of the internet.

So, for example a group of armed aliens (foreign citizens), which enters a country by force and start  to shoot border guards, can't be expelled. In the case of armed invasion of Lithuania by Belarusian soldiers, Lithuanians can't forcibly expell them , because this invaders are foreign aliens, so their collective explusion is forbidden.

There is little financial education in this country (all 16 state education ministers are from the two aforementioned parties) because that could actually make people less dependant on the government for money. Private saving plans are discouraged (""Stock market = Casino"") and nowdays there's even plans for the introduction of a financial transaction tax which specifically targets small investors and excludes the actual financial industry. Thanks Giro-Olaf. So the young generation is forced to pay the ever rising pension for the old while being scammed out of a pension themselves. Plans for a stock market based pension system exist as an alibi at best. Oh and don't forget that tax euros to supplement (=keep from collapsing) the pension system are by now the biggest expense in the federal budget.

Climate change and environmental policy, digitalization, education, city planning, or basically anything that could be considered an investment in the future (or a catch up to the 21st century) is the same tragedy as our penion system.

Aside from the gerontocratic dominance, German angst and the nirvana paradox are also big hindrances for much needed change in this country. The average German wants a *perfect* alternative before even considering making a policy change - ""yeah the CDU/SPD isn't perfect but the others aren't better either"". I don't even ask for a good change, at this point I wish for any change at all so that there's any movement at all in german politics as opposed to the current standstill which we had for 16 years. Before that Schr√∂der at least did a minimum of necessary but unpopular changes. Before that we had another 16 years where Kohl first laid out the way to ruin the German welfare state by rushing the reunification (It shoulndn't have happened imo) and then going back to a complete political standstill.",Baden-W√ºrttemberg (Germany),/r/europe/comments/oymoks/i_expected_more_from_german_democracy_than_this/h7u1aap/,Key-Belt8796,1628185773

Most of the force probably came from the water resistance when the pilot let all the hull contact the water. During normal refilling operations only the scoops touch the water surface.

That's still impressive because it's way beyond the specification of the plane, which is supposed to take 665m to land on water.

5553,"&gt;You claimed a majority don't want Brexit posts. Again, please provide any evidence you have for this claim.

I did above, the only way you can prove if something is interesting and popular on reddit is by the popularity of the post. But I'll post it again below.

This brexit post, 6 upvotes, and most of the comments are you replying back to me about how everyone in r/europe is still massively interested in Brexit

Barring privately messaging the millions of redditors, you can judge interest directly by popularity. Like anything in life. Say a pilot tv show only gets 1000 viewers, that would be deemed as a lack of interest as the popularity wasnt there. Now a different show gets 2.4m viewers for the pilot. That shows there is interest in the show by its popularity.

Cant really get any clearer than that analogy, hopefully now it sinks in that this subreddit just isn't as interested in Brexit as it may have used to be say 2 years ago, and the majority have simply moved on. You will always get the die hard obsessed Brexit fans left, that cant breathe unless they read a brexit article on every subreddit. But luckily that's the massive minority, not the majority.

And I agree, with this last display of how interest
and popularity work on reddit. The case can be closed on the dwindling interest in Brexit articles in this subreddit.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/oydzni/brexit_red_tape_hits_uk_manufacturing_of_goods/h7u1sn4/,DynamoStranraer,1628185974

Okay, that's still not an argument in favor of the names being illegal. There's no reason a person can't have a last name for a first. And even so, some such names (e.g. Cooper and Fletcher) are already common first names. 

&gt;the child's right to a dignified name outweighs the parent's right to choose the documented name. In this case, the government is acting in the best interests of the child.

That's fair in fringe cases. I don't think it should be okay to name your kid Adolph Hitler or anything. But a lot of these are perfectly dignified names that are disallowed out of deference to some perceived royalty. That's a ridiculous and classist standard to have in a modern democracy.

5612,"&gt;Some EU rules are optional.

Yes..

&gt;Schengen access is not one of them.

I'm not sure what you are trying to say here, this isn't a Schengen level agreement, it is an agreement between the UK and 19 different EU members (and not all Schengen members either). It's not a Schengen visa.  Moreover, individual member states can and do set their own immigration policy for third countries, there is no requirement for that to be agreed at a Schengen or EU wide level.

&gt;For example this 2019 document already grants visa free access for short stays

That's an EU wide agreement, (so not Schengen) and was made with the consent of the member states based on the TOR's agreed by the member states. 

&gt;So they probably have granted reciprocity which is all what was asked originally by the EU.

Do you have a source that the EU was simply asking for reciprocity? That seems unlikely given if that had been the case, the UK would likely have agreed to it.  The issue is that all of the reporting around artists visas has been vague about both what was on offer and what the UK was being asked to do in return.  Indeed as you can see from your link above on the visa waiver, the UK seems to have been happy to agree reciprocal agreements that are like for like, in areas it doesn't have wider issues.",Ulster,/r/europe/comments/oy0rnf/uk_artists_can_now_tour_in_19_eu_countries/h7tjri5/,marsman,1628178564

No, just posting. Its tricky trying to keep up but you are nearly there. Nobody is interested in Brexit posts anymore so you'll never see me and many others post brexit articles to europe.

Not sure how else to word it even more monosyllabically to allow for comprehension. There are many in this subreddit not interested in Brexit anymore and are vocal about posts appearing about brexit. There are whole other subreddits for it, just post in there to your hearts content, leave this subreddit clear of the same old Brexit articles.

Hopefully that's got through, but I'm not too sure still. This looks to be beyond some in here.

5664,"\&gt; Firstly you presented yourself as the authority figure 

This is all in your head. I did the opposite of that. Someone appealing to their own authority just says ""You need to listen to me because I know this stuff"". I did present the reasoning, background information and additional links. How else would you present any kind of knowledge in a conversation.

If you have a problem with that, you just have a problem with someone knowing stuff better than you. There are a lot of people who went down that path. They are explaining to virus experts that they should try to use hydroxychloroquin and to astronomers that the moon landing never happened.

Please note that you talk in this conversation with much more confidence. In a lot of cases I write ""probably"", or ""as far as I understand"". In other cases I make clear that this goes into a topic where I don't have expert knowledge. You, on the other hand, say again and again that you KNOW I'm wrong. So even though I have way more specific knowledge I present myself with less autority than you.

\&gt; on a subject where you're clearly giving your opinion. 

In the same way a doctor presents an opinion when he tells you that eating a gallon of ice cream is unhealthy and backs that up with tests, experience, medical studies and so on. You might still categorize this as an opinion, but it is a very qualified one.

\&gt; You're ignoring what is being said 

I accused you of abandoning a subject every time you loose on it. I brought several examples to underpin this accusation. You, on the other hand, just write something like that without any further explanation what you even mean. At that point it looses any credibility, it's not a critique just incoherent stuff.

\&gt; You may be an expert in functional safety but you're not an expert in all things automotive nor are you qualified to be the authority on general engineering practices.

Correct, as I pointed out several times. It's even in the first sentence I wrote in this thread. This is why I only talked about functional safety the whole time. You are the one putting words in my mouth. 

\&gt; I'm also not interested in going point by point over each time you lay down a strawman.

Please do, at least one time. I hate using unfair discussion techniques. Right now, I believe you are just talking BS but if I really used a discussion technique like that, I want to change that. Unlike you, I care if the things I say make sense.

\&gt; Your examples of reasons you think functional safety is the most important thing and reflects on the entire engineering practices of a company badly

Never remotely said that. All in your head. Said the opposite a couple of times.

When someone points out a problem with the antenna in the new iPhone, do you also read this as ""Apple is bad and they do shit engineering""? This complete lack of ability to differentiate is baffling to me.

\&gt; 1 country in the world that would make these things laws 

There are laws. I think I already told you that about 100 times now. Do you even read anything I write? 

\&gt; LCD screens do not selectively stop displaying a few regions like the way you seem to think they can fail. 

[https://discussions.apple.com/content/attachment/a82b5889-78cc-4a99-b3db-e0800ab68d22](https://discussions.apple.com/content/attachment/a82b5889-78cc-4a99-b3db-e0800ab68d22)

\&gt; The software is tested by checking its in-memory render of the screen

That is a very good suggestion. There is just a problem. The function checking the screen can also have a bug and returns an ""OK"". You might argue that it is very unlikely that both functions fail (the displaying and the checking function) which is true. 

But ""unlikely"" has no meaning in functional safety until you can quantify it. And that is impossible when the functions are not free from possible interference. You need functions that run independently on different processors or on different cores that are free from possible interference (that's one reason you need specialized processors). But if the monitoring function needs to check the memory of the displaying function, than we have a problem with freedom of interference.

\&gt; Its literally tested millions of times for correct behavior before being put into production.

Doesn't help against HW defects or EMC. Doesn't help regarding problems that only occur when two special states happen at once. 

\&gt; when you finally listened to me about how they don't have LEDs in their dash

I listened to you ... and said you are wrong. What you call ""excuses"" is presenting a paper that clearly describes that you need those measures. 

\&gt; who are established in the industry get caught off guard and shown how antiquated they've become

That's cute. Functional safety is a pretty new field. It's importance is increasing extremely, expecially with automotive driving. The whole thing really took off with release of the ISO which was less than 10 years ago. Everyone is searching for experts right now. I have absolutely no worries. Also, I am originally a SW developer for automotive control units and plan to go back to that. Way less stress but also way less money. Also, I work on BEVs, the change in the industry benefits me a lot. So this is something I have to thank Tesla for. 

As I said, I talk the same way about any other OEM. Not regarding functional safety but other technologies. The only reason this is about Tesla, is that the main threat was about Tesla. For example, one of the big advantages of Tesla is that they can implement drastic changes in a very short time. I've read that they reduced the length of the cable harness by about 90% in model 3. This is madly impressive. There is no way they could even reduce it by 10% in the cars of my OEM. Not because of technical challenges but because of the company structure, which is fucking embarrassing. So if the topic would have been ""why have traditional OEMs a problem closing the gap to Tesla"", I would have criticized the trational OEMs in the same way. Just not with the same confidence, since I don't develop EMs, batteries, autonomous driving systems and so on. All fields where Tesla is either clearly above the competition or at least on the same level.

\&gt; You're screaming about how they're ignoring traditional rules

Traditional rules? Measures that prevent killing people. 

\&gt; The auto industry, and probably also many aspects of functional safety, have now changed forever.

Correct. I'm currently working on that change. They just didn't change the way you think and I'm pretty sure Tesla will either change a lot or will have a major scandal in the future.

\&gt; You railed on them for entertaining the idea of switching gears by touch screen. If it were a traditional car you would be right and I wouldn't say anything.

Great. So I have finally convinced you on one point, since Tesla offers ""Kriechen"". [https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/fahrbericht/tesla-model-s-heimlich-still-und-leise-richtung-zukunft/](https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/fahrbericht/tesla-model-s-heimlich-still-und-leise-richtung-zukunft/)

All the functions you describe in the Tesla are industry standard. Of course, an active Kriechfunktion is not the only reason for making the shifter safe. I don't know how many possible hazards there are but iirk it was about 50 that we defined and maybe 10% of them can be ignored when you get rid of Kriechen.

For example, it is dangerous if you think you are in D but switched to R instead (you stand on the break at a red light and the display registers an actuation because of humidity). Or if you switch to N (which doesn't need a break actuation) - now the breaks are not automatically applied since N is used for towing of the car wash. Suddenly the car can roll. 

Please realize that an ASIL-A shifter is about twice as expensive as a QM shifter. It's not like OEMs want to put money into this stuff, since no customer cares. We do this to comply with the law and to avoid possible scandals. We tried for a long time to get rid of those requirements for the shifter (not me personally but colleagues) in the same way you argue for it. But there was no way around it, we had to do it.

\&gt; Maybe you don't trust software

I am often the first guy who drives a new SW release of powertrain components. I often deactivate the safety measures and inject faults while driving. So personally I have no distrust, all this is not about a significant risk for a single person, but about a 0.0001% risk for millions of people.",,/r/europe/comments/ow95hi/best_selling_evs_in_europe_in_2021/h7tkxlb/,BrunoBraunbart,1628179048

What you claimed, and then doubled down on with your ""this argument is still true because I say so"" was that neoliberalism ""burns up all resources, skyrockets inequalities and polarizes society"" in the mid to long-term. Neoliberalist ideas are very recent and haven't been practiced ""in the mid to long-term"". Your claim is pure nonsense. Not that I would agree with your assessment in the short term either, but that's besides the point. Even then your original comment is utter nonsense because the claimed effects and time frame doesn't match at all.

If me being slightly worse off today than my richest neighbour allows for 10 people of the future to live a similar life as I did instead of inhumane poverty, I am more than happy.  
  
I don't care for labels of the systems, the thing that matters the most is to maximize world progress without inducing severe terror and misfortune in the process.

Strange that millions of men dying is only a tragedy then and the countless deaths to forge the British Empire were ok with you.

And in your opinio, it would have been better to bankrupt yourself by loosing all trading partners because fascists took over Europe instead? 

In WWI, Britain would have been dragged in eventually anyway. Germany Germany very specifically wanted ‚Äúits place in the sun‚Äù. Hard to do when there‚Äôs an Empire on which the Sun never Sets.

Even if Britain somehow avoided any interference in Europe

Also isn‚Äôt it a bit hypocritical to decry the communist takeover of Eastern Europe when you were also complaining about how Britain shouldn‚Äôt defend other nations? 

You are very good at making emotional sound bites but you need to actually support your arguments. 

What precisely leads you to believe Britain would be better off of if they stayed out of the war and lost any influence in designing the post war world.

&gt; Then how do you explain the inexorable decline since 1945? Empire gone, industry gone, technology leads gone, religion gone, all sense of community gone, entire towns lost to migrant communities.

Your gonna have to pick one. You can either have an empire, which means getting involved to defend that empire and British men dying on its defense, or no empire which means not whining about not having one.

Not true. Sweden was definitely a much more developed a country and it shows when you actually study the period. Even by studying the townscapes of Estonia and Sweden at that time tells you immediately that we were the poor backwater compared to them. Finland, yes, was not very rich at that time, but nevertheless they were the country that supported our independence first, not the other way around. Finland had had autonomy and self-government for a long time and it showed.

&gt;Perhaps I'm a bit biased, but I don't think any other countries were as doomed during WW2 than the Baltics.

I think you mean the Soviet Union damaged the countries a lot. WWII in itself was destructive in a lot of places.

And in pubs it's also almost always cheaper.  
I've only seen Guinness with a price that high and that's almost 0,5l.
