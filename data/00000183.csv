4,"I think this is true. The logic behind traditional forest industry is that they are making products that have higher value added than biofuels. To but it simbly this means that in normal market were everyone pays the same for the raw material paper, cardboard and stuff like furniture are more feasible option to produce. 

Now the main way to get wood materials to be used for biofuels is to give some sort of substity or other bonus to those that make the biofuels. This means that goverment starts to pay for the companies to make lower value products.

This is the opposite of reality. The vast majority of Farmers in Africa have low productivity because they're subsidence farmers who have no tractors or equipment. Displacing them and replacing their land with actual modern farming is what multiplies productivity. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look at fucking Zimbabwe. They kicked out all the white farmers and gave their land to local black people, That cause food production to collapse and created all the food insecurity. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue here is money. Africans need industry and industrialization so that they can get normal jobs. The fact that like 50% of Africans work as farmers is exactly the problem.

But these standards are the same for European companies, so it's not protectionism. Also it has stricter laws against things like monopolies, but again that is not protectionism since it is the same for every company regardless of origin. 

The US meanwhile might have a very open internal market (lax anti-monopoly laws and regulations) but it is actually highly protectionist against foreign companies. 

Every credible source I've found says that the US is more protectionist than the EU, so feel free to post your information since I couldn't find any supporting your claim.

198,"&gt;How will Ireland do this without putting a border in place?

There is a border now between the UK and Ireland, just not a customs border. 

When the UK leaves the EU there will still be a border, and it'll be an external EU border (but not a Schengen border..). 

If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement there will have to be a customs border (note that the UK and Ireland have a common travel area cooperate on visas, and Ireland isn't in Schengen, so people crossing the border broadly isn't an issue..). That means that there will be different customs rules on each side.

These are all different types of border, none of them require a specific implementation or a specific approach, as long as they do what they are supposed to do. Now if your argument is that Ireland and the UK can't enforce customs rules, on an Island, with good cross border cooperation, using off-border management of customs then fair enough, but I'm willing to bet Ireland will try given the alternative is the one thing that Ireland has said it will absolutely not accept, that the UK has said it will not do and that the EU has said it wants to avoid.

But which ones? 

That's the problem with the solution. 

It's 2007 and the European Steve Jobs asks Europe for help with this idea he has for a consumer friendly smartphone. Do the government administrators care that supporting the ePhone will kill Nokia's mobile business and cause a lot of job losses?

And then Geugle comes and wants to develop an Endroid OS to finish off Nokia and also take business away from the recently funded ePhone - do they also get support?

Successful companies often disrupt existing companies, which is why it's politically impossible for governments to play the role of kingmakers or VCs. MS overtook IBM; the IBM pc overthrew the Apple II (the bestselling PC in the late 70's through 1981 or so); the clones overthrew the IBM PC, etc.

If the government takes too active a role, existing companies are going to (reasonably) ask why the EU is trying to put them out of business by funding a competitor. ",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/atjlyq/top_15_best_global_brands_ranking_20002018/eh2hn3q/,thewimsey,1550880511

A young teacher in grade 2 class decides to open the window as the day is warm and the classroom is becoming a bit stuffy. Walking towards the window he thinks he hears a kid's voice:

- don't open that window or I'll beat the shit out of you

""This is impossible, grade 2"" - he thinks and continues towards the window.

- ""don't open that window or I'll beat the shit out of you"", the little voice goes again and the teacher turns around and sees a small, cute blonde boy with his fists clenched


Being a new teacher and not very experienced as to how to react, and what punishment to apply, he heads straight to the principal's office where he describes the events of the last few minutes.


- ""about 120 cm tall?"" asks the principal
- ""Yes""
- ""Blonde hair""?

&gt;The dead of Bloody Sunday and ballymurphy may havce been Irish, but they were BRITISH citizens killed by BRITISH soldiers. This is a fact.

And it’s also a fact that for decades Irish nationalists indiscriminately murdered thousands of British civilians with horrible things like nail bombs and mortar. Whatever sin British troops committed on Bloody Sunday it as cleansed by the vileness of the nationalists campaign.


&gt;British intelligence DID try to have the Prime Minister of Ireland assasinated by a paramilitary organisation. This is also a fact.

​No it isn’t at all. It’s based on a single claim from a single source that is completely usubstantiated. The fact that you are trying to demand that this acceptable as fact probably relates to the actual Irish nationalist campaign to murder the British prime minister.

One of the posters you above tried to the same thing to assert the British wanted to shoot up schools based on the same incredibly thin claim by an anonymous sources. But was as assertive in that claim as you, but again it was complete bullshit. Again I think it’s some sort of coping mechanism to try and wash away guilt of what Irish nationalists did.

&gt;Your country did bad things, just accept it.

And that’s is the crux of it isn’t it? You need these tiny thin pieces of evidence to be true because you need Britain to be the bad guy. Because you don’t want to accept that in this Irish nationalists were the force for evil.

Still no excuse though, we have tons of surface areas on flat roofed office buildings that could be used for solar. Quite a bit of wind power is being installed in the north sea (5GW between now and 2024, another 4.7GW in 2027). Total installed power at the moment is 18GW including renewables so by then at least a good chunk of electricity should be renewable.

630,"&gt;Pretty sure that the majority of the people living on the land that was partitioned weren't Israeli. They were Arabs and they rejected the whole idea of the partition. Just like you said - according to your own arguments - the establishment of Israel was racist itself.

The majority of the people living in the entire region of Palestine, were indeed Arabs. But in the area assigned to the Israeli state under the Partition Plan, the vast majority were Jewish. And in the area assigned to an Arab state, the vast majority were Arabs. The Partition Plan wasn't so much of a viable partition of lands between two completely functional states, as much as it was a partitioning of the two core populations of the region into districts in which only they reside.

The Partitioning isn't racist. It had to be done because the two core populations could not live under one state, and the British were leaving.

The Arab population also wasn't the sovereign, nor was the entire region their land to decide its fate. They did not even have a proper government that would unify them into one nation, and they would not become a nation until the 1970's.

The inhabitants would decide the future of the region, and of themselves. The Israeli population chose statehood. The Arab population chose to reject statehood and was almost immediately assimilated by Jordan and Egypt.

How you can say Israel's existence is racist, is beyond me. Unless you're willing to call the existence of Palestine also racist.

&gt; The plan was rejected by the majority of those living there. Self determination, remember? Weird how that goes out the window in your argument. 

To the very contrary, mr. buffoon. I took into account the right to self determination from the very beginning. Both Israel and Palestine fulfilled their right to self determination by voting in the Partition Plan. Israel voted for, Palestine voted against.

And please explain to whom are you referring when you say ""those living there"". If you mean Israel, then that's irrelevant because its government voted for the resolution.

If you mean Palestine, then that's irrelevant because its government voted against the resolution. Both voted. Both fulfilled their right to self determination.

&gt; Oh it could be seen as racist to deny people their right to self determination. It could be. A second ago that was treating them as subhumans. Now it is sometimes okay to do that? Hmm - weird how once again your argument flip flops. Weird but typical. 

Being racist towards people IS treating them as subhumans. You're saying that being racist is okay?

I don't know about you, but in my culture being racist is not considered okay.

&gt; 'oh guys here is an excuse who denying the right to self determination of Arabs is okay, but when you do it to Jews you are treating them as subhumans' 

Definition of borders has nothing to do with the right to self determination. You are shifting goalposts, a common strategy for those of lower intellect.

In fact, Israel's lack of definition of borders greatly aids Palestine in fulfilling its right to self determination.

&gt; The fact is that racist Israel is denying the right of the Palestinian people to their own state.  

To the contrary. Israel offered the Palestinians statehood many times over the decades. The Palestinians chose willingly to reject statehood. 

But why would you blame Israel for racism, if you claimed in the same comment that racism is okay?

&gt; The creation of Israel was a rejection of the right of self determination of the majority living there.  

To the contrary. The creation of Israel was the result of the democratic vote of the Jewish people and Arab people to either accept or reject statehood. 

The right of self determination is not fulfilled only when a nation votes FOR statehood. Even voting against statehood is the fulfillment of that right. I suggest you read the dictionary definition, or a Wikipedia article, on the right to self determination. You'll see that any decision to either become sovereign, partially autonomous, or fully assimilated within another people, are the fulfillment of that right.

The majority of Israelis wanted statehood. The Israeli leadership was democratic. The decision was democratic, and a fulfillment of that right.

&gt; If you believe in democracy or things like human rights - truly believe in them and not some bullshit belief that you're willing to make excuses for - then you are against Israel in every way. 

To the contrary, ignoramus. I love democracy, and I am in favor of upholding human rights that aren't even relevant to me. Israel, as a democratic country and liberal society, is an embodiment of that. A flaw exists in every western society, but that is not enough to rule out democracy altogether.

&gt; This is the vast majority to you?

&gt; Weird to see you defend racism 

You literally just said racism is okay.

&gt; this 'Jewish supremacy' ideal that you have where denying the rights of Jewish people is treating them as subhumans 

Are you even hearing yourself? So denying the right of Jewish people to self determination is NOT treating them as subhuman?

Nice way to accuse me of ""Judaism"" by the way. Not very effective, as I'm an atheist.

&gt; but doing the same to Palestinians is a matter for negotiation. 

No. The very existence of negotiations is not for their right to self determination. It is the FULFILLMENT of their right to self determination.

730,"&gt;Nothing to do with citizenship which is what the argument about the girl (and others) is about. You are not arguing for extradition treaties with Syria or Iraq, you're arguing that any country that finds these British nationals should be saddled with them, whether they want it or not. Your position is inherently contradictory as you're simply looking for an excuse for these countries not to be responsible at all for the citizens they exported around the world.

I'm still trying to figure out where you and others have got this idea that because this woman is a British citizen she is Britain's responsibility?

This ""rule"" does not apply anywhere else in the world. 

Lets look at her crimes for a minute.

* She committed crimes against the Syrian State not the United Kingdom.

* She flew to Turkey (not illegal albeit she did it with her sister's passport) the illegal part was her smuggling herself into Syria illegally that's crime number 1.

* Crime Number 2 - She joined the Islamic State in Syria this is grounds for the death penalty under Syrian law. 

* Crime Number 3 - She abetted the Islamic state. 

* Crime number 4 - Terrorism this may or may not be applicable to her. I believe this may be subjective to the judge in question. As he/she may charge her with terrorism by association simply for supporting and enabling ISIS. Which also carries the death penalty.

And there are more crimes which do not carry the death penalty but life imprisonment. 

Now lets get to the point of why she is Syria's problem and not England's.

* She willingly betrayed England by all means she renounced her own citizenship by joining an organization that vowed to destroy the UK among other nations as well. 

* She willingly chose to join the Islamic State. Nothing was coerced whatsoever. It was all her own choice and therefore her actions ought to have consequences. 

* In no way is Britain obligated to repatriate her to Britain to face trial. It would be perfectly legal for Britain to allow Syria to prosecute her for her crimes in Syria. It would actually be very good for Britain's foreign relations with the Syrian Government to not interfere in Syrian jurisdiction and thus not infringe on Syria's sovereignty and sovereign right to prosecute ISIS within its own territory regardless of their foreign citizenship. 

An example of this would be the Yang Fenglan a Chinese citizen arrested prosecuted and incarcerated by Tanzania. China gave Tanzania the green light. Despite her actions not being illegal in China til last year where they finally decided to crack down on ivory smuggling. China believes their citizen Yang Fenglan ought to justice in the country she committed the crime in and that's what has happened. Good on China for doing this as it allows Tanzania to get some justice. If China were to repatriate her then Tanzania would have lost their right to prosecute a criminal that committed heinous crimes in their own country all because this criminal has the privilege of Chinese citizenship.

Another example to look at is Linda Wenzel a German national that has been prosecuted in Iraq for crimes against the state of Iraq much like Shamima Begum's crimes against the state of Syria. 

Germany tried to repatriate her against the wishes of the Iraqi government but failed. They did manage to prevent her swift execution though as the Iraqi government sought out the death penalty for Linda. This was a violation on Germany's part. As the Germans believe that their jurisdiction overrides Iraq's her being a citizen of Germany should not mean Germany can choose to repatriate her to evade justice for her crimes against Syria. That is a perversion of justice and clearly a violation of Iraq's sovereignty.

Influence is not relevant when we are talking about borders in physical geography.

Turkey is an example of that influence. I mentioned russia because the russian hearth lies within europe. Thats why russia is considered as an european country while infact its a transcontinental country.

Kazakhstan - transcontinental country, but opposite of russia, everything happes in asia, therefore we speak about it as an asian country.

Turkey - transcontinetal country, with influence in europe, however the country it self lies within asia, was oriented in history towards asia (yes balkan ofc, nothing big conpared to the rest of the otttoman empire).

Note aside, maybe offtopic, turkey doesnt want to be part of the europe as in part of the eu. Theres no reason to consider turkey as an european country, however few turks are european as they live on the balkan.

Id recommend visiting a geography course on your uni that covers this topic if you have the chance. (Lectures are public in my country, dunno if you have a similiar option or you study and can visit such course).

You are mistaken if you think that the reasons nationalism in india or china are the same as those in europe or america.

&gt;Hindu nationalism is rising in India under the BJP, and Chinese nationalism is rising despite being a far-left communist country.

Im not aware that India has ever not had a nationalistic or proto fascist government. 

China is not a far left country. At least not since private proprrty is allowed and corporations and rampant private schools, hospitals and so on, are a thing there.

Their nationalism is founded upon national pride and their so called ""century of shane"".

They are eager to get back at the west.

855,"The only party opposed to Stuttgart 21 were the Greens. They more than doubled their seats in the 2011 Landtag election compared to the one from 2006, because of their opposition to it. Because of their law proposal (as governing party), there was a referendum in 2011 in the first place. The position they campaigned for did not come out victorious in this referendum, although it was tight (41% voted against Stuttgart21); considering that all other parties (representing over 75% of the seats in the Landtag) were against it.

It is important to note that the referendum was *Land*wide; not only the citizens of Stuttgart were polled, but those of all of Baden-Württemberg. In Stuttgart, 47,1% of the valid, cast votes was against Stuttgart 21.

Although opposition to the project is no long being championed by any political party, this is more due to an acceptance of realistic facts by a mature green party that has become a mature *Volkspartei* rather than an attachment to its convictions; protests against the project still remain strong. At the same time, [public opinion on the topic keeps changing](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_gegen_Stuttgart_21#Meinungsumfragen).

Clearly their CEO is just amazingly bad at managing PR.

within a nation, among their own kind, with their own language, schools and institutions, and even their
own government. Contacts with Poles (Christians) would be kept to a minimum, mainly on the economic
plane. However, in addition to exclusivist schools for the Jewish community which were to be funded by
the state, Jews wanted to have it both ways: they also demanded full access to Polish schools as a vehicle
for their own social advancement. (While such separateness or autonomy was championed for Jews and
other minorities, those Poles who espoused similar aspirations for themselves were branded as anti-Semites
and xenophobes.)""

1054,"&gt; I personally agree with what more than 95% of all the criminal law professors in Spain have said

You should make up your mind about the percentage. Last time you said it was 99%

This reminds me of that anecdote with the publication of the book ""100 authors against Einstein"" to which Einstein famously replied ""If I were wrong, one would have been enough"". I am tempted to use the same quote here, but law is not physics and I perfectly understand that there may be different interpretations of the law.  There is a technical discussion to be had about whether the court's decission is correct or not. It could perfectly be the case that it is not correct and the accused should not have been put in pre-trial prison, however, that is not what you are saying.

When you affirm that the decission of the court is politically motivated and the Catalan leaders are political prisoners, you are explicitly take the discussion out of the technical scope where it belongs. **What you are doing is accusing the court of perverting the course of justice**, which is a very serious accusation and it is NOT what those experts are saying.

&gt; You just have to see how no European court (UK, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland) wanted to accept the vision of the Spanish Judiciary.

Those courts have also explicitly rejected the claim of political prosecution, but you convenientely leave that out since it directly undermines your position.

This is what [the resolution of the German court about Puigdemont](http://cadenaser00.epimg.net/descargables/2018/04/12/6c150c62e62a5d27f3d85a70cf2de13d.pdf) had to say about the accusation of political prosecution:

&gt; No hay indicios de que, en caso de extradición, la Persona reclamada (tal como
afirma la asistencia legal) pudiera estar expuesta al peligro de persecución política
en el sentido del art. 6, apdo. 2 de la IRG, es decir, que el Reino de España pudiera
enjuiciar a la Persona reclamada únicamente con el pretexto de sus convicciones
políticas por actos no cometidos realmente por ella. Con la malversación de fondos
públicos, se acusa a la Persona reclamada de actos concretos punibles, también con
arreglo al derecho alemán, y no por sus convicciones políticas, que al parecer fueron
el motivo de los actos, si los hubiera cometido.

Yes, but not dramatically different... GPS-collar batteries last &lt;3 years if they stay on. The GPS-collars have a higher failure rate due to their size and complexity. It's more likely that they used radio collars, but these have no ""live""-feed (although GPS-collars aren't really live feed either). They have to send out helicopters to find them.

&gt; Also there are more factors in play in Finland than just lack of fear. It’s lack of prey and open space that is driving wolves closer to our homes. The population is getting too big, but good luck trying to get Greens to understand that.

I'd argue that it's not a lack of prey, but an over-abundance of prey near populations centers (e.g. roe deer). Roe deer have spread so much now that hunters can't control the population properly. Add to that hybrid wolves that are suspected to make up a significant portion of Finnish wolves - these are the most unstable due to cross-breeding with dogs.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/at71x8/estonian_workmen_brought_a_wolf_to_a_vet_today/eh0nksi/,shoot_dig_hush,1550823427

1100,"&gt; I can't speak about the rest but Amnesty International defended ETA terrorists so their opinion in Spain is worth about 0.

This is like saying that the European Court of Human Rights defended ETA terrorists so their opinion in Spain is worth about 0, because the Court recently condemned Spain for not giving a fair trial to an ETA member: [European rights court faults Spain over 'biased' 2010 ETA case](https://www.thelocal.es/20181107/european-rights-court-faults-spain-over-biased-2010-eta-case)

Nobody is supporting ETA actions here. But everybody deserves a fair trial, even ETA terrorists. And Spain hasn't ensured this many times, even commiting serious abuses like killing innocence people: *GAL (paramilitary group) were death squads established illegally by officials of the Spanish government to fight ETA*. 


&gt; I can understand wanting them out of jail, that's ok but they broke the law 

I can tell right away that you don't know about Spanish criminal law. There's a reason why every single Spanish Criminal Law professor has said they shouldn't be in jail. It's not about wanting or not wanting someone in jail, but about applying and respecting the law. Even though this might seem so weird for you.

I'm going to give you a quick lesson. The sentence ""when you break the law you go to jail"" is wrong, thankfully. In most cases, when you break the law, that won't be a criminal offense, since Criminal Law is ruled by *ultima ratio* principle. So you'll be free of any responsibility (for instance if you cross the street in red when walking). In other cases you'll have to pay a fine or whatever administrative law regulation. The action will only be a criminal offense if the criminal law says so (Penal Code). But then again, in most cases you still won't go to jail. There are many kinds of punishments established, and prison is reserved for the more serious crimes.

The Catalan leaders case is about pre-trial detention, not a punishment but a precautionary measure. And as all Spanish criminal law professors have said, it's been applied terribly wrong by the judges. No Catalan leader should have been in pre-trial detention.

Most European city-dwellers do not in fact drive, and those peoples' commutes aren't considered in how ""congested"" the city is. Similarly for İstanbul, 50% of trips are by walking, \~35% by transit, and a measly 15% by car - which still makes us have the 32nd longest time spent in car congestion in the world.

Also the referendum at the very least will have to have 3 options:

1. Remain in the EU.
2. May's Brexit Deal
3. No deal.

If you exclude 1, the supporters of it will protest. So with 3 options on the ballot a second referendum is just going to cause more chaos.

And lastly, all of this, Brexit and all the crap around it was never an issue that should have been put on a referendum vote.

1186,"Apart from the fact that the picture doesn't seem to include THAT many people (I've seen separatist demonstrations with many more), yesterday was defined by an attempt to arrange a general strike which, to all means and extents, has failed.

Catalan newspaper:

https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20190221/huelga-general-catalunya-cataluna-21-febrero-2019-ultimas-noticias-directo-7314022

It's true that in Girona it's been more ""massive"" with 70.000 people by official estimation. Separatism is much more prevalent in poorer, more rural areas of Catalonia. 

In Barcelona, the same official estimations show that around 40.000 people took the streets yesterday, which is less than impressive.

Even separatists are considering the strike a failure. Commerce and schools were not paralyzed and the only incidents worth mentioning seemed to be the usual trash containers burned down by the usual hooded antifa, and a couple dozen tractors blockading a road in Girona for a few hours.

A recurring joke which perhaps not all of you know, is that among the Catalan provinces (4 of them), only Barcelona is a net contributor to the system: the other three are just as much in need of external help and ""system solidarity"" as the Andalusian provinces they like to look down their noses.

The very same separatist leaders cry about (Spain redistributing wealth among territories) is EXACTLY the same thing separatist leaders do to Barcelona within Catalonia. And to a BIGGER extent (bigger percentage of ""redistribution"". 

There are tongue-in-cheek separatist movements WITHIN Catalonia, on the verge of becoming real someday, which aim at separating ""rich Barcelona and part of Tarragona"" (the richest and less separatists areas) from the separatist, rural and subsidized areas.

1203,"&gt;What I think is a big factor, is that Danish people generally live in large houses by European standards. Denmark has the second largest average house size, after Luxembourg. And houses are regarded as wealth. So if people in a country in general spend more of their income on housing, rather than on other consumption, they will end up with more wealth.

I'm sorry, but this logic is utterly absurd. 

Larger houses are a *result* of wealth, not a point of creation... How exactly do you think the size of a house has any direct effect on one's ability to generate wealth? 

The fact you think something that *only* ended in 1857 has less of an affect than house size is... peculiar. 

Ignoring the fact that houses cost money, not create it. The other reason I know you're wrong is because do you know who's bottom of the house size chart in Europe? The UK. Yet we're the second largest European economy. We're where we are because we're one of the oldest European histories that has had a continuous history for near on a millennium now who, like Denmark, have had an extremely advantageous geographical position in terms of economic and strategic importance, and like Denmark, we've capitalised on it for hundreds of years.

1227,"&gt; Capital punishment has never been something conducted outright. It's always been a punishment conducted in response for specific crimes not all crimes.

You missed the point. You are unwilling to defend capital punishment on its own merit, for the legal system in any country but you unequivocally assert that it is right and moral regardless.

&gt; Everything to do with criminal jurisdiction. Iraq and Syria are sovereign nations. These ISIS individuals committed crimes in those two countries. Anyone that understands common sense will understand where these individuals should face trial and imprisonment where they committed the crimes regardless of their European citizenship.

However, they didn't say just ""no"". You linked to the whole transcript yourself and there is a lengthy debate. (68 pages)

 I'd highlight the words of Rubalcaba (PSOE) who questions the non-binding nature of the referendum and argues that it is in fact politically binding as the words of the previous nationalist speaker reflects (he had said it was a no-return point, while also claiming it was a mere inquiry and not a binding referendum). He argues why it's not possible to transfer the competence to declare a referendum to the Catalan government as they were asking, and it's because that competence doesn't exist, a referendum can't be held locally when it deals with matters that affect the sovereignty of the entire country. It would be inconstitutional for anyone to do so. 

He also does a critique of the Constitution itself and argues it should be reformed when it limits the aspirations of self government of communities. He agrees that it's fair to want greater autonomy and compares its model to similar models in federal countries. He makes the case for a federal model, and proposes a reform that could turn Spain into a federation of states as a solution to the issue.

1303,"Smart immigration policies for sure. This is crucial. I’m sure the immigration problem won’t be blown out of proportion if immigration was handled properly and competently. No one would reject honest, qualified, hard working immigrants 

Also, it is necessary to incentivise higher birth rates in Europe and make it easier to start a family - at the moment it’s impossible to provide decent living conditions for a child (not to mention two or three) with one income. Both parents need to work to be able to live comfortably and many women are stuck in the dilemma between career or children. Being a mother needs to be incentivised so that women have the freedom to choose. It ties into, but is not related to immigration. And such policies are progressive, not xenophobic. It’s a big problem for western society and a ticking time bomb. Simply hauling in a ton of immigrants is not the solution, although it can help if it’s in addition to more robust, long term planning. The problem is that things will go for the worse exponentially - there will be more pensioners (who will also live longer due to quality of life improvements) and simultaneously fewer taxpayers because not enough babies would have been born in the meantime. A bit of immigration is excellent but a lot of immigration is trouble and you don’t want to create such friction in your society because it has never ended well...

1333,"&gt;Poland became more tolerant just as the Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, as well as from Austria, Hungary and Germany, thus stimulating Jewish immigration to the much more accessible Poland. Indeed, with the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, Poland became the recognized haven for exiles from Western Europe; and the resulting accession to the ranks of Polish Jewry made it the cultural and spiritual center of the Jewish people.

&gt;The most prosperous period for Polish Jews began following this new influx of Jews with the reign of Sigismund I the Old (1506–1548), who protected the Jews in his realm. His son, Sigismund II Augustus (1548–1572), mainly followed in the tolerant policy of his father and also granted autonomy to the Jews in the matter of communal administration and laid the foundation for the power of the Qahal, or autonomous Jewish community. This period led to the creation of a proverb about Poland being a ""heaven for the Jews"". According to some sources, about three-quarters of all Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century",Poland,/r/europe/comments/at764y/jewish_population_in_europe_in_1933/eh01lo8/,Szudar,1550801491

1337,"There's a difference between anti-zionism and just not being a zionist.

If you're not a Jewish person, or in any way related to Israel, it's completely logical that you would not be Zionist, much in the same way you won't expect a French person to be an Italian nationalist.

However being anti-Zionist is a bit different. It's the rejection of the basic principle of Zionism - the right for self determination of the Jewish people.

Zionism in its name refers to today's Israel, but at times other alternatives were considered by the movement. And many different variants of Zionism were formed. Some were religious, some were secular. Some were communist, some were capitalistic. Some believe Zionism has fulfilled its goals and no longer exists, while some believe Zionism is the improvement of the current Israel.

The right for self determination also happens to be a basic human right. If you deny a people that right, you are effectively treating them as sub-humans. That is racism. In the specific case of Jews, that form of racism is antisemitism. 

So being anti-Zionist, thus rejecting the right to self determination for Jews, is antisemitic.

If you believe Jews should have a homeland of their own, or should have the ability to make that choice, then you're not anti-Zionist. You're just not a Zionist and that's it.",,/r/europe/comments/at0hkk/macron_says_france_will_define_antizionism_as/eh01tul/,Mighty_Zuk,1550801665

There is no guarantee of either of those things.

Also now that they are out of one union it makes even less sense to leave another

&gt;Scotland will apply for EU membership and get it.

Scotland can apply but getting it is another matter. It takes years to be approved after going through many hoops and the EU commissioner has already told Nicola Sturgeon that Scotland will not be granted automatic membership if they become independent despite being apart of it now. There are many factors that need to be looked at before being approved as well as the unsettled currency debate. If Scotland adopted the Euro how would that affect trade with the UK because they would still be using the pound. Not to mention the biggest reason Scotland will never get into the EU as an independent country, Spain. They have flat out stated that they will deny any attempt from Scotland to join the EU. This would be a deal-braker as every EU member has to approve the entry of a new country to be let in. Spain will never change their position because they think it would give support to the Catalonian independence movement.

1418,"&gt; Huawei's main rivals are Nokia and Ericsson- both European companies. It's weird to me that you're letting spite determine whether the CCP controls vital infrastructure.

This isn't about the infrastructure, let alone security concerns. *Huawei* underwent more scrutiny by Western government agencies than any Western telecom giant ever did. So far, nobody has found anything beside the fact that the Chinese produce code which is as bad and as sloppy as Western equivalents. No surprises there. 

The real question is: Why is Huawei so far ahead in the race? Nokia and Ericsson both have the relevant patents and the technology, yet lack the mass production capabilities and thus the economies of scale the Chinese can muster. American companies have the mass production capabilities, but lack the relevant patents because they blew their money on stock buybacks, takeovers and other useless shit you do once you're the leader of the *status quo*, instead of investing in R&amp;D (that's the famous 'curse of success'). 

Only Huawei has it both: The patents *and* the economies of scale.

So what this all really boils down to is a pretty transparent attempt of the US administration to buy American telecom giants more time to catch up in the race, at the expense of both Chinese and European competitors. Security concerns are irrelevant, they're just the fig leaf to make it happen. 

Please also note that infrastructure isn't the real deal. While selling communication equipment is hugely profitable, at least for a time, the real profit centres are what's built on top of it. Cisco is profitable, but doesn't make anywhere near as much as Google, Facebook or Apple.

1425,"Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz visited President Trump in the White House on Wednesday. Some European commentators call Kurz, 32, “the friendly face of populism,” while the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, has labeled him “a rock star” among European conservatives. But others worry about his alliance with the pro-Russian Freedom Party. Kurz shares one thing with Trump: He came to office warning of the dangers he says are posed by immigration. After his White House meeting, Kurz sat down with The Washington Post’s Lally Weymouth. Edited excerpts follow:

Q: You met President Trump earlier today. How did it go?

A: We have different approaches on many issues, but the main topic for us today was the trade relationship between the U.S. and the European Union. Austria is a very export-oriented country. Our second-biggest trading partner is the U.S. I hope that it will be possible to reach a deal between the E.U. and the United States to guarantee economic growth for the U.S. and also for Europe. Uncertainty or a negative development like a trade war would be bad for both sides.

Q: Doesn’t President Trump see the E.U. as a competitor?

A: In some areas, he definitely does. But I think that fair, free trade is in the interest of both sides. Many European and Austrian companies invest in the U.S. and create jobs.

Q: Where do you see things differently from President Trump?

A: There are issues like climate change. We think that we have to do something about climate change because we have to protect our environment.

Q: Are there other issues on which you disagree with President Trump?

A: On [Nord Stream 2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/new-eu-measures-threaten-to-complicate-nord-stream-pipeline/2019/02/08/7c145e9e-2bbb-11e9-906e-9d55b6451eb4_story.html) [an underwater gas pipeline that runs between Russia and Germany, bypassing Ukraine], we have different positions. But there are also areas where we think that the U.S. is doing a good job. We are thankful for what the U.S. is doing in Korea — nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula is in the interest of all of us.

Q: When you became chancellor, many wondered why you went into a coalition with the right-wing [Freedom Party](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/austrian-election-yields-a-hard-right-turn-as-conservative-and-nationalist-parties-gain/2017/10/15/d1dce850-ad22-11e7-9b93-b97043e57a22_story.html), known to be pro-Russian and anti-Semitic.

A: There was no other opportunity. We have a system where you need to build coalitions to have a majority in parliament. The Social Democrats decided not to build a coalition with my party in which they were not in the lead. But we won the elections, so it was our right to lead the government. There was only one opportunity left, and that was the Freedom Party. Secondly, the Freedom Party supported our goals to make the necessary reforms to make the country economically more competitive.

Q: Why did you give the Freedom Party so many ministries — Defense, Interior, the Foreign Ministry and control over the intelligence services?

A: I think you have a very American view on this issue. In Austria, the minister for defense is [also responsible for sports](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/at-bmlv.htm). We are not a superpower like the U.S. We are a small and neutral country. I would say that other ministries, like the Ministry for Finance — which you did not mention — are much more important.

Q: Which your party kept?

A: We took that. We have 14 ministries, and in eight, we [the Austrian People’s Party], as the bigger party, are in the lead. In six, our coalition partner [the Freedom Party] is in the lead.

Q: The Freedom Party’s background is troubling, and the [Israeli government does not speak to its members](https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/.premium-the-austrian-embrace-how-kurz-s-far-right-government-is-wooing-israel-1.6637601) because of their background and their responsibility for many anti-Semitic incidents. Yet you’re very pro-Israel. How does this work?

A: On Israel, our position is very clear, and our coalition partner supports us on that: We are very pro-Israel. We are also trying to fight successfully in the European Union against anti-Semitism. Because of Austria’s history, it is, from my point of view, our obligation to do that.

[[How to tell when criticism of Israel is actually anti-Semitism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/how-to-tell-when-criticism-of-israel-is-actually-anti-semitism/2018/05/17/cb58bf10-59eb-11e8-b656-a5f8c2a9295d_story.html?utm_term=.b1db971c08f8)]

Q: You rose to office [supporting a tougher immigration policy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/as-merkel-teeters-austrias-kurz-seizes-the-moment-as-europes-rock-star-of-the-new-right/2018/06/26/b2560c2c-732f-11e8-bda1-18e53a448a14_story.html?utm_term=.eecdda2c43c9). Do you regard German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to open Germany’s borders to refugees in 2015 as a mistake?

A: My position was always clear on these issues. We are not against immigration, but we want to have control on immigration. We want to decide who is allowed to come into Austria. We should not let human traffickers decide.

That’s the reason why in 2015, when many heads of state — not only Merkel, but others — were in favor of opening the borders, I criticized this policy and said the problem will get bigger and more people will start to come. Worse than that, many people will lose their lives in the Mediterranean Sea on their way to Europe. It took a lot of time, but the position in Europe has changed. Now my position is supported by most European leaders, and Europe has started to protect its external borders. We managed to reduce the flow of people arriving in Europe.

Q: Do you think you owe part of the reduction to Merkel’s deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2016, in which Turkey agreed to curb the flow of refugees to Europe in exchange for payments from the E.U.?

A: Of course, this was helpful, but the whole approach in the E.U. changed. In 2015, many leaders talked about how we could organize so that those who want to come could come as quickly as possible. Now the approach is that we have to do more in the countries of origin — help people who are really suffering there but not take everybody who wants to have a better life in Europe. The goal is that people do not start to come to Europe.

Q: Isn’t climate change going to make parts of Africa uninhabitable? Isn’t there going to be ongoing income inequality? Won’t more refugees continue to come to Europe?

A: We have to fight climate change. The answer cannot be to accept climate change and take everybody who wants or has to leave their country of origin. That is not possible. At the moment, there are more than 1 billion people in Africa. At the end of the century, there will be 4 billion people. I don’t think the idea can be that most of them travel to Europe and start their lives here. We have to create better living conditions for people there.

[[This is what happens when climate change forces an entire country to seek higher ground](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/07/26/feature/this-is-what-happens-when-climate-change-forces-an-entire-country-to-seek-higher-ground/)]

Q: If you start to return refugees, aren’t you going to undermine migrants’ right to seek asylum guaranteed by the E.U.?

A: If someone gets a positive asylum decision in Austria, they are allowed to stay. What we try to do is to send back those who have a negative asylum decision.

Q: You’ve stated that one of your aims is to simulate economic growth. Austria’s growth rate was 2.7 percent in 2018. In all of Europe, growth is now slowing. How do you see the future of your economy?

A: I’m happy that the last year our growth rate was 2.7 percent — much better than most European countries. We did some labor law reforms, reduced bureaucracy and are now more attractive for investments. The unemployment rate is going down after many years. We are coming back to the top of the European Union, where we should be. What is not helpful is international uncertainty like the debate about the trade war in the U.S., the threat of imposing tariffs and Brexit.

1429,"Q: Did President Trump satisfy you about the trade war and tariffs?

A: What was satisfying to me was that we had the opportunity to explain our position. I think especially when you do not have the same approach, it’s good to have an exchange of views.

Q: Do you think that President Trump will come to a deal with China?

A: I had the impression that he wants to make a deal, and I hope he will be able to do so.

Q: Where do you stand on the European Union’s parliamentary elections coming up in May? Experts are saying that the European right led by [Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo] Salvini will do well. Do you think this is true? Do you think the E.U. must change?

A: I think that there is a lot of change necessary in the European Union. But I’m pro-European, so I support those who want to organize positive change, not those who want to destroy the European Union. I think that my party, the European People’s Party — a conservative party — will again become the strongest party in the European Parliament. I don’t think that the far-right party that Salvini belongs to is going to win the European elections, but they will, of course, win seats.

Related: [[Salvini: ‘Italy has done a lot — maybe too much’]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/italy-has-done-a-lot--maybe-too-much/2018/07/19/dc81a292-8acf-11e8-8aea-86e88ae760d8_story.html?tid=a_inl-amp)

Q: You said that the E.U. should change. How?

A: The European Union has to get stronger again. We have to solve the immigration crisis and to organize Brexit so we can focus on other issues. I hope that we can get economically more competitive again because the economic power of Europe is not a given. We have to work hard for that.

Q: How old were you when you held your first government position, state secretary of the interior for integration?

A: Twenty-four. The position is one level below minister. I was then the head of the youth organization of my party, and our party leader asked me to take this position. I tried to convince him that I was too young and that the media and people would not like the fact that a 24-year-old had became state secretary. The first year was extremely difficult. There was a lot of criticism because of my age.

Q: But three years later, you became foreign minister?

A: We had elections when I was 27, and I got the most votes in my party. After that, I became foreign minister. In those years, I had the impression that many decisions taken by the government were bad for our country — not only on migration but also on the economy. Things were going in the wrong direction: All the international rankings said that we were losing competitiveness, unemployment was going up and economic growth was low.

As the situation in our country became worse, I thought we had to ask for early elections to change the political system. Now, one year after the elections, we have shown that we can start the necessary change.

Q: What’s going to happen with Brexit?

A: Nobody knows. We hope we can avoid a no-deal scenario, a so-called “hard Brexit,” because this would mean chaos for the United Kingdom and hurt the economy of both the U.K. and the E.U. But I’m not sure it will be possible to get a majority in the British Parliament for the deal Prime Minister [Theresa] May made with the E.U.

Q: So there might be a hard Brexit?

A: I hope not. I think it’s terrible that the U.K. is leaving the E.U., and we have to do everything possible to avoid the no-deal scenario. If they have to leave, we must make sure that they leave in an organized way.

Q: You’re part of a new generation of young European leaders, and you seem to be popular. Have you seen something that other leaders haven’t?

A: We try to serve the people of Austria, to make reforms — even if they are unpopular — to put our country in a better position. I think people see our way is successful. We managed to reduce the unemployment rate, to increase the economic growth rate and to reduce taxes for hard-working people. We tried to integrate those who came as refugees to Austria during the last years, but on the other hand, we tried to reduce the flow of those who want to come but have no right to come to our country. I’m happy that we have the support of the people.

1434,"The problem is the constitution has to be amended first, and for that there needs to be an ammendment proposal with sufficient support within Spanish society. Right now the constitution grants full citizenship rights to every person born in Spain, which means if they were to secede unilaterally or without an agreement, they'd be effectively acquiring privileges in relation to the rest of Spain. Spanish nationals would lose all rights in Catalonia, while Catalans will get to retain full rights in Spain. This includes right to settle, access to public function, healthcare, right to vote... There are many services the state would be bound to grant. 

For example, one huge problem would be pensions. Catalan pensioners would have the right to claim a pension from Spain, but Catalan taxpayers would no longer be contributing to the Spanish pensions fund. This would create an enormous bonus for Catalonia and an enormous penalty for Spain. 

Nevermind that non Catalans would see their fundamental laws and constitutional rights become worthless in essence if they are found to be unilaterally voided. 

The only way to achieve a secession in fair terms would be to draw a proposition of terms that addresses these issues and binds a potential independent government to honor it, in a form that could be seen by enough Spaniards not as the demolition of their rights and an attack to their interests and opportunities. But so far nationalist parties have only played a game of antagonism to Spanish society and appealed to emotions, epic and symbols. They have promised a plentiful and flashy independent country while denying any of the problems or liabilities, refusing to see that the rest of spain has rights and interests which are legitimate for them to defend and legally protected.",,/r/europe/comments/at89kf/hundreds_of_thousands_across_catalonia_take_the/egzs8t1/,busarino,1550794309

Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz visited President Trump in the White House on Wednesday. Some European commentators call Kurz, 32, “the friendly face of populism,” while the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, has labeled him “a rock star” among European conservatives. But others worry about his alliance with the pro-Russian Freedom Party. Kurz shares one thing with Trump: He came to office warning of the dangers he says are posed by immigration. After his White House meeting, Kurz sat down with The Washington Post’s Lally Weymouth. Edited excerpts follow:

Q: You met President Trump earlier today. How did it go?

A: We have different approaches on many issues, but the main topic for us today was the trade relationship between the U.S. and the European Union. Austria is a very export-oriented country. Our second-biggest trading partner is the U.S. I hope that it will be possible to reach a deal between the E.U. and the United States to guarantee economic growth for the U.S. and also for Europe. Uncertainty or a negative development like a trade war would be bad for both sides.

Q: Doesn’t President Trump see the E.U. as a competitor?

A: In some areas, he definitely does. But I think that fair, free trade is in the interest of both sides. Many European and Austrian companies invest in the U.S. and create jobs.

Q: Where do you see things differently from President Trump?

A: There are issues like climate change. We think that we have to do something about climate change because we have to protect our environment.

Q: Are there other issues on which you disagree with President Trump?

A: On Nord Stream 2 [an underwater gas pipeline that runs between Russia and Germany, bypassing Ukraine], we have different positions. But there are also areas where we think that the U.S. is doing a good job. We are thankful for what the U.S. is doing in Korea — nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula is in the interest of all of us.

Q: When you became chancellor, many wondered why you went into a coalition with the right-wing Freedom Party, known to be pro-Russian and anti-Semitic.

A: There was no other opportunity. We have a system where you need to build coalitions to have a majority in parliament. The Social Democrats decided not to build a coalition with my party in which they were not in the lead. But we won the elections, so it was our right to lead the government. There was only one opportunity left, and that was the Freedom Party. Secondly, the Freedom Party supported our goals to make the necessary reforms to make the country economically more competitive.

Q: Why did you give the Freedom Party so many ministries — Defense, Interior, the Foreign Ministry and control over the intelligence services?

A: I think you have a very American view on this issue. In Austria, the minister for defense is also responsible for sports. We are not a superpower like the U.S. We are a small and neutral country. I would say that other ministries, like the Ministry for Finance — which you did not mention — are much more important.

Q: Which your party kept?

A: We took that. We have 14 ministries, and in eight, we [the Austrian People’s Party], as the bigger party, are in the lead. In six, our coalition partner [the Freedom Party] is in the lead.

Q: The Freedom Party’s background is troubling, and the Israeli government does not speak to its members because of their background and their responsibility for many anti-Semitic incidents. Yet you’re very pro-Israel. How does this work?

A: On Israel, our position is very clear, and our coalition partner supports us on that: We are very pro-Israel. We are also trying to fight successfully in the European Union against anti-Semitism. Because of Austria’s history, it is, from my point of view, our obligation to do that.

[How to tell when criticism of Israel is actually anti-Semitism]

Q: You rose to office supporting a tougher immigration policy. Do you regard German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to open Germany’s borders to refugees in 2015 as a mistake?

A: My position was always clear on these issues. We are not against immigration, but we want to have control on immigration. We want to decide who is allowed to come into Austria. We should not let human traffickers decide.

That’s the reason why in 2015, when many heads of state — not only Merkel, but others — were in favor of opening the borders, I criticized this policy and said the problem will get bigger and more people will start to come. Worse than that, many people will lose their lives in the Mediterranean Sea on their way to Europe. It took a lot of time, but the position in Europe has changed. Now my position is supported by most European leaders, and Europe has started to protect its external borders. We managed to reduce the flow of people arriving in Europe.

Q: Do you think you owe part of the reduction to Merkel’s deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2016, in which Turkey agreed to curb the flow of refugees to Europe in exchange for payments from the E.U.?

A: Of course, this was helpful, but the whole approach in the E.U. changed. In 2015, many leaders talked about how we could organize so that those who want to come could come as quickly as possible. Now the approach is that we have to do more in the countries of origin — help people who are really suffering there but not take everybody who wants to have a better life in Europe. The goal is that people do not start to come to Europe.

---------------------------------------



Q: Isn’t climate change going to make parts of Africa uninhabitable? Isn’t there going to be ongoing income inequality? Won’t more refugees continue to come to Europe?

A: We have to fight climate change. The answer cannot be to accept climate change and take everybody who wants or has to leave their country of origin. That is not possible. At the moment, there are more than 1 billion people in Africa. At the end of the century, there will be 4 billion people. I don’t think the idea can be that most of them travel to Europe and start their lives here. We have to create better living conditions for people there.

[This is what happens when climate change forces an entire country to seek higher ground]

Q: If you start to return refugees, aren’t you going to undermine migrants’ right to seek asylum guaranteed by the E.U.?

A: If someone gets a positive asylum decision in Austria, they are allowed to stay. What we try to do is to send back those who have a negative asylum decision.

Q: You’ve stated that one of your aims is to simulate economic growth. Austria’s growth rate was 2.7 percent in 2018. In all of Europe, growth is now slowing. How do you see the future of your economy?

A: I’m happy that the last year our growth rate was 2.7 percent — much better than most European countries. We did some labor law reforms, reduced bureaucracy and are now more attractive for investments. The unemployment rate is going down after many years. We are coming back to the top of the European Union, where we should be. What is not helpful is international uncertainty like the debate about the trade war in the U.S., the threat of imposing tariffs and Brexit.

Q: Did President Trump satisfy you about the trade war and tariffs?

A: What was satisfying to me was that we had the opportunity to explain our position. I think especially when you do not have the same approach, it’s good to have an exchange of views.

Q: Do you think that President Trump will come to a deal with China?

A: I had the impression that he wants to make a deal, and I hope he will be able to do so.

Q: Where do you stand on the European Union’s parliamentary elections coming up in May? Experts are saying that the European right led by [Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo] Salvini will do well. Do you think this is true? Do you think the E.U. must change?

A: I think that there is a lot of change necessary in the European Union. But I’m pro-European, so I support those who want to organize positive change, not those who want to destroy the European Union. I think that my party, the European People’s Party — a conservative party — will again become the strongest party in the European Parliament. I don’t think that the far-right party that Salvini belongs to is going to win the European elections, but they will, of course, win seats.

[Salvini: ‘Italy has done a lot — maybe too much’]

Q: You said that the E.U. should change. How?

A: The European Union has to get stronger again. We have to solve the immigration crisis and to organize Brexit so we can focus on other issues. I hope that we can get economically more competitive again because the economic power of Europe is not a given. We have to work hard for that.

Q: How old were you when you held your first government position, state secretary of the interior for integration?

A: Twenty-four. The position is one level below minister. I was then the head of the youth organization of my party, and our party leader asked me to take this position. I tried to convince him that I was too young and that the media and people would not like the fact that a 24-year-old had became state secretary. The first year was extremely difficult. There was a lot of criticism because of my age.

Q: But three years later, you became foreign minister?

A: We had elections when I was 27, and I got the most votes in my party. After that, I became foreign minister. In those years, I had the impression that many decisions taken by the government were bad for our country — not only on migration but also on the economy. Things were going in the wrong direction: All the international rankings said that we were losing competitiveness, unemployment was going up and economic growth was low.

As the situation in our country became worse, I thought we had to ask for early elections to change the political system. Now, one year after the elections, we have shown that we can start the necessary change.

Q: What’s going to happen with Brexit?

A: Nobody knows. We hope we can avoid a no-deal scenario, a so-called “hard Brexit,” because this would mean chaos for the United Kingdom and hurt the economy of both the U.K. and the E.U. But I’m not sure it will be possible to get a majority in the British Parliament for the deal Prime Minister [Theresa] May made with the E.U.

Q: So there might be a hard Brexit?

A: I hope not. I think it’s terrible that the U.K. is leaving the E.U., and we have to do everything possible to avoid the no-deal scenario. If they have to leave, we must make sure that they leave in an organized way.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not assuming this or ethical considerations are the primary considerations to the export halt - I figure shortterm negative PR is much more likely as a primary factor, especially considering this is a *halt* of sales to SA, not a stop or outlawing of the same.

https://www.amazon.com/Money-Mischief-Episodes-Monetary-History/dp/015661930X

People here are couching it in pretty facile, simplistic terms. The world's flow of currencies is actually quite complex and there is no actual ""reserve currency"" by decree. The US dollar just happens to be a claim on the world's largest economy and is therefore most often used for international transactions (that and the fact that the Saudis use oil dollars to buy American weapons in vast quantities).

But as for why it is not gold, it *was* gold, if effect, for a long, long time--that is, export and import flows (as well as international investments) were balanced by physical transfers of gold. 

Then after WW2, the major powers adopted the Bretton Woods convention, whereby the US dollar would be pegged to gold and other currencies would float off the dollar. Bretton Woods was abandoned in 1972 for a floating fiat money system. This was unstable for a while (with high inflation rates in the US and elsewhere) until 1982, when the US figured out how to limit the supply of dollars to its own economic growth rate

Today, the dollar is thus very stable and is in effect a substitute for gold, though you can of course freely buy gold wholesale in your etrade account, if you prefer to park your money there",,/r/europe/comments/at1tl4/european_countries_by_total_wealth_billions_usd/egzi3bz/,oilman81,1550786876

Capitalism, or rather the economics of the free market, was born in Europe (the Austrian School of Economics, Ludwig von Mises and not the imbecile of Marx), the freedom of the individual was born mainly in England, which made the US pursue such a policy. Formerly, people felt proud of Europeans, they worked hard on everything, the Europeans finally created the most powerful empire in the world, that is the British Empire and now the US (people built big skyscrapers because they felt the need, no one forced them).

1603,"There are basically two bike types. 

- ""Dutch style"" which have a heavy rear wheel. The chain is in a box, you brake by kicking back on the pedal and if you have  gearshift it is mostly just 3 or 5 gears. When you change the gears it pulls a little string in the center of the rear wheel. The gears are all inside and not visible. The chain is always relatively tight.

On ""Dutch style bike"" changing the rear wheel is a pain in the ass, because you have to take off the chain casing, unscrew the kickback-brake-holder, detach the gear cable, then unscrew the wheel and pull it out. When putting it back in you need to make sure that the wheel is straight *and* the chain is correctly  tightened.

- on ""sports""-bikes you brake the rear wheel with a handbrake, just like you do with the front wheel. Those can be V-brakes, cantilever breaks, whatever, but they usually consist of two rubber blocks that are pulled against the wheel rim. Usually, it is easy to just disconnect the steel cable and the brakes will open up to let the tire pass. 

Those bikes have a ""derailleur"" gear shift, which moves the chain from one gear wheel to another (those little toothed wheels on the rear wheel). Typically you have 5-8 gears on the rear wheel and 2-3 at the pedals, making for 10-24 possible different ratios. This system is lighter and more versatile but is incompatible with kickback-braking.

The chain is much looser - you can just pull on it, it's just a little spring that keeps it tight enough to stay on. The chain makes a little loop at the rear wheel for that. Those bikes can't enclose the chain because it moves so much. Mostly you just have a little shield at the pedals to protect your pants.

It is easy to unmount the rear wheel on those bikes because you don't do anything how the gear shift and you don't need to deal with a tight chain when you take it out or put it back in.",,/r/europe/comments/at2ugg/dutch_police_repairing_this_kids_bicycle/egz6i29/,xrimane,1550779119

1658,"&gt; I have no idea why College makes people more liberal and open minded. This is something that needs to be studied by anthropologists. That said its a well known fact.

High education breeds a lot of people who believe in socialism so does that mean socialism is better system ? No. 

You are trying to argue that people who have higher education should have more important vote.

But that is not how voting works. If you have higher education you will naturally avoid living in rural area because you want to maximalize your profits so you move to town.

Do you see now why rural people vote for parties like PIS ? Because elite aka educated person does not care about those people. He will not open business in village. He will vote for anyone who will promise that his city will grow ignoring villages and smaller towns

This is why rural voters vote for parties like PIS.

&gt;I am just saying what PiS is doing in undemocratic and incompetent. Democracy in Poland is still new and fragile and PiS is not doing it any good.

""Undemocratic"" - you do realize that they were chosen by people got majority in parliament and run exactly on stuff like not having immigration quota, changes in judiciary system and so on.

So who exactly here is undemocratic when minority wants to rule majority. 

&gt;Once we get rid of those anti democratic tendencies we can go from there.

To where ? When new party will come nothing PIS did will change because all of them understand it was needed. There will be no back to Judicary rules from before PIS nor they will suddenly be pro-immigration.

They will have their own new programs and their own people to fill seats in government companies.

&gt; Putting his cronies in courts.

This argument never made sense from start. Do you understand that education and lawmakers are all mostly left wing in Poland ?

I mean you just talked about how collage makes most of people liberal and now you claim they are all cronnies. PIS doesn't care who will become judge. All they care about is to nuke old judges who embodied corruption in polish judicary which they think is key to changing quality of polish judicary system.

You wouldn't know that because you don't read right wing opinions on those issues.

Seriously if you live in Poland buy something like Angora which usually shows you article from left-centre paper and then next article from right wing on exact same issue. You will quickly realize that they are not stupid like press seems to argue or ""undemocratic"".

Their judicary changes are just continuation of what they started in 2006 when they ruled and back then no one had any opposition to it, judges naturally had but both PO and PIS supported those changes, they never finished though because their government fell apart after Samoobrona scandal.

16 April 2002

 

""Sunday 21 July marks the 30th anniversary of an IRA operation in Belfast in 1972 which resulted in nine people being killed and many more injured.

While it was not our intention to injure or kill non-combatants, the reality is that on this and on a number of other occasions, that was the consequence of our actions.

It is therefore appropriate on the anniversary of this tragic event, that we address all of the deaths and injuries of non-combatants caused by us.

We offer our sincere apologies and condolences to their families.

There have been fatalities amongst combatants on all sides. We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives.

The future will not be found in denying collective failures and mistakes or closing minds and hearts to the plight of those who have been hurt. That includes all of the victims of the conflict, combatants and non-combatants.

It will not be achieved by creating a hierarchy of victims in which some are deemed more or less worthy than others.

The process of conflict resolution requires the equal acknowledgement of the grief and loss of others. On this anniversary, we are endeavouring to fulfil this responsibility to those we have hurt.

The IRA is committed unequivocally to the search for freedom, justice and peace in Ireland.

We remain totally committed to the peace process and to dealing with the challenges and difficulties which this presents. This includes the acceptance of past mistakes and of the hurt and pain we have caused to others.""

-	100’s of people who have experience (mostly from the Syrian conflict), skills, means and motive to carry out serious attacks
-	1000’s of people who are willing to help in attacks
-	10000’s of people who are deemed enough of a threat to have police files

For context: Noone gets tickets while riding a bike, and I was nothing but polite and respectful to them. I definitely didn't project an attitude that I thought I could do whatever I want.

Also, the immigration police, who are part of the police department, used to lie to me about my rights, trying to discourage me from staying in the Netherlands. Every time I would talk to a lawyer, find out the truth, and go back to them. And every single time they would add a new lie on top, so I would have to go back to the lawyers and get the truth. This went on for years, and whenever I confronted them with the truth, they got angry, to the point where one of them called me an asshole and tried to jump over the counter, but his colleagues pulled him back down.

For context: I'm American and I learned Dutch and was fluent within 6 months and had a full time job, while a friend who got pregnant while in Ecuador brought the guy back to the Netherlands. He lived in a nearby village Rosmalen, and immediately was put on the dole, never learned the language, never visited his kid, and never got a job other than selling drugs on the street. It turned out he had over twenty children, many of them in different countries, and he used that to travel around. His father has 50 kids, he said. 

So most Dutch police are a hell of a lot better than most American police, but they're not all perfect either.

1794,"Maybe we're talking about different things but I don't quite follow your argument.


My point was that it was not the actions (and therefore not the consequence of these actions) of Carl XII that lost Sweden the war but outside factors which he did not control.

Hitler started a war with terrible odds for winning and made things even worse by playing general (and a number of other things that were bad for the German military's chance of success).  Therefore his leadership itself had a negative impact on Germany and he can be considered a bad ruler. 

If I was alive in 1942 and agreed with his goal and methods perhaps I would think he was great (as many did, also here in sweden) but the war was not over at that time and history showed that he lost.

Charles XII tried to defend the swedish empire against foreign aggressors against the odds and lost. Maybe a king more skilled in diplomacy could have done a better job but as I said, I don't believe the actions of the king themselves had a negative impact on the fate of sweden, in fact if he had survived a bit longer he might have succeeded in his Norwegian campaign and left sweden in a more favourable position to negotiate the peace. Therefore I think it's odd to blame him for the loss of the Baltic provinces. Had he in fact started the war and done a bad job running it I would agree with you.

Gustav IV Adolf for instance was the king when we later lost Finland to the russians and one could argue that many of his actions actively led to this loss. The same can hardly be said about Charles XII and the loss in the great nordic war. He was dealt a crappy hand and managed to do the best of it.


What are your thoughts on Mannerheim? During his time as the leader of the Finnish forces in the second world war his country lost a big chunk of its most valuable land through military defeat. Does that make his actions and the consequence of them bad? I would argue not considering the fact that Finland remained an independent country when the Baltic states were absorbed by the Soviet union. He also did the best he could with the resources he had and I would say Finland would be a lot worse off had he not.

Maybe use Gustav IV Adolf or Hitler (or any other of the crappy non democratic leaders in history, 
of which there are plenty) as the example of bad dictators next time to avoid confusion? :)",,/r/europe/comments/ast5n2/billboard_welcoming_theresa_may_in_brussels/egywwkn/,Sgtpepper92,1550772759

1887,"&gt; Democracy is not inherently bad, but when people are given the right to vote on extremely complex geopolitical issues while being completely uneducated and unaware of the ramifications of their monumentous decision that is where relying on a fully democratic process like a referendum is the height of absurdity.


But then how do you deal with situations where a large part of the country, possibly a majority, does not want to remain in the European Union, but doesn't see this viewpoint properly represented in their representative democracy? 


I feel like part of the failure of this referendum is the lack of earlier referendums and the inability of politicians to truly reflect their constitutions viewpoints. It creates a disconnect between the people and the politics of their country. In such a situation I think it's to be expected that whenever people to get a chance to make themselves heard, they'll just vote against the establishment regardless of the issue. Not having referendums anymore doesn't solve this problem. It just creates a stronger feeling of not being heard and more resentment towards mainstream politics. Eventually that is going to have to come out. By denouncing referendums we'd just be postponing that. If you want to solve the core issue, I think having discussions about important issues is vital. And you don't get a discussion if one side doesn't feel heard and is constantly patronized. That just means that only one side is talking and eventually the other side stops listening. 


And I'm not saying the Brexiteers are right, but they do exist and not listening or talking to them is not going to make them go away.


&gt;However, for issues like a referendum I believe people should have to take a test prior to voting which shows that they fully understand the issues which they are voting on because basing your decision on a single issue and ignoring all the rest is akin to cutting off your nose to spite your face. 


There's no point in holding a referendum if you're going to exclude part of the population anyway. I'm sorry, but that's about as democratic as an 1-man ballot. You're just going to be wasting a ton of money, insulting a lot of people and in the end you'll get the result you wanted in the first place. I don't think a test like this is much different from the Jim Crow laws that disenfranchised black Americans.

That Finland would've been a 3rd world country before X, Y or Z is a myth which is propagated, but it's false and show a poor knowledge of Finnish economical history and history in general.

There are tons of proofs proving that the Greek presence in Anatolia was minimal

3- [Scientists never compare Turks to Greeks but to Ancient Anatolians and to Central Asians obviously.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_studies_on_Turkish_people)

1953,"As a preface to this, I am not certain if Jew and Arab are the correct demonyms for Israeli people who also happen to be Jewish or Arabic. But I am too lazy to find out the correct terms so just pretend that I am saying Jewish Israeli person and Arabic Israeli person whenever I say Jew or Arab.

Let me type in ""Israel apartheid"" into Google. Oh, who could have imagined, there's a [Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_the_apartheid_analogy) called ""Israel and the apartheid analogy"". Let's see what it says.

* The ""Population Registry Law"" which requires all residents of Israel to register their nationality. And would you look at that, apartheid South Africa had something called the ""Population Registration Act"". That's an awfully similar name. It categorised all South Africans by race. That sounds a bit familiar too. It's almost as if Israel is segregating people based on nationality instead of  race.

*The ""Jewish State bill"" (not the actual name, but the full name is a lot longer).  It explicitly restricts the rights of self-determination to Jews and allows the establishment of segregated towns. This bill was passed like 6 months ago btw.

*While not forbidding Arabs from attending the same schools as Jews, schools in Israel are either taught in Arabic or Hebrew (some bilingual schools do exist). Because of this, most Arabs study in the Arabic schools and most Jews study in Hebrew schools. And to nobodies surprise, the Israeli government just happens to spend more money per student in the Hebrew schools than in the Arabic schools.

There's a few reasons but I'll focus on one thing; there is a right wing press that approve of her, or at least used to be before this all kicked into the craziness it's reached now. I have no idea anymore because I've just basically started ignoring the news for the most part. 

As a politician, May seems completely unremarkable but seems to base a lot of her stance and ""success"" around the ideas of what the press are saying and their fundamental goals, which has given her party far more votes than they should have got based on policy and the lies they've told the public in regards to so many issues. She has been a blank slate for the Daily Mail. 

The press, which is seemingly the embodiment of an idiotic, rambling, shouty, paranoid cock-spout, but is likely more just a cynical cash-making and power-grabbing machine for wealthy parasites, wants brexit hard, regardless of whether we regress to the backwards inbred island that we actually are (and should fight against) . 

That puts may in a difficult position. And corbyn. I think neither would actually choose brexit (even if corbyn personally wants it) but both recognise the loss of status and political power by alienating the loudest twat in the room (the right wing media) and the voters who chose brexit. Then there's a bunch of MPs who would turn on her and tear apart the party, which would lead to them losing power. 

I'm pretty sure if there was another referendum, remain would win (though I'm sort of ignoring the power of the press to pump out propaganda) but there would be consequences. Any of those consequences are preferable to any option that takes away or dilutes what we currently have in regards to the EU.

My personal belief is that she knows that brexit is pretty dumb, cutting off your ear because you think you have ear ache is stupid, but she can't go against it. I think she's playing all her options (that no one agrees to) and will eventually delay the whole thing until the buck passes. It wouldn't surprise me if the deadline is delayed, although the EU may have already ruled this out, it's certainly in no one's interest to keep this stupidity hanging over us all. 

I sincerely hope that she wouldn't leave without a deal, it would be economic and political suicide (and literal suicide for many people), but I also don't think there's enough time for a second refendum at this point (though it could be a reason to delay article 50).

Its understood that when voting for an MP that they're term will be at maximum 5 years before another vote. Sure, a snap election could bring that closer in time, but the limit of 5 years stand.

How you can sit there and honestly pretend that this is in any way comparable to a nation brexit vote where the public is deciding to permanently leave the EU. It was not written in that vote ""This is simply an initial vote and after negotiations you will get to look at the possibilities and choose again"". It was understood that what was voted for would occur'.

Is it okay to continually invalidate previous votes that were intended to be permanent. It is more comparable to a hypothetical situation where there was a referendum in Ireland to bring abortion into the constitution. A second brexit vote would be like if the Irish went ""Right well we understand that you voted for abortion and all but theres some issues putting the legislation through, and we know we told you in the last referendum that what was voted on would definitely happen, but just forget that for a second, were having another one so that one doesn't matter even though we said it would"".

Should there be a live wire connected into the brains of every UK citizen where their opinion on every law within the UK is measured and entered into a massive database, where the information and opinions on laws are accumulated into one large fluctuating dataset that is constantly changing the laws based on the whims of the people?

They voted to leave and it was understood that what they voted on to occur will occur.

1. She openly said she doesn't care for what he was convicted for, **so she doesn't care if the judgement was really violating his rights or not**. She would like to protest regardless if a violation had taken place.  My reading is that she is the one who really doesn't care about rights, if she acts following a monolithic opinion and she doesn't act based on solid facts.
2. She said she wanted him not deported because he is human. That's not even an argument. A court condemns someone because of his actions, not for the species he belongs to.

&gt; Brexit was a mutiny. Like all mutinies, it was driven by anger at authority rather than by a strategy for the future. To date, the consequences have been to deepen polarisation, but triumphant victory for either side is not the way forward. That there is no majority for any of the current options is entirely understandable: they are all awful. We can only break the polarisation with a new strategy. The Brexit mutiny should have been a wake-up call. Instead, the elite are angry that the mutiny was not suppressed, while the mutineers have become ever more distrustful. There is a way out of this nightmare.
&gt; 
&gt; Why are all the Brexit options awful? There is no mystery: it is essential for ‘Brussels’ (aka ‘Germany and France’) that any form of exit must be sufficiently damaging to the UK so that no other country will leave. The tactical British mistake was to hand Brussels the power to inflict this damage. We did this by falling into the trap of unilaterally serving notice of withdrawal in accordance with Article 50. As it was designed to do, this strips the country that seeks to withdraw of its bargaining power, which rests on active participation as a member in the key centres of decision-taking. It was through our past intelligent use of this power that Britain was able to achieve negotiating triumphs such as exemptions from the euro and Schengen, the right for the City to become the main trading centre of the euro despite the UK not being in it, and uniquely, our budget rebate.
&gt; 
&gt; ‘You don’t negotiate with a tiger while your head is in its mouth,’ says Churchill in Darkest Hour. He got our head out by lifting the troops off the beaches. We must use our sovereign right unilaterally to withdraw our Article 50 notification. Once withdrawn, our bargaining position will rapidly transform. In May a new European Parliament will be elected, and a new commission and president chosen. The major political currents in Europe will at last be working in our favour.
&gt; 
&gt; As Angela Merkel fades away, Sebastian Kurz will replace her as Europe’s most influential political leader. As the French and Germans bicker in disillusion, Italy and central Europe will seek to destabilise. We will find ourselves in the balance-of-power position that has been our forte for centuries. We can use this influence either to modify the EU into an enterprise that is more compatible with what our citizens want, or to quietly negotiate an agreed exit with other powerful countries, so that a subsequent Article 50 application would be precooked.
&gt; 
&gt; As an interim measure, we should aim to negotiate a belated seven-year transition arrangement to free movement. Although the EU will not reverse ‘free movement’, Britain is uniquely disadvantaged by our global language, by having abandoned our non-contributory benefits system, having deregulated our labour market, having dismantled our training system, and by our own folly in not using the seven-year transition option following the admission of eastern European countries that was taken up by everyone else. An appeal based on an admission of that folly would do much to rebuild relationships.
&gt; 
&gt; During that window, and regardless of whether we end up leaving or remaining, we need to address the root causes of the Brexit mutiny. We should restructure our benefits system, invest massively in training, and begin the task of rejuvenating our provincial economies. Half the population feels ‘abandoned’, the word hurled at me during a recent public lecture in Durham.
&gt; 
&gt; All healthy societies rest on the widespread acceptance of a dense web of reciprocal obligations among citizens. Underpinning this is a recognition of shared identity built through social interaction, common endeavours, shared history and shared futures, since this generates a presumption of fellow feeling. Psychologically, this is what citizenship of a healthy society means. For the less successful half of the population, such citizenship is a vital asset because with it comes the reassurance that the more successful half accepts obligations towards them. It is this confidence that has gradually been eroded, as the successful have peeled off from the shared national identity to self–congratulatory new spatial and class identities as ‘Londoners’ and ‘highly skilled’. Reversing a long period of convergence, for the past four decades the south-east of England has diverged from the rest of the country, and wage differentials have widened.
&gt; 
&gt; ADVERTISING
&gt; 
&gt; inRead invented by Teads Immigration has gained prominence beyond its overall importance, because it has been used by elites to accentuate difference from others, compounding the fundamental loss of confidence in reciprocity. The metropolitan skilled condemn others as ‘racist’, yet there are sound reasons for the less successful to be wary of rapid immigration. Those immigrants in the bottom half of society are indeed competitors for the diminishing generosity of the successful. Even successful immigrants have ambiguous effects. Concentrated disproportionately in the south-east, they have few social connections with the provincial population who feel most threatened by abandonment.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, business claims smugly that ‘We need immigrants’. Business of course prefers cheap immigrant labour to paying higher wages to citizens; similarly, it prefers to recruit trained foreign labour than to spend money training young citizens. These are simply divergences of interest between business and society. The metropolitan commentator Janan Ganesh aptly, and brutally, captured London’s perspective on provincial England as being ‘shackled to a corpse’. No wonder those outside such smugness have lost confidence in the sympathy of their fellow citizens.
&gt; 
&gt; People have become impatient with the strident ideologues. As the waters break in the Labour party, the hour for pragmatism has arrived.

He complains that Carlson is funded by billionaires but why do you think he was invited by billionaires to speak at Davos? Maybe his ideas are not so different to theirs on some issues.

And rather than billionaires, Carlson is funded by advertiser revenue from the millions of ordinary people that watch the show. It shouldn't be a surprise that a popular TV presenter with a multi million person audience is a millionaire.

Rutger claims that 80% income tax rates worked well in the 50s and 60s so we should go back to that. He does not provide any evidence or other arguments to support that. Income tax rates were high on high earners back then probably to try to win over poorer voters and prevent growing support for full blown communism. They weren't high because they were necessarily a good idea. Economic success in the post war period came from big improvements in technology and developing a consumer economy.

And just because something worked OK back in the 50s and 60s, doesn't mean it would work now. I don't think there are any countries with 80% tax rates now. If it was a good idea you would think at least one would do it. [According to the Laffer curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp) there is a certain point at which increasing the tax rate would start to reduce tax revenue. When taxes rise, high income people would choose to work less, choose to move country or choose to invest somewhere else.

It's not one dude, it's the entire wikipedia doing that.

&gt; while having the same customs, language, religion as the rest of Romania.

In general but there are differences between each romanian provinces, and not just in architecture, minor customs, regionalisms and accent, but also in religion. For example, giving the last census (2011), the amount of orthodox people in Satu Mare is 46%, in Mures 51%, in Bihor 55%, ... , in Cluj 68%, not to mention Covasna 20% and Harghita 12%, and that is all in the old region, and after the communism tried to homogenize the population. The only regions where orthodoxy is over 90% is in Muntenia+Oltenia. So how can you not see differences? 

&gt; Yes, some people are still nostalgic about the period when the hungarians or germans were rulling over the romanian majority. that doesent make the region more german or hungarian.

Who is nostalgic? None of the actual people, as most of them haven't lived through that time. I know I don't and never thought of it either. On the other hand this city I was born and live in (Brasov) was build because of the saxons, and most of the benefits comes from it. When you visit it, try and learn about its history, and why there is a big statue for Johannes Honterus and other similar things. Btw, how many german and hungarian (high)schools do you have in Constanta? I know we have both here. I'm sorry that I'm not like other romanians (from south) claiming everything is romanian.

&gt; I can assure you, most buildings and industry in that city were build after 1918. But is ok, some hungarians love do delete everything that the romanians did.

Nope, and a lot of it's building dates back to centuries ago. Here are [some pics](https://imgur.com/a/QclM7dz) from before your  named 1918. Industry in Brasov before 1918? 

1859 - already existed 15 factories

1871 - 25 factories

1873 - 40 factories

1911 - 1918 - 49 factories

Some of them might be know as they survived even the communism: 1823 tesatoria (textures) Wilhelm Scherg, named Carpatex during communism; 1833 turnatoria (foundry) Julius Teutsch, named IUS during communism and MOB today; 1880 fabrica de masini Fraţii Schiell, known as Hidromecanica during communism, demolished in the recent years to make today AFI Brasov; 1881 fabrica Scherg, fabrica de stofe in communism; 1889 fabrica de zahar Bod, still existing today; 1891 fabrica de ciment Kugler, in communism known as Temelia, demolished like 20 years ago or so; 1899 fabrica de ciocolata Hess, having different names later (Desrobirea, Cibo, Poiana produse zaharoase, Kraft Foods), demolished not long ago and sold the rest to Lidl; 1911 fabrica de tigle si teracota Schmidt, known as Prod.Refractare and Fareb in communism, today Refarom; 1892 fabrica de bere Czell, today SAB Miller.

&gt;And still, Transylvania is orthodox, and the majority of population is orthodox, but i like how you tried to evade that reality.

Nope, as shown by the census.

2195,"&gt; They will obviously have to do the pregnancy, the birth and breast feeding.

And taking a major share of taking care of the child during early infancy. I am yet to meet a child psychologist who would argue that mothers are equally important to fathers within the first 1-4 years of the child's life and that the mother's absence in this period would not be harmful for the child. Father's role in this period is to support the mother as much as he can; by the time the child turns 4, their roles more or less equalise and then it makes more sense to incentivise fathers to assume an equal share in child rearing.

However, taking the above into account, even in the best case, motherhood requires that a woman devotes at least 3 years of her life to full-time childcare, per kid. So two children (the minimum to maintain stable demographic profile of a country) means a woman has to give 6 years and that's a big ask for many women.

That's the huge obstacle and the main reason why birth rates suck all around the developed world – this is almost culture-independent as it affect developed societies in Europe as well as Asia and the Americas. Wherever a family needs both parents to work to secure a sufficient income to live comfortably, women are faced with a choice of harming their career (and thus the family's income) or having children. Having children then leads to lower retirement pensions, worse position at the job market, etc. This is why women need to be supported more in these regards to motivate them to have children. Mandatory father's leaves and whatnot in the first years of the child's life are, in my opinion, an ideological gesture that has little to do with what women actually need or want.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/asusr9/hungarysweden_row_over_nazi_germany_comparison/egy126h/,Victor_D,1550744234

By UK law, a contract entered into under false pretenses can be voided. The law makes a distinction between deceit and negligence in these cases, and it's open for debate which of these the Leave campaign is guilty of, but I think it has become abundantly clear that the people of the UK made a decision based on information that was at best willfully ignorant and at worst malicious and fraudulent. Of course, these laws (tort laws) specifically apply to commercial and civil cases, but I see no reason a similar principle shouldn't be applied in this case. For a population to make a decision based on false information and then be given no recourse when that falseness if revealed seems absurd.

It's like if your parents offered you two bags, and your father tells you one has a biscuit in it and your creepy, conspiracy-theory-spouting uncle tells you the other has cake in it.

Please, can I have the biscuit instead?"" And your parents say, ""No, you can't change your mind, and it is our job to make sure your will is carried out."" ""But my will was to have a nice slice of cake, not dog poo!""

However if we had UBI like I mentioned, I could see someone working and then the government would document what else they needed for basic living conditions.

Do you want to just stay in the single market/customs union?

Do you want to keep free movement?

Do you want May's Brexit deal adopted or not?, etc.etc.

In the UK we have a culture of 'do as I say, not as I do'. It easily opens the door to corruption and most of the public actually agree with the sentiment. It's why people keep, repeatedly voting against their best interests because they hear words they agree with irrespective of truth or benefit. 

Going back to the original question. May can ethically devote herself to being a europhile in charge of UK's EU exit because she genuinely wants as much power as possible. This actually net benefits her goals. She's wanted to scrap human rights for a long time now and if she's in the top seat when the government makes the decisions on what EU laws to keep (which they can do without oversight following laws passed, I might add) she can scrap lots of the human and workers rights that have been irking her and her party for some time.

The system is designed with perfection in mind. The real issue that in practice the only imperfect element is humans themselves. If you can't realize that every political system is an utopic one, since it demands that everyone follows a specific pattern of a role within the system. 

Democracies work very good at the beginning, and tend to fail afterwards exactly because at the beginning everyone tries its best, then down the line people start to take things for granted, and slack off their duties.

Socialistic and Communistic political systems have the same ride. Even oligarchic and feudalistic systems at their birth work as intended, because the people in charge are carefully chosen, and they have the charisma and personal quality to move the nation forward. Down the line they become a nepotistic hellhole. 

It's not arrogance. It's the reality. Unless you prefer we go back to some form of elective monarchy. Because the basic instinct of humans in a group is to seek out a leader to provide guidance.

Freedom is great but the second your freedom to be misinformed infringes on the rights and wellbeing of your fellow countrymen and adversely affects them that is where your freedom should end. 

This is very similar to the debate on vaccination, people read fake news supported by anecdotal evidence presented to them by echo chambers and come to the conclusion that vaccination is bad, as a result they are free to not vaccinate, that results in a huge uptick in the prevalence of diseases which should be all but eradicated in the first world and condemns people with immunodeficiencies and those  who can't be vaccinated to potential disease which can affect them for the rest of their lives. 

Would you argue that one persons individual right to not vaccinate should trump the well-being of those who cannot be vaccinated? This is exactly the same, except instead of demanding that they should be jabbed with a needle I am demanding that they be informed of the facts. The number of people that suffer from bregret (regret for voting for brexit) directly supports the fact that they were misinformed and manipulated into voting a way in which they don't truly support.

I was in the UK during and prior to the brexit vote and I saw the way media coverage of the issue changed as if a switch was flipped once brexit became a reality. 

Prior to brexit most news sources were just trumpeting the same tired, poorly researched, pro brexit garbage, once it happened however the facts and objective analysis started to emerge, it was honestly infuriating.

Yes I believe people are largely uninformed but it isn't due to a lack of intelligence or anything, people just don't have the time to do the research, that is why tweets, facebook posts and 5 minute youtube videos are so appealing, they seemingly cover the entire issue and make it palatable to people who don't have time to do more research, the problem arises when those news sources are skewed one way or another and drive people not into forming their own opinions with objective facts but telling them exactly what to think.",,/r/europe/comments/ast5n2/billboard_welcoming_theresa_may_in_brussels/egxki7y/,Razorfiend,1550722736

Britain was still linked to Gaul through trade and it's likely that cooperation existed in warding off pirates through the network of coastal forts both sides of the Channel, the so called Saxon Shore.

There is uncertainty about the kingdom of Dumnonia in whether it existed solely in southwest Britain or whether it also held control over parts of Armorica. This is the kingdom where most of the immigrants to Armorica seem to have come from, though the settlements were mostly in the western and central parts of Brittany. Brittany later expanded east to the borders it now has and the Cotentin peninsula in Normandy was briefly part of Brittany though it appears to have been a no-mans land between Brittany and France which is one of the reasons why the French were happy to have the vikings in this border region.

2499,"I mean, that's not *wrong* but that's also massively oversimplifying what communist ideology actually believes to the point of being wrong.


Communism is, first and most importantly, the collective (and by collective i mean actually collective, like anyones allowed to use it, not Soviet collective, where the state basically just made people slaves under the logic that because the people are the state, and the things are being produced by the state, the people are *technically* working for themselves even though they clearly aren't) access to the means of production.


It's not unreasonable to say humans can handle that.



And also, I don't buy into this idea that humans nature is inherently greedy and shitty. There will still be sociopaths, that's just a born thing, but like, you have to remember we've only ever seen humans raised in systems that actively promoted greed and being shitty to people since they're very birth. And even then some people are able to rise above their shitty circumstances and still be a good person.





Ask yourself this, if humans are inherently evil, why can you find a youtube tutorial for like almost every obscure issue, even if only a few people will ever see it and it will gain them no money or popularity? Why do people find a fix to a problem with some code on some old game from the 90's and instead of doing the ""natural"" thing and saying ""welp glad i fixed that, now to play it without ever telling anyone because who cares"" instead say ""I'm gonna spend my time and energy making a detailed tutorial with registered hypercam for free for to tell people you have to set this thing to ""running=false"" in notepad and put in a directory"". There's no motivation to in a lot of cases, they just want to help people for some reason.


I mean I still think Communism wouldnt work *now* in the current world we live in with all it's given circumstances. And kinda falls apart at just the question ""well who gets the houses that are already here?"". But not because of human nature, instead because we've simply been capitalist too long and now it's permanently tied into everything. To change the system that radically would mean causing immense amounts of suffering and upheaval in the forseeable future.



But if we lived in a timeline where instead of that, Communism started in the industrialized Britain or France or Germany or America in the 1800s, things might have worked out. But they didn't so things will suck until automation replaces a ton of jobs and cause extreme high unemployment, then we'll have to be forced to re evaluate the viability of this economic system.

That's simply not how humans work, we are as cooperative as we are tribally violent - raw tyranny does not hold.

There are also some serious technical problems with the claim that countries only seek their own gain, two being:

* What is a *country's* ""gain"" meant to mean? Countries do not gain, *individuals within countries* gain. The political aristocracy of Britain makes decisions in its own interest far more readily than in favour of the rest of the country. They would sell their countrymen down the river if it meant personal gain as a consequence of foreign cooperation - this happens all the time in every country.

* Why is a ""country"" the unit of centrism to you? People do not operate exclusively on national lines but religious, ethnic and ideological. There used to exist a clear and advocated conceptualisation of ""Christendom"", where much as say Britain and Germany could disagree politically they had preference for one another within a religious dimension compared to other places on Earth.

Fair.  Yes I did things in the opposite manner.

It does. They left insignificant traces because they were an insignificant population. As their oldest cemetary proved it, with 107 tombs in over 200 years. A small village with a few hundreds habitants would have more tombs in 20 years. That's how small the Jewish population was.

What you brought up, the Penang cemetary, proved they left no trace before 1805 and were so insignificant they were only 107 to have a tomb there in over 200 years.

Yes, the EU is in itself a democracy. But for people for a small country, your sway is very little and EU law is still very much your law. In fact, more so than your national law. National courtage rule in favour of EU law when national law and EU law conflict.

I’m for the EU because I am a free market liberal living in a social democratic country, the EU is working in my best interest. However, I do get confused by socialists furiously defending the EU due to wanting to signal their animosity toward populists who tend to be anti-EU. They are defending a supranational construct built om liberal free market values that succesfully can overturn any of their socialist/anti-free market legislation deemed to go against EU law (which is heavily free market biased). 

Yes, EU legislation is voted on through parliamentary democracy, but for a country without any sway in the vote but sill just as much affected by it, you can see that it might go against the will of the people of that nation. Also, new directives have to abide by the higher norms, such as the TFEU which clearly states the free movement of people, products and capital, which of course makes anti free market legislation incredibly hard to pass.

Therefore, if I were a socialist or otherwise had bigger disagreement with the EU as a whole I would want my country to exit.

Because she is the mother of a Dutch citizen, she'd indeed be brought into the Netherlands... except that in that case Dutch law automatically would apply and it is VERY VERY easy for social services to deem her an unfit mother, taking the kid away (lest ""his family"" as she says, take him).

If she no longer is the legal guardian, she can lose all rights to residency in the Netherlands.

And not just that, it'd be VERY hard for him to acknowledge the child before birth considering he'd be arrested left and right for his crimes, but also the Netherlands holds the right to revoke citizenship *if* you were in a foreign army against the Netherlands (like...ISIS). This only works, however, if he holds ***literally any other*** passport. I have no clue if he does, but she does hold Bangladeshi citizenship (hence why the UK could easily strip her of her citizenship) so it might be possible the father does too.

2698,"Perception of what constitutes ""Central Europe"" has visibly evolved and shifted over the years but in recent years it seems to have settled into characterizing primarily the continuum of traditionally Catholic former Eastern Bloc countries that were otherwise historically and culturally a part of the Western world for more or less a thousand years by virtue of them belonging to Western Christendom and developing under its auspices, with Austro-Germanic influences front-and-center. 

Big Momma Austria must also be included for obvious reasons. However, Germany, which was historically the nucleus of Mitteleuropa, seems to have ""shifted"" from Central into Western Europe since ""Central Europe"" wasn't really a thing during the Cold War, and that geopolitical perception of Germany has largely remained even after the fall of the Iron Curtain and reunification.

- From autosomal data our analyses on population structure revealed the absence of strong substructure within the Slovenian samples, although the samples came from different regions of the country. We discovered a strong affinity between Slovenians and Central-Eastern European populations such as Czechs and Hungarians.


- All Slovenian samples group together with Hungarians, Czechs, and some Croatians (“Central-Eastern European” cluster) 


- Analysis of the UPGMA tree based on the Fst matrix shows all Slovenian individuals clustering together with Hungarians, Czechs, Croatians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians 


- Five populations contributed to the “Eastern-European” cluster including Belarusians, Estonians, Lithuanians, Mordovians, and Russians. Western and South Europe is split into two cluster: the first (“Western European” cluster) includes all Spanish individuals, few French, and some Italians (North Italy) while the second (“Southern-European” cluster) groups Sicilians, Greeks, some Croatians, Romanians, and some Italians (North Italy).",,/r/europe/comments/asr94i/the_prevalence_of_y_dna_haplogroup_r1b_subclade/egwr66t/,DazzaVonHabsburg,1550700231

I understand that she isn't a sympathetic character but a government making one of their citizens stateless, whatever the reasons, sets a dangerous precedent. 

For example, if the justification for this is that she is eligible for the statehood of another nation then consider that all Jewish people are eligible for Israeli citizenship. If an anti-semitic government were to be elected then this could stand as precedent to remove statehood of British Jews.

2871,"&gt;**Russia strikes back**  
&gt;  
&gt;The demonstrations in Maidan had started at the end of November 2013 to protest against Yanukovych's refusal to conclude a comprehensive cooperation agreement with the EU. The Ukrainian President had only refused at the last moment, after considerable Russian pressure. The demonstrators did not want to deal anymore with the corrupt Ukrainian regime in which a number of oligarchs are also sitting at the control buttons.  
&gt;  
&gt;For Russia, however, something completely different is at stake, something that is not appreciated in Brussels. For Moscow, Ukraine is an essential buffer against the West. In the past, Russian President Putin had made it clear several times in unmistakable terms that Ukraine should never be included in NATO. And for the Kremlin, the Maidan uprising was a clear stepping stone for Ukraine's entry into the Western alliance.  
&gt;  
&gt;President Putin does not like anything at all about street revolutions that topple authoritarian leaders. His greatest fear is that something like this will ever happen to him in Russia. In Putin's view, the street revolutions are Western interventions to bring friendly regimes to power.  
&gt;  
&gt;The chaotic days in Kiev after the massacre on 20 February also offer the Kremlin a lot of ammunition. The constitutional procedure to depose the President was not followed. The takeover of Yanukovych is therefore an outright coup d'état for Russia. The EU has not made much effort to push through the agreement it had itself negotiated on the transfer of power.  
&gt;  
&gt;For Brussels, everything was overtaken by the facts because Yanukovych had simply fled. There was a power vacuum in Kiev that had to be filled in any case. And the only ones who could do that at that time were the leaders of the Maidan uprising. In fact, all the steps were approved by a large majority in the Ukrainian Parliament.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Annexation of the Crimea, war in East Ukraine**  
&gt;  
&gt;Russia reacts quite quickly. On the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea, Russian soldiers quickly control all strategic buildings and places. The soldiers come from the Russian base of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol. They are soldiers without insignia, covering their faces.  
&gt;  
&gt;Moscow denies any involvement, but Putin admits it a few weeks later. A slip of the tongue, or is it just because he is so proud? After all, the operation succeeds without many problems. The Crimea is annexed by Russia. But Putin immediately makes it clear that he does not shy away from a lie if it suits him.  
&gt;  
&gt;A similar operation is being set up in East Ukraine, but the Russians no longer operate in the first line here. Putin will no longer repeat the Crimea's mistake: this time he sticks to the script and Moscow continues to deny any involvement.  
&gt;  
&gt;What is clear, however, is that Russia is behind the uprising in the so-called People's Republics of Donetsk and Loegansk: the rapid acquisition of military resources by the separatists, such as the brand new, shiny military trucks I see in the rebel headquarters in Yenakievo. Officially everything has been conquered from the Ukrainian army but on the other side of the front line I had seen for myself with which dilapidated military trucks that army had to do it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Russian soldiers are regularly arrested by the Ukrainians. For Moscow they are on holiday and can do whatever they want in their spare time. All Russian soldiers who Moscow sends to East Ukraine have the official status of volunteer so that the link with the army is easy to deny.  
&gt;  
&gt;Occasionally, the OSCE observer mission with drones sees how entire military convoys cross the unguarded border between Russia and Ukraine via dirt roads. Now, five years later, the fronts are no longer shifting, but are still being shot almost daily. The war in East Ukraine has already cost the lives of more than 13 000 people.

At parts, the border passes through villages, meaning these villages are slowly coming under Russian control.

So in my opinion the whole concept of the EU is targeted at increasing integration to further the free trade. We can argue if free trade is a good thing or not - but I would say that creating a single, more homogeneous market is what makes EU work.

In the end British people want to remain more independent and have more local control of regulatory power. And in contrary to many people shitting on brexiters - I see this as a valid argument, because not everything is just about economical growth. But this runs against the concept that makes EU work (in my opinion) so separation is best for everyone.

The UK had their own migration of cheap labor long before that and independently of the EU. Furthermore they could have put restrictions on initial migration of new Eastern EU members, but they voluntarily chose not to, and they advocated for rapid expansion to the east as well.

&gt;so now we start to see violent protest arise all over eurppe, brexit, yellow vests, extreme left and extreme right are rising, the result of an undemocratic EU that ignores its citzens, it keeps pushing this austerity agenda even tough it never worked. the people are being punished for the gambling of their leaders time and time again, and now we see violence emerging.

The austerity agenda is a common delusion in the European circles, it's not like the EU members would have done differently without the EU. EU policy simply reflects the dominant political ideas among its members. The UK too had its own austerity programme, without EU forcing it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_government_austerity_programme

3131,"Dude I'm sorry but you really don't know what you're talking about.

At face value and in theory it sounds great, and as a political tool, it makes for a great buzzword. For the foreseeable future though, it will not and should not happen, and the UK opposed it for entirely valid reasons.

The CDSP has always had the goal of being humanitarian before being military. Therefore, creating some kind of a European Defence Force signals a massive move towards combat and territorial objectives, which is a fairly provocative move, and would simply stoke tensions with Russia rather than quell them.

Additionally, a European Army compromises NATO's principles. This is the reason that the US has traditionally (Trump aside) opposed it, because we already have NATO and creating a EDF could potentially lead to its breakup, in a worst case scenario. The reliance of many European countries, particularly in the former Soviet Bloc, on the US has lasted so long because it is beneficial to all.

Finally, and most importantly, the idea isn't practical. France and Germany have had a joint brigade since 1989, and it was only once partially deployed because the two couldn't agree on acceptable levels of risk which completely blocked any chance of deployment. And that's only two countries. The ""EU battle groups"" have been around since I think 2007, and again have never been deployed. Different nations have different foreign/defence/security policies and so won't agree on when and where to deploy them, and all it takes is one country to refuse and the entire operation is halted. Even if it gets the go-ahead, no country is willing to accept the deployment responsibility because that means accepting the costs.

The idea behind it is flawed and idealistic, has no regard for geopolitics, the goals of European militaries or the bigger picture. On top of that, every ""trial"" or similar run it's been given has failed and run into roadblocks that show how hideously impractical it is.",,/r/europe/comments/aslq83/five_years_have_passed_and_russia_is_still/egvl22m/,Flobarooner,1550671326

3133,"&gt;The accusations against the UCK? I call them lies, Williamson himself said that they concerned less than 10 people and didn't even manage to prove them. Oh and the only convicted UCK leaders are accused to have killed and tortured Albanian traitors and ennemy policemen, nothing about Serbian or macedonian civilians.

I don't know that much about UCK atrocities but I'm sure they happened. I'm especially skeptical that they only tortured Albanians because most Kosovar Albanians consider Gorani, and Bosniaks in Kosovo, as Albanians. And both of those minorities supported the Serbs.**But I was talking about the NLA**. They occupied ethnic Macedonian villages, took (and killed) Macedonian civilian hostages who were in those villages (which happened to be North of Kosovo where they are accused of trying to ethnically cleanse Macedonians from. 

&gt;About the census, I will try find back the very amusing ones where the Albanians are not even represented, or in a very foolish way since countrysides were not studied at all. And btw, I don't believe in any study led by a Communist country, let it be Yugoslavia or Albania.

The objective of the Yugoslav census was to record who was where for things like law enforcement and tax collection. Only recently have they become anything more.If Albanians were not counted in the Yugoslav census then they wouldn't have to pay tax.

No, ever since humans started to form larger groups that consisted of not just blood relatives, it actually started to make sense to defend (and even die for) this larger group. This is what became 'natural' in the sense of logical from the evolutionary perspective, because you and your family being members of these larger groups gave you a bigger shot at survival. Early humans who failed to form larger and cohesive groups were killed or enslaved by the humans that managed to do so.

3188,"&gt;All right, let me clarify: I think it's a small first step in the right direction. But since every big deal starts with a small first step in the right direction, I'm all in favour of it; particularly given the fact that the Council (i.e. the states) have long resisted it.

It's certainly a step.. But, don't you think that the right direction here would be one that comes from EU citizens, there is demand for a more democratic EU (across all institutions) and it does sometimes feel like the EP is playing at democracy given the way the EU is split in terms of powers.  I'd love to see a real EU wide consultation with teeth to deliver something. A small step would be to have a figure that really does represent the EU and gets there via a democratic process, and a process that on balance, most people see as a good one.. Pipe dream perhaps, but surely better than this odd dance that is currently happening, although you are right that the opposition from EU member states isn't helping there.

&gt;Initially, I'd hoped that a much bigger step be taken during this term: Getting rid of national lists and introduce truly European lists for MEPs. If I elect a European parliament as a European citizen, I certainly expect to be treated as one.

Yeah, it seems like a logical approach given the normal approach in most EU member states, I'd see it as a little odd (and frankly, I love the constituency link that the UK has, even if I'd like some way of keeping that while getting election outcomes closer to being proportional..). 

&gt;Precisely. It almost appears as though all this talk about the ""democracy deficit"" were nothing but yet another fig leaf to dish it out on the EU ...

It doesn't just come from the anti-EU side though, where are the federalists on this? Where are those that want to argue the positive aspects of this for the EU? Where on earth are the detractors. Ah well.

3302,"&gt; it hit the West coast particularly hard but spared the rest of it comparatively.

Well, let me be clear - not *all* of Africa was well-established kingdoms. There were admittedly large areas that were much less developed (partly due to sparse population *(Africa is fuckin HUGE)* and vast areas of difficult lands for agriculture to develop) and had not yet caught up in terms of statehood by the time the slave trade began.

Interestingly, *West* Africa (particularly the Niger and Congo river basins) was the region with some of the most established nation-states on the continent. There are geographic factors at play which hindered the formation of kingdoms/economies in other parts of the continent.

So in a sense, by destabilising West Africa significantly, slavery actually damaged the most advanced part of the continent, leaving little hope for the rest of the landmass to catch up. I'm summarising this in *very* brief terms but there's a lot of academic literature on how slavery affected African long-tern economic potential.

---

&gt;  Furthermore, how can an entire continent with ""sovereign, well-governed nations"" and standing armies (that you think were up to par with European powers)

Well, first, you must remember that *slavery* and *colonialism* were two rather separate events. Slavery ran from late 1400s to early 1800s (over which time some 12 million Africans were shipped away). The full-scale colonial ""Scramble for Africa"", in which the entire continent was conquered, took place in the 1880s. Up until that point, there really hadn't been much inland conquest by the Europeans, they'd mostly just set up trade posts around the coasts.

So we're really talking about two separate events, which took place over very different periods of both African and European development. It is not a contradiction.

&gt; They were easy to enslave precisely because they had no major institutions or organization to do anything about it, and many of them were selling off ""their"" own people (tribes they had conquered)

Actually, much of the initial enslavement was done by Europeans *in cooperation with and thanks to* the incumbent governments and institutions. Africa had its own internal kingdoms and those kingdoms had rivalries, just as in Europe.

If aliens had landed in Europe in 1545AD during the Thirty Years War and said to France *""Hey, we'll give you these hovercraft and laser guns, all we ask in return is that you send us a few thousand prisoners from the other nations you defeat!""*, d'you think France would turn down that bargain? That's basically what happened in Africa, with the Europeans offering firearms in exchange for slaves.

So then every neighbouring tribe/kingdom needs to join this arms race and trade guns for slaves, lest they be defeated by their neighbours. And so it all breaks down.

Though to some degree there were also Europeans just going in manually and taking slaves by themselves. The King of Kongo wrote to the King of Portugal in 1526 asking him desperately to rein in the Portuguese who were marauding and taking Kongolese people as slaves *(the story of the Portugal-Kongo ""alliance"" is a really interesting one)*.

&gt; European historical literature of the time wasn't exactly glowing regarding African societies

In the initial discovery phase, there was plenty of writing by Europeans who were impressed by the works they discovered, or at least were not writing in derisory terms. I wouldn't be surprised to learn if racism developed *alongside* slavery, though that's not something I've studied.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/arva35/continents_with_total_wealth_smaller_than_italy/egv9q5m/,THREE_EDGY_FIVE_ME,1550656729

After some time, when Georgia became non-Russian aligned and Western aligned, Kremlin decided to back Abkhazia, and that also led to Abkhazia to be only backed by Russia and becoming dependent on it both militarily and economically, while it cutting ties with any other route including Turkey where majority of Abkhazians do reside since the Russian conquest and mass exile.

Parliament is sovereign. They chose...poorly.

If they had made an effort to choose someone that was competent enough to not start the race without having made sure to have a plan and a set of guidelines that was pre-approved by a substantial majority in the house of commons (60-70%), the process would have been smoother, predictable and stable.

Instead they chose a power hungry tory lojalist that, in an effort to placate *her party* elected morons, fired competent, essential experts and made herself dependent on extremists that caused her to promise everything to everyone.

Thus the parliament allowed the public to be misled and failed utterly in directing the public debate into the realm of *realistic expectations.* This is why there is a lot of ""ENGLAND BAD"" - the english public is seen as stubborn eat-the-cake-and-have-it-too.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/as8qp1/did_not_age_well/egv9u58/,AnonymityIllusion,1550656928

&gt; When Dominican police halted a flight in March 2013, the two pilots, Pascal Fauret, 58, and Bruno Odos, 59, as well as the two passengers, Alain Castany, 71, a former pilot and described as the “owner” of the suitcases, and Nicolas Pisapia, the “bag carrier”, were arrested. But the drama did not end there.

&gt; After a Dominican court sentenced the four men to 20 years in prison in August 2015, they were released and given leave to appeal while placed under house arrest.

&gt; Shortly afterwards, Fauret and Odos escaped with the help of friends in what they called “Operation Dîner en Ville” (dinner in town), making their getaway by speedboat then yacht to the French-Dutch island of Saint Martin and on to Fort-de-France, the capital of the French island Martinique. They arrived back in mainland France in the autumn of 2015, where they were arrested.

Nice logic.

What a stupid sentence, just conflating all colonization everywhere as equal in some misguided attempt to say ""colonialism doesn't matter"". I guess because Hong Kong and Singapore exists, that makes your words more legitimate, context be damned huh? Screw countries like Rwanda and the Congo. They don't matter because other countries that suffered are doing good now.

And the vast majority of countries that were formally brutally colonized aren't doing so hot. Large parts of India are shitholes (literally). Pakistan and Bangladesh are shitholes, despite some semi-prosperous areas.

But nah, Poland was devastated in a war (just like every other country involved in war) so we can extrapolate those results to colonialism in which the population was essentially enslaved. Because logic. Poland, which despite how much you want it to be true, never faced the same sort of brutal exploitation as some of these areas did.

So much so that granting enemy combatants your own citizenship as a loophole can be used to subvert many war crimes.

Citizenship should never be revoked for a crime and is a stupid political game to placate the masses who fail to understand what it is and think it's some kind of privilege; it isn't; it's an adminsitrative thing that is already enough of a mess that is used in international politics: in an ideal system stateslessness and dual citzenship would not exist and every single human being on the planet would be the citizen of exactly one country via an internationally standardized system and that's a place countries are trying to go towards with international agreements but that's not the current system alas and revoking citizenship for even high treason makes no sense because as said a state is more empowered to punish its own citizens in international law than the citizens of another country.",,/r/europe/comments/ase2j1/is_teen_to_lose_uk_citizenship_says_family/egv1ska/,des_heren_balscheren,1550644330

Because of 2 reasons

1- The Turks who migrated to Asia were around 20-40% Asian. They didn't have a universal asian look. Look at modern Turkmens for example. Some look Asian, most dont. Same here in Turkey. Except their Asian looking people look more Asian.

1- It's noise and does not mean that they actually have asian heritage

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kipchaks_in_Georgia

&gt;As a result of this diplomacy, 40,000 Cuman-Kipchak families under Otrak moved to settle in Georgia. According to the agreement, each Cuman-Kipchak family was to contribute a fully armed soldier to the Georgian army. They were given land, rearmed and became a regular force under the direct control of the king. Five thousand men were enrolled in the royal guards; the remainder were posted chiefly to frontier regions confronting the Seljuk Turks. They led a semi-nomadic way of life, wintering in the Kartlian lowlands in central Georgia, and carrying out their summertime duties along the foothills of the Caucasus.

&gt;The medieval compendium of the East Slavic chronicles known as Hypatian Codex relates that after the death of Vladimir Monomakh in 1125, Khan Syrchan of the Don Kipchaks, Otrak's brother, sent a singer to Otrak and asked him to return home. Legend has it that when Otrak heard his voice and smelled steppe grass, he became nostalgic for the steppe life and finally left Georgia.[2] Yet a number of the Kipchak mercenaries settled permanently within Georgia, converted to Orthodox Christianity, and integrated with the local population.

Approximately 40.000 Turkic families in Georgia converted to Christianity and joined the local communities. Maybe that's where their heritage comes from.",BVLL,/r/europe/comments/asdcwr/40_years_of_women_leaders_in_europe/eguk3ah/,Thephalanx23,1550628283

3750,"&gt;Approximately 40.000 Turkic families in Georgia converted to Christianity and joined the local communities. Maybe that's where their heritage comes from.

I'm not sure if the Cuman-Kipchak tribes had much Siberian mixture. Our Seljuk ancestors themselves didn't have as much Siberian admixture and they invaded the same time that Cuman-Kipchaks settled in Georgia, Russia, Ukraine and Hungary. 

In fact, couple hundred thousand ended up settling in Hungary (documented) but Hungarians largely have little to no East Asian ancestry. I have seen some historians try to claim that the ancestors of the Turks, who called themselves Aşına, are regarded to be of unknown ethnic origin but may have been Iranic or a mixture of groups. They began calling themselves Türük (strong) after they overthrew the Rouran Khaganate. The old Chinese seem to think we descended from the Dingling though, a people native to today's Mongolia. Of course though much of modern Mongolia was Turkic lands before Mongols conquered it and much of Central Asia was Turkic before we conquered it as a result of Tang China pushing us westward. 

Back to Siberia topic, ethnic groups like Kazakhs and Kyrgyz have large amounts of Siberian ancestry but I think it is partly because of heavy admixture with Mongols who invaded and conquered them during Golden Horde....

The best solution is not to strip them of their citizenship, that strips us of responsibility. If the country requests that they be extradited, we need to accept them. They are our failure.

If the country wants to prosecute them, and they request help, we can look at the evidence / hold a trial in absentia, and deny it.

As far as I know the words ""male"" and ""female"" have been used since forever to refer to human beings and that is their origin. They ultimately descent from the the Latin word ""mas"" and ""femina"" both of which referred to humans.

&gt; The problem appears when ""female"" is used to refer to human females, who have their own word, women.

Turns out synonyms exist... doesn't make the word bad. There's also a special word ""finger"" for primate front-paw digits but that doesn't mean that you can't call them ""digits"".

There are often search words, an infant human is often called a ""baby"", a infant cat is called a ""kitten""; that doesn't make the word ""infant"" inappropriate for humans just because a more specific word exists that is only used for humans.

&gt; Especially because the connotation is usually negative.

That's mostly something people invent; the difference is that ""male"" and ""female"" are _clinical_ terms that as such are often used in academic literature and laws.

And that still doesn't explain why people seem to lose their shit far more over ""female"" than ""male"" which I feel is just the same reason the word ""lady"" has been devalued considerably more than ""lord""; it's chivalry.",,/r/europe/comments/asdcwr/40_years_of_women_leaders_in_europe/eguacuv/,des_heren_balscheren,1550620740

So far I haven't heard Assad say that. And also the law does not work like that.

Of course she can now no longer make it to the UK so she may inevitably face the Syrian government's justice system soon enough and if anyone thinks that's a violation of her rights seriously has no idea how the world works.

3873,"&gt;We wouldn't have stripped her citizenship and palm her off onto another nation (say Ireland) that she'd never been to...

I'm inclined to believe that yes she would have. 

&gt;Ultimately if she made it back, unaided by the UK government, it would be a far more powerful message to have her imprisoned for life with her child removed and put into care, than whatever is going to happen now.

If she made it back it would be perfectly within the Syrian government's right to request her extradition back to Syria so she can face the death penalty or life in prison in Syria for her crimes against the Syrian people including genocide. 

When one commits a crime in a foreign country and then flees attempting to escape justice what often happens is an extradition request is invoked and depending on whether an extradition treaty is in place or not that person may or may not be extradited back to the country where they committed their crime to face justice. In this case that would be Syria. 

A simpler example? If I go to China now and rape someone I sure am not going to be allowed to go back to South Africa. You'll bet your arse I'll be sentenced in China and rightly so! Why should Shamima Begum be an exception?

The first three and the last item are pretty much all the same issue. Voter turnout is low because, shockingly, people don't easily fall into exactly two categories, and so they don't feel represented. And because of gerrymandering (which happens mainly because there are only two controlling parties) often their vote doesn't really matter. There are two parties in large part because of FPTP ([Duverger's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law)). Fix FPTP, you're halfway to fixing the other three issues, and probably helping with polarization which is another huge issue.

Money in politics is an issue but hardly our biggest, and it's not exactly an issue exclusive to the U.S.

Bigotry and anti-intellectualism feed with polarization but they're big issues as well. I think it's pretty hard to make the claim that Trump only won because of institutional issues; he also won because he exploited cultural issues.

Electoral reform and campaign finance reform are so hard because the people who can enact them are benefiting from the current system, so arguably the biggest issue is how Congress can't effectively reform itself.

Sure would be nice, but then the list of destinations would have to be on the left which is not intuitive.

8 is a banknote reader, not sure what 9 is supposed to be ... but i don't think it outputs anything.

Twice? What do you mean? The right column is for reduced price tickets.

&gt;there are two separate numpads instead of just the one

&gt;as for the destination list, I don't know how developed numeric letter mapping was, but it already existed, and could have been used (but I understand that a printout of the destination numbers was easier).

Numeric letter what? The machine didn't even have a display showing you what you typed when they were first used.

&gt;we're just amused that Germany was stuck using these for 50-odd years.

Outside of the parts with the Amazons WW didn't even pass the bechdell test and the entire film was a Smurfette principle except Smurfette was the title character but sure ""female"" is the same as ""feminist"" so it got called ""feminist"" for whatever reason; probably because it called itself that.

Like the (female) director was also asked what was up with those high heels and that swimsuit armour and came with an explanation of how it's important for females to ""feel sexy"" and shit; if a male had said the exact same thing the internet would have exploded over it but all you need to do to get pardoned for making pretty objectifying, and generalizing claims that hold females back and still be called ""feminist"" is to be female yourself and preface it with ""As a woman ..."" apparently; it's ridiculous/",,/r/europe/comments/asdcwr/40_years_of_women_leaders_in_europe/egtpm59/,des_heren_balscheren,1550606364

4051,"&gt; Suddenly? I've been saying this from the start and even before that with regard to referendum in general.

It was a general statement, not specific about you. Only after Remain lost did most people start demanding things like: a 2nd vote to check if opinions changed, 16-17 year old should have been allowed to vote, 3/5 should have been required, etc. Lets be honest, these people only want this now, because they dont like the result.

&gt; No, because general elections are a standard part of representative democracy. A referendum is something extraordinary that (a) shouldn't be used; (b) if it is used, provisions should be made so that the result is decisive and therefore legitimate.

So what if elections are part of representative democracy? The same logic should apply. We should ""make sure a clear majority of active voters oppose the status quo"" (the current government). If the ~~leavers~~ opposition can convince a clear majority of those who bother to vote, then by all means, have it their way (a new government). If I were super democratic, I'd stipulate that majority must support ~~leave~~ new government in all 4 constituent countries of the UK. 

This isnt about Brexit for me, if the roles were reversed I would be saying the exact same thing, but somehow I doubt most Remainers would. I completely disagree with your premise that referendums are something bad. Most, if not all criticism of them apply to elections as well.

Why farmland, because that's whats currently being done in The Netherlands. Besides solar on buildings all we can do is appropriate farmland into solarparks, which is why i said we have no space.

It's twofold consumption and production. We should all lower our energy consumption but we can't exactly not use energy, so what energy we use will still need to be produced. We should also recognize that the area's with the highest consumption usually are the least desirable for production. So yes technically there is enough space in The Netherlands to build solar panels and we definitely should appropriate some farmlands to a few solarparks. But should we fill our landscape with solar and sacrifice what little ""nature"" we have for thousands of people or focus more on production in the middle of nowhere corners of Europe?

So, it'll get even better? 

It's amazing how the same people who have been consistently wrong on everything keep changing with no shame whatsoever.

The economy was supposed to tank after the referendum - and spare me the ""nobody said that"" because my job at the time was literally to read and analyze macro forecasts and I recall reading those, as well as reading all the corrections months later.

Then it was supposed after the invocation of Article 50.

Now it's after Brexit.

Fearless prediction: after Brexit happens, people like you will say ""just wait till there's a definitive deal"" or something like that.

The main driver for the recession used to be ""uncertainty"" (which was never more than voodoo economics). Now, all of a sudden, the main driver will be certainty (the same type of voodoo economics sold to the same type of know-nothing simpletons).

It's amazing the fanaticism of partisans like you. It's exactly how described in a splendid book called The Righteous Mind. 

Mind, when Republicans were trying to pass fiscal reform, those opposed to it literally claimed [people were going to die because of it](https://freebeacon.com/politics/list-times-democrats-claimed-gop-policies-cause-people-die/)

It was claimed repeatedly that it wouldn't make wages grow (against the overwhelming academics consensus that corporate income tax is hugely important for wage growth as workers pay a large share of the corporate tax in the form of lower salaries). Now that people who defended the tax reform bill are being proven right (by wage growth, capital investment growth, the variations in actual tax revenue - pretty much everything), none of that matters. The attitude is like ""let's just keep saying things are horrible and just ignore the actual numbers and metrics"". 

More amazing - what that other fanatic /u/jreiland07 pointed out was ""the damage both are doing"". As factually there is no damage to see whatsoever, you have to resort to ""wait and see"". But that's only because I made a comment - otherwise the flow of comments ""look at the damage Brexit and Trump"" are doing will go undeterred, even if in the absence of any evidence whatsoever. This sub has become a mirror of /r/conspiracy, with people writing comments on how the UK economy is in shambles in the same day they record the highest employment numbers since recorded history and plenty suggesting the numbers are fake.

4137,"&gt; It’s not that simple. 

of course it is, it's a simple label, words and ink

&gt; If you mandate something like this, that means you now have to have regular government inspections, retooling of plant equipment, redesign of labeling, etc. There are increased costs of production, which will be passed on to the consumer.

just like it already happens with other kinds of labeling. Corporations need not pass the cost to the consumer necessarily, and they're already inspected on related grounds (quality, sanitation, etc...).

&gt; Why should everyone have to pay higher food prices to accommodate you? 

why should the industry be carnist by default and opt for unclear lists of ingredients?

&gt; Besides the point, almost all food that caters to vegans/vegetarians is already voluntarily labeled as such because that’s their target market! This isn’t about ideology, it’s overkill that will increase costs so you can feel better.

No, the point is that the criteria for the lists changes from country to country and the lists are also sometimes ambiguous. Furthermore, printing a label that explicitly says it contains products from animal origin, is as simple as printing the expiration date.

&gt; And what in the world is carnism? Is that another word for eating like how a human evolved to eat?

Your [appeal to nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature) does not refute the use of the term carnism. Carnism is the opposite of veg(etari)anism and denotes a choice of including animals in your diet. Simple as that.

It’s due to the Japan-EU trade deal and the global decline in car sales along with new taxes on diesel vehicles.

Both Honda and Nissan have said it’s due to the lower import tariffs due to the EU-Japan trade deal making it more economically viable to move manufacturing back to Japan, China and Malaysia.

Another point is that Honda and other car companies are struggling currently due to global downturn in car sales along with the massive drop in Japanese car sales in Europe.

No manufacturing has moved to other countries in Europe, 3 car plants in Turkey have also been suspended due to the global downturn and the new EU deal. 

Brexit has caused uncertainty in terms of the future entry in the European market but the moves aren’t just spontaneous from Brexit, they have been planned since the trade deal has been signed.

Member states can protect borders very well if their efforts are not hampered by NGOs and EU bureaucrats. Giving more power to Juncker and Commission over birders would never be about border protection but about implementing Commission policies so it means increased immigration.

We give asylum to war criminals under the pretext that they face prosecution, we incentivize throwing away documents and lying about age, we even allow NGOs to provide instructions and legal help in circumventing the immigration system.

Go read an economics textbook instead of believing reddit and the guardian. 

Here's a very anti-Brexit economist, and a very left-wing one, explaining why those predictions of recessions and whatnot were absolute nonsense:

https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/the-macroeconomics-of-brexit-motivated-reasoning/?module=BlogPost-Title&amp;version=Blog%20Main&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;action=Click&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body

I still disagree with him about Brexit's impact on the long-run  but at least he was honest to admit Brexit wouldn't simply create a recession.

4456,"&gt;  Trump supporters give a fuck about him keeping his promises to them. 

Trump has already broken a lot of promises, and very few of them are being discussed at all. Anyone who discusses them are dismissed as ""the left"" or ""triggered liberals"". The celebrity culture that exists in the US massively influences politics, Trump and Obama are great examples of that. 

A quote from Vox, not the most reliable site for information but they have citation on everything. [Here](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/18/17990626/trump-promises-made-promises-broken)

&gt;As a candidate, Trump promised to raise taxes on the rich; as president, he promised tax changes that at a minimum wouldn’t benefit the rich.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trump promised to break up America’s largest banks by reinstated old Glass-Steagall regulations that prevented financial conglomerates from operating in multiple lines of business.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trump promised price controls on prescription drugs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trump promised to “take the oil” from Iraq to reduce the financial burden of US military policy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trump promised many times that he would release his tax returns and promised to put his wealth into a blind trust.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trump vowed rollback of climate change regulations but said he was committed to upholding clean air and clean water goals.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trump promised a $1 trillion infrastructure package.

Aside from the second to last promise, which is too subjective to claim he has broken, these are very serious things Trump has promised. None of which have been achieved. 

Ultimately all Trump has done is the folliwng

* Trade war with China
* Easing of embargos on Russia
* Tax cuts, mostly for corporations and wealthy individuals
* Improve southern border control

The debt in the US is skyrocketing under Trump, the next president is going to have to raise taxes and cut spending significantly. Ironically this is the opposite of what the Republicans used to be known for. ",,/r/europe/comments/as8qp1/did_not_age_well/egso1bk/,Pekkis2,1550578081

A good way to force it would be a pollution tax. Lower VAT so overall tax burden stays the same. The more pollution something creates over it's lifetime the higher the tax.

Were right now or make sense to ship shrimps to China to peel them because it's cheaper, it would be offset by the tax now. Electric cars would be way cheaper, waste would be reduced, etc.

Any other way is just full of loopholes or companies just move to a different country to avoid it.

4493,"There are many reasons which can explain Berlusconi and, in turn, Forza Italia's slow fall.

That party is built around Berlusconi's figure. If he dies, that party dies with him. Thus some people have already left the sinking ship to join Salvini who is the leader of the right coalition. 

Berlusconi is now old and his communication outdated. In his first political years, his use of TV, radios and newspapers (some were his, so it was pretty simple) was revolutionary and successful. His first [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8-uIYqnk5A) is a perfect example. He oozed charisma and promised a ""liberal revolution"", to wipe out the corrupted and inept politicians (Some claim Berlusconi was the first populist in Italy).

But that type of communication has no place in 2019. It's no coincidence that the two biggest forces (M5S and Lega) happen to be the most active on social medias and online.

Also Berlusconi hasn't the charm he used to have. Back then he was a successful businessman (Mediolanum, Mediaset and many others assetts were soaring, Milan was winning titles left and right). He looked like King Mida. How can't you trust such a successful businessman?

4494,"&gt;The Harry S. Truman CSG and Iwo Jima ARG regularly patrol the North Sea. They pack as much firepower as the air forces of the V4 and the Baltic states combined. And those are just the ones which the US spends to Europe. It has nearly two dozen such groups.

Good luck stopping a Russian land offensive with a few ships... You do realize that Russia has a logistical advantage, they have air defense, they have air-forces, have their own navy (which is no match for US, but still...) and Baltic Sea is something they are ready to defend as fiercely as possible? 

It doesn't happen just like that... Russia is not Iraq in 2003. It's the second strongest military on the planet. US has not fought against even remotely equal opponents in recent history, and nothing implies that they're as invincible as the general consensus seems to be... There is NO WAY they would rush in to defend Poland, or at least the Baltics. 

&gt;The result for the Russians would be similar to when they attacked US forces in Syria. In short, a lot of dead ""green men"" which Moscow will pretend never existed.

He was a sort of annonciation of our Macron, and make no mistake, Macron will fail too.   
Why? It has nothing to do with the personality and political posture but the core of their ideology and policies. Centrist social democracy colored with TINA policies has become not just innefective but harmful to the economy and society as a whole. It slowly destroys it, destroy social links, destroy structures of solidarities, increase precarity.  
That's why it is bolstering populism ( I hate this blurry word ).  


Well then there is also the whole buzz with immigration and so on but I think it's just something that add weight, nothing much.  
TL ; DR Our societies have become dysfunctionnal, the economy is not working anymore and centrist TINA policies like Renzi's and Macron's are making it worse.

The general consensus is that the current government will not last until the end of its mandate, though neither Salvini nor Di Maio wish to be seen as the one responsible for the break up, so it might take them some time to find a legitimate casus belli.

At the moment, the most likely outcome seems that, when the current government does fall, there will be new elections, and Lega will win comfortably and form a government with smaller right wing allies, possibly including Berlusconi, thus giving Italy its most right wing government since 1943. But the economy is in poor health, and it is expected to get worse, meaning that some of the consensus enjoyed by Lega could be eroded in the mean time.

Another important factor will be the fate of PD: will they finally get their act together, choose a capable leader, and agree on a program that attempts to address the challenges that we are facing? Will Renzi break up with PD and form his own Macron-style party?

Until you look at numbers, like California where  according to the very EPA,  [exponential renewable growth](https://i.imgur.com/4zAf52V.png) had near zero effect on their in state [CO2/kWh](https://i.imgur.com/ch7Sk8Y.png). 

I'm failing to see your point here and it just looks like a red herring. There is a direct correlation between solar energy density of an area and the actual energy produced for a solar panel. Meanwhile emissions has many more variables. For example in the graph you shown the ""exponential growth"" happens at the same time as a collapse in Nuclear and Hydro which is why the emissions largely flatline. Just like German emissions have similarly largely flatlined. But that has nothing to do with the fact that the sun shines more brightly in America than it does in Germany.

On the other hand, 34% stated that health care costs were somewhat of a financial burden, while 11% perceived such costs as a heavy financial burden on the household budget.

Medical care refers to individual health care services such as examinations or treatments. It includes health care for curative, rehabilitative or long-term purposes, mental medical health care as well as preventive medical services. Dental care and medicines are not included.

At EU level, the perceived financial burden of medical care was greatest for those living in two-person households that included at least one person aged 65 years or more (13% of people in these households reported medical care to be a high financial burden). Those living in single-person households (12%), households without dependent children (12%), two-adult households and in households with dependent children (both 10%) also reported that health care was a high burden on their budget.

Cyprus had the largest share of persons reporting that health care costs posed a high financial burden (39%), followed by Bulgaria (32%), Italy (29%) and Latvia (28%).

In contrast, 79% of people in Denmark and 77% in the Netherlands and Sweden stated that these costs caused no financial burden on the household.

Calling Israel a Jewish state when it has non-Jewish natives is MASSIVE discrimination and there are countless laws that benefit Jews specifically over everyone else.

I can't deny though that German EU policy has been horrible. The German leadership lacks vision and courage, also diplomatic talent. It puts the German electorates opinion and interests first which is very short sighted while also pretending like they are these big Europeans. I have lost some hope these past few years. At the moment it looks like the EU is breaking apart, or at best staying an impotent facade. The coming recession will not be kind to the EU.

Furthermore US could never have destabilize the EU to a degree which self centered German policy makers have.

This is false. The plans when it comes to NS and NS2 haven't been made on a short notice. 

This is the outcome of at least decade of planning and implementation of many different German governments, ruling in between now and then and Russia.

This has absolutely nothing to do with Poland being more or less ""closely aligned"" with Germany.

Germany has nothing to say about Russian interference, when they close the deal, already. They are just the receiving end.

SOURCE: https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/who-theresa-may-cabinet-boris-hammond-rudd

The media are overwhelmingly pro leave.

You really have to classify what you mean by ""media""; as the largest media organisation, the BBC, is very often to be criticised for being biased to ""REMAIN"". 

- ""BBC was not impartial during Brexit referendum, ITV's Robert Peston says"" - [LINK] (https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/bbc-bias-brexit-eu-referendum-reporting-robert-peston-itv-a8571946.html)
- ""BBC FLAGSHIP SHOWS STILL HAVE REMAIN PANEL BIAS"" - [LINK] (https://order-order.com/2018/10/05/bbc-flagship-shows-still-remain-panel-bias/)

And the print media has always been split on the issue:

LEAVE:

- Daily Express
- Daily Mail
- Daily Telegraph (&amp; The Sunday Telegraph)
- Sunday Express
- The Sun (&amp; The Sun on Sunday)
- The Sunday Times

REMAIN:

- Daily Mirror
- Financial Times
- The Guardian (&amp; The Observer)
- The Mail on Sunday
- The Times

But yes, the 3 papers with highest UK circulations (The Sun, Daily Mail &amp; The Sun on Sunday) were LEAVE supporters.

5107,"&gt; uring the Iraq war, Germany and France openly opposed the UK/US narrative. Thus, it was not possible to pretend that the narrative was correct because all allies agreed. Still, the narrative was so powerful that it led to war.

No, that's not correct. The states who didn't want to participate, didn't.

&gt;Today, there is no more opposition to the war faction. 

The Wars against Iraq, ISIS, and Assad are three different conflicts. The first was only the USA and two or three others, the second was a broad coalition, and the third wasn't really started yet apart from some proxy support during the ISIS conflict.

&gt;While Delmas was still able to say that France would not participate in a British plan to topple Assad in 2009, Laurent Fabius had already bought into the regime change narrative as Hollande's FM.

What makes you think that verbal support is in any way comparable to actual military support?

&gt;Once you buy into the regime change narrative because you have no choice as Nato member, you have no choice but to defend the narrative against all odds.

&gt;Just look at Merkel how she's desperate to defend that war in Afghanistan, even though the best we can hope for at this stage is that the Taliban will take the country back.

Afghanistan is a fourth different conflict, stop trying to amalgamate everything. It was the only time in history that NATO's mutual defense clause was actually activated, so of course everyone was going to honor that call - justifiably so after 9/11 (formally claimed by Bin Laden), in my opinion, even if there's a lot to say about the actual war goals and/or their execution (pun not intended but why not :)).

5121,"I didn't agree with you on what should be the reaction of Poland to this whole crisis, but I agree with you on this. It's easy to blame Israel for the situations that Palestinians find themselves in, it's tempting to symphatize with the weaker side, but to actually function in Israel's geopolitical reality is quite hard. 

And the reality is that the Arabs have repeatedly started and lost wars with Israel, that they got their Palestinian neighbours into this shit situations and that the Palestinians themselves had several opportunities to reach a solid deal with Israel that would give them their own indepedent country. They threw every opportunity away because they could not give up any of their maximalist demands.

Till today they refuse to accept that they have the weaker cards. They continue living in their fantasy land where some ideal deal will land in their lap and they will be given everything they had in 1948. Some of them would even want more than that (read - kick all Jews out of there and destroy the country of Israel completely). It's absolutely detached from reality.

With this approach they managed to convince the other party, i.e. the Israelis, that there will be no compromising with them. That no peace deal will be happening. Israelis even tried unilateraly giving them some land. What the result of that is we can see in Gaza. So yes, nowadays Israelis occupy a large part of the Palestinian land. And yes, there are abuses of power and yes, there is a double standard applied there, Palestinians are discriminated in almost every possible way compared to the settlers.

But one should not forget how we got here. Palestinians simply reap the consequences of convincing their much stronger rival that they will never agree with any reasonable compromise and that whatever concessions Israel offers, they will eventually use it against them.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/arw8sn/the_latest_poland_pulls_out_of_israel_meeting/egrbiay/,kristynaZ,1550527384
5122,"&gt;Or you want to say that if any violence from Red Army continued Baltic States would still use ""non-violence"" approach? 

Yes. That was the plan all along. The moment Baltic states would have used the violence all would have been lost as it would have given Soviets an excuse to step up the crackdown, while  if protesters remain peaceful Soviets couldn't commit and save face. Not talking that propaganda about willing union would have been thrown out of the window.

&gt;standing and singing in front of tanks works only if other party is unwilling to commit

People were crushed under tanks and shot. So no, it works even if the other side is commiting. It shows determination  and makes look those commiting atrocities very, very bad which has consequences where international relations are concerned - there was pressure from other countries to stop bloodshed. 

Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine all regained independence through peaceful means. There was another peaceful and one not so peaceful revolutions in Ukraine too. The mistake these countries made is they did not use the chance they got wisely and while the Baltic countries made reforms and tried to curb Russian influence wherever possible, when it was possible, these countries did not. Instead of cutting off the ties there was cooperation, joining various economic unions and alowing to be manipulated and provoked. They are paying the price now. Neither war in Georgia nor Ukraine was a direct result of independence movement. Independence was achieved without violence in these countries, at least without violence from the part of those seeking independence.

I think that calling ECR a party which doesn't seek federalisation but preservation of the EU and further integration that doesn't impact member states' sovereignty, take that as you will. They're anti EU army, but pro increased defence spending and military expansion and further cooperation to make the EU to be a formidable opponent for anyone who would dare to threaten it with military action.

""The geopolitical situation in Europe is changing and therefore Member States the greater need to cooperate on their common security. We have started hearing more and more about the “strategic autonomy” of Europe or the creation of a “European army”. But we shouldn’t lose touch of reality - these are only ideas and something that could only ever happen in the distant future, if at all.""

Now, is it possible it could be used against us? Maybe, but Russia wouldn't be able to do it alone, Germany would have to cooperate in trying to screw us but thus far it hasn't happened and it doesn't seem likely. 

It doesn't matter what you believe is likely or not. 
These decisions aren't made up by to the next elections and Nord Stream isn't something that you can suddenly dismantle. How are you going to replace the gas contractors and distributors, all of the sudden?

There are people, experts in their respectable fields, that are handling the subject of internal and external security for years now. Ask anyone and they will tell you that Nord Stream is a disaster in a long term.

You can't guarantee that Germans won't vote some Putin-leaning, warmongering politician to the power or that one will take the power, through some other chain of events. Nothing is politically set in stone. 

**Except the infrastructure.**. And everything good and bad that comes with it.

Radosław Sikorski (from Civic Platform) that I wouldn't call a ""far-right"" politician went as far as to say that ""Nord Stream is a new Ribbentrop-Molotov pact"".

Nord Stream 2 is even worse as it goes around Ukraine (which was balancing the gas deficits with some other gas links, from other countries than Russia) and can be used as a weapon against the whole Central Europe.

&gt;Take note that the topic of Nord Stream is not even brought up by the state media even though PiS was very vocal about it whenever it came up in the past. It just serves as a ""beware of the Germans"" type of message once in a while and nothing is really being done about it, besides an occasional protest from a lone politician.

What you are referring to isnt capitalism, its imperialism. There is a inherent and defining difference: consent. Any transaction made (whether sales or employment) are effectively the same thing: A consentual trade of products or services that can only happen if both sides are consenting and agree on the conditions. If you can generate a network of consentual agreements that will cause you to have a lot of resources theres no problem with your wealth.

This is what the free market is. Government adds violence and unconsentual transactions into the equation. In a free market system without government intervention (as long as transactions are voluntary and not coerced) everyone gets what they deserve.

*The only welfare I support is for the disabled and children.

5244,"&gt;Its really not very different from thinking you wouldn’t be compatible with a workaholic or a person of a different political party. You don’t necessarily think they are a bad person, you just aren’t compatible.

Well thats not the point of the conversation though. Original post said he hated the fact Czech women were having sex for money on camera. This guy responded and said there's nothing wrong with it but wouldn't date one. Let's say the subject was workaholics.

User 1;""I hate the way men are workaholics in my country""

User 2:""there's nothing wrong with it""

User 1; ""would you date a workaholic""

User 2; ""no way but if he was perfect I would""

That's how that conversation progressed. The way I see it is user 2 thinks other people should date those girls but not him. There's nothing wrong with it as long as it doesn't affect his family or is own relationship.  I just think it's a cop out.


&gt;Another projection. Nearly everyone who didn’t meet their SO in grade school’s SO had previous partners. Shall we always worry how we compare with their past partners or just be satisfied knowing they chose us?

Who's getting defensive and projecting now?

How can you possibly compare have sex for money on camera with a stranger for the world to see, with someone having a relationship in the passed? Apple's and oranges.


&gt;Have you never heard of forgiveness? Not sure if you’re Christian but if so, remember Mary Magdalene the literal prostitute cum disciple of jesus? Do you not allow that people can change or grow as people?  

People are their actions and people are their passed. If someone's passed bothers you or if they've done something shitty to you, you're not under pressure to forgive,  more time is needed until you forget about it.



&gt;He need not consider polygamy immoral to not practice it himself. Values, once again, are different from morality. I value friends and family above work, but someone who thinks otherwise is not morally reprehensible to me. I enjoy humor, but being super serious is not immoral imo. I want to have an exclusive relationship with my partner and to not sleep around, but do not think open relationships or people who sleep around are morally wrong.

That's a shitty strawman argument. You're purposefully comparing  something so obviously innocent to something that is comparatively not. I can do that too with things

I value friends and family above (killing people), but someone who thinks otherwise is not morally reprehensible to me. I enjoy humor, but being a  (serial killer) is not immoral imo.

Well obviously morals are an abstract thing, but to downvote the shit out of a guy because  sex on camera being so prevalent with the woman of his country disappoints him. Then to turn around and say you wouldn't date one because you have different ""values"" but maybe if they were perfect is total bs and hypocrisy.

&gt; Everything you said before this point I can tolerate, but this is too much. 'The Dutch' didn't send anyone to their deaths. This would be the same as saying that the concentration camps were Polish. You had the NSB and other collaborators but you didn't have a widespread effort by the Dutch to cleanse the country of jews.

&gt; Give a source for the 'relatively small numbers'.

""the LKP (""Nationale Knokploeg"", or National Force Units, literal translation ""Brawl Crew""). This was one of the largest resistance groups, numbering around **550 active participants**; "" [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_in_World_War_II#Dutch_resistance)

We'll always need some flexible capacity and/or storage, so why not use it to enable renewables instead of nuclear?

Tariffs for night and day is common practice among any source of energy, I don't see how you can make consumer convenience consuption during daytime equivalent to the wind blowing into the turbines or lack thereof

&gt;This is actually a downside to nuclear energy, another bottleneck in the production and rollout. Wind turbine producers and maintainers are more easily found and trained, and that will actually reduce unemployment, while there's already plenty of demand for engineers.

You are basically implying that people with engineering degree are jobless which is a joke in itself. They can find jobs anywhere notleast being confined by wind production. As for maintainers they are paid less than nuclear ones and he was talking about the effect on the economy so higher wage is better for the economy not east if you take into account the the amount of people working in maintenance for wind will not be much higher if any higher than those in nuclear plants especially due to strict maintenance rules in nuclear power plants",Europe,/r/europe/comments/arw5t7/european_parliament_seat_projection/egqhdof/,Freedom_for_Fiume,1550505863

Someone from the German French border might be more genetically similar to most French people than to most German people, but be ethnically German. Being ethnically German doesn't necessarily mean they have German nationality though, just like it doesn't automatically make them German citizens. For example there are ethnic Germans in Latin America.

America, Canada or Australia are nations in the sense that they are states, the two are in this way synonymous. In the USA at least, there are significant cultural differences between different regions and groups, so they can be considered different ethnicities, as opposed to simply 'American', while all being American nationals and citizens, although some people are only US nationals, but not US citizens. I'm Australia it may be fair to separate Australians of European origin as a separate ethnicity from the aboriginals who hold on to their culture, but the aboriginals are of course Australian nationals.

National as used in national income does not refer to ethnicity, but legal nationality. However, in practice it measures wealth possessed by all citizens, not all nationals. Not that there's much of a difference in modern democracies.

True, but this was not on the behest of any polish politician. The Aktion Reinhardt camps were put in remote areas of Poland, and only Auschwitz with his huge camp complex (maybe the biggest of them all) was in a more populated area. The Nazis chose those probably for 3 reasons: 1.) to set up extermination sites close to the polish and russian jews, 2.) to have them outside of Germany 3.) to be in the general government/occupied territories and out of any possible interference by judges or regional party leaders.

&gt; The vast majority of the population was antisemitic even though they weren't too fond of the Nazis to say the least.

I dunno if it was a ""vast majority"", a ""big minority"" or else, but yes, there were a lot antisemites in Poland. But the polish were also of all nations of Europe the one who was targetted by both the Nazis and the Soviet Union, and subject of genocidal and ""educational"" methods by both of them after 1939.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/18/israel-eurovision-propaganda-oppression-palestinians

&gt;April last year, Israel’s snipers targeted and killed journalists who were filming the **peaceful** protests in Gaza.

Killing an unarmed journalist is a crime and it needs to be investigated. Israel does that and its soldiers have been sentenced for murders. In Palestine however, terrorists that target civilians are celebrated as martyrs.

Is there crimes that go unpunished? Absolutely, that happens in every armed conflict. We don't often even hear about warcrimes US has committed in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen etc. until much later when some whistleblower leaks the information out.

Calling the protests last year peaceful is completely dishonest. Whenever there's a big protest or public gathering like that in Gaza, Hamas will be there to take advantage of it. And [tires were not burned for no reason](http://k6s3v6r4.ssl.hwcdn.net/pictures/825/825702.jpg) but to create a smokescreen to make it difficult for IDF to tell who were Hamas attackers and who were civilians.

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hamas-says-most-protesters-killed-israel-gaza-were-members-n874906
&gt;Salah Bardawil, a senior Hamas official, told Palestinian news outlet Baladna TV that 50 out of the 60 who died on Monday were members of his organization, while the rest were civilians. Hamas won elections in 2006 and has run Gaza since the end of a violent power struggle the following year.

&gt;Israel has long argued that Hamas has used the protests, which began on March 30, as cover to for terrorist attacks or attempts to infiltrate its border.

That being said, (a) I'm not sure that they have broken German law sufficient to be handed down a life sentence, and (b) Germany generally is not into life sentences (or, by US standards, long prison sentences in general).  So that may not be realistic to expect Germany to do.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment_in_Germany

&gt; In Germany, a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment (*lebenslange Freiheitsstrafe*) normally may apply for parole after having served 15 years. If the parole court rejects the application, the inmate may reapply after a court determined blocking period no longer than two years (§ 57a IV StGB). If the court has determined a ""severe gravity of guilt"" exists (*besondere Schwere der Schuld*), parole is delayed for a non-specific period beyond 15 years (§ 57a StGB).

-

&gt; The German Constitutional Court has found life imprisonment without the possibility of parole to be antithetical to human dignity.

&gt;And if a majority of people want to depose their government, they absolutely have that right.

Do a 30% of the seats have a right without any Law to support them to organize their own vote to depose the government? Can a city initiate a referendum that could alter the national constitution? That's not democratic at all.

Defending everything under 'votes' and 'majorities' without any democratic Law to support it as as undemocratic as you can get. No matter how much you try to disguise it with fancy words, you are just defending that a mob should have the final say on everything and the rest should shut the fuck up and accept it. I hope you enjoy trying to live in a society like that. 


&gt;So we agree Spain is not a democracy? It clearly uses the law as a barrier.

Yeah, thanks again for twisting my words. Spanish Law is not a barrier, but a guarantee. I guess you also could say that France is not a democracy, since it's Constitution does explicitly forbid any reform that would allow the separation of any of its territories, while Spain just asks for a super-majority.

5769,"Here's why IP laws make rigorous experimentation possible.

The average drug takes ~12 years and ~$5bn in R&amp;D to get from discovery to approval for sale. Without IP protections, there would be minimal advantage to the discoverer (on average, drug discoverers lose ~95% of their market share within 5 years of a drug going off patent).

Without patent protections, a company who spend $5bn developing a drug will always be undercut by a company which takes their already registered drug and manufactures it without paying them. 

Good science costs money, and lots of it. The synthetic chemists working to discover candidates, to the biologists screening them, the chemical engineers working out how to scale up the process, the analytical chemists telling them whether there's anything dangerous in there, the clinical organisers and staff who recruit patients and oversee the testing all need wages, premises and equipment to do their jobs. 

But let's take an example drug to explain the issue with this 'government will fix it' idea.

Approximately 1 in 140,000 babies are born with Pompe disease. It is fatal without treatment.

Genzyme (now owned by French pharma giant Sanofi) spent a lot of money working on . For those governments and healthcare providers who can afford it, it is one of the most expensive drugs on the planet ($300,000 per year). For many who can't in poorer countries the drug is provided by Sanofi's charitable foundations (in part because it really doesn't change cost of production much and there's no point denying treatment to people who could never hope to afford it, and in part because they can write off the contributions against taxes)

Which government do you imagine would fork out $5bn to stop those deaths? Are 3 deaths a year in the UK worth $5bn of British taxpayer's money? Are 27 of the 3.86 million births in the USA going to pry that huge chunk of cash away from more pressing issues like building pointless walls or maintaining enough nukes to kill the planet an extra 5 times?

5772,"&gt; We're specifically talking about the version adopted in parliament.

You were mentioning that version, that doesn't mean the whole thread is now about that specific version. It would be disingenuous to have a lengthy discussion on an obsolete proposal.

&gt; Not the speculative version that hasn't been released. 

But it has been released by Julia Reda. If you think she's lying or unreliable as a source, please share some insights where she did ruin her reputation. She's biased, but the text she published as ""final wording of Article 11 and Article 13"" in this context is not a matter of opinion. It's either factually correct or wrong.

&gt; Furthermore, platforms have an incentive to keep user submissions online. It earns them money. It's their entire business model. This directive wouldn't change that. 

That's not entirely wrong, but not accurate, either. The business model is to earn more by serving advertisement (or by paid subscriptions or - theoretically at least - fees paid by the publisher) than paying out in royalties and penalties. That model doesn't change, but one of the metrics might change substantially.

&gt; If platforms decide they refuse to remunerate right holders for stolen content they have profited from, quite frankly, that platform doesn't deserve to exist. 

The problem is that the platform does not know in advance, which material users are going to use. They are liable to acquire licenses before publishing, i.e. they need to acquire licenses to each and every copyrighted work in order to be compliant in case a user uses such a work (Art. 13, 4). 
4a clarifies that proportionality of costs for implementation for the provider shall be taken into account, but 4aa sounds specifies that this should apply specifically for companies doing business less than 3 years in EU (and having turnaround of 10Million or less). This basically removed the provision the EP added in order to protect small businesses.

&gt; As for the leaked versions by Julia Reda consider the following:
&gt;
&gt; * She is a member of the European pirates - group which seeks out extreme measures to severely break down or even abolish copyright. Hardly an unbiased source when it comes to copyright.

The last interview I heard of her was not arguing against copyright per se, only for the problems caused for small businesses to comply. Her proposal was (iirc, I was driving at the time) to have a percentage of the generated income to use as royalties. 

I do agree that after a history of extension of copyrights it would be good for society to cut back on it substantially. In Germany, copyright started with ""30 years after the death of the author"", 1955 was increased to 50 years, 1993 to 70 years. IMO, 30 years after the death of the author was ample. Personally I'd promote something like 30 years after publication.

&gt; * The majority of MEPs disagree with her that the Parliament's version - which she voted against - would create upload filters. This includes people from both the left and the right.

The division is not as much left and right, more technical competence.

&gt; * Her leaks are incomplete and likely not fully accurate, so judging for ourselves won't work in this case either.

Can you give an example of her leaking inaccurate documents in the past?

&gt; The agreed upon text will likely be somewhere between the Parliament's version that bans filters, and the member states' version that requires them. We can't honestly know what it'll turn out to be though

According to 4c: ""made  best  efforts  to  prevent  their  future  uploads  in 
accordance with paragraph"" I don't see how the future upload could be prevented without a filter. And since ""future upload"" seems to relate to the copyrighted material, not the modified upload itself, a hash of the previous upload would not be sufficient. Some complex filter like image recognition or alike appears to be required.

&gt; relying on a copyright activist's opinion

An alleged copy of the final version. That is not an opinion, it either is or is not a copy.

I take her opinion into account, but it is based on that version and references it, so it's more than just an opinion.

To be fair, EB isn't asking the question, and the YouGov polling is the polling with the highest support for federalism where the question is actually outright being asked.

&gt;That seems like a contradictory opinion to have since if the EU is a good thing, you can logically conclude you'd want the UK to be in it. Having said that though, that's fair enough, I welcome a difference of opinion. 👍

&gt;In a democracy, we need to experience a plurality of voices and, critically, to have the skills, experience and knowledge to gauge the veracity of those voices. While the Internet has brought many freedoms across the world and an unprecedented ability to communicate, it also carries the insidious ability to distort, to mislead and to produce hatred and instability. It functions on a scale and at a speed that is unprecedented in human history.

&gt;You can easily budget for this in the price of meat.

No, farmers don't want their lifestock not to be killed or threatened by wolves. It's a deeply frustrating situation. It is not just about a compensation for a missing sheep. That needs to be found in the first place to get a compensation, good luck with that! They will no longer be able to let the animals roam freely. The sheep sense the danger and are miserable.

I don't see why not.  If people, I dunno, consistently voted each N years to maintain a communist system…

5977,"A mob that 60% of the population agrees with (80% at start).

We don't want the gov to find everyone a job, we know there isn't enough jobs for everyone. The political world has to deal with this somehow instead of blaming individuals (France has 3M unemployed for 100k available jobs).

We want less taxs because middle class has an overall mandatory tax level of 50-60% and rhe feeling that a lot of public money is wasted. There is a lot of injustices in the last reforms too ; less taxes on the wealthy, more on the middle class and poors.

Better public services are required ; as I said we have the feeling that the services we have are not worth what we pay.

About magic rainbow, I can only encourage you to learn the difference about real and speculative economy. The German ordoliberal model EU is built in a way that a lot of savers are speculating and not bringing anything to the real economy. The flows in the world of finance is way higher the the GPD. We want to tax the 0.1% and finance and less middle class.

Also there clearly is a representation problem in our election system, corruption, lack of democracy in the 5th republic.
