You seem to believe that it's about the Dutch paying for the laziness of others. It's not. Like not at all.

Look at Greece which has a highest 10-year sovereign bond's yield (1.556%) than Italy (1.311%) and of course France (-0.063%). Meaning that, if the epidemic turns bad in this country, Greece will face huge difficulties to roll its debt (much more than Italy), because investors will loose the little confidence they have in this State. A bit like in 2010.

But Greece retirement age is 67. Employees in Greece work on average 42 hours a week, and european average is 40.3h ...

France on the other hand has a more robust economy, and it's certainly not for them that coronabonds will be made, if they are.

The main difficulty here is that Italy and Spain are in the Eurozone which has very strict regulations (which follow the Dutch and German economic ideology). Unlike most countries such as the US or the UK, they can't ask their central bank for help in a such crisis, nor can they depreciate their money to attract more investors.",,/r/europe/comments/ftjgl1/a_note_on_the_discussions_taking_place_on_reurope/fm7hdlh/,meet_boll,1585827066

Stop free trade agreements, because the Chinese play unfair and put their companies at an advantage, thus we need to put import duties on chinese product to even the playing field. [This article](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/05/china-has-more-leverage-thank-you-think-trade-war/589726/) is full of examples:

**I. South Korea**
&gt; Lotte, a Korean conglomerate with interests in candy, hotels, retail, and other businesses, [...] committed the crime of providing land for the missile system [the Americans wanted to build in Korea, which China opposed to]. The Chinese government whipped up nationalist ire against the company through the state-controlled media. One op-ed in the Global Times, a newspaper run by the Communist Party, entitled ‚ÄúLotte‚Äôs Development in China Should Come to an End,‚Äù thundered that ‚Äúshowing Lotte the door will be an effective warning to all the other foreign forces that jeopardize China‚Äôs national interests.‚Äù Protests erupted in front of supermarkets owned by the Korean group, while inspectors ordered outlets closed after supposed violations. Sales plummeted, and Lotte eventually exited from the business. That wasn‚Äôt all. Chinese shoppers also shied away from Korean-branded cars and cosmetics. Korean pop stars were denied entry visas; group tours to Seoul for big-spending Chinese travelers were canceled.

**II. Canada**
&gt;Canada is enduring such treatment right now. Angered that Canadian authorities (at the behest of Washington) arrested the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies, Beijing blocked Canada‚Äôs exports of pork and canola, pinching the country‚Äôs agricultural sector. China has taken this step even though it isn‚Äôt in its own economic interest, since its domestic pork industry has been ravaged by swine flu. 

**III. Philippines**
&gt; Similarly, in 2012, Chinese quarantine officers began impounding Philippine bananas amid a flare-up over contested claims in the South China Sea.

**IV. The US**
&gt; Chinese officials can twist laws and regulations to turn up the heat too. For example, they have used anti-monopoly law against foreign companies in ways that inhibited their business. In one famous case in 2013, Mead Johnson, Danone, and other foreign firms were heavily fined for supposed pricing infractions. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the time argued that the anti-monopoly probes ‚Äúoften appear designed to advance industrial policy and boost national champions‚Äù and ‚Äúrely insufficiently on sound economic analysis.‚Äù Chinese regulators have already claimed one victim in the current trade dispute‚Äîthe microchip company Qualcomm, which had to abandon its acquisition of a Dutch firm when Beijing failed to approve the deal.",,/r/europe/comments/ftguv5/europe_must_recognize_china_for_what_it_is_a/fm7aq75/,clodi95,1585819662

Maxime is essentially a male name but in standard french we don't always feminize names with an -a like in Italy, Spain or Portugal. So Maxime is prefered over Maxima, the same way we prefer Isabelle over Isabella, Emmanuelle over Emmanuella etc. And for the record there is a village called Sainte-Maxime in PACA named after Sainte Maxime de Calliante but in occitan the village is called Santa Maxima (like it would have been spelled in other latin countries). 

The surname Maxence comes from ""Maxentius"" and the female form is ""Maxentia"". And -entia always turns in -ence when translated in standard french (like patientia ==&gt; patience, conscientia ==&gt; conscience). So Maxence is both the female and masculine form.

And the second one is also true, and it's a usual criticism I make to global activism. Even if most cultures do have some kind of gendered societies, the export of western terminologies, frames of action and constructs as if they were the only way to understand human behavior is problematic and has traces of neoimperialism. I recently attended a seminar by a Mexican activist who told us how Spanish binary gendered language that was imposed to them was a tool for the progressive disappearing of their indigenous ""gender identities"" since the language failed to capture the different realities of their culture (that and Christian puritanism of course).

&gt;In February 2015,¬†a poll by German polling firm GfK¬†revealed that attitudes have not changed. When asked¬†‚ÄúDo you endorse Russia‚Äôs annexation of Crimea?‚Äù, a total of¬†82% of the respondents answered ‚Äúyes, definitely,‚Äù and another 11%¬†answered¬†‚Äúyes, for the most part.‚Äù¬†Only 2% said they didn‚Äôt know, and another 2% said no. Three percent did not specify their position.

&gt;For their part, Crimeans seem content with their annexation by Russia. Overwhelming majorities say the March 16th referendum was free and fair (91%) and that the government in Kyiv ought to recognize the results of the vote (88%)

The German poll is especially noteworthy because (1) it was financed by an anti-Russia Ukrainian political scientist and (2) the polling firm excluded the most heavily Russian area of Sevastopol and only polled those in small towns. ""The poll results were something of a cold shower to Berezovets.""

So, all the poll results taken before, during, and after the annexation all indicate that Crimeans truly wanted to be part of Russia. Crimea was part of Russia before the USSR, and was transferred to Ukraine in a symbolic move.

294,"repeating my comment from elsewhere:

1. Crimea was part of Russia for hundreds of years. Crimea was transferred to Ukraine in like the 1950s during the Soviet Union as a largely symbolic gesture, transferring land between member states of the USSR.

2. The majority of Crimeans are ethnically Russian. 

3. The referendum had 97% support with 83% turnout. 

4. Every single poll conducted by western media outlets has consistently found that joining Russia was truly the will of the Crimea people - ***overwhelmingly*** so.

304,"&gt;Albanians en masse were also part of the ""Greek"" revolutionaries. The only difference being that they were Christian Albanians. They're called Greek now.

Hahahhaha funny how Albanians were willing to fight for the liberation of Greece but none of them were willing (and did not) fight for the liberation of Albanian . Those who fought for the Greek revolution were self-identifying as Greeks.

&gt;It was a religious matter. 
Nope! it was not! This towns Greek population faced massacres many times in the past. Even a few months earlier:
 
""It was also a potent symbol for revenge, its Greek population having been massacred by the Ottoman forces in the past: the latest of such events, a few months earlier, following the failed rebellion at Moldavia in early 1821; previous massacres of the town's Greeks occurred in 1715 (during the Ottoman reconquest of the Morea) and on Holy Monday, 29 March 1770, after the failed Orlov Revolt.[10][11][12] ""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tripolitsa#Massacre_of_civilians

&gt; There were plenty civillians/women/children killed. ""Collaboration"" is a very loose term. 

It wasn't a relegious matter: 

n the three days following the capture of the city, Muslims (Turks and other Muslims) alongside Jewish **and Christians** supporters of the Ottoman regime, inhabitants of Tripolitsa, were exterminated.

Collaborator is no loose term. Never have been anywhere on the planet.

&gt;The antiquity fetish came later with the European Hellenophiles.

You'd like to think so? You've got to study more history my friend else you're buying all the crap Albanian nationalists serve you.  Philhellenes that brought the antiquity fetish might look a nice  theory to people that had no ethnic - conscience at the time (like Albanians) but it's false.

Read this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemistus_Pletho 

We are talking 1400s. 
"" Reform of the Peloponnese[edit]
Believing that the **Peloponnesians were direct descendants of the ancient Hellenes**, Plethon rejected Justinian's idea of a universal Empire in favour of recreating the Hellenistic civilization, the zenith of Greek influence.[20] In his 1415 and 1418 pamphlets he urged Manuel II and his son Theodore to turn the peninsula into a cultural island with a new constitution of strongly centralised monarchy advised by a small body of middle-class educated men. The army must be composed only of professional **native Greek soldiers** , who would be supported by the taxpayers, or ""Helots"" who would be exempt from military service. Land was to be publicly owned, and a third of all produce given to the state fund; incentives would be given for cultivating virgin land. Trade would be regulated and the use of coinage limited, barter instead being encouraged; locally available products would be supported over imports. Mutilation as a punishment would be abolished, and chain gangs introduced. Homosexuals and sexual deviants would be burnt at the stake. The social and political ideas in these pamphlets were largely derived from Plato's Republic. Plethon touched little on religion, although he expressed disdain for monks, who ""render no service to the common good"". He vaguely prescribed three religious principles: belief in a supreme being; that this being has concern for mankind; and that it is uninfluenced by gifts or flattery. Manuel and Theodore did not act on any of these reforms""",Greece,/r/europe/comments/ft0w7z/april_1822_a_year_after_the_greeks_revolt_against/fm6w7yy/,Frank_cat,1585805065

408,"&gt;Of course it can hurt in the long term. Health care money doesn‚Äôt just rain from the sky.

Putting words into my mouth? Who ever said you should spend more on health care? It could be as simple as banning gatherings of more than five, or ten, instead of fifty people. Setting up online classes for part of the students, on rotation, to reduce volume in schools. Having a schedule for older people to buy groceries. One for medical personnel to shop. Curtailing access to gyms. Any number of measures which would have very little, if any, negative impact. 

&gt;in the end it‚Äôs all just guesswork

Agreed. That's why many people feel it is wise to err slightly on the side of caution health wise rather than money wise. That doesn't mean completely disregarding the economy if you can afford not to

&gt;shutting down countries for half a year probably isn‚Äôt the best course of action

Oversimplifying again? None of the countries currently in lockdown plan to stretch it for longer than a month, a month and a half tops, depending on where they are now. Based on the Asian model. For countries with less of a spread that could have meant even just three weeks.

&gt;meaning countries currently in lockdown will more than likely have to reduce and then reenact such measures periodically.

What makes you think that could never happen with a different approach? Besides, that would only happen if the wrong steps are taken when the country is coming out of the lockdown. And the only way to try and avoid it is to not really go back to normal, but go back to a very controlled version of normal. Not letting the cases rise and go back to *some* of the measures as needed if they do rise. 

&gt;So far, it seems more draconian

I take it that anything more than no gatherings over 50 and table service only is draconian

&gt;as opposed to minimally (and irrelevantly) educated politicians

I don't even know who you're referring to, so that's totally unnecessary

414,"&gt; I have repeatedly covered that. China is running a disinformation campaign and the dems were impeaching him and demonizing him for the proactive steps he did take. And again, Trump is by far the most proactive leader. If you disagree tell me what leader was more proactive than Trump.

Like what proactive steps? And what the Democrats were in cahoots with the Chinese? HAHHAHAHAHHA

&gt; If you disagree tell me what leader was more proactive than Trump.

Tell me one thing that was proactive that he did, that wasn't months late. 

&gt; No a GROUP of doctors. None of them are allowed to openly tell their story if any are still alive. 

Proof that it was multiple doctors.

&gt; Also the researcher at the virus lab in Wuhan that stated bats are ideal to carry the virus. She has been wiped from the sites webpage and the put out a statement that she is alive and well but not available for content. 

She's on Chinese social media, aka Weibo and posting often. Plus it turned out it wasn't bats that were the greatest carriers. 

&gt; lso the original doctor was 34 and healthy and had access to the best treatment availible at his hospital. If you are going to claim that the virus killed him you need a credible source for that.

I don't know, they were swamped with cases and people die. Not gonna get into conspiracy theory realm.

&gt; Why are you happy to hold the US government accountable but defend the CCP in a much worse case?

Because in this case, China handled the situation better and the Western countries bungled their response. You can criticize Western countries and not be pro-CCP, also I have many problems with the chinese government, this one isn't one. 

&gt; what do you think about the CCP ordering the Tiannamen Square massacre?

Random, but they did something bad. But every country has skeletons in their closets. Am I supposed to disappear now since you mentioned Tiannamen Square and I am obviously a Chinese spy? 

&gt; ""Korea and Taiwan "" Both have more experience with China and knew not to believe them and both have suffered greatly.

But Americans and Europeans are too dumb to know, okay lol

You are kind of right, I am only saying **facts** that undermine Russia because I hate such criminal states.

&gt;to anyone who knows Crimea it's undeniable that overwhelming majority of people living there want to be part of Russia.

While this could be true, there is no way to verify this under Russian occupation, nor were their calls of self-determination justifiable under international law. In fact, there were no calls for self-determination - there was only Russian occupation.

&gt;They are Russians after all for fuck sake.

That's what happens, when Russian invades a territory, deports the locals and imports its own people, yeah.

No, we sanction Russia because Russia is a criminal state that invaded a European country.

This is not only cultural imperialism, but it is oppressive on a personal level too. The problem isn't gender per se, but artificial constructions of gender and gender hierarchies. If anything, we should make room in our languages for more nuanced expressions of gender so people who are trans or non-binary can have forms which correctly reflect their gender without judgment.

625,"What?

The party that holds government in Spain is PSOE. Their policies are claimed to be social democratic by Wikipedia, while more left leaning parties like Unidas Podemos are more similar to socialism. It's overly simplistic to simply look at their name, and then conclude ""socialist! "", as the name is rooted in their history, when they were further left.

I can't comment on the personally held politics of the last French president, but his party is social democratic, as seen on Wikipedia, despite their name, which is once again rooted in history. La France insoumise is more akin to a socialist party. Furthemore, the current presidents party, which he formed, is actually a liberal party, meaning centrist.

Are we really talking about the Labour party that is in complete disarray, because they somehow got smashed by Boris Johnson? Do you actually consider Labour socialist? The rose doesn't matter, their policies does.

Are you saying that social democrat and socialist is the same? It might explain why you view these parties the way you do. There are stark differences between the two tho. This is social democracy:

&gt; Social democracy¬†is a¬†political,¬†social¬†and¬†economic philosophy¬†that supports¬†economic and¬†social interventions¬†to promote¬†social justice¬†within the framework of a¬†liberal democratic¬†polity¬†and a¬†capitalist-oriented¬†mixed economy.

It's a stark difference from a socialist. You really need to focus more on actual policies and less on names and symbolism. The fact that social democrat involves the word ""social"" doesn't suddenly make them socialists. It's correct that it is a reference to an increased focus on social policies, but that doesn't instantly make you a socialist, even if you might share some policies. If that were the case we wouldn't have two different terms to define these two different political ideologues.

822,"&gt;Do share if you have examples

Not to be rude but Libyans and Ethopians come to mind. 

 In 1923, Mussolini embarked upon a [campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacification_of_Libya) to consolidate control over the Italian territory of Libya and Italian forces began occupying large areas of Libya to allow for rapid settlement by Italian colonists. They were met with resistance by the [Senussi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senussi) who were led by [Omar Mukhtar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Mukhtar). Civilians suspected of collaboration with the Senussi were executed. Refugees from the fighting were subject to bombing and strafing by Italian aircraft. In 1930, in northern [Cyrenaica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica), 20,000 [Bedouins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouins) were relocated and their land was given to Italian settlers. The Bedouins were forced to march across the desert into [concentration camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_concentration_camps_in_Libya). Starvation and other poor conditions in the camps were rampant and the internees were used for [forced labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labour), ultimately leading to the death of nearly 4,000 internees by the time they were closed in September 1933.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_war_crimes#cite_note-Duggan,_496-497-1) Over 80,000 Cyrenaicans died during the Pacification in all.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_war_crimes#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_war_crimes#cite_note-3) 

 

During the [Second Italo-Ethiopian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War), Italian violations of the [laws of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_War) were reported and documented.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_war_crimes#cite_note-pedaliu-4) These included the use of [chemical weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare) such as [mustard gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_gas), the use of concentration camps in counter-insurgency, and attacks on [Red Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross) facilities.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_war_crimes#cite_note-rain2-5) Italian authorities claimed that these actions were in response to the Ethiopians' use of [Dum-Dum bullets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanding_bullet), which had been banned by declaration IV, 3 of the [Hague Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907), and mutilation of captured soldiers.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_war_crimes#cite_note-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_war_crimes#cite_note-7)

According to the Ethiopian government, 382,800 civilian deaths were directly attributable to the Italian invasion. 17,800 women and children killed by bombing, 30,000 people were killed in the massacre of February 1937, 35,000 people died in concentration camps, and 300,000 people died of privations due to the destruction of their villages and farms. The Ethiopian government also claimed that the Italians destroyed 2,000 churches and 525,000 houses, while confiscating or slaughtering 6 million cattle, 7 million sheep and goats, and 1.7 million horses, mules, and camels, leading to the latter deaths.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_war_crimes#cite_note-8)

During the 1936‚Äì1941 Italian occupation, atrocities also occurred; in the February 1937 [Yekatit 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yekatit_12) massacres as many as 30,000 Ethiopians may have been killed and many more imprisoned as a reprisal for the attempted assassination of Viceroy [Rodolfo Graziani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodolfo_Graziani). A 2017 study estimated that 19,200 were killed - a fifth of the population of Addis Ababa. The [Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church) was especially singled out. Thousands of Ethiopians also died in [concentration camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_concentration_camps) such as [Danane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danane_concentration_camp) and [Nocra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocra_prison_camp).",God Bless the United States,/r/europe/comments/fsbry2/help_us_like_you_were_helped_after_war_italys/fm5bysl/,BewareTheKing,1585770094

I would like to quote a danish doctor to show my perspective:

Dr Peter Goetzsche is Professor of Clinical Research Design and Analysis at the University of Copenhagen and founder of the Cochrane Medical Collaboration. 

What he says:

Our main problem is that no one will ever get in trouble for measures that are too draconian. They will only get in trouble if they do too little. So, our politicians and those working with public health do much more than they should do. No such draconian measures were applied during the 2009 influenza pandemic, and they obviously cannot be applied every winter, which is all year round, as it is always winter somewhere. We cannot close down the whole world permanently. Should it turn out that the epidemic wanes before long, there will be a queue of people wanting to take credit for this. And we can be damned sure draconian measures will be applied again next time.

Successful countries outside of the EU follow the Keynsian school of economic thought, which says that in crises you SPEND. You forced us to SAVE during the crisis, and now we cannot provide for ourselves because our economies contracted. That is not because we made the decision to contract them, it's because you forced us to follow non-standard policies that caused them to contract. 

So, letting your partial responsibility to this disaster aside for a moment. You need to understand that there needs to be inflation to help the economy grow. New money needs to be printed to get the people working and producing. The nominal amount of money does not fucking matter. What matters is the amount of stuff that is produced by the people -this is what the economy is. Dumb fucking shit like memorandums on Italy will cause people to not produce and contract the economy.

This is why we are up in arms. Because we are met with behaviour that seems to be coming from ideological fundamentalists who have been pushing economy destroying bullshit down our throats for years.

1107,"&gt; The coronavirus epidemic is severely testing fundamental principles of European integration, including the notion of solidarity and the free movement of goods within the single market.

&gt; Some European diplomats in Paris are sceptical about French motives. For example, while France portrays its advocacy for so-called coronabonds as moral support for Italy and Spain, the countries hardest hit by the epidemic, France‚Äôs exploding expenditure makes mutalised debt an attractive prospect, one diplomat notes.
Anothor diplomat, from a food-exporting country, found finance minister Bruno Le Maire‚Äôs exhortation to supermarket suppliers to Buy French ‚Äúvery much against the spirit of the EU‚Äù.

&gt; But perhaps no French move has alarmed other Europeans more than Paris‚Äôs ban on the export of surgical masks and other medical supplies to its European partners.

&gt; On March 3rd, President Emmanuel Macron announced that he was requisitioning ‚Äúall stocks and the production of protective masks‚Äù for distribution to medical personnel and French people infected with Covid-19.

&gt; One fifth of all surgical procedures in the EU use personal protective equipment imported from Asia by the Swedish company M√∂lnlycke. The company‚Äôs main distribution warehouse for southern Europe, Belgium and the Netherlands is in Lyon.

&gt; M√∂lnlycke‚Äôs entire stock of an estimated six million masks was seized by the French. All had been contracted for, including a million masks each for France, Italy and Spain. The rest were destined for Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland, which has special trading status with the EU.

&gt; Italy and Spain urgently needed their masks, so M√∂lnlycke tried to cover the loss of the confiscated masks by ordering more from suppliers in far east Asia.

&gt; **Confiscated**

&gt; An unknown number of masks in the subsequent shipment, believed to be in the hundreds of thousands, were also confiscated. M√∂lnlycke refused a request for an interview about the story and would not confirm a colourful version involving a ship‚Äôs captain who allegedly halted unloading in Marseille to reroute for the safety of a Belgian port.

&gt; France eventually allowed two million masks which M√∂lnlycke had contracted to deliver to Italy and Spain to be shipped. French media reported that France donated one million masks to Italy in the spirit of solidarity.

&gt; ‚ÄúPublic health is not an EU competence,‚Äù notes a diplomat from a third EU country in Paris. ‚ÄúThe Treaty on the Functioning of the EU stipulates that in the event of a national public health emergency, you can impose import or export restrictions.‚Äù

&gt; The French were concerned that desperately needed surgical masks not be allowed to leave the EU during the crisis. Sweden reluctantly accepted a ban on exports to countries outside the EU, in the mistaken belief that France, like Germany would lift their ban on internal EU transfers, as recommended by the European Commission.

&gt; A commission spokeswoman on the internal market confirmed that Germany lifted its EU internal export ban, but France ‚Äúclarified that it will not prevent supply to other EU countries once internal vital needs are met.‚Äù

&gt; The EU diplomat who cited the treaty basis for restricting internal trade changed his mind when Paris persisted after the Commission‚Äôs recommendation. ‚ÄúWhen the Commission says, ‚ÄòWe do not think your export ban is justified,‚Äô governments are under obligation to lift those bans. The Germans did so expediently. They French have been very slow‚Äù.

&gt;**‚ÄòAlmost solved‚Äô**

&gt; Stockholm protested at the highest level. Prime minister Stefan L√∂fven raised the subject with the French prime minister and president. For Stockholm, the French confiscation was tantamount to nationalising a private company belonging to a European partner.
‚ÄúThe problem is almost solved and we are working on a complete solution, I hope within a few days,‚Äù said a French official involved in the mask saga.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt is not solved,‚Äù a Swedish source insisted. The French official‚Äôs statement was interpreted to mean that the EU ban on exporting medical equipment outside the Union was a partial solution.

&gt; The spat is not about money, the Swedes insist, since surgical masks have relatively low monetary value. ‚ÄúIn an EU crisis, they confiscated masks that were ordered and designated for other nations ... The French often evoke solidarity within the EU. The really fundamental principle of free movement of goods within the EU is toppled,‚Äù says a Swedish official.

&gt; France announced at the weekend that it is purchasing 600 million masks from China. The contract ‚Äúshows the limitations and contradictions of the export ban,‚Äù says a Swedish source.

&gt; Though Franco-Swedish relations are good overall, the flap risks leaving a negative impression on Swedish and other potential European investors after the crisis. For now, M√∂lnlycke ‚Äúis avoiding France altogether,‚Äù says a Swedish source. ‚ÄúSo that is the consequence. The French market is avoided because it is not seen as reliable.‚Äù",,/r/europe/comments/fsycd0/coronavirus_european_solidarity_sidelined_as/fm466iy/,quixotic_cynic,1585747462

Since the countries as a whole are not a poor it seems like a systemic failure that poverty rates are high. It should and could be solved. It is questionable to use Italian refusal to do so in order to justify demands for eurobonds.

Let's be clear on this, Italy wants Germany to guarantee even more debt it wishes to obtain. It asks the German government and tax payer to accept rising yields on German bonds, ergo Germans are supposed to directly pay many billions of additional interest for the sake of Italy. 

All the while, it makes no concrete and solid proposal on what to use the money for, how that could be controlled, what the cap is and does not agree to oversight or structural reforms.

If we issue CoronaBonds you're in fact paying more for your own debt (in this case getting a less negative interest rate shouldn't be the end of the world).

But again, all the options you said arent a possibility for Italy to ran off their obligations

The bonds being issued by the EU its still on debate (it would be the only way of doing it considering the german restrictions regarding their constitution, at least so far that seems to be whats on the table but most countries, even South ones would prefer to avoid so).

Leaving the Euro doesnt absolve Italy from paying their own debt. In fact they would most likely inflate their currency and pay the debt with less trouble.

Since Italy is a net contributor to the EU I don't think there  is a possibility for Italy to demand for EU to co-pay the debt.  They can contribute less I guess, but doesn't make any kind of sense to contribute to EU and then ask EU to help paying their debt.

1181,"&gt; The European Commission defines a self-employed person as someone: ""pursuing a gainful activity for their own account, under the conditions laid down by national law"". In the exercise of such an activity, the personal element is of special importance and such exercise always involves a large measure of independence in the accomplishment of the professional activities. This definition comes from Directive 2010/41/EU

[This says nothing about not having employees yourself. I have no idea where you got your definition. But the definition is not same all across EU.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-employment#European_Union)

&gt; As indicated by the European Commission in 2010,[17] there are ""different understandings and definitions of the term self-employment across the countries, with a number of different subcategories defined: for instance, according to the legal status of the enterprise, whether the business has employees or not (employers versus own-account workers) and/or the sector in which the business operates. Some countries also make the distinction between self-employed status and the status of 'dependent self-employed' (e.g. Spain, Italy), where the self-employed person works for only one client. Others distinguish self-employment which is carried out in addition to paid employment (e.g. Belgium)""

I checked Finland and there is nothign about employing people yourself.

Even though that entitles them to paid sick days, paid vacation, partial payment of retirement funds and health insurance by the employer, it still doesn't add up to what they used to make when they had to pay for all that by themselves (assuming average sick days).

Since the law is vague and hard to interpret for an individual situation, it can also happen that you think you are a freelancer, and years later some agency finds that you are not, which forces the customer (now ""employer"") to retroactively pay for all those benefits. The freelancer (now ""employee"") also has to pay things like retirement funds, but at least gets some entitlements from that. Especially for the customer, that is a high risk that most won't take anymore. The hourly rates are so high that they already take into consideration that the freelancer has more expenses than an employee.

The original excuse was to help low paid ""fake"" freelancers like taxi drivers or delivery men, who effectively made less than minimum wage and would be better off with employment at minimum wage.

1240,"Yes, it's the same thing. It's also illegal here and there are many laws like the ones you have described, but the issue is that the law is hard to enforce. Consider that 92% of companies in Italy are small sized, they are called ""PMI"" that stands for ""Piccole Medie Imprese"" or ""Small and Medium sized enterprises"". The companies in this category officially have no more than 250 employees, but the most common ones have from 2 to 50 employees, more or less. The founder/owner is also in charge of pretty much everything almost all the times. Surely, you *could* sue him and he might be forced to hire you, but then your life at that job would probably become miserable given that you will have to sit in the same room and work with him daily. Sure you *could* then sue him again for mobbing, but at that point I don't think anyone would keep that work relation going on. Add to this that finding a new job might be hard and take a long time: imagine that all companies around you need to employ just a bunch of people and they already have them. Not many people are going to sue their boss, especially if they have children and mortgages.

 

These policies are actively employed only on big or multinational companies and do not really protect many people employed by PMI.

Yes, precisely. If Hungarians vote for a wannabe dictator (well, not so wannabe anymore)  then cutting off EU funds to show that the EU will categorically not support such a regime, that's completely fair game. If the Hungarian people find out that they are being hurt by this change, they can vote for a more pro-democratic leader. Wellbeing of the Hungarian people is in the hands of the Hungarian people in this sense and if it isn't, then such a country has no place in the EU and the EU should not be spraying it with money.

That is not what edgy teenager does. So the metaphor is misplaced. On the other hand, edgy teenagers says stupid shit out of ignorance while believing to be smart. Also edgy teenagers tend to miss the difference between being honest and assholes.

I can't speak for Spain or Portugal because I don't know enough their scenario. Let me try to relieve a small bit your immense ignorance on the topic so next time you talk you have a sort of idea of what you are saying.

[Here you can find a table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_debt_crisis#EU_emergency_measures) summarizing which countries got help in the 2008 financial crisis. Italy, being a net contributor to EU, contributed to the rescue of Greece, Ireland etc.

Also, thinking the issues are originating from 2008 crisis is extremely naive. [Italian public debt](https://i2.res.24o.it/images2010/Editrice/ILSOLE24ORE/ILSOLE24ORE/Online/Immagini/_Oggetti_Embedded/Grafici/2018/10/19/GRAFICO_01-01.png) exploded in the late 70s and 80s. It was slowly but constantly decreasing before the global crisis of last decade, from which Italy never really recovered. It should be simple to unerstand that is just extremely hard to decrease such an enormous public debt without killing the economy. The only solution would be to seize the private wealth of citizens but that would mean a political suicide and the end of Italy in EU, which would probably end the EU itself.

In Croatia we have the same thing, your ""gross"" wage, which is in your contract, is for example 8500 HRK (about average). You get \~6000 net. But your real gross wage (which is called ""gross 2"" here and most people don't even know it) is actually \~10000. Then you pay 25% VAT on purchases, which is probably around 1000 per month. This means the government takes \~5000/10000 - 50% of what you make - as opposed to taking only 2500/8500 (30%). 

In reality the 8500 ""gross"" is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is how much you cost your employer (what the employer cares about) and how much money you actually get (what you care about).

That statement isn't even necessary, it's superfluous considering sanctions overwhelmingly cover *exports* from a target nation rather than imports to it.

Generally speaking when it comes to physical goods sanctions aren't directed at imports to a target nation at all unless they fall into some highly specific category like weapons or components that might be used in a weapon system like aircraft parts or certain advanced electronics, and anything that's a vital part of the nuclear industry in Iran's case obviously.

Comparing criticism of Orban, and discussion of ways to stop him, to the USSR's murder and repression of the opposition is ludicrous and hyperbolic. It's also deeply ironic, since Orban is aping their methods increasingly as means to strengthen his power and control and restrict the opposition.

1671,"A couple of questions for you:

1. How much of Spain's trade is with EU countries, as a percentage?
2. How much is that worth as a share of GDP?

You'll find that Spain profits immensely from the EU, and that the economic benefits it gets from being in the EU, with access to the single market, far outweight the cost of its financial contributions to the EU.

If Spain weren't in the EU, yes, you wouldn't have to pay the contributions, but Spain also wouldn't get the EU funds which you admit are greater than that figure, and Spain's income from trade with EU nations would be much lower. The end result is that Spain would be far, far poorer if it weren't in the EU.

Incidentally, if you bother to check, you'll probably find that your small town has benefitted a great deal from EU development funds, since they explicitly help economically deprived places.

How long that went on for with the eu undermining it every step of the way with the help of pro eu parliament in the uk. The eu has already threatened Hungary and poland with economic sanctions if they tried to leave. Just because somebody uses power to stop elections in a crisis doest make them a dictator! 

US president roosevelt halted elections due to ww2 orban has done this during a crisis that has been speculated to cause an economic crash never seen since the great depression, the instability caused by elections and a change of government and shuffling if cabinet seats and priorities in government is never good. He had an excuse. 

Erdogan however, does not have am excuse, he did so because he felt like it, because he wanted more power, turkey wasn't in any sort of crisis that europe wasn't in already (migration crisis) in fact he sited a failed coup against him from long ago. Erdogan motives are due to his closeted islamic theologist  tendencies, he is actively taking turkey from a secular democratic state to an Islamist authoritarian regime similar to persia because he wants to! And his power grab in northern syria. You have no argument against this. Down vote me because you don't like what I'm saying. But you know i am right.

And why would nationalists want to leave the borders open...... key word nationalists, you know the guys in power because of the migrant crisis, elected because they said theyd tighten the borders. Gobshite. Dont know where your sources are for that.

Look i think you what i want too, a successful europe. I love europe and i want to see it prosper. But the eu in its current form isnt the answer. The EU is trying to build an army, its trying to centralize and increase its powers in brussels, its doing so by censorship, slander, extortion, mass migration and other means. The eu was never meant to be an organisation to help europe. Its trying to style itself like the USA. It wants to become a federal empire, with 700 million people in it with the combined GDP of dousins of countries at its disposal. Now the thought process is right. If europe is to survive the coming century it must do so united, but that shouldnt mean encroaching on memeber states sovereignty, because unlike the USA, europe is extremely diverse, in fact its the most diverse continent on the planet hosting the largest concentration if nationalities and languages than any continent. Trying to shoehorn everyone into this project is not the way to go. There has to be compromise and respect and no political intrigue or sabotaging. And certainly no economic sanctions solely on the basis of not taking in islamic refugees. Let me state. The visigrad group has seen almost no terrorist incidents the last decade. Compare that to the rest of europe. Amd other countries like slovenia, a population of a million, have had over 2 million (which is more than the native population of slovenia) refugees from the middle east pass through its borders, that's potentially nation destroying. And the eu tried to bully them for closing their borders.

I would gladly support the eu if:

It was democratic (its not)
If we had a say who runs it (we dont)
If the people who run it were accountable to us( they arent)
If they respected member states authority and sovereignty (they dont) 
If they didn't force immigration down our throats without a reason better than ""diversity is good"" (it clearly isn't, seeing as its the main reason the eu is having so much trouble right now, so many different nationalities with their own interests to control) 

Sure europes population is declining and the birth rates are below replacement rates, but the rest of the world is heading their too, we cant rely on immigration. We must do as hungary has done and provide incentives to parenthood such as removing taxes for women with more than 4 children such as hungary has etc. East germanys population skyrocketed after the war and during the cold war and they had no immigration.

Italians also perpetrated a 'Stab in the Back' myth against the Treaty of London, having themselves betrayed the Triple Alliance.

However, the Entente did not betray the Italians, it was their greed that undid them - they got the S√ºd-Tirol/Trentino-Alto Adig√´ and Istria, but they were denied Dalmatia and Albania, territories with a minority Italian populace and areas which were not orginally stipulated in the Treaty.

They spent 20 years demanding their return and from 1938-1940 they occupied Albania and declared war on Yugoslavia and Greece. For example they deported 25,000 Slovenian's from Ljubijana to Italian concentration camps in Gradisca and Istria.

1726,"Worrying? Yes. Out of the ordinary? No.

Consider the following:

1. Bulgaria's PM is a gangster.
2. Croatia's President openly defended convicted war criminal Slobodan Praljak
3. Spain sends in the police to beat up people in Catalan voting stations, then continues to occupy Catalonia, and politically imprison elected Catalan officials.
4. Hungary harbors Nikola Gruevski, convicted Macedonian ex-PM refugee.
5. Greece has single handedly caused the Eurozone crisis, and did so by intentionally lying about its finances. Then, after being saved by the overly generous Germans, starts a public hate campaign against said Germans. As of 2020, Greeks are still actively spreading hate against Germany.

3) Was a minor news item that lasted about as long as the focus on Venezuela.

2) Was largely ignored by all mainstream media.

1) EU leaders seem completely fine with this. This mafioso Borisov can even host EU enlargement summits, and be the president of the EU council for 6 months, no problem!

4) I bet less than 1% of the EU's population even knows this.

5) I don't see anybody giving a shit?

These are just some examples of unacceptable behaviour by member states that I could think of, off the top of my head. So, in all honesty, let's face the facts. EU leadership, media, and large portions of the general public are as hypocritic and complacent as it gets. Macron openly admires military dictator and mass murderer Napoleon? No problem! German fringe party perhaps admires Hitler? SHAME! BAN THEM!!! Spain cracks down on people voting on their own self-determination? NO COMMENT! We can't interfere with member states internal issues! Orban cracks down on journalists and the opposition? Booooo! Bad Viktor!
It's all one giant mess. Hypocrisy, self-serving opportunism, egocentrism, you name it.

Going forward, I honestly can see only two paths ahead:
1) The EU, combined with Merkel's ""two speed"" solution, becomes a United States of Europe. The Great Magyar Empire under Augustus Orban I can remain in the EU but outside the Federation. Strict rules will be enforced in the Federation. You transgress = you get kicked out by simple majority vote. Or make it easy(?) and evoke article 50. The EU army becomes a force equal to the US army, and gives NATO the fist it needs to stop the combined might of Chinese and Russian imperialist aspirations.

2) The EU dissolves and Europe reverts to the times of the early middle ages. Tribal fiefdoms galore, everybody enjoying the blissful ignorance of splendid isolation. England keeps on thinking that it's 1850, and assumes that playing cricket with India means the Empire still exists. Meanwhile China slowly but surely imposes its will on the world, and, together with Russia turns Eastern Europe into a vassal state. Trump will squeeze all seperate European statelets, England included, with opressive trade deals. Putin will squeeze whatever country relies on Russian gas. And the list goes on and on and on.

And herein lies the epicly absurd notion that people like Orban and Le Pen are nationalists. They are not. They are egocentric and opportunistic collaborators. Nationalists think their country is the best and work in the interest of their country. Without exception, ALL these ""nationalists"" are Putin asskissers. Kissing the ass of Europe's greatest short term enemy, an enemy which openly tries to weaken and vassalize all European nations, is what I would resoundly call TREASON. What makes the deceit of traitors like Orban even more evident, is that they simultaneously kiss Putin's ass, and claim to be bulwarks against Islamisation. And who is Iran's biggest friend? Right...Putin. Make no mistake: if this were 1940, it's exactly the Orbans, Wilders, Le Pens, Salvinis, who'd be first in line to offer their services to the Nazi occupiers. Orban &amp; co. are traitorous collaborators, nothing more and nothing less.

And this while the Arabs didn't even have nukes of their own. Pakistan and India have been at perpetual war with eachother forever, and both are nuclear powers. Whenever their soldiers kill eachother in Kashmir, it doesn't even make the news. Nuclear weapons only get used when the other side hypothetically uses them first. This by definition means they can't be used. The only alternative is the ""Samson option"". Once your civilisation is about to be destroyed, you use them to destroy everyone, as a last resort giant middle finger. Neither of these scenarios are possible. Already in 1953 Truman not only dismissed McArthur's idea of nuking China, but he relieved McArthur of his duties for even suggesting it. And this was only 8 years after the USA used nuclear weapons against Japan. NATO and Russia could go to war perfectly fine. The Russians will probably just flee without a shot being fired, knowing how pathetic and laughable their army is, so they can try and spin the story favourably for their home audience. But in no imaginable scenario would there be any nuclear war. That's just science fiction. The only way a nuclear weapon could be used is by a terrorist organisation.

1825,"The reason for the question that is pretty much the premise of the article, is answered directly in the website that is the source of this data. ( [https://www.euromomo.eu/](https://www.euromomo.eu/) )

&amp;#x200B;

I quote: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Over the past few days, the EuroMOMO hub has received many questions about the weekly all-cause mortality data and the possible contribution of any COVID-19 related mortality. Some wonder why no increased mortality is observed in the reported mortality figures for the COVID-19 affected countries.   
&gt;  
&gt;The answer is that increased mortality that may occur primarily at subnational level or within smaller focal areas, and/or concentrated within smaller age groups, may not be detectable at the national level, even more so not in the pooled analysis at European level, given the large total population denominator. Furthermore, there is always a few weeks of delay in death registration and reporting. Hence, the EuroMOMO mortality figures for the most recent weeks must be interpreted with some caution.  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore, although increased mortality may not be immediately observable in the EuroMOMO figures, this does not mean that increased mortality does not occur in some areas or in some age groups, including mortality related to COVID-19.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/fsnqcv/covid19_yet_to_impact_europes_overall_mortality/fm2h2xo/,TheItalianDonkey,1585697340

1900,"You have to understand that ""the stiff upper lip"" is an alien concept to us. Sadly, most of us are either in the ""*I'm the king of the world, nothing can touch me*"" or the ""*Doomsday is upon us*"" mode, with not much else in-between. Right now it seems everyone has cascaded into the latter (some health professionals by resigining en-masse and a part of the public by directing their frustration at all of them).

At the moment I suspect they are not only lacking PPE but also leadership and knowledge. My guess is that a lot of the medical personnel is not up-to-date on what they are supposed to do and probably get most of their information on the virus from the media so probably the prevailing sentiment is that infection equals an automatic death sentence, which is not true, though the risks are high. They should focus on learning from others and finding solutions, flawed as they may be, instead of giving in to panic. Once they get over the initial shock the public will again shift to a more favourable view of them.

For what it's worth, prison sentences are unlikely, especially for doctors. For example the 2nd link you posted states the prosecuters will investigate the managers that called all personnel (confirmend and not confirmed) in a single meeting room.",,/r/europe/comments/fsiu8l/doctors_suffering_in_romania_during_coronavirus/fm23a5t/,MonitorMendicant,1585689829

If we would federalize, that would change, because it would not be done on the head of state level, but within the parliament, causing ruptures all over the place, making the parliament itself barely, if at all workable.

We have alot of stuff to do as a union, the european identity has to rise, and the nations have to sort out the differences out first. But that takes time, decades rather than years.

I'm all in for more EU (taking the next step and go for a fiscal union for example).

I'm not ok with any country deciding what the fiscal policy of another country should be. Or we all share the same strict rules or we don't share at all.

I'm from Portugal and I gave my personal example. Somebody with my job in the Netherlands can afford a Tesla Model S, I can afford a Mercedes c220 of 2002 with 400k km on it. This is fucking ridiculous. There's no way I would accept more austerity.

What I've realised lately on Reddit and seems that even politicians suffer of the same problem is that in the South of Europe the last decade wasnt one of economic grown. It was a time of huge austerity and of stabilization of the economy. Every country in the South of Europe had huge budget surplus if we didnt take in account the interest of their debt.

I know it seems (and it is) really pitty to say ""well if I'm going down you're going down with me"" but I don't see any other way of getting out of this mess.

&gt; In public policy, a sunset provision or clause is a measure within a statute, regulation or other law that provides that the law shall cease to have effect after a specific date, unless further legislative action is taken to extend the law. Most laws do not have sunset clauses and therefore remain in force indefinitely, except under systems in which desuetude applies. 

-

&gt; The roots of sunset provisions are laid in Roman law of the mandate but the first philosophical reference is traced in the laws of Plato.[3] At the time of the Roman Republic, the empowerment of the Roman Senate to collect special taxes and to activate troops was limited in time and extent. Those empowerments ended before the expiration of an electoral office, such as the Proconsul. The rule *Ad tempus concessa post tempus censetur denegata* is translated as ""what is admitted for a period will be refused after the period"". The same rules were applied in the Roman emergency legislation. The fundamental principle appeared in several areas of legislation and later codified in the *Codex Iustinianus* (10, 61, 1). The principle was broken when Julius Caesar became dictator for life.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/fsea05/von_der_leyen_concerned_as_orban_to_rule_by_decree/fm1c2zs/,duisThias,1585675721

That letter is politics, the purest form of politics. Ironically, in Europe there are majors and Presidents of the Province a lot more powerfull, in theory, than ours but with a lot less political access than the major of Milan or Naples. This is case of nordics states for example. Look at our medias, there is plenty of majors and few MP, the most important political persons nowadays in Italy emerge from municipalities and not through parties...every country has its political unwritten rules. 

In a situation like these this letter could be less important than other times on our domestic politics - and I think it is nothing very important to be honest, because there aren't Zaia and Fontana there and Bonaccini has a different style in these days, he is less visible on medias than them - and the very problem is Calenda, who is nobody outside Twitter.

In this emergency the importance of intergovernmental relationships is clear, we saw Presidents of Region who opposed the Government few times, Presidents who wanted more, Presidents who did more...if everyone went on the line of the government it's because everything escalated quickly and there was not much more to do, but there were a lot of negotiation for everything even at the beginning of this emergency and someone did what he want.

2143,"&gt;It does make sense if you try to place this with the context of agreements made within the EU concerning the debt vs. GDP ratio, which itself stems from the belief that one can not keep Borrowing at the same rate forever, let alone at the same interest.

Except that's *exactly* what investment banks do. The belief this agreement stems from seems to be entirely misguided. In fact, several countries outside the EU substantially violate that ratio limit and are doing fine economically.

Maybe it's about time we amend this agreement accordingly?

&gt;This money will not go to ‚Äúregular‚Äù welfare measures you seem to describe, but emergency measures aimed at keeping as many businesses and individuals afloat

Right, so the idea is to keep austerity going on *indefinitely*, weakening social nets, exposing the economy in the process:

* Gutting essential public services - like healthcare - can easily end up biting you in the ass later on - like during a pandemic your anemic services are unprepared to deal with - further increasing the economic impact of such crises.
* Less social and job security during a crisis =&gt; workers lose purchasing power more drastically, save up for security funds instead of spending it on consumer goods =&gt; less consumer spending =&gt; companies go bankrup =&gt; workers are laid off =&gt; less consumer spending, and so on...

Simply for the sake of building up an emergency fund that may very well not be nearly enough to cover for the crises that will be more likely to happen as a result? For reference, the current crisis is already worse than the 2008 one, and we're not nearly out of it right now, no EU country has passed the peak yet.

Even without considering the humanitarian impact of this thought process - which is also pretty bad - that just seems as irresponsible in terms of economics as the Italian approach.",,/r/europe/comments/fs0cew/cartoon_in_one_of_the_bigger_dutch_newspapers/fm1c5jt/,Perett2822120,1585675756

2179,"**The Coronavirus Disinformation Campaign Against Poland**

Russia uses fake news to divide Europe.

By Stanislaw Zaryn March 29, 2020 3:22 pm ET

**Warsaw**

Russia is exploiting the coronavirus crisis to wage information warfare. Poland, a longtime target of Russia‚Äôs propaganda machine, has in recent days been hit with two pandemic-related disinformation campaigns. The goal is to smear Poland and pit it against the rest of Europe.

Alessio D‚ÄôAmato, the top health official in Italy‚Äôs Lazio region, was quoted on March 22 as saying that Poland had seized protective equipment destined for his coronavirus-stricken region. More specifically, he said the cargo‚Äîmore than 23,000 protective masks‚Äîwas taken by Polish customs officials. Mr. D‚ÄôAmato‚Äôs accusations were immediately picked up by some of the biggest media outlets in Italy.

The story went viral. Internet users in Italy accused Poland of lacking empathy and breaking European solidarity. Social and traditional media blamed the scandal on the Polish government, which was condemned for dividing Europe and stealing from Italians in their hour of need.

But Poland‚Äôs Foreign Ministry firmly denies the accusations. The seizure of masks never took place. It‚Äôs hard to say why Mr. D‚ÄôAmato came to believe that it did. There was no blocked transport of protective masks from Poland to Italy‚Äîthat was fake news. In response, the Italian Embassy in Warsaw has since confirmed that ‚Äúthe delivery of the masks to Italy will soon carry on without major problems,‚Äù but hasn‚Äôt said whether the initial stories were true or false.

Around the same time, on March 23, Polish-Italian relations were targeted by another disinformation operation. Alexei Pushkov, a Russian senator and former chairman of the Duma‚Äôs committee on international affairs, tweeted that Poland had closed its airspace to a Russian aircraft delivering aid to Italy. He claimed Poland‚Äôs decision forced the plane to take a detour, delaying delivery of medical equipment. This he called ‚Äúmeanness on the level of public policy.‚Äù

Mr. Pushkov‚Äôs allegations against Poland were picked up by journalists and ordinary internet users not only in Russia, but also in European Union countries like Italy and Ireland. A few politicians from EU member states also endorsed the narrative that Polish authorities were so blinded by anti-Russian sentiment that they hurt Italy during its crisis simply to slight Russia.

Fake news‚Äîagain. Poland‚Äôs Foreign Ministry denied the claims immediately and made clear that Polish airspace remained open. Polish authorities also disclosed that the Russian military aircraft had never planned to pass through Polish airspace; no request for access had been made. Then Russia‚Äôs ambassador was summoned to the Polish Foreign Ministry. By the next day, March 24, Mr. Pushkov had deleted his tweet alleging Polish wrongdoing.

These examples show that there has been an attempt to use false information about the coronavirus crisis to denigrate Poland. It fits the pattern of Russian propaganda campaigns accusing Poland of destabilizing Europe, provoking diplomatic disputes, and generally acting selfishly.

Exploiting Covid-19 serves the Kremlin‚Äôs longstanding goal of weakening the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But one element is new: Russia is using the coronavirus crisis to portray itself as a capable international leader, able to deal with the disease effectively and help others. This is supposed to help pull the Kremlin out of its international isolation, thawing relations with European countries that suffered after Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

Moscow is after sanctions relief. It claims it would like to do even more to help Europe respond to the coronavirus, but sanctions‚Äîimposed after the Russian annexation of Crimea‚Äîhold it back. Undermining Poland, a country whose stance on Russia sanctions is one of the firmest in Europe, is part of that strategy. The coronavirus disinformation campaign shows that the Kremlin is determined to seize every opportunity, including great tragedies, to push its agenda.

Because you believe that Ireland isn't benefiting from both?

Frankly let's be honest, if Ireland weren't part of the EU it would be treated as one of the worst tax heaven, and rightly so.

2239,"&gt; I am 150% behind paying out money to the rest of the EU. I would even be for an equalisation program, where we send constant direct transfers of cash from the rich countries to build up the poorer countries.

Just as an addition: this is, by the way, something that is already done in many countries (in Germany it is called ""[L√§nderfinanzausgleich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization_Payments_in_Germany)"") and [the EU does it too already](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_Funds_and_Cohesion_Fund). But neither of these systems have achieved equality yet. Which is a very difficult thing to reach in the best of circumstances. If national/local posturing come into the mix or somebody corrupt is siphoning off funds, then it becomes close to impossible.

2299,"&gt; The amount of tax the Dutch citizens pay has to do with the financial stability of the Netherlands as a country. If the government receives more income they can spend more money without running a deficit.

Ok, there is a misunderstaning here. That has little to do with having a very high tax rate (people being taxed heavily in the Netherlands). That is also the case in Italy. Italian instability is not because we have low tax rate, but because of tax evasion and the huge debt. The latter, again, is inherithed from the 80s. [Have a look at this picture](https://i2.res.24o.it/images2010/Editrice/ILSOLE24ORE/ILSOLE24ORE/Online/Immagini/_Oggetti_Embedded/Grafici/2018/10/19/GRAFICO_01-01.png). The Dutch in this thread seem convinced that Italy is spending too much while it is clearly not the case. As you can see, the debt started to decrease in the 90s til the 2008 financial crisis from which we never really recovered.

&gt; I get that you (or other people abroad) don't care about the amount of tax we pay.

Because it has no effects on other EU countries. Contrary to what you said, Netherlands would be financially stable even with lower income taxes. It would just mean a less strong welfare state etc. I mean, it is good that you have that in my opinion, but lowering tax rates and reducing social expences wouldn't affect the other countries, just people living in the Netherlands.

&gt;  we don't care that Fiat is stationed in Amsterdam.

On the other hand, Dutch legislation facilitates the avoidance of tax is affecting other EU countries and shouldn't be allowed in the EU, in my opinion.

&gt;  However, The Netherlands is not responsible for Fiat's (and other companies) strategy. They voluntarily choose to station themselves in The Netherlands as to be able to avoid tax.

Of course it is not responsible, but we shouldn't expect the corporations to behave in the interest of the public.

&gt; If the Dutch were to close this loophole, Fiat's headquarters may move to another country which enables them to pay the least amount of tax possible. It is true that the Dutch legislation facilitates the avoidance of tax, but it are still the companies that choose to do so. The majority of the corporations will always have the tendency to avoid tax, changing Dutch tax laws won't change that.

Sure, but if that place is outside the EU, european corporations might have less incentives to do that.",,/r/europe/comments/fs9o36/appeal_of_italian_politician_to_drop_eurobonds/fm0yx9x/,stealthisnick,1585668879

2308,"&gt;After extensive pressure from the EU yes.

Even ZP in 2009 was already taking measures to balance the budget in a crashing economy. The pressure from the EU (that at that point was closer to extortion with Greece) was not about balancing the budget, it was about austerity as the way to exit the crisis vs. expansive measures. The biggest intervention by the EU was the FROB to save the banking system (which had an important presence of European banks like Deutsche and ING, that were heavily exposed to defaults).

&gt;This was set into movement before the crisis of 2008 when southern states suddenly could get cheap loans from which they build up their social securities. They have been spending money they didnt have for decades and changed nothing in their countries that would make sure they could pay the loans back eventually.

But this is only partially true. As the data shows, the Spanish Government was borrowing money in a scale very much proportional to its GDP growth. The issue was that the underlying economic development in Spain did not have strong foundations (and of course there are many reasons: excessive reliance on construction, leading to a kind of subprime crisis, and tourism or loss of industrial areas, chronic unemployment, a banking system too eager to expand without enough insurance), and it all came down in 2008. So you can definitely criticize that, go on, and I'll agree with you that the economic choices in the Spanish economy of the late 90s fucked us for decades, but again: don't explain it away as ""Southerners borrowing money for easy paychecks"".

&gt;Efficiency that has yet to be seen across most if not all sectors in  Italy and Spain for example. I worked with loads of people from those  countries and they are all very nice but work ethic was hardly seen..

Once 2014. Once in 2018. Did we get more aircraft to douse fires during these 4 years? Nah. Let's just not spend money on this and hope it doesn't happen again (despite climate change)... or just borrow some more aircrafts from our neighbors when needed. The same goes for the army and budget cuts for many years (it seems that it has increased a bit in the last few years... I would assume due to Russia being a rather aggressive neighbor).,,/r/europe/comments/fr1m69/lockdown_what_lockdown_swedens_unusual_response/fm0m7so/,Jotun35,1585661387
2374,"It's politically unsustainable to go on like this, because the other countries have domestic restrictions just like you, if you try to treat them like you treated Greece the last time, what you had in Greece, i.e. anti-EU government + population losing faith in the EU will happen in Italy and Spain, possibly both at the same time. And France is there among the countries where a massive political crisis may happen, they already had large scale strikes, disruptions, violent demonstrations and this was all in times of economic growth. Even if it was just Spain and Italy, it would be hugely problematic, if it is France as well, we are all fucked.

You guys and the Germans are the winners of the economic integration, you both are hugely pro-export oriented, you have the most advanced economies in the single market and so you are drawing the talent and high-tech industries to yourself and at the same time, you have an access with no obstacles to the less developed economies in the single market.

I was trying not to be too much of a dick but ok, let me openly shit on your massive ignorance then.

&gt; I mentioned southern countries

Eurobonds are supported by several countries considerably to the north of the netherlands, as well as by your neighbors the Belgians. Look up a map, they're free.

&gt; We would be a lot poorer since the money we spend now to satisfy the south wil be gone.

You don't actually have to spend any money upfront in a eurobonds program. Zero, zilch, nada. You're not forced to issue Dutch eurobonds, you're not forced to buy them, you don't have to pay into a fund or anything. You simply do not know how the program you think you're opposing works.

&gt; Northern voters will be so angry at their politicians to be so stupid to trust the Southern countries again with their taxmoney

If you don't understand how eurobonds work I have no hope you could understand this, but no Northern country lost money on the bailouts, which additionally did not just to Southern countries, and to which additionally Southern countries also participated. All bailouts were repaid in full, the last tranche in 2018.

i agree. which is why its ending in 2021. January 1st.

&gt; Your tax loophole scheme is preventing big countries in getting the appropriate amount of taxes, you do realize that?

again, you overestimate the value of the money being brought in. its barely 3 billion.
we had a surplus of 14 billion, and we cut our national debt by the tens of billions. over 17% in 5 years time. 

we didnt achieve that because of our tax schemes, we did that because we are a notoriously frugal and calvinistic society that recognizes the value of money, and is wise with finances.

and Italy also did not garner a 132% debt to GDP ratio becauses of our tax schemes, but because they fucked up.

&gt; Actually in the year 2008 we had the biggest rank in the gdp per capita but after that the crisis came. 

True that but things were much better with dracmae.

&gt; And that's not the first time we got into a crisis, we had bankrupted many times during the past. 

Also true but not after our militaristic dictatorship. The only good thing they did was that by the time we overthrown them we had 0 national debt.

&gt; It would be more expensive because they would need visa and passport. 

No they wouldn't. We're in Schengen which already has countries that are not in the EU, like Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.

&gt; That's not true , there are specific laws and regulations. . Eurogroup is an informal body between finance ministers of EU and they have to compromise and agree.

There was a overwhelming support from countries for the funds and Germany blocked them

&gt; Btw I think that Germany said no because they would have to give the more money ( to pay the bonds) but the would win the less because the money would go to weak economies, so they would lose money out of this. 

Don't worry, they will pay far more when Corona ends and  European economies start to fall like a house of cards. If France gets hit as had as Spain and Italy the euro is over and we will have just a couple of months to jump out before the ship completely sinks.

&gt; I just answered your question . But all parties fucked economy, for example the debt during 2007-2009 (ND) was increased by billions of euros. 

But then the American recession happened so we can't blame them (every time daddy America fucks up their economy, Europe turns into a shit show) like how we can't blame them for the crisis after Corona. We can surely blame Pasok for the spending and the corruption that was created during the Papandreou era.

&gt; Are you referring to a specific event during 2015?

[read the ""2015"" and the ""2016"" part.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis)

&gt; Also ND said that will let businesses that affected by coronavirus, to pay their employees half their salary and making them work half the time they used to work. 

They say that just so we won't have riots and protests now as we need to stay home. Paying someone half their salary for half the work is basically the same thing and not a single shop is going to open for just for 4 hours a day. They beg for businesses not to completely close down and fire people which has a little effect. I'm afraid that this crisis will be one of the worst ones we've had until now and it will kill far more people than corona.

2596,"I see you refuse to understand my meaning with the motivation: Condoms have a longer-term statistical impact, whereas covid-19 is acute with death as one of the direct side affects, and not an indirect side affect like ""get STI, become infertile, treat infertility, get pregnant, die giving birth"". This is no difference for you? If you refuse to see the (quite coarse) nuance differences between condoms and covid-19 I don't see the point of discussing it any further. 

Hmm, what exactly do you imagine would happen to families if a total lockdown would happen? The kids would magically disappear? Because they can't stay in daycare/school, so they have to be with their caretaker. And the caretaker has to go shopping, and I wouldn't leave a young child alone in my apartment. 
Your issue with kids would just become a larger issue given a lockdown. 

Right, so your friends are following the recommendations, non-essential meetings are still allowed, but practice social distance and don't hug when you meet, chew with your mouth closed and wash your hands. Staying safe doesn't have to be painfully isolated. If you wanna use the condom analogy, total lockdown is practicing abstinence instead of taking protective measurements. 

I also note your quite elitist view that only educated people adjust their commute. Why did you feel the need to mention the education of your friends? Perhaps you should widen your circle of friends. 

For what reason are you sceptical? The only reason people are practicing full lockdowns is because China started doing it a couple of months ago, up until that point in time, there were no belief what so ever that a european country could lock down completly. It is an emotional, spontaneous reaction from politicians who feel like they are loosing control (Covid-19 demonstrations in China for example would be chatastrophical for the chinese regime), and have to do *something*. Sweden on the other hand, is practicing evidence-based actions, based on common plans among stakeholders developed for societal  crises. Our largest issue right now is the fact that crisis-critical material and resources has been privatized and discontinued for the past decade, which affects the treatment, but is unrelated to our treatment of the societal aspects, like spread in public and such.

* then you have you get an appointment at your pr√©fecture ( the administrative building of the department you live in), which can be very difficult, depending on where you live - mine took ~2 months to book and it was for a month afterwards, just to give all the paperwork ( note: some prefectures allow sending it all via mail)

* then you get to book an interview, for 2-3 months later, where they ask you all sorts of questions about you, why do you want the citizenship, what will you bring, and a lot of questions about France, it's organisation, values, history ,etc. to see if you are a real part of society or just want the benefits of the passport

* if all this is successful, you then have to wait 12-16 months for your dossier to be approved by various agencies and the Ministry of Interior, who might physically verify you ( like ask your neighbors, colleagues what you're like) and do some background checks.

2677,"&gt; And if you know economics you would know that the easy way for Greece to fix their problems would have been to exit the Eurozone and devalue their currency. IF the plan worked the Greek economy would have recovered if not improved by now.

That's why I support Greece leaving EU willingly with her own terms like UK did. If we don't do it willingly and they just kick us out we will destabilize Euro and possibly countries like Italy and Spain will suffer and we don't want that. Planning behind our backs to kick us out without including us in the talks is just a dick move (especially since we want the same thing).

&gt; This is spending more then you have and then wondering why you come up short on cash all the time.

A monthly lease for a relative small apartment (50 square meters) in Greece costs about 300-400‚Ç¨ (I pay 350‚Ç¨ for myself)

Personally I see it as an investment as I will pay in loans the same amount of money (currently my monthly payments are 300‚Ç¨ but after adding taxes for the property like ENFIA it's almost the same money) I would normally pay for my lease every month for 25 years and then I will live ""rent free"" (I will finish the payments of my loan).

You're correct.

2680,"&gt;South-Europe wants unlimted  free cash

No, you dummy, Southern Europe CAN NOT EVER fix its economy under the current Eurozone rules. They wouldn't need any cash if the monetary and fiscal unions were thought out better. How do you think countries constantly manage to fix their economies outside a currency union? By using montery tools at the disposal of their central banks, that's how. It happens all the time. But the monetary union stops any country in said union to use those tools, which means they will always be in a limbo. There is one and only one correct answer to this problem - a monetary union requires a fiscal union and a united fiscal policy. That's how the USA does it and does it well. Either they do that or the Eurozone falls apart.

The young man, originally from Italy, was told by a doctor that he was young and healthy and had no reason to worry

uka Di Nikola, 19, of London, passed away due to the effects of a virus corona, days after a doctor told him ""there was no reason to worry"".

 Port, who is a native of Italy, passed away at a hospital in London after his condition worsened on March 23.

 His family claims that the young man was healthy and full of strength, and that he had recently visited a doctor because he had symptoms of the virus corona, but was returned home by the doctor.

 - One week before he exhaled, our Luke had a fever and was coughing.  The same was the case with Luke's mother, my sister-in-law, Clarice.  Luke went to a doctor who told him to drink paracetamol and brought him home - claims the aunt of the deceased young man for La Repubblica.

He says Luke agreed abruptly on March 23.

 - Then the doctor came home and told Luke that he had nothing to worry about, that he was young, strong, healthy and had only stronger flu.

 Unfortunately, Luke was getting worse from time to time.  He complained of severe chest pain, after which he was rushed to hospital.  Doctors managed to revive him once, but his lungs were already too weak.  He soon lost the battle.

 Authorities then quarantined Luke's mother and her partner, as they have similar symptoms as Luke.  No one has tested them yet.",,/r/europe/comments/fs7cqt/so_this_article_says_that_a_19_year_old_italian/flzupmv/,ColonelTarczynski,1585634161

To put an example the US has a %-GDP of about 25 simply because many taxes such as sales tax are recouped by States. This, in turn not only lowers their number but also the average of the OECD.

To add to this many countries have flawed numbers because of their financial systems such as Ireland or the UK. Because of the way their financial systems are set up money bounces from one place to the other, artificially inflating their GDP and in consequence the % of taxes.

I am not saying the tax wedge is perfect, but it is less prone to accidental manipulation due to it coming from the bottom up unlike the %-GDP.",,/r/europe/comments/frnxq9/fellow_european_friends_lets_talk_about_eurobonds/flzjjtf/,TRNVS-QSR,1585625220

&gt; He was persecuted multiple times, sentenced to death multiple times and send to exile multiple times from regimes where nationalists were collaborators (nazi occupation) co governors (post civil war Greece) or outright dictators(military junta). 

He was persecuted for his communistic beliefs not because of any patriotism. The Junta was nationalistic or patriotic, but they didn‚Äôt care if left wingers were because they didn‚Äôt care about that, they cared about communism

&gt; This is the difference beween patriotism and nationalism. Glezos and the left are patriots. Those that want to control Greece are nationalists.

The difference is an modern invention that is constantly changing. Modern day nationalism has become a buzz word associated with ethnic nationalism and chauvinism but originally that is not what it means and was always used interchangeably with patriotism 



Even today nationalism can mean many things for instance and probably closer to its original meaning: advocacy of or support for the political independence of a particular nation or people, which is something historically the Greek left was very strongly in favor for, or at least claimed to be, so they were whether you like it or not nationalists.

If there's any conspiracy here, it is only to be found in the utter stupidity of Ananiev.

&gt; I know jack shit

At least that part of your statement is true.

I already wear a mask. You act as if any criticism towards this measure is born out of a whiny desire not to wear a mask. But the reality is, the measure is unrealistic. People don't have access to masks. The order gives no specific definition of a mask either, which renders the whole order completely useless (technically I can wear a net stocking over my mouth and that would still be considered a mask). There are no masks left at the pharmacies. There are mask shortages for medical professionals. People don't know what to do, and believe me, it's not their fault the order was written as a pompous decree by an irritating buffoon. 

&gt; Medical face masks and similarly styled masks + scarves were never affected by this law. 

The law makes exception for masks, and it doesn't cover scarves, as you typically don't wear a scarf over your nose, but it **does not** make an exception for any other kind of a fabric covering your mouth and nose. So, yes, the law is in direct contradiction with the order, when you consider most people don't even have access to medical masks, and will have to make their own ones.

And while I don't think officers would go after you for wearing a mask in a public place, the mere fact the order *does not explicitly address this issue* demonstrates how much thought has been put into it.

&gt; TV Personalities live on air/radio aren't in public places and they could easily obey the remaining 2 meter rule. 

***THERE IS NO TWO METER RULE!!!*** Now you're spewing complete nonsense, since the order *does not make any exception* for people 2 meters apart. 

If you're in your car, you must wear a mask. If you are out in the wilderness, you must wear a mask. Theoretically, if you are the only resident in your remote village and on the streets, you *must wear a mask*. 

The examples above are a bit unrealistic, but the order explicitly covers both indoor *and outdoor* areas, including places of work. The fact you are making excuses like ""but they can overdub it"" just shows how woefully inadequate your comment is.

2981,"&gt;It's not if they are refugees and not illegal immigrants. Once they get to Greece they all say that they are refugees from a country that's currently in war, they request an asylum and state that they've lost their legal papers (which a refugee can claim because most of them leave their country in a hurry) so they are treated as refugees instead of illegal immigrants.

Normally it doesn't work like that , they have to prove that they were refugees.  There is not a decision or law or policy like that that you say. 

&gt;Why then the Greek economy was so much better with dracmae? I

Actually in the year 2008  we had the biggest rank in the gdp per capita,  but after that the crisis came.  And that's not the first time we got into a crisis,  we had bankrupted many times during the past.  Also during the 1950's Greece was poorer than now, during that time many people couldn't afford to eat meat frequently. 

&gt;Tourism won't stop or be reduced if we leave Europe

It would be more expensive because they would need visa and passport. 

&gt;Everything in the EU has to pass thought the economic powerhouse (Germany), just look at how the Corona bonds were cancelled because Germany said ""Nein"". Currently we have zero powers over the EU and we're not treated as equals, so why should we follow every word they say?

That's not true , there are specific laws and regulations. .  Eurogroup is an informal  body  between  finance ministers of EU  and they have to compromise and agree.  T

Btw I think that Germany said no because they would have to give the more money  ( to pay the bonds) but the would win the less because the money would go to weak economies,  so they would lose money out of this.  



&gt;So the main choices I've got is the party that fucked over our economy (Pasok) or the party that betrayed Greece when they were in power, in 2015 (Syriza).... No thanks I'll pass.

I just answered your question .  But all parties fucked economy,  for example the debt during 2007-2009  (ND) was increased by billions of euros.  Are you referring to a specific event during 2015?

Also ND said that will let businesses that affected by coronavirus, to pay their employees half their salary and making them work half the time they used to work. 

&gt;There are major interests in Greece from both Americans and Chinese so we can use that in our advantage.

But I am not talking only about investments  not even only about trades because they ate our biggest export partners ( we export 53% of products to EU countries), these are  only a small part of what we get,  we also get money directly from EU like billions of euros every year. 

Take a look at this: 2018 figures for Greece:

Total EU spend in Greece ‚Äì ‚Ç¨¬†4.870 billion
(equivalent to 2.66% of the Greek economy)

These money are just given based on the needs of each country . The investments from Americans and Chinese would want an exchange from us in order to invest money here,  but the findings I mentioned in my previous comment come without asking in return.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/fr0j7b/europe_nowadays/flzb2l4/,stefanos916,1585619523

And if you know economics you would know that the easy way for Greece to fix their problems would have been to exit the Eurozone and devalue their currency. IF the plan worked the Greek economy would have recovered if not improved by now.

&gt;I currently have only my car and the lot with my house which is under construction. If I sell my car I won't be able to go to work. The house is the reason I'm been taxed. To buy the lot and build the house I loaned 50.000 from a bank which I pay back in monthly payments of 300‚Ç¨ (just for context, my income is 650‚Ç¨ from my legal job and 300‚Ç¨ from my illegal one, bcvc (before corona virus crisis)). When my house is finished I will move in and save the monthly 350‚Ç¨ that I currently pay for renting an apartment, so probably it's a good long turn investment.


&gt;Not much but I'm been taxed 800-1000‚Ç¨ a year and I've not even finished construction yet (I'm been taxed basically for having a license to build). Property tax in Greece is really high. If I only was rich I wouldn't work 15 hours a day every single day with only Sundays off.

This is spending more then you have and then wondering why you come up short on cash all the time.

Also that type of loan is the reason the 2008 Recession started in the US. 


&gt;Taxing citizens to death works the same way rape works... The enforcer is happy because he sees results and the one that they were enforced upon has thoughts about suicide. But for companies surely... after taxing them they can move in any country they will have most benefits in. Just look how multi billion countries claim they're American but have fabrication facilities in China and their money in countries that are economic heavens.

If there were enough consumer demand for it ‚Äî which there probably isn't for Van Gogh paintings, given that I'd expect them to be a [Veblen good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good), you could have machine-provided painting.

Would need to:

* Have software to infer brushstrokes from existing paintings, if that's to be automated rather than doing something like motion-capture of an expert painting-reproducer.  My understanding is that it's [common in China to have painters hand-reproducing paintings](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-village-60-worlds-paintings-future-jeopardy).

* Figure out how-precisely the painting needs to be a replica of the original.  Conventional printers use mechanisms that are very friendly to precise control over a reproducible process.  My impression is that at least in some painting, complexity in an image is something of an illusion ‚Äî the artist doesn't intend every fine detail, but rather the mechanisms involved in painting introduce noise over which they have limited control, and this noise is interpreted by the eye of the viewer as intentional detail.  For example, if you've ever seen [Bob Ross paint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HvdsIkY9mY), he's introducing a lot of what looks like intentional detail, whereas he does very little actual fine detail work, and rather simply controls the broad characteristics of what's going onto the canvas.  Texture in a tree might be casually squashing a brush onto the canvas, ripples in water the result of only-partially-mixed paints on the palette causing brushstrokes to leave streaks of different colors.

3087,"*They hated Jesus because he told them the truth.*

You're gonna get downvoted to hell but you're obviously right. Especially when you consider how cheap food is here in Italy.  
Cheap canned chickpeas and canned beans go for 30-35 cents per 250g can and they make for great quick salads, dried beans 2‚Ç¨/kg, pasta 55-60 cents, a can of tomato chunks 40 cents, eggs 16-17 cents a piece (even 13 if you're fine with battery chicken eggs, which personally I'm not). Most fresh produce is also 2.5‚Ç¨/kg or less at the supermarket, half that at an open market (but those are closed now so we won't count them).

Sausages can be had for 6‚Ç¨/kg; get half a kg (3‚Ç¨), add half a kg of dried beans (1‚Ç¨), some oil and spices and with 4‚Ç¨ you've got a delicious meal with lots of protein enough for 5-6 servings.  
Cheaper? 1kg of pasta, 2 cans of tomatoes, 8 eggs, 250g worth of various produce to make a salad with the eggs -&gt; again *easily* enough food for 4 people with \~2.5‚Ç¨ and it's still reasonably nutritious and something that you wouldn't mind eating on a normal day anyway.  
Fish fingers can be as cheap as 3‚Ç¨/kg and again, tastes great, children love them, plenty of protein.  
Milk is also super cheap (60 cents/l) and nutritious.

Please stop pretending that *not starving* is soooooo expensive in Italy because that's just factually false. If need be you can reliably feed a family of 4 with 5‚Ç¨/day which is probably what the average poor person spends on cigarettes. Will it be fun and will you get to eat what you want every day?

I'll play devils advocate here, why would you use anything else than google? Their main stretch is their data. Selling them (or getting it stolen) loses their ability to provide personalized ads and go on.  That would be basically a suicide for their business model.

And i still use google there, because i get ""fresh"" non personalized results, same as in DDG or Qwant and google gets exactly the same information about me as they would get from qwant, but qwant gets nothing. So we are skipping middleman and another point where security breach may happen. Right now if google sells their data, they lose way more than they would get. In other hand qwant, ddg etc only say this magic buzzword PRIVACY (USE VPN NOW, 5$ 2 months free REEE), while having almost no real guarantee of delivering this. Its just their word and customers trusting them. NordVPN anyone?

[The UK imported 535,000 tonnes of cheese in 2019, and exported 208,000, leading to a deficit of 327,900 tonnes.](https://ahdb.org.uk/dairy/uk-cheese-trade) [In 2018 the UK produced 465,000 tonnes of cheese](https://www.farminguk.com/news/british-wine-and-cheese-see-bumper-decade-of-growth_54670.html). Therefore the UK consumes 792,000 tonnes a year. Or 198,000 tonnes a quarter.

27,000 is roughly 13.5% of 198,000. So Irish cheese makes up 13.5% of all the cheese eaten in the UK.

Though if (as has been mentioned elsewhere), most of the cheese used in UK McDonalds is Irish, that will take up a not-insignificant percentage of the amount imported into the UK. So probably less than 13.5% is actually on UK shop shelves.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/frq63m/sales_of_irish_cheese_slump_75_due_to_coronavirus/flykdel/,Speech500,1585603785

3337,"&gt; Not taking sides here, but you cannot conclude that wearing masks is the reason for the difference in spread of the virus. Correlation =! causation.

But you can't prove it's not. And in such danger we face nowadays - better be safe.

&gt; A cough or sneeze through those masks apparently does not stop the virus. 

It does, both size and distance of the spread. Of course partially. But compared to not wearing a mask - difference is major.

I wear a mask since ~10 days (in public places), and today I was busy cleaning my flat, enough to get sneezing from all the dust. So I used this to experiment, put the mask on, and kept a mirror by myself. Sneeze came, did it straight into the mask in front of mirror (~20 cm) - next to no droplets.

Are masks some miracle which will save us all? Nope, some other solutions are way more important (especially the holy three: stay home, wash hands, social distancing). But can they help?

3345,"An architectonical development attends the needs of a function. European churches during Romanesque period (1000-1200s) were getting bigger and bigger, but where limited by technology. During the 1200s there were a group of technological breakthroughs that allowed structures to be taller and lighter, so bigger windows and taller rooms. This gave to the creation of Gothic architecture. Better technology enabled artisans to make things more detailed and pretty, making the typical Gothic designs. This was made for churches of the Latin Church. It wasnt a French thing, it just started in France. There was no national value into it. There was not the idea of a country or state by then. Gothic was an European thing since it was the evolution of previous methods to build churches.

On the other hand, Byzantium in 500s was a proper state, where there was a religious leader (Patriarch) and Emperor, who decided to create a massive monocentric construction where to show the power of the Empire and how Christianity was centred in Constantinople. Constantinople did not have any Christian religious background, unlike the other patriarchates: Rome is where Peter died, Antioch where the apostoles decided to spread out, Jerusalem the home of Jesus and Alexandria a centre of Christian knowledge. So they needed to create the largest church in the world to show authority. They needed a great internal room, that made architects use superposing wide arches with a low dome on top. The base had to be very thick, making it look very robust. Typical Roman architectonical elements were synthesized with more local Anatolian elements. Thats how form and details gave the Byzantine architecture its particularities from then on. But the Turks said in the 1500s ""oh such cool building, lets cntl+c and cntl+v with blue stuff to make it look more Turkish"".

An embargo is needed to stop the attacking side (Haftar) to continue the military conflict in Lybia by getting endlessly restocked of war tools. A conflict which isn't going anywhere as the defending side (GNA) is also getting restocked to don't fall.  
  
But the moment an embargo is really put in action that's when the two sides will be limited to the war tools they already own, or which are able to manifacture themselves.  
The aim of an embargo is to limit the ability of any side involved to increase their military activity, by limiting the same tools they use to wage war.  
In that sense, a step further from a simple limitation of new weapons arrivals (embargo), is to seize the weapons still laying around on the field and remove them, to further remove from the players involved the ability to wage any war at all.",,/r/europe/comments/fr8zh5/french_navy_intercepts_turkish_ship_carrying/flxtcsh/,zeando,1585589450

However, the younger portion isolating addresses a different input into deaths ‚Äî no country has enough ICUs/ventilators for everyone who will need them to survive.  The more-slowly the disease spreads, the more time there is for people to be placed on those and recover.  And the higher the level of isolation across society, the slower the spread.

3411,"AWAGATE FOREST, MALI ‚Äî For two days, dozens of armored vehicles carrying 180 elite soldiers with the French Foreign Legion lumbered over West Africa‚Äôs scrubby savanna to reach a suspected hide-out for Islamist militants.
Finally, by a thicket of acacia trees, the legionnaires spotted a turbaned suspect in flip-flops, carrying an AK-47, who set off at a sprint and melted away in the distance. The soldiers found only his gun, boots, and ammunition holster under a thorny fence, and presented the findings to their officer.
‚ÄúA bit of a modest result,‚Äô‚Äô said Col. Nicolas Meunier, commanding officer of the French desert battle group.
When France sent its forces into Mali, a former French colony, after armed Islamists took control of the West African country‚Äôs northern cities, their mission was supposed to last only a few weeks.
That was seven years ago.
Since then, the terrorist threat has spread across a vast sweep of land south of the Sahara known as the Sahel, and France‚Äôs counterterrorism fight has spread with it. As a result, more than 10,000 West Africans have died, over a million have fled their homes and military forces from West Africa and France have suffered many losses.
And still, the battle is hardly finished. The Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, a potent armed group with loose ties to the Islamic State, has been conducting sophisticated attacks in the border regions of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. In the past four months, militants have raided four major military outposts in Mali and Niger, killing 300 soldiers.

France now finds itself stuck in the Sahel, much like the United States found itself in Afghanistan and Iraq ‚Äî spending years and billions of dollars on fighting highly mobile Islamist groups in difficult, unfamiliar terrain, with no end in sight.
French President Emmanuel Macron threatened, ahead of an emergency summit meeting with West African presidents in January, to pull his troops out. Later, he doubled down on the mission, promising to deploy additional 600 soldiers to join the 4,500 already there. He also committed to work more closely with the militaries of African countries to get them better prepared to stave off attacks, and take some of the load off French shoulders.
But the task is enormous. The allies are divided by language, culture and experience.
At a French military camp outside the ancient Malian city of Gao, 15 Malian soldiers were being instructed by French airmen in how to give accurate directions to planes over the radio. The Malians‚Äô mission was to guide a pretend fighter pilot to a pretend terrorist den ‚Äî a rust-colored house, just like all the others in the city.
West African security forces have little of the equipment, training or even basic education that their French counterparts do. Most of the Malian soldiers said they had never seen a compass before, and they kept getting their directions wrong. They tested each other on the powdery sand, an empty cigarette packet marking north, a plastic cup for south.
The militants are far from defeated, with one group even managing to kidnap the politician who leads Mali‚Äôs main opposition party last week near Timbuktu.
The African Union recently said it would send 3,000 soldiers to the Sahel, and France has been trying to recruit new allies; Estonia and the Czech Republic have already signed up to send troops, while talks are continuing with Sweden, Finland and Norway.

But just as the French, Europeans and West Africans are ramping up the fight, the Trump administration is considering withdrawing American troops and closing a new air base in Niger that the Americans had built at the cost of $110 million. Some American officials have said they want to concentrate instead on confronting China and Russia.

The French defense minister, Florence Parly, flew to Washington in late January to plead for the Americans‚Äô continued support.
French military officers interviewed in Mali and Niger last month on the runway of an air base, in the cockpit of a transport plane and in a drone control room said they are concerned about the annual loss of $45 million worth of transportation, air refueling and drones that the U.S. contributes to the French mission, which costs $1 billion annually.
But General Pascal Facon, the commander of the French mission, said in an interview that European and African armies could ‚Äúeasily‚Äù conquer the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara. Unlike the Islamic State at its height in Syria and Iraq, ISGS does not hold any territory and has no long roots in local communities, he said.
‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt underestimate them,‚Äù said General Facon. ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt give them too much importance either.‚Äù
French troops first came to Mali at the request of Mali‚Äôs government. Although they are there to defend Malian civilians, the two groups have very little interaction.
A foot patrol of French soldiers, fully covered in flak jackets, helmets, sunglasses and half-balaclavas, skirted around a nomadic family of women and children who were packing or unpacking their hut made of sticks and handwoven mats, and their few belongings ‚Äî some plastic containers, a cooking pot.
Was the family coming or going, and why? The soldiers could not ask. They had no common language. And if militants found out the family had spoken to them, the family could be killed.
When some Malian teens begged a Foreign Legion convoy for cookies, they blocked the convoy‚Äôs path, delaying them for half an hour. The boys got no cookies. In another incident, a legionnaire pointed his gun at some locals who tried to jump on the back of an armored vehicle.
The battle has taken a toll on everyone. France‚Äôs defense minister said last year that the army had killed 600 jihadists since 2015. In February, Niger announced that 120 militants had been killed, and the French military recently announced that an additional 50 were killed in Central Mali.
But France has lost 44 soldiers since 2013, including 13 in a helicopter accident last year; Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso have lost hundreds in multiple attacks on military encampments.

A fleet of fighter jets, drones, transport planes and helicopters has given the French a significant advantage, and they are often able to scatter armed groups just by flying low and aggressively over them. But even if local armies were in a position to take over, chasing terrorists from desert to dry river bed to acacia forest is not enough to bring peace to the region, experts say.
‚ÄúThe military solution is absolutely necessary, but insufficient,‚Äù said Lori-Anne Theroux-Benoni, director of the Institute for Security Studies, in Dakar, and co-author of a recent report on violence in the region. ‚ÄúEveryone is mesmerized by the level of violence,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand therefore not focusing enough on prevention.‚Äù
The armed groups have enjoyed such success largely because they have exploited deep anger against the state governments, which many in the region say they see as hostile, self-interested and corrupt. Their militaries are often accused of feeding these grievances, by committing grave human rights abuses against the population.
Anti-France demonstrations, held mostly by residents of Bamako, the Malian capital, over the past six months have attracted French ire.
It is unclear at what point France will consider its work to be done, or get frustrated, and leave. Should it follow America‚Äôs example and get out?
‚ÄúIn the same way that French reality TV and pop music is 15 years behind the U.S., French counterterrorism mimics U.S. counterterrorism of 15 years ago,‚Äù said Hannah Armstrong, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. ‚ÄúIn the Sahel, the Americans have already realized this is a losing battle.‚Äù

In most cases, the militants hear the long noisy convoys of the French Foreign Legion from miles away, and clear out. French commanders recognize this. They say that the idea is to keep the armed groups on the run, so they cannot settle in with the local population.
The suspected terrorist in flip-flops apparently did not hear the convoy coming, but by the time the soldiers could maneuver their vehicles to the tangle of trees where they last saw him, he was long gone ‚Äî perhaps blending in with the local population.
The locals are usually too terrified to give up any suspects, knowing that when the armies have moved on, anyone who helped the military can be executed. There are no police and no courts to protect them.
The legionnaires saw a family duck into their hut. A few nomads herding camels strode past. Could the man who fled be among them? The French troops could not tell.",France,/r/europe/comments/frsgp9/crisis_in_the_sahel_becoming_frances_forever_war/flxfiq7/,Fandechichoune,1585581876
3412,"&gt;The reality is: the northern countries benefited more from the EU, but in the last decade they never admitted it. The north will never ""let the south"" to themselves because their current positive economy is thanks to them too.

The QE-policies of the ECB have been squarely aimed at helping the likes of Italy and Spain. You think that huge inflation is a benefit to countries with relatively little debt and large savings in joint public/private pensions? To sustain these pensions in light of ECB policies, retirement ages in many northern countries has gone up and up to nearly 70. And yet we see France can't even agree to raise their 52 (!) retirement age for public transport workers. It's beyond shameful.

Playing by the Euro rules means making choices where you spend that money. Germany has made those choices, but some people in France and Spain seem to think they don't have to. So far, they've been right. They can run huge deficits and debts and the ECB and EU will continue to bail them out.

3470,"Excellent. Let me also add:

Spain has one of the largest support rates in the EU, even after the 2008 crisis, which it is still ongoing due to the debt burden (and high interest rates that other countries benefit from). This didn't affect the views of the EU because most Spanish citizen accepted that Spanish politicians and their management had a great responsibility in generating that crisis. However, the population also changed. It unwillingly accepted austerity without making a big drama, it became more responsible and things are considerably different to what they were in 2008. Just before the coronavirus crisis, the country was growing at one of the fastest rates in Europe and was generating surplus (mostly to pay back debt).

Now, the current crisis has nothing to do with management. In fact austerity has played a larger role by taking a dent in the health system. The latest arguments about financial incapabilities of Spain and tales of old times (from 12 years ago) are inappropriate, inaccurate and unacceptable. Spain does not want a blank check-book or indefinite Eurobonds. Spain is asking for a one-time only Marshall plan, or coronabonds to share the burden of a health crisis. Sharing this burden will benefit all of the EU in the mid and long term. Failing to do this will possibly turn tables (at least in Spain) in EU support. It will likely be a tipping point.

&gt;Please explain that to me...

Well long story short two things: 

First they got 2/3 majority in 2010  in a totally fair way. Then they used this power to write a new constitution and an election law, that allowed them to get 2/3 (basically total power) again in 2014 with as low as 42% of the total votes.

The other thing is they use crazy amounts of government money to spread propaganda. So they have the less educated part of the population basically in their pockets. Also some of the midclass too with their ""family-friendly"" policies and awaiting everyone with open arms in their system if you yourself want some dirty money also.

This second thing basically guarantees them 40%+ support which means full power for them. And you can say a a lot of bad things about Hungary, but it's not like you don't have this 40% in other countries too... Just look at the UK or USA. If you are able to make an electoral system like that, you can basically do that in any country, let alone Eastern-Europe.

I hear a lot that ""a crisis is not the right time""  to address such issues. 

That's half the truth thought.   
The other half is that even in good times some,  were again not willing to address further integration, fiscal transfers and how it could/should  be done.  Were they waiting for a perfect world and a perfect time to do it while singing Kumbaya holding hands? C'mon.... 

It will never be a proper time cause the goal of the EU's been abandoned.  

I remember during the 80s how strong the will for the ultimate goal was. Not any longer (again for some).

Some do find the status quo  as the ideal one, refusing to see that for many others it isn't so.   


As incompetent some governments have been in the south **for not taking the political effort and risk to clean their house,** exactly the same incompetence showed northern governments **for not taking the political effort and risk to explain to their voters** that  the Union is more than currency and economy, what they  are going to gain and why the current situation creates imbalances and can't go on for more.   
As their southern counterparts they use ""today"" to gain votes, whatever today means. They forgot the ultimate goal and refuse to talk about it.

Yes the current situation is creating massive flow of wealth for south to the north. 

The north then comes to the ""rescue"". This rescue is only temporary thought since the euro is an incomplete currency . Common currency but not common economic policy, no fiscal transfers to ensure the growth of poorer areas etc.  People  wondering why and their politicians tell them ""they used the money on women and booze"". Surely they'll be angry.   
People in the south face huge difficulties and humiliation and surely they get angry. 

The political elite in the north is to blame as much as the political elite in the south.  

  
I'm a life long federalist but I'm becoming more and more pessimistic that I will  ever see a true Union.

I'm afraid I will continue to see every external power that wishes to push around the EU at will and divide it.

When Poland was joining the EU, Poles were sceptical. You could see and hear the same arguments that were thrown during Brexit - loss of sovereignty, German invasion by diplomacy, we will be paying shit ton to EU etc. To combat that we had a lot of propaganda. From that time I still remember what I was taught in school - that EU means open borders, free trade, easy travel and exports/imports. There was even TV show called ""Europa da siƒô lubiƒá"" (""Europe can be liked"") on national TV with guests from different countries talking about their country culture. There was a whole year or two of shows, lessons and general propaganda about how EU is not loss of sovereignty and how much we will gain from membership.

After joining it slowly died out, even most pro-EU parties decided that it's much better to put their name on everything that is built with EU backing. Standard political thinking you would say.

Now we have anti-EU party. There is barely any anti-EU propaganda, but you can be sure as hell every time EU does something we may not like, it will be in national TV/press. It all died out a bit now, after Brexit and with coronavirus going on. 

And to be honest - I can assure you, our totalitarian, populist, anti-EU party is going to win this year election.

The EU has no budget and no existing mechanism; it can't do much providing for countries since Europe's public money is overwhelmingly in the hands of national budgets. (The EU does have influence on these budget but it's still national money.)

The link you gave shows this: The European Parliament's response is a mere ‚Ç¨37 billions, when individual member states are each pumping up to the hundreds.

What it *can* do is to not get in the way of nations, which it did by lifting budget rules, have the ECB do a lot of quantitative easing and secure the bonds spread, and have the European Council decide how countries most affected by the virus are going to be helped by other countries, through e.g. Coronabonds.

People did hear about all of these points quite extensively, at least over here. You'll notice that most of them involve not getting in the way, and two of them sparked a scandal.

Please reflect for a moment on what you are saying here. You lable them selfish, you say they dont care... You condem them to die. I was looking at a picture of a lady walking by herself. This is where the rhetoric is taking your attitude towards your fellow man. 

While most of us may get ill, few of us will die and the majority of those are in high risk groups; so stepping out the door and walking around at distance from other people isn't quite the walking dead scenario you imagine. The only other person in that picture is the policeman; is that the best example of murderous non-compliance they could find ;)

I really want personal responsibility to still count for something, abdicating it all to centralized punitive enforcement is very very dangerous. It papers over the lack of trust and compassion in society... And highlights, even endorses, the poor education and lack of critical thinking. 

If the restrictions allowed for you to go about normally if you had taken appropriate ppe that would be great. The vast majority of free citizens in the world are isolating themselves with little fuss. You are being shown any example of non compliance available around the world because it gets your blood boiling and that's all the media needs to keep you turned and that good enough for them.

I am not making light of the virus situation, I take it very seriously but don't want to see it used as a way for the media to drive further wedges of mistrust into society.

4108,"&gt; Other countries like Austria ( I think) denied immigrant visa and other countries didn't boycotted them. Also if immigrants are illegal then even we don't close the boarders their visas won't be accepted either way.

We can't just deny immigrants because they come here and claim that come from a country currently at war but they lost the necessary paperwork to prove it and we can't send them back in that country because they will deny them -hint- they are not from there (it's like someone tells them what to say before they come here to apply for asylum in Greece, also when the NGOs were kicked out of the islands the immigrants stopped coming, I don't think that's a coincidence since the money NGOs get from the EU depend on the number of immigrants). I've friends that served in the army in Lesbos and have seen everything you can imagine (people overturning their boats so that Greeks are forced to save them, mothers throwing into the sea their kids, using them as a shield by taking cover under them etc.).

&gt;They pay employees here and the money that they win here are being taxed by Greece...

Every company when they aquire an asset they assess how much time it would take them to start profiting and form where they can start cut corners (layoffs). I've yet to see an ex public asset now controlled by private company hire more people than it used to have when it was public. And the wages that get taxed already applies when the company is a public asset so I don't see a difference by privatizing it (but with the layoffs there will be less employees to tax).

&gt; done by the party that you currently support ND 

Can you name one party that doesn't support privatization and is not an extreme one? I can't.

&gt; The money goes back to them ,( not even to them but to companies of their countries) because our government choose to hire their companies for specific works.

Well they're counted as a net benefit for that country and not Greece but good point about been our governments decision. The thing is that these projects (like the  metro in Athens or Thessaloniki) are **partially** financed by the EU (you can read about it in those signs they put up near the projects and if not all most of them write co-sponsored by the Greek state and the EU ([an example](https://attikosparatiritis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/2014-02-11-13-03-37.jpg)) so we pay them as well and because they start by a high bid and companies bid lower (they will demand less money for the same project) they will accept the lowest one. The EU gives us a certain amount of money for a project, it's up to the rest of us (Greek taxpayer) to pay for the rest.

4177,"&gt; I don't disagree with that . They give a certain amount and without them we as taxpayers would have to pay it all....

I see what you mean. So in the end in any case our government would choose the cheapest bid because aren't intelligent enough to see that the longer gains of hiring Greek companies (increasing the liquid cash in the domestic market but spending a bit more) outweigh the short gains that hiring a foreign company  provides (cheaper hiring but provides minimal gains for the domestic market). I can agree with this.

&gt; The EU doesn't require us to accept them...

Well that's partially true. If the NGOs want EU money they have to find immigrants and our borders are vast enough that we can't guard them like other countries can guard theirs (the sea vast borders we have). A boat can easily slip pass to the Greek side and unload on an island before anyone notices. The only reason that we don't have illegal entries now is because a large chunk of our military and police units from all across Greece were relocated in the borders (Komotini has 6 police units left).
Last year there were tens of thousands illegal entries (50000 of them were relocated in the mainland because the islands were full) and that's when things were good and not the 2015-2016 situation. We can't just stop everyone because we can't build a fence like we did with Albania.

Anyway I think that some countries didn't support it because these bonds aren't free and we would have to pay pay them back to the markets but with interests, so they didn't consider it a good idea and some other people might wanted to compromise so to decide for something which is beneficial for everyone.

4216,"&gt; Okay, but if we weren't part of EU we would get nothing, so based on this you can see why it's better for us to stay and still that covers a good period of time and most immigrants now have left the borders, so I guess that now we need less money. 

We didn't get any money until now and I think we're the only country in the EU that has a casus belli from a country next door that wants to get into the EU. We spending billions (there was a graph and we were the second country in expenses for national defense per capita, right after Cyprus (not sure about that, feel free to fact check me) right here, in r/europe a couple weeks ago) which not a penny was ever funded by the EU.


&gt; They didn't gave their rights, our government sold them for money for a specific period if time, that's called privatization and it was between our country and a company but the funding I am talking about is about EU not from companies . Also privatization isn't a requirement in order to take those money. 

That's basically giving their rights. When you rent an apartment the landlord is giving you the rights for the apartment. These companies are not Greek so the money they make are not going to be taxed in Greece because they're not Greek. That's how many companies in Hollywood avoid paying American taxes.

&gt; So you are saying.... 

A drug dealer has interest into hooking up his ""friends"" first with cheap drugs so they will get addicted and then upgrade them into harder and more expensive stuff. Never blindly trust someone that's got interest into you. 

Selling our sources of income to companies they tax for a quick buck so we can pay our next loan payment is not a good long turn plan because we will run out of stuff to sell, and if by any chance we manage to get out of this shithole we've buried ourselves into, we won't have any source of income so we will get loans once again to survive. 

&gt; Also if we weren't part of EU we would still owe and be obliged to pay our loans, but we wouldn't get any help like fundings.

Our fundings don't help in any way with paying our loans, taxing Greeks to hell and back and selling public companies do. If we weren't a part of the EU they wouldn't be able to extort us with our currency like they did in 2015 and we would be able to have more freedom with our laws (we could close our borders years ago) like the UK has.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/fr0j7b/europe_nowadays/flvie9p/,Oligarchic_Rabbit,1585524477

&gt;  
&gt;So many times, the health personnel in the country's intensive care units, which are currently treating patients with Covid-19, must measure the amount of oxygen in their patients' blood and manually adjust the oxygen supply from oxygen devices.  
&gt;  
&gt;Oxygen therapy should prevent patients' lungs from becoming so fluid and sore that the patient ends up in one of the nation's 1,060 respirators. But the important treatment is time-consuming, because each time the healthcare professional spends precious time putting on equipment and taking necessary safety precautions when going to patients.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- You must wear both mouthwrap, gloves and insulation gown. And then you also have to wash hands and splash out and through the locker room, so it can take a few minutes just to get ready to get in and out of the patient, so that part costs time, says Charlotte Sandau, a specialist nurse at Hvidovre Hospital.  
&gt;  
&gt;Time goes from other core tasks, but a new oxygen robot developed in collaboration between Hvidovre Hospital, Denmark and the Danish company 02Matic, however, has been shown to improve the oxygen treatment and at the same time save the health personnel a lot of time.  
&gt;

i need to read more in to this to understand the technical limitations of this combination of government money + second job. but i guess the limit of government money + farmer job money combined is my last net income.

4290,"&gt; No. Where did I say that? Or imply it?

Over here: 'You can afford it, just not as often', and here 'Wants and needs are two different'.

&gt; But do we need new computers as often

Yes. Otherwise we'll quickly lag behind others and business, therefore workplaces, will move to Asia. This will result in poverty. This is why climate deals have to be global, and why it's China and USA who should do their part first.

&gt; Do we really _need_ oranges

Of course not. Soylent diet.

&gt; Telephone calls are cool. Loads of potential to save on unnecessary travel - except, well, we kinda don't.

Especially to the hospital. Good luck calling an ambulance without access to a phone made for private calls.

&gt; We never had any plague spread as fast to each and every country on this planet.

Technically that's true, but total number of affected people is very, very, very low. It was a different story with the Spanish Flu.

&gt; That is just plain wrong. Without biodiversity our soils degrade; we lose all the work that insects and microorganisms do

Have you ever been on a farm?

&gt; And you are so fixated on a black and white thinking of an all or nothing kind.

Because for me it is all or nothing. When you fly a few times a year and you hear it's too much, it is all or nothing.

Sure, but you can't just tell people not to do things and give no alternative. I can use less plastic bags if you give me a cotton bag. I can stop buying batteries if you give me rechargable ones.

- you can also buy bonds with negative interest rate in order to sell them later in the secondary market, if you believe its value will increase. That's for speculation.

4554,"&gt; Didn't read this part?

I have, but that's what you're proposing, not what Italy and Spain want. I agree that this would be a good solution, but it would mean the EU taking over certain parts of national budgets, which is a political suicide at the moment and would never be approved by national governments. 

While I applaud Italy for the measures they've taken to reduce their debt pre-2008, their debt should never get that high in the first place, and they were still running deficits even in their best years. A responsible fiscal policy would mean surpluses or at least a balanced budget in the best years, so that there's room for massive stimulus when a recession happens (this is what Germany did, and now their response to covid-19 was a stimulus worth 15% (!) of their GDP, and more are likely to follow). I know that almost none of this is the fault of the current generation of Italians, and it's totally unfair that you have inherited this burden from previous generations, but it's even less of a fault of fiscally responsible nations who would be slightly hurt economically and massively hurt politically if they agreed to debt mutualization without EU control. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But keep telling yourself whatever excuses to be selfish and only care for yourselves 

I am not German or from any of those fiscally responsible countries, in fact, my country was pretty irresponsible until late. I also consider Italy to be the bedrock of EU and we have a joint responsibility to help them, now more than ever. As I said, I would love to see a bigger EU budget financed by common bonds, but I don't think this will happen anytime soon. I agree that helping Italy now would be an investment and I really want to help them, but it almost surely can't be done by debt mutualization.

We are fighting the same invisible enemy and the human and logistical resources of our war are not unlimited, but today we cannot keep the reserve forces waiting to be called while in Italy, where Albanians wounded by the enemy are also being treated in war hospitals, they have a huge need for help.

It is true that everyone is locked up within their borders, even rich countries have turned their backs on the others, but perhaps because we are not rich but also not without memory, we cannot afford not to show Italy that the Albanians and Albania never abandon their friend in difficulty.

4930,"&gt;Krzysztof Eugeniusz Penderecki¬†(Polish:¬†[Ààk Ç…® Çt…îf p…õnd…õÀàr…õtÕ°sk ≤i]; born 23 November 1933) is a Polish composer and¬†conductor.¬†The Guardian¬†has called him Poland's greatest living composer.[1]¬†Among his best known works are¬†Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima,¬†Symphony No. 3, his¬†St. Luke Passion,¬†Polish Requiem,¬†Anaklasis¬†and¬†Utrenja. Penderecki composed four operas, eight symphonies and other orchestral pieces, a variety of instrumental concertos, choral settings of mainly religious texts, as well as chamber and instrumental works.

&gt;Born in¬†Dƒôbica¬†to a lawyer, Penderecki studied music at¬†Jagiellonian University¬†and the¬†Academy of Music in Krak√≥w. After graduating from the Academy of Music, Penderecki became a teacher at the academy and he began his career as a composer in 1959 during the¬†Warsaw Autumn¬†festival. His¬†Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima¬†for¬†string orchestra¬†and the choral work¬†St. Luke Passion, have received popular acclaim. His first opera,¬†The Devils of Loudun, was not immediately successful. Beginning in the mid-1970s, Penderecki's composing style changed, with his first violin concerto focusing on the¬†semitone¬†and the¬†tritone. His choral work¬†Polish Requiem¬†was written in the 1980s, with Penderecki expanding it in 1993 and 2005.

&gt;Penderecki has won many prestigious awards, including the Commander's Cross in 1964, the¬†Prix Italia¬†in 1967 and 1968, the Knight's Cross of the¬†Order of Polonia Restituta¬†in 1964, four¬†Grammy Awards¬†in 1987, 1998 (twice), and 2017,¬†Wolf Prize in Arts¬†in 1987 and the¬†University of Louisville¬†Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition¬†in 1992.[2]

Then, when you compare Europe to the US, it‚Äôs the fact that Europe is more densely populated. If you look at the US as well, the most affected areas are very densely populated like for example NYC. 

Regarding the healthcare system, what people don‚Äôt understand is that infectious diseases especially something like COVID-19 are a completely different beast than what healthcare systems in developed countries are used to dealing with. Like most infectious diseases are rather easy to avoid, like keeping good hygiene and avoiding contact with bodily fluids of infected people. 

Finally, it‚Äôs the fact that it‚Äôs just not possible to have a China style lockdown in Europe. People in the free world generally don‚Äôt like being told what to do. Some are conspiracy theorists. Many others don‚Äôt believe the virus is that bad or just don‚Äôt care because ‚Äúit kills only old people‚Äù. Most others do fear the virus but think their reason for going out is more important and worth the risk. In addition, European countries just don‚Äôt have the human and logistical resources to enforce a China style lockdown. Like in Wuhan at some point they set up tents in front of residential buildings to control how often people went out and restrict them to three times per week. Imagine that happening in Europe. In my country they barely have enough manpower to control traffic on the main roads, there are still many residential areas where the police rarely come and many people still go out without a proper reason, gather in groups, don‚Äôt respect social distancing etc.",,/r/europe/comments/fr209a/why_do_you_think_the_coronavirus_is_spreading_so/fltibfo/,crocodilau,1585474108

&gt; The limit of ¬£2500 to sit at home while supermarket staff are poorly paid with massive risk of infection is immoral... no one should be getting paid more than the value of a universal credit claim for being furloughed.

Truer words were never spoken. This crisis has really revealed how totally craven modern media is. If it gets clicks, it's what is written. Nothing else matters. I read very little about this crisis because almost every article I have read has been so full of bullshit it's hard to stomach. And it's always the worst possible take, the most alarming possibility is the one that is presented, and any kind of rational, calm, most-likely answer is ignored in favour of the most panic-inducing one.

5026,"As a whole this is not about Europe. This pandemic shows how unprepared financially any country is for a pandemic, shows how shit filled and stupid some governments are over people who are suffering physically, emotionally, and financially due to the pandemic. 

This puts finances, morals, out right human values and how societies work into the light. 

It‚Äôs not about Europe, it‚Äôs about the sustainability of local, national, and international structures. Even though we are a part of a union we cannot put all our trust and rely on it, but when we hit a crisis that union has to have the capacity to respond immediately in some extent. It‚Äôs like you can‚Äôt always rely on others to help you out with trouble but also it is humane to be there and be ready to help another human being in need. But everything has a maximum capacity. 

The worst thing is that we want to save everyone, no one wants to die out of a virus, but we can‚Äôt save everyone. However the lack of preparedness, emergency funds/preparations, or foresightedness will contribute to the death of many. 

It‚Äôs time to question economy and governments. How is it that large companies get financial aid considering the amount of money said companies make and should have for a rainy day? Why don‚Äôt they have funds but average people, even those with minimum pay, are expected to have money for 90 days‚Äô living costs considering many make barely enough money to pay their monthly living costs in the first place (due to the high cost of living versus low pay in many places).
 How is it that the government does not prioritize financially the people who keep the system running, those people who pay a good chunk of taxes for social services, healthcare, and the government in general?

And at the end, whatever the results may be, those with less income will suffer for a while financially while a good small percent still walk around with billions. And government‚Äôs decision on how to recover is to tax the shit out of the middle and lower class. 

What is happening now is because no one prepared for it thinking it could never happen and now people are whining how no one outside is helping out. The reason no country began to react with hard decisions early on was due to the **cost** of said actions and now this is the result whilst still costing everyone a shit ton. 

It‚Äôs not about the European Union, it‚Äôs about that fact that no one prepared, no one reacted soon enough mostly due to the economy. For which funnily in US some say the older generation should die for. 

We didn‚Äôt want to risk the economy with slight preparedness and safety measures when there was an unknown virus spreading like wildfire and now we‚Äôre paying for it with the economy, physical and mental health, individuals‚Äô finances, and some people are paying with their lives.",,/r/europe/comments/fqmnwc/spanish_representative_gonz√°lez_pons_speech_the/fltcg41/,Riksunraksu,1585467036

There is no link in Germany between voting for AfD and age anymore, these talking points have got to be four years old at this point and were only true in the Anglosphere. 

https://m.dw.com/en/who-votes-for-germanys-far-right-party-afd-not-who-youd-think/a-47793722

&gt;A study has flipped the script on the well-worn story that mostly the poor, the uneducated, and the elderly vote for populists. Only one indicator matters: whether someone thinks immigration is bad for Germany.

https://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/record-numbers-of-young-voters-backed-afd-in-thuringia-state-election/

&gt;In the Thuringia elections, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) continued to seduce young voters. With 24% of the young people voting in favour of the far-right party, the AfD became the strongest force among the under-30s.

Even more stark in Italy, where it's mostly the old farts who vote for the same party they have for decades:

https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/world/are-younger-voters-really-the-best-defence-against-populism

&gt;In Italy, however, over 60 per cent of millennials voted for a party in the Italian populist coalition. Lega‚Äôs popularity with young people in the south helped catapult the party from a regional group to a national powerhouse.

Nope.

Herd immunity is what will emerge if the virus is not contained, because that is what will ultimately stop the spread.  It has not been contained, ergo all of these countries are going to see it emerge.

It's not a ""strategy"".  Its just what's going to happen if the virus isn't contained.  None of those countries are going to eliminate the virus prior to that happening.

What they *are* attempting to do is flatten the curve, to reduce the peak number of infected and let hospitals save more, to reduce the proportion of elderly who get it.

&gt;Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?

&gt;**The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing**. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.

[As for the location](https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/policie-zabavila-statisice-rousek-narazila-pritom-na-prekvapive-jmeno-94008) this article, for example, names the place - [Lovosice](https://i.imgur.com/Ij8VCFc.png), a **place in the middle of nowhere with the masks having no reason whatsoever to be there**. Unclear how and why they even got there. Also worth mentioning is that in the same warehouse the police found other ~~500k~~ 680k\* face masks that actually were stolen and have been rightfully seized.

I'm deeply sorry that our officials made a mistake that potentially caused some Italian people their lives but as you can see, the entire thing was strange, to say the least, and had to be resolved. I wish our government decided to err on the 'safer' side and sent the 101k that was meant for Italy. Sadly, that did not happen.

I also have to say I was surprised to see how much Italians despise us.

5192,"&gt;  leave your home if you have any symptoms (including  runny nose or cough)

How is this enforced? Sweden tell people to stay at home if they are sick.

&gt;If anybody in your household has a fever, NOBODY is allowed to leave.

Here we are different. It's only once YOU have symptoms you're supposed to stay at home.

&gt;bars and restaurants have been closed for a week now.

Not closed, but in Sweden they have changed so you can only have table service, effectively closing a lot of bars.

&gt;all gatherings (= more than 3 people not from the same household) are banned, with a few exceptions (legal meetings like parliament and muncipal council (100 people max), weddings &amp; funerals (30 people max), and meetings necesary for essential services (max 100 people)). People hese exceptions need to maintain 1.5m distance.

Here we are different, we've only banned public gatherings (that you need to apply for, like a concert, demonstration, etc) for 50 or more. We had 500 as a limit before, but even that led to a lot of smaller events being closed, gyms being closed, etc. While we do not enforce stuff by law, it usually trickles down to the owners taking responsibility.

&gt;occupations requiring close contact (barbers, massage studios, etc) have to close down. Only exception is medical occupations.

Not applied here.

&gt;markets are basically closed: they can only happen when 1.5m distance can be enforced

Goes on like normal, some stores enforce a strict distance between customers. In my local market they give away gloves when you enter and give you hand sanitizer.

&gt;(which have both, so far, done very little - aside from non-enforced 'recommendations' and 'discouragements')

Think you've missed what UK did. But Sweden have removed a sick leave day where you don't get paid, you do not need to have proof of illness for 3 weeks, removed some taxes to help businesses survive, etc. Then we have ofc done a lot of recommendations and discouragements, which are, on a grander scale, being followed by most.",,/r/europe/comments/fqry8g/we_need_to_talk_about_sweden_coronavirus_deaths/flt9277/,EnLilaSko,1585463362

that could be a problem in some countries. at least here in the uk, double decked trains were dismissed because a lot of places have really low clearance, so we‚Äôd have to build whole new lines for them. new high speed lines (HS2) are being built with this in mind, but old lines that are basically a straight line (so they can reasonably accommodate high speed trains) won‚Äôt get the same treatment. take a look at the great western mainline, it shouldn‚Äôt have any problem handling 300km/h trains even though it was built in the 1800s (bless our lord and saviour brunel), but they already had to take quite a large chunck out of bridges and the box tunnel for electrification",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/fqnj2w/inside_airbus_a310_medevac_luftwaffe_flying/flsmm7g/,bogdoomy,1585445622

An average person certainly had no cause to panic then, but the governments of other countries should have closed off all flights from Hubei immediately and the pandemic could easily have been prevented that way. It's kind of funny now in hindsight that back then everyone scoffed at the suggestion, saying it would be impossible or  absolutely break the economy to cancel all flights from one region in one country for 2 months, while now many countries worldwide are under strict lockdown, completely closed borders, schools closed, nothing open except essential businesses, the police forcibly dispersing groups and ordering people off the streets, etc. And turns out it's totally possible... just very painful socially and economically.

When various industries have been shut down for months (?) they probably don't have a huge amount of money to suddenly make everything ""green"" in the immediate aftermath, they're likely going to be desperate to just get things back up and running.

This sounds so weird... According to https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-012-2627-8/tables/2 Sweden has about 550 ICU beds, yet according to https://www.icuregswe.org/en/data--results/covid-19-in-swedish-intensive-care/ you already have ~250 patients in ICU with lately 30+ more coming in each day. Even if ICUs are completely empty (which they aren't usually) there's less than a week until all beds are filled with COVID-19 patients (who will need to stay there for weeks). Typically ICUs are filled about 80%, I guess Sweden will also have lowered occupancy by not scheduling surgeries etc. in the past few weeks, so let's say only half of ICU beds are filled with existing non-COVID patients. This would mean however that ICUs are already completely full? Even building new beds (and training staff for ICU?) would require quite crazy amounts of effort already to just sustain the current rate of hospitalizations (how many extra beds and field hospitals are being built? Thousands? Tens of thousands?). Is there any source out there that covers these efforts? I tried some newspapers, but they are either paywalled or very light reads and not much data (""we're building extra beds"" - but no mention of how many for example).

For comparison: In Austria 135 people are in ICU for COVID-19 today (https://www.sozialministerium.at/Informationen-zum-Coronavirus/Dashboard/Zahlen-zur-Hospitalisierung), we have about 2500-2600 ICU beds in total and are expanding capacities with field hospitals etc. while being on lockdown for nearly 2 weeks already.

It just sounds so absurd to read stuff from Sweden at the moment, it sounds like y'all are charging head first at the wall with no way of knowing if it is made out of paper or of concrete. I really hope for you that it is the former (since that would also mean that a lot of restrictions could be safely lifted elsewhere), but I wonder how it feels like to live in what is essentially the control group in a global experiment.

The other part that I find a bit weird is that by reaching a far larger infection rate, Sweden risks becoming isolated themselves - imagine other countries managing to sit this out and moving to contact tracing, isolation and testing and then having a plane from Sweden landing somewhere... You might be as welcome as a Westerner in China at the moment.

The last free Slovakian parliament election, before the socialist -communistic- regime was established,  had been won by Democratic party - 62% of votes.

The people did not keep the regime alive because they liked it. There had been an armed state coup supported by USSR.  That's how the regime was actually established.

Those people wanted to reform the regime in 1968, so USSR army with allies invaded the country.  It was a totalitarian regime, Czechoslovakia with the entire eastern had been gifted to USSR by the US as a gift in exchange for the USSR military support against Japanese Empire. Since you do not know history at all, google how other anti regime riots ended up in Poland, Hungary and how many civilians got killed.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this is kinda enough, not gonna comment on your other nonsense since you are shifting the blame only on one generation and don't know much at all. There were several elections where HZDS and SMER were widly supported by entire population regardless of cohorts. When Czechoslovakia dissolved or SMER after Gorila leak, they gained over 80 seats in the parliament out of 150. Corruption always has been a problem in this country and it is because of all the generations of voters keep supporting the same corrupted politicians, voting for ""the lesser evil"" which later evolves and behaves exactly the same the people voted against.

Our problem (I'm Italian) is our politics, every fucking new government since 2011 gives money to people in order to win election, without trying to stimulate growth with lowering tax or lowering burocracy etc. 
Starting with Renzi's 80 ‚Ç¨ to everyone with an income between 20000(circa)‚Ç¨ and 40000(circa)‚Ç¨, those money leed the PD to the greatest victory at the European Parliament election of 2014(if I'm not wrong).

Next one are Di Maio and Salvini (2019) they ruled together with a third-party PM who is Giuseppe Conte. They wasted money with the Quota 100( if the year you worked plus the years you have is 100 you can retire, on average with this system we can retire at the age of 64, but only the heavy workers). In the same year they also added a Basic Income (Reddito di cittadinanza) but it was useless because it should help people without finding new job, especially in South Italy, BUT there is no work! So they are payed to stay at home.

Now we have a new government with Di Maio (even if he now resigned and his party is  about head-less) and PD together with the old PM Giuseppe Conte which is leading in this huge situation that is forcing us to spend ton of money.

Those are approximately our past 6 years. Also don't forget we have Nationalist (Salvini) that are talling a lot of bullshit like ""The Euro was thought to control Italy, they want us to be poor"", staff like that.

Anyway up to now we desperately need help, Italians  don't expect uncondtionate help, we are ready to create something greater with this EU that is able to deal the crisis. But I'm telling you with the heart in my hand (does this way of saying is used in English?), If we don't receive the help we desperately need, we will surely exit the EU.

5563,"That's an old article, there's little evidence for that origin theory. Here's a lengthy but informative [askhistorians thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8lkygx/why_cant_i_find_very_much_information_about_the/dzmw2tn/) about the origins of the black death. A more recent and more plausible origin theory is on the west banks on the Caspian Sea, so right on the border between eastern Europe and western Asia. That was Golden Horde territory at the time. Such a badass name, *Golden Horde*.

&gt;The short answer to your question, though, is that while historians did long assume that the Black Death began its journey in China, the modern consensus is, increasingly, that it did not. The most recent studies, dating to the last dozen or so years, place its original focus somewhere in the region of the west banks of the Caspian Sea, and the majority of those authorities, led by Ole Benedictow, the author of The Black Death 1346-1353: the Complete History, now prefer the idea that the pandemic had its origins in about 1345 in the lands controlled by the Golden Horde.

&gt;While there is no doubt, moreover, that the disease reached and devastated the lands of the Middle East, it's now believed to be very much open to question whether it ever reached what were then the world's two most heavily-populated regions, India and China.

Moreover, the most recent evidence suggests that the bacterium which causes plagues actually originated in Europe.

*‚Äú[It was really unexpected,‚Äù says Nicol√°s Rascovan, a genetics researcher at Aix Marseille Universit√©.](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/12/4900-year-old-case-plague-sweden/577315/) The answer, he and his co-authors suggest in a new study, is that the plague actually originated in Europe. And the bacteria from the woman‚Äôs teeth might be the earliest evidence of a continent-wide epidemic, one that explains a sudden and mysterious collapse in the European population.*

&amp;nbsp;

*[Rasmussen believes the plague may originally have emerged as a human disease in the unprecedented mega-settlements that started to be built about 6,000 years ago in what are now Ukraine, Romania and Moldova.](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/06/earliest-plague-strain-found-in-sweden-holds-clue-to-stone-age-migration-from-east) The settlements were home to tens of thousands.

National identity is listed separately in NI, where 40% classified themselves as British, making up a significant portion of the population, along with those specifying their national identity as Irish[4]).[1][2][3]

&gt;For the 2011 census, in England and Wales, the White British self-classification option included the subcategories of White English, White Welsh, White Scottish and White Northern Irish.[6][7] In Scotland, the White British category was broken down into two different categories: White Scottish and Other White British.[8] In Northern Ireland, the White British classification did not appear, the only choice being 'White'.[9]

The 2011 census for England, Wales and Scotland also included additional White ethnic classifications of White Irish, Irish Traveller and White Other.

So, are each of the 17 autonomous communities self-sufficient in terms of food, medication, petrol, and vital equipment replacements? Can the electrical supply be kept operating with not even essential workers allowed to cross arbitrary political boundaries? And what about other essential workers who live in one autonomous community but work in another, such as Guadalajara-Madrid, or around the Franja de Ponent , or Logro√±o-Basque Country? 

&gt;It doesn't make sense, for an example, that journalists can travel all the country with the excuse of their work.

Personally I think it makes lots of sense that journalists are allowed to travel all across the country with the ***reason*** of their work, and using the term _excuse_ implies a moral judgement‚Äîas if journalists were just choosing to travel for fun as a privilege and, even if they were, as if they could become a significant factor in contagion.

I was pointed out something very interesting: the _New Hanseatic League_, which seems to have been founded without much public attention and is basically a declaration of fiscal intent between Nordic countries ...for now.

When you think about it, Portugal and Spain are supportive of each other during this, and are also on Italy's side, _against_ the Netherlands and Germany, which support each other. The problem isn't that every individual country hates every individual other country, but there are clearly defined cultures in Europe with their own political and financial outlooks, and the farther apart they are, the less they understand each other.

(See also: Belgium, another place where differences were supposed to disappear before the state, but only grew stronger over time.)

I was thinking the EU would disband and then we'd all be left to fend for ourselves for a few years until new trade bonds appear. But if we can buy some time before the dissolution, this sort of structure would appear elsewhere: countries with a shared culture that see the writing on the wall would create mutual alliances that would then peacefully replace the EU.

Those alliances could still trade with each other, but on their own terms, and would fit better in a post-globalism world. They would internally be much stronger than the EU, being made up of countries with common views on things such as immigration and fiscal responsibility.

This is one working model; another is a nation that is small enough to share a common culture and ideology, allowing a strong government to rule with unanimous consent. Singapore is an example; Hungary would be another if Orb√°n wasn't corrupt.

Ultimately, absolute monarchy and nation-states are the natural state of things, and democracy and globalism are anomalies. We may yet return to the Dark Ages of squabbling nations for several hundred years, where any successful empire is built on external conquest and internal oppression.

A mesh of small/medium sized nation-states that cooperate on important matters can _still_ be globally successful, especially in this day and age where population size doesn't matter as much. Singapore is a role model.

&gt;
&gt;""We made a really big mistake,"" Bowen says of that decision. It took about four months to build the new machines, which are as long as a school bus and cost as much as $1 million.
&gt;
&gt;By the time they were ready, the swine flu crisis had ended, demand vaporized, and Prestige Ameritech almost went bankrupt. ""One day ‚Äî and it is literally almost like one day ‚Äî it just quits. The demand is over, the phones stop ringing,"" Bowen says.

To me it seems like rather the same people and countries that have always complaining about lacking integration, are now complaining about lack of action and lack of further integration. While the countries that have always opposed, are now continuing to oppose it. It's not like it is Denmark that complains about lack of solidarity or action from the EU here.

But other things, like the inner working of the eurozone and the single market influences them, yet they can't change it on their own, they can only change that at the EU level.

5998,"CDU/CSU is a party that is all about ""don't rock the boat"" conservatism. No big changes. That's in general much more appealing to people who have already built their livelihood on top of the system as it is, who are usually older, while many younger voters want to see bigger changes

To a certain extent that applies to all societies and is also logical. On a very abstract level, a big change generally means having some initial cost and long term benefits. For young people, the initial cost is worth it because for them, the benefit outweighs the costs. The same isn't true for older people, who don't have as long to live anymore.

But more specific to those parties, the Greens take things like climate change very seriously, which is going to have a huge impact on the lives of the younger generation, and their children. The CDU/CSU tends to try to slow down necessary changes in order not to inconvenience anybody. It's also a matter of culture. CDU/CSU tends to talk exclusively from the position of the baby boomer generation, and what's important to them (like the internet being a scary new place that needs more surveillance), while the Greens also focus on younger generations and their issues. CDU/CSU tend to wear all serious business outfits while the Greens dress way more casually, like normal people.

As for Merkel, she is relatively popular across the board (except with AfD), but first of all she's not running again, and the next CDU leader will likely be quite different from her, and second, she's also a manifestation of that ""don't rock the boat"" conservatism that many young people are fed up with.

Many younger people want major changes towards a CO‚ÇÇ neutral economy and society, they want increased European integration and less focusing on individual national interests, etc. So while people are happy enough with Merkel not fucking things up badly, it's simply not seen as enough, especially by the younger generation.

Last but not least: it's also partly just what people are used to. Especially older people vote CDU/CSU because that's who they have always voted for.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/fq7kwx/germany_poll_in_march_2020/flqppbv/,muehsam,1585402920
