3,"Im sorry, but reading your comment i just cant get past the fact that you lack knowledge on this case specifically. There is a middle road. Georgians arent destroying everything thats from the Soviet era, but theyre also not keeping everything.

There is no reason for the Dutch to keep a badly made statue of Anton Mussert or Seys Inquart; and thats why we didnt (yeah im Dutch too).

Countries are sovereign to begin with, and if they want to remove any statue built by a foreign entity that still claims their sovereignity is invalid, then they have every right to remove unneeded symbolism to that foreign entity.

Georgia doesnt have to and doesnt want to remember the USSR. With that logic Poles should remember nazi soldiers sacrificing their lives for trying to stop the USSR. Thats wrong and fucked, and we dont expect that. However there might be examples of relatively ""good"" wehrmacht soldier trying to rescue a Polish girl from a plundering and raping Russian soldier. Its fine to remember that German soldier, yet no one wants a massive swatstika 50 years later in some neighberhood in Warsaw.

It took 2 weeks for a drunk driver to smash into the display thingy, break the barriers around the ruins and the car ended up inside the ruins

61,"&gt;Geopolitics trumps values most of the time... fact is that Turkey is a fellow NATO member and most EU nations are also part of NATO, as well as the migrant crisis having shown that most EU members are unwilling to take in migrants (that they agreed to take) so accepting Turkey's demands to curb the influx was the only other option.

Judging by the last effort of Turkey to massively send immigrants to Europe that was largely unsuccessful, there certainly were other options. The 2015 wave was foreseeable, so my interpretation is that  there was a silent consent of some countries (mainly Germany) to receive immigrants, otherwise they would have applied the same response as they do today.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Granted as the ECJ shows these EU countries DID violate law by refusing to accept migrants... but this still took years because the wheels of the law are slow and a solution was needed NOW. 

There is not only the matter of refugees, but the problem of the trafficking of many immigrants that apply for asylum for fake reasons.  [Germany has almost 250,000 failed asylum seekers waiting deportation](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-number-of-asylum-seeker-deportations-fell-in-2019/a-51971551). There was no need in the first place for a rushed massive move of people from Turkey to Europe as refugees had already escaped the danger zones, in fact many of them were already in Turkey for a couple of years. A massive move also means inhuman conditions for the people trying to immigrate and that's another reason that makes it unacceptable, while the move could be done through an organized process.

The only reason for the massive move in 2015 was to give the advantage to trafficking mafias, openly backed by Turkey, for succeeding in their business, as it is impossible to properly check millions of people in a matter of months.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So ultimately the reason why the EU bows down to Turkey is because the population wants things to happen that require bowing down to Turkey. The moment the EU enforces on Turkey they WILL intentionally empty their refugee camps and send millions of people to Europe. And that is a humanitarian crisis nobody wants to deal with. 

Europe is doing favors to Turkey, although Turkey had relations with ISIS and recently invaded Syria in many fronts, not only when it comes to immigration.

They look the other way in the games Turkey plays in the Mediterranean, in Libya, in Syria...

There is really no excuse. Even regarding immigration they could easily pressure Turkey to change its stance. Turkey is a country of 80 million people with a GDP of lest than 800 billion USD and the EU a union of 450 million people with a GDP around 20 trillion USD.

*A few days ago, the government made an official announcement that there would be a new census in northern Macedonia. Following the vote on the Albanian language law amid tensions in Macedonia, various Macedonian political forces and the international community have sought to know the truth about how many Albanians actually live in Macedonia. Incumbent Prime Minister Zoran Zaev also spoke at a public hearing on population census. A friend of mine, a professor at the University of Struga, told me that this census in Macedonia would produce Macedonians with ""red shoes"". But a few months ago, Deno Donchev, the secretary general of VMRO-DPMNE, made a bomb statement in front of the Macedonian media about the extreme Macedonian nationalists. population in Macedonia. 

This statement comes at a time when it is being propagated that there are no more than 18% Albanians in Macedonia. when they are over 20% of the population they acquire specific rights. Thus, Macedonian extremists link the non-implementation of the Ohrid Agreement to this fact, they reduce the percentage of the population below 20%. Albanians there.

&gt;

First, the most absurd thing is that if you are not in Macedonia for a year in a row, you do not have the right to register, when it is known according to official state statistics that 1/3 of the Albanians living in Macedonia are in emigration. Second, population census is always conducted in October is not appropriate as all immigrants are abroad and they return in the summer months and registration must be done during the summer and not even continue for 15 days as scheduled but at least 1 month. 

But let's bring some arguments with concrete figures about the argument of the real number of Albanians living in Macedonia. If you go to Veleshta from 1700 houses that the village has, 700 are closed with keys because they are in emigration, in Radusha from 3000 inhabitants 1500 are in emigration, also in the city of Struga, where Albanians are almost 70%, over 35% of Albanians living in the city of Struga are in emigration or in the Polog region that are over 50% of closed houses as they are in emigration But let's take the official statistics of the Macedonian State Office itself. 


During the last year in Macedonia, 22,945 babies were born, of which 57.5% of Albanian mothers, out of the total number of births. Also, referring to the official Macedonian statistics, 19,060 people died in Macedonia last year, of which 14,032 are Macedonians and 3,023 are Albanians, and the rest are Roma and Turkelins. So in Macedonia, Macedonians die more and are born less! Yes, let's continue our analysis with the official statistics of the state entity. 


In Macedonia, in the primary school of a total of all students, over 45% of them are Albanians, and this statistic states that this percentage of Albanian students continues for 30 years in a row. Let's stay within this logic of the official figures of the Macedonian state statistics, it turns out that Albanian children who 30 years ago were between the ages of 7 and 15 are now 40-45 years old, therefore during 2018 in Macedonia there are more than 45 % Albanians.

That doesn't matter, people in his position don't leave holes if they can help it.

I don't think so, at least outside of Hungary.

A lithuanian police force started being formed in 1990. New laws were getting passed, military draft laws of USSR were declared null and actively disregarded by citizens.

Same for Estonia and probably for Latvia though.

&gt;Lithuanian sports comitees refused to participate in USSR sports events.

Could have been here as well, I'm not gonna search it right now.

&gt;After the declaration, there was an economic blocade

Indeed, and that was the main difference. Estonia and Latvia understood that if you restored full independence in this situation, then there are going to be negative consequences. Yet in essence the level of independence was the same for them.

&gt;Like bro, there is a reason why Latvia's and Estonia' independence has (transitional) in 1990 section and (effective) in 1991, but Lithuania doesnt.

Yes, different declarations, but considering it was still a time of Soviet occupation, the real situation on the ground was not different at all.

&gt;Dates of the restoration of independance goes as follows: Lithuania (11-03-1990), Estonia (20-08-1991), Latvia (21-08-1991).

Yet if you look more closely, they often put 1990 date for Latvia as well - point is, the three often have a date assigned based on very different logic and in fact, if you look at dates of independence across the world, then they are also based on very different logic and couldn't fully compared in scientific history, i.e. they only serve a purpose in popular science.

&gt;Hell, we even have documentaries (at least 2 that I've seen, there are possibly more) where members of both the Estonian and Latvian government (both the one at the date of filming and the one when independance came around) talk about Lithuania being the first country to leave USSR.

First one to make a firm declaration indeed, I don't deny that, but the real situation on the ground was not any different there.

&gt;Had a big event for the 30th year anniversary for Baltijos Kelias, a lot of Estonians, Latvians, Belarussians, Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, Georgians had come, none seemed to disagree with that either, neither during the big event, nor when the documentary was shown

Because why would you cause a diplomatic incident like that? Yet this is an anonymous subreddit and we should be able to talk about real history without such worries.

&gt;Also, Latvia and Estonia did not gain independance AFTER the coup. They gained it during it.

It looks like there is no ""identity"" to speak of. Some people like to belong in a group, and feel better for it - that's cool. Speaking the same language is the same as being the same ethnic identity? Most Europeans will disagree with that. What else is there? Religion? There are several religions in Moldova and Romania. Traditions? They drift, and those that don't follow traditions are not the same ethnicity?

I would like to say that ethnicity is like a dildo. A lot of people have one, everyone thinks it's the same, but they're all a different colour and material, and waving it around is kinda dumb. We're all different people. What unites all of us, is that we're people.

Fidesz is [polling around 50% right now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2022_Hungarian_parliamentary_election), and he's likely going to gain popularity from this stunt.

They're currently up slightly from 2018, his opposition is fractured on the left, and Jobbik has collapsed with around 9% to the right.

&gt; Or they shut up and he keeps them.

The plot was pretty clever, because as you say if they react he can say they overreacted, and if they don't, he could keep them.

Since they reacted, it's an easy win for him to give them back. It takes the wind out of the sails of (accurate!) accusations of authoritarianism.

Keep in mind that the value of those vouchers has been increased by 15% of the price of the ticket though. I have no idea whether it's a commercial gesture or a legal obligation, but it also mean that the actual monetary value of the vouchers will be 15% less than the value of the voucher.

&gt;The exterior of the building is dominated by a 100-metre (330 ft) by 150-metre (490 ft) oval-shaped great glass and steel dome ploughed by a roof-like concrete element that rests on the vault.[3] It was constructed on the initiative of then-President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili on the site of a memorial to Soviet soldiers of World War II; the monument was demolished with explosives to free space for the construction in December 2009, accidentally killing two people, a mother and a daughter. The government, during the building's construction, promoted it as a symbol of Georgia's bright, democratic future. Its location in Kutaisi was touted as a boost for the regional economy there as well as a way to knit the country closer together.

Also [here’s](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18367472) an article from the time, rather than the musings of a random internet blogger.

408,"Yeah, Lithuania probably has the greatest claim to being occupied, as they did indeed exist in various shapes as an independent country beforehand. Estonia and Latvia don't share the same circumstances though, so there's no argument there. They were occupied by USSR, of course, but not the Russian Empire.

Even with Lithuania though, I'm just thinking of parallels, if Wales declare independence, were they occupied by the UK all this time? They have their own culture as well, and their own language too. They were incorporated into the UK by force, tried to revolt numerous times etc. Certainly they were a part of UK longer than Lithuania was in Russian Empire, I just wonder where the magic number is.

Another thing is that if a state is incorporated into an Empire, can you really call it an occupation? To me occupation suggests that one state is being controlled by another, but the two never merge into one state. Did Roman Empire occupy Spain for example? Or was Spain simply a part of the Roman Empire for a while?

454,"I agree that all three baltic countries were occupied by USSR. Cannot really comment on Latvia and Estonia being occupied by as I dont really have much knoweledge of those countries from before the Russian Empire. Estonia was a duchy at one point but it was succeeded by the Teutonic Order. Latvia had a similiar thing as far as I know. In any way, they might not have been occupied as their country did not exist yet, but as far as I know they were also opressed.

Wales seems to be content as it is from what I've seen. If it did have a referendum to leave, passed a vote to leave and England refused to led go then I would say that yes, it would be considered occupied. Would not necessarily be considered to be occupied all of this time, because as far as I know there havent been much rebellions as of late. I honestly just do not know enough about Wales. And the magic number varies depending on how fast the cultures assimilate. The difference also being that both Wales and England are anglo-saxon, while Russia is slavic and Lithuania/Latvia are baltic and Estonia is fino-ugric. I think the more differences there are, the bigger that number is going to be. Also depends on how you break people. Russian Empire tried to censor lithuanian as a way to break the people and turn them russian, had it succeeded, Lithuania might have had become just a part of the country.

As for the incorporation, I think once again that it can depend on several factors. Do the people want to be part of it? Are the natives being killed or forced to turn into another culture. Did Spain become part of the Empire due to marital inheritence or military force? How intensly and how long the locals are against your rule.

Grand Duchy of Lithuania for example, by size comparable to an Empire I would say. I would still say that they occupied lands but in a rather lose way. People were allowed to keep their own culture and religion, some of the dukes would just join willingly with their lands because taxes were more favourable. But, some lands were taken by force so it is still occupation in a way. If you win a battle and take land from a duke, but his people dont care, is it still occupation or not?

477,"In 2019, 4.6 million persons aged 15 years or older were employed in the utilities sector in the EU, representing 2.3% of all persons employed.

The utilities sector covers electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (31% of the employment in the sector), waste collection, treatment and disposal activities (22%), telecommunications (19%), retail sale of automotive fuel in specialised store (10%), water collection, treatment and supply (9%), manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products (4%), sewerage (3%), as well as remediation activities and other waste management services (1%), extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas (1%) and support activities for petroleum and natural gas extraction (1%).

 Croatia stood out among the EU Member States in 2019, with 4.8% of the employed persons aged over 15 working in the utilities sector. This sector employed many people also in Bulgaria (3.8% of total employment) and Romania (3.7%), as well as in Greece (3.4%) and Poland (3.2%).

In contrast, only 1.4% of the persons employed in the Netherlands in 2019 worked in the utilities sector, with low shares also recorded in Denmark and Austria (both 1.7%) and in Germany, Finland and Sweden (all 1.8%).

The utilities sector is critical for keeping society going, even in the middle of the coronavirus crisis. It continues to provide hospitals, homes, factories and other buildings with electricity, gas and water; it keeps our sewers running while we are confined in our homes; it makes home office and home school possible; it provides fuel for transport of medical supplies, food and other essential goods during this difficult period.

508,"Russian Empire literally performed occupation with the help of Prussian Empire and Austro-Hungarian Empire by dividing the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and taking it's lands. Lithuania then gained independance in 1918 and was independant until 1940 when it was occupied by USSR. A country, with it's own government, a history, in it's historic lands, that had a military and it's own economy as well as a majority ethnic group that was not the same as the occupier, got invaded and had independance taken away by force. How is that not occupation? And I think the term ""occupy"" works really well as most historians do regard it as occupation.

Just because a country is occupied for a time doesn't mean that it dissapears. If a country is occupied for several hundred years and eventually the culture and population assimilates then sure, it isn't occupation anymore I guess. But when there is a still living culture, a culture that opposes being ruled by a foreign power that took control through military action, how is that not occupation?

And if you are referencing Lithuania as the country who was never independant and thus could not be occupied, I would like to bring up Duchy of Lithuania, Grand Duchy of Lithuania as well as the Kingdom of Lithuania. All three were independant. In actuallity, when Lithuania became independant from the Russian Empire, it was Kingdom of Lithuania for half a year (monarch was not lithuanian and was not crowned as after half a year the country decided to be a Republic). Now, the modern Lithuania was founded in 1918, but it was very much so a continuation of the historic Lithuania. Same ethnic group, same language (language barely changed, a modern person could read a manuscript from those days), same land as the Duchy and Kingdom, same culture.

Edit: Forgot to mention constant revolts and the bloodiest guerilla war in European history, as well as peaceful protests in attempts to attract international aid.

Edit 2: Like, I dont think you seem to understand the context. This wasn't some type of thing where a part of the country decides to gain independance just because, but they still have the same culture and language. Lithuanians had their own language, own culture, own traditions, I mean we're not even Slavs, we're Balts.

&gt; % of Americans that have college degrees is higher than in vast majority of EU nations

Fair enough the US is not doing too bad, but on the long term it is still very bad for quality of life how the new generation has to carry often more than 100K in debt with them which they sometimes are not even able to pay back before their retirement.

695,"&gt; like compound words

English compound nouns work *exactly* like those in other Germanic languages. The spelling rules differ a bit, so English adds more spaces in between, but that doesn't really mean anything in the spoken language.

&gt; it's sentence structure is Latin as well with verb in the middle and not at the end.

I'm pretty sure Latin had a very flexible sentence structure (with verbs frequently going in the end), as had old Germanic.

AFAIK north Germanic languages have an extremely similar word order to English. Other west Germanic languages aren't that different either, with the conjugated verb going second (i.e. ""in the middle"") in main clauses.

And the general sentence structure in English is not the same as in Romance languages. For example, adjectives go before the noun in English, and object pronouns aren't in front of the verb lime they are in French (not sure about other Romance languages).

English is an interesting mix, but the romance influence is usually overstated. Nearly the whole grammar is plain old Germanic (possibly with some Celtic influences), as are all the basic function words. More academic or technical vocabulary is often loaned from Romance languages, and also quite a few everyday words, but that's not really so unusual. Words are loaned across language families all the time.

&gt; ~55% of the vocabulary is Latin.

Only if you count by going through a dictionary. If you go through any text of actual real world English and count the words for each group, you will still end up with probably around 60% to 80% Germanic.

&gt;France

That's pretty dishonest to say this, they had no choice, the powers from the eastern side were planning to attack and moving troops on the border ready to strike, what does France has to do here, giving their face to be punched ?

This war was a war for the Monarchs, their powers and theirs privileges, they saw France as a threat, as theirs subjects would have wanted to do the same in taking inspiration from France and ruling themself becoming Citizens, not subject.

788,"&gt;The survey was conducted online by Kantar between 23 April and 1 May 2020, among 21,804 respondents in 21 EU Member States (not covered: Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Cyprus, Malta and Luxembourg ). The survey was limited to respondents aged between 16 and 64 (16-54 in Bulgaria, Czechia, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia)

So... Its not entirely representative of the union? And why couldnt we get it more per nation seeing as even if a majority  of the total citizens want more EU a low population country like Sweden could still be 100% against it but with these kind of polls we'll never know... Like seriously:

&gt;Around two-thirds of respondents (69%) agree that “the EU should have more competences to deal with crises such as the Coronavirus pandemic”. Less than a quarter of respondents (22%) disagree with this statement. Agreement is highest in Portugal and Ireland, and lowest in Czechia and Sweden.

Who could have known we agree the least... Also this:

&gt;Overall, respondents in Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy and Spain are most likely to have experienced financial problems, while those in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland and Austria are least likely to report problems. Indeed, in the latter countries, more than half of respondents have not experienced any of these financial problems: 66% in Denmark, 57% in the Netherlands, 54% in Finland and 53% in Sweden.

872,"&gt;	The first French establishment is recorded in 1503, but France did not establish a durable presence until colonists founded Cayenne in 1643. Guiana was developed as a slave society, where planters imported Africans as enslaved labourers on large sugar and other plantations in such number as to increase the population.

Sorry, in case of Guiana it was the 1600s.

Nope, no colonialism there. 

&gt;	French Guiana was originally inhabited by indigenous people: Kalina, Arawak, Emerillon, Galibi, Palikur, Wayampi and Wayana. The French attempted to create a colony there in the 18th century in conjunction with its settlement of some Caribbean islands, such as Guadeloupe and Saint-Domingue.

There is no such thing. The three countries were illegally occupied and they were independent since 1918. And the occupation ended in different steps, but Lithuania did not regain independence before Estonia and Latvia.

The government was changed, the press was free and the uprisings happened about the same time in all three.

&gt;Okay, nice, didnt declare independance tho. 

Indeed, as it was seen as being unfeasible, just like it was for Lithuania.

&gt;Didnt start forming a government.

They most definitely did...

&gt;Like dont get me wrong, I have massive respect for both Latvia and Estonia, but what you are saying is just untrue

No, it is not, and your knowledge of history seems rather weak in this issue...

&gt;Edit: also, some soviet (well no longer soviet) troops were in Lithuania until 1993, so by that logic, Lithuania only became independant in 1993.

Assad wants to take control of the whole country, but I don't see Russia as sharing those goals. In fact, it could easily be argued that everything Russia has done in Syria in the last two or more years has just been giving diminishing returns.

Russia protected Assad, secured their foothold in Syria and undid years of US foreign policy regarding the country, and they did it at a time when isolation was the buzzword in the West, when Russia was painted as an unruly but declining power that will simply be sanctioned and ignored into irrelevance. Instead, they positioned themselves as a key player in what was thought as a Western dominated theater.

The intervention also had a slew of other beneficial effects, but this is the main one.

Now, what does handling Assad the control of Idlib or some other shithole gets them exactly? Not much, if anything. This is not something over which they'd seek revenge.

&gt; No, the EU designated quotas are still over fishing. 

They are, but scale is important. the EU overfishes by a small amount, other countries overfish by a much larger amount.

&gt; And you showed no evidence for Russia being the cause.

&gt; Sure and the countries overfishing are EU countries. You are just trying  to lay the blame anywhere else but on the lacklustre EU policies. 

Everybody overfishes, what matters is scale. The EU overfishes only a little is not equally as guilty as a county such as Norway which overfishes significantly.

976,"&gt; It is necessarily correct, because running a car with hydrogen made by electrolysis will always take 3 to 4 times more electricity than using it to charge a battery and run an EV.

The comparison indeed does not include opportunity cost (""what could have been done with the additional electricity used to produce hydrogen?"") but opportunity cost also applies to battery manufacture. For example under a systemic analysis, a good amount of more ""useful"" applications for a 60 kWh battery may be conceivable than to build a steel bullet around it and use it to transport - on average - barely two people a few hours per day.

I, personally, agree that even clean hydrogen is too valuable and rare to be used in cars. However, a lifecycle comparison must exclude hypotheses regarding opportunity cost.

&gt;To distract from this brutal fact a lot of nonsense has to be spewed about EV batteries being made from unicorn blood. This is probably the case for the graph you show, but I can't check that because you posted an image instead of an actual study.

Well most of the members aren't along the Atlantic sea to be able to fish. Also there were all overfishing, none were under. 

&gt;The Baltic countries come out worse because it is also where Russia do a disproportionate amount of their fishing. Because Russia fishes to much from the area, it leaves almost nothing left for the Baltic states without breaching sustainability quotas

From the source you linked it isn't Russia that is the issue, there are more within their stocks than the Baltic states. Also that isn't how the quotas work, the quotas say you can have so many tons that you are allowed to fish. It doesn't say ""oh Russia fished 100 tons so now you can only fish 1 ton"". 

Also according to the source you linked Russia doesn't overfish that much compared to others in comparison to it's stock amounts. Unless you are disregarding a source you linked yourself.

&gt;Russia figure overall is low because of all the arctic seas across its norther border which are underexploited (because it's hard to get to).

So their fishing industry is more sustainable due to others not fishing there as well.

Soaring government debt levels threaten to make investors reassess European sovereign risk and could “reignite pressures” on more vulnerable countries in the region, the European Central Bank has warned.

Eurozone governments’ budget deficits will rise to 8 per cent of gross domestic product on average this year, far above the levels reached after the 2008 financial crisis, the central bank forecast in its annual financial stability review, published on Tuesday.

Aggregate government debt is set to rise from 86 per cent of GDP to above 100 per cent across the 19-country bloc as member states seek to tackle the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis, the ECB said.  “The pandemic represents a medium-term challenge to the sustainability of public finances,” the financial stability review warned.

Public debt is set to approach 200 per cent of GDP in Greece and 160 per cent in Italy, and will hit 130 per cent in Portugal and just below 120 per cent in France and Spain, the ECB said, adding: “The associated increase in public debt levels could also trigger a reassessment of sovereign risk by market participants and reignite pressures on more vulnerable sovereigns.”  **Italy must refinance more than 15 per cent of its debt in the next year, while that figure is more than 10 per cent for France, Spain, Belgium, Finland and Portugal, the ECB said, calling some countries’ repayments in the coming two years “substantial”.**

A decade ago, fashionable economic thinking suggested that beyond 90 per cent of GDP, government debt levels became unsustainable.

Although most economists do not now believe there is such a clear limit, many still think that allowing public debt to build up ever higher would threaten to undermine private-sector spending, creating a drag on growth.

Debt levels are rising across the world as countries turn to the capital markets to finance public-sector responses to the economic impact of coronavirus. The OECD club of rich countries forecasts that its members will take on at least $17tn of extra public debt as a result of the crisis, increasing average financial liabilities from 109 to 137 per cent of GDP.  

The ECB, which is due to update its economic forecasts and review its monetary policy next week, has predicted that the eurozone will suffer its deepest postwar recession this year, with GDP set to contract by between 5 and 12 per cent. 

It warned on Tuesday that a more severe downturn than expected risked putting public finances “on an unsustainable path in already highly indebted countries”, if combined with higher government borrowing costs and borrowers’ defaults resulted in loan guarantees being called in by lenders.

Eurozone governments are set to issue an expected €1.2tn of extra debt this year, although the ECB has positioned itself to soak up a large proportion of that through the €750bn bond-buying plan it launched in March.  Last week’s Franco-German proposal to create a €500bn European recovery fund could provide grants to support countries hit hardest by the pandemic, offering additional financial help.

The ECB said on Tuesday that although countries’ “large fiscal policy response” helps to mitigate the economic cost of the coronavirus crisis and “provid\[es\] a first line of defence against fiscal debt sustainability concerns”, a more severe and protracted economic downturn “could give rise to debt sustainability risks in the medium term”.

The pandemic risked adding further stress to the eurozone’s existing financial vulnerabilities, it added, citing “overvalued asset prices, low bank profitability, high sovereign indebtedness and increased liquidity and credit risks in the non-bank sector”.  Raising the alarm about the so-called doom loop between governments and banks that hold high levels of their domestic public debt, the ECB said this created “risks of negative feedback loops arising from sovereign or bank rating downgrades”.

“Such a development could reactivate the negative feedback loops of the sovereign-bank nexus, especially for Italy and Portugal, as well as for Spain, where bank ratings are closest to non-investment grade,” it said.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/gqyv5v/soaring_debt_risks_fuelling_future_eurozone/frvlm11/,Hematophagian,1590506070

I'm not going to discredit your numbers so long as you don't discredit mine and I'm happy to see these as two valid figues from different perspectives. The point of my argument was more the difference between states. Saying both parties are equally guilt of overfishing is disingenious when one is breaching the limit by several orders of magnitude more than the other.

What source are you referring too, I looked at sources you linked and it is saying similar things about how bad the EU is when it comes to overfishing with independent countries doing a better job than many EU nations under the CFP. 

&gt;I'm not sure what you are looking at to come to that conclusion. Fish stocks have been recovering across the board and you can easily see that by picking almost any species of fish and looking at its population. I mentioned North Sea Cod in another post so I'll link the graph of their recovery in Scottish Seas

The source is from 2017, mine was from 2019, it was after 2017 that that stocks started to decline again as said in the source I linked. Here is another source from 2019 https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/25/uk-supermarket-sales-of-north-sea-cod-may-stop-next-year

&gt;You can see how in the early 1970's it started falling due to overfishing. By the 1980s the new reforms to the CFP slowed the decline and in the early 2000's reformed again which finally allowed the cod to start recovering.

Well they don't and the killer himself didn't, so obviously there was no political objective in which the things he did can be substantiated here it is from the square head himself

&gt;I regret that I hadn't killed any Armenian before this. The army sent me to this training and here I learnt that two Armenians were taking the same course with us. I must say that hatred against Armenians grew inside me. In the beginning we were greeting each other, or rather they said ""hi"" to me but I didn't respond. The reason why I committed the murder was that they passed by and smiled in our face. At that moment I decided to kill them, i.e. to saw their heads off.  
&gt;  
&gt;If not here and now, then I would do the same thing any other time and in any other place. If there were more Armenians here I would like to kill all of them.

Italy as participant of the New Silk Road Initative, has no problems with chinese practices at the moment. On the other hand, are some countries like Germany, France (and the UK), are very worried about the increased influence of China inside the EU and european economic system.

So what is the direction in which the EU is heading now? None. Because decisions have to be unanimous, a single state with a different view can block the whole 26 other states from forming a coherent vision for the EU.

I'm sure it did surprise quite a few people, there certainly seemed to be a sense on the remain side of the argument that people wouldn't be so 'stupid' as to actually vote leave.

It has never been a settled issue. The idea that it was surprising or unlikely that the UK would vote leave would be to ignore a long period of fairly mainstream opposition to the EU on the left and right of UK politics as well ignoring the much broader opposition to further integration and slew of EU projects. Never mind the polling for single issue parties like UKIP and their electoral successes in what people saw as effectively protest elections.

What's the percentage of chinese, american or even japanese cars rolling on Europe's roads? Isn't it surprising EU was able to protect in such a great manner this particular industry while others are fading?

In that context, why? If it is well understood that a large portion of the UK were eurosceptic to one degree or another, that even on the remain side much of the support was practical rather than enthusiastic, and given the issues that were driving that were long term and still existed, why would people be surprised that people then voted to leave?

For example, brain drain have been present in all EU countries, here as well, before integration into the EU, although it happens more often now. But even in those countries that people emigrate to, the best and the brightest still choose to go to US for even more money. Companies moving to tax haven countries is also happening outside the EU, even big companies from the US do that. Here a lot of people also blame the EU for a lot of things, including the wages being kept low. While a lot of investors came here to open manufacturing sites and created jobs, a lot of them also pay minimum wage, which is like 300 euros in hand per month. Even worse when  Italian shoes/cloth companies moved manufacturing here   and those are the worst paid jobs because of also bad conditions, like no breaks during 8h work and more. Either you accept or they tell you, we can find a replacement easily. It's true that some countries benefit a lot more. Here, there is rarely a company that you pay your monthly bills (electricity/water/gas/phone) that isn't from France, Netherlands etc, or have their parent company in one of those countries, or seeing everywhere only French and German supermarkets and so on. Some of it have happened even before the integration into the EU.

\-A technologically illiterate nation.

\-A nation whose demographic is really, really old.

\-A nation in which citizens and even authorities tend to consider laws a suggestion rather than laws, and there's a completely separate set of rules for how things work that is completely opposite to the one for how they should work.  
It's always ""who you know"" and ""do me a solid"" and ""I know a guy"" that gets you any result, even for the basic things, the proper istutionalized channels are beurocratic nightmares purposefully engineered for you not to get what you want despite of vexations. The country is corrupted even at the smallest level, within family businesses and mayoral administration of villages. It's pathetic.

\-A nation that is its replacing youth aged 19-35 with with illegal immigrants. What we're spending in education and training we don't get back as an investment, because there's so little opportunities here and infrastructures are so bad that our brightest minds would rather go somewhere else, where they get paid a decent wager and have better career opportunities. In turn we're filled to the brim with unprepared people from third world countries that are used as ""disposable workforce"".  
In short, we have no future generation that we ourselves groomed that will take the place of the older one when they retire (if that ever happens).

\-A nation with an alarming unemployment rate and a gradually rising number of kids who drop out of school.

\-A nation whose citizens do not trust the government and  often times don't even care enough to vote since they've been let down way too many times (which makes the problem even worse).

Will leaving Europe change any of this? No. Nothing will change all of this.  
What could change is that it's one more precedent that could help dismantle the EU completely, which is something some people may desire because of an ideal more than pragmatic reasons (wanting your country to fully rule itself is not an illogical argument for an idealist, even if it means harder times ahead).

  
My feelings personally?

I don't like the EU as a concept, but at this point it is needed for our youth. It is needed because it allows a platform for abandoning the ship before it sinks. With or without the EU, Italy is in a downwards spiral and will sooner or later end up a fully fledged third world country. With the EU it'll be a bit slower and we'll have time to...""evacuate our assets"" to greener pastures.  
I recognize that there's nothing a honest citizen can do to better things, and they deserve to raise their children in a more honest place, a place with opportunities, a place in which you don't pay taxes on oxygen and yet get sub-par public services, a places where mafia isn't a lifestyle that even non-mafiosi follow and where being a smartass, a trickster, a liar and a cheat aren't virtues or necessary skills. EU lets you re-settle in tens of other countries. That's our way out.

1333,"I'm a bit over 30 and when I was in my teens we used to get wasted at least once a week, often twice. And it was always really, really drunk. 

In my 20s I gradually stopped doing it so often (mostly because I no longer lived near my old friends and people I met at university were generally not quite as heavy drinkers, or they'd be going home or have work or something when someone suggested a bender).

For a while I used to still get drunk about once or twice a month, but as time goes on I seem to have fewer friends who are so available (some have kids and so on), while I also have work and stuff. Sometimes a month or two go by without any heavy drinking and I don't even notice it until the next time I'm getting shitfaced.

As for the really heavy drinking, where you do it until 4 in the morning and then some more the next day, that's once or twice a year for me now.

So that's all changed, but what's changed even more is how the you drink. They don't seem to do it anywhere near as much as we used to. I have younger brothers and I hear from them and their friends that they basically drink about as often as I do now, but they're about 18 or 20 and my drinking peaked at their age, or a bit younger.

1353,"There is, arguably, a significant percentage of the Italian public that misguidedly believes that leaving the EU would solve some of the problem our country faces. This being a free country, they are entitled to that opinion which, nonetheless, is fundamentally wrong. Italy would reap absolutely no benefit from leaving the EU, instead plummeting in an unprecedented financial and social crisis. The EU, in turn, would probably continue to disintegrate from there on, thus vanishing from the global scene and leaving behind a series of relatively small nations with next to no say between China, Russia, and the US (that being the point of the above mentioned foreign meddling).

For many, and not just in Italy, the EU serves as a scapegoat for their economic woes, and, this again being absolutely wrong, any desire to leave the EU based on such reasoning is inherently flawed.

The EU undoubtedly faces some enormous challenges in the months and years to come and I sincerely believe there are a lot of things wrong with it. The only way forward, however, should lead to changes in the functioning of the EU, especially with regard to some aspects, such as monetary policy, whose ""unification"" may have happened to soon compared to the general process of integration.

During the university years I would study in the library, then come out every evening at around 7 and drink a few glasses with other students.

Drinking a bottle of wine at home would have been cheaper, but it was more of a social thing.

Another example regarding another generation: it's quite common for retired men, especially in Northern Italy (apparently in the south they drink less) to spend the afternoons in some tavern. You can always find some drunkard with crippling alcoholism, but most of them drink like 3 glasses of wine in the whole afternoon.

My father actually encouraged me to drink wine since I was in high school, and for the longest time I turned it down lol. Eventually I developed a taste for it, but I usually just drink the occasional one glass per meal, if that.

Never felt the need to drink more than that. Never felt the need to go for something stronger. If I'm eating alone I don't even bother taking the bottle out of the fridge, and If I'm out for beers with my friends I just grab something light to go with my meal and I'm happy with that, often because I'm the driver (I'm a big guy, and I barely register the alcohol in a pint of a 5% beer with a meal).

Honestly I'm curious of the opposite. I hear stories of people getting wasted, especially in Northern Europe and in the US, and I never understood where's the appeal in that. It just sounds like asking for a terrible time, to me.

For example you get sick, you come see me, I say what is wrong, take a patient history, look at how it has effected your body, then we get to the treatment phase, and lets say hypothetically you have a contagious condition.  


  
I don't order you to stay at home at threat of fine or imprisonment.  
I say ""I recommend isolating yourself for X duration, here are these tablets/medication to treat you or ease your suffering, if you are getting worse or no change in X days please get in contact with us"" or something to that effect.  


  


So when you look at that picture yes the message has failed, and that was massively down to the overhandling of it by the media and legal establishment and where people see it exactly as some of us are seeing it- you used threats and law instead of education to try and get the desired response.  
In places like the UK (with a history as colourful as theirs is) how did you think it was going to play out.  


  
Look at this dominic cummings BS  and how hard they are focusing on him instead of the actual medical research and papers coming out about this.  


FYI its not as bad as you think, mortality rate is 4%(national variable) meaning 96% in your favour and of those 4% that do catch it and die 95% of them were over the age of 60, most of you using this are not over 60 so don't try to play that card with me.

Other areas in the south/center of France are in the same situation, but they have been lumped in other regions after the recent administrative rework (in 2015 I think).",,/r/europe/comments/gpruxi/population_of_france_per_region_2020_data_oc/frud4fa/,nautyduck,1590470874

1630,"No problem. Warning, quite a long explanation! 

The idea is that most workers only have time to do their stuff (groceries, going to the barber etc.) after their shift, so generally after 5 pm or on Saturdays. I am saying Saturdays because there are many countries where everything is closed on Sundays. 

Generally these are the times of the day where supermarkets etc are the most crowded and you must wait a long time before you can finally pay. It is even worse in large cities. I find it irritating to see many retired people only go at these hours of the day because they need to ""see people"". It might sound selfish on my part, but the problem is not seeing just a few of them, but so many! They generally are taking all their time, and it is irritating since they have the whole day to do it. You will probably notice something if you go buy your groceries, you rarely see women with young children because at least they go when there are the least people. 

For example, In France, outside Paris at least, shops generally open around 8 am and close at 7-8 pm and almost everything is closed on Sundays. Since people in France generally buy a lot at once, you also need more time for your groceries because you do not want to go every 2 or 3 days. (We generally go to very large supermarkets like Carrefour etc., at least on the country side or if you live in the suburbs of a large town/city. This is also a societal / cultural thing I believe.) 

I do not ""judge"" them all for that, I mean of course they have the right to do it. If they are there, I understand they need something. My point is, if you are not working, not just if you are old, you should go during the day or the morning when there are the least people.

1697,"&gt;You got to be fucking kidding me. Seriously i can't tell if you are serious or not?

Perhaps instead of having your nose tested, you should test your eyes.

&gt;The differences are so minor they can easily be attributed to different different ccensus data.

The whole of Eastern Slavonia being virutally 100 % Serb and the Bosniak population in east Bosnia being significantly diminished. I  guess 'minor' means something different to you. 

Both versions of the maps are saying that the data is from the 1981 census - how the hell can they both be right?

&gt; Also Croatia is 99.99% same it's just that the op map is bigger, but the border layout is near identical.

The size of the maps has nothing to do with erroneous ethnic distribution. The border layout is the same, the ethnic distribution is not.

&gt; Also the ""Serb propaganda"" map shows bosniaks being more numerous than in the map you showed in the middle of Bosnia, while as you said it also shows less bosniaks in east of bosnia but the difference, again is ridiculously small.

So areas which made up RS and the RSK which didn't have majority Serbs before the wars are shown to have more, and those areas outside their control (Central Bosnia in this case) are adjusted to provide more Bosniaks at the expense of Croats (Serb areas remain the same however).

1814,"I think you're just regurgitating opinions without much reading into the matter.

Even if hydrogen did not pose a plethora of issues - such as inherent energy loses of using electricity to create hydrogen, transporting it, then burning it in your car - it would still be an inherently worse form of technology as ICEs will always be less reliable and more costly to maintain due to the sheer multitude of moving parts of which some move rotate while others translate.  


""Graphene"" batteries are still lithium batteries by the way, it's just the electrodes that are made from graphene.   


Also I'm not sure where you pull this hydrogen being less of a fire hazard factoid. It seems especially dubious since EVs are less prone to fire than regular gasoline powered ICEs, it's just the fact that they are under the spotlight which shoves the fire hazard aspect into the spotlight.  


Hydrogen is also a very light element which tends to slowly escape from it's containers over time.  


Think about this as well. Let's say we have hydrogen cars, what would developing it help? Pretty much nothing.   
What would having EVs help? Pretty much everything. All consumer electronics, various management systems, AIs (although these could be adapted to all cars), electric motor technology which is in everything from your electric toothbrush to your CNC machine.

1893,"I was originally assuming this was impossible to answer, but:

If we assume that toddlers are either being removed to remove watches or children from the count, and the ratio was acceptable before, then if it were possible to check which child had a watch, and the priority was to remove clocks, then only one child would be removed, suggesting that either they somehow know only the current number of watches in the shop, and somehow cannot check which one has a watch, or they were trying to correct the number of toddlers instead.

(If they are trying to correct the number of watches but don't know how many watches each has, then we could then imagine some kind of statistical test, where we assume that they remove toddlers randomly until the number of watches reduces, or the number of toddlers reduces until there is only 64)

However, if we assume that their process exactly hits the expected value, and they prioritised removing watches, perhaps because they wanted to remove as few children as possible, then they would be removing 0.2 watches per child, leaving the total result of 8 or less clocks, and 65 or greater children.

But 0.2 watches per child would give far more than 8 clocks, and if it is less than 0.2 per child, then we must either rely on randomness, in which case we need to know the watch distribution to get an idea of how likely it is to remove 1 watch when removing 5 kids, or we must assume that they were removing toddlers instead to reach equilibrium.

Then if we assume again they are removing the minimum number of toddlers, purely operating according to the rule, we can infer that there were 8 watches, shared between 64+5 children, or 0.116 watches per child, which as expected is below the limit given above for the effectiveness of removing watches, and we might assume that this ratio still stays the same after those 5 kids leave, plus or minus some randomness.",,/r/europe/comments/gqe3x8/in_hungary_people_older_than_65_years_cannot_shop/frtg2ax/,eliminating_coasts,1590449598

1918,"There's up and downsides to China emerging as a global superpower really. There's a lot of pragmatism needed. On the one hand, it's inevitable. China and India both are enormously large, the majority of the world's population lives in Asia, and they will catch up with everyone else. They were the worlds largest economies for 1800 of the last 2000 years. 

That said China itself is not willing to lead the world or whatever. They don't really have a political model to export outside of China and maybe their closest neighbours, they don't have the naval power yet to replace the US, and they know that perfectly well. ""the tallest tree experiences the strongest winds"" is a Chinese proverb and if China could they'd happily play number two for a long time. 

So ironically this complete American meltdown we've been seeing is something that's not even good for China. Europe shouldn't overreact either. It's going to be a long time before China has as much influence as the US has, and while Europe should respond in a unified manner when China tries to exert influence, there's also ground for cooperation. 

Africa is an important one.  China has a fairly coherent concept of developing Africa and there's too much cynicism in Europe. At the end of the century, Africa is going to be a continent of 4 billion people, the largest in the world. That has enormous potential or risk for Europe, but it can't be ignored.

1959,"&gt;It needs expensive storage in two distributed places (refueling stations and your car) versus one for battery vehicles,  

I meant that you'd only have to build the storage for hydrogen containers only once, while batteries degrade, therefore would have to replaced every now and then if you want to keep the range.

&gt;plus energy is consumed for the mere act of getting fuel to the station  and then into your car by you (driving to a station) while battery  vehicles can be recharged in exactly the place that you always return  (home). 

It's pretty cool to charge cars at home, but it wouldn't be much different than what is already being done, but if you consider gas station as inconvenient then the whole consept of gasoline powered cars was stupid to begin with. Public transport should be the focus anyways.

&gt; Sounds like an excuse not to innovate. 

With graphene batteries, sure, that's a completely different story, but that's it with lithium-ion batteries. A fully charged car would burn for weeks and a half-full car woudl still burn for days while releasing toxic gases. Considering the amount of fatal car crashes, this could end up worse than it can benefit us.

After 1-2 hours of research however I haven't found anything concrete for this century though. On the contrary it seems the official EU stance has become more and more vague about it.

For example the EU officially sees its goals as merely 'enhancing economic, social and territorial cohesion and solidarity among EU countries' on their own site which isn't exactly precise as to how far this shoud go. It also doesn't seem to be a major factor for joining and the mere exsistence of article 50 kinda contradicts the idea as well.

While I am very much for further integration it does seem like this idea has been washed down quite a bit in the last two decades which is unfortunate. If this is the case the EU is hardly 'designed as an ever closer union' nowadays.

The Germans would not have had the logistics capability in either War to pose any significant threat to the United States. When Germany declared war on the United States in 1941, they were already at war with the USSR. The only reason the United States acted on Germany's declaration of war was to prevent the United Kingdom and France from falling under control, in worst case scenario. 

The Imperial Japanese Navy was the only Force capable of projecting military conflict to the shores of the United States and they acted upon that. That was our justification, not just the barbaric acts they had been committing in mainland China for years prior.

I am not entirely sure what you *think* the study you linked to says, but it merely compares trans people after sex reassignment to a healthy control population - not to people with gender dysphoria who didn't undergo sex reassignment. Had you bothered to actually read it, you would also have noticed that it explicitly says ""no inferences can be drawn as to the effectiveness of sex reassignment as a treatment for transsexualism"", and could have avoided embarassing yourself.

2236,"&gt; yes because a person with a pointed gun to his head will just be like "" yeah, why not I will go to that bridge and let this guy push me off the ledge because it will make it easier for him""

Yes? If you'd prefer instant death with a bullet in your head than even slight chance of survival in water then something is really wrong with your ability to think. Or too many action movies for you, in which an unarmed hero somehow escapes a group of people with guns.

&gt; Sedatives or luring someone to the ledge of a bridge would imply he knew the person

Uh, what? Sedatives can be used by literally anyone following you and surprising you from the back with e.g. some chloroform, making you much less conscious and unable to fight if not unconscious.

&gt; which could easily be checked by checking alibi

Yeah, you definitely know nothing about crime, alibis are checked only for suspects. And they won't come to you saying they were scheduled to meet a dead man... Laptop which could have contained some proof of this plan magically disappeared. They also don't seem to know the exact time of death (water usually makes accurate identification harder), so what do you think alibi would even be?

2328,"&gt; Makes all little sense. It's well known that Bismarck could not stand Catholics, and that he wasn't happy about even Bavaria being part of the club. He was perfectly happy with the North German confederation but had to relent to lobbying by others, including his king. The relation with Germany they had was the absolute best they could hope for, Germany asked nothing of them.

And yet that was indubitably Rudolf's position.

&gt; The opportunity to get even for Königgrätz was in 1870 by allying with France but that was wasted and they were still salty about France carrying the Italian nationalists over the line against Austria barely 10 years before. 

Sure, but Rudolf was 12 then. Though even at the time he felt that it was a wasted opportunity. He even wrote a poem at the time fantasizing about Austro-French revenge on Prussia:

&gt; Möge Götte es uns ertheilen

&gt; Daß Österreichs, Frankreichs Wunden heilen

&gt; Dann treten aus den Gräbern gleich

&gt; Mit entstelten Gesichtern gar sehr bleich

&gt; Die Königgrätzer Werther Sedaner Helden

&gt; Sie fordern ihr Blut, sie fordern Rache ihre entstelten

&gt; Blassen rache süchtigen Gesichter

&gt; Verfolgen ihn den Wilhelm bis vor den Richter

Sure, it's just an excerpt from a bad poem by a 13 yo, but it still more or less represents his position towards Germany throughout most of his life.

&gt; Russia already had free hand in the Balkans

No they didn't. Especially Serbia was way closer to Austria during Rudolf's lifetime, with Milan I, a personal friend of Rudolf, at one point almost offering to give Serbia to the Austrians. Also evident in the Bulgarian crisis starting in 1885, which brought Russia and Austria-Hungary to the brink of war.

&gt; they did not oppose any wars with the Ottomans, there was no alliance or committment to the Sultan

What about the revisions to San Stefano at the Congress of Berlin? Austria Hungary along with the other Great Powers absolutely had a hand in preventing Russian ambitions on the Balkans.

Growth enhancing reforms, I am sure Italy knows what it needs to do, the problem is political will, not ignorance. So with that disclaimer to start with, this is what I would start looking at:

Is Italy the best-scoring country in Europe in terms of doing business or being able to start a business quickly? I bet not. So start there, look at the countries that score highest there and implement the same reforms.

Are there countries (modern western countries) where you need less paperwork or degrees or permits to start particular types of businesses? Then reduce your requirements until they are the same. If a degree of protection is good enough for say Denmark or Sweden, it is probably good enough for you as well.

Are there countries where insolvency procedures go faster? Copy them.

Are there countries (again, modern western countries) that manage to have lower labour market protection? Copy them. Again, if it's good enough for Germany and Denmark, it's probably good enough for Italy as well.

Is your retirement age the highest in EUrope? No? Why not? Your life expectancy is together with Spain the highest, so your retirement age also needs to be the highest. And we're not just talking about statutory retirement age, but effective as well.

Are your taxes on wealth up to par? If not, you probably need to raise them and use the money to lower the taxes on labour. Taxes on wealth, particularly immobile wealth like houses are less of a problem for the economy than taxes on labour. Raising taxes on one and lowering them on the other is not net austerity, it is net neutral in terms of money being taken out of the economy, but it will enhance growth as taxes on wealth reduce growth less than taxes on labour.

Is your tax collection system up to par? There is a lot of tax evasion. Ban cash money to reduce the black economy.

Are there sectors in the economy that are too much protected from competition? Fix that. Protected sectors lead to higher prices, which means being less competitive. Possible sectors often include lawyers, real estate agents, apothecaries and drug stores, accountants, notaries, stuff like that.",,/r/europe/comments/gpsoz3/frugal_four_propose_loans_for_loans_approach_to/frrkbhn/,GrandAdmiralSnackbar,1590412443

You're advocating for an independent Europe, yet here you are wigging out over a u.s. president who indirectly is pushing Europe that way? 


Trump has pretty much been ""America First, fuck the rest"" from the start, which has created quite a bit of distance with many of our European counterparts. His presidency has certainly highlighted the E.U. as a more ""stable"" governing body and drawn distinct policy differences between the United States and the EU. 
 The next coming decade, the United States isn't going to be what it was nor do what it did before. The status quo of defense spending and forgien policies will change, which will leave many of our current allies at an extreme disadvantage if they do not allocate resources themselves. We will stay focused on certain Regional allies, but NATO is dying. 

Whether it's Bernie Sanders, Warren, Trump, or even a AOC... there is a vast difference in politics between Baby Boomers and Millennial Americans, which is going to start reflecting in the governmental policies as Boomers die off. There's a general consensus of a withdrawal from the global stage, but divided on how to do it. It will have to be done in order to fully fund and operate the healthcare network required to support a current population of 320+ million that's growing. 



So what exactly do you want? Strong Europe capable of diplomatically and militarily solving issues that may arise? I think you and I want the same exact thing. 
 You're going to have to get everybody on the same page and pay out a lot more in defense spending to touch the U.S., China, or Russia. That's a hell of a lot easier for a sovereign Nation to do on its own than the current governing EU body, which is why Europe is getting left in the dust when it comes to having military weight to throw around. Without the United States military alliance, Europe would be in a far more vulnerable situation considering. Rven Macron realized that the Europeans are going to have to replace the U.S. forces sooner or later. It's better for European sovereignty/policy and better for Americans defense budget. 


The only argument against United States and Europe distancing is that it would leave Europe vulnerable to military incursions by Russia, China, or other factions in troublesome regions such as the Balkans. Without a US lead QRF, the situation could deteriorate rather quickly.

and lack of alternative I would say. Though mind you I think that the people that vote for these parties also in my country overestimate degree of vilification towards themselves, they often see it where I personally just see criticism.

Then here is the crux, though the positions are valid does not make the ideas any less dumb as presented by the representatives of these parties. Immigration reform is fine until you see Italy has an aging population with a horrible replacement rate and there is no trade off presented i.e. we can restrict migration but to be fiscally sustainable this and that tax needs to be implemented on top of this and this cut etc and this raise in real retirement age, which never happens (savini offered more money to pensioners based on credit) with these parties hence making them populist (or more opportunistically clientelist)

Stepping outside of a union is also valid position, but the subsequent suggestion that this is the panacea that will solve Italy's growth problem because the EU is just an extraction vehicle for an undervalued Germany, is again, not realistic (Spain recovered remarkably well in the last decade). The realistic scenario is, Italy leaves the EU, for fear of inflation private investors move their money abroad, bond holders dump there bonds for fear of default, interest rates rise, the state has to default on euro denominated debt and Italian savers (pensioners) just lose their money, meanwhile all your neighbours/economic partners in Europe are furious. The structural inefficiencies/corruption that make Italy uncompetitive globally will be there and or exacerbated. 

Yet its presented as the solution for everything (they know, Salvini pussied out last time he was in power and did not want to deal with it). Hence my point, valid democratic positions presented in manners detached from reality (or responsibility is probably a better word here as it would be possible).",,/r/europe/comments/gq6pjz/italian_poll_for_next_parliamentary_elections/frrbijk/,spymaster427,1590405016

Even the flights to Germany, Norway and the Baltic States have been restarted.

2719,"https://ourworldindata.org/civil-wars

&gt;One of the most influential studies on civil war is that by Collier and Hoeffler. They argue that the causes for such conflicts are primarily economic and not grievance based. This theory rejects the idea that civil wars are caused by ethnic, religious or other socio-demographic factors. Instead civil wars are the result of rational individualistic assessments of the costs and benefits of conflict as well as the likelihood of success. The economic gains from conflicts are often control of resources and political power.
&gt;
&gt;Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler tested this theory empirically using data from civil wars over the period 1960-99.7
&gt;
&gt;They find that the opportunities model performs much better in predicting the onset of civil war compared with the grievance model, which they find adds little explanatory power. 
&gt;
&gt;Their main findings are summarized below:
&gt;
&gt;* Availability of finance: Primary commodity exports substantially increase the risk of conflict, and the authors interpret this as the effect of opportunities to extort. Diasporas also increase the risk of conflict renewal, which is interpreted to be the result of diaspora financing. This type of financing was a particular feature of the Sri Lankan Civil War where the Tamil Tigers received significant funding from the diaspora population.

Russia does have major primary sector exports.  If the money is in your labor, easier to go elsewhere.  If it's in fish or oil, you have to fight for it.

&gt; * Opportunity cost of rebellion: Measures of opportunity cost such as male secondary education enrollment, per capita income and the growth rate all have significant conflict reduction effects. These variables collectively proxy the foregone earnings if individuals choose to rebel.

This does not fit with Russia well.  Russians [tend to be reasonably educated](https://en.mwikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Index).

&gt; * Military advantage: Population dispersion increases the risk of conflict because it provides the rebels with military advantage.

Russia is large and has a low population density as a whole, but the population is not evenly spread through the country, is [relatively urban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization_by_country).

&gt;* Population size: A large population increases the risk of conflict. The reason for this effect is left open to interpretation and may reflect increased opportunities or grievances.

Not sure how they measure that — what is ""large""?  Still, Russia is a larger country.

&gt;* Grievances: Inequality, political rights, ethnic polarization and religious fractionalization were all insignificant variables in predicting conflict. They find that only ethnic dominance, where one ethnic group is the majority, increases the risk of conflict.

Not sure how they break things up into ethnic group, but I normally see Russia described as pretty multiethnic, so I wouldn't say that likely fits.

&gt;* Time: Time since the last conflict reduces the risk of new conflict, suggesting time can heal the wounds of civil war.

This also doesn't fit — the graph shows the chance falling way off by 40 years, and it's been a century since the last civil war in Russia.

&gt; Fearon and Laitin define insurgency as “a technology of military conflict characterized by small, lightly armed bands practicing guerrilla warfare from rural base areas.” Fearon and Laitin characterize most civil conflicts as the result of weak and corrupt governments fighting insurgencies protected by difficult terrain (mountains, desert, jungle) and a sympathetic population. In many cases, these insurgencies are supported by foreign diasporas or sympathetic groups and the revenues generated from appropriated commodities.

I wouldn't call Russia's terrain especially difficult.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_diaspora

&gt; The number of ethnic Russians living outside the Russian Federation is estimated at roughly between 20 and 30 million people (depending on the notion of ""ethnicity"" used), the majority of them in countries of the Former Soviet Union; about 30 million native speakers of Russian are estimated to live outside the Russian Federation (compared to 147 million living within the Russian Federation).[1]
&gt;
&gt;The largest overseas community is found in the United States, estimated at some 3.1 million people. The next largest communities of Russian speakers outside the former Soviet Union are found in Germany and in Israel, both of unknown size but estimated at around 1.2 million people in Germany and around 1,000,000 in Israel. In addition, in Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, The United Kingdom, New Zealand, Paraguay and Venezuela, several hundred thousand citizens each identify as being of at least partial Russian descent. 

That's not really a huge diaspora (not compared to, say, the more-historically-pugnacious Irish diaspora).

The only factors above that really seem to fit are Russia's reliance on natural resource exports (and if the value there falls off and increases economic hardship, the opportunity present to try to seize control of them also declines) and Russia's size.

2804,"I wouldn't exactly call it a bad treatment, though. The cities were completely destroyed. In Kaliningrad, it is a completely new city, there is almost nothing left outside of few buildings. During post war times, cities had to be rebuilt fast. No one had time and need to rebuild the old towns in brick gothic style, people just put the flats all over the place.

And as the picture of the OP shows, it happened all over Europe, not just in the east.

So while it's tragic that so many cities don't ressemble their form from pre-war, and are often souless because of that, there isn't much anyone can do. Unless something drastic was to be done. I read something about a town in German Pommerania, where they torn down the blocks in the centre and put some historical in thror place.

For most of Poland, there isn't simply enough money to do that, and even if there is, no one will bother to reconstruct anything if there is no documentation of the pre-war building, just to have it ressemble the photo's would be a sacriliege. 

So palaces and some houses are reconstructed, but sadly no one is going to tore down the blocks, at least not now.

Czechs were loyal to Habsburgs and only wanted better representation that would not try to ignore them and Germanize them.

Poles always wanted their own country.

Depends. 

If you have relatively low infection rate with mostly imported cases you don't have to test a lot. We have pretty similar situation here, hard lock down fast, contact tracing and low testing and the whole situation is pretty good. Once we saw what was going in Italy we went for some of the strictest measures in Europe and that's why there was basically no community spread at all. I'll give you an example .... there were two hotspots on two islands, they managed to find patient zero in both hotspot, both islands immediately went into even stricter measures and both outbreaks were contained. The biggest problem and the biggest source of deaths were elderly care home and two got hit hard in different parts of the country.

For each person who tested positive we had something like 100 or more in self-quarantine ordered by epidemiologists who were contact tracing known cases.

At the beginning some people who were supposed to be in self-quarantine went out shopping or to pharmacies .... booom ... you can't enter a pharmacy with ID card and they check if you are on the list and police started to check if people are home.

treated. Any unlawful act or omission by the Detaining Power
causing death or seriously endangering the health of a prisoner of
war in its custody is prohibited, and will be regarded as a serious
breach of the present Convention. [...]

And while classifying them as unlawful combatants is very much possible since ISIS members generally don`t visibly wear insignia, belong to a state's army or associated militia and so on. But I would like to remind you that this exactly how the USA justified the indefinite detention of alleged Al Qaeda members in Black Sites and ultimately Guantanamo under GW Bush. Since they did that the US has paid millions upon millions for the detention (probably billions), struggles to find countries to accept them and can't prosecute them since that would demand giving them a legal status again which in turn would dramatically expose the US government legally for the abuses - from torture to simple things like not giving them lawyers and so on. This means the USA is stuck with them and will pay fortunes for the detention till all remaining detainees eventually have died of old age.

So, no, unless you don`t gives a rat's ass about the rule of law like some Putin or whatnot you are better of treating them as normal civilians subject to criminal law or as captured enemy combatants under the Geneva Convention and equivalent local laws.",Allemagne,/r/europe/comments/gpnukz/over_100_islamic_state_fighters_return_to_germany/frq38uy/,Areljak,1590369109

If it's a european country is a more difficult question.

The western parts of Turkey definitely are a LOT more similar to Europe than the eastern (kurdish) parts are. Kurds without a doubt are not european, neither culturally nor geographically.

But truth be told the only things i really know about turkey are from the turkish immigrants in Austria who are pretty much all Kurds, which is why i'm comfortable saying that they're definitely not european.

Though i do remember last year that we had a Turkish travel group stay at our hotel and they were all from western turkey, as well as one of the bigger cities there.

They were behaving well within the confines of what i would call ""normalcy"" and had i not known that they were turks i wouldn't have guessed that they were either (because as i said my only interactions with Turks have been Kurds).

In your examples the homeowner is paying more than the renter, which isn't true for a lot of places in the Netherlands. Especially if you're renting in the private sector.

3078,"&gt;If anything, it should have taught them that after an initial shock subsided, the industrial production went back to normal.

They knew that. That's why targets were bombed repeatedly. But even if production returned to previous levels (and it often didn't), reducing production for a time was still valuable. For example, the UK calculated the 4 raids on Hamburg in the summer of 1943 cut submarine production by 21 boats. 

&gt;Harris was a stubborn man, and even when his own planners shown him the data, he dismissed it and continued with terror raids until the end of the war.

Harris never believed in morale bombing. He worked purely on the data that showed X number of burnt out acres resulted in Y loss of production. That was the British experience of German bombing and it was the metric Harris used to gauge his success in bombing Germany.

&gt;American approach of targeted logistical and industrial bombing was far more effective however.

I'm confused. The chart you link to shows the effect of the Transportation Plan on rail traffic. The Transportation Plan was created by Solly Zuckerman (an RAF officer and British government adviser) and mostly implemented by Bomber Command (who dropped 46,000 tons on transport targets compared to 13,000 tons by the 8th AF). 

&gt;All the tonnage dropped on the old towns (which had no logistical or industrial value) could be added to this to end war sooner.

All towns had logistic and industrial value. The USSAF bombing instructions made that clear. They specified that no town could be attacked unless it contained military targets, that any town large enough to show up on radar would contain many such targets, and that any town that showed up on radar could be bombed as a result.

The fact that towns were useful to the war effort is why the Luftwaffe, RAF and USAAF all adopted area bombing having started the war with plans for ""precision"" attacks on military targets. The Luftwaffe did so first, the RAF copied them, and from 1943 the USAAF copied the RAF, first with area attacks on Germany, then with a wholesale area campaign against Japan.

The USAAF altered their records to hide their area bombing in Europe, but according the Richard G Davis, the official historian of the USAF, they carried out more than 1 area attack a week on Germany from September 1943 until the end of the war.",,/r/europe/comments/gplt41/the_permanent_scars_of_ww2_in_koln_germany/frpsoy0/,WhiteSatanicMills,1590362686

3095,"Your entire argument is stupid. It's true that it would've happened in the following years had it not happened in 1914. It was still Germany which declared war on both Russia and France, after giving the blank cheque to Austria to attack Serbia(whose proposal for investigation about the murder was fair and judged so by nearly everyone, your beloved Germany included, but not Austria). Austria would've never declared war on Serbia without germany's approval.
The reality you don't want to face is that France did not declare war on Germany, Germany illegally invaded 2 countries to get to France, France had allied itself with Russia to not become germany's satellite, and most importantly that France didn't start any war and commit any genocide in Europe(the same cannot be said for Germany). You can put it however you like, but the truth is Germany wanted war with Russia(seeing how Russia's military growth could undermine german interests in the East), but not with France, let alone Britain(which btw intervened because of germany's lack of care for international treaties they themselves signed, same as Austria with the Triple Alliance in regards to Italy with article 7).
France was scared of Germany(and rightfully so given germany's imperialism, just see what they would've done to France had they won in the septemberprogramm (which was btw respected accordingly in Russia and Romania with Brest-Litovsk 1917 and Bucharest 1918)) that's why it was arming.

&gt; Vad är det för romantik i Nedre Norrmalm? Vasastan? Kungsholmen? Nedre Norrmalms fastighetsbestånd var ju uppruttet, uppsmällt under tider av spekulationshausser av privata byggherrar. De smällde upp hyreskaserner. Jag är ju nästan den ende av alla som diskuterar det här som bott där hela tiden. Min mamma flyttade vart och vartannat år. Stora, omoderna lägenheter med torrklosett och råttor på gården och djävligt och dant. Alltså saneringsmogna lägenheter. Romantiken är för dem som mår bra. Sedan ska fattigt folk bo kvar i uppruttnade bostäder hur länge som helst. De fastighetsbestånd som man har haft där har ju inte haft några estetiska arkitektoniska eller kulturhistoriska värden.

3112,"&gt; Just because something is new and trendy, doesn't make it right. 

No, it does not. Protecting fundamental rights however does make it right. You yourself said that you don't disagree with the Charter, so you should agree that protecting these rights is right.

&gt;But guess what, some values are persistent and survive. Guess what those are. 

Oh, that's interesting! I actually have no idea. I am gonna take a look at what people value at the moment and decide whether those values can be persistent throughout time. First, what Germans value ([survey from November 2016](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/151354/umfrage/meinung-ueber-die-wichtigsten-werte/)):

 1. 59% peace: Well, I suppose it could have been valued in the past (albeit counter examples like the euphoric willingness to go to World War 1). But actually having peace is a very recent development in Europe, thanks to the growing connectivity.

 2. 47% human rights: Also a recent development, and certainly not valued in the past. Also still not valued by some people today, as some people are discriminated by others or even by laws.

 3. 37% democracy: In our modern sense a recent development. The ancient Greek city states did have democracy, yes, but only for selected citizens. They also had slaves, so yeah.

 4. 26% rule of law: Recent development that came with growing state institutions

 5. 26% respect towards human life: Nope.

 6. 26% personal freedom: Part of human rights

 7. 18% tolerance: Even bigger nope than respect towards human life.

 8. 13% solidarity, supporting others: That's a promising one! However, the scope of support did change over time: In ancient times, one might have supported only their family or their tribe. In medieval times they maybe showed solidarity towards their king and thus their kingdom. In the World Wars they might have wanted to support their country. Nowadays, someone from Northern Europe might show solidarity towards Southern Europe. The scope of the support has grown, so I'd say that value has changed over time.

 9. 7% equality: I did mention the discrimination of women already

 10. 7% respect towards other cultures: See tolerance.

 11. 6% self-realisation: See personal freedom

 12. 2% religion: That it is the last place should tell enough about how little it is valued in Germany.

Okay, I am going to search not for German values, but for European ones instead. According to [this Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/25/whyvaluesmatterinawidere) European values include *solidarity* (see above for how it changed over time), *secularism* (recent development), *liberalism* (not a thing in medieval times) and *support of international institutions* (recent development, there are also many Europeans who absolutely do not value those).

What persistent values did you have in mind?

&gt;LGBT trend wave

That's the second time you used ""trend"". There have always been lesbian and gay people, you know? It's just that now their fundamental rights are being protected.

3117,"&gt;That's just bullshit, nobody 'accepts' their crimes. It is simply hard to investigate and get reliable data when people are prosecuted for crimes committed in a war zone far away.

I'm not specifically talking about the ISIS members that have returned to Europe. I'm talking about brutal crimes in general, without excluding ISIS torturers of course: Gang violence, gang rapes, violent rapes, murders of extreme brutality etc. Many extreme crimes are met with relatively short sentences and it's not uncommon for them to get reduced in the future and the perpetrators to earn an early release. On the other hand, the victims and / or their families have to deal with the consequences of the crime till the time of their death. The fact that we know that many lives are permanently damaged and have become a burden because of the conscious actions of the criminals, the fact that we don't impose a life sentence for that kind of harm that was the intention of the perpetrators in the first place, it simply means we are indifferent for the victims and we discriminate against them.

 

&gt;Look, I understand that the way a society deals with criminals may not reflect your personal values and that is entirely normal; it is impossible to conform to each individual persons values and morals.  
That is why we have a constitution and the rule of law to deal with these things; in Germany even the worst among us, even the criminals and murderers have rights and human dignity.  
Treating even the worst people as humans and not going down the easy path of dehumanization is not a sign of fake values, it is how we uphold our values.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is sometimes scary and maybe unsatisfying, but the point of a judicial system is not to satisfy.

I don't suggest to not treat them as humans, even though they have 100% consciously decided to abolish any shred of humanity themselves. I'm not in favor of torture or the death penalty. I'm talking about life imprisonment, which I don't see it as a form of punishment, but as a necessary measure for civil protection.

I also don't expect that there would be any change to the world, because of my values and opinions. I just can't align with a depraved way of justice, that would make me complicit to the suffering of the victims and the total disregard of the value of their lives. I'm declaring my repulsion because I don't want the blood of innocents on my hands, I don't want to be a complicit.

Everyone can have their own opinion. They can even be in favor of any kind of atrocities and certainly some people are happy with the pain of others. I know I can't change any of these and I know that evil is what prevails in this life.

Rather than thinking of houses as a thing that has value, think of them as 25-year commodities we can trade for a while and dispose of, with as many, many people skimming off the top of each stage of the process as possible.  With that objective, retooled our housing industry so that as little money as possible actually goes into the building, and as much money as possible goes into all the other peripheral services involved in acquiring the house.  When I worked for an architect in S. California, we were building homes in the 2-5 million dollar range.

How many drugs are you on to reach this conclusion?

Obviously a lot since someone needs to make sense of these gibberish

&gt;What other arguments are there to disprove my logic? Gender was not a thing before john money. This is not an opinion, this is a historic fact. Before him gender was just a synonym for sex.

That people and their legacy have to be looked at separately.
You are on the complete different wagon for this discussion.
You want to throw the gender studies out of the window... why? Because you are unable to separate it from it's root and declare their findings as unnormal and hence not important. That these studies legitimize people that you deem unnormal doesn't matter to you.
You see them as mistakes that need to be corrected. You are just unable to accept people as what they are or what they want to be. And demand to be taken seriously. I don't take you seriously. I think your stance unnormal. I think you are a mistake that should be correct, so that you comply to society.

Doesn't feel great, does it?

&gt;Actually his views were pretty bog standard for his time.
No even people at that time thought it was over the top.

&gt;Actually no he wasn't. 
Actually, he was. Most of the time. When f Aeschylus, Aeschines and Plato wrote about him. But that doesn't fit your agenda, so you ignore it. How convenient. There is no room for uncertainty or debate or unanswered questions in the world of yours.

&gt; A field with no solid foundation is a shitty field.

Have you ever, in your life, read anything about the history of gender studies?
[The whole premise you build your critique on is just... non existent in the grand scheme of A) things in general and B) its history in particular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_studies).

The wikipedia article doesn't even mention Money. But I guess that's just a liberal conspiracy. Society again tries to make you comply to some norms you don't agree with! Gear up, little renegade and fight for your right to be yourself.

Gosh dang it, your face when some day trans people would do that. But no, they have the dignity to go the legal way.

&gt;If having the wrong number of limbs isn't normal then how come we try to create prosthetics to restore said number of limbs? Prothetic limbs, fingers, ect. One of the biggest goals of both medicine and engineering is cybernetic limbs. Should we just stop development into that?

Are you shitting me??
Progress in one kind of operation that makes you unnormal is good, but progress in another operation that makes unnormal is bad??

Do those paradoxes hurt in your thinky area?

Or is a vagina that is artificial different from a limb that is artificial?
Why though?

If someone has a prosthetic that is not exactly as the limb that it replaces, does it become bad and unnormal in your world? Or because that is cool and everyone is so hyped for that, unnormality is okay for you there?

And ... again... no I am not arguing against prosthetics or changing the human body. You are. Forgot your stand in this debate. Again?

&gt;That superficial norm being... not wanting to hack random limbs off for no reason?

Ey, focus boy, we talk about genitals.
That can be extended to limbs. We talk about changing thew human body.
And, just to remind you, you have sometimes a yes, attitude and sometimes a no attitude. Yes, when it comes to limbs, but no when it comes to genitals. That doesn't stop you though from treating both as equally bad when changed... no wait... for you a changed genital, equals a lost limb.
But a changed limb is something good all of the sudden.... god! MAKE SENSE ALREADY!

&gt; Cool, can you point me to a book that instructs liposuction for anorexics?

Again that bad faith argument. Sorry I cannot keep up with the things you equate to one another, but than in the next sentence don't equate to one another anymore. Then come with a totally unrelated problem, discussed and dismissed days ago Just to throw it in there unneccessarily again... without sense, without context, without explaination. Just statement after regressive statement. Just mimimimmi the world changes and people change but I don wanna. Grow dafuq up.

&gt;Don't worry about that, I'm gonna make sure to not let my kids access fetish websites that might get weird ideas into their heads.

So obvious. So wrong. You WILL have a trans child with that attitude. And I would like to see you then and laugh at you. And protect the child from your abusive, close minded terror regime you call family.

&gt;I really hope your son isn't a transexual though. You're just gonna give him every single mutilative butcherjob you can think of, destroy his body, drug him up for no reason and push him into an early grave.

You knmow there is the biggest difference between us.
I dont shove my child any agenda down their throat. I want them to be what they want to be. I don't do nothing to my children except give them compassion and understanding for what they are. Even if they end p a regressive naked pseudo monkey that think porn makes you trans. That is okay with me, because I want people to be how they want to be. Not how I like them to be.

3290,"&gt; Why most people prefer to rent in Switzerland and Germany?

It’s not a matter of preference but of economics. If you could
purchase on the same terms as rent, I doubt many would choose
to rent. In most places where the jobs actually are, communal
administrations have been reluctant in granting building permits
(to put it mildly) for decades and now we pay the price. Tightened
regulations on construction standards certainly didn’t help. From
a coarser vantage point we’re dealing with another generational
conflict: older people own, and have nothing to gain from
improved regulations or subsidies of construction projects. There
are far fewer younger people (below 50 years I suppose) so the
matter is unlikely to be resolved through the democratic process.

Just to give an example, in Heidelberg where I used to live the
number of expensive cars is rather high because at least that’s
a status symbol many live to attain. The owners would still be

&gt;- If you don’t think the destruction of our pacific navy fleet didn’t cause us to declare war on japan. Then that’s your opinion. It happened within hours of the attack. 

Why do you keep making things up? I never said that. 

Can you read? 

An act of war, like pearl harbour, is different from a war, like the American civil war. 

It was a single attack/battle. 

If Japan attacked pearl harbour and then proceeded to invade the west coast rather than fight in the Pacific, that would be a war fought in he US. 

But pearl harbour wasn't a war, it was an attack. 




&gt;- 9/11 - What was the provoking of Al Qaida? It was because we supported Israel. That’s it. Not a reason IMO to kill 2,500 civilians.

I obviously don't think the victims of 9/11 deserved to die, but given Israel are responsible for far more than 2500 civilian Palestinian deaths, I can understand why a group of Muslims would see support of Israel as provocation. 


&gt;Here’s what Osama Bin Laden said in 12.2001
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;“It has become clear that the West in general and America in particular have an unspeakable hatred for Islam. ... It is the hatred of crusaders. “**Terrorism against America deserves to be praised because it was a response to injustice, aimed at forcing America to stop its support for Israel,” which kills our people**. ... We say that the end of the United States is imminent, whether Bin Laden or his followers are alive or dead, for the awakening of the Muslim umma (nation) has occurred”
&gt;
&gt;Shortly before the U.S. presidential election in 2004, bin Laden used a taped statement to publicly acknowledge al-Qaeda's involvement in the attacks on the United States. He admitted his direct link to the attacks and said they were carried out because:
&gt;
&gt;“we are free ... and want to regain freedom for our nation. As you undermine our security, we undermine yours.”
&gt;
&gt;Source: Wikipedia. 
&gt;
&gt;We did nothing to Al Qaida. We even had Muslims living happily across the states for decades. (Many stupid Americans didn’t even know about the Israel / Islam conflict much less have hatred for Islam, until RADICAL Islam brought terrorism to our shores)

You can't be that ignorant about the situation between Israel and Palestine?

There's a lot of bad blood in the middle east, to some Muslims supporting Israel is the same as supporting the murder of innocent Muslims.

Bin Laden literally said that in that quote of yours. I put it in bold for you.",,/r/europe/comments/gplt41/the_permanent_scars_of_ww2_in_koln_germany/frojnj4/,charlie2158,1590340118

And you've been treating superficial appearance as something unimportant throughout this discussion.

Now you're trying to turn it around as if you *do* care about the superficial appearance somehow.

&gt;I don’t like that style either, I think it’s ugly and lazy. Stop assuming I’m defending terrible modern designs: modernism isn’t all about giant boxes.

So stop defending rectangular boxes, maybe? I obviously was referring to rectangular boxes or similar garbage designs in my original comment, and was obviously criticising the rectangular boxes shown in OP's picture.

Still, the problem is that the *vast majority* of modern architects design rectangular boxes that don't have much focus put into livability either.

&gt;Probably because only the masterpieces from the 17th and 18th century remain and you’ve spent too much time in dumpy buildings from the 60s and 70s rather than really nice ones that incorporate cutting-edge designs. One can play the anecdote game until the end of time, though.

The really nice, cutting edge designs still lose out to the masterpieces of the 17th and 18th century, in my opinon. So again, why not build and improve on those masterpiece design instead of trying to reinvent the wheel and design jarring buildings that don't fit with the cityscape.

&gt;I don’t like that style either, I think it’s ugly and lazy. Stop assuming I’m defending terrible modern designs: modernism isn’t all about giant boxes.

Which, again, makes me very confused as to why you jumped on my comment criticising modern architects who *do* design rectangular boxes.

&gt;No. Rectangular boxes are generally a consequence of lazy modernist designs.

Yay, we agree on something! I refer to my previous confusion as to why you jumped on my comment regarding rectangular boxes.

     

&gt;No. Rectangular boxes are generally a consequence of lazy modernist designs. Taping a banana to the wall is post-modern, and post-modern architecture is very different from the squares.

I honestly don't give a fuck if it's modern or post-modern design. Even the examples posted of modern or post-modern designs don't appeal to me, and look off in current, European cityscapes.

3396,"Of course the cradle of civilization exists there, but if you’re really arguing the modern Iraqi state represents any kind of cohesive, civilized state, you’re insane.  That part of the world has been so smashed into the ground in the modern era, and its borders literally invite instability and violence because they were drawn by a European colonial power too broke to continue administering it. It’s a tragedy - I’m not saying it in a ‘Iraq sucks brown people are dumb’ ignorant sense.  But it can’t be argued that Iraq today is not a member of the civilized world.  It’s state is flat-out untenable, and its population outside of major metro centers is only vaguely familiar of what becoming a western-style state would become.

I made it abundantly clear in my post that I wasn’t trying to demean the Iraqi people, and I continue to further that what we in the west would consider a civilized and centralized state not only hasn’t existed in Iraq for centuries, but also isn’t able to exist in the current conditions of the country.

I enjoy the discussion, but perhaps the medium isn’t conveying my nuance.  If you want to discuss further, I would appreciate not telling my to go fuck myself when I’m making a point that most foreign policy professionals around the world would agree with.  If you want to get into what makes a country uncivilized and unstable, I would be more than happy to put you in contact with Iraqi expats living in America who would absolutely agree with my assessment.

I want to reinforce, I in no way stated that Iraqi people are uncivilized brutes, only that their state, government and greater society are bluntly not.  I’ve met my share of Iraqi expats who love their home but agree with that assessment of why removing Saddam only made the country more unstable and dangerous.  The only way to hold a place like that together, most would argue, is with an iron fist a la saddam.

3414,"People have been complaining about “modern architecture” for centuries.

The thing is, there is a constant push and pull between “form” and “function” in home architecture that is heavily influenced by both the latest developments in technology, the state of available land, and what “the market” is asking for.  Oh, also, cost.

The trick with making old architectural styles modern is a lot of what we’ve learned about home construction (materials availability, energy efficiency, heating/cooling, foundational stability, etc) can make some older architectural styles...ugly.

One of the biggest differences just in the last 50 years has been the concept of the “sealed envelope.”  

Beforehand, homes were built to “breathe” because heating/cooling technologies were mich more primitive, and energy scarcity wasn’t as big of a problem. Cooling, if it was accomplished at all, often consisted of a swamp cooler or cupelo to move air through the home, and real fancy places used deeply-inset windows to ward off the sun.  The movement of air from outside to inside back outside was critical.

But now, we have central air conditioning, forced air ducts throughout the home, and heating/cooling bills!  Now we seal up the home with an effective “envelope” (various solid and liquid materials/barriers to keep all outside air/moisture outside and visa versa) so that all that expensive hot/cold air you just paid for stays where you want it. 

However, the result of that is making some of the masonry/stucco/other historic/fancy exterior facades entirely decorative, non-functional, and sometimes resulting in a bit of a mess that “just doesn’t look right.”  

Another issue is a lot of the decorative filigree that comes with certain architectural styles that MUST be hand-done causes a much more noticeable increase in cost when so much of home construction today is mechanized and achievable most less-costly. Roof trusses, drywall, floorboard, bath/kitchen cabinetry, etc are all made at giant factories for a fraction of what it used to cost to fashion on-site. Painting is often done by spray gun. Concrete is delivered on cement trucks and bricks are almost never used structurally anymore.

So when you have to stop the bulk work to add a fancy, carved column to a front porch, or a complex crown mounding to a ceiling, or a detailed, colorful paint job to an exterior, the cost of doing that compared to the quick, mechanized work is significantly more than in days past when it didn’t add “that much work.”",,/r/europe/comments/gplt41/the_permanent_scars_of_ww2_in_koln_germany/fro4ylk/,WisconsinHoosierZwei,1590333112

-

The next sentence:

&gt; If the victim's injuries are minor, such as bruises or scratches, and the perpetrator has no prior record, then the perpetrator will likely be charged with a misdemeanor, under California Penal Code, Sec. 243(e)(1)


---

&gt; And even IF it's a misdemeanor, they're more likely to spend a month in jail then get away with a simple fine.

Citation needed.

Regardless, the law is pretty much the same here.

The main cause of the US entry was the Zimmerman telegram, wherein the Germans sent a telegram to their embassy in Mexico saying to the effect of ""we will offer the Mexicans a treaty wherein we will assist Mexico in retaking the lost territories of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona with financial aid and equipment, if Mexico agrees to attack those territories to prevent a US entry into the war. You may also put this treaty to Japan to see if they want to join and possibly take California.""

The stupid thing was that at the start of the war the UK had cut all of the direct transatlantic cables from Germany to the US, so the Germans enciphered this telegram and sent it via a neutral nation (as is allowed in diplomatic law). Britain was reading traffic on all of the telegraph cables which were left, because they all ran through the UK. Britain decoded the telegram and passed it on to the US and basically said ""look what they're planning to do!"". 

Then Zimmerman, the German foreign minister, in a press conference was asked basically ""the British must have forged that telegram, right, you'd not be stupid enough to do that, surely?"" And he said ""No, it's real, I sent it"".

3447,"&gt; This methodology isn't useful due to weekly variance. You have to take a longer range and an average from that range. 

You could calculate the sum of z-scores of multiple weeks like is done [here](https://twitter.com/MartinJordo/status/1263610854899154945). The results are pretty much the same though:

1. England 218.63
2. Spain 131.01
3. Belgium 124.44
4. Italy 95.26
5. Scotland 84.79
6. Sweden 75.01
7. France 66.44
8. Netherlands 40.06

You can see that the highest weekly score is a pretty good indication of the excess mortality over a longer period.

&gt;That would get you numbers closer to reality, which in some of these countries is that there is no excess mortality at all

This graph shows that reality just as clearly. In countries with a score lower than 2 there was no excess mortality. 

&gt;Mortality is actually lower than usual as the lockdown reduces other causes of death more than the pandemic has caused deaths.

This was certainly not true a couple of weeks ago. There could be less mortality than normal now, which is usual after an epidemic, but for most countries the data for last week isn't available yet.",,/r/europe/comments/gp6mwa/it_is_now_finally_possible_to_reliably_compare/fro5pwd/,StudentjeNL,1590333443

There must also be the 'will to war'. Potentially America has always had the greatest war-capacity in the world, but her President's famous declaration in 1915 that she was too proud to fight only brought her the contempt of other nations. America was in no danger from Germany; could never be in danger from Germany; and if she joined the Allies, she was certain of joining the winning side. Consequently her prestige demanded that she should join the winning side. An individual may be too proud to fight; too proud to reply to insult from one to whom he holds himself superior.

3596,"I don't think any German city rebuilt the old buildings the way they were if they had been completely destroyed, with the exception of (some) landmark buildings. Dresden center may look like a bit of an exception, but most of those are really just new buildings with a facade that blends well into the old style, so that the center as a whole - old and new - looks consistent. Step just slightly outside the center and you get the full charme of Russian brutalist architecture. Although many of the ""Gründerzeit"" buildings around the turn of the 20th century remain. Sort of characteristic ""cubes"", but nice to look at.

Old architecture and city planning places a lot of restrictions, so it makes sense to use the ""chance"" a complete destruction offers to redesign everything. And it also makes sense to prioritize living space over aesthetics when your population is starving and without housing. It may look tragic today, but it was the right decision to make.

Frankfurt has several spots of basically untouched ""old town"" that escaped destruction. You're probably thinking of Frankfurt because of the skyscraper downtown? That didn't happen until long after the war though, and the reason is simply that Frankfurt was and is quite densely populated, so space was always scarce. They decided that the amount of green space in the city had to be preserved and expanding outwards wasn't really possible since the entire area is densely populated. So... up was the only way to go. Once the first skyscraper stood it was much easier to build more. In other cities there is strong opposition from the populace due to how drastically skyscrapers change the area in many ways.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/gplt41/the_permanent_scars_of_ww2_in_koln_germany/frnsw5j/,banana_liver,1590326483

3601,"- [Policeman sneezing on a man wearing a Yellow vest](https://twitter.com/CollectifOEIL/status/1263489257332781057).

- Interior Minister Christophe Castaner tweeted to condemn the anti-police violence words of a singer.

Yesterday night this young singer and actress, Camelia Jordana, was on a show (which used to be very popular but has been steadily plunging, meaning not many people probably even watched) and the topic of police violence was brought up. She simply stated the truth, some citizens are being targeted and sometimes killed by the police because of the color of their skin, on top of protesters losing an eye, etc. The interior minister tweeted to claim it is false and to support a police union which filed a complaint againt her. 

- President Emmanuel Macron made several phone calls during this pandemic: 

-To his friend Philippe de Villiers, far-right politician, whom he authorized to reopen his regional park ""Puy du Fou"", which is a huge touristic place that on the surface is a family-friendly attraction made possible by an army of volunteers and is actually a political tool used by de Villiers, far-right, homophobic, anti-abortion, racist guy. Whom Macron likes and considers a friend.


Meanwhile, in big cities and notably in Paris, Parks and gardens are still closed, which means people who live in &lt;20m2 and have been respecting the lockdown for 3 months are now being treated like naughty children by politicians and pundits on the news channels (who speaks as if they were cops) because they dare to sit near the Seine or on the available grass patches they can find. (After spending time commuting in crowded subways to go to work and save the economy).


-To 'redneck"" comedian Jean-Marie Bigard, whom he reassured about the opening of bars. Bigard is  (or was, his career is far behind him) a 'comedian' who used to be quite huge, famous for his misogynistic and vulgar skits. And who recently turned towards politics, in a populist ""we can't say what wa want to say anymore!"" type of way. 

-(Macron has also recently called xenophobic, homophobic, islamophobic, misogynistic pundit -condemned for racial hatred- Eric Zemmour. As well as populist dangerous virologist Eric Raoult - ie the one who is responsible for the interntional hydroxychloroquine craze). 

- There have been suspicious moderations of anti-homophobia, anti-sexism and anti-racism on French twitter this week. 

This comes right after the passing of a law last week presented as a tool to combat online hatred, which was presented by a LREM MP who was accused by her former assistants of work harrassment, sexism, homophobia, racism. But I'm not sure this apparent wave of zealous and suscicious moderation spree by French twitter is actually linked to the passing of this law.",,/r/europe/comments/gpmler/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20200524/frn9sa3/,DidierLallement,1590318482

3659,"&gt;Rotterdam was punitive and destroyed for no other reason than to make the Netherlands submit.

Now I absolutely agree with you, but that very same argument can be made about quite a few of the American bombings. 

Germany did deserve everything they got and nothing they got compared even a little bit to the atrocities we commited, and one atrocity by the allies should NEVER be an excuse for way bigger atrocities on the axis side, however for the future, only because one side does commit incredible atrocities, shouldn't mean the other side suddenly gets a hall pass to loosen their own morals. You can't claim to be the good guys, and then ignore the crimes done on your side.

And I am not refering to WW2. But that good guys vibe has been carried over after WW2, and you can't be the good guys and bomb Laos, which you aren't at war with. You can't kill civilians in Vietnam. You can't topple democratically elected regimes in Iran. You can't let murderers in your own ranks during Iraque and Afghanistan off the hook scotts-free. 

Saddam Hussein was way worse than the Americans, but how can you claim to be the good guys, and fabricate a war? To not charge soldiers, who clearly comitted war crimes?",,/r/europe/comments/gplt41/the_permanent_scars_of_ww2_in_koln_germany/frnam3z/,I_haet_typos,1590318994

Sexual orientation doesn't (like gay or lesbian or bi), but being trans is linked to a heavy increase in rates of substance abuse and suicide. And before you start saying that's because of oppression - I'm pretty sure Jews were oppressed more in Nazi Germany but their suicide rates weren't even close. PoWs in internment camps, Japanese in US camps, whatever. More recent examples: gays in countries that don't accept homosexuality (like Russia and the entirety of Eastern Block) also do not experience abnormally high suicide rates trans people do - and this rate keeps climbing as the most-known figure of 41% has become 50% in the recent years.

3772,"&gt; Did you even read your own articles thoroughly?

I sure did.

&gt; In 1966, a botched circumcision left eight-month-old Reimer without a penis. Money persuaded the baby's parents that sex reassignment surgery would be in Reimer's best interest. At the age of 22 months, Reimer underwent an orchiectomy, in which his testicles were surgically removed. He was reassigned to be raised as female and given the name Brenda. Money further recommended hormone treatment, to which the parents agreed. Money then recommended a surgical procedure to create an artificial vagina, which the parents refused. Money published a number of papers reporting the reassignment as successful.

&gt;During subsequent appointments with Reimer and Reimer's twin brother Brian, Money forced the two to rehearse sexual acts, with David playing the bottom role as his brother ""[pressed] his crotch against"" David's buttocks. Money also forced the two children to strip for ""genital inspections"", occasionally taking photos. Money justified these acts by claiming that ""childhood 'sexual rehearsal play'"" was important for a ""healthy adult gender identity"".

&gt;Reimer said that Money forced the twins to rehearse sexual acts involving ""thrusting movements"", with David playing the bottom role. Reimer said that, as a child, he had to get ""down on all fours"" with his brother, Brian Reimer, ""up behind his butt"" with ""his crotch against"" his ""buttocks"". Reimer said that Money forced David, in another sexual position, to have his ""legs spread"" with Brian on top. Reimer said that Money also forced the children to take their ""clothes off"" and engage in ""genital inspections"". On ""at least one occasion"", Reimer said that Money took a photograph of the two children doing these activities. Money's rationale for these various treatments was his belief that ""childhood 'sexual rehearsal play'"" was important for a ""healthy adult gender identity"".[16][page needed] Estrogen was given to David during adolescence, inducing breast development.[26]

And this is the foundation of ""gender theory"". This is what ""current science"" is based on.

Its role is even more important when it comes to executive orders because, while in the US the President alone is responsible for executive orders, in Germany the individual minister has to consult the Federal Council when it comes to regulations on the basis of laws that are executed at the state level.


This makes no sense. The US senate has complete control over what federal law is because it has to vote on all federal law. The Bundesrat can’t block all German federal law. Not only can the senate block all US federal law, but it can amend draft bills, and draft its own bills, and it appoints all judges and officers, and the senate ratifies all treated.",,/r/europe/comments/gon5aj/the_composition_of_germanys_second_chamber/frml3yf/,JSanchez504,1590304524

My understanding is the US National Guard are state based forces that are under the joint control of the federal government and the guard's state. They act as reserves for the federal military, and, as of 2007, are able to be mobilized by the president without state consent. 

Their active role tends to be domestic, under the control of State governors. Recently, for example, my state's Governor deployed our National Guard to enforce quarantine and provide emergency services.

Outside of the national guard, a number of states also have their own military that the feds have no control over.

3957,"ISTANBUL — Every weekend, for over a month now, Istanbul has been under a strict curfew because of the coronavirus. No one is allowed out, not for exercise or groceries, and the police impose fines. Sometimes, like last weekend and next, the street-emptying lockdown stretches for four days to take in public holidays.

That has dampened one of the great joys of living in Istanbul: watching the perpetual commotion of this water-bound city, where the Bosporus and the Golden Horn open onto the Sea of Marmara.

From many vantage points, you can see the tiny fishing boats bobbing and glinting, the passenger ferries crisscrossing incessantly, and the giant container ships and long oil tankers that glide right through everything.

But the curfew has offered new moments of breathtaking beauty.

A reverent hush falls over the city. The timeless skyline of mosques and minarets seems to grow in stature in the silence. The sapphire waters are as still as a pond.

Nature lovers have been thrilled. Dolphins have ventured closer, even dipping and diving by the Galata bridge that crosses the Golden Horn. Migratory birds are bolder, storks have returned to an old haunt, and the pollution has lifted, giving the city its first glimpse in 20 years of the snow-covered mass of Mount Uludag, 100 miles to the south.

The clanging of the construction sites and the thick hubbub of traffic has eased. The only movement is of the sea gulls wheeling over the roof tops. I can even hear a cock crowing in someone’s garden.

Of course, Istanbul’s curfew could never be a total shutdown. Its residents have lived through multiple military coups, sieges, earthquakes, pestilence and other calamities, and know well that life must go on.

So bakers are exempt from the curfew because fresh bread is so important for the Turkish table. They shout their wares on the empty street and sell bread from the back of their vans.

When Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting, began last month, pastry shops also got an exemption. Turks it seems cannot do without their baklava, that heavenly, multilayered, flaky pastry, bound up with nuts and syrup, that is the nation’s favorite sweet.

Journalists were allowed out too, so I went to visit Karakoy Gulluoglu, the most famous house of baklava, down near a ferry dock.

Murat Gullu, the general manager, whose great-grandfather founded the company in the 19th century, said he asked the government to allow baklava makers to stay open.

“We eat baklava on all occasions,” he said, “especially in Ramadan, at celebrations, and at funerals.”

We slide past that sad thought. Over 4,000 people have died in Turkey from the coronavirus and 150,000 have been infected.

Mr. Gullu’s master pastry chefs are working throughout the lockdown, hand-rolling sheets of pastry until, as tradition demands, each one is so fine you can read the newspaper through it.

The chefs bake thousands of trays, drench them in syrup and box them up for hand delivery to customers’ homes.

Ramadan drummers are also allowed out during curfew and prowl the streets at night, banging a warning to people to get up and eat before the dawn call to prayer begins the day’s fast. The drummers are an old tradition that refuses to die even if the more secular neighborhoods have asked them not to disturb their sleep.

With some pleasure and pride, Turks are rediscovering their old traditions — like the one where a householder will lower a basket from a window and shout to a shopkeeper to place an order in the basket to save the trek down flights of stairs.

In my neighborhood of Beyoglu, with its narrow townhouses and overhanging windows, you see that more often these days. There are baskets outside grocery stores too, or just on the street, where people place an extra item for anyone in need to take.

Betul Ozkan in Fatih, one of the oldest neighborhoods, posted a photo of her family’s basket, with a line from the poet Rumi: “There is much hope after despair and many suns after darkness.”

Another custom is for people to pay for two loaves of bread at the bakery, leaving one for the baker to give to someone more needy. Opposition mayors, thwarted by the central government from direct fund-raising, have run hugely successful campaigns in the last couple of weeks asking people to pick up the tab for those struggling to pay their utility bills.

For all its glories of culture and architecture, Istanbul — the longest lived-in political entity in Europe — has long been known for its festering diseases. The Sultan’s Topkapi palace and much of the city has notoriously been rife in the past with cholera and tuberculosis.

The immense hulk of the Byzantine cathedral, Hagia Sophia, was just built in time to witness the great plague of 542 A.D., which devastated the city.

Twenty percent of the population died during repeated outbreaks, including the chief aide to the ruling emperor Justinian. Mass graves were dug in the Galata neighborhood across the Golden Horn, and corpses were piled on ships and pushed out to sea.

Maybe such experiences with disease have led to an abiding obsession with cleanliness in Turkey. Workers and guests take their shoes off before entering your home. Restaurants have always offered cologne for your hands even before the days of Covid-19.

On many a street corner there are carved marble Ottoman-era fountains, although sadly few have running water anymore. These days, hygiene officials in colored T-shirts stand on the main shopping street with plastic bottles of antiseptic gel on a table.

When the weekend curfew ends, people burst out their doors with relief, some even ducking out to the corner shop on the stroke of midnight.

The lifeblood of the city, the small stores and businesses, remain mostly closed. Restaurants offer takeout only, with the cafes, bars and tea shops still barred from opening.

But as the weather turns warm, the city is yearning to sit outside again.

Shopkeepers have started spring cleaning, in anticipation of a return of commercial life. The antique shops have begun placing furniture back out on the sidewalk. A furniture shop has placed brochures on the windowsill. Maybe business will move outside.

No sign of any customers yet though.

Small businesses have been struggling already for some years, rocked by a series of economic hits — the violent breakup of the Taksim square protests in 2013, the terrorist attacks in 2016, which scared away the foreign tourists, then a failed coup and a currency crash.

The artisans — potters, woodcarvers and goldsmiths — who work out of tiny studio workshops in the steep side streets of my neighborhood seemed already to be a dying breed.

But the pandemic is hurting everyone. The barrow men, who move furniture or heavy purchases for customers on pushcarts and survive on daily wages, ask for charity now from passers-by.

Still, when turning a corner one day, my heart lifted at the sight of the first cafe table set out on a tiny terrace. The owner was enjoying his Turkish coffee and view of the Bosporus, but we smiled and nodded.

3976,"&gt; Pretty low net contribution for Finland so not very impactful whether the EU budget goes up or down.

The suggested about doubling of EU budget would turn low net contribution to high net contribution, so it is an impactful issue. It doesn't double the net contribution, it doubles the total contribution. Also it would turn many countries that aren't currently net contributors into net contributors.


The real reason is that Finland doesn't need to form a stance on it, as it isn't going anywhere any way, and forming a stance would strain relations between the parties in the government coalition, as some parties would be in favor of the plan and some would oppose it.

Oil, gas and coal are resources that will soon become unavailable for use. Renewable resources are the future, for the sake of our planet and our subsistence.

I have seen comments here about how low the percentage of use of renewable resources actually is in Europe and it surprised me. In Portugal, the bills show what percentage of the energy consumed was generated from solar, wind, nuclear, etc, and i have NEVER seen a bill that showed less that 70% coming from the 3 main renewable sources: solar, wind and water. So you don't need to cover an entire country in solar panels to feed it. There are more renewable resources to explore.

Fertile land is also not meant to be explored all the time. The ground needs to recover nutrients and minerals. Intensive agriculture is a problem. We should actually have more free land. ACTUALLY free land. Nothing growing there, nothing being built. Just nature. These solar panels aren't ruining anything, not the soil, not the economy, not the planet. Yes, solar panels on roofs are great, but they're also mounted on people's homes and are mostly for personal use. This field is feeding cities. And maybe, if we need to occupy every m2 of fertile land to feed/host the world population or just even 1 continent's, maybe the issue is overpopulation and not actually land availability.",,/r/europe/comments/gp76zw/solar_farm_in_portugal/frmh2un/,fi_pereira,1590300818

4008,"&gt;Logic? France has territory in South America, are they an American country? No, it's European. It's governed from Europe, originates from Europe and its population is mostly in Europe.

According to whose logic, according to which criteria? This is what your thick head seems to not get so i'll push it harder.

Turkey has land in Europe.

Turkey has millions living in Europe.

Turkey is a member of Council of Europe, European Custom Union, Eu-Med partnership. And even though it is in dire spot, still a candidate for EU itself. 

Istanbul - a city in Turkey, selected as European Capital of Culture in 2010 and sports in 2012. These are all under Europe's organizations.

So logic to a normal person would suggest there is little to no problem for Turkey to be listed in European countries.

Your logic fails you because you seem to think a country can only belong to one continent. Which is not surprising, considering the thickness.

The amount of ""muh Europe"" people here is astonishing. **Both** geopoliticaly and geologically, Turkey is part of Europe and Asia.

And for your amazing ""come back"":

&gt;France has territory in South America, are they an American country? No, it's European.

If a country is considered within a geopolitical or geological area, yes they are very much a ""x"" country if they wish to be. You don't get to redefine things as you wish on a per-case scenario.

So saying Turkey is not European is as stupid as saying Cyprus is Asian. Either do both or neither so at least your stupidity is consistent.

4048,"From my POV, most of the resistance against solar + wind isn't that it does not work on a limited scale. But that it doesn't work as panacea to all of our energetical problems.

For instance, Portugal and Spain has many sunny days, so its a great location for solar panels. Netherland has many windy places, good place for wind. Denmark has a good coastline with a source for many wave/tidal plants. With EU pressure, all of them could probably reach 20% of renewables without much problem (bar the network instability and unpredictability).

But then you have landlocked countries with little sunlight and no much wind. The *maximal* capacity of these sources might be up to 20% if you really really want and make huge inefficient investments. There is no way these countries can realistically reach 20% of their energy production with sun and wind, so different solutions are required.

A buffer state exists to provide separation between powers.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_state

&gt; A buffer state is a country lying between two rival or potentially hostile greater powers. Its existence can sometimes be thought to prevent conflict between them. A buffer state is sometimes a mutually agreed upon area lying between two greater powers, which is demilitarized in the sense of not hosting the military of either power (though it will usually have its own military forces). The invasion of a buffer state by one of the powers surrounding it will often result in war between the powers. 

We have ocean in both sides of the US.  How can Europe even conceivably act as a buffer state?  And provide a buffer relative to whom?

Anyone invading the US is going to need to be able to win a naval war against the US, and if they're going to do that, they can sail their ships from wherever they want.

If the US primary concern was separation, the Atlantic and Pacific and Arctic make for pretty substantial separation.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/gozori/nato_allies_alarmed_annoyed_by_us_open_skies_exit/frm9570/,duisThias,1590294425

Berdaches (also called Two-Spirits) are Amerindians who mix gender roles, effectively becoming third-sex. Ethnographers and archeologists have found such third genders across the world, from native America to Melanesia to west Africa and more. Some of these societies featured multiple genders and their own specific customs about marriage between them, including transgendered and homosexual marriage.

4197,"&gt;You said PiS is supported by the majority of Polish people in their goal to make the country a shithole. The simple fact of 46%&lt;50% eluded you somehow.

PiS got 43,6% in 2019, the even more right-conservative KON with the exact same if not more radical programme towards minorities and especially LGBT people got 6,8%. 43,6 + 6,8 is 50,4 or in other words a majority of the voting populace. This means that of the poles who had enough of an opinion on the current course to vote, a majority supported it. MY GOD.

&gt;Also, there are more minority groups than Roma, Jews and gays, so again the data is pretty narrow

Ah so because it isn't literally an exhaustive list of every minority there is the overall claims that the anti-LGBT-course of PiS, literally the reason for this thread, suddenly isn't fairly representative of the polish populace?

&gt;Better yet, Poland doesn't have a majority in every category, kind of going against what you said.

Poland has no majority of acceptance in any category other than jews (where it still ranks second to last in all surveyed countries), and the only category where it is a deadlock is homosexuality, with 47% supporting, 42% against it and 11% abstaining. Your claim which I am arguing against that the majority of poles is pro LGBT is hereby false. 

&gt;This discussion is fairly low quality

The discussion is low quality because you refuse to accept the articles given and demand sources while not actually reading them until I lay out again and again why you should. So we're not gonna play this game this one-sided anymore.

Because as it turns out, nobody cares for minority rights, most people only care on improving their own life standard and only if they're already extremely satisfied with their quality of life start becoming ideological and moral highground defenders. Ergo, the majority doesn't give a single shit about minority rights or abortion rights because it doesn't concern them. Why is that so hard to swallow?

You can counteract this with a diverse political party spectrum so that one party can't just hoard all the votes with populist propaganda, but at the end of the day Poland is a young democracy with a good historical base to pull a nationalist victim card and as such has to figure things out on their own. Look at Germany's political landscape post WW2, it took 50 years for the highly conservative centre right party to actually not be the by far strongest force in the government, because thats how long it took for people to become accustomed to their newfound life standards. If Poland has a robust constitution as Germany had/has, this doesn't mean the end of democracy.

The north pleaded for years for the south to reform; increase your income base( by battling the shadow economy, corruption, tax avoidance/evasion) or you have to cut spending.

This abuse of antibiotics increases the chances of creating antibiotic resistant bacteria that would also make such antibiotics obsolete to humans.

quoting climate scientists from the article:  
""As far as ice cores go back, there is no episode with such rapid rates of increase in greenhouse gases. Before ice core records, the temporal resolution becomes more challenging, but **even fast warming events seem to have happened on much slower timescales than what is happening today** ""

and:

""**It’s wrong to say that because climate has changed in the past, either we aren’t causing climate change, or it is no big deal and we will survive. Quite the contrary.** The evidence of past change shows that climate can change pretty wildly, given even a little push. And we are pushing it pretty hard. Sure, humanity survived some past climate change, but at least during the “Holocene” time when agriculture developed and civilizations flourished, climate has been relatively stable. And the smallish changes that occurred had a pretty major impact of biblical proportion… famines, floods, mass migration, heat waves, killing frosts. So maybe we survived. But it wasn’t fun. And some civilizations collapsed. I don’t think we want that.

**We are changing climate much more, and much faster, and on a much larger scale, than anything humanity experienced in its early history.** I’m discounting the Neanderthals who lived in southern Europe during the ice ages — I don’t want to be a cave man and I don’t think we want to go there.""

"" It is very risky to keep emitting because of the rate and magnitude of change. **As far as we know today, there has been no similar event in terms of rate of change in climate history. What we refer to as “fast” changes in the geological record happened on much slower time scales than what we see today**. It is an open question if and how ecosystems will adapt to such fast changes""

4894,"&gt;First, there are strings attached because it's part of the EU budget so it's not the Italians who decide how to spend the money but the EU Commission and all 27 states.


There are basically no strings attached because the EU is unable to enforce them. There are plenty of examples of member states going against EU guidelines and regulations without consequence.

Having a debt ratio of maximum 60% being one of the examples. The EU had no way to enforce this and butted head with Italy over its budget as recently as last year. But no, Italy had to elect a twat like Salvini into power so ignoring the EU while they kept overspending seemed like a good idea.

&gt;Second, refusing to give access to your water-well when your neighbor's house is on fire and the whole neighborhood is made of wooden houses including your own is childish and outright dangerous.

That's not an apt comparison. The Dutch government is not denying access completely, it just does not want to give money away for free and would like the amount to be paid back in the future. Which is *entirely* reasonable.

A more reasonable comparison would be that it wouldn't be the first time my neighbor's house caught fire, which would make me wonder if it wouldn't be reasonable to invest in fire safety equipment. Italy's request is also more comparable to having my neighbor demand money to cover the costs of rebuilding the house, rather than asking for water to put the fire out.

The loan my government gave to Greece during the last recession has yet to be paid back, after all, and has sharply increased support for Eurosceptists when it happened. If the current government would just give in to demands and hand over money, there's a high chance the next government would be a Eurosceptic one. The ruling parties can't and won't take that risk for the sole sake of solidarity.

You can't expect wealthier member states to keep channeling money to weaker economies whenever their house catches fire while they seem to take little to no precaution and don't learn lessons from previous incidents.

&gt;Third the Italians have been managing their budget as well as the other EZ states. The only reason why they couldn't lower their debt-to-GDP ratio was because their GDP wasn't growing over these years while countries everywhere else were growing. So no, Italians weren't reckless over the last 10 years, they simply were unlucky.

If the Italians managed their budget as well as other EZ states they would not have butted heads with the EU over budget concerns. They also would be more capable of taxing their population, which they barely do judging by the sheer size of Italy's shadow economy (which will just increase when handing out grants, because let's not forget that it has one of the highest corruption rates in the EU).

There's also no way that I'd believe for even one second that Italy, a country that seems pleased enough with Berlusconi's performance as PM for 9 years to elect him to the EP and has a Eurosceptic movement large enough to elect twats like Salvini into government positions, would be happy to give in to the demands they're making of certain countries if the roles were reversed.",Gelderland (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/gofkta/conte_warns_he_does_not_consider_the_planned_500/frjhvyr/,Nolenag,1590233218

Not all that much, according to a study by four University of Copenhagen economists. Denmark enacted tight social-distancing controls, while neighboring Sweden left restaurants and shops open—which made for a convenient natural experiment in what Covid-19 lockdowns do to an economy.

Export-heavy Sweden is expected to suffer a downturn despite its easygoing Covid-19 strategy, but the authors find that consumer spending, in particular, didn’t perform much better there. Looking at bank data, they found that “aggregate spending dropped by around 25 percent in Sweden and, as a result of the shutdown, by 4 additional percentage points in Denmark”—a small price for public health, depending on how one looks at it.",,/r/europe/comments/goyywk/pandemic_shutdown_and_consumer_spending_lessons/fritrd8/,JackRogers3,1590209207

Many more examples are out there. Instead of being able to put them behind bars for their unexplained wealth and the clear-cut cases of extortion and bribery, the investigators themselves were fired, by Shokin. It's safe to say Ukraine has never had a non-corrupt prosecutor general, with the possible exception of the one just fired, who was probably not corrupt but ineffectual and could not stop the corruption of his underlings anyway.

5308,"&gt;Firstly Italy is a net payer in the EU for decades. 

I didn't claim to the contrary, did I? I'm saying Italy's economy was mismanaged because they're *demanding* free money to prevent its economy from being on the brink of the collapse. Italy ignoring its debt problem despite being called on it by the EU more than once because they wanted to be Eurosceptic rebels doesn't entitle them to any money.

&gt;Secondly a lot of the huge trade surplus the Netherlands, Germany and others had over the years is a direct effect of Italy and others spending money, so you should at least be aware when you criticize Italy's Budgetary policy that your own country has more tax income because of it.

Why would you bring this is up? It's irrelevant. Just because my government benefitted financially doesn't make Italy's overspending while with a debt of ~130% any less retarded. And it still does not entitle them to any money. Money they've spent isn't theirs anymore, because that's how money works and why currency exists in the first place.

&gt;And thirdly, the purpose of the recovery fund is to repair the damage that was done by the coronavirus and not to pay back italy's old debt. 

No, it's to protect from the effects of the coming recession caused by COVID-19. Something which the whole planet will suffer from, not just Italy. Italy's just going to hit harder because they've been Eurosceptic twats who irresonspibly ignored the debt and went agianst EU guidelines outlined after the 2008 recession to limit debt rates to max 60% to protect against future recessions.

The high debt Italy managed to rack up makes it impossible to borrow money at low rates, so they're trying to procure money via other means.

&gt;I think it's fair from Italy, who got hit very hard by the virus and who contributed a lot to the EU for decades, to demand a common european answer to this crisis.

I agree that there should be a common European answer to this crisis, but I do hope people understand that demanding free money with no strings attached isn't a reasonable demand to make and is never going to happen.

And I think too much focus is being put on the damage caused by the virus, as a lot of politicians are using it as a political tool to gain sympathy and shift focus away from their own failings.

The most disgraceful thing is that politicians are using this tragedy as emotional blackmail to get money on favourable terms.",Gelderland (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/gofkta/conte_warns_he_does_not_consider_the_planned_500/friayi6/,Nolenag,1590196506

LOL, I guess you're referring to Mitt Romney's ""model"" implemented in Massachusetts.  Sorry, he's a Republican-in-name-only, and Mass is one of the bluest states in the union.  This was not a ""Republican proposal""; it was a Democrat law passed by a Democrat legislature, but signed by a RINO governor.

Obama ran roughshod over the ""long-standing norms"" regarding limits to executive power, while Pelosi and Schumer ran roughshod over ""long-standing norms"" regarding congressional rules.

5335,"&gt; Does it? Because when you look at countries like Iran, the only amount of money that it reduced is the one people have to feed themselves. The fundings for groups abroad like the Hezbollah are still there.

I think it does.  Iran's national income is drastically reduced by the sanctions.  Its people are eating much the same amount as they have always eaten before.

&gt; Well, actually the Hezbollah is literally the result of sanctions that justified the ayatollah's hardline.

Citation needed.  Wikipedia says ""Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israeli occupation"" of south Lebanon.

&gt; Honestly, Cuba, a tiny island in the Caribbean gave the middle finger to the US for decades. Fidel Castro died a billionaire at 90 in his bed with the hammer and sickle still flying high, and you think we can put effective sanctions on Putin and Russia?

Because Europe undermined the embargo against Cuba, just like it is undermining the sanctions against Iran.

Oh yeah it does. Access to products for a lot of people is complicated, and some people definitely don't have access to as much food as they should in many parts. I've been there, don't worry about the mosques being convered in fancy ornaments and revolutionary guards having their rifles with full magazines though. Which is what keeps the mollahs in power alright, 42 years and counting. 

You conveniently ignores the entire Islamic Revolution movement that has spread in the whole region with dozens of terrorist groups that didn't exist before Iran was designed as a black sheep and got sanctions.

&gt; Citation needed. Wikipedia says ""Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israeli occupation"" of south Lebanon.

Now why Iran started founding such a group? Right after they became a target of sanctions no less. Some digging on your own on contemporary Iranian history should be done, I'm not gonna copy and paste entire articles.

5420,"I'm getting really tired here. It feels like I'm talking to twelve year olds that have a hobby of nitpicking another person's arguments without themselves coming up with any kind of argument for why a wealth transfer is the only possible option for countries like Italy to survive/get out of this crisis. But here goes (again):

&gt;You think endemic long-term problems can be solved in a couple of years? Right in the middle of a massive economic crisis? 

Couple of years?? 12 years isn't a couple of years. Downplaying the amount of time makes it so your argument becomes mute. 12 years is a large amount of time and in those twelve years they could have done way more than deciding to tackle tax evasion in September of 2019 (the date your article is from)

&gt;About what? About the claim that you can't ""prove"" an economic prediction about future? That was what I was claiming.

No, about the claim you made when you said that, and I quote: ""By that logic, every argument is ""rhetoric""""

You going back and editing your comment so this part is no longer there just makes it so you are even more disingenuous than I previously thought. That is just being deceitful and a liar.

&gt;Focus, please. 

Before going into the rest that comes after this quote, are you really blaming me of lacking focus? After you having said that arguments can never be backed by proof, after you moving the goalposts etc? Please look in the mirror first...

&gt;This isn't about which economists are right.

You literally asked me the following question: ""What's the motivation of the actual economists?"" You never said you meant why do economist think the break up of the EU is a real possibility. Again moving the goalposts. You are not having an honest discussion. You are constantly moving goalposts, nitpicking my arguments without even once giving any kind of argument as to why a wealth transfer is the only possible solution to Italy and others' problems.

And I should not even stoop so low as to answer, but I will. Off course economist will say this is a possibility, because it is. If no help whatsoever would be forthcoming Italy and others would have loads of problems and them leaving the Eurozone and EU would absolutely be a possibility. This however does not mean that every economists agrees that the only way to remedy the situation is for a wealth transfer to occur. 

&gt;Finally. Yes, I'm aware about the ECB measures. Why are those kinds of transfers better than this proposal?

You're now only talking about the ECB measures. I also mentioned other options instead of a wealth transfer (again being disingenuous and again nitpicking my arguments without giving any kind of argument as to why a wealth transfer is necesarry).

But, again I will answer. Those aren't transfers. Those are measures taken by the ECB. Countries don't have to literally go and get more indebted because of these measures. There is a world of difference between these kind of measures and the wealth transfer now being demanded. (And if you are really interested, I absolutely think QE is a bad policy only instituted because the ECB is lead by ""The South"").

&gt;Sure. but I already explained why adding even more debt to an already too-much-in-debt country seems counterproductive. You can give grants with strings too, btw.

Again nonsense. I have clearly laid out reforms that would make it so that Italy can in the long run easily repay these loans (with low interest rates because of ECB interference). They are just unwilling to accept any kinds of reforms attached to loans, they even don't accept having to do reforms for grants.

And yes, you can attach strings to grants, this however does not change the facts that these grants are not necessary and are a wealth transfer from countries that don't have massive tax avoidance and corruption to a country that does. And Italy also has clearly stated it won't accept reforms as part of the proposals.",,/r/europe/comments/gnss63/merkels_milestone_moment_german_chancellor_writes/frhz3fo/,IdiAmini,1590189478

5429,"It's a bit more complicated than that. In Germany, the Federal Council (which works rather similar to the Council of the EU, so it consists of the governments of the member states) gets to vote in two ways:

* When a law directly impacts the member states, e.g. financially, the Federal Council has to agree for the law to pass.
* Otherwise, it passes by default, but the Federal Council may vote to block it. Then the Parliament can vote again to override this block.

In the first case, the abstentions count towards ""no"", so the law can't go into effect. In the second case it counts towards ""don't block"", so abstentions actually help when passing the law.

The point here is that due to being a federation, it's hard to pass a federal law that goes against the will or interests of the member states.

Sometimes state governments will vote quite differently than the members of parliament of the respective parties. The reason is that in general, a majority in parliament will support giving powers to the federal government, as the federal government is supported by a majority of them. On the other hand, state governments will generally be more in favor of leaving powers with the states, for obvious reasons.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/gon5aj/the_composition_of_germanys_second_chamber/frhzddo/,muehsam,1590189635

5472,"The federal council represents the states, not the people. Each state votes en bloc. The fairest way to give votes to states in such a scenario is by proportional to the square root of the population. The reason for this is mathematical.

If you would give each state exactly one vote, small states would have an advantage. If you would give each state the number of votes proportional to their population, large states would have an advantage. Imagine one state would have 50% of the population. In that case, that state could essentially vote alone, and all other votes wouldn't matter. And even though no single state is that dominant in modern Germany, it would still give a huge advantage to large states.

In the EU the current system is messed up, because it essentially combines the one country, one vote rule that favors small countries with the population rule that favors large countries. Back when the constitution was discussed, Poland, as a medium sized country, strongly pushed for the square root, but since most EU countries aren't medium sized, it wasn't adopted.

The German Federal Council is very, very similar to the Council of the EU in nature, but the states actually do get a number of votes that's roughly proportional to the square root of their populations (though a bit capped on the upper and lower end).",Germany,/r/europe/comments/gon5aj/the_composition_of_germanys_second_chamber/fri1390/,muehsam,1590190614

5476,"&gt;Was it ""fair"" for US citizens to finance Germany (and the rest of Europe) via the Marshall Plan after WW2?

Again with the Marshall Plan. I ignored it at first, but do you actually know how much money was involved in that so called grand rescue plan for Germany? I'm betting you don't, because if you did you would not compare this proposal by Germany and France to the Marshall Plan. Read up on it and come back to me...

Furthermore, comparing this to an actual war and the devastation caused by war is just ridiculous. Restaurants will still be there, they won't be demolished. Yes owners might go bankrupt, but others will replace them. The comparison is just straight up bonkers.

&gt;No, it is not ""fair"". I agree. But it is not about fairness

Yes it is. If you think it is not, we are in disagreement and will not be able to come to any kind of understanding. Italy flat out refuses any kind of reforms, yet demands a wealth transfer and is now saying 500 billion isn't even enough. They want more, more, more money to compensate for their own past **and present** transgressions. If this isn't about fairness, then please go to Denmark and tell the construction worker that hasn't seen his income grow in comparison to cost of living for 10 straight years that this isn't about fairness. That they will have to suffer a bit longer because Italy is incapable (and unwilling) to do the necessary reforms needed to become a more competitive economy. That Italy is unable or unwilling to really tackle structural problems such as tax evasion and corruption. 

&gt;No, I don't know and you're not actually explaining anything

Something that reflects this very nicely is the 1 billion euro project to start combining EU member state procurement and R&amp;D projects to increase spending in military. This resulted into a warning letter from Ellen Lord (Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Sustainment) and Andrea L. Thompson (Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs) last year to stop the project as there was fears for EU countries buying less US equipment. Essentially US could care less about European countries taking a bigger role in their own defense and the the only thing they wanna see is European countries spending more on their equipment.

Being disingenuous does not help your argument. If Italy can so easily borrow money, why doesn't it just borrow the money on the market it needs for their recovery like the so called ""frugal four'""  are able to do??

&gt;In worst case scenario, italy has 4000 billions of private saving to tax and 100 billions in gold reserves... so well you know, we don't really need you.

Please do. And tackle the huge amount of tax evasion as well while you're at it. I welcome this idea, finally you're admitting a wealth transfer isn't necessary because Italy can finance their recovery on their own apparently..

&gt;Tax havens are stealing money from other countries, Netherlands cyprus and ireland are disgusting.

Italian citizens don't have any ground to stand on concerning this (admitted) problem. If the 200 billion a year tax evasion were not happening within Italy, they would not need this wealth transfer. If this proposal goes through, we can all say with 100% confidence that Italian citizens have stolen loads of money from the citizens of the ""frugal four"". They have already done this by the way. If the Italian government were to have 200 billion euros in extra revenue they could contribute more to the EU budget, meaning others would have to contribute less. So Italian citizens are already literally stealing money from other EU citizens.

&gt;the common response to covid it's only the normal course of action for an integrated economy as the european one. 

Nonsense. Other countries are able to respond to this crisis without demanding a money transfer. The reason Italy is demanding this money transfer is because of past and present transgressions they want others to now pay for.

&gt;And yes, as the third economy and long time contributor, we have all the rights to demand, no ask

If that's the case, countries that contribute more per capita have every right to not give in to these absolutely unreasonable demands. You can't have your cake and eat it...

Before Hitler managed to send any reinforcements to his defeated ally, the Greeks had already occupied Rome, heading towards the newly created state of Vichy France. By December 1940, the siege of Paris had begun and on the 24th of December, Greek tanks paraded by the Eiffel Tower, preparing for their final invasion of the Reich's heartland in January 1941. Having dealt with the Germans, the Greek forces set out to root out all fascism in Europe, defeating Franco's regime and claiming what was left of the Italian state in Libya.

5544,"&gt;This is what the average joe doesn’t understand. These problems are all being tackled. This is national politics, it doesn’t get solved in the snap of a finger. Being able to fund your institutions properly is what makes these processes go faster, which is why these high interest rates don’t help. You have not dismissed my points, you’ve just shown how naive you are on the subject. For you to say that Italy isn’t solving these problems you have to have very little knowledge on how these institutions handle.

* It's being handled so efficiently that since 2008 the tax evasion still exists. It's been 12 years and in those 12 years Italy has managed to be the first to get their budget refused by the EU and have elected anti EU populists to government. 

&gt;Being able to fund your institutions properly is what makes these processes go faster

Again not true. If the willingness were there, this would have been dealt with a lot harsher, faster and more efficiently. The willingness just isn't there.

The 2nd and 3rd biggest economies have offered nothing in return for this program or is Italy going to make some much needed reforms? If you are referring to the European Single market, as what they are offering, that goes both ways. You get access to our market as well. 

And on top of that you are blatantly lying: 

1. The taxes and dues in Germany are the [highest in the OECD](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/german-expat-news/oecd-study-germany-leads-world-taxes-and-social-contributions). [Here's](https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article207627587/OECD-Bei-Steuern-und-Abgaben-ist-Deutschland-Spitzenreiter.html) even a chart for you, so you can see where Italy is in comparison. 
2. Your inheritance tax is a complete [joke (see page 50)](https://www.ifo.de/DocDL/dice-report-2018-2-drometer-frank-hofbauer-p%C3%A9rez-rhode-schworm-stitteneder.pdf). 
3. Salvini's ""Quota 100"" allows you to retire much earlier and your pensions are significantly higher. Which is why you have to spend a significantly higher [amount of your GDP](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Pensions_benefits,_2016_(%25,_relative_to_GDP)_AE2019.png) on pension benefits. Funded by debt. 
4. The [average wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult) of Italians is higher than that of Germans (so yes you are rich enough) and your median wealth is significantly higher which means wealth in your country is distributed much more even, despite your North-South divide. 

Who accumulated those debts and benefited from them? You had no issue spending all that money. Now you complain about the interest rates despite them being on a record low for you due to the EZB policy. Feel free to go default or make a debt cut, since right now it is largely italian banks and italian citizens who are creditors of Italy with French bank being the 2nd largest creditor. 

Simply shouting ""We want money!"" isn't going to fix any of your largely self inflicted problems and Germany has already contributed much more to the EU budget than any other member state ever will.

The first one already is a near purely representative chamber, where the seat distribution is pretty much based on popular vote of the entire population. (It's a bit more complicated, but that's pretty much how it ends up)

Having the second chamber be exactly like that as well would be redundant and not really change anything. So this one is for the states, and for that even the smallest ones need a proper voice. So: 3 votes are the minimum, no matter how small, 6 are the maximum, no matter how large. There is a mathematical key based on how many votes a state gets so it is pretty much distributed automatically should a state rise or fall from a threshold. So it's not like the US where the number of seats is pretty static which results in all kinds of fucked distribution.

The US' problem (for example, there are quite a few nations with that problem IIRC) on that note would be that it's two chambers are redundant in the opposite way: they BOTH represent the states, neither represent the people. So both chambers are ridden by FPTP and gerrymandering and there is no counterbalance to it.

Oh come on, dude.

1) Facile comparisons don't help to have a reasonable debate

2) It's not even a good comparison. Italy didn't kill anyone (except maybe themselves). A better comparison would if you had a relative who was a drug addict that ruined their finances and their credit rating. And they got better and started fixing their life, slowly and imperfectly, but still with some progress. But then an unprecedented storm hit your town, and their house (already in bad shape due to lack of funds) got especially hard hit. And their house is next to yours and if it collapses it would damage yours too (which was already damaged by the storm, but less than theirs). And they're asking for help, because their credit is so bad that they can get only ruinous loans, and preferably to directly pay for fixing a part of the house (you choose what, hire the people, etc) instead of another loan so as not to damage their credit even more, which will lead them to an even worse financial future, including having less funds to maintain the house long term. Sure, you can mutter about their past drug addiction and everything, but will it get the house fixed? Except, of course even that is not a good comparison, because states are not people, and state finances are not personal finances, and there are more factors and details involved, etc, which is why see 1)

Though you know where your comparison would actually work? Germany after WW2. And they did get a lot of help via the Marshall Plan. Thank God people running the US at the time weren't thinking in your way.

&gt;And you haven't given any reason for ""the North"" to accept a wealth transfer to ""the South"". Not one.

I have, that it will destroy the EU if you don't. You may disagree about the likelihood, but I *gave a reason*.

&gt;There are loads of other instruments that can (and already are in some degree) be used instead of a wealth transfer. 

Which ones? Which ones do you think would work and be sufficient?

&gt;You know the same austerity you guys constantly complain about.

I am not from the South. I'm not even from an EU country. I'm just an interested outside observer.

5688,"The US federal Senate represents the states. Each state gets 2 votes in the senate, no matter the population (California has 40 million people, Alaska has 700,000, both get 2 votes). I think it's the same idea as to preserve the sovereignty of the states a bit as in Germany. 

All federal legislation has to be approved by both the senate and the federal lower house. Then the senate also has to approve treaties by a 2/3rds vote, and the senate confirms all the cabinet level officials and federal judges after the president appoints them.

5704,"&gt;Saying Derkach is a KGB/FSB agent because he graduated a KGB academy would make Lutsenko a KGB/FSB agent as well, because (surprise-surprise) he graduated from there as well.

Surprise-surprise! You don't know what you're talking about, yet again. Lutsenko [has an engineering degree from Lviv university](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9B%D1%83%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE_%D0%AE%D1%80%D1%96%D0%B9_%D0%92%D1%96%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%96%D0%B9%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87).

&gt;I will repeat my point - you can't blame Derkach. That's like blaming the U.S. for reconnaissance flights over Cuba, during one of which the Soviet missiles were discovered.

Blame? I don't blame him for anything. In this Russian active measures campaign (having relatively little to do with Ukraine per se, and mostly being about the US presidential election), he's just the talking head, prominent solely because of his MP status.

&gt;The significance of the tapes stems from the fact that this is the first time ever this has been recorded - it can be used as actual evidence in court, instead of rumors. Everyone, of course, knows that since 2015, but the courts do not.

5757,"&gt; This union in our minds is not a union of distributing income.

Yet income is very much distributed, from the ""south"" to the ""north"". Without free movement of capital and payments, goods, services, labour, and the relinquished control over monetary policy, the wide open consumption-driven economies wouldn't bleed income towards the outside. And the supply-driven economies, relying on exporting their production, wouldn't be doing so well.

There is a reason even the recent ordoliberal-dominated European treaties recommend that countries keep in check their current account surplus. It is so that the Eurozone and the EU can be a stable area that converges, not diverges to the point that countries will be forced to protect themselves.

&amp;nbsp;

If the economic stimulus related to the needs differ too much in the various member states, the symmetric shock will become an asymmetric and long lasting shock, meaning the already diverging countries will diverge a lot farther. There are actual worries in Brussels, both the Parliament and the Commission. It's not about Italy bad, it's about 1/ The size of economic stimulus needed in the entire EU, 2/ The symmetry of the stimulus, and 3/ How it is done to avoid divergence over time (e.g. with regards to debt and forced austerity policies, since that's what NL, AU, DK and SW are going to ask for)",,/r/europe/comments/gofkta/conte_warns_he_does_not_consider_the_planned_500/frgtpdj/,_Handsome_Jack,1590168078

You can bash the ""frugal four"" all you want, but this is just BS. This isn't an incident. Their excessive debt is structural. They need to reform. But every time a French President tries to reform, they all go out and strike. Do it in Italy, and they switch to far-right parties.

I don't care how they get it together, but they need to get it together first, before even bringing up the subject of a shared EU debt.

The world’s top luxury brands make much of their European heritage, but their future is looking more Chinese than ever. However this contradiction plays out in the long run, it poses one immediate problem: too many boutiques on their home continent.

Amid all the uncertainty about how the Covid crisis will change business, it is probably safe to say that designer brands will be more reliant than ever on sales to Chinese shoppers—and on Chinese turf.

Before the new coronavirus hit, labels like Birkin handbag maker Hermès and trench coat specialist Burberry were already making more than a third of their world-wide sales to consumers from China, who overtook Americans as the top luxury shoppers by nationality back in 2011. The crisis may amplify the trend as Chinese consumers recover their appetite for top-end handbags and watches faster than Americans and Europeans. Burberry, which reported its full-year numbers Friday, said shoppers have queued outside some reopened boutiques in mainland China.

The International Monetary Fund expects the current health crisis to hit the U.S. and European economies harder than China. And Chinese luxury consumers, who are almost two decades younger and less indebted than their Western counterparts, can afford to spend a larger chunk of their disposable income on designer baubles. Already there are signs of what stock analysts are calling “revenge spending” as lockdowns lift in Chinese cities and shoppers head to the mall. Consulting firm Bain estimates that by 2025, up to 49% of global luxury sales will be made to Chinese shoppers, an increase from the consulting firm’s earlier forecast of 46%.

The expectation of a fairly rapid, China-led recovery partly explains why some luxury stocks have been resilient this year, despite forecasts of a 35% fall in industry sales this year compared with last—three times the decline recorded in 2009. Shares in Hermès are up 3% since the start of the year, while sector bellwether LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is down 14%. The Stoxx Europe 600 index has fallen 17%.

However, capturing spending by Chinese consumers is trickier now that worries about infection have hobbled long-haul travel. Last year, China’s shoppers made 70% of their luxury purchases abroad or in Hong Kong, often on overseas trips to Europe where it is much cheaper to buy designer goods. A Louis Vuitton Speedy 25 handbag currently costs 46% more in Shanghai than in a European boutique, according to a price comparison by analysts at brokerage Jefferies.

As air-passenger numbers aren’t expected to recover to pre-Covid levels until 2023, brands now need the Chinese to spend at home instead.

Bain estimates that sales made within mainland China itself will almost triple from 2019 levels to €88 billion by the middle of the decade. Some labels such as Gucci and Burberry already have plenty of boutiques in the country. Others like Christian Dior, owned by LVMH, have fewer. They are likely to open new outlets or invest heavily in online platforms and logistics to capture more spending through e-commerce.

Ramping up sales capacity in China has an awkward corollary in Europe. Brands will face tough decisions about whether they can afford to keep as many locations open closer to home—Prada currently has 230 stores in the region, for example. Last year, half of all sales made in European luxury shops were to overseas visitors.

Business has dried up overnight, with little immediate prospect of returning. Revenue generated in Europe is expected to be 14% lower by the middle of the decade than last year, Bain estimates. Labels understand the branding power of a store on the Rue Saint-Honoré in Paris or London’s Bond Street, but less prominent locations may be quietly closed up or downsized.

Brands probably have less to worry about in the U.S., where stores are far less dependent on sales to tourists. That said, the outlook is far from clear: The key to continued demand for luxury goods among well-heeled Americans is how well the stock market holds up.

The luxury sector isn’t as exposed to China as some other industries—mining giant BHP Group generates up to 70% of revenue there, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Tyler Broda—but it has raced ahead of other consumer categories. Even Apple made just 15% of its net sales there in the three months through December, before the Covid-19 outbreak closed its Chinese stores.

This dependence on one nationality carries risks, even if luxury companies have no choice. Aside from the possibility of a China-specific crisis, there is the question of brand image. Among Chinese consumers, there was a certain cachet in traveling to Europe to buy designer handbags or clothing that often weren’t available in local boutiques. And the marketing myth of European haute couture may be trickier to maintain when the locals show so little interest in the goods—though this has been the case for some years now.

As luxury brands turn further to the east, they will have to work hard to disguise an ever more lopsided look.

The sooner the vaccine is deployed the sooner the entire economy can restart. The vaccines they’re pre-producing might not work in testing, but if the do then that means they’ll have it ready sooner so the economy can restart that much sooner and every day counts.

I'm not sure about that, I know that the basic essential food stuff costs around the same as in Germany (and food in Germany is definitely cheaper than in other western countries) but other things are definitely cheaper here.",Cock,/r/europe/comments/gogr5y/hungary_nurses_get_between_286_and_486_after/frg2h74/,MLG_Blazer,1590153893

5983,"&gt;But I guess you're talking about the UK, right?

I'm talking about both the EU and UK nothing was agreed between them for 3.5 years even things where both sides agreed, such as citizens rights.

&gt;That's not true. You need a trade deal, no amount of politics will change that fact. Politicians come and go. Im absolutely certain that BoJo will be ousted, just like his predecessor

You clearly get your understanding of of UK politics from reddit, boris is probably one of the most popular PMs since thatcher according to polls i would bet money he'll be in for the next 10 years at least perhaps longer.  

Also May was ousted because she tried to cave EU demands and effectively remain an EU member in everything not name rather than walk away with no-deal. 

Boris became PM because people believed he would walk away from talks if the EU didn't back down.

If he agrees to the terms the EU is currently demanding rather than going with no-deal, he will be ousted just like May was and replaced by someone who will. 

&gt;That's not true. You need a trade deal

losing 0.1% - 0.2% of yearly GDP growth is less than optimal but its certainly not something the UK must avoid at all costs. Those kind of fluctuations happen all the time and most people don't even notice. 

&gt;For now, maybe. IF you need a couple years under WTO to really tank your economy to come back to your mind, then so be it.

You strike me as someone who gets his information from people in the Reddit comment section. I'm afraid your likely to be disappointed by the impact of brexit the forcasts weren't even predicting no-deal would cause a recession and the UK was expected to still grow faster than France and Germany.",,/r/europe/comments/gnpboq/michel_barnier_says_uk_has_no_automatic/frg2wpi/,DesignerEntrance3,1590154162
