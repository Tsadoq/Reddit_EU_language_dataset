2,"A Latvian mother already 418 days in a Danish custody due to SA extradition request, and Latvian authorities have finally decided to do something.

this story gained some publicity about a year ago, but it looks like it wasn't on Reddit

Misāne moved to Mozambique, a country neighbouring South Africa, in 2003. Over a decade later she married a South African man and had two children, but the union soon soured. Things reached a head when she refused to lend him money, and Misāne claims her husband was abusive.

She sought legal protection from her husband in 2017, which was granted by a South African court. However, her husband ended up getting custody of one of their daughters, which her lawyers said “only demonstrates corruption and lawlessness in the Republic of South Africa”.

In 2018, following a violent incident in which she claims she was raped and her other daughter was also allegedly attacked, Misāne decided to seek refuge in Latvia and she took both of her children and fled.

If Misāne is found guilty of abduction in South Africa, she will face a prison sentence of up to 15 years.

A Danish court this week decided to keep her in custody while admitting that the sentence had in fact been served and that the detainee should be released. However, the prosecutor upholds the extradition request, which means returning to prison.

Depends on which one but all four of them in three different
countries are reachable inside of three hours max, the closest
being ~45 min. away.

Not sure what you’re getting at. In that scenario the drive becomes
again the least reliable mode of the connection so you’re back to square

35,"I can’t be arsed quoting in my answer you’ll have to bear with me.

Splintering of Germany was a direct result of WW2. Calling it a WW2 era matter is perfectly accurate. 

The people of NI chose to be part of the UK. For a long time (and for many still today) NI has been the strongest champion of the union. When the Irish Free State was created the territories of Northern Ireland were given a choice to opt out and stay as part of the UK. The northern Irish has a month to decide by elected to choose to rejoin the UK on the very first day with the northern Irish prime minister saying “we do not want the world to think we had a moments hesitation”.

We are not illegally occupying Northern Ireland. They very much want to be part of the uk, no one has treat them worse than the catholics. We’re lucky to have them and they’re lucky to have us. This is kind of shit that made me reply in the first place, everyone outside of the UK seems to assume that everyone in Northern Ireland hates the UK. This is completely not the case, and everyone should stop romanticising it as if it is the case. Even after Brexit NI STILL didn’t vote majority Sinn Féin. 

Also, seeing as you’ve criticised my education I’ll criticise yours. When I say NI is a UK matter, I’m speaking the truth, because NI is part of the UK. How does no one understand this. It is the decision of the UK government whether to grant an independence referendum and, just like we did with Scotland, if NI votes overwhelmingly in favour of independence parties I’m sure we’ll get one. Unlike the rest of Europe (particularly Spain) we do actually give our people the choice to decide their future. Everyone is mass downvoting but can’t wrap their head around the simple fact that you’re all advocating for the splintering of my country and somehow you think this is totally fine and justified. You wouldn’t say that about any other country in the world. 

The UK (which again I apparently have to reiterate includes Northern Ireland) will look after NI as it has done since 1922. If they want to leave they will be able to, but right now they don’t. Stop. Romanticising. Our. Separatist. Movements.

278,"Sure, I could bore you with paragraphs and paragraphs on the flaws of the EU, but I'll keep it to a few points for now. The democratic processes within the EU are so indirect as to essentially be meaningless, and so member states are forced to adopt neoliberal economic policies regardless of whether or not their voting public supports them. The process of forced centralisation, most recently through the idea of a common EU army (which we in the UK were told was a ""dangerous fantasy""), is also clearly designed to erode national sovereignty, without any consent from the voting public. As somebody who believes nation states are important for a variety of reasons, this is also a major issue for me.

Sensible and coherent arguments against the EU are plentiful, and come from all sides of the political spectrum.

You can repeat that simplistic sentence in mildly reworded ways 50 more times, it still won't change the fact that you're making a division that doesn't exist. Unpaid labor is still labor and pensions don't solely reflect the contributions of an individual done through paid work. You clearly wish it would, but it doesn't. 

&gt;Actually, more and more countries are getting rid of this discrepancy, because they agree with me, that's it's discriminatory.

As equality spreads and men increasingly take their equal share in household work, that's fine. But only in societies where that is happening (which are mostly in Western Europe).

Your argument suffers from the textbook case of circular reasoning. You've arbitrarily decided unpaid work doesn't need to be considered when setting the retirement age and treat that as something widely accepted. 

Then you babble something nonsensical about 'cultural issues' and 'legal issues' as if the law wouldn't be the formal expression and codification of society's values and culture in itself. European *law* prohibits polygamy, slavery and hate speech because it goes against European *cultural values*. Other countries with different cultures allow some of these. Law isn't something absolute with clear-cut right-or-wrong answers.

absurd in a democratic system that one vote counts less than
others and it remains one of the most severe, systemic flaws
of the EU as a whole that this discrimination is baked into the
electoral process. At least in Germany, EU scepticism is to a
good extent attributable to that inequality.

So no, no country in the world makes their ""own"" trade agreements, the hint is in the name; trade **agreements** There are ALWAYS partners, ALWAYS other parties involved in the process, the only difference now is that the EU is no longer a partner but a competitor, and they'll be as relevant as they have ever been.

612,"One last thing - more as a thought experiment than anything else.

Many years ago, I read a book called **The Third World War** by a group of authors headed by a retired general called John Hackett (wounded with the Paras at Arnhem).

It was written in 1978 and is written as if it was a history book describing the events of a NATO-Warsaw Pact war in the near-future early 80s, which ends with the mutual nuclear destruction of Birmingham and Minsk. 

The last bit of the book is fascinating, laying out the way that the denizens of this fictional Europe, now freed of the Cold War, reorganise the continent.

What Hackett and co describe is a system of ""triple nationality"" and ""triple tax status"" - there's a big, overarching federal EU government which does stuff like trade policy, defence etc and collects some taxes to do all that with.

Things like bins, road mending etc are dealt with on a local basis, with very small local authorities able to set their own rates of tax and spending.

In the middle of these is the national level, which deals with things like culture and education but - and here's the interesting bit - is essentially divorced from geography. Europeans are essentially free to self-identify as whatever nationality they want - because it's essentially irrelevant. It's basically the Good Friday Agreement solution but applied across a continent. Someone living in Barcelona could be ""Spanish"" or ""Catalan"" and it just means which TV station gets their licence fee (I know they don't have that there but an example).

It's an interesting sign of the times, btw, that while constructing all these castles in the sky, the authors note that this structure might *even* allow the two Germanies to have some small joint institutions...

Whether one proves one's nationality by a passport or an ID card is completely irrelevant because they state the same thing.

The only thing that will change after 2021 is that, when entering the UK with an EU document, the border officer will say : You can stay for 90 days (or whatever they will determine), whereas now they say : You can stay for however long you want.

Yes, it would also entail taking a lot of money from national budgets and handing it over to be redistributed. 

In the UK the national government provides £2,000 - £5,000 extra per person to Scotland, Wales and NI. In the US the federal government provides up to $10,000 per person to the poorest states. In the EU, the money going to even the poorest states is around a few hundred Euros per person.

More integration (or even making the current level work properly) will mean the EU budget expanding enormously and taxpayers in the richest states paying for a lot of benefits in the poorest.

The EU budget works on a less intrusive level then a Nation Budget, so it's way less of a ""bully"" than lets says Westminster, ... 

Delusional... Poland is refusing to comply with the EU at almost every turn. Poland got to where it is because they sued Germany to pay up for WW2 damage...

&gt; Europe before the 1st world war was an explosion waiting to happen due the fall of empires and the rise of nationalism! No country was an agressor , it was just War. The second sone though... Yes Germany's fault. You mention 3 times, what was the other? Franco-Prussian war? Like that's one of the Goals of the EU stop the wars that we have been fighting for over a thousand years! 

Nationalism is good. It is what creates diverse, unique countries... The EU it trying to turn europe into one homogeneous landmass, erasing diversity of countries while spouting that countries need more ""diversity""...

&gt; Germans have the same right to speak as any other citizen of Europe.

They really shouldn't... Letting one of the worst behaved countries in the last century run the show... Do you let your kids hang out with gangbangers??

I embrace technology. I don’t believe that all people fit in a certain mold whether it be Millennial or Boomer; Muslim or Christian; or Conservative or Liberal. Everyone is nuanced and that’s awesome! I like the differences. I learn from them and hope that I might have something to teach. 

I don’t believe people deserve respect because of their status or title or ranking. Respect is earned by one’s good acts, particularly when NOT taken with the expectation of being seen. I refuse to stereotype people because of their race, beliefs, age, sexual identity, or any other factor. There is good and bad in everyone. (Hopefully more good!) In my world, everyone starts with a clean slate, regardless of where they came from, what they look like, what they’ve experienced in life (or haven’t), or how much money is in their wallet.

Now it seems like it’s time for something cheesy like, “if everyone believed this, the world would be a better place.” But, would it? Or wouldn’t the mere act of saying that negate everything I just said?

A German military aircraft carrying 128 evacuees [from Wuhan](https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-vaccine-a-race-against-time/a-52174737) landed at Frankfurt Airport on Saturday afternoon.

The flight suffered delays earlier in the day after it was blocked stopping in Russia for crew-change and refueling. 

Moscow refused to allow the plane to land due to ""lack of capacity"" at the airport, and the Airbus A310 had to be diverted to Helsinki instead.

&amp;#x200B;

A Federal Ministry of Health official said the plane was carrying 110 German citizens, according to Germany's DPA press agency. Doctors were also on board to monitor the passengers. 

The returnees are expected to be quarantined at an army barracks near Frankfurt airport. None of the German citizens who are to be repatriated are suspected of having contracted the virus, according to Germany's Foreign Ministry.

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the plane had delivered aid to Chinese authorities in Wuhan battling the outbreak, including 10,000 protective suits requested by China.

 Germany has confirmed seven cases of the virus and has advised against nonessential travel to China.",,/r/europe/comments/ex9v8s/coronavirus_german_evacuation_flight_lands_in/fg6y9wl/,ps4Firt,1580579673

&amp;#x200B;

Now some further considerations on italian politics (I can't really find many articles in english so if you don't know italian you'll have to trust me, I didn't want to talk about stuff with no sources)

[Back in 2016 his opinion was quite different](https://twitter.com/matteosalvinimi/status/746422505892544514) (FREE! Now it's our turn!) as he praised the Brexit referendum and hoped something similar would happen in Italy and the other populist party (M5S) was for a referendum on the Euro, but when M5S has been in power in the last couple of years (both in the previous League+M5S and in the current PD+M5S government) they didn't talk about it and the **M5S appointed president has good relations with most European leaders and the EU** and [he feels very comfortable with the Euro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDhP6TIJpE&amp;t=1m10s), he sees it as the currency of his grandchildrens

(*for the ones who don't know recent italian politics from June 2018 to August 2019 there was a government lead by Giuseppe Conte supported by Lega (far-right anti-immigration eurosceptics) and M5S (anti-establishment populists, some say left-wing). Since September 2019 there's a new government supported by M5S and PD (center-left) but lead by the same president*)

While Salvini changed his view to ""let's improve the EU from the inside"" and it seems like he's trying to avoid the discussion about Itexit or whatever lately, I'm not really sure his supporters agree, at least judging by the comments on socials

In the past he also made a distinction between the EU and the Euro as a currency and in a [recent interview](https://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2019/10/15/video/salvini-manda-in-crisi-borghi-e-bagnai-sull-italexit-280631/) he said that **Italy abandoning Euro on its own wouldn't make any sense** but if there will be discussions about changes in the EU monetary policy in the future he will be available, after in a [previous interview](https://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2019/10/14/news/prove-di-salvini-2-0-280232/) **he said that Euro is irreversible** and he didn't want to get rid of it. He **corrected it by saying that the only irreversible thing in this world is death**, and he still thinks that the Euro didn't help Italy's economy at all so far, but that's what Italy is using so they have to work with what they have now

It seems like he's moving to slightly more moderate positions on the subject for now, although some sceptics may remember that the League plan to get rid of the Euro was to do it undercover, not talking about it, and then getting rid of it in the weekend or whatever when the stock market, banks or whatever are closed, although I don't think they would really be that crazy, and considering how much it took the UK to just leave the EU I don't think that Italy could get rid of the Euro overnight

&amp;#x200B;

The **other italian nationalist far-right party FDI** (Brothers of Italy, I know it may sound silly to non-italians but it's a phrase taken from the italian national anthem, it's probably meant to be patriotic) has **grown a lot last year** (from 3% to 11% in the polls, confirmed by the 9-10% they took in the last regional elections) and according to multiple [italian newspapers](https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/times-giorgia-meloni-i-20-personaggi-che-potrebbero-plasmare-mondo-ACXoWT9) its leader (Giorgia Meloni) is considered one of the 20 people who may change the world in 2020 by the Times (I can't see the Times article as it seems like it's behind a paywall but some major italian newspapers covered the news so I don't think it's fake news or something). Changing the world is exaggerated imo, but **she will likely be quite important in italian politics from now on**

I'm not really sure about their exact stance on the EU, FDI is a eurosceptic party and they keet attacking EU institutions and stuff, but I don't know if they talked about Itexit or similar stuff. They're currently in the ECR group (European Conservatives and Reformists), which is about reforming the EU rather than abandoning it

It seems like she's favored among american conservatives as a key far-right figure in Italy as she [participated to the CPAC 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QgpqCfBg2E) (Conservative Political Action Conference) in the USA and she will be at the CPAC 2020 as well, and she will also attend a meeting in Washington Trump will take part in next week, while Salvini was not invited. According to [some articles](https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/generale/2019/11/27/news/fdi_meloni_va_alla_casa_bianca_trump_punta_su_giorgia_e_salvini_ora_la_teme-242074556/) **Salvini is not favored by American conservatives due to its pro-Putin positions** and also due to a scandal about Lega receiving funds from Russians

&amp;#x200B;

In my personal opinion I think that FDI could potentially take the place of Lega as the main far-right italian nationalist party in the long run, either because it will keep growing or because Lega will rethink some of their extreme positions. An advantage of FDI is that it was born as a nationalist party from the ground up while Lega was born as an anti-South North-independence party and just recently became an italian nationalist party, so lots of people in the South still don't trust them (Salvini himself was recorded singing a known north italian stadium chant against people from Naples in 2009). It's hard to tell what will happen exactly though, for now Lega is still way bigger (30%+)",,/r/europe/comments/ex6ax8/salvini_on_brexit_leader_of_the_current_italian/fg6dimg/,Junkererer,1580564683

&gt;The Yangju highway incident, also known as the Yangju training accident or Highway 56 Accident, occurred on June 13, 2002, in Yangju, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. **A United States Army armored vehicle-launched bridge**, returning to base in Uijeongbu on a public road after training maneuvers in the countryside, **struck and killed two 14-year-old South Korean schoolgirls**, Shin Hyo-sun (Korean: 신효순) and Shim Mi-seon (Korean: 심미선).

&gt;The American soldiers involved were found **not guilty** of negligent homicide in the court martial, further inflaming anti-American sentiment in South Korea and sparking a series of candlelight vigil protests in protest of their wrongful deaths. The memory of the two schoolgirls is commemorated annually in South Korea.[1]

Among the dead were men, women, children and elderly people, who were shot multiple times at close range while unarmed.**

&gt;By June 17, 2008, six defendants had their cases **dropped and a seventh found not guilty.**[6] The exception was former Staff Sergeant, now-Private Frank Wuterich. On October 3, 2007, the Article 32 hearing investigating officer recommended that Wuterich be tried for negligent homicide in the deaths of two women and five children, and **that charges of murder be dropped**.[7] Further charges of assault and manslaughter were ultimately dropped, and Wuterich was convicted of a single count of negligent dereliction of duty on January 24, 2012.[8][9] Wuterich received a rank reduction and pay cut but avoided jail time.[10][11] Iraqis expressed disbelief and voiced outrage after the six-year US military prosecution ended with none of the Marines sentenced to incarceration

1241,"&gt; In March 1999, the jury acquitted Ashby, outraging the Italian public.[6] The manslaughter charges against Schweitzer were then dropped.

There was more, but it does not fit your narrative so you decided to left it out:

&gt; Ashby and Schweitzer were court-martialed a second time for obstruction of justice and conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, because they had destroyed a videotape[7] recorded from the plane on the day of the crash. The existence and destruction of this videotape only came to the attention of military investigators in August 1998, once Captain Chandler P. Seagraves received testimonial immunity and elected to disclose ""the truth about everything.""[8]

&gt; Ashby and Schweitzer were found guilty in May 1999; both were dismissed from the service and Ashby received a six-month prison term. He was released after four and a half months for good behavior. Schweitzer made a plea agreement that came to full light after the military jury deliberated upon sentencing. His agreement prevented him from serving any prison time, but it did not prevent him from receiving a dismissal.[9]

&gt; In their appeal, Ashby and Schweitzer asked for a re-examination of their trial and for clemency, challenging their dismissals in order to be eligible for military benefits. They claimed that during the first trial the prosecution and the defense secretly agreed to drop the involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide charges, but to keep the obstruction of justice charge, in order to satisfy the requests coming from Italy. The appeal of Schweitzer was denied in November 2007.[10] Decisions from the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces were made available in August 2009.

And the second part:

&gt; In the months following the incident, both the U.S. military and the South Korean government took actions to attempt to address the circumstances seen as having led to the deaths of the two schoolgirls. As of August 2002, the U.S. Army banned all armored vehicles of the type involved in the June 13th accident from civilian roads. In addition, the U.S. Army announced more than 20 additional measures to improve safety during training exercises, including improvements to the notification system used to communicate with community leaders about upcoming training exercises, the installation of additional mirrors on U.S. Army vehicles to improve driver visibility, and the retrofitting of additional intercom systems on U.S. military vehicles to allow for direct communication between drivers and vehicle commanders.",Western Ukraine,/r/europe/comments/ex2ib0/us_army_begins_to_move_armor_and_vehicles_to/fg67dac/,Nick_N,1580557383

1270,"You keep contradicting yourself over and over again every time you answer, so it’s hard to keep track of what you mean. You won’t define sámi people but you still define them as non-indigenous. You don’t feel Swedish but you get annoyed when swedes don’t speak Swedish to you because you’re Swedish. You say you gave sources but your sources don’t say what you think they say and what you want to say. No one is saying that the Maglemosian or the Ahrenburgian cultures were the ancestors of the Skåne people as you seemed to claim. In fact some of the oldest archeological finds from which DNA was extracted in Sweden showed the haplogroup U5 which is the most typical sámi haplogroup. 

My point about sámi people connecting culturally with other indigenous people is the following and it’s really simple: this is a culture-wide in Sápmi, it is VERY apparent that they see themselves in other indigenous people and other indigenous people see themselves. That is because they are indigenous and other indigenous people recognise that. And that is something that lacks entirely in Skåne.
It’s not a definition, it’s just a very obvious and ubiquitous cultural trait common to them and other indigenous people. No one calls them Indians by the way, unless they come from India.



As for the perks of Girjas, if you knew even one sámi person or follower even one sámi person on social media you would see that it is seen as a huge victory that the state chose to side with indigenous people for once. People are happy and excited and have been celebrating all the while forming Facebook groups to report the violence and the hate and the racism that’s exploded everywhere as a result of that. 



I won’t engage you again because you obviously have an extremely warped view of this whole issue. Seems you are super damn touchy about Skåne not being indigenous and it makes it really hard to talk to you. 
It is extremely disingenuous to equate your struggle and history with that of the sámi people. I find it both absurd and sort of disgusting.",,/r/europe/comments/esrbdq/sami_village_beats_swedish_government_in_court_to/fg67gzd/,empetrum,1580557530

&gt; People like you get on my nerves,that think anyone that isn't PSD is somehow magically correct,good and capable.THEY ARE NOT!!

I never said they are. Besides Iohannis I don't like PNL. I'm an USR-PLUS supporter.


But saying that the healthcare plan is worse than pushing the country's economy towards the same fate as Greece (and since we don't have the Euro is gonna be worse since I don't believe the Troika will come to save us like they did with Greece, Cyprus, Ireland and Spain).



&gt; First of all. Just because it's PSD doing the motion doesn't mean that PSD will come back to rulling. It Means that the idiot that is Ludovic Orban will hit the road.His cabinet may be as well. It will be to the Pres. to appoint another from wherever even PNL again.





Don't forget that Orban is still the boss. So even if his cabinet is ousted and replaced by another PNL cabinet it will be the same thing.


Also even if PSD and PNL don't come back to ruling it will still be bad.


Alternatives are USR-PLUS (which I doubt will get a cabinet), UDMR (which will never come to rulling and will be just PSD but Hungarian), ALDE (Which is like a more corrupt PNL and is already weak),  PRO-România (which is PSD 2.0) and PMP (which are almost as corrupt as ALDE and have been shown to be pretty Far Right).",Wallachia,/r/europe/comments/ewmiop/romanias_social_democrats_file_noconfidence/fg67iv0/,SSD-BalkanWarrior,1580557604

But tariff trading is obviously fundamentally against the concept of the inner market as I'm sure you know, and the UK currently has made a brexit deal which keeps them as a member of the inner market and under the regulations put in place by the EU

The EU trades plenty with other countries outside the Schengen area, but in that case it of course includes tariffs. I must admit that I don't actually know if the Schengen was a specific requirement for the EU to allow Switzerland into the inner market, or if this was a mutual agreement, and Switzerland wanted to be part of the Schengen area. The schengen agreement do offer some advantages when it comes to trading, since it naturally makes trading between European nations faster and with less bureaucracy.

Turkey isn't a member of the single market and never was. The only non-eu members part of the inner market so far is Norway and Switzerland. I do not know the specifics of the current EU-Turkish trade-agreement, but tariffs are very much in effect at the moment.

And yes regulations apply domestically for all members of the single market. The point the EU claims to be of the inner market when it comes to trade-deal negotiations is to have a uniform point of reference on what type and quality of goods the nations outside of EU can expect to buy and sell, and the point of restriction of independent trade-deals is the idea that the EU making deals collectively increases it's bargain power as the collective market is bigger and more powerful.

Hope the format of my comment is easy enough to read. And I hope it comes across, that I'm not trying to make very valued statements or expressing grand political oppinions.

My oppinion so far about the UK deal, is that it feels like a very ""non-brexit brexit deal"".

I think there are two reasons why it's sometimes presented as a separate language: first, to clarify that Alsace belongs to France and not to Germany, especially back in the days when our countries weren't so friendly with each other. Both as a sign to Germany to say ""no, we don't want you to 'liberate' us"", and as a sign to France to not suppress the local language.

1559,"Europe’s desire to utilize central planning and government regulation to replicate creative thought and innovation is truly entertaining.

You can’t mandate innovation. You can only assist by getting out of the way and letting people be free. There is a reason why Europe is lagging behind the US in this area. That reason is overregulation. America doesn’t want  a bunch of drones who obey. We want shakers and movers who make things happen. 

By the time Europe rolls out their own operating systems and hardware, the US will have put into the field the next generation of tech. And through all the red tape, laws, and regulations of the EU, combined with Europe’s desire to pay workers more for working less than their American counterparts, their option will undoubtedly be much more expensive.

Just look at China. Nothing they put into the field is good. They simply steal US tech through corporate espionage snd intellectual property theft, reverse engineer it, and then throw it into the market. Nobody with options desires Chinese products because they are cheap, inefficient, and by the time they are put to Market, the US already is putting out the next thing.

Europe’s option will be much more expensive, and will only fill a niche market of super-expensive products. But with how fast tech moves, good luck keeping up.

I thought this lesson was already learned from the Cold War, where the Soviets were trying to play catch-up the entire time. But for those who don’t have access to historical education, let me put into the record right here and now; YOU CANNOT FORCE INNOVATION BY GOVERNMENT MANDATE.

The concept of a unified Chinese race - [Huaren or Huaxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huaxia) - has existed for literally thousands of years. The overwhelming majority of the dialects you've identified stem from [Middle Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Chinese), all those regions have a shared cultural heritage and commonality, having been a part of the Chinese civilisation and cultural sphere for hundreds of years. The Beijing dialect (Mandarin) has been used as a lingua franca in China since the 18th century. It was chosen to be the basis of 'Standard Chinese' by both the Republic of China AND the CCP *because it was already widely spoken* by the time of the Revolution. Nowadays, every region still has it's own dialect, and it's really only starting to fade with this current generation, NOT as a result of the authoritarian Communist rule. It's happening to all of the Sinosphere, not just China.

By the time of the Xinhai revolution in 1911 - predating Communist rule by about 40 years - the Republic of China proclaimed the policy of ""[Five Races Under One Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Races_Under_One_Union)"".

The older generation are not just uncomfortable with a powerful Germany, what they are uncomfortable with, and rightly so, is being tied into liberal structures such as the European Union, which prevent the UK from pursuing an independent, realist, foreign policy. 

Our Foreign Policy gets jeopardised by tinpot countries like Sweden who offer very little in terms of defence capabilities, but make huge demands on the EU for instance to censor China over Human Rights, or limit the influx of US goods and products that do not meet their standards. Being in the EU forced the UK to go along with their 'liberal foreign policy' nonsense even if it isn't in our interests. 

I don't want to be told that we have to 'support European industry' , for example by buying overpriced French steel so that their feckless unionised workforce can get paid more than people here, I want to buy cheap shit from China, and I don't care if they are dumping it, because we don't have a mass market steel industry for example. 

I just don't give a shit about the EU's regulations, I want to be able to buy an  incandescent lightbulb, or electronics made in a sweatshop in China, or a 2000 watt vacuum cleaner. Consumers should have the right to make an informed decision instead of being told that they can't buy things because of some shitty regulation. 

I'm 22 and have no intention whatsoever of working in Europe, if I ever did end up working abroad it would be in either the USA or China, I don't want to be tied into the EU's protectionism.

1696,"&gt; So I'm not wrong. The UK can trade with the single market without the restrictions you suggested.

Trading with the single market is quite different from being a member of the single market. Your previous comments was concerned about membership, but was that a misunderstanding?

&gt; I don't think the UK wants to be part of Schengen. And I see no reason why being a part of the common market requires that.

No the UK doesn't want to be a part of Schengen and they've never wanted to. That is the impasse the negotiations of brexit has had for these years. The EU have been prepared to give UK the same deals Norway, Switzerland and Canada has, but the first two were too much alligned with the EU and the last removed them from the single market. 

The current deal the UK has made does restrict them from making independent trade deals, and while Switzerland can make independent trade deals, they are currently in a trade-deal with EU that makes Switzerland follow all EU regulations. So currently there aren't any example of a country who is a member of the single market, who isn't ""forced"" to follow EU regulations. 

I don't know if this makes you wrong (I am really not concerned with making a gotcha here), but it means that while your initital statement of:

""The UK doesn't need to ""follow"" EU regulations per se.""

Might be theoretically true, there's currently no example of a country who is within the single-market who isn't following EU regulations. And the UK has to follow the regulations so long as they are upholding the agreement they made this January.",,/r/europe/comments/evq5bt/brexit_deal_passes_the_european_parliament_621_49/fg5parg/,FncMadeMeDoThis,1580534083

The USA made war impossible by squatting on all of the European countries and forcing them to play nice.  The smothering mother that forces affection from all her children.  They kept the Americans in, the Germans down and the Russians out.  

They also opened their own markets wide to European goods while allowing Europe to protect its own industries from competition.  Free-as-in-beer naval protection for European exports all over the world, when previously convoys and escorts had been required.  Europe kept the money and rebuilt with it.  

The Americans paid the lion's share for NATO.  The Americans pulled the Europeans kicking and screaming past their own leftists to victory in the Cold War, a victory that people said was insane to try to win.  Everyone forgets that the Soviets were winning the Cold War in the 1970s and it was generally accepted that the West's role was to gradually decline.  

Then there's the uncomfortable fact that the EU was a CIA plot from the beginning.  Yup, that's right!  No tinfoil hat here.

&gt;Papers show that it treated some of the EU's 'founding fathers' as hired hands, and actively prevented them finding alternative funding that would have broken reliance on Washington.

1913,"Yes there is. E.g. highly educated labour is cheaper. Infrastructure is good. IDK what are these rules and regulations, surely not much of a problem what comes to innovation. Rules ans regulations generally lack behind innovation. If there is rules and regulations already on what you do it surely can't be a very novel innovation, lol. Lawmakers are also eager to make exceptions if something very profitable and harmless has been banned accidentally.

Ease of making business varies but in the most successful EU countries it is on par or even higher compared to States.

You can also still make and use that 10x more efficient charger as long as it also has the universal charger functionality but I'm starting to figure out you're not the most innovative guy out there. Rules are just one source of innovation, actually.

The problem I see is lack of capital. Corporate tax rate in many EU countries isn't too bad. Therefore I suspect Europeans probably aren't just as much business oriented. Innovation itself can be fun but making money is a different game.

Europe is also a much more fragmented market with linguistic and cultural boundaries. Much more effort should be put on intra-EU business communication and trading. Some problems also rise from stupid national proudness arising from the memoirs of the days of glory and imperialism. Old established countries might overlook e.g. the potential od Eastern Europe. It's snobbery and laziness, nothing more.

The only way to validate a popular referendum would be to have it EU-wide, but in that case it would no longer be a purely Swiss matter either. Switzerland would actually be granted *more* influence under the Council system as that one doesn't count votes per head, like a referendum would.

That said, whilst I am skeptical on referendums for everything, I have to admit I'd like to see them on some issues. At least there's [Citizens' Initiatives](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/149/european-citizens-initiative), though this still goes through the filter of Commission expertise (which I'm not sure is a bad thing, given the effects of populism).

1958,"When Tesla came out with their supercharger, it was premium, others have only caught up many years later and lost market share because of it. Tesla’s big thing when they launched was their supercharger network. If they were bugged by laws and standard it probably wouldn’t have existed. Lighting port was vastly superior to micro usb as well when it came out as well. If Apple was required by law to use usb, lightening and its influence on usb c would’ve never existed. 

Manufacturers should be free to use whatever they want, they don’t need to each make their own port, they can come tougher and make a standard if they want, and that’s what usb is and it works for many, but they also should be free to make whatever they want. Manufacturers being free led to lighting port, or the supercharger. Forcing them by law to adopt a single thing would’ve prevented them for doing so, and also destroys all motivation and incentives to ever invest and innovate in the field.


&gt;	But also let me ask you this: Every power plug in your house fits into any wall socket. Why? And is that a good thing?

First of all it doesn’t, we have three pronged grounded cables and two pronged ones. We also have 240v outlets and 110v. Plugs don’t work universally across all these ports. Because they are for different use cases. The we have standards across different countries. There’s like 7 different plug types. There are special safety plugs that don’t work with certain plugs. I could go on. 


Nevertheless, the plug comparison is irrelevant. Plugs are standardized because 1. Bad plugs are dangerous and kill people and cause fires. You feeling a little annoyed that your phone needs a special cable doesn’t kill anyone 2. Plugs are part of a house, a product built my thousands of different builders, they are not mass produced, and so proprietary technology is both pointless and basically impossible.

Finally, power plugs all being the same is not a good nor a bad thing, it’s an indicator that technology has matured. They are extremely simple old devices. You can compare them to extremely complicated, recent innovations that evolve as needs change. Power plugs are no longer evolving,  nor our power delivery requirements. The fact that only one basic plug exists in your house is an indicator that there is no more room for improvement. However just looking at all the many different ports on devices, it’s clear that we are far from that point.",,/r/europe/comments/ewkyd1/european_parliament_has_voted_in_favour_of_a/fg4o0nl/,THICC_DICC_PRICC,1580507306

It's the ""Apple got rid of the headphone jack"" problem on steroids. How many products do we all own that interface with our phones in some way using an external port?

My parents purchased a new car last year. It is the first car anyone in our family has owned that has support for Android Auto/Apple Carplay, which they actually use a lot and really like. But that support is all USB-based. It will probably be another 10-15 years before they need to replace this car, and I agree that the transition to wireless connections will likely happen within that timespan. A big question will be how all these peripherals are able to work with our phones as they make that move--less of a big deal with say a speaker system that likely already has bluetooth support, but when you consider how many random devices we have acquired over the years that interface with our phones in some way?

&gt;The deputies represent the nation. It remains that their election is local. If you dont feel represented in the assembly it is because your ideas are so shitty, voter would rather ally to macron each time than giving a representative seat.

UDMR are pretty radical, it's a party constantly in the parliament that are always accusing romanians of racism and pushing for independence in the area. They also negociated and obtained the leadership of the National Council of Anti-Discrimination (CNAD) which now has to analyze the situation. 

So, while Romania is known to be kind of racist (and let's face facts we have real work to do in this regards), this is actually funny to look at since it's the party that leads our anti-discrimination efforts and yelling how discriminated people in that exact area are... Actually those are exactly the people that keep them in parliament.

2062,"&gt; There is a single authority on ports in the world, USB-IF.

And?  What if I want to build a phone that doesn't use USB at all?

And why, if there are already organizations that have taken on the task of establishing common standards, do we need the EU to step in and start mucking about with these standards?

The fact is that when a company wants to create a new standard, they create an organization that is responsible for creating and maintaining that standard, and they incorporate all the relevant stakeholders.  Sometimes that involves competitors.  Sometimes it only involves the company and its vendors.  

&gt; When a company comes up with a new feature, they don’t make their own port for it because that would be stupid.

It might be stupid, if one of their primary goals is interoperability with other devices.  But maybe they place a higher value on some other feature, in which case losing interoperability might be worthwhile.

&gt; Although each company has their own charging standards vis a vis charging speed, it’s still in their best interest to keep their upper limit within the boundaries of the latest usb cable spec to ensure they don’t fry a phone that isn’t theirs if you try to charge it with their charging brick.

Sure, but why must they be bound to use the latest usb spec?  What if they want to produce a phone with a 5 minute charge time (because that's what some consumers want) and they need to abandon USB in order to accomplish that design goal?  Why should they be constrained by the EU's official standards review process?  Why should they have to wait years longer than they otherwise would to get their new product to market?  

&gt; In the meantime, you don’t need to have a dozen different cables lying around at all times because none of them are cross compatible with more than one of your devices.

The entire idea of the EU *from the beginning* was a complete union.  A United States of Europe, with the constituent nations reduced to the status of provinces.  But learning from the mistakes of the USA, the people's voice was to be removed from important decision-making, putting the experts in charge.  The EU can be guided by the smart people making choices without interference from idiots.  

Then you start joining continental unions together in things like TPP and TTIP, and sooner or later everyone realizes we have a *global governance* going.  No more wars.  Permanently.  Since there are no more nations to go to war.  One government with the entire planet's resources at its disposal.  Wealth can be smoothed out so that the entire planet has an existence that a Pakistani bricklayer would consider acceptable.  For some of you this means a decrease in living standards - boo hoo.  For the vast majority of humanity this means an immense increase.  

And of course a global military that can roam at will to put down rebellions.  No more ""sovereignty"" arguments.  No more Russia obstruction and active measures.  No more populists, no more Trump, no more Orban, no more Poland, no more yellow vests.  Just peace and prosperity, forever.

2396,"&gt; Inside Libya’s detention centers, thousands of refugees and migrants are deprived of food, sunlight, and water, and many become victims of sexual exploitation and assault, forced labor, and even torture or slaying. 

&gt; In January, dozens of migrants and refugees were sold directly to human traffickers from the Souq al-Khamis detention center in Khoms, soon after they were delivered there by the Libyan coast guard.

&gt; The following month, 22 detainees were taken to an underground room and tortured following a protest in the Triq al-Sikka detention center

&gt; [H]undreds of detainees had spent locked up inside a hall without proper ventilation or any tuberculosis medication, meaning those with the disease passed it on to others. 

&gt; Detainees in five detention centers told Foreign Policy they have been forced to assist GNA-associated militias by loading or moving weapons, cleaning military bases on the front lines, and even—in a few cases—fighting with guns.

&gt; In July, at least 53 detainees were killed in the Tajoura detention center, in eastern Tripoli, when a bomb dropped by Haftar’s forces directly hit the hall they were locked in, close to a weapons store.

I disagree. Yes, in the short term the migration flows would soften, but the next major economic crisis to hit the Eurozone (and that is an inevitability I am afraid) will almost certainly come at a time when the ECB has no firepower left (they are already out of ammunition). The bank-sovereign doom loop has not been resolved, there is no lender of last resort and a handful of countries still have inherently unsustainable levels of debt.

2586,"&gt; They didn't develop it for competitive advantage

They pretty much developed USB-C because Apple introduced Lightning. 


Even the chairman of the USBIF basically admitted that. 

&gt; Apple's own Lightning standard and USB-C have a lot in common: The plugs are torsion-proof, transfer different data than USB, tolerate higher currents and voltages than older USB plugs and are also significantly smaller than these. The fact that Apple, despite these similarities, has developed its own connector type as a successor to the 30-pin connector previously used was not a deliberate malice towards the USB-IF (Universal Serial Bus Implementers Forum) standardization forum: ""We were too lazy"" (""We were too lazy""), admitted Brad Saunders, Chairman of the USB-IF, in an interview with c't.   
&gt;    
&gt; As a standardization body, the USB-IF depends on majority decisions of its members for developments. At the time when Apple was looking for a successor for the 30-pin connector, there was not yet a majority for a completely new development, according to Saunders. Instead, the companies gathered in the USB-IF rested on interim solutions such as MHL, which alienated a mini or micro USB socket from its intended purpose.

Brexit will not result in some disastrous crash or immediately obvious decrease in prosperity.

Nor will Brexit deliver some promised land of ""Britannia Unchained"".

The most likely result is 95% of things will continue exactly the same, with economic growth slightly lower than it would otherwise have been. However, other economic levers will be changing too and it will be impossible in the years to come for anyone to say what economic effect Brexit had. 

For example, if there's even a small improvement in productivity growth in the coming years, it's easy to see a future where people endlessly debate whether that was caused by Brexit or whether the Brexiteers just got lucky and if the UK had remained in the EU there would have been even more growth.

You see, no one....not a single person, criticized Erdo because they thought he was literally calling for a genocide against Australians. We're savvy enough to distinguish a dog whistle from a national policy.

The criticism was based on the fact that a head of a large nation felt compelled to articulate and proclaim the self defense of his nation in response to the words of a single disturbed lunatic that represented no-one but himself. Ordinarily, a national leader would find that responding to these random nobodies is beneath their office because the Christchurch shooter posed zero threat to Turkey. Yet, Erdo took the opportunity to somehow give credence to the Christchurch shooter by conflating his actions with that of a nation. 

No one thinks Erdo is stupid, so stop trying to play that angle. He's not stupid. He's sinister....and he takes these opportunities, blows them completely out of proportion as a means of generating any opportunity he can in order to make aggressive proclamations in the international political sphere.

The in-work poverty risk in the EU differs slightly between women and men. In 2018, 9.9% of employed men were at risk of poverty compared to 9.1% of women.

Part-time workers and employees on temporary contracts are more likely to be at risk of in-work poverty than those who work full-time and who have permanent contracts. In 2018, part-time workers in the EU were at twice the risk of monetary poverty (15.7%) than those employed full-time (7.8%), while employees with temporary jobs had almost a three times higher risk (16.2%) than those with permanent jobs (6.1%).

The in-work at-risk-of-poverty rates varied across EU Member States: the highest rates were observed in Romania (15.3%), followed by Luxemburg (13.5%), Spain (12.9%), Italy (12.2%), the United Kingdom (11.3%) and Greece (11.0%), while the lowest rates were recorded in Finland (3.1%), Czechia (3.4%), Ireland (4.9%), Belgium and Croatia (both 5.2%) as well as Denmark (5.4%).

Over the last decade, the share of employed persons at risk of poverty has risen in a majority of Member States.

2856,"Given how hard Washington had been lobbying the UK government against allowing Huawei to have any role in the UK’s 5G network, there was a certain nervousness in Whitehall about the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s visit to London this week. But judging by Pompeo’s appearance with Dominic Raab at Policy Exchange there was no need to worry.

Pompeo declared that the UK/US relationship was in a ‘fantastic place’. He largely pulled his punches on Huawei. He emphasised the US’s view that the ‘Chinese Communist Party is the central threat of our times’ but he implied the US thought the UK’s eventual plan was to move away from Huawei kit. Raab indicated that direction of travel when he said that in future the UK should be looking to replace ‘high risk vendors’ (eg Huawei) with ‘high trust ones’.

On Brexit, Pompeo was bullish. He said he had told Boris Johnson he wanted to be here for Brexit day, but the Prime Minister said the 31st would be a bit busy so why didn’t he come the day before. He predicted that it would bring ‘enormous benefits’ to both the UK and the US. He said the UK had been sent to the front of the line for a trade deal and backed the idea that it could be done before the presidential election this November—a break-neck timetable. He was also keen to stress that he didn’t see a UK deal with the EU as precluding one with the US or vice-versa.

Raab and Pompeo were keen to stress how the UK and the US overall aims were the same, even if they disagreed on tactics as they do over Iran. But what was most striking about this event was how terrorism, which would have dominated the discussion even a few years ago, has fallen down the agenda to be replaced by the more traditional challenge posed by rival states. The US now regards China as the most significant strategic threat and wants its allies to come to the same conclusion.",,/r/europe/comments/ewitwh/mike_pompeo_the_uk_will_be_front_of_the_line_for/fg2hf4g/,casualphilosopher1,1580445058

1. I moved into the UK right as I finished primary school. I've got an all-UK secondary education, A-Levels, a university degree and work history. I spent more of my life in the UK than in Poland at this point.


2. I read, write and think in English. I don't follow Polish news or politics, and I'm not familiar with the Polish bureaucratic systems (whereas I can navigate the English ones as well as the next person). Other than my close family and a few friends, I don't often use the Polish language. I'm basically an alien to the Polish way of life.


3. I have been living with the assumption that I will be able to live, work and retire here freely. This was not an unreasonable assumption at the time. I made choices that will affect me for years/decades to come on that basis, including taking out a student loan and planning to get a mortgage. I invested money, time and energy into making a life here, and none of these are easy to move abroad. 


According to you, I should just up and go to a place that's just a childhood memory to me by now, and is in fact totally alien to me in its mindset and day-to-day culture. I should drop everything that I have worked hard to acquire here, cut loose on all my invested time, money and energy, and just go ""back"" to a place that I'm only linked with by the virtue of having some family living there.

The first link is just US info and isn't really comparable to anything else since each country uses different methodology. Also, if you read the latest CDC report, you'll find that most illnesses were linked to restaurants, suggesting the way the food was prepared was the issue.

If you want to compare foodborne disease data  across the world by subregion using a common methodology, it's better to look at this report (particularly table 4):

2977,"Foreign influx you say? More than 50% of immigration was from outside the EU. Brexit doesn't give you the right to stop that immigration, you already have that right. If immigration was such a big problem, they could have reduced it overnight without the EU being involved. 

That aside, here's my main argument:

I said that Brexit was a personal attack as a joke, but there is some truth to it. Those who voted for Brexit could have been voting this way for economic or sovereignty reasons, but in truth, there was a lot of emphasis put on immigration in the advertising and discussions leading up to the vote. There's a good chance that any given Leave vote was in fact a vote cast against our (EU citizen) presence in this country.

The Brexit vote outcome made me realise that up until then, I was seeing the British society through rose-coloured glasses. 

I thought that the UK is a society that's OK with us EU immigrants, but the truth was that a LOT of people, especially England minus London, seem to have a xenophobic outlook that wasn't really shown very well before in the news. Those people weren't asked for their opinion, so we assumed the populace was as progressive and liberal towards the EU as Westminster kept reassuring us. 

After the results, that changed. It felt like a certain area of discussion was finally ""unlocked"", certain opinions that would be discarded as ""backwards"" and ""niche xenophobic ramblings"" suddenly broke out into the mainstream and even normalised. Like something changed in the atmosphere, that's the closest thing I could compare it to.

All of this suggests that (at worst) we might become political roadkill because some moron decides that he needs to make life more difficult for us to get re-elected by the xenophobic part of the electorate. I don't like that perspective.

Edit: sorry if I'm coming off as a bit aggressive, I really want to keep myself civil here but I don't know if that's how I'm perceived. Obviously we have different perspectives and experiences, so we are likely to come to see the world very differently.",,/r/europe/comments/ev9o6h/we_will_leave_a_light_on_the_greensefa/fg25149/,Corporate_Drone31,1580438374

3046,"Have you lived in the US? Do you know about healthcare costs. Both paying direct and insurance? Very few people can afford European level healthcare in the US. Sure. Poor people will be ruined financially by a routine appendicitis operation. Middle class people will have that in their insurance. However very complex issues, most notably cancer and also many stroke/heart attack consequences (rehabilitation, care etc) are NOT covered by most accept the very expensive insurance programs. And well, sots without insurance are just a joke. So you have to be ultra rich to really afford it all.

Fun fact: a very simple, common yet often life saving test, the EKG. This can be performed of course for free in Europe in public. In private clinics if you want it and the doctors see no need, you can buy it for say $10. The only private hospital in an African country I often go to charges a quite astronomical $50. In the American city where most of my family lives, if you walk in and want an EKG (and have no insurance) it can be an astronomical $300. For a simple test that takes 5 minutes and costs very little. The same is true for more expensive stuff. Just Google how much routine and specialistic procedures can cost in some US States. And compare that to costs of the same operations at private hospitals elsewhere.",,/r/europe/comments/ewe5w3/convince_my_boyfriend_to_move_to_germany_with_me/fg1ji1c/,JoseMikey,1580428230

3059,"&gt; It just strikes me as odd that one member in a so called equal partnership requires permission or authorisation to ask its people for their own opinion, simply because that’s how it’s always been done. 

The political unification was in 1707, and it was already not a very ""equal"" partnership, it was in fact a very cheap way for England to acquire what remained of GB without the need for a costly military campaign and years of unrest. 

I would say once you give up your sovereignity, even if to a (very relatively) civilized nation, you are fucked up. 

&gt; Doesn’t seem very equal to me

definitely not equal. And now you will see the cold hard reality that exist beyond the easy courtesy of being  treated as ""home country"" without having any actual sovereignity. 

On the other hand this can serve as a waking up call for many scots who lived under this fantasy of ""but we are in a union we are equal partners"" but it will also require some deep changes into the political and social landscapes of Scotland.

Non-American cinema has had 50 years or so to catch up and it certainly hasn't.

And throwing perfectly edible food into trash somehow doesn't.

&gt;Now companies will include extra costs into those basic products that will fuck up poor people budgets as usual.

How? They did not include literally tossing that very same food into trash into costs of products. And they did that enough often that you could dumpster-dive for food with no problem.

&gt;Because there is no one that regulates phone makers and each of them has to fight off everyone else.

That is not a positive thing. That is how you get shamefully underpaid and overworked workers that are attempting to kill themselves in droves. And exploding batteries. And companies purposefully throttling the cpu power of cell-phones to make users replace phones that are still in great working condition in the name of profit. And, while we are at it, that is how you get phones which are unserviceable to the point that you can not even replace the battery.

Those could then be skilled labour that could be used in Industrial settings, manufacturing, Government, etc. Of course, this will entirely be dependent on the opportunities available to them. Hopefully the investments that your Foreign Minister has been pushing for will help with getting further organizations that may need them. 

My ideal thought would be that they construct Labs, Hospitals, and other important Infrastructure that would facilitate future work for Scientists, IT, Nurses, Physicians, etc. But that is extremely hard for an outsider to speculate on, as it likely involves local economics.

One additional help with this is that supporting Construction also lowers the cost of Construction often, due to the fact that it increases competition in the market and often results in smaller Subcontractors that open shop and work on multiple sites. These are often ran by skilled labourers/craft, which I can imagine could be helpful in more remote/sparsely populated areas.

3245,"They are, but there might be some confusion about what ""automatic"" means in this context.

If you have a degree in the Bologna system, then it is automatically recognized. If you have a degree from a certain list of countries (including, I believe all EU countries), then it is also recognized. The Bologna agreement is supranational, the rest of the list a national decision.

""automatically recognized"" means that you need to go a university or a respective authority of your host country - in Portugal, that's any university for university degrees and DGES for any other degrees and university degrees -, fill out a form, provide several copies of the degrees and other documentation, and after a couple of weeks to months the degree will be recognized. One problem we had in Portugal recently is that they suddenly required the Apostille of the Hague and not everyone had it  (the issuing country was not yet in the apostille program when the degree was issued). Since embassies generally do not provide the Apostille of the Hague, this caused quite some troubles for some people and the regulation was relaxed. People would have literally had to travel to the issuing country to get the apostille stamped onto their degrees. I believe this was intended to keep foreign applications out. The whole degree recognition thing also caused quite a number of foreign postdoc applications to fail in the last call.

I think there is maybe a bit of misunderstanding (also in the other guy's reply citing EU regulations) about how the EU works. In your host country, the law and regulations that count are your host country's laws and regulations. If a process is ""automatic"" according to EU law or is based on a right given by the EU, then your host country must give this to you, once you provide all the necessary documents. If you don't get it, you can complain, which might cause a lengthy process within the EU, which will ultimately cause your host country to change their laws and regulations.

Funny because even Europe who always put you on a pedestal condemned your chimpout and didn't oppose the Turkish operation.
&gt;In Resolution 573, the Council of Europe supported the legality of the first wave of the Turkish invasion that occurred in July 1974, as per Article 4 of the Guarantee Treaty of 1960,[155][156] which allows Turkey, Greece, and the United Kingdom to unilaterally intervene militarily in failure of a multilateral response to crisis in Cyprus.[157] The Court of Appeal in Athens further stated in 1979 that the first wave of the Turkish invasion was legal and that ""The real culprits... are the Greek officers who engineered and staged a coup and prepared the conditions for the invasion"".[158]

&gt; It was 29 October when we started from Vinda and began this death defying journey.  It was Sunday night when we started.  We travelled all though the night – until Monday morning 10:00 when suddenly we heard some kind of whistle and with that all the lights in the ship shut off.  We were in the lower portion of the ship – on the fifth level below the deck.  Immediately we were able to re-gain our senses, the children cried, and the old people merely sighed and the soldiers put on their back (life) vest and life rings around them.  We clearly heard loud explosions from where we were.  We were in the dark for such a long time and I thought that now were would truly be lost.  I took both children onto my lap so that we could die together.  A little while later the lights came back on and we were told that the emergency was over – the journey went on.  We continued on in the ship when the ship suddenly started to heave from side to side and also began to tilt to one side.  At that point Magi Peeter came from above down to our level saying that it is indeed sad to die but there is nothing you can do about it.  It was a terrifying feeling being down below and to live through that while at the same time the ship was on fire.  At 6:00 in the evening we were ordered to start to come up to the deck, but we were warned that we would not be permitted to bring any bags or belongings.

3377,"Due to my family situation (both children are German/Russian, without registration in Germany/German birth certificate) I'm a bit more familiar with the legal situation than the average person (and in some cases even officials).

Another interesting case was the residence card of my wife. A spouse of a EU citizen residing with said spouse in a EU country which is not the spouses home country falls under EU residence regulations, not national ones. Which means, you don't have to go through the residence permit paperwork, but have an automatic right of residence, and just apply for a residence card to document that right of residence.

Which is different from a residence permit card, which you get after an application for residence has been granted (and which can easily be refused). Residence permit cards also may carry restrictions, are time limited, ... - while the residence card for family members of EU citizens grants you rights very close to those of a EU citizen. 

Turns out, it's rare enough that even police and border guards often don't understand what it is, and need an explanation.

(A thanks to the UK, btw. - originally it was common practise to issue those residence cards only in the second EU state you moved to, so after moving you'd initially still have to go through the resident permit process. Just like with many other residence issue the UK decided to be big enough dicks about it to end up getting sued - resulting in a clarification that already the first state is supposed to issue residence cards.

On the contrary, an inefficient market subsidizes opulent living at the cost of regular tenants. This is because while rent in an inefficient housing market is overpriced in terms of rent, the buildings themselves are underpriced or even worthless. So a billionaire can purchase a mansion within city limits disproportionally cheap in such a market.

This is why city planning is so important. Since rent stays similar per m2, the real problem is that the lack of total m2 in the area drives up rent for everybody. By replacing an inefficient 1500m2 building with 2500m2 on the same lot, the overall rent of the area will decrease.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/ew4hbu/berlin_parliament_voted_for_cap_of_rents/fg032qn/,RassyM,1580399133

A quick back of the envelope calculation shows that this amounts to Scotland voting 87% remain. That's not even counting those who didn't even turn up to vote, which was about 1.3 million and equally could have shifted the vote the other way. 

If we are going to treat Scotland like a homogeneous mass with a unified opinion on the EU, quite frankly they should be stuck with it too because as a population they could have could have put another 2.3m votes into the remain pot while taking 1m out of the leave pot, which would have put the referendum at 51.3% remain.",,/r/europe/comments/evqivz/meps_sing_auld_lang_syne_after_approving/fg034cj/,jam11249,1580399161

3438,"&gt; The reason is simple: the profit motive means that there is an inherent logic in keeping housing supply behind demand, because that pushes up the profit margin. Building a lot of affordable housing is bad for developers because A) it is low-margin and thus low profit(if at all) and B) it shifts the market power away from the supplier to the consumer.

The economic illiteracy here is astounding. 

Recall that revenue = price*quantity. There is no logic behind keeping supply behind demand because the most economically efficient point is equilibrium on the AD/AS curve. If you keep supply behind demand, you are creating a price ceiling, which will lead to a lower incentive to build more housing. 

Building affordable housing is actually good for developers because that means increased revenue from people that can actually afford the properties. The AD curve is as important as the AS curve.

You want to know why there are so many shitty apartments for rent nowadays? Because there is no incentive for landlords to maintain it, given that they receive no economic benefit. 

Nationalization of housing is an idealistic but not pragmatic idea. See: Singapore's system of HDBs.

3609,"&gt; Although true, its worth noting that the SNP got less than 50% of the vote in the most recent General Election.

As did the Conservatives; they won 44% of the vote across the UK as a whole, and only 25% of the vote in Scotland.

The SNP only stand in Scotland. There they won 45% of the vote.

It's hard to see how the UK can justify full speed ahead on Brexit on the basis of 44% of the vote - or 25% if you consider Scotland - where the results of Scotland are ignored on 45%.


&gt; As the SNP is the only pro-independance party, its a lot harder to judge how this will go.

The Scottish Greens are also pro-independence, as indeed are 40% of Scottish Labour members.

Scottish Labour won 19% of the vote in Scotland so a significant number of those voters also support independence, despite the party's overall stance (which is set by the UK Labour Party; Scottish Labour are not allowed to have a constitutional position at odds with the UK-wide party).",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/evs3c8/scottish_parliament_votes_to_hold_second/ffzl7zg/,mojojo42,1580384485

3625,"Thanks for a detailed response. As to what particularly bothers me. It's mainly free movement, immigration and the huge amount of funding the EU provides for research, education and the arts. The British government is on its way to eliminate it. As a classical musician specifically, all I can in this country's future is death as they continue to cut A Level subjects and homogenise all students into machines. So it's not just Brexit alone.

As for my values, I've went from being fully accepted as a child to having to encounter racism all over the place now as an adult. Never heard of many countries that have went so backwards. Unlike many European countries with a far right resurgence, it isn't a resurgence in the UK as it is a very new and modern concept driven by misinformation and hatred.

Also the contextual reason that Brexit ever happened (neglect of the lower classes by the government which forced them to make a stupid decision in the name of a statement, which actually worked) really pisses me off. There's plenty of good reasons for Brexit. I've heard of about 2 people that voted for them. Most people that did it, did it to make a stand which you shouldn't really need in a democratic country in 2016.

This isn't a case of running away, it's a case of seeing a lost cause and a dying culture/society. There's plenty of European countries with more culture, more respect, less hatred and of course no first past the Post system because that is constitutional and really ruins the country's hopes of achieving anyhhing in politics regarding the lack of representation for many groups and classes.

I respect your response a lot and will take the advice seriously. I'm not moving purely out of spite. I've fallen out with my own country and its people over a long period of time. I used to think this country accepted me but really it was only immigrants that did which is ironic. The actual ethnically British people have mostly been very unpleasant and made their best attempts to ""get my people out"" so fuck them. I will leave as they wish. I may not be as important as a doctor in numbers but I believe culture is the most important thing for any nation and my loss just means a part of that culture is lost. I wish British people the best of luck and I hope they see through their hatred in the future, but I personally doubt that outcome within my lifetime.",,/r/europe/comments/evq5bt/brexit_deal_passes_the_european_parliament_621_49/ffzlb3l/,Maegordotexe,1580384588

3797,"When Steve Jobs returned to Apple as chief executive in September 1997, the computer maker was valued at $3bn — less than one-tenth the value of German conglomerate Siemens, Europe’s largest industrial group both then and now.

Fast forward two and a half decades, and Apple’s market capitalisation exceeds not only Siemens — at $1.42tn the iPhone maker is worth more than the entire Dax index of Germany’s 30 leading companies.

Valuations of companies have often been used to make misleading comparisons: there is a cottage industry of pundits who have tried to compare the value of large multinationals to the GDP of entire countries. But sometimes, such contrasts can illuminate powerful trends about the state of nations.

The fact that Germany’s 30 largest companies have been overtaken by one single American giant is more than just a statistical quirk — it is a striking example of how Europe’s largest economy risks being left behind by the 21st century tech boom.

“Over the past two years I’ve heard so many German CEOs saying, ‘If we don’t change now, we might go out of business in the next five to 10 years’,” says Simon Thun, chief executive of Interbrand for central and eastern Europe. “So there is this awareness that we could be the next dinosaur.”

The long shadow of Big Tech has fallen on many countries. Apple is also roughly equivalent to the leading Australian stock market index of 200 companies, for example. But Germany is a special case. It is Europe’s engine and the world’s fourth-biggest economy because its brands mastered quality mass production and engineering, the key elements of 20th century industry before software began “eating the world”, as venture capitalist Marc Andreessen once put it.

The Dax 30, established in 1988, is home to a diverse set of world leading companies including carmaker Volkswagen, chemicals company BASF, insurer Allianz, business software provider SAP and logistics group DHL. The index rose 22 per cent in the past 12 months to hit a record high. But Apple’s value has more than doubled in the past 12 months.

The Apple-Dax 30 comparison underscores two of the biggest fears in German boardrooms. First, although profits and exports remain strong, there is a sense of malaise among many German business leaders and politicians that a new industrial era based on software and data is passing them by.

“The big picture story is that we have missed the train on technology — the sector that is dominating the 21st century,” says Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for ING Germany. “The next 20 years will be dominated by ecommerce, the internet of things and artificial intelligence. In all of these things, Germany is running behind.”

Some leading German executives also worry that Silicon Valley tech companies could swallow up significant parts of German industry because of their immense scale.

The risk is that the industries Germany excels at, such as machine building and chemicals, could see the same kind of disruption that ravaged sectors such as music and media, as digital technology overtakes the hardware-oriented, engineering-based model at the heart of what Germany calls its postwar “economic miracle”.


Herbert Diess, Volkswagen chief executive, sees an existential challenge to the traditional auto business from new challengers. “If we continue at our current speed, it is going to be very tough,” he recently told senior managers at VW.

It is a concern shared by Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor. In an interview with the FT this month, she said that software companies were inserting themselves into producer-customer relationships, becoming essential “intermediaries” between businesses and their clients.

German companies, she warned, had missed out on this development and were now at risk of falling behind. “It’s no longer enough to merely sell a product,” she said. “One also needs to develop new products from the data on these products.”

Her fear: that without this expertise, Germany could end up becoming nothing more than an “extended workbench”, a kind of glorified assembly line.

For all the foreboding about declining competitiveness, disaster has not struck Germany’s economy, which continues to punch well above its weight in exports.

In September the Ifo Institute projected that Germany was likely to boast the world’s largest current account surplus — a measure of the flow of goods, services and investments — for the fourth straight year, at an estimated $276bn. Despite a 2.3% annual fall in exports in November, the figures reflect Germany’s huge success in exporting to China, its largest trading partner.

But a key risk is that Germany will be squeezed by both America and China — missing out on the former’s tech boom while facing increased competition as the latter moves up the manufacturing value chain.

Alexis Wichowski, a professor at Columbia University, describes the US tech giants as “net states” — digital non-state actors unrestrained by borders which, in some cases, have more influence than major governments. They have become valuable by forming customer connections that are near constant. iPhone users check their mobiles many times every hour, while the likes of Google and Facebook are scraping data from consumers and profiting from it in ways users struggle to understand.

“Once you purchase a product, that’s sort of the end of the transaction, whereas with net states there’s an ongoing relationship on a daily, even hourly basis — as we upload data or use their service,” Ms Wichowski says.

As Big Tech companies dominate one sector, they have a propensity to stomp on others’ turf: a 20th century success story like BMW builds cars, and not much else, whereas the tech giants are constantly undergoing a series of dizzying transformations.

Apple, for instance, makes luxury phones and computers but it is pushing into multiple new “services” where it can use its heft to undermine the competition. Its credit card has no fees. Its suite of film and TV shows is free for a year to anyone who buys new Apple hardware. Chief executive Tim Cook is so keen to enter new arenas that he has repeatedly said Apple’s “greatest contribution to mankind” will not be in computers or phones but health.

Amazon has expanded from selling books to mastering one-day logistics, producing its own films and pioneering voice assistant devices. Google has pushed from organising internet search to using machine learning to predict floods, tracking whales with bioacoustics and teaching robots with reinforcement learning.

“We are looking at a different kind of entity altogether,” Ms Wichowski says. “Their ambition, their scale, the sector jumping they are doing — we are only beginning to understand the reach of these organisations in our lives.”


German business is particularly alarmed by this prospect. Stefan Oschmann, chief executive of Merck Group, the Dax listed life sciences company best known for a pharmaceuticals business that dates back to 1668, says what he worries about is “the Uberisation of healthcare”, in which technology is leveraged, on-demand, to create medication specific to the individual.

“That will change the entire pharma model,” he says. “And it could end up in a situation where ‘he who owns the data’ for this, is much more powerful than ‘he or she who administers it’, or who has actually made the active compound . . . So it could well be that in the future the Googles become the competitors of the pharmaceutical industry.”

Other successful German groups are worried that American groups will move in. “These companies have the financial firepower to completely change business models and landscapes,” says Jochen Thewes, chief executive of DB Schenker, a global logistics company run by Germany’s public rail operator.

In logistics, big electronic retailers led by Amazon are spending vast sums to do their own fulfilment and transportation, pushing into the core business of DB Schenker with little regard for short-term profit.


“It’s an absolutely cash-burning machine. They are losing an arm and a leg, but they are of course building an unrivalled capability, they are building market share,” Mr Thewes says. Describing Amazon’s free delivery service as addictive, he adds that “they are giving consumers heroin — because once you’re a user you don’t really want to let go of that”.",Italia,/r/europe/comments/ew2zvv/the_apple_effect_germany_fears_being_left_behind/ffzggvo/,JoeFalchetto,1580377870

Korean defence industry is aiming to participate in the Polish “Wilk” (Wolf) new generation main battle tank programme that is to begin in the first half of this year, “Korea Times” reports. The daily notes that the industrial cooperation constitutes an important part of the proposal that has been prepared by Korean company Hyundai Rotem.

According to Korea Times, Hyundai Rotem is willing to seek agreement concerning the development of a new main battle tank. The above concerns a proposal of joint development and manufacturing of “K2 Black Panther class tanks”. Hyundai Rotem representative, told Korea Times that “ The official project bidding is expected to be announced in the first half of this year and we definitely will take part in the process. **The total project is said to be divided into two stages to produce a total of 800 tanks”.** The daily reports that the exact amounts involved are unknown but the newspiece published mentions the sum of **USD 9 billion.**

The Korean media are most probably referring to the “Wilk” new generation MBT programme. Within the framework of this initiative, the Polish MoD is willing to procure a new generation main battle tanks that would replace the T-72M1 and PT-91 Twardy platforms operated by the Polish military now. Formally, the analytical/conceptual efforts related to the Wilk program have begun back in 2017. Wilk programme is one of the priorities defined by the Technical Modernization Plan covering the term until the year 2035. The document has been signed in the autumn last year.

The Polish Ministry of Defence has been emphasizing the fact that it would be driven to establish a broad industrial collaboration with maximum involvement of the domestic industry. The Strategic Defence Review of 2017 document also mentioned development of the new MBT within the context of an international, collaborative undertaking. 

In that context, the **Polish Ministry of Defence made numerous attempts to join the MGCS future European MBT programme and requested to accelerate this project. So far, however, the attempts made have in that direction not been successful. Furthermore, the new generation European MBT is to become operational in 2035 or later,** to become a replacement of the Leopard 2 and Leclerc platforms that have undergone a deep modernization. Meanwhile, Poland needs to replace its post-Soviet vehicles much earlier, as the planned modification of the T-72 platform is only expected to be a gap-filler.

This is why other options are being considered here as well. Hyundai Rotem’s proposal can be found among them, assuming varied options of industrial collaboration and broad cooperation with regards to the K2PL MBT design. **The tank in question is expected to be manufactured in Poland, with major share of work assigned to the PGZ Group. Chief of the General Staff, General Rajmund Andrzejczak, got acquainted with the K2 MBT last year, during his visit to South Korea.**

Most probably, the Wilk programme, assuming that the current and planned structure of the military would be maintained (including establishment of the 18th Mechanized Division) could potentially involve acquisition of 500 or more vehicles. This is the quantity needed to replace the T-72M1 and PT-91 platforms. Along with 250 Leopard 2 MBTs, the Polish Armed Forces would have around 800 tanks at its disposal.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/ew0m8d/korean_industry_interested_in_the_polish_mbt/ffz41gh/,Tartyron,1580363246

Here's a post I sent to someone else who commented on my original comment saying something similar to what you're saying. It's been changed already and I would prefer it if we went back to the original way of representation.

&gt; What a bunch of bullshit. The ""compromise"" we have now is not what the founders put in place due to the Reapportionment Act of 1929, which capped the US House at 435 Reps. The founders gave two senators to each state to give small states power, while the house was supposed to be based on population size, giving the big states power.

https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/31/u-s-population-keeps-growing-but-house-of-representatives-is-same-size-as-in-taft-era/?fbclid=IwAR0e2OCaLRS42JS8VuH-MJJXbE1ZteUNf0ej5_Lgez7dkUPYp1myYW7Zas8

Right now, representatives from California represent far more people than ones from Wyoming. California should have well over a hundred Reps alone if we were following the founders' system.

Furthermore this idea that if we did away with the electoral college, California and New York would run the nation is complete right-wing bullshit used to suppress democracy. California and New York both don't have homogeneous voters. California is about 60-40 Democrat-Republican, and right now, those 40% of Republican voters are fucked over when it comes to the presidency. Same with Democrats in Texas.

If the president was elected by popular vote, no state would have power in the election because state lines wouldn't matter at all. &lt;",,/r/europe/comments/evq5bt/brexit_deal_passes_the_european_parliament_621_49/ffyxw4e/,BillyYank2008,1580357955

The 'economic cost of Brexit will bring the UK crawling back' argument doesn't work, because if enough people cared about that, Boris wouldn't have won.

The EU also isn’t really a democratic union.

They also ignored multiple member nations referendums while ramming through the Lisbon treaty. the only reforms on the way aren’t even in the right direction. It’s looking increasingly likely the EU will establish and army and from their it’s functionally no different than an independent nation.

4513,"I dunno, I think Boris did get a rinsing for his various gaffes during the campaign, including the phone incident.

Corbyn deserved all that negative coverage, he was incompetent and totally devoid of leadership qualities; worse than that he had a habit of surrounding himself with mediocrity and put forward a manifesto with absolutely no credibility.

Now, the Tories also ran a pretty shoddy campaign but they were clearly the lesser of two evils. As a lifelong labour voter I couldn’t bring myself to vote conservative but nor could I throw my lot in with Corbyn.

&gt; After everything we have seen with Brexit, can you really say that and mean it?

Hand on heart, yes. I voted to remain and still think Brexit was the wrong choice but it would be undemocratic not to follow through and I don’t buy the pessimistic fearmongering at all.

I don’t think that the UK has been ideological in this process and, like it or not, has been willing to compromise to move things forward.

For all their rhetoric to the contrary, the EU is clearly determined to turn this process into a punishment affair. It is essential that Brexit can not be viewed as a success and they are resolved to that end, if it makes us all poorer.

What disappoints me the most is that this should have been a monumentally introspective moment for Brussels. This isn’t some minor event, it’s their second largest economy leaving and, more importantly, and essential counterweight to the Franco-German axis that will now dominate the union in an unprecedented way.

All this high minded nonsense about “the UK is just a third country” and the only deal on offer is something akin to what they’ve already given much smaller or less relevant economies is deeply unhelpful. It’s pushing the UK away and making a harder Brexit that much more likely. They aren’t even willing to offer us what was given to Canada or Japan, think about that for a minute.

I know the UK gets criticism for its delusions of grandeur, wanting to have its cake and eat it, blah blah blah, but the reality is that the UK isn’t just another 3rd country, and it’s much, much more important to the European economy than all the other non-EU countries put together.

I’m not suggesting that the EU should give in to every UK demand, that would be unreasonable, but they need to compromise in some areas no matter how distasteful they find it. 

I’ve seen what their opening ‘red lines’ are for the upcoming negotiations and it beggars belief. There is absolutely no way that a UK government can agree to even half of these let alone the whole lot. And these are apparently the areas in which there can be no flexibility, they have another collection of less significant issues where they are willing to make small concessions. 

That is a recipe for disaster; I half expect the UK team to simply walk away at the outset and start planning for no deal, which is in no ones interest.

The EU fully expect that they can play this next stage exactly as they did the first. But Johnson is not May, and the EU won’t have the British Parliament to bail them out.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/evj9ey/scottish_parliament_to_keep_flying_eu_flag_after/ffx83uf/,MyFavouriteAxe,1580319724

4756,"You are addressing a completely different issue, irrelevant with the migrant crisis.

Germany in 2015 accepted 1 million immigrants, almost immediately after that the Balkan route close (my guess is that it was Germany's decision, although there was never an official comment on that) and the number of migrants reaching Germany decreased dramatically.

Let's say that the Balkan route was still open and Germany was still accepting immigrants from Africa and the Greater Middle East at the same rate.

That would only lead to oversaturation. Every system has both a saturation point and a throughput rate. Taking into account that there would be no job positions for all these people and that also the cost of living could not be covered for an indefinite number of immigrants uncontrolled immigration would only lead to failure.

You can't deal with poverty in the same manner as with a refugee crisis. Refugees who seek to escape from death, torture, rapes and imprisonment have a goal that makes quality of life a secondary matter for them. In order to save lives we can compromise with a ""worse"" quality of life and only the covering of basic needs.

But dealing with poverty means that quality of life is the primary goal. Uncontrolled migration that leads to countries with a very high population density can't offer a solution.

There are over 400 million Africans that live under the poverty line (which means with less than a $1,90 per day). Lets say we move all of them to Europe. What would really change with their lives and how could we provide adequate quality of housing, healthcare, education, clothing, sanitation, education etc. for them?

Additionally to Africans there is also a great number of people who live in the Greater Middle East who are equally poor and wish to move to Europe.

The fact is that it unsustainable to move every person who is under the poverty line to the 10 or 20 top countries of the world with the best GDP.",,/r/europe/comments/evjst2/europes_great_migration_illusion_money_that/ffwmps1/,TravellingAroundMan,1580305705

What does it tell about a country were this already was reality and still is an option to become reality again? We talk about fascists who were just a few months ago in the government, making secret plans for the time after the overthrow. And you people are like business as usual. That's next level reactionary. And worse then Germany yes. Because, as for now, the AfD couldn't calim power in no parliament. Still fuck AfD and fuck Germany. 

&gt;You know how coalitions work, right? Two parties of different views come  
 to an agreement where they start to compromise. That's what's   
happening. The Greens are in the government to finally do something   
about climate change and in order to achieve that they have to make some  
 compromises.

I know that parties and politicians will in most cases do anything to cling to power. Being ""green"" and doing (fairly only 'pseudo') green politics doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be progressive too. Greens in Asutria gave up all moral grounds to finally have a share of power themselves.

&gt;But that mentality has died down quite some time ago and nowadays   
everyone is quite well aware of our role in the Third Reich. Nobody,   
except for our dear right-wingers maybe, tries to play down anything

Nothing positive comes from the UK leaving. Despite what this subreddit parrots the UK were not obstructionist, they voted in favour of the vast majority of EU proposals. On the ones they voted against they were never alone and had other country's who felt the same way about the direction the EU was taking in that area. In most cases the UK agreed to support a motion it did not like on the condition it would not be bound by said motion. 

It's not like the EU will converge faster without the UK, the UK was merely the loudest voice against tighter integration, several members aligned themselves with the UK, even Germany often relied on the UK to act as a counterweight to France and poke holes in their more ambitious plans. If anything I think it'll cause more division as other members have to step up and voice their opinion on matters without being able to rely on the UK doing it for them",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/evjxxe/britain_must_accept_eu_standards_if_it_wants_to/ffweupj/,Dr_McKay,1580298343

4853,"&gt;That doesn't apply to all, or even most financial services, only those which require passporting. 

It does apply. Passporting is another thing entirely as banking is even more protected than skilled services in general. It's not a given you can freely trade financial services even within Unions. The EU has ""passporting"" meaning EEA registered financial firms can provide financial services in other EEA memberstates.

The US, for example, doesn't have this. In the US, if you move from California to Texas, your old Californian bank will no longer legally be able to provide all the services you want. So the large all-inclusive banks you're used to in UK and Europe don't really exist over there. 

Obviously this means EU passporting is no longer an option for the UK, since Hard Brexit means it exits the community completely. Operating from London with passporting would have been an option with Soft Brexit as UK would have remained an EEA (Norway) or EFTA (Switzerland) member. I mean, even if the US had passporting it would obviously be a domestic regulation, it's be stupid to assume this means non-US firms could somehow buy passporting without a registering an entity in the US first. Likewise, UK firms can have passporting, but only once they register a firm within EEA.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/evjxxe/britain_must_accept_eu_standards_if_it_wants_to/ffweylf/,RassyM,1580298468

They aren't English political parties, they are national parties that run in every part of the UK (NI aside). Until the rise of the SNP, Scotland was dominated by the Labour party.

5005,"I don't see how what I said here doesn't make sense. Literally none of what you said in your post justifies forcing those who start working earlier to retire at the same age as everyone else.

The reform already screws over people who make a low wage early on and a better wage near retirement by being based on one's whole career rather than the 25 best years. So your claim that being forced to work until you're 64 will increase their pension is already moot. On the contrary, under the old system, people could keep working after their authorized (reasonably low) retirement age and get bonus pension this way. After the reform, if they so much as retire 2 years prior to the equilibrium age - AKA the current legal retirement age - they'll get a stiff cut to their pension, as high as 10%! 10% lower pensions for retiring 2 years before the minimum, when you've been working for 44 years? That's just madness.

Oh, did I mention that people who work manual jobs typically have a lower life expectancy than those who don't? Forcing the same retirement age on everyone ends up giving higher pensions in total to the latter than to the former. Another injustice to add to the pile.

Claiming that this reform will help with retiree poverty is ridiculous. The country after which this reform is modelled, Sweden, *has twice the retiree poverty rate we do*. 

If something as fundamental to civilized societies as redistribution is akin to theft in your eyes, then I suggest you join your libertarian comrades in the US, preferably in a republican state. I hear their life expectancy is lower than developed world average and dropping. Isn't that what you want?

Claiming that both approaches are ""equal"" is completely nonsensical. That's like claiming that billionaire and homeless people are equal because they're both forbidden from sleeping under bridges.

Moving into less tangible things the F-35 has a built in targeting pod (about 2 million dollars) that also functions as a IRST to detect stealthy targets or detect without using its radar at all, speaking of its radar it has about 60% more modules of similar technology (the F-16V's radar is based on technology from the F-35), the F-35 almost certainly has a better radar warning system and electronic warfare suite, the F-35 also has the EODAS which is cameras covering the entire sphere around the jet which locates incoming missiles (including IR missiles that a RWR can't see) as well as friendly and enemy ground and air units, the EODAS also allows the pilot to see though the jet and it can distribute the EODAS and its other sensor information to other systems allowing it to do things like direct a USN missile launched from a destroyer onto a target the ship can't see.

Australia and New Zealand are doing well, they've signed intelligent trade agreements and have a good life level, but their economy is mostly based on exports of minerals or agriculture. You don't really have gold, coal or oil anymore.

And you can't really take the path of the tax haven (= being the assholes of globalization) to have a flourishing finance and big corporations economy like Singapore as the EU and the US won't let that happen.

5080,"It is useful to think of Anti-Air-Warfare in several layers. The ships as it is currently expected will be fitted with two RAM missile launchers and have at least 32 ESSM missiles in a vertical launching system. 

Whereas the RAM missiles cover the immediate surroundings of the ship and can engage within a very low minimum distance, the ESSM missiles have a far greater range and can engage targets further away from the ship, but not more than 100km away, and not very high-flying targets at some distance. This means that the ship will be qualified for AAW layer 2 and have a very good chance of stopping even modern manoeuvring anti-ship missiles on intercept course. However, the weapons' range limitations mean that for example enemy aircraft could come within the ships radars horizon without having to feel threatened, measuring heading and other data. Still, they would not be able to attack the ship at will as you fear.

Finally, and very importantly, there are ""soft kill"" countermeasures readily available and it is to be expected that they will be installed. These do not destroy an incoming missile but try to produce false targets and otherwise attempt to confuse and obfuscate the missile seeker. 

All in all this is a very good self-defence suite. The usage of ESSM even grants the ship the ability to protect other vessels within a radius of let's say 30km or so. This is also about the standard for modern anti-submarine warships, I'd say it's even quite a bit better than the standard.

Depending on what you mean by a ""coordinated attack"", it will not be enough of course. The ship will not be able to reliably destroy incoming ballistic missiles. It will not be able to shoot down satellites nor will there be a good chance of engaging enemy aircraft that keep their distance.",-6 points 9 minutes ago,/r/europe/comments/evcp7w/germany_walks_away_from_25_billion_purchase_of_us/ffw5rv2/,Bojarow,1580285623

Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine’s richest man, has emerged as the buyer of the historic Villa Les Cedres in the south of France.
The sprawling estate on the French Riviera is a “long-term investment”, according to a statement from Akhmetov’s SCM Holdings Limited. Davide Campari-Milano SpA agreed to sell the property last year for 200 million euros, or about $220 million at the time, the company said in August, without naming the buyer.
Akhmetov, who has amassed a $6.1 billion fortune according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, founded System Capital Management JSC, Ukraine’s largest industrial conglomerate. He also owns Shakhtar Donetsk Football Club.
The billionaire’s latest acquisition adds one of France’s most storied properties to a real estate portfolio that includes an apartment in London’s One Hyde Park development opposite the Harrods department store in Knightsbridge. His purchase of Villa Les Cedres was first reported by the Financial Times earlier Monday.

“Real estate is a key business area for investment in Europe and North America along with mining and metals, energy, media and transportation,” the company’s statement said.
Italian distiller Campari acquired the property when it bought the Grand Marnier Group in 2016. It appointed broker Savills to list the villa for 350 million euros the following year.

As an aside, I'm definitely behind what the Gates Foundation is attempting to do with their wealth and don't at all see how it can be considered neoliberalism.

 Bill Gates specifically says he should pay more tax, which should in turn be used to fund government services to help protect the needy and the environment. This includes better environmental and public health regulations.

5196,"Wind and hydro power each contributed around one third of the total electricity from renewable sources in 2018, with wind power (36%) edging hydro power (33%) as the most important sources. The remaining one third was generated from solar power (12%), solid biofuels (10%) and other renewable sources (9%).

The growth in electricity generated from renewable energy sources largely reflects an increase in particular of wind power, but also solar power and solid biofuels (including renewable wastes), while the amount of electricity generated from hydro power was relatively similar to the level recorded ten years earlier.

Among Member States, more than half of the electricity consumed in 2018 was generated from renewable sources in Austria (73%), Sweden (66%), Denmark (62%), Latvia (53%) and Portugal (52%). The high shares of renewables in generation of electricity in Austria and Sweden is principally caused by hydro power, which produces more than three quarters (77%) of the electricity consumed in Austria and more than two thirds (69%) in Sweden.

In contrast, less than 10 % of the electricity came from renewable sources in Hungary and Malta (both 8%) and in Cyprus and Luxembourg (both 9%)",Romania,/r/europe/comments/evj7dx/wind_and_water_provide_most_renewable_electricity/ffw16yk/,filosoful,1580280045

Note that if you start working early you also contribute less at the beginning, and more at the end (since your salary in theory increases as you get more experience and get promoted) thus by working eg 18 to 58 years old you run the risk of having very low retirement since the majority of your most beneficial years are not taken into account. This age pivot will help with the poverty of retirées, something that is actually happening in Germany (their rate of old people in poverty is double that of France). Of course you can just say screw it and continue with the redistribution, but that is just another way of saying “I want your money”.

* even if you don't die, the virus could leave you with permanent health issues. Again, SARS left many people with permanent health problems.
* there are potentially yet unknown effects on other parts of the body. In a small percentage of patients, SARS also infected brain tissue causing nervous system damage.

&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) today estimated the overall fatality rate for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) patients at 14% to 15%, significantly higher than previous estimates. The agency estimated the rate for people older than 64 years to be more than 50%. \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;In the early stages of the SARS epidemic, health officials estimated the mortality rate at less than 4%. More recently, officials have cited rates in the 6% to 7% range. Today's SARS figures from the WHO—6,903 cumulative cases and 495 deaths—point to a case-fatality ratio of 7.2%. But WHO officials note that this calculation underestimates the rate, since some currently ill patients will die of the disease.

5290,"Nope, your wishes are irrelevant, your orders ludicrous.

 The problem is on your regulations side, you basically exclude drones from use in your airspace. Regulations will change magically when you’ll have German “Eurodrone” ready to sell.  Using safety concerns is oldest truck in a book. Why do you make the whole dance? To not look openly as prejudiced callous assholes. You regularly regulate everything in a way that excludes any competition.

&gt; Manned aircraft like the envisioned Global 6000 are allowed to routinely fly alongside civilian traffic, a prospect that the Germans see as more palatable than dealing with drone-specific airspace corridors.

...

&gt; Letting drones fly in the same airspace as civilian traffic remains an unresolved problem, as the requisite sensing technology and the regulatory framework are still emerging. Germany previously tried filling its signals-intelligence gap with the Euro Hawk, but the project tanked in 2013 after spending $700 million because officials underestimated the trickiness of attaining airworthiness qualification.

...
&gt; With the Triton gone, Germany’s next ambition for a fully approved unmanned aircraft lies with the so-called Eurodrone, a cooperation with France. Officials have said that the program is designed from the start with manned-unmanned airspace integration in mind.

* They don't put the U.S. (or its states) on the same charts as the EU (or its nations).

* The vertical axes are not labeled, so it is not possible to tell what the units are.

* For several pollutants, the units differ between the U.S. charts and the EU charts, which makes it impossible to make apples-to-apples comparisons.

* Except for CO, the pollutant limits are different between the EU and U.S., which the article ignores (see below).

* The article concludes that ""in the US, only California violated the PM10 standard while in the EU 18 of the 28 states did""; however, the US allowance for PM10 is three times higher than that of the EU! In fact, if the U.S. standard is applied to EU, none of the EU nations exceed the limit.

5428,"A typical stomach bug style food poisoning should have the main symptoms end within 24-48 hours, with the 'main event' lasting less than 12 hours. 

If they continue after that, or if you personally consider your symptoms to be 'severe' (you can't keep down even sips of water after 12 hours passes, or you have other symptoms such as dehydration) then you call a doctor.

They will then tell you if you need to be seen or if you should wait based on your description over the phone.

Theres no harm in calling your country's non-emergency number (111 in the UK), and asking advice, but they will likely tell you the same. 

There's nothing more they can do for you, if you're unable to keep down sips of water, then they may recommend you go in to have a drip to prevent dehydration.

When there is less than 50 cases of salmonella per year the chances of it being that, and not a typical stomach bug that will pass is incredibly low.

Even if it is salmonella, the vast majority of cases don't require treatment other than rehydration and it will pass on its own like any other bug. 

It is a tiny percentage, of a tiny percentage of a tiny percentage of people with symptoms that will need anything more than water and waiting.

Though in the past some countries have been overzealous with giving salmonella treatments to people who don't need it, and that's caused an increase in treatment resistant strains.",Community of Madrid (Spain),/r/europe/comments/ev1x24/us_wants_the_eu_to_accept_chemicalwashed_chicken/ffv4ecu/,PostVidoesNotGifs,1580255408

Ok if instead of guiness world records, and the red jungle fowl, we take domesticated chicken, we have a lifespan of 3-5 years.  
If we are talking about chickens that are worth to be slaughtered at 5-7 weeks old. (thats somewhere between 10-20% of the maximum lifespan of the breeds in question)  
And yes, while chickens as a species can interbreed, the lifespan of a given indvidual chicken can be predicted based on its breed - so it we want a honest discussion we need to take that into consideration.

Without the rebate UK and French payments would be very similar. However, the EU spent 13.5 billion Euro in France and only 6.5 billion in the UK, so the net payments would be very different.

Here are the EU spending breakdowns for France and the UK:

UK 3,438

Regional policy

UK 124

**""I'm afraid for the future of our continent""**

Does Kaczyński consider homosexual people as a threat? **Only those that ""question the traditional family model, that is, the coexistence of man and woman.**"" Such a statement was made by a politician in conversation with one of the German tabloids. The PiS leader added that those **who do this pose a danger not only for Poland, but also for the foundations of European civilization.**

&amp;#x200B;

Jarosław Kaczyński, president of Law and Justice, was asked by journalists and journalists of the German tabloid ""Bild"" **about attitude towards homosexuals and why ""he considers them a threat"".**

&amp;#x200B;

The leader of the ruling party stated in reply that **he considers only those homosexuals who challenge the traditional family model to be a threat**. Moreover, in his opinion, such people are dangerous n**ot only for Poland, but also for the entire European civilization**. *""Whoever does this threatens not only Poland or Europe, but also the very foundations of our civilization. If these values ​​are questioned to such an extent, I am afraid for the future of our continent*"" - said the politician.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kaczyński noted that homosexuality has** ***never*** **been punished in Poland**. He added that the exception may be the period of partitions when Poles and Poles had no influence on the law: ""Unlike many other countries, **homosexuality in Poland was** ***never*** **banned or punished** (except during the partitions, when we did not have our own statehood). When we regained independence after World War I, these records disappeared from the penal code, which was a phenomenon in Europe at the time. So, there is no such history, no tradition and no violence against homosexuals. ""

&amp;#x200B;

**However, the president did not refer to the declarations of ""LGBT free zones"" adopted (mainly thanks to the votes of PiS politicians) by several dozen local governments throughout Poland.**",,/r/europe/comments/evc4vd/kaczyński_homosexuals_questioning_the_family_as_a/ffur4v2/,FullWolfMoon45,1580247750

Yes, you’ll get treated for a life threatening condition. And then you’ll receive your cool bill for 100s of thousands of dollars. Your hospitals might be good, your healthcare system is the laughing stock of the entire planet. You have 30mn uninsured people. Nearly 10% of your population. And you defend that joke of a system?

5632,"So one recipe I basically made up myself - the beauty of it is that you  can basically sub out any of the veggies for what you have in the house.

I fucking love this recipe because a) it's super easy, b) it's  quick, c) it's cheap and d) it has a really great balance of flavours.

You get umami from the sausages, cooked tomatoes and pine nuts; you get  sweetness from the carrots, balsamic and honey; you get richness from  the caramelised veggies, garlic and herbs and most importantly, it's  completely vegan (well maybe not the honey if you're super strict, but  you could use maple syrup or just omit it)

**Warm Winter Salad**

Ingredients

\- 1 pack veggie sausages  
\- 2 carrots  
\- 1 onion  
\- 1 tin of green lentils  
\- 2 tablespoons of honey  
\- 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil  
\- 1-2 cloves of garlic  
\- 1-2 tomatoes (or a handful of cherry ones)  
\- pine nuts (I like these but you can use any nut really)  
\- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar  
\- Dried herbs (I use thyme or Italian seasoning)

Stick the sausages on a baking tray and put in the oven as per their cooking instructions. These can be taken out once done.

Roughly chop the carrots and onion and place on another baking tray. Drizzle  with the honey, half of the oil and some of your dried herbs. Mix to  coat them in the honey and oil, season with salt/pepper and put in the  oven for about 30-40 mins until soft and caramelised.

Get a large frying pan to medium heat, add the pine nuts and toast for a couple of minutes. Put to one side.

Add  the remaining oil to the pan and chuck in the garlic and the rest of  your herbs to fry on medium-low heat until fragrant.

Chop up the tomatoes into bite-size chunks or just cut in half if using cherry tomatoes. Add the lentils and tomatoes and stir to combine/soften.  Keep on a low heat while the oven things cook.

Once the oven things are done, take out of the oven, chop the sausages into chunks and add everything to the lentils.

5745,"About 14.7% of the US population suffers from food poisoning every year, compared to 1.5% of the UK population, but food poisoning and Salmonella are obviously 2 very different things.

In the US only 420 deaths a year are attributed to Salmonella by the CDC, which is obviously a miniscule number and seems barely worth mentioning. The thing that makes it an issue is that in the UK the number is 0. [No deaths from Salmonella were recorded in the UK between 2006 and 2015](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/598401/Salmonella_2016_Data.pdf). [The entire EU only recorded \~134 deaths from Salmonella in 2016](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/03/more-than-130-deaths-in-europe-linked-to-salmonella-in-2016/), despite the EU outstripping the US in population by more than 150m people.

Even ignoring deaths (which could easily be due to the US healthcare system being so much worse for the kind of people likely to be eating bad food (the poor)), the US also gets [much more Salmonella infections at 1.35m](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/general/index.html) (around 0.4% of the population), as compared to the EU at 20.4 in 100,000 (around 0.02% of the population).

So yes, the rate of Salmonella infections is miniscule in both the US and the EU. However, the rate in the US is still significantly higher than the rate in the EU, and considering that Salmonella is commonly contracted from eating bad chicken, the fact that the US has lower food standards for chicken seems like a pretty obvious correlation.",,/r/europe/comments/ev1x24/us_wants_the_eu_to_accept_chemicalwashed_chicken/ffu37z5/,Santaire1,1580233524

Because there is more to politics than just an economical spectrum. Therefore the left-right spectrum is a distorting representation of people's opinions.

A one dimensional model is necessarily a simplification, but in this case people did not even choose the axis on which people's opinion differs the most, it seems.

You pay their needs when they are young, but it is an investment because they are your pension insurance. In developed countries with social security, you make payments into the (state or private) pension fund, so you don't ""need"" kids anymore. In fact, you're financially worse of if you get kids.

All the people who choose to not have kids save up more in their retirement fund. But: their retirement fund would be worthless if there was no future generation willing to work for the money. They benefit from all the time and money that parents have put into raising children.

Now if people don't want children, I'm totally fine with that, but I do think it would be fair if parents got more tax cuts or child subsidies than they currently do, incentivise people to get a bit more children, or at least not stop them because they are too poor to support children.

Also as an anectode - CDC still advises us folks to hard boil eggs to avoid salmonella while in Europe we are fine with eating them raw and we don't have massive salmonella outbreaks.

5931,"&gt; here you can see that last argument as ""we may have our bad parts, but we're still better than the other side"". it's good, but it could probably be better, and pointing out the flaws of our better system is a way to get to something better. talking about it and pointing the flaws we have give more credibility to the system, as of course it has flaws somewhere, and gives the opportunity to think about why those flaws exist, and give ideas for potential ways to fix the issues. somewhere for example proposed having a good execution to accompany the laws, in the ways of people checking that companies are following the regulations, and give sanctions, or some other thing when the regulations are not followed.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; so I agree whole heartdly on the idea that arguments that serve to diminish discussion about things don't really have a place in this kinds of discussions, but I'd fight those arguments with ones that invite discussion. ""it's not perfect, but it's better than the alternative"" can sound like ""it's not perfect, but it's good enough"". I don't think that's what you meant though, and I think you probably meant ""it's not perfect, but our system has value, actual value, and more value than the alternative.""

Yeah I more or less agree with what you say here, however this kind of discussion becomes a matter of opportunity and of impact of the original message.

For example, I'm interested in your post as I introduced the argument, but if I were to find such a long post ""in the wild"", I'd probably skip it and ignore it. Whereas my post was short and meant to highlight the specific fact while, admittedly, ignoring the issues that might be there.

However in general I'd say that my kind of response was also more ""on point"", as it outlined the issue in the ""what we're doing vs what they're doing"" perspective. And in that context, even considering all the issues and pitfalls our regulations and controls might have, I don't feel there's really any gray area, at least as far as consumer safety is concerned.

This, again, doesn't mean the system is perfect, but that's yet another discussion, one that could possibly obscure the fact that the system is ALREADY better than it could be.
