1,"Again, it wasn't their land any more than Lebanese land is Syrian land. Tel.Aviv was a.new Jewish city on an empty sand dunes - why would that 'belong to Palestinians'?

The British Manadyate shaped state was, again, very new and in reality Jordan etc had been part of the Ottoman province for hundreds of years. Saying the Palestinians couldn't have compromised because this artificial shaped British construct was all theirs defies history.


&gt;They should be able to, but it's not something Palestinians did. I'm sure you can also point out Spain forcing out Sephardic Jews, which was tragic but not doing of Palestinians.

You can't separate out the larger Arab world.from the conflict. If you read the history you'll know how the Palestinians and Arab states worked together to try to exterminate Jewish nationalism. Palestinians were in Damascus and Cairo taking part in summits and meetings formulating plans to block Jewish nationalism and later for war. The Arab states promised Palestinians their support which is part of what made them aggressive to launch the Civil War - they thought they had insurance and couldn't lose since even if they failed the Arab armies would save them.

Then when the Arab armies themselves failed the local Jewish populations in their countries became targets to be scapegoat for the failure of the whole Arab community.

The Jewish people who were expelled from the Arab world by and large came to Israel, where they faced rough times and discrimination, but ultimately settled in and integrated.

The Arab states though keep Palestinians in refugee camps.to this day, prevent them from holding jobs and participating in government, solely so they can remain as a political tool and.weapon for.people like you to say they should go back to Israel.  But refugee by descent is specifically not practiced for other conflicts as everyone realizes it's cruel to the refugees and prolongs the conflict

But everywhere else in the world (from Africa to Asia) considers this practice cruel and not in the interests of humanity. Israel obviously benefited from the influx of Arab Jews, but they could have been monsters and keep them in camps.as a political weapon, but that would be inhumane 

But that's what the Arabs do with the Palestinians, pass down their refugee status to their kids (something not applied to other conflicts!) to keep the conflict alive for 70 years.",Yup,/r/europe/comments/bnmuv5/german_foreign_minister_condemns_uns_treatment_of/eneupjj/,the_raucous_one,1557804970
2,"When Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state, last week abruptly cancelled a meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel, the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper declared that the US-German friendship was “in ruins”.

Washington said Mr Pompeo had to fly to Iraq for a pressing Iran issue. But the cancellation of the meeting with Ms Merkel, who has faced harsh attacks from President Donald Trump, was another reminder of how strained relations have become between the US and its European allies.

Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA operative elected to Congress last year, said the “contemptuous” way Mr Trump treated allies had hurt some of the most important US relationships. “When you have a good relationship, world leaders understand that things come up,” she said. “If we were in a circumstance where we were benefiting and working closely with the Germans . . . it would be less of a diplomatic drama.”

Since Mr Trump came to office in 2017, the US and its key European allies — Germany, France and the UK — have diverged over everything from climate change to trade to the Iran nuclear deal.
Critics say Mr Trump is undermining alliances that have underpinned transatlantic security for decades by welcoming authoritarian leaders, such as Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban who visits the White House this week.

“It is not lost on the Europeans that the president goes after the true democratic leaders and has refused to go after the true authoritarian figures,” said Nicholas Burns, a former US ambassador to Nato. “We are seeing a possible US repudiation of what made the alliance viable over 70 years . . . President Trump does not believe that the EU is a valued ally. He believes that the EU is a competitor.”

Beto O’Rourke, a Democratic presidential contender, told the Financial Times that Mr Trump should be strengthening alliances to help deal with joint concerns such as China. “We have a great opportunity to renew those alliances and friendships . . . and also an opportunity to stand up to the strong men, the autocrats, the dictators that dominate so much of the challenges that we face right now,” he said.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bodm9i/us_rift_with_europe_widens_ahead_of_orban_visit/eneupn9/,FriendOfOrder,1557804972

4,"US officials say the president is just trying to ease an unfair burden on the US. Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the EU, said there had been “too much gilding the lily and not enough substance” over the years.

“We’re interested in substance and then resetting certain relationships between us that have gone completely out of balance, instead of coming here and taking nice photos and attending lovely soirées and allowing the underlying issues to fester,” said Mr Sondland. “Good friends and strong allies have serious conversations.”

Constanze Stelzenmüller, a Brookings Institution Europe expert, said US-EU ties had entered a period of “uneasy peace” as Mr Trump has been focused on reaching a trade deal with China — except for Germany.

While Berlin was unhappy with Mr Pompeo last week, the bigger issue is that both sides are miles apart. Mr Trump is exercised about Germany’s huge current account surplus, its level of defence spending, and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline bringing Russian gas into Germany.
“The US would say that there has been no discernible progress on any of these issues, so why even bother to talk,” said Norbert Röttgen, head of the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee. “Trump’s style is that if you don’t give in to America’s demands, he will snub you.”

The US has distanced itself from the multilateral institutions and international agreements that Germany holds dear — a stance reinforced by John Bolton as national security adviser — such as the Paris climate accord.

“Talks with Pompeo in Berlin would not have achieved a breakthrough on any front,” said Ulrich Speck of the German Marshall Fund. “All the dossiers are stuck.”
Germany’s failure to meet its Nato commitment to spend 2 per cent of gross domestic product on the military is a good example. Now Berlin is braced for another setback. There is a growing expectation that Mr Trump will follow through on a threat to impose import tariffs on European cars, which would be a body blow for the German car industry.

Clete Willems, a former senior Trump administration official and incoming partner at law firm Akin Gump, said it was “critical” that the US and EU work together. But he said the US “has serious concerns about the EU’s agricultural market access barriers, regulatory barriers for autos and other products, and taxation policies that harm US technology companies”. 

While some European officials hope Mr Trump will not impose the auto tariffs while he negotiates with China, Mr Sondland warned about complacency. “The president very much intends to use the auto tariffs as a tool if necessary,” he said. “The president has a ‘wait and see’ attitude right now, as these talks resume to see if there is forward progress being made or if Europe continues to drag its feet indefinitely.”

Relations between the US and Germany have also been hurt by highly unusual interventions by the US ambassador to Berlin, Richard Grenell. In March, he warned Germany that the US would scale back intelligence sharing with Germany’s spy agencies unless Berlin blocked Huawei from its 5G network. And in January he wrote to companies involved in Nord Stream 2, warning their activities “carry significant sanctions risk”. Martin Schulz, the former Social Democrat leader, said he was behaving “like an extreme rightwing colonial officer”.

Germany and the US have hit rocky patches before. Gerhard Schröder and George Bush fell out over the US invasion of Iraq, but their administrations stayed in close contact. For Mr Trump and Ms Merkel, that is not the case. At the G7 in Canada last year, Mr Trump threw several pieces of candy on to the table in front of Ms Merkel and then told her she could never claim that he never gave her anything.

“The temperature of the relationship froze as soon as Trump came in, and it has never recovered,” said Mr Speck.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bodm9i/us_rift_with_europe_widens_ahead_of_orban_visit/eneurk0/,FriendOfOrder,1557804995

What is America getting for its money, then?  And if it's not purchasing cooperation, then why keep throwing good money after bad? 

&gt; I was recently in conversation with national security experts from Europe and the United States. I brought up that if the United States had to rush forces to the Eastern European frontier, they would have to pass through military bases in Germany. I asked if the Germans would permit the free passage of U.S. military forces. The answers ranged from “probably” to “I don’t know.” I assume they would, but the idea that the question would even come up and be answered with less than an absolute “of course” indicates a lack of trust in Germany.

Yes. 

Besides what you outlined, the main drain on European defensive capabilities are offensive endeavours. 

The German Navy has become a joke at it's traditional role of coastal defense (locking down the Danish Straits and preventing naval landings in East Germany) because all it's new ships are made for long-term anti-piracy or anti-smuggling missions half a world away.

203,"&gt; In Britain we have the Muslim Council of Britain (I think?), do you not have something similar?

That's precisely the problem: Muslims in Germany have *several* religious organisations (Central Council of Muslims in Germany; DITIB; Islamic Council of Germany; Association of Islamic Culture Centres ...), and thanks to a staggering amount of separatism, sectarianism and infighting, they all compete with each other and can't agree on a single thing, let alone elect a central governing body representing *all* of them.

However, German constitutional law requires that there be such a central organisation representing a confession or denomination (like the Catholic Church or the [Evangelical Church in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Church_in_Germany)) for it to be able to collect a tithe (""church tax""). 

Incidentally - and somewhat ironically - the same constitutional provision would allow the [Humanist Association of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistischer_Verband_Deutschlands), the central organisation representing secularists, atheists and non-affiliated persons in Germany, to collect a ""church tax"" as well, although the organisation chose to not excercise its right (for obvious reasons).",Charlemagnia,/r/europe/comments/bo9c20/germany_mulls_mosque_tax_to_curb_foreign_funding/ene04mb/,ColourFox,1557790648

207,"It is a difficult subject. Very much driven by fear and emotions. While it's an understandable reaction and to a degree very needed - making sure that the most innocent and vulnerable are safe and protected - I'm not sure if the actual result isn't the opposite of what's expected. Mixing child molesters and pedophiles puts even more stigma on the latter. I'm not sure how it would work in the society, especially in one that being gay while more and more acceptable is still something being hidden and reason to be ashamed for years. But I can't imagine having such preferences and telling someone about it - even a doctor. I want to believe that most of those people are good people and don't want to act on their needs. But as long as we're going to use child molesters and pedophiles interchangeably I don't think it's going to help to solve the problem. 
You don't have to make pedophilia more acceptable in any way, because there's a huge difference between it and any other sexual preference/orientation. But I would rather have a willing pedophile at a doctor, preparing a treatment, maybe chemical castration, maybe something different but being treated like a person who's looking for help than that same person hidden somewhere, not having help, being afraid to tell anyone for being treated as a child molester even without doing anything. It's easy being straight, perfectly socially acceptable - so I can't imagine really how it is to live as a person who's attracted to someone you really shouldn't be attracted to. But I want to believe that the same way as I don't go around and rape women because of my preferences, because that would be bad, it's the same for I hope most of pedophiles. The difference is that at the end of the day I can find a way to fulfill my needs without hurting anybody, but they don't. 
I don't know how hard is it to control yourself in that situation - is it possible for most to do that without some kind of drugs? Is it enough to go to some kind of therapy? Or because of uniqueness of this preferences and lack of any other forms of fulfillment that does not break the law those people should be treated pharmacologically for the rest of their lives - just like people with mental issues who may pose a threat to others.
I think that we're not going to know and we won't solve this problem by making sure that even those ""good ones"" can't tell it to anyone and have to repress and hide, instead of seeking for help.
It's hard because I think I would be afraid to leave a child with a person knowing their preferences, even if I would knew that they aren't likely to act on it or that they seek help. But I'm also not sure how much of a short term solution to avoid that person and by extension that problem would that be. How cold and rational that behavior is - to see a rapist in every such person. My logical brain tells me it's better to treat this as a mental disease and start treatment as soon as possible for the benefit of that person and everyone around them than to be afraid of the very existence of such people and in a way make them not seek a treatment out of fear of being rejected, pointed at or sent to jail. That's my logical side. The emotional would still not leave a child with that person.

This is what often seems to be forgotten: votes do not belong to a voter in the Dutch and many other systems so you not casting a vote is completely equivalent to a vote being removed from another that would have cast the same vote that you did instead.

Apart from that the major problem with voting is that it's a prisoner's dilemma that relies on the human instinct to perform slactivism.

It's how our system of government works.  It's served us pretty well as far as modern governments go. It doesn't need to be accepted as ""inherent truth"", but it is the governing ruling that inferior courts and laws must follow.

&gt;That was also a time where a town beating up a local dude who said something most people didn't like was something the police would participate in. 

Ok? What does that have to do with anything?  Beating people up was still illegal, regardless of whether the local police were involved with the beating.  That's not a problem with the law, but the law enforcers not doing their job and I fail to see how more laws would change that.  

&gt;The absurdity to trying to fit our modern problems into last centuries solutions is unfathomable.

On the other hand, a federalist would like to see EU have more powers. The thing is that if EU/Eurozone is going to survive changes are needed. Both Timmermans and Weber identified the veto of head states as a serious problem.

Imo only a more unified EU can be a ""player"" in the international state and a respectable power. I don't think any EU country alone can stand up against China, US, Russia (and India down the road).

298,"&gt;Arhm, your link is a prime example of those windows. Without reinforced concrete it wouldnt be possible to make such long windows without big supporting wall parts splitting them... The fucking roof would just collapse. Before Baushaus it would have been: 40cm windows; 1meter wall; 40cm window; 1meter wall etc. - Now its a long, uninterupted string of glass.

You don't get my point. The amount of glazing in proportion to the wall was not nearly the point in the philosophy of Bauhaus and early modernism, merely one of the solutions. As I have demonstrated, big exterior curtain wall facades are achievable with interior load-bearing steel core. In fact, how the outside really looks became irrelevant to the structural system as early as 1880s. But again it doesn't matter. 

What I mean is primarily the difference between **[this](http://cdn.panoramastreetline.com/uploads/2013/04/Berlin_Landsberger_Allee_Panorama.jpg)** and **[this](http://cdn.panoramastreetline.com/uploads/2015/02/Leipzig_Dittrichring_400.jpg)**. In the former - grid-like, standardized, sterile exterior. In the latter - small scale, detailed, individual facade. What's majority of people do not like about modernism is its stark sterility, and the fact that its too much of it in relation to the less abstract aesthetic styles, and that modernist architects are known to guilt-shame those who think that there maybe might be an alternative to their works.

&gt;Yes, because the city decided to keep the old look. They didnt design ""new oldish-houses"" they just restored damaged ones.

Hit and miss. The *damaged ones* were for the most part destroyed entirely. Most of Prinzipalmarkt has been rebuilt (that is, designed anew) in a regionalist style, arguably one of the best post-war solutions that were not reconstructions. Below are a couple of relative pre-war\post-war views:

I haven't read the book, but this sounds like bad author-logic. The ""cheap and simple"" dark forest attack capability is something they'd innately have just by being able to cross the interstellar void: instead of wasting all those resources building a fleet of ships and an invasion force; they could just as easily just strap those engines to a bunch of planet-cracking asteroids and send them our way. If they'd somehow lack the means of calculating the orbital mechanics involved across that distance, they could just send a smaller force instead, and do the same thing as above only with asteroids/planetoids from our Oort cloud.

That right there is a dangerous statement, given that any criticism of muslims/africans/gays/other minorities is now branded as oppression by many of the left. It's not difficult for them to make up a (false) argument saying that if I say ""I find gays disgusting"", I qualify as an oppressor and can/should be jailed. FYI, insulting someone and calling them names is not oppression. Forcing someone to shut up over their opinion IS oppresion.

&gt;ton of limits on free speech

No not really. There's just the obscenity laws (which even that can get out of hand; see the whole ""videogames make kids violent"" thing from then 2000s), slander (difficult to prove and prosecute unless you have the money to get a lawyer), and the explicit incitement to violence. Saying you hate gays and calling them f\*gs (free speech) is not the same as publishing their home addresses and explicitly calling for them to the lynched or beaten up.

My final thought to you is this: Hate Speech doesn't exist according to the US, the best place for free speech. Any hate speech laws anywhere can be either fucking useless or extremely dangerous.

Sigh  You moved the goal posts. First you complained Israel violated the UN, but then you reverse course and say well it was unreasonable. 

But what was unreasonable was the Palestinians *refusal to even negotiate*



it was the Palestinians who chose not to accept the UNSCOP majority plan (partition) or even the minority plan of a 'one state' federal plan with autonomy for Arabs and Jews. It was this rejection of any compromise proposals, and the failure to even negotiate that led to the violence. **If the Palestinians and Arabs had accepted either of these plans, or negotiated for a deal with different details, things would have been different. There was easily room in Mandate Palestine for both Jewish and Palestinian nationalism to coexist, there could have been a compromise, but rather than compromise the Palestinians and Arabs rejected peace and chose war.**

&gt;The Report of the Committee dated 3 September 1947[5] supported the termination of the British mandate in Palestine. It contained a majority proposal for a Plan of Partition into two independent states with Economic Union (CHAPTER VI) and a minority proposal for a Plan for one Federal union with Jerusalem as its capital (CHAPTER VII).The Zionist side accepted the Plan of Partition while the Arab side rejected both proposals.

&gt;They're now going against it. They should have withdrawn and still should withdraw back to the original borders

This is farcical. That war that the Palestinains and Arabs started killed a lot of people. On both sides. The Arab states refused to negotiate a peace with Israel after the war with Israel unless it withdrew, which of course was an extremely illogical proposal considering they had just lost a war of aggression they started. **They chose to gamble on a military solution hoping they could kill their way to victory over Israel and instead were beaten.** There is no reset button, especially since the people who died in the war the Arabs started can (I hope you realize this) not be resurrected.

Israel will never return to those borders not out of malice, but because it was the Arabs who rejected them and showed that their hostility was so great as to launch a combined war of aggression. How could Israel return to the borders the Arabs launched a war of aggression from? Those borders had one shot to be implemented otherwise their would be the war everyone hoped to prevent and yet the Palestinians and Arabs precisely chose war, and those borders and the UN resolution were then over.

617,"As I understand the reason why she is so focused on internal matters is because she expects to influence domestic policy when she gets elected president. Which is extremely undemocratic, our constitution envisioned the role the president only in foreign policy. While she and Grybauskaite would like to see the role of the president becoming more similar to that in France or US. Which is not per say a problem if we decide to change our governmental system (though I  am all the way for parliamentary republic). The problem is that we have a system where we vote for the president under the grounds of they being in charge of foreign policy, but then we elect these people and they influence the domestic policy in all sort of ways, but people have not voted for it. Not only is that undemocratic  but it also reduces the level of democracy in the country. President is not held accountable for their domestic policy influence, so voters don't have a say on one hand. On the other hand when they do express their will in parliamentary elections with regards to domestic policy they are not able to judge the parliament's performance because it is difficult to discern whether particular outcomes are due to parliament's actions or presidents.",,/r/europe/comments/bnzjt3/voting_results_gitanas_nausėda_a_54yearold/enc7a5j/,NormalYellow7,1557762000

625,"That might be the case for our products. I'd rather buy a German product than any other product, if I have the choice. German production does indeed stand for quality, in many cases.

My comment is more about corruption, inequality and I didn't even mention all the other things I am unhappy with.

But it probably won't take long until another German comments here and tells you how good we have it Germany. This is the contrast we have. Inequality.. a lot of people made it, and a lot of people didn't.

The shift from our own currency to the Euro currency basically hit my circle and family quite hard. We're on the loser side since almost two decades. We didn't profit from anything our politicians did. Our income was basically cut in half, and prices of products were doubled. Since then, people I know jump from one month to another, barely able to save money or to make holidays (it's not uncommon that people eat noodles the last week in a month, just to get to the next month, or other creative ways to save money and awaiting next job payment).

Talking about honesty, I personally believe that Germans are the most dishonest people on this planet. They're perky, arrogant and do only think about their own benefits. You can trust some people if you know them long enough, but relations between strangers are shaped by suspicion. This includes neighbors, colleagues and what not. It's a narcissistic society where you need to learn to be narcissistic as well, if you don't want that anyone pees on your leg.
Disfavor is very big here too, and it's usually targeted at those who are already poor, because they should stay poor. So, you need connections, get a good position. With that said, nepotism is a big thing here too, and then we're not too far away from corruption.

I can just speak for myself, my friends and my family. When we speak in general, about the collective, the whole society in Germany in general, we absolutely dislike Germany. And we hate out politicians, who act like some hardcore communists, while trying to appear like do-gooders.

If you hear me saying that I love Germany, then it's not about people, but about things that mean ""home"" to me. Like the Baltic Sea for example.. I love Germany as a place. I love the place where I live, but I absolutely dislike this society, and I hope one day there will be a disruptive political shift so that future generations are not lied to, and that they can live better.

As you might have noticed... I am the wrong person to tell you a lot of good things about Germany. :) I'm generally a happy person, but I don't feel like being part of this society, nor do I want to be part of such a hypocritical society.

As it is today, there are always two sides. A winner and a loser side. I don't think the contrast is as big as you see it in the USA (like pure wealth against people sleeping on the streets)... no, not as bad.

Huh ? The first Chechen war had around 8,732 military casualties (this is a low range estimate as exact numbers aren't so easy to come by) and from 30,000 to 80,000 civilians killed. And that was the less bad war, the second war even worse. 

The war in dombass has around 13,000 killed overall. They are vastly difference in scale and brutality. 

&gt;In the wider context of the whole of USSR they would have been marginal conflicts, if there still had been a USSR.

Not really, I think the USSR would have seen them as quite a big deal. Though on comparison of what could have been if the breakup went really badly then sure. 

&gt;The point is, the breakup itself was ""miraculously non-violent"", as there was no significant violence from either the state (most notable exceptions being Tbilisi and Vilnius), or those breaking it up. 

Well you clearly don't know that much if you think only Tbilisi and Vilnius was the only violence. There was the September events, there was the Osh riots and maybe some others I haven't thought of. It also lead to some ethnic conflicts between the nations that came out of it as well as groups within nations. It wasn't a non-violent event, it just wasn't massively violent compared to what could have been. 

&gt;The conflicts took place after the breakup, either between or within parts of the former USSR and resulted from local issues.

Why not link to the offical Brexit prediction paper from the treasury. It is very detailed and specific to what will unfold immediately after a vote and into the negotiating period. ""This paper focuses on the immediate economic impact of a vote to leave and the two years that follow""

It specifies in great detail which locations and which industries will suffer the 500,000 job losses in the 2 years after the referendum. The detail is incredible really.

It was released a month before the referendum as part of project fear, so it doesn't pull any punches. With the passage of time, it has also been proven to be complete bullshit.

I don't understand that sentence.

Don't use some idealism to compare it to reality because that's how we got communist Russia, Yugoslavia,China and all the shit that happened there.

But the problem with that argument is that there is not one communist system. Never was. Just like there is not one  fascist system. Just like there is not one capitalist system. There may be some basic ideas that are similar but how those ideas are implemented makes all the difference.

Time to do the math on this:

First, let's ignore all sorts of memory (ram, disk, tape, whatever), the gfx card and just go by the instructions per second the devices can perform. 

The minimum requirements for Crysis was a Pentium 4 with 2.8 GHz.  Let's round that up to 3.0 GHz. Also let's say that with that processor you can reach 30 fps (lol, as if). That means each frame requires 100MHz-seconds or 100 million operations.

The Z3 was running at 4-5Hz, so 4-5 operations per second, for our calculation let's say the higher (faster) number of 5.

IMO biggest difference is Nausėda is slightly more focused on foreign affairs while Šimonytė seems to pay more lip service to internal issues. Talking about foreign affairs, Nausėda is more pro-Visegrad-4, pro-USA, anti-ever-closer-union.

Now if Ukraine has areas that don't want to be part of Ukraine, and the wishes of the population were not taken into consideration during the communist regime, then a conversation needs to be opened up about how sovereignty should be determined, which could result in a partition, power devolution within Russia or Ukraine, etc. 

However, it is nothing more than anti-British prejudice to suggest that Gibraltarians are somehow as Spanish as Russians in the Crimea, and that therefore Gibraltar requires some extra justification for why it should remain British. 

In fact, the people living there have been British longer than those in Bermuda, St. Kitts, or many other post-colonial countries (including Canada) who now have their own sovereignty but retain some degree of connection to governmental structures in the UK. There is no simple ""give this territory 'back' to X"" solution to any of the myriad social, cultural, and national problems that exist in any of these places.

&gt;Military precursors to the KLA began in the late 1980s with armed resistance to Serb police trying to take Albanian activists in custody. By early 1990s there were attacks on police forces and secret-service officials who abused Albanian civilians. By mid-1998 the KLA was involved in frontal battle though it was outnumbered and outgunned. Conflict escalated from 1997 onward due to the Yugoslavian army retaliating with a crackdown in the region which resulted in violence and population displacements. The bloodshed, ethnic cleansing of thousands of Albanians driving them into neighbouring countries and the potential of it to destabilize the region provoked intervention by international organizations, such as the United Nations, NATO and NGOs. NATO supported the KLA and intervened on its behalf in March 1999.",,/r/europe/comments/bo0b8n/national_assembly_of_serbia_aspiring_eu_state/enb8yus/,domokunosan,1557741112

&gt; It just wasn't covered like today where press is looking for new next outrage.

You're making it sound like the riese is cases is ""fake"". It's not fake. It's true and it's alarming.

https://www.nhs.uk/news/pregnancy-and-child/has-measles-really-been-eradicated-in-the-uk/

&gt; ""Elimination"" is the official term used once a country has reduced the number of cases of a disease to a low enough level to stop it spreading through the general population for at least three years.

&gt; Recent NHS data shows that 95% of children are now having their first dose of the MMR vaccination by their fifth birthday, meeting this WHO target for the first time. This means it is far more difficult for diseases to spread because so many people are immune. However, in England:

&gt; In 2016/17, only 87.6% of children had received both doses of the MMR by their fifth birthday. This is lower than the previous two years: 2014/15 (88.6%), 2015/16 (88.2%).

&gt; Only 91.6% had received the first dose of MMR by their second birthday, also a decrease on the previous two years: 2014/15 (92.3%), 2015/16 (91.9%).
This drop in MMR uptake over the past few years means there is a risk that cases of measles will start to rise again, particularly in London where uptake of the vaccination is lower.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/blraw2/measles_infected_34000_in_europe_in_two_months/enazmij/,adevland,1557733023

1016,"&gt;The EU is set up so that it's very hard for ordinary people to even find out who is responsible for the decisions that are taken (it's all hidden behind working groups and committees)

That is actually not different from national parliaments. Or did you think that things were decided in the plenary meetings there?

&gt;and because it spans over two dozen different countries with different languages and different cultures, a coordinated popular response to the EU's actions is impossible to organize. 

If you think that, you've given up on responding to anything that is larger than your country, such as climate change, the economy, and war.

&gt;And even if that weren't the case, the parliament is little more than a rubber stamp, which cannot propose or repeal legislation. 

That can and should be changed, but exactly the same people who like to complain about that are the ones who most ardently oppose giving the EP that power. So what is it that they want?

&gt;This makes it a lobbyist's paradise. You don't have to buy off anyone with a public face, there won't be any public repercussions, and the sheer size alone means that you only have to buy off a few people to have the greater part of a continent arranged in your favour.

Why do you think that lobbyists for the national government are more visible to you, or work differently? 

&gt;Remember how in the US, net neutrality was abolished? It was a guy by the name of Ajit Pai who was responsible, and he is directly appointed by Trump. The decision then had to be approved by Congress, and the voting record for that is public. You can literally make a list of the people who signed off on it, and the only one on it who's not directly elected is Ajit Pai. The rest of them, you could just write a letter saying ""I'm not voting for you anymore because of this"". (Letter-writing campaigns are common in the US.) Their replacements could run on a platform of reinstating net neutrality if they think it will gain them votes. Could you do that in the EU, or would it be committees and working groups all the way down? You could try to punish the MEPs perhaps, for not trying to stop it hard enough, but see again, the impossibility of an EU-wide coordinated popular response.

I don't see the difference. In both cases (and in the national parliaments too) you have legislation that is either designed by the executive power or a parliamentary committee with the aid of experts for the technicalities and mostly decided by members of the parties who specialize in that matter. The rest of those fractions in the parliament will then trust their party comember by default, unless there's a ruckus about it and it becomes a hot political item, in which case they will pay closer attention.

&gt;In smaller countries it's even easier. The VVD party in the Netherlands often has this kind of scandals. They get ridiculed for it, told that their parliamentarians should be wearing sponsor jerseys, and a lot of the more egregious shit just fails. (They tried to give Unilever a tax cut recently. Didn't work, even their own coalition partners turned against them.) Yes, of course there is still lobbying, but it's harder to get away with it and much easier to overturn again. On top of that, the Netherlands is small, which just makes it much less of a tempting target in the first place.

Well, explain then how the VVD has been the leading government party since forever? Or is it that there aren't enough scandals in the EU?",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/bntkxb/you_have_better_things_to_do_on_election_day/enazt7a/,silverionmox,1557733175

https://www.carbonbrief.org/geoengineering-is-no-substitute-for-cutting-emissions-new-studies-show

&gt;Marine cloud brightening (MCB) is potentially a way of “seeding” clouds to reduce incoming solar radiation in the tropics, says lead author Dr Ben Parkes, formerly of the Climate Impacts Group at the University of Leeds, and now at the University of Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris. He explains to Carbon Brief.
&gt;
&gt;“By increasing the cloud droplet number in the clouds, they become brighter and reflect away more incoming solar radiation.”
&gt;
&gt;Parkes and his colleagues ran simulations of a “very mild form” of climate change where carbon emissions rise by 1% a year until atmospheric concentrations reach double pre-industrial levels (560 parts per million, ppm). They then added in a simulation where clouds over 3.3% of the world’s ocean were brightened – predominantly over the Pacific and South Atlantic.
&gt;
&gt;Using a crop model they compared how well spring wheat in China and groundnuts in West Africa would grow under these scenarios when compared to a third “control” scenario that holds atmospheric carbon dioxide at 440ppm.
&gt;
&gt;The results show crop yields are higher under the climate change scenario, and greater still with MCB implemented. The yields increase as a result of lower temperatures, increased rainfall and the boost to crop growth caused by higher levels of carbon dioxide in the air, says Parkes.
&gt;
&gt;The study found mixed impacts on the number of crop failures. Under climate change, the number of failures in groundnut crops in West Africa were lower than the control scenario, and were reduced further with MCB. For spring wheat in China, crop failures under climate change were higher than the control, though MCB scenarios tempered this increase. Generally, MCB was more effective at reducing “mild” crop failures than “severe” ones, the study finds.
&gt;
&gt;Parkes also notes that although geoengineering could bring some benefit to these regions, the impacts may differ elsewhere:
&gt;
&gt;“MCB changes the precipitation rates globally and in regions of reduced precipitation – notably the Amazon but also South East Asia – we would expect an increase in crop failures.

If the Commission repeatedly and in bad faith rejects these, as I said, Parliament can fire the Commission.

There's no reason to say Parliament is a rubbee stamp, since it also has the power to amend the initiatives. Articlev13 saw substantial amendments by the Parluament.

The gap between the ones trying to strenghten the union and the ones keen to abolish it widens, therefore just keeping the status-quo would be an achievement (as he said).

Furthermore decisions about the future need to take the past into consideration. Garton Ash is reciting the historic development and puts it into a modern context.

The Committee president is chosen among the proposed candidates in accordance with the lobby. That is as far fetched from ""the Parliament chooses the Committee president"" as one can get while still being technically true

Repelling legislation doesn't mean anything if you're not the institution that proposes them. Reject it once and they can just propose a similar thing again and again until it halts the whole parliament.   
A nuclear option exists but again it halts the Parliament until new elections are done making it a last resort.

1297,"&gt; Germany does not have a political party exclusively for Turks. America does not have a party for exclusively blacks. (or for Hispanics) France does not have an Africans party. These refute your argument that minorities always vote for one of their own.

That's because voting base for those groups is still very small, but they still do vote as a bloc and their votes are less spread. White people's votes are more spread, and while still biased, it's still more balanced.

&gt; Hypothetical example: How is 1 million whites competing for resources any different than diverse group of 1 million people competing for resources?

In that example the 'competition' boils down to 'in what way do we spend these resources on us.' It's entirely on deciding how to split them, not on a demographic competition to see who they go to. It is already assumed that it will go to whites, as that is the majority. Which is why majority votes are always split - they already got a majority, it will go to them, they can afford to split.

&gt; Not to mention: what resources would this be? You're very vague.

Resources are resources. They can be natural resources, they can be taxes, they can be how taxes are spent. In extreme cases with extreme people in power you can get cut off from resources. If there are 10 groups of people, 10% of population each, and 6 of them decide to form an alliance and clog the resources for themselves, the other 40% of population is going to have a rough time.

&gt; This is the stupidest thing I've heard in a while.

The reason why we won't see a united Europe anytime soon is that on one hand people want to maintain their regional identities, so we cannot simple become one mega-state but we also can't become a federation of the existing nations because any proportional voting mechanism would put the effective power in the hands of two or three countries while any non-proportional mechanism would give the small states too much power.

The solution: Create a Federation of European Regions, but reorganize these regions so that they all have approximately the same population, are small enough to represent a regional identity (smaller than above example) and then give every one of them an equal number of seats in the European Parliament which becomes the ruling body on all centralized functions, while the regions still maintain a certain level of autonomy.

That would also solve many of the separatism issues we currently have in Europe and create a clear cut-over from the old system of separate nation states that would otherwise bring a lot of bagage to any European political union.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bnscq3/if_the_eu_was_split_into_28_states_of_equal/en9qaph/,TRNogger,1557706300

1469,"The architect sends them a model of the building From Revit or sketchup and they have software that will give a general understanding of reverb or sound transmission. They then use that data and input it into a program that was written in house and put it through a speaker system so they can actually hear it. (At least at this one firm that I have experienced). Often misunderstood, the idea that they can hear what a space will sound like is not true to an extent. But what they can do is bring to light the very real difference in sound when specific elements of the design are changed IE: adding sound absorption to certain areas, shape of the hall, and a persons position in the crowd. As it stands right now, acoustic predictive software uses rays to map the sound projection and reflection across the room, however, the University of Edinburgh is working with an acoustician in the US to map waves instead of the rays (because sound is a wave and not a ray) which is theorized to create a more realistic prediction. Current software maps the sound similar to what an architectural rendering does with light, which is not always necessarily accurate.  There is definitely a lot of maths and science to it that I don’t really understand but as an observer to an auralization, the results they can predict are amazing.

1544,"&gt; Popular Greek actor Alexis Georgoulis, currently starring in the television series “The Durrells” as Spiros Halikiopoulos, will be contesting for a seat in the European Parliament in the forthcoming elections of May 26.
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking to the Greek Reporter, Georgoulis, a candidate from the governing SYRIZA party, says that, if elected, one of his aims in Brussels and Strasbourg would be to help support and promote Greek audiovisual media.
&gt; 
&gt; “I was impressed by the work the Greek government did with EKOME, the National Centre of Audiovisual Media and Communication, and I want to help,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; EKOME, founded in 2017 by the Ministry of Digital Policy Telecommunications and Media, aims to make Greece a center of audiovisual production by offering tax incentives to producers.
&gt; 
&gt; Incentives take the form of tax rebates on eligible expenses incurred in Greece, which can amount to 35 percent. The updated legislation provides a more flexible floor for television series (beginning at €30,000 per episode) and a new minimum for digital games (€60,000), while projects are financed without a cap.
&gt; 
&gt; Moreover, the Greek cash rebate can serve as collateral for producers to obtain further funding through the Greek banking system.
&gt; 
&gt; “An organization such as this existed in many countries in the world. Eventually, the current government made it reality in Greece too,” Georgoulis said.
&gt; 
&gt; “Eventually we would like to see an increase in EKOME’s budget to attract more foreign productions and expand its remit to include theatrical productions too,” the actor added.
&gt; 
&gt; If elected, Georgoulis vows to support cultural initiatives throughout Europe. “Culture issues must become more central in the European parliament,” he says.
&gt; 
&gt; One of his ideas, which he hopes to bring up for discussion in Brussels and Strasbourg, is the creation of a Europe-wide festival dedicated to Ancient Greek tragedies.
&gt; 
&gt; Georgoulis says that “Durrells” fans in Britain and beyond should not be alarmed if he is elected. “Strengthening EKOME and promoting other initiatives from the European parliament would help The Durrells, and perhaps many other films, to be shot in Greece.”
&gt; 
&gt; He decided to join SYRIZA in the contest for the European elections because he says the party is fighting against the extreme right, as well as xenophobia, in Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; “We need a Europe that focuses on society, culture, needs, and not just numbers. We need another culture, a new logic, beyond excessive consumerism,” he declares.
&gt; 
&gt; Georgoulis was born near the town of Larissa in central Greece. He is the third of four siblings, including two older brothers and a younger sister.
&gt; 
&gt; For four years now, he has played a beloved character in the British television show “The Durrells,” which is directed by Steve November. The series, which portrays a real-life expatriate British family, takes place on the idyllic Greek island of Corfu in the 1930s.
&gt; 
&gt; In 2007, Georgoulis, along with Nia Vardalos and Richard Dreyfuss, starred in the successful movie “My Life in Ruins,” which was directed by Donald Petrie and produced by Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson.",D.P.R.H - Democratic People's Republic of Hellas,/r/europe/comments/bnuo0d/alexis_georgoulis_star_of_british_hit_tv_show/en9all0/,NeutrollGreek,1557697848

First, on my behalf, as Russian, I am kinda sorry in all that 1939-1989 thing. I wish Poland was developed by at least DDR levels, instead of veing just a puppet state, a buffer in a giant geopolitical game of two superpowers. 

But as a communist I may say, that such a fate is inevitable. Those, who are weak are always about to get into somebody's influence or fight till their death and hope the victor will spare them. 
Poland tried to act agressively in early XX cent. It has taken off Soviet territories, right after the German retreat in 1918. It tried to invade other countries. It attacked Czechslovakia alongside Third Reich. But nobody is crying about poor czechslovakians are not victimised in a proper was and their property stolen. Same you did with Vilno. So, Poland, at the 1939 period was very far from being a victim. After German invasion? Yes, sure. It was so after. 

About soviet union. Do you imply, thta the parts of Poland, that were occupied by USSR would be better to be occupied by Germany instead? Katyn? Mass murders from Soviets? Yes, they existed. But, compared to General-Governacy...

After the war it was pretty much obvious that Soviet allies are not going to do what they promised. Korea was already split apart. Trizonia was about to make a money reform, which will economically divide two Germanies. Communist parties were haunter in many countries. Why must USSR have fulfilled it's promises if our allies were never going to?

Imagine if Finland held San Marino. Italy would rightly be upset and want it t itself, why should some distant country hold a piece of territory that is within its ""natural"" borders? 

On the other hand, there is no law that UK shouldn't be able to hold Gibraltar, indeed it is given to it by presumably legal treaties, and its population wants to stay with the UK, and it has been in British hands longer than it was ever in Spanish hands. And I think we have reached a point in European history that we don't want anyone to go annexing territories under threats again, lest we unleash a new era of wars for land. 

Personally, I think Gibraltar is something of a historical anomaly, a piece of land that ought to have come to Spain's posession sometime during the decline of the British empire. But it didn't, and that time is over. UK has the right to keep it.

In countries that have a clear majority the votes tend to be split - spare for minorities, who tend to vote for their own; in countries that are diverse and without clear majority - racial, ethnic, religious or cultural - people tend to vote for their own. When it comes down to it, it's all a competition for resources. 1 mil people will create set resources. If theres only one group, it all goes to that group - that groups culture, religion, schools, festives, whatever. If that mil has 10 different groups, resources get split, and everyone get worse everything.

This is why study done on diverse neighborhoods showed that people display lower levels of trust - in their own group, other groups and in government - as well as lower levels of charity and less participation in social events.

""Purity"" does have benefits. Less social and cultural divisions, more cohesion, and all resources go to your group, rather than split between different groups.

Ik zeg trouwens niet dat het ontkennen van het broeikaseffect of het ontkennen van CO2-uitstoot verboden moet worden, maar wel dat je daar geen podium aan moet geven. Media hebben een verantwoordelijkheid om burgers goed in te lichten. Als je twee kanten uitnodigt, waarin één kant tot dan toe marginaal is en onwaarheden verkondigt, terwijl de andere kant gewoon gelijk heeft (dus dan heb ik het over mensen die gewoon hun kinderen laten vaccineren, mensen die gewoon denken dat roken tot kanker kan leiden, mensen die gewoon denken dat het klimaat verandert door toedoen van de mens en dat dat nog voorkomen kan worden, mensen die gewoon denken dat de holocaust slecht was en dat racisme niet moet kunnen), leidt dat er altijd toe dat er toch wel mensen zijn die denken van 'hey, ze hebben allebei wel een punt. Ik begin te twijfelen'. Media moeten verantwoordelijk omgaan met de macht die ze hebben en op zulke belangrijke gebieden (volksgezondheid en klimaat) niet opzettelijk onwaarheden laten verkondigen via hun podium. Je kunt veel beter discussies toelaten over hoe je weer bij 95%+ vaccinatiegraad komt en hoe je klimaatverandering het beste kan aanpakken.

News of the week: This whole week the news was overshadowed by the assault and murder of the 23 year old student Julie Van Aspen (see [my post from last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/bkvrp3/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20190505/emk3ofb/)), which has shocked the country.

* Saturday, in the early evening Julie left her home in [Schilde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schilde) by bike to go out with her friends in [Antwerp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp). When she didn't arrive hours later, she was immediatly reported missing. The investigation went really quick. On sunday they found some of her belongings along the route she took in the north of Antwerp, including a blooded jacket. On monday a suspect was arrested, identified by camera footage, and her body was found in a canal.
* The suspect, 39 year old Steve B, has confessed. B has been convicted of two earlier rape cases already, the last one dating from 2017. In this case he was sentenced to four years in prison, but he went into appeal and thus remained free until the case would be opened again (normally that would be next month).
* It's the latter fact that shocked the public. Most people feel like Julie's murder could've been prevented if he'd been in prison. The court of Antwerp got a lot of criticism for being too slow, the judge has been criticised for not keeping B in custody despite him being a recidivist rapist. Now justice has become one of the main issues in the election campaign for the [elections on the 26th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Belgian_federal_election). Especially Federal Minister of Justice [Koen Geens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koen_Geens) (CD&amp;V) has been put in to the defensive.
* Apart from criminal reform, a lot of attention has been brought on the issue of sexual violence as well. Later today a march against sexual violence will take place in Antwerp, 1000s of people are expected to attend.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/bnn386/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20190512/en7adx9/,historicusXIII,1557655245

Whether it’s between or among EU institutions, Member States or politicial parties, compromises have to be made. In the Netherlands we have seen the power of compromises following our participation in governments throughout the years. This has enabled us to be the first country in the world to legalise gay marriage, introduce progressive laws on abortion or nowadays, push the climate change agenda and be at the forefront of carbon reduction regulations.   
At the European Parliament this is no different. There’s a need to find common ground between different actors and parties. D66 believes that ALDE is the best EP-group for us to be in to advance our goals.Sometimes that means we’ll end somewhat more on the right end of the political spectrum. But it also means that we’re more likely to push ALDE to left or centre left on some issues.

2245,"Because no example of this ever happening shows there isnt even any precedent to do it. The only reason reasoning you have for a 2nd referendum is completely subjective and goes against how democracy functions (people vote and their decision is carried out).

&gt;There is no special law needed. The parliament can hold a referendum every day if they wish. It's their decision. Show a law that having two referenda in a certain timespan on the same issue isn't allowed.  
&gt;  
&gt;And by the same power they can decide to hold another one. If you want to argue formalities, well, it's non-binding. Case closed.

My point wasnt that it is illegal, just that having a 2nd referendum isnt based on anything other than subjective criteria that are just being made up after the ""wrong"" result came out.

&gt;So, if you know that the referendum wasn't binding, why do you hold that we should act as if it was?

Because that is what the UK parliament declared they would do. 

Why do you want a 2nd referendum so much, it will also be non binding and the parliament can just ignore it as well?

&gt; If the parliament resolves to increase taxes and they change their mind, are you also going to be mad?  

Of course, wouldnt you? Using your logic there should be new elections right away, since they couldnt deliver what they promised. But thats not how democracy works.

&gt; If you order a pizza, and get one with a turd on it, would you then eat it because you decided to order a pizza beforehand? 

I dont mean to be insulting, but that is an idiotic comparison. You can ""prove"" almost anything with comparing voting to things like ordering food.

&gt; You implied that my position on whether to agree with a second referendum depended on the outcome I prefer, but that argument applies equally to your position.

That doesnt really match up with what you were replying to.  While it would be a reasonable (but not true) suspicion that I am against a 2nd referendum because leave won,  you were talking about me being against people changing their mind, that is ridiculous. People can change their mind whenever they want, but that doesnt mean they get to automatically change a democratic decision. For example if after a year a government loses their first position in polls, there arent new elections because ""people changed their mind"". 

Regarding your suspicion, its not true, if the roles were reversed or the vote was about something else, I would have the exact same position, its not about leave/remain for me, its about referendum and fulfilling a democratic decision made by the people.

&gt;May's deal wasn't on the ballot, nor was a dealless Brexit. 

Thats true, but it doesnt change the fact that if the UK doesnt leave (that is what the 2nd referendum is about), the 1st referendum will be ignored and their decision becomes meaningless.

&gt;You don't even know the decision of the democratic majority, because you refuse to hear it.

I dont need to know it, not until the decision of the democratic majority that was already made is fulfilled. Again, with the government losing in polls after a year scenario, you could say the same thing to the government that is refusing to have new elections because of that. While it might sound nice, doesnt mean there should be new elections because ""people changed their mind"".

&gt;Like I said above: ""for any referendum that strands a few digits from 50/50, would set foreign policy in a crucially different direction, turns out to be vastly more complicated and harder to get done than expected, while the elected representatives of the people either can't or don't want to do it, and the result is hard to revert."" Then bloody hell yes.

And for the n'th time, this is just a subjective criteria that you think is fair, its not based on anything.

&gt;*You* are the one imposing subjective restrictions on the ability of the population to give input through a referendum.

No, no Im not. There is nothing subjective about the foundations of democracy. People have a vote - their decision is fulfilled. There are no examples of what you are proposing, its not based on anything other than, you think you know best when that should happen.

&gt;What is democratic about forcing an extremely contested implementation of an extremely contested referendum that was kept years ago when it wasn't remotely clear what the actual implementation would look like?

Its democratic to follow the basic way a democracy works. People vote -&gt; decision is made - &gt; that is fulfilled. If you want to cut off that last part, the decision becomes meaningless and people lose their power to decide if a result can be ignored.

&gt;By your reasoning, the UK already had a referendum about EU membership a few decades ago, so case closed, no new referendum. Democracy is not picking the referendum/election result you like and then refusing new input from the population afterwards.

Nope, the first referendum in the '70s decision was fulfilled (automatically) by the UK staying in then.

2257," While we’ve definitely seen a surge of more far-right parties in national elections across Europe. I’d hesitate to call these parties extremist in the classical sense of the word. Most of the parties that are generally classified as right-wing extremist still adhere to the rules of democracy, and represent at least a part of the population that finds a voice in these members of national and European parliament. Even so, in the previous elections we’ve seen liberals and progressives get consistent majorities in major elections, such as Macron’s election in France, the defeat Wilders’ PVV had in the Netherlands, and the presidential elections in Austria, where a green liberal won the presidency in favour of a conservative candidate.

Having said that, it’s important to acknowledge that right-wing conservatism is on the rise, and that it’s up to progressives and liberals to offer a coherent answer to this rise other than that we disagree with it. I look forward to having debates with representatives of far right parties in the European Parliament. That is the place to have those debates. We should not be scared to do so I think. It is part of our democracy.",,/r/europe/comments/bng3jp/ask_me_anything_i_am_candidate_member_of_european/en73khy/,raoulboucke,1557648888
2258,"Although I don't think EU uniting could ever happen, nor that it'd be a ""brighter future"" at least not for all of us. Say Romania might gain from it as right now they have to deal corruption and poverty. But for Sweden it'd pretty much ruin the ""Swedish model"" which doesnt only include how unions and jobs work but how it all just work togheter, how we swedes are as a people, how the government works and so on.


And I don't see happening because there will never be a majority supporting such an proposal in all EU member states. A overwhelming majority of Swedes DON'T see ourselves as ""Europeans"", we dont care about what happens in Bryssel because Bryssel in most cases is doing shit that has nothing to do with us and in a sense most people feel like they're ignored by Bryssel and the EU so they stop caring about what they're doing. 



A few months ago with class we went on some political stuff with class and got see one of our EU MEP's who's now actually removed for her parties voting tickets because she had been medling with both Swedish and EU money a bit too much for their party to support her. Nonetheless she was ""EU federalist""(Her party the ""Liberals"" are the only ""EU federalist"" party in Sweden) She asked how many of us in the room (We were just teachers, and different classes from different schools) and I kidd you not only the teachers took their hands up, not a single student... Remember we're the next generations politicians.


I also want to add that there is reason why in polls the Liberals have lost more than half of their support namely because they want more EU while the majority of Sweden don't, and because they havent done great on national level either. The party most likely gaining most this time around is SD they might get 4 seats this time around compared to their 2 seats they already have. And they're a EU sceptic party oof.



I also can't see us all uniting because of ethnic differences, nationalist reasons, religious, language, historic reasons and so on... There is just massive difference between countries that just wouldnt hold up and it'd create more conflict between countries and people.



And technically Pajala has always been under Swedish laws as before the time we didnt control the lands Pajala is in it didnt exist, it only exists because we were colonizing our northern lands. Karlskrona used to be Danish lands before 1658. Although you can't really compare that to todays case with EU and its member states. Because we conquered Blekinge and Skåne we didnt unite, and I'm pretty sure EU isnt gonna conquer any land unless it wants to become a tyrant state, it wants to ""unite"". It'll never really happen realistically it will be even harder if we expand the EU too I'd say the differences are just too big. There will then always been some people that will be left out when it comes to the bigger picture and thats unfortunately the smaller member states and I'd say Sweden is a smaller member state in the sense of our small population rather then the actual land we have. I've never heard any of baltic countries, malta or Cyprus when it came to the EU, literally never because the hold so little influnce over EU it might as well be like they arent in it.



And that about lobbyism... That rarely happens in Sweden and its never been a thing really, but we could just very recently see that lobbying in the EU for new copyright directive works wonders... I dont want shit thats lobbied for by big corporations and/or wealthy business men and/or other people.


and you might wanna read up on Swedish history once more as Götaland and Sveland never really united and because well there has never been a peaceful uniting of any Swedish lands. And the Division wasnt as simple as Götaland and Svealand and there also no absolute truth to how Sweden became well Sweden as there isnt much historical proof to any of theories which have popped up through the ages. Not even this unification theory holds up.. You cant even date when Sweden became Sweden its that hard. The only time we have solid evidence that Sweden existed is right before the Kalmar union in the 14th century a bit too late for any other theory also to hold up. Oh we dont like unions because of the Kalmar union.

Having said this I think we still have a huge challenge with regards to climate change. Globally not enough is being done to curb CO2 emissions. I believe the EU should use it's market power (largest in the world) to gently force other economic blocs to curb emissions. We could do so by setting clear demands when other blocs want to trade with us.

2342,"Yeah. I like the idea in principle, but the wage is ether something that works in Eastern Europe but it miserably low in the West or it's fine for the West but crippling for the East. 

A minimum wage similar to that in the US, say 7€ an hour, 280€ a week, 1176€ a month, that's a really, really solid wage. It's also 300€ above our current average wage, meaning for a new lot of people it would be a hell of a lot more than that.

Since most business don't have a huge pile of money just ready and waiting for stuff like this, we have a chicken and egg problem. You would need to significantly raise prices, but no one got any extra money yet so people can’t buy the goods until their new higher paycheck, except they won't get one since no one can afford any of the new prices.

The more invidious outcome is intervention for organisations that do have the money. Foreign banks could cover the cost, the price being a near total takeover of our market by outside interests. 

And of course, like I said, if we put the minimum wage at a level appropriate for Eastern Europe, it's absolutely meaningless anywhere else. Even something like a percentage of the average wage is less than ideal because, while it might work fine for larger countries, smaller countries tend to have highly skewed averages.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/bncuj5/socialists_plan_euwide_minimum_wage_if_they_win/en6ugb2/,neohellpoet,1557641097

To bring up a popular quote from the Brexit debate:

&gt; Our constant aim must be to build and fortify the United Nations Organisation. Under and within that world concept we must re-create the European family in a regional structure called, it may be, the United States of Europe, and the first practical step will be to form a Council of Europe. If at first all the States of Europe are not willing or able to join a union we must nevertheless proceed to assemble and combine those who will and who can. The salvation of the common people of every race and every land from war and servitude must be established on solid foundations, and must be created by the readiness of all men and women to die rather than to submit to tyranny. In this urgent work France and Germany must take the lead together. Great Britain, the British Commonwealth of Nations, mighty America — and, I trust, Soviet Russia, for then indeed all would be well — must be the friends and sponsors of the new Europe and must champion its right to live. Therefore I say to you “Let Europe arise!”

— [Winston Churchill, September 19, 1946, Zurich](https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1946-1963-elder-statesman/united-states-of-europe/)

That was over a decade before the [Treaty of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome) was signed:

&gt; The Treaty of Rome brought about the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC), the best-known of the European Communities (EC). It was signed on 25 March 1957 by Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany and came into force on 1 January 1958.

I'll grant that Churchill also clearly didn't include the UK in his EU vision, so it's not much of an argument against the UK saying ""we're gonna go do our thing while you do the EU"".  But it is an argument against the idea that the UK simply was blindly unaware of the intended goals of European integration.

One example I've given is that as you say, the federal government's authority is over *interstate commerce*, and doesn't generally have authority to mandate on trade strictly within a state.  This is not the case foe thr EU, where the central government can mandate standards even internally.

Some examples:

* After Hollywood gangster movies started a hysteria, a number of states banned switchblades, and the federal government banned them in interstate commerce, but they are legal within individual states.

* The federal government bans trade in raw (unpasteurized) milk between states, because it's a disease vector.  Some people believe that there are health benefits of raw milk (IMHO, they're quite wrong, but then, Europe also commonly trades in raw milk, so I suspect the readership here might well not have that opinion), and so some states in the US permit legal internal trade in raw milk.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/bncuj5/socialists_plan_euwide_minimum_wage_if_they_win/en6lxsw/,vokegaf,1557634981

2478,"Technically, Hitler got his position after some hardball political maneuvering with von Papen and Hindenburg.

Germans did vote him to the brink of that position, though — he certainly had to work from some electoral support.

[How Hitler became Chancellor, 1932-33](https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/z3bp82p/revision/7)
&gt;
&gt;The chain of events that led to Hitler’s appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933 is a complicated one.
&gt;
&gt;Chancellors in this period were normally weak because proportional representation made it hard for political parties to gain a majority of seats meaning the Chancellor found it difficult to control the Reichstag. By 1932 President Hindenburg had to use Article 48 to pass almost every law.
&gt;
&gt;It was against this backdrop that the events of 1932 ad 1933 unfolded.
Major events leading to Hitler becoming Chancellor
&gt;
&gt;1932
&gt;
&gt;April – Presidential election. **Hitler came second to Hindenburg**, who won 53 per cent of the vote to Hitler’s 36.8 per cent.
&gt;
&gt;May – Brüning resigned as Chancellor. Hindenburg appointed Franz Von Papen, a conservative, as his replacement.
&gt;
&gt;July – Reichstag elections. The Nazis became the largest party with 230 seats. Hitler demanded to be made Chancellor but Papen remained.
&gt;
&gt;November – Reichstag elections called by Von Papen to try to win a majority in parliament. Nazis lost 34 seats but remained the largest party with 196 seats.
&gt;
&gt;December – Von Papen resigned. Hindenburg appointed Kurt Von Schleicher, an army general, as Chancellor. Von Schleicher tried to split the Nazis by asking a leading Nazi called Gregor Strasser to be his Vice Chancellor. Hitler forced Strasser to decline.
&gt;
&gt;1933
&gt;
&gt;January – Von Papen and Hindenburg turned to Hitler, appointing him as Chancellor with Von Papen as Vice Chancellor. They believed they could control Hitler and get him to do what they wanted.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/bneo72/dunes_in_kaliningrad_oblast_the_small_part_of/en6bas3/,vokegaf,1557625659

&gt;
&gt;&gt;The Conference has agreed in principle to the proposal of the Soviet Government concerning the ultimate transfer to the Soviet Union of the City of Koenigsberg and the area adjacent to it as described above subject to expert examination of the actual frontier.[13]

2542,"&gt; Are you talking about like health care or??? I know the environment is a EU heavy subject not so much the member states.

Anything where the EU pursues a unified approach, really. The legal integration and unification the European Union has pursued for decades - much of it to ensure compliance on the Single Market - has a ton of Directives that represent significant change for some Member States whilst being inconsequential for others.

I ask why you'd oppose EU legislation that wouldn't even have any practical effect on your country, and the only reasoning you provided is because it'd give the EU more power. Well, okay, I suppose that's something we may just have to agree to disagree on -- for to me as an idealist for federalization, that's a *good* thing. Because on numerous occasions the EU has enacted beneficial Directives against the interests of individual Member State national governments, whose members were thinking only of themselves or are too entrenched in a web of lobbyism. Case in point: the new Whistleblower Directive. Right now, only 10 countries in the EU have whistleblower protection, and the EU now moving to mandate it as part of union law is, in my eyes, a decidedly *good* thing, because it's going to help expose corruption.

&gt; Although there isnt any difference in laws in Karlskrona and say Pajala even thought the 1600km distance between them but there's big difference in laws in say Copenhagen and Hamburg a 350km distance because they are situated in entirely different countries with very different laws.

Different laws *for now*. I'm sure you are aware that Germany is also a *Federal* Republic, and that its geographic region was at a time split up into numerous smaller entities all with different laws and regulations. (in fact, different laws are still a thing to a degree, they're just superseded by uniform federal law)

People pay too much attention to national borders. They were often arbitrarily drawn and are surprisingly malleable if we look back at history instead of only looking at the here and now. In fact, I'm no expert on Swedish history, but I'm fairly sure that there was a time where Karlskrona and Pajala had different laws as well. And just like the cities in Germany and Sweden came together to form a bigger nation, why should the Member States of the EU not do similar and join together for a brighter future as well?`Unless you want to argue your country did *not* benefit from Svealand and Götaland unifying into the Kingdom of Sweden.

But I suppose we just have different ideas as to how the ""ideal Europe"" should look like, and I can at least respect your opinion, though I do not share it.

&gt;When you boil your comments down to their core arguments what you are saying is that, the contents of the reactor are highly radioactive, remote repair will be necessary, and if anything goes wrong it will be expensive.

&gt;Do I understand you correctly?

233C's response:

&gt;**That's pretty much it.**

-------------------------

Yes repair work will be done remotely and that is expensive, but this is factored into the cost projections already, and it is projected to be cheaper than coal even with remote repair work.

Yes fission products are HIGHLY radioactive, I wouldn't want to sleep on a bed of spent fuel rods either.

2595,"&gt;There is no conspiracy to not go into thorium

The pressurized water reactors we use today were originally designed for use in submarines. When time came for us to use nuclear reactors for civilian power generation, we were already heavily invested in this type of reactor. There was a strong incentive not to ""reinvent the wheel"".

There was funding for the ARE (Aircraft Reactor Experiment), which was the first molten salt reactor, which eventually led to the MSRE. The MSRE went critical on U233 and proved LFTRs viability. (U233 is bred from Thorium and is the actual fuel of a LFTR.)

Eventually the air force realized it was idiotic to put a reactor in an airplane, U233 bred from Thorium was difficult to weaponize due to inherent U232 contamination which has daughter fission products that are strong gamma emitters and destroy bomb electronics as well as delivering lethal doses of radiation meaning weapons would have to be assembled/handled remotely, not to mention that satellite gamma detectors can see such strong gamma emissions clearly making it impossible to hide such a weapon.

The Nixon administration pulled funding for the MSRE and fired Alvin Weinberg (who invented and held the patents for the reactors we use today) from his post as head of Oak ridge National Laboratory, when he refused to sit down and shut up about the safety and economic advantages of Thorium MSR. Alvin believed Thorium MSR was the correct path forward, not the liquid metal fast breeder.

The Nixon administration instead choose to pursue the liquid metal fast breeder a sodium cooled reactor. This reactor could breed PU239 from U238 for use in weapons.


--------------------

-----------------

--------------------

Operation Teapot MET was a mixed core Uranium 233 (Bred from Thorium), and Plutonium 239 weapon and had such a low yield it was attributable to it's Plutonium 239 content alone, and was considered a failure. This occurred in 1955 before the MSRE. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Teapot

The Nixon administration had already decided on the LMFBR which could breed Plutonium 239 from Uranium 238. Alvin Weinberg was fired from his post as head of Oak Ridge National Lab because he refused to sit down and shut up about the economic benefits and safety advantages of LFTR.

When Dr. Alvin Weinberg’s published his memoir book, “The First Nuclear Era”, in 1994, most Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s (ORNL’s) MSR researchers were shocked when they read on page 200 that their Director of 18 years had been fired in 1972 for advocating the MSR instead of the Republican Party (AKA “GOP” - Grand Ole Party) selected Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (LMFBR) and reprocessing plutonium nuclear fuel for Mixed OXide (MOX) fuel elements in the already existing Light Water Reactors (LWRs). **Alvin Weinberg clearly explains in his memoir, on pages 198 - 199 (ibid), how the Republican Party and the Nixon Administration had already selected the LMFBR:**

...

For Dr. Weinberg’s support of the MSR and increased nuclear safety, he was fired in 1972: 

...

‘The best way to stop a Revolution is to shoot the leader’, or in a civil or commercial arena, fire the innovator. After Dr. Weinberg was fired as Director of ORNL, there was no MSR development during the remaining Nixon and Ford Presidential terms besides the publishing of ORNL’s final reports.

--------------------

http://www.oakridger.com/article/20131217/NEWS/131219922

A major drama in Weinberg’s life was his clash with Milton Shaw, director of the AEC’s reactor division. ... Shaw pushed for the development and demonstration of the liquid metal fast breeder reactor (LMFBR), whereas Weinberg advocated support for the molten-salt breeder reactor, an ORNL invention based on the thorium-232–uranium-233 cycle.

...

------------------


I found myself increasingly at odds with the reactor division of the AEC. [The Director of the Reactor Division at the time was Milton Shaw. Milt was an amiable, but dedicated engineer. He was a graduate of the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology. (Once, when I became particularly annoyed with him, I looked up his grades at ORSORT (he was neither the best nor the worst student.) He had a very successful career with Admiral Rickover's naval reactor division and had been the program manager of the Shipping port project. Milt was cut very much from the Rickover cloth: he had a singleness of purpose and was prepared to bend rules and regulations in achievement of his goal. **At the time he became director of reactors, the AEC, at President Nixon's direction, had made the liquid-metal-cooled fast breeder (LMFBR) the primary goal of its reactor program. Milt tackled the LMFBR project with Rickoverian dedication: woe unto any who stood in his way. This caused problems for me since I was still espousing the molten-salt breeder.]**

Milt was like a bull. Extremely hard working, terribly demanding, single minded. He enjoyed the confidence of Commissioner Jim Ramey, and of Rep. Chet Holifield-so his position within the AEC was unassailable. And, although I found Milt pleasant enough, it was clear that he had little confidence in me or, for that matter, in ORNL. After all, we were pushing molten salt, not LMFBR. More than that, we were being troublesome over the question of reactor safety. Milt, and even Jim Ramey, seemed to be convinced that our concerns were not genuine, but rather were conjured up by us to increase the AEC's support of our work on reactor safety.

That something was seriously amiss became apparent to me around 1972. Floyd Culler and I were talking to Chet Holifield about our work on reactor safety. Chet was clearly exasperated with me, and he finally blurted out, ""Alvin, if you are concerned about the safety of reactors, then I think it may be time for you to leave nuclear energy."" I was speechless, but not Floyd: ever my staunch right hand, he protested that Chet was wrong, that he couldn't really have meant what he said. But it was apparent to me that my style, my attitudes, and my perceptions of the future were no longer in tune with the powers within the AEC: Milt Shaw, Bob Hollingsworth (general manager of the AEC), Jim Ramey, and, most important, Chet Holifield.

I was so angry at Holifield's warning that I agreed to have dinner with Ralph Nader shortly afterward. I explained to Ralph what I perceived to be the situation with regard to reactor safety that it was probabilistic, not deterministic, but that I considered reactors to be adequately safe. I then conveyed to him my sense that the AEC was not pursuing the issue of reactor safety sufficiently vigorously, and I mentioned Chet Holifield's admonition. I am not proud of my having talked to Ralph about these matters: I have generally found Ralph's extremism distasteful, and I believe his vicious attacks on nuclear energy are irresponsible. But neither could I condone the attitude of the atomic-energy establishment exemplified by Chet Holifield's outrageous remark--that concern for reactor safety was cause for leaving nuclear development.

 
I suddenly realized that my tenure as director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory might be coming to an end. This was hinted to me by Bob Hart, the Oak Ridge area manager who let on, more or less directly, that 18 years as director may have been long enough. Wally Zinn, who was chair of our Laboratory Visiting Committee, tried to convince me that I should stay and that his committee had full confidence in me. But, despite these reassurances, my days at ORNL were numbered. Finally, late in 1972, John Swartout, my former deputy who by this time was vice president for research of the Union Carbide Corporation in New York, told me I had to go.

2598,"&gt; EU leaders warned Ankara on Thursday to respect the sovereign rights of Cyprus, as a Turkish oil drilling ship travels inside the island’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
&gt; 
&gt; Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades briefed fellow EU leaders on the issue at a summit in Romania.
&gt; 
&gt; “Today President Anastasiades also informed the leaders about the Turkish drilling activities within the exclusive economic zone of Cyprus,” Council President Donald Tusk said at the summit’s closing news conference.
&gt; 
&gt; “The European Union stands united behind the Republic of Cyprus and expects Turkey to respect sovereign rights of the EU member states. The European Council will continue to follow these developments closely.”
&gt; 
&gt; Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said he stood firmly behind Cyprus and urged Turkey to refrain from provocations.
&gt; 
&gt; “At the next summits, in May and June, the EU must examine the steps and measures that are necessary if Turkey’s provocative behavior continues. Turkey has to understand that it must come to the table and talk, in the same way as other Mediterranean countries, and not proceed with unilateral actions,” Tsipras said.
&gt; 
&gt; Tsipras also noted that the issue of Turkey was a European issue in that the EU, in addition to its geopolitical interests, also had to protect its energy interests and secure energy sources in the Eastern Mediterranean.
&gt; 
&gt; According to a Greek diplomatic source, quoted by the Athens News Agency, the “Juncker spirit” prevailed during the summit meeting, where Turkey’s activities in the Cypriot EEZ were discussed at length. The EU Commission president, on arriving at the summit, had declared, “Today, I am Cypriot.”
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding possible sanctions against Turkey, other diplomatic sources said these could take the form of sanctions against individuals linked to the company that is engaged in the activities in the Cypriot EEZ, or others that are related to EU-Turkey relations, such as pre-accession funds, dialogue on revising customs union, or dialogue on strategic cooperation.",D.P.R.H - Democratic People's Republic of Hellas,/r/europe/comments/bninoo/eu_stands_united_with_cyprus_and_warns_turkey_on/en5zpal/,NeutrollGreek,1557618439

As for ties with Russia: for some reason Russians need to pay 35 euros for a visa, while Belarusians are paying 60 euro (and very likely 80 euro in the near feature). We had 0.32% Schengen rejection rate in 2018 (see https://statistics.schengenvisainfo.com/), possibly one of the lowest rates in the world, so basically they just give visa to everyone who applies and it's just a formality. And 40 million euros paid by Belarusians for visa in 2018 alone. But while it is a formality, it's a pain in the ass and you have to go through this again and again. They rarely give you visa for more than a year with two years being the limit.

And the worst part is that you have to follow some stupid rules while traveling with your visa. While you basically can visit any country in Schengen area, if you applied to Lithuanian embassy you still have to visit Lithuania more than other countries if you want them not to fuck you over and give visa for only 3 months.

&gt; why change it if the change won't actually do anything or just make it a tiny bit harder to achieve what they're already are achieving?

It may not change anything for you, but it can make things better for other countries. How exactly should such a law make things even just ""a tiny bit harder""?

The way I see it, this is like arguing there shouldn't be EU-wide health and safety or environmental protection standards on the grounds that some countries already have them in the form of national laws.

It is complitated. The city was 80% hungarian before WWI, and after the Trianon Treaty, a lot of hungarian majority-areas were given to the sucessor states that fed upon the cropse of Austria-Hungary. Even though the Empire needed (and was doomed to) fall, the treaty was objectively unjust to Hungary, which defined hungarian politics in the XX. century (joining to the Axis to get back territories). It is one, if not the worst event in our history.

The Russian state did not want anybody to help the Forest Brothers out and whoever did that would get in really big trouble.

His neighbors supported the Forest Brothers with food and other handy stuff. One night, the sound of gun fire just next to the house sent everyone to panic. Everyone grabbed whatever they had for defense. They stayed up all night, but it was silent after those few shots next-door. The next morning, the village was shocked - the same family who was supporting the Forest Brothers was shot one by one at night. 2 adults and 3 kids.

Many countries have programs that help unemployed citizens pick up new skills (I recall in Germany participation is actually mandatory if you want to keep receiving the dole), but those tend to focus on things that are easy to learn within a few weeks or months.

2806,"EVERY winter, town squares all over Europe are filled by the hum of Christmas choirs. Towns in northern Italy follow this tradition too, but with a twist. Singers abandon Santa costumes in favour of the distinctive feathered hats of the Alpini, tough soldiers mostly recruited from remote Alpine villages. The Alpini repertoire is different too. Christmas songs are swapped for haunting ballads about the cruelty of war. These canti Alpini—and the soldiers who sing them—have become part of the region’s cultural heritage. 

At first glance, this is surprising. After all, to start with, the Alpini were a decidedly military outfit, established in 1872 to protect the new Italian state from its enemies to the north. Their baptism of fire came during the first world war, fighting the Austro-Hungarians high in the Dolomites. Conditions were terrible: avalanches and frostbite were a constant threat. Despite this, the Alpini notched up some impressive wins. They also fought courageously in the second world war, distinguishing themselves in battles from Ethiopia to the Russian steppe. 


Up to a point, the continued popularity of the Alpini can be explained by their reputation for courage. Their songs reflect their sacrifices. “Among rocks, wind and snow, we are forced to stay awake all night,” one explains. “We started out as twenty-nine,” begins another. “Now we’re only seven.” This pride transcends the songs themselves. Monte Grappa, a famous Alpini victory in 1917, is still commemorated on street signs across the country. Other songs, meanwhile, juxtapose Alpini bravery with the supposed incompetence of other Italian soldiers. In one, the choir warns Luigi Cadorna, the Italian commander in the first world war, that he’ll need the Alpini “if he wants to advance”. The regular conscripts “are too weak” to do the job, while other troops “are mafiosi”. 

But if some Alpini songs stumble towards chauvinism, their enduring reputation is down to their stark anti-war message. “A ‘happy’ death has never existed,” explains Massimo Marchesotti, conductor of the Alpini choir in Milan. “We sing about the truth: of the pointless death…that none of those kids chose for themselves.” The results are intensely moving. In “Oi Cara Mamma”, the Alpini ask what their mothers will do when their sons don’t come back. Elsewhere, the choir tells their lover that they are buried “in a field of edelweiss”. The choir concludes that “when you are alone at home, the edelweiss and I will be with you.” 

The presence of edelweiss is not accidental. Alpini songs have a deep link to the mountain culture that bore them; some of the songs are centuries old. And unlike other wings of the Italian military, “Alpini herald from the same valleys” as their songs, says Mr Marchesotti. Indeed, most songs are odes to the mountains themselves. When a soldier is thirsty, “refreshing snow” will be there to soothe them. A dying captain asks his men to give a part of his body to the mountains so that he blossoms into “roses and flowers”.

This thoughtful melancholy is popular: Alpini choirs still release albums and play concerts all over northern Italy, and interest in them extends beyond their music. Several films and documentaries have been made about their story. A book of Alpini exploits by Mario Stern, a sergeant who fought near Stalingrad, has been republished five times, and has been made into a play. While in Russia, Polenta, as well as the cheese of his native valley, and of course the mountains themselves are constantly on Stern’s mind. “Ghe rivarem a baita?” repeats one of his men, in thick Brescian dialect. “When do we get home?"" Home, or baita in the dialect, is literally a mountain chalet. Once again, Alpini culture is less about martial swaggering, and more a vehicle for nostalgia for beauty of Italy’s northern frontiers. 

This heritage is not as secure as it used to be. Most Alpini regiments were dissolved after the Cold War. The soldiers themselves now come from all over Italy, weakening their cultural link to the Alps. Still, the troops continue to play an active role in Italian life. They fought with NATO in Afghanistan. Their avalanche training has proved useful in earthquake-ravaged corners of the Apennines. Moreover, the national Alpini association, with its 355,000 members, is still important. As well as promoting Alpini culture, local chapters—encompassing both veterans and eager civilians—help their communities in numerous ways. They maintain chapels, and a series of mountain shelters for weary hikers. This dedication has not gone unnoticed, even among civilians. In the Piedmontese town of Biella, 36% of the members of the local association were never soldiers themselves. 

With the centenary of the armistice ending the first world war fast approaching, the Alpini look set to return to the forefront of Italian cultural memory. They are in fierce debate with their Austrian counterparts about where to hold joint commemorations of the fighting. (The Austrians do not want to meet in Alto Adige, a region Italy annexed from Austria after 1918, and which is still mostly German-speaking.) The soldiers have even stumbled into controversy over a new videogame. “Battlefield I” features Alpini fighting on Monte Grappa. The head of the national Alpini association said that “delicate themes, like war, need to be dealt with differently.” The beautiful stock of canti Alpini promises to do just that—long after memories of the 2018 commemorations wisp into the mountain air.",Veneto,/r/europe/comments/bng5sj/the_cultural_resonance_of_italys_alpini/en59phf/,Generale_Lee,1557604098

2816,"I still don't see how a minimum wage should undermine what you already have in place right now. Unions would continue to exist, and they can continue to push for higher wages for their members or their sector, as demonstrated in Germany. The only thing minimum wage would change would be the addition of a ""safety net"" for sectors that don't have a union already, or where the union is weak.

Or do you really think people would decide to leave (or not join or form) a union because they'd be like ""nah, I already have minimum wage, why would I want to unionize for something better""?

&gt; And what many say, don't fix what's not broken.

As per the article, a projected minimum wage for Sweden would be 13.200 krona. Considering that as per [this site](https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/country/sweden) a normal rent for a month is given as 13.056 kr before utilities, I would think that anyone who earns less than that does hint at a problem that should be fixed. I mean, *if* there are people like that, the taxpayer is subsidizing companies paying them less than what they need to make a living, right?

2957,"&gt; Tell me - how long would you be able to intentionally cause yourself pain even knowing it will benefit you in the end? 

Well once you’ve gotten to your target weight there’s no more “pain” in keeping it off.  Maintaining your weight means keeping your body caloric neutral, not at a caloric deficit.  So no matter how you slice it that pain is temporary.  Now yes, of course losing the weight hurts, but you also suffer when you train for an athletic competition (tearing and re-building muscle fibers), study for an exam (mental stress, sleep deprivation), or for plenty other examples.  But very few good things in life come easy, you gotta work for them.  That’s just life man.  Same goes with being “constantly barraged by offers of instant relief”.  Temptations are also part of life, and self-control is the responsibility of the individual.  

And since you asked anecdotally: I’ve cut weight/fat many times while training for races, and yes while it is hard to do, it’s nowhere near as impossible as some people make it out to be.  I’m not “knocking dieters for struggling”, in fact I commend anyone putting in actual effort.  But I do laugh at the willfully ignorant who don’t try *at all* and then make excuses for themselves. The facts stand that yes, the average person is capable of losing weight and keeping it off by consuming less than they burn.  For those who are actively trying, hats off to you.

That's why Europe in the 60's split, with the European Economic Community on one side pursuing political integration, and EFTA on the other developing purely economic ties.

Just read the Schuman declaration, which brought the European Coal and Steel Community to life:

&gt; With this aim in view, the French Government proposes that action be taken immediately on one limited but decisive point.

&gt; It proposes that Franco-German production of coal and steel as a whole be placed under a common High Authority, within the framework of an organization open to the participation of the other countries of Europe. The pooling of coal and steel production should immediately provide for the setting up of common foundations for economic development **as a first step in the federation of Europe**, and will change the destinies of those regions which have long been devoted to the manufacture of munitions of war, of which they have been the most constant victims.

The ECSC went on to create all the main supra-national (-&gt; an e.g. of political integration) institutions of the EU. The inherently political aim of the project should become clear with the foundation of the European Customs Union in 1958 at the latest, since harmonising all external tariffs and having a common trade policy is an inherently political move.",Bern (Switzerland),/r/europe/comments/bncuj5/socialists_plan_euwide_minimum_wage_if_they_win/en4wtps/,Lejeune_Dirichelet,1557597329

3072,"\&gt; To substitute individual transport such public system has to be *very* extensive. Former communist states managed it (due to necessity, there were few private cars), but once people got a chance, they bought a vehicle. So it should not be seen as a situation into which the society gravitates.

&amp;#x200B;

But we now know, with certainty that it does, because of the Anglosphere's mid-20th century deconstruction of their urban transport systems, and their subsequently rebuilding of the in the early 21st.  Which has been made all the more harder for them because unlike Europe's transportation systems, they're trying to build their public transportation on the private-ownership model, which simply isn't working very well, because it's the wrong tool for the job.  


We can learn a lot from the interplay between cars, auto-infrastructure and public transportation.  


\&gt; While possible, public transportation system is (1) expensive and organizationally demanding, and (2) it really helps to have society with stable patterns of movement, e.g. prevalence of long lasting jobs. Success of mass transport (followed by car restrictions) would kill e-cars as mass produced affordable item.

&amp;#x200B;

Except we now know that public transportation defines the patterns of movement, instead of needing to follow them, Companies start gravitating to easy access, once it's provided.  


And your second point is completely untrue. Europe has an almost enviable series of public transport networks that stretch out across all realms of life, we are also one of the world's major car users and producers. Unlike the anglosphere neoliberal terrors that lead to the destruction of their urban tram networks to support their car industry, we did no such thing and have still come out better.",,/r/europe/comments/bn11h3/czech_prime_minister_electric_cars_are_step_to/en49dp4/,InitialEstablishment,1557581823

3157,"Sure, I don't think many people enjoy one-sided conversations either. The problem with meeting Czechs if you are a non-Czech foreigner and you came here in an adult age is that even if you manage to find yourselves in situations where other Czechs are present, we will often put you in some category (collegue, classmate, the foreign guy who goes to the same football trainings as me etc.) and then kinda block you from leveling-up and becoming friends with us by inviting you to share more aspects of our life. And we generally do this especially in moments where we feel that our social circle is already full and we don't have space for other friends.

So basically the key is to find yourselves some people who are looking for new friends. Or people who are at least looking to hang out with a foreigner. This can mean people who are new in the city or people who want to improve their English. Or people who just have a natural curiosity in foreigners. Often these 'relationships' can even be started online, you chat for some time, form some sort of bond, then meet up later.

But to be honest with you - in order to fully experience the Czech culture, you'd need to be really ingrained here, ideally through a romantic relationship, because that way you get an access into a Czech family and you get to see how we live, what traditions we keep, etc., or you'd have to really live here for years and be a part of a group of really good friends.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/bmvq0l/the_share_of_people_who_lack_basic_skills/en4btia/,kristynaZ,1557583655

Sorry but i won't accept any promises for the future anymore when it comes to electric cars. Especially not from Elon Musk:

&gt;2018 came and went. How'd the year go for Musk's to do list?

&gt;* We didn't get a rocket to Mars.
* No manned flights around the moon. No manned flights at all, actually. But [that didn't stop him from selling flights around the moon, now for 2023](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-45550755).
* Instead of 500,000 Teslas, [we got about 250,000](https://www.statista.com/statistics/502208/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-deliveries/).
* No 10GW of panels out of the Buffalo ""gigafactory"" in New York. In fact, [that's kind of a massive fuck-up boondoggle](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-11-20/inside-elon-musk-s-forgotten-gigafactory-2-in-buffalo).
* No self-driving Tesla crossed the USA, not with Tesla's hackjob lidar-less version of it. [Another company did make it from LA to Jacksonville, though](https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/06/embarks-self-driving-truck-drove-2400-miles-across-the-u-s/).
* The [15 mile Boring Co hyperloop tunnel in LA was cancelled](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/11/28/elon-musks-boring-co-drops-one-its-l-tunnel-plans/2135781002/), instead of completed.  We instead got a 1.1 mile 1-lane unidirectional car tunnel without safety egress. It took 2 years. [And the public unveiling was a bad joke](https://jalopnik.com/what-the-actual-shit-was-that-1831214583).
* On the other hand, [we did see a souped up hypermiled Tesla go 606 miles on a charge](https://bgr.com/2018/05/29/model-3-range-record-hypermiling-606-miles-video/). Not quite the 620 promised. But close enough, I'll give it to him. That puts him at 1/7 for 2018.

3198,"Although a visit of a few weeks is a supremely bad way to judge climate (which is measured over a period of 30 years), you are actually almost spot on with your assessment. According to the Köppen Geiger climate classifications http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/present.htm New York and Warsaw are both within the ""C-f"" classification, meaning a warm, temperate, humid climate, with the only difference being that Warsaw (Cfb) gets hotter in the summer, partially due to its continentality (new York (Cfa) is cooled by the labrador ocean currents coming down from greenland). This is interesting to me because Warsaw is significantly further north than NY, which is at a similar lattitude to Rome. If you look at the map, you may notice that the climate zones are all shifted further north on the east side of the atlantic compared to the west. This is due to a number of complicated and interacting Factors, including the gulf stream (bringing warm water to wrstern europe from the caribbean) and labrador currents, as well as things like continentality, trade winds and the jet stream. This is the reason that my hometown in scotland, at a lattitude of 59°N, has winters that rarely drop below 0°, yet is at the same lattitude as killiniq, in the north of Canada, where there are polar bears and walrus.",,/r/europe/comments/bmxi41/europes_most_powerful_passports/en40bhy/,tinyfisch,1557575186

&amp;#x200B;

That's exactly what I was thinking. The war in Syria started almost a decade ago, and ISIS started its activities in Iraq about 15 years ago. There was more than enough time to act so there is no excuse, they can't claim they were caught by surprise.

I don't know how easy is to change the laws in Sweden, but can they be enforced retrospectively? If yes, then that's a solution too. ISIS members can be charged after the laws get approved by the parliament.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Our secret police are activley capturing and the country is now starting  to deport extremists radical islamists, I think in the past 2 weeks  three have already been detained and deported. So things are finally  happening, but more should have been done but it's starting.

&gt; But some countries are now pushing hard for untested technology

None of the technology used is ""untested"". If you're saying that the battery technology isn't fully ready, then sure, but it is not ""untested"". Range is pretty decent [for some models by now](https://www.buyacar.co.uk/cars/economical-cars/electric-cars/726/electric-car-range-how-far-will-they-really-go-on-a-single). The actual propulsion syste, which is a generic induction motor, is far superior to an ICE though:

* Much higher efficiency
* As a result of the above, engine runs cooler
* High torque
* Less moving parts, meaning much easier to manufacture and maintain. Lasts longer.

Although a lot of complexity has moved to the battery manufacturing process, [lifespan for the batteries seem far superior compared to an ICE](https://electrek.co/2018/04/14/tesla-battery-degradation-data/).

3343,"&gt;As those addicted people are already criminals too (because buying drugs  is illegal) they have a harder time getting rid of their addiction as  they are in danger to get arrested if they seek help.

Only drug cartels and dealers should be charged with an offense and face very harsh penalties. I disagree with prosecution of drug addicts. I don't think that it offers anything. these people only should be offered a way out of their ordeal.

&amp;#x200B;

Legalizing the use in a supervised environment to help addicts take control of their situation and save their lives sounds OK.  
But I'm not sure if legalizing drugs like heroin that has a very high physical and psychological dependence potential is safe to do without testing the method in smaller groups. Doing it at once can backfire and create an addiction epidemic.

Alcoholism is the most common addiction (of different substance abuses), because alcohol is readily available. So we can't be 100% sure that legalizing substances with a much higher dependence potential than alcohol wouldn't lead to similar effects.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And if they want to get rid of their addiction they can directly ask the pharmacist for help.

If drugs become legal we should make sure that people wouldn't develop an addiction in the first place. Read drug addicts stories, who try to find a way out of their addiction and you'll see that we talk about horrendous situations. So no, if legalization leads to addiction and making people severely sick, that's a complete failure and is totally unacceptable.",,/r/europe/comments/bmvidq/berlin_parks_drug_dealing_zones_spark_outrage/en3skf3/,JustAPasserByGuy,1557568763

For some drugs we actually now very little about there actual mechanisms of actions but we use them mainly based on statistics. For other drugs there are some proposed mechanisms of action, but still we don't have a full understanding of it. We use them too.

1. Red car owners swear to other drivers 100% more frequently.
2. As the consequences are not severe we don't ban red color cars, but it's certainly interesting to monitor and analyze the situation.

Scenario 2:

1. Red car owners murder other people 1000x times more frequently than the general population. Beyond doubt that's statistically significant. 
2. We impose a temporary ban for as long as needed to collect data and analyze it. We know ho much red car owners have increased the murder rate in the country, so we expect a similar fall in the given time.
3. If there is a fall similar to the expected one, then definitely we maintain the ban.
4. At the same time we investigate in order to find the cause.
5. If for example the investigation concludes that it's not the color, but substance X that was in red paints, then we unban red colors, but we maintain ban on substance X, allowing manufacturing of red colors with alternative material.
6. If we can't find a cause we maintain the ban on red paints for cars. A very small price to pay, in order to avoid the horror of murder many families would have to deal with.",,/r/europe/comments/bmvidq/berlin_parks_drug_dealing_zones_spark_outrage/en3ll8g/,JustAPasserByGuy,1557561830

ISIS were found to have used rockets that had been bought, delivered, used and disposed of and left  on the battlefields within eight weeks of manufacture. 

The idea that the west is anti isis when it was clearly arming the cunts doesn't make sense. Like almost every other conflict since the late seventies when the jihadi international have turned up, they have fought for the same interests the west did, the west has armed them and supplies them, in this case they fought russian/Iranian aligned Assad.

Among these organizations are Hezbollah, Hamas, the GIA, Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, Al-Shabaab, Ansar al-Sunna and Ansar al-Islam. In 2010, the Swedish Security Service estimated that a total of 200 individuals were involved in the Swedish violent Islamist extremist milieu. According to the Swedish Defence University, most of these militants were affiliated with the Islamic State, with around 300 people traveling to Syria and Iraq to join the group and Al-Qaeda associated outfits like Jabhat al-nusra in the 2012-2017 period[16] and some have financed their activities with funds from the Swedish state welfare systems.[17] In 2017, Swedish Security Service director Anders Thornberg stated that the number of violent Islamic extremists residing in Sweden to number was estimated to be ""thousands"".[18]",Frankenland,/r/europe/comments/bn492i/opinion_the_swedish_state_refuses_to_acknowledge/en2vhr4/,weneedabetterengine,1557541493

3709,"Wow, there is a lot of bitterness in this comment. 

&gt; The ""too literal"" excuse again. What is written is not true, and what is not written is true, I guess? 

That is incredibly far from what I said, I merely state that what is written is not always the gist of it. 

&gt; First of all, remember that this is Europe, not America. You don't get sued for everything. If you run your local forum and someone upload a picture that has copyright on it, you can not get sued immediately. When a big company tries that the judge will simply throw it out and tell you to work it out amongst yourselves. 

Far from true. While you will rarely get sued as an individual, the EU is notorious for suing big companies (especially foreign ones). While I am thankful for the institution's stance on monopolies, this is not the area where you push back since it will hurt the individual. Also, why would they throw the lawsuit out? If it is the intention of the directive to try to protect copyright, why would they ignore an instance where it could be implemented?

&gt; Companies leaving the economic area, as you said, is not real. Google News would be exceptionally weird, since they already comply with the Directive without making any changes. 

What do you mean by it not being real? Google News is run on the premise that it shows shortened articles of other news sites (without paying them of course). Due to the new legislation, however, it is entirely possible that it is no longer viable to operate inside of the EU since it would shift the spending to income ratio. Another huge problem is the fact that many medium-sized companies, or small but up and coming businesses might have to look towards Asia or other booming markets due to these regulations. I'm not even going to start on the polarizing effect on the markets.

&gt; The excuse that current standards are inadequete so it's not possible is ridiculous. If you keep that train of thought, you'll never improve on anything.  Thinking you need a perfect filters adds to the insanity and makes the rest of your point moot. 

It's not ridiculous, it's realistic. Frankly, the filters are never going to be *adequate* until they are operated by AI with knowledge of syntax, advanced image recognition, and judgment. Until then there will be inevitable and quite abundant collateral damage.

&gt; I'll give you a real-life example: there are copyright laws right now. Do you need to get all your content checked, even though you're liable? Are you covered in lawsuits? Of course not. Don't make up fantasy worlds. 

Please cut down on the snarkiness. ""Don't make up fantasy worlds."" Such passive-aggressivity. As I've duly noted, it is not individuals who will be sued, it is the service providers. If a user on one of their platforms posts something that is copyrighted, the copyright holder then has a chance to sue the provider. There is quite a difference between me misusing copyrighted materials, and multibillion-dollar corporations doing the same thing. Especially in the possible gain in capital for the copyright holder.

This is how it is in r/politics, r/news, r/worldnews where you pick the absolute best of the best Europe has to offer in said country or town and you compare it to the WHOLE of the United States or the very worst of the US. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did smile when I saw the pick though lol.. their drinks in the States are FUCKING INSANE. It's not a myth, they are fucking batshit crazy huge. If you're middle class in western Europe, you go there.. well you're middle class too so you'll probably go to middle class places to eat and see their food portions and drink sizes. USA waste 40% of all it's food, there has never been a country in known human history to waste so much.

I don't wish to give you more trouble. Just a last thought. You can minimize the damage to to other countries by adopting friendly and non violent foreign affairs. That really should be an obligation for every country.

&amp;#x200B;

But you can't sacrifice other people in order to save others. For example: There are millions of people dying in Africa because of famine. If a German chancellor decides that German people should take their place, is that acceptable? Lets say that a chancellor in the future decides that Germans should give all their resources, their houses, their money and food to African people that die because of famine and die instead of them. How is that ethical and fair?

You can take that decision for yourself if you wish, but you can't force your neighbors and their families to die, they are innocent people too. If you force them to die in the place of another family in some other place in Germany or in the world, that still murder, not philanthropy.

This resulted in dozens of foreigners walking around the festivals collecting cups, pretty much staring you down when you were finishing your beer. It was annoying as hell. Then they'd hand them in, get a bunch of tokens, and keep doing that for the entirety of the festival, then handing in all their tokens for cash. This cost the festival thousands of euros.

Since competences between EU and member states are pretty mixed, governments promise certain things in national elections and will have to affectuate that on the European level. How do you do shared competences if governments have no say in EU law anymore. It'd be a cluster fuck.

There is nothing undemocratic about your government representing you in the council. Germany has a similar system. In the UK you vote a representative per parliamentary constituency, that is pretty comparable (a geographic area sending one representative).

The council is literally a democratic as your government. Do you directly elect a health minister?

Maybe you think that this is a decision which should be taken solely by the executive, but people generally approved of parliament getting a say through a meaningful vote, it seemed more democratic and looked like it would make the government more accountable (I suppose we can conclude that it did).

But parliament is highly bifurcated, and MPs feel comfortable voting in a highly political way because there don't appear to be any \*immediate\* ramifications and there are very legitimate reasons to oppose the Withdrawal Agreement cooked up by the Commission.

3982,"&gt;chose to put in an unnecessary and demeaning label for an entire demographic.

I didn't intend to offend an entire demographic at all, I have a lot of good things to say about Ukrainians, and there was nothing about any demographics in my comment, I was talking about a geopolitical value of Ukraine as a country to the West. What I did was describing a situation from the point of view of the West, how I see it. We can talk about fantasy ideals or we can talk about how decisions in politics are made in real world. In real world geopolitical decisions are based on value. Value of Ukraine for Russia is high, wile for the West it's low. What the West sees is a lot of problems and not a lot of benefits. I can list them later if needed, don't want to make comment too long.

Main value of Ukraine to the West (more precisely to the US) is to use it as a tool to weaken Russia. But they already achieved that goal. The current conflict already creates a lot of long term problems for Russia. So why would US escalate military side further risking a real confrontation with 2nd or 3rd strongest army in the world? So they will just keep conflict as it is, not resolve it and not escalate it, because it's already in a perfect spot. And what's even the benefit of succeeding? What will they do to Ukraine, make it part of EU? EU doesn't need additional 40 million poor by it's standards country to sustain and with huge problems with corruption to fix. It might sound harsh, but it is what it is. EU already has more countries than it can handle. It can barely sustain a 10 mil Greece, what will it do with a 40 mil unintegrated country that would be a constant source of problems with Russia?

You say about highly educated people, that's very true, but some of the best of them will migrate to EU anyways, just like you did, there is no need to take the whole country as a member to reap all of the benefits.

&gt;MAD or mutually assured destruction was a consensus and nukes were out of the Q 

If NATO starts escalating than Russia will escalate in return. At some point it can go to a hot phase, and what will they do next? One thing is bombing for oil out of existence third world countries that can only shoot back with AKs against stealth bombers, and the other thing is messing with a great power with nukes on it's border for a benefit that is very unclear.",,/r/europe/comments/bmvow4/ukrainian_journalist_vadim_komarov_beaten_into/en1r8bf/,lncognitoErgoSum,1557517450

4016,"&gt;Still, the fact remains that the EU can not control how things are produced in other countries, so all that is irrelevant. Those other countries’ governments have to deal with that.

The EU cannot control how things are produced but they can control what, and how much, they choose to purchase. It is worth considering national GHG emissions both in terms of location of production and location of consumption. This is because goods are produced with the express purpose of being used, so only looking at the supply side of the issue is missing out on an important part of the story.

According to an [Oxfam report](https://www-cdn.oxfam.org/s3fs-public/file_attachments/mb-extreme-carbon-inequality-021215-en.pdf) the wealthiest 10% of the global population consume 49% of all GHG emissions. This group of people consists primarily of the populations of North American and Europe. Moreover, within each country you see a roughly similar distribution, with a small fraction of the wealthiest accounting for the majority of GHG consumption.

This suggests that it isn't just to require developing nations to bear the financial burden of reducing their production emissions so that developed nations can continue their over-sized consumption of the world's resources.",,/r/europe/comments/bmv7r0/emissions_of_the_eu_fell_by_25_from_2017_to_2018/en1rvi3/,inky1729,1557517811

Well, it can’t revolve around Europe as I wasn’t born in Europe, so that would be weird. In my personal passport ranking system it would be number of visitors with the exception of some regional traffic, as regional traffic like HK/Mainland China (that’s why I gave China as an example) does not show the value of a passport, as it’s not tourism, it’s small scale business or even just family visits, so they are irrelevant for most passport holders. Same with KSA. The Hajj is relevant only for Muslims, so not at all for 75 percent of the population (this is theoretical though as Saudi wants visas from everyone except GCC countries, but still). 

I don’t see anything Europe Centric in this at all. I just gave examples outside of Europe as they were easier. European examples of countries with a lot foreign visits that don’t matter are harder, due to open Schengen borders and those visits not being counted among foreign tourists for many countries, so say a BeNeLux commute would not be counted, a HK to Shenzen one would be, which makes China’s and HK’s stats inflated.

As all the [polls show](https://i.imgur.com/OziMzXu.png), most of the people that are against independence are old people with no higher education. Their arguments are usually sentimental or nationalistic. Like ""I have family living in Spain"" or ""I like the Spanish Monarchy"" or Spain must be united because that's what they have seen for all their life. Most of them are right-wing.

Meanwhile, those supporting independence are the young generations with higher studies. They always tend to list rational and tangible reasons, such as: ensure separation of powers, more rights for the citizens, ensure protection of Catalan language, economy, decentralization and a modern Republic, removing the old and corrupt structures of the Spanish Kingdom. Most of them are left-wing.

It's easy to see in polls how those supporting independence are more in favor of immigration and solidarity with the lower close (contirbute more to help them), than those who don't support independence.

4239,"&gt;Any talk of direct democracy that isn't about getting not just popular, but sustaintable and effective results, is simply ego-stroking.  

How can you predefine sustainable results? That's something you can only observe retrospectively. For example you can read many opinions for Brexit that range for it being a doomsday event to a not very damaging event for great Britain's economy. My opinion is that the truth is somewhere in the middle.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And even then, yes/no referendum are just the FPTP of direct democracy,  inherently flawed to the point that ""popularity"" of the decision is a  meaningless metric, as we can see with the Brexiter civil war. Direct  Democracy doesn't need more trials, it needs more theory.

&amp;#x200B;

Direct democracy shouldn't only mean voting in questions that have binary options. People should vote in the same or similar manner MPs vote during lawmaking process. The Brexit war continues by MPs who are part of a representative government by the way. If Britain had direct democracy we would have already reached a conclusion. I don't know if that would be a good or bad conclusion, but there wouldn't be constant request of extensions and more deliberations. That's what political parties have caused and I think it would be different in the case of direct democracy. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Now maybe now is the time of Direct Democracy, and we can finally make  it practical, but like I said, recent events say otherwise. We even have  had one referendum in the UK where the public voted against better  representation, and an event in Turkey where the public voted in favour  of more central control.

&amp;#x200B;

If Corbs does a deal with the tories he will be partly owning Brexit, why would he put his name on it when the Tories are destroying themselves and taking all the blame?

We must also be careful in attributing success and failure based solely on a political ideology - we have to look at the factors that directly lead to the failure of a state and then see if those factors arose from the socialism.

In reality, the failures are due to an over-reliance on Oil, corruption, and interferance from the USA. 

You also have to ask questions like ""What are the things that define socialism?"" and then see which of those things did Venezuela fulfill. Did workers own the means of production, was the country democratic, and so on and so on.

&gt;  
&gt;Ireland  
&gt;  
&gt; who insisted that there should be no hard border, the UK simply reassured them that it wouldn't happen (as did the European Commission).

No, that would be the Good Friday agreement that ended decades of extreme violence. You've brought up the minutia of the negotiations that took place *after* you voted to leave as evidence of some kind of bad faith in trying to fix a literally impossible situation caused by the vote to leave.

&gt;Instead of looking to solve a difficult issue through creativity and compromise, the EU gave the UK the option of no brexit at all, or no deal.

Wait, what? May said multiple times that she got the deal she wanted and she made you vote on it three times. A highly complex deal where you got everything the leave vote wanted and a unicorn for the Irish situation.

But let's get to the crux of your complaint:

&gt;Believe it or not, the EU negotiators did not conduct everything in good faith. Their intention was to punish and/or humiliate the UK from the very beginning. You have to be an idiot not to realise that this was their main strategy.

Sincerely, I can understand why someone in the UK would feel this way after this long and hard slog you've had, and I do sympathize. I have many friends and colleagues in the UK, some of whom are highly intelligent and voted to leave (although all of them now regret that).

But equally you must admit that from a European perspective you are leaving us. It will cost us economically and has already cost us politically when frankly there are far more important issues facing the EU now that the UK has decided to leave. We've given nearly everything you asked for, extended the negotiations several times and extended the entire Brexit several times after *you* had set the date(s). **We are even letting you vote in the European parliamentary elections when you are certain to elect die hard EU saboteurs!**

*""Among other signs of poor press health, it cited the Trump administration’s curtailment of White House briefings; the revocation of CNN reporter Jim Acosta’s White House press pass; the banning of a second CNN reporter, Kaitlan Collins, from an open-media event; and the harassment of journalists at Trump's reelection rallies. Beyond this, there were bomb threats made to newsrooms; an alleged murder plot aimed at prominent media figures and Democratic politicians by a Coast Guard lieutenant; and increased security measures in newsrooms nationwide.*

*It noted that 'hatred of the media' reached the point where a gunman killed four journalists and another employee at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis in June.*

*'Amid one of the American journalism community’s darkest moments, President Trump continued to spout his notorious anti-press rhetoric, disparaging and attacking the media at a national level,' it said. 'Simultaneously, journalists across the country reported terrifying harassment and death threats, online and in person, that were particularly abusive toward women and journalists of color.'""*

I suppose my only proof would be a bulk buying example. If I want to buy 1 pair of Levi’s and Amazon wants to buy 1,000, they will pay a cheaper price. Maybe you can prove me wrong and there’s some company willing to pay more than an individual consumer. I’d be interested to find out why. 

Countries on the other hand will sometimes break this pragmatic business action because they aren’t always going for straight profits. Influence, relaxed border controls, initiative support, etc. are sometimes more critical needs. 

When China and New Zealand signed the FTA in 2008, their today famous brands were largely unknown in the West. This was another potential door into the Western market and an opportunity to build regional prestige with neighbors, a soft power essential. 

Of course, if China and the West begin competing to hold sway over the U.K., it might be a great financial opportunity, but in this case, the country would probably become something of a client state for whichever giant “wins.” Sovereignty would certainly be strangled in ways currently incomparable to the currently testy EU-U.K. relationship.

4517,"No I did not. I'm calling out the statement that deviation from the norm is somehow bad even if most people in a region is fine with LGBTQ+ people. The original commenter said that since they're not ""normal"" i.e the larget plurality, then they are forced \[for a politcal agenda\]. I then take that to it's logical conclusion in that any devation from the plurality no matter what is forced. As Chinese people are the largest people group in the world and therefore have the plurality then it must stand to reason that Chinese people are the only people allowed in advertisements.

I stand by the comparison but I do think it'd be better to compare the redhead in the Polish ad. 1,6% of Polish people are redheads, they're clearly not representative of a plurality, but they're not called forced. Why aren't they called 'forced' but gay people are. I am not surprised that it's called forced because people are stupid, but I find it stupid precisely because the appeal to normality is only limited to sexual orientation and not other parts of the population.

4523,"I actually have a bigger problem with this map.  
Ok, let's make it relative gains. How? By making a map of ""per capita welfare gains from trade boosting effect *adjusted for national median income*"". Sounds good? It isn't, because then you run into the problem, as there is still the problem of countries being more dependent on trade than others.  
So you could have two countries, beneffited equally by the Single Market. For one, trade is 30% of income and for the other it's 3%. Then obviously, the gain will be smaller for the latter, without it being the fault of the Single Market.  
Then there is also the problem of Countries having different welfare programs. If, say, Germany were to slash its welfare, then it would show on this new relative map as having gained nothing, simply because welfare would *be* nothing relative to median income.  
Then the peculiarity of this map being of NUTS regions. It should have been obvious from the beginning why this is a problem: Welfare is national and depends of the economic performance of all regions, so you can't say ""the Bucharest-Ilfov region benefitted from X"". Maybe that X is lower, because all the other regions have a much worse performance.  
  

Actually, **why is this even a map of welfare?** I you wanted to know how much the Single Market benefits trade, *wouldn't you look at trade directly, instead of looking at how individual countries distribute the gains from trade?*
  
What I'm trying to say is that this map is probably one of those 1000s of figures and numbers and statistics that Eurostat has that were meant for a very specific context. This looks more like a map about how different countries have been able to use the benefits of being in the Single Market to benefit their citizens, including those from the regions not primarily affected by growth (because notice it shows welfare, the wealth that the nation distributes to people not in the economy, not *income*, the wealth that is actually generated at the source, like ports or cities or factories), **it's not about how the Single Market is more or less beneficial for different people**.  
  
A proper map on this subject would be ""percentage increase in trade for each country"". But then you get into the problem that analysts had with calculating this for Britain: it's impossible to really know how much trade happens because of the Single Market. We know it's a lot, but we can't even ballpark a number for *a nation*, let alone NUTS regions.",May Europe stand together,/r/europe/comments/bmvjb9/per_capita_welfare_gains_from_the_trade_boosting/en0511l/,TheDigitalGentleman,1557481933

4565,"Over-consumption creates great problems too. Over-consumption refers to the creation and fulfillment of artificial needs and luxuries.

Anti-consumerism does not mean to abandon our modern societies and return to the caves. There are still many basic needs that will maintain the market and feed families.

For example:

* We need housing: That means job positions for engineers, builders, electricians, plumbers etc.
* We need transport for people and goods: That means heavy industry that produces airplanes, cars, ships, trains and jobs for engineers and workers for the creation and maintenance of infrastructures like airports, roads, ports, railway trucks.
* We need means of communication: landlines and mobile networks.
* We need food which also supports a huge industry.
* We need healthcare: doctors and drugs and medical machines and equipment.
* We need clothing.

&amp;#x200B;

There are numerous basic needs that will keep the market running.

&amp;#x200B;

With over-consumption the problems are the following:  


 

&gt;The Living Planet Report found that high-income countries have an **ecological footprint on average five times that of low-income ones**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Across the globe the footprint has doubled since 1966.  
**""We are living as if we have an extra planet at our disposal,"" said Jim Leape, WWF International director general.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
**""We  are using 50 percent more resources that the Earth can  sustainably  produce and unless we change course, that number will grow  fast -- by  2030 even two planets will not be enough.""**

But, in the meanwhile he also funneled a lot of money to friends, cut back on powers of the constitutional court and the juries en bloc, started several propaganda channels, incited hostility against refugees, started an offensive rhetoric against the EU just because they wanted him to cut back on corruption, started messing around with NGOs specialising in corruption and international aid and started improving ties with China, Turkey and Russia.

There are basically two groups on reddit: those who forget the first column and those who forget the second. The latter is in clear minority. It's a complex issue, especially if you take the context, which is the opposition consists of several parties, out of whom most never governed anything, not even a town, and those who did fucked up the country so bad, misgovernance is a euphemism for them.

4638,"A VW E-Golf looks exactly like a normal Golf.

Talking about the E-Golf (and electric cars in general)  Boy is it fun to drive. I exited the parking-spot with screeching tires the first time i drove it because i didn't expect this performance. Unlike petrol or diesel the millisecond you put your foot on the pedal, the car accelerates. And it just keeps accelerating. And when you remove your foot from the pedal the way you coast is also great, as if you lose no energy at all.

All points besides the last one should be true for all electric vehicles. With the coasting characteristics there are huge differences between the different manufacturers, depending on how much recuperation is active. Some cars you can drive with essentially 1 pedal, as soon as you let go of the gas the car will break. The Golf is opposite of that, to break you have to break. It feels like there is no recuperation at all (there is, but only if you use the break)

And here's the thing, i would never buy a normal Golf, because it is a boring car. But how it drove was so fun i was hard considering to buy it, but the price was still to high. But if it were cheaper but a giant ugly duck, i would have likely bought it.

So in short, just drive a few EVs. You might come to the conclusion that you have enough fun driving them that you actually don't care how it looks on the outside. After all, you don't buy a car to impress other people (unless you're rich), you buy one to have fun driving it while most likely driving from home to work or vice versa.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/bmjnvu/change_in_co2_emissions_in_2018_compared_to_2019/emzzieu/,Alcobob,1557475193

What Serbia does is the closest you can come to neutrality, by dealing with both sides and using that as leverage. If Ukraine did the same rather than flip-flopping they'd probably be in a better place.


If you put all your trust in Russia, western countries will be against and vice versa. They really couldn't give less of a shit prior to shit going down between Ukraine and Russia. This is observable even in public discourse like on this subreddit, where Ukraine became God's favorite child overnight.


Now you've got no choice but to look to the west, who have your full confidence. They aren't a bit worried, they don't care, which is why for the past few years their support has been the warfare equivalent of sending thoughts and prayers on social media. They give more of a shit about Syria than Ukraine, unfortunately for Ukraine.

Furthermore, you're talking about this from a Ukrainian standpoint. Yes, I know what's going down in Ukraine, but do you know what went down in Serbia 20 years ago? Serbia will have to rely on someone because she's too small on her own, but we sure won't give our full confidence to one side or another and become a pawn in their political game. Others have different views, but that's probably because they didn't have western powers taking turns bombing them in favor of a terrorist organization a mere 20 years ago.

Oh please. Complete and total projection - you're the one casually throwing in lies about pensions and how they ""killed as many people"" as the war itself. 

&gt;as far as Donbass is concerned - I think you vastly overestimate the ability of elderly pensioners to complete this kind of a trip, especially considering the lines and the length of travel required.

The alternative is to send millions directly to your enemy and hope that they actually distribute it all to pensioners. That's not how wars work. Also, the occupying force is ultimately responsible for the people it occupies. In Donbass, that is Russia, so the blame for the suffering (lack of food, medical supplies, heating, etc) lies squarely with them.

The rest of your laughable attempts to cast Russia's invasion of Donbass as anything other than what it is, a war of aggression perpetrated by Russia, are uninteresting. You live in some alternate reality where invasions are ""civil wars"", so be it. Reminds me of stories by buddy from Austria used to tell me about elderly people in his small town, who used to rehash conspiracy theories about how Hitler was essentially just a victim of bad PR. Even 30-40 years after the war ended, in their minds there were still a million little excuses why their Adolf wasn't *that* bad. You Putin fanboys will be telling your grandkids the same tall tales decades from now about how you didn't *really* support a war of aggression that killed 13000+ people, it was all a civil war you see.

4886,"The Britons were a Celtic people - the Greek name “Prettanoi,” attested as far back as the 4th century B.C. and the earliest written name for them, may be derived for the Britons’ name for themselves. However, “Romano-British” is the common historical term for the population of southern Britain at the time of 450 A.D. It’s pretty accurate, imo - Britain was a milieu of Celtic and Roman customs and language throughout the Roman era. By 450, Rome had abandoned Britannia, but many institutions of the Roman era were still struggling on. This would change over the next two centuries as Saxon migrations (possibly invasions), and the eventual adoption of Saxon customs by the British population, led to radical cultural change.

The people who would come to be known as “Welsh” would have been indistinguishable from other Romano-Britons in 450, but they maintained these traditions while the land that became England following the migration period did not (e.g. the early Welsh never converted back to Paganism, maintained trade ties with the Mediterranean, and still spoke a Celtic language). Essentially, the areas of southern Britain which became Wales and Cornwall were just the areas that did not adopt Anglo-Saxon culture and remained predominantly Celtic.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/bmm7nv/europe_450_ad/emzaj00/,Keyserchief,1557454066

In the 5th and 6th centuries, the Antes were located in the territory of what is now Ukraine. The Antes were the ancestors of Ukrainians: White Croats, Severians, Polans, Drevlyans, Dulebes, Ulichians, and Tiverians. Migrations from Ukraine throughout the Balkans established many Southern Slavic nations. Northern migrations, reaching almost to the Ilmen lakes, led to the emergence of the Ilmen Slavs, Krivichs, and Radimichs, the groups ancestral to the Russians. After an Avar raid in 602 and the collapse of the Antes Union, most of these peoples survived as separate tribes until the beginning of the second millennium.[34]

Golden Age of Kiev
Main article: Kievan Rus'

The baptism of the Grand Prince Vladimir led to the adoption of Christianity in Kievan Rus'.
Kievan Rus' was founded by the Rus' people, who came from Scandinavia across Ladoga and settled in Kiev around 880 AD. Kievan Rus' included the central, western and northern part of modern Ukraine, Belarus, far eastern strip of Poland and the western part of present-day Russia. According to the Primary Chronicle the Rus' elite initially consisted of Varangians from Scandinavia.[35]

During the 10th and 11th centuries, it became the largest and most powerful state in Europe.[36] It laid the foundation for the national identity of Ukrainians and Russians.[37] Kiev, the capital of modern Ukraine, became the most important city of the Rus'.””",,/r/europe/comments/bmm9ss/march_of_fallen_ukranian_soldiers_mothers_crimean/emzcjtj/,therealmaeunu,1557455268

1.6 million tonnes of PET bottles were collected in 2011 \[...\], 1.12 million tons of PET flake were produced. 440,000 tons were used to produce fibres, 283,000 tons to produce more bottles, 278,000 tons to produce APET sheets, 102,000 tons for strapping tape and 18,000 tons for miscellaneous applications.

so only  17% are re-used to make bottle (and i think they add new virgin pellet in it to do so), and the other use won't be able to be reclycled (because they are not bottle anymore and so can't be collected &amp; sorted easily). Why?

5028,"Ad 1. The people that live in parts of Ukraine under Russian ""occupation"" (annexation, really), that is - in Crimea, don't have any reason to worry about Ukrainian pensions at all since they have much higher Russian pensions. And as far as Donbass is concerned - I think you vastly overestimate the ability of elderly pensioners to complete this kind of a trip, especially considering the lines and the length of travel required.

Ad 2. I'm not talking of starvation. I'm talking of preventable diseases (lack of medicine) and just general stress from poor nutrition (extreme poverty) and cold (money!).

And, furthermore - I was actually not naming anyone at all here. I avoided assigning blame or mentioning any particular sides whatsoever, but I guess, since you insist...

Russia has **less** to do with this conflict than (for example) Britain has with Syrian Civil War. They have definitely provided weapons to the rebels, volunteers from Russia have been part of the rebel armies from the start (same as there were volunteers even from Belarus on the other side, for some reason), and it seems very likely based on the outcomes and various other facts, that regular forces have supported the rebels in few instances during the major events of the conflict - ie. Debaltsevo, Illovaysk, capture of Novoazovsk, etc. Basically, it must have happened, because I don't see any other reason why a force that was outnumbered and in constant retreat could suddenly encircle and destroy the much larger and better supplied army opposing them.

**All** these things considered - it's still *obnoxious, exaggerated,* and *completely false* to claim that the Ukrainian Civil War, or War in Donbass, or Donbass Rebellion (call it whatever you want) could possibly be described as a Russian occupation. The facts are just strongly against you. If this was the case - you'd have at least similar amount of captured Russian servicemen to Ukrainian citizens (the real ratio is considerably under 1%), and there would be no successful early offensives that have brought the Ukrainian army to the brink of Donetsk. 

Let me present you with a decent, contemporary analogy: Syrian Civil War is not Russian-NATO War, even though Americans/Turks are serving the same function in the last rebel stronghold as Russians are in DNR/LNR - not letting the rebels be totally snuffed out (for whatever reason). Do you hear **anyone**, even Syrians, claiming that they're fighting the war against Americans? In effect - they kind of are (since they could win if they'd be allowed to), in the same way as Ukraine probably could. Yet in both cases the central government is fighting a civil war against rebels, who form the (by far) primary force that keeps the resistance going.

5029,"&gt;the separatists were entirely created by Russia

Is it really that unfathomable to believe that Ukraine’s russian minority would revolt when a staunchly anti-Russian government took over after ousting the previous pro-Russian one? Russia had more to do with arming the rebels with heavy weaponry and sending military advisors than actively participating itself in the fighting.

As for Russian volunteers, they are estimated to have made up only about 1/4th to 1/5th of the Novorossiyan forces at the height of the war in late 2014. As the fighting has died down, most of those have likely went back home. Also if you read about the military units involved it’s clear that while there were significant amounts of Russian volunteer units, most were composed of native Donbassians.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/bmm9ss/march_of_fallen_ukranian_soldiers_mothers_crimean/emyygh6/,CallousCarolean,1557446636

5039,"I spent some time reading through your post history and you don't seem like the kind of person I would have a problem with. We might have gotten off on the wrong foot due to differences in how we argue.

My thoughts on the romani issue is that it is a very complex problem that I don't have a good answer on how to solve. I do however know some methods that have prooved ineffective, financial assistance for example.

The problem is complicated for a number of reasons namely: 
1. The romani have a very conservative society where there is a resistance towards adopting foreign concepts. This makes them harder to integrate.
2. The romani is increadibly poor. One effect of this is that crime has been used as a means of survival. Multiply this with the fact that the romani has been shunned for hundereds of years and you get a culture where crime is so embedded in their history that it is the normal way to live.
3. They are a collective society, meaning that the community is very strong. The consequence of this is that the the individuals that don't want to live the romani way has a harder time breaking off and are in more cases brought back into the fold where they adapt.

And these are just some of the issues.

So far no one has found a good way to integrate these people, but believe me we have tried. We have nutjobs here that for real would invite ISIS fighters  into their homes in an attempt to bridge the gap. Those people have been trying with the romani for years and years, no progress.

I do however agree with you in that people let things go way out of control before acting.

5100,"&gt;Also, judging from your profile, you are Croatian, or something of the sort, which I'm sure also would provoke some anti-Austrian sentiment.

You do realise most Croatians blame Serbia for the war, and are more fond of Austria?  I'm simply anti-Empire and anti-bullying. 


&gt;To be honest, there is very little substance in this long copy-pasted paragraph. Germany and Austria were allies, which implies that one will help the other in their time of need (though they may not have been obliged to help Austria, it certainly makes sense that they would). In this context, declaring war on (or mobilizing against) Austria is not different from declaring war on Germany. 

So Russia had the right to defend Serbia since they guaranteed their independence?



&gt;This is not considering, that had Serbia allowed Austria to investigate the terrorist groups within their country that had caused the assassination, there wouldn't have been a war in the first place.

Serbia did allow a investigation to happen, but just not from Austria, they wanted Hague, a third party to do the investigation, but Austria refused. Austria set the ultimatum in a such way that would diminish Serbia's autonomy, and that's why Serbia had to decline, they would allow an investigation to happen but not on a illegal way, like the Austrian wanted.



All comes to Germany and it's blank cheque, no blank cheque no war, no Russian mobilisation, no invasion of France and Belgium and no German defeat. The assassination happened, but it was no justification for a war that killed 10 million people.",,/r/europe/comments/bm3kjs/on_this_day_germany_surrendered_to_the_allies/emyk7cu/,tdzida26,1557438380

1. Crimean war has ended over 150 years ago and it hasn't involved Ukraine. 
2. Current Crimean so called annexation has been performed by local voting without any blood (I am stating as I am from southern Ukraine, Nikolaev city). 
3. There's a bloodshed in eastern Ukraine though. But it's actually regular Ukrainian army who fights locals, dragged into it by neo fascism that prospers in modern Ukraine these days. If you don't believe me, just Google ""Neo fascism in Ukraine"" and you'll get the point. 
4. Yes, there's volunteers in eastern Ukraine who fights for the locals against the Ukrainian army. But they're not only Russians. There are lots of different nations there. And the same thing is on the other side.

We rented an apartment close to my parent's house (like 2 minutes away by foot, you probably spend more time waiting for the lift - 9 story building, 4 apartments per story, a single functioning lift). Rent is cheap for the kind of apartment: 2 bedroom, 4th floor with private box garage for €300. But then you have a 2h commute via public transit, daily, each way for my job. I managed to get carpooling with some collages, but that also manages to cost 3x more. On top of that, my girlfriend is unemployed.

Despite all that, I totally can't afford luxuries. Money is budgeted to the last cent. This month we overshot it because I broke a finger, and public health services still have some costs. Next month I'll have to budget in surprises like this one.

5257,"No and no.

Please do disagree with me, but if you do, use an actual argument. Instead of telling me i am wrong because you disagree with me, which is not an argument at all.

I am certainly in favor of taxes to pay for certain things within my country, military, infrastructure, and all the things we dont want to be profit driven (Police, Fire department, Justice System etc etc)

I find it very interesting you say ""you haven't studied shit"" meanwhile i was able to show you how taxes are bad for the people. I can even go further, if you wish to bring up taxes on companies.

Well where can a company get money from? Three places, shareholders/owners (who decides everything) or from their employees by lowering their wages, or from the people which chooses to buy their product. So what will we see?

As you impose a higher tax on the company, it will always strike back against the citizens, because all the rich people (shareholders and the owners) Invest all of their money back into the market again.

Now you might ask me why which is certainly a valid question without doubt, but lets say you have $1,000,000 dollars which you have earned. Well the inflation rate is at 2% which means your money is losing value by 2% per year, that makes you lose $20,000 a year alone only from inflation. So you want to make your money grow instead so you invest it into startup companies or companies you believe in, so you ""give"" money to them in the hope of making a profit.

Just take Venezuela as an example, it was a very rich country, and they voted for social democracy so Chavez won, he was not a good guy, first of all he took one hell of a lot of the taxpayers money and gave to his daughter through various ways (state contracts primarily which didnt have to be fullfilled) not only that, he hand picked Nicolas Maduro to be his successor. So when he died Nicolas Maduro took control of the country, he implemented state mandated prices of most products which had a horrible effect on their economy.

Imagine that you as a (lets say) farmer, you grow wheat, you sell that wheat to a grossist which in turns sell it to a store which sells wheat to you. So now you place a mandated price on wheat, either you place it too high so no one buys it and the people who grows wheat and the grossists goes out of business. Or you place it to low, so that you the wheat grower cant live on growing wheat anymore, the grossists cant make a price off of selling wheat and stores dont want wheat because they make no money selling it.

So the whole side of supply is disrupted, stores go empty or too full of overpriced products, which is exactly what happened in Venezuela.",,/r/europe/comments/bm6ysq/finland_looks_to_be_getting_a_leftwing_government/emxtvxr/,baronmad,1557424340

5519,"&gt; The trouble starts when you have arrived in the promised land. Now, for the first time, we have a generation of Europeans – let’s call them the 89ers – who have known nothing but a Europe of closely connected liberal democracies. Call it a European empire or commonwealth, if you will. To be sure, “Europe whole and free” remains an ideal, not a reality, for millions who live here, especially those who are poor, belong to a discriminated minority or seek refuge from across the Mediterranean. But we are closer to that ideal than ever before.


&gt; It would be a parody of middle-aged condescension to say “these young people don’t know how lucky they are!”. After all, younger voters are often more pro-European than older ones. But it would not be wrong to say that many 89ers who have grown up in this relatively whole and free continent do not see Europe as a great cause, the way 39ers and 68ers did. Why be passionate about something that already exists? Unless they have grown up in the former Yugoslavia or Ukraine, they are unlikely to have much direct personal experience of just how quickly things can all unravel, back to European barbarism. By contrast, many of them do know from bitter experience how life got worse after the financial crisis of 2008.

He is copying his idol Sultan Abdül Hamit II’s book, who also cancelled the first Turkish imperial parliament in 1877 after the victory of the progressive Turks, cause he saw his throne was in danger. Cancelling election results is a first in republican Turkey’s history but I still do not think this will lead to a civil war. Erdogan’s actions make him look weaket than ever, even to his own base, to whom Erdogan’s strong image was appalling. If Imamoglu wins again, Erdogan will fasten the process of his dissolution as inner-party rebels start making their voices heard now more than ever (frontiers being Former President Gül, and former MfA and PM Davutoğlu). If he manages to win this time, be it fair or through rigging, he will create a victim in public’s mind which will allow Imamoglu to get even stronger.

It amazes me how power corrupts mankind, he is literally doing the same mistakes Turkey’s secular establishment did to him which made him get stronger than ever in public image. 

Just like how secular establishment in 90s prevented Erdogan from participating, then from taking office, etc, which victimized him and made him get stronger each time among public, Erdogan is doing the very same to secular Imamoglu this time.

I think you have misunderstood it. The happiness report measures subjective well-being. It also tries to correlate the ""happiness"" with the indicators you mention, but that's just to try and explain it. The hapiness indicator is not an index of GDP, life expectancy etc.

Here's from the report:

&gt; Happiness score or subjective well-being (variable name ladder ): The survey measure of SWB is from the Dec 22, 2017 release of the Gallup World Poll (GWP), which covers the years from 2005 to 2017. Unless stated otherwise, it is the national average response to the question of life evaluations. The English wording of the question is “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?” This measure is also referred to as Cantril life ladder, or just life ladder in our analysis.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/bmga4n/the_happiest_countries_in_europe_2019/emwlki1/,Snaebel,1557395058

5697,"&gt;Forest Brothers were given amnesty after Stalin's death. That means compromise out of necessity.

Lol, seriously, what do they teach you in schools?  

&gt;By the early 1950s, the Soviet forces had eradicated most of the Forest Brother resistance. Intelligence gathered by the Soviet spies in the West and KGB infiltrators within the resistance movement, in combination with large-scale Soviet operations in 1952 managed to end the campaigns against them.

&gt;Many of the remaining Forest Brothers laid down their weapons when offered an amnesty by the Soviet authorities after Joseph Stalin's death in 1953

It wasn't out of necessity, it was basically capitulation by Forest Brothers after absolute majority of them were captured or killed.

Another thing I want and is diabolically opposed to FvD thinking, is wealth equality. FvD wants to solve this, like many right wing parties, by deregulating everything, as far as I have seen.

5706,"&gt; The [German Instrument of Surrender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Instrument_of_Surrender) was signed twice. An initial document was signed in [Reims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reims) on 7 May 1945 by [Alfred Jodl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Jodl) (chief of staff of the German [OKW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKW)) for Germany, [Walter Bedell Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bedell_Smith), on behalf of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, and [Ivan Susloparov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Susloparov), on behalf of the Soviet High Command, in the presence of French Major-General [François Sevez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Sevez) as the official witness. Since the Soviet High Command had not agreed to the text of the surrender, and because Susloparov, a relatively low-ranking officer, was not authorized to sign this document, the USSR requested that a second, revised, instrument of surrender be signed in Berlin. [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin) declared that the Soviet Union considered the Reims surrender a preliminary document, and Eisenhower immediately agreed with that. Another argument was that some German troops considered the Reims instrument of surrender as a surrender to the Western Allies only, and fighting continued in the East, especially in [Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague).

&gt;  source I used yesterday, and I don't think it was taken at the height of the movement so the percentage are underestimated.

So, the numbers are nothing at all like what you claimed, with only 17% of all left-wing voters expressing some sympathy for the movement (13% considering themselves ""somewhat close"" to its ideas, and just 4% ""very close""). Among green voters (EELV) the numbers are just slightly higher (14 and 5%, respectively) but considering that EELV struggles to get even 5% of the overall vote, you sould admit that your ""green voter sympathising with the Manif' pour Tous"" is, if not mythical, at least an exceedingly rare species. 5% of 5% equals 0.25% of the population, that is, 1/400th. The poll sample was just 1000 people...

More to the point, according to the opinion poll, similar numbers apply to those who identify as ""non-religious"" (12 % ""somewhat close"" and 5 % ""very close"" to the ideas of the ""Manif' pour Tous"", against 12% ""somewhat far"" and **48%** ""very far"").

Also, the detailed report refers to an earlier poll, taken in 2014 showing slightly higher overall support, but still nothing like what you claimed (only 15% ""very close"" and 16 % ""somewhat close"" among **all the population**). And [this other poll](https://www.ifop.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2839-1-study_file.pdf), from the same source (namely, the avowedly right-wing site atlantico.fr), shows that support for same-sex marriage remained quite steady above three-quarters among left-wingers during the whole movement (indeed, the movement seems to have *increased* support for same-sex marriage among left-wingers...)

5909,"my short understanding is: some differences are around priorities, economics, identity, and history 

Both appeal to younger people and both tend urban but Greens have more reach with “middle class”/more affluent backgrounds (competing with Kok for some votes). Both but *especially* Greens do well with higher educated.

Greens are environmentalists and very left on social issues but economically very heterogeneous, many are open to market-based solutions etc. Historically the Finnish blocs were socialist and non-socialist and Greens were neither—their ending up on the left side now is more because of social/cultural factors that have become more polarized 

Vas prioritizes economics more and is skeptical of market mechanisms. At this point the party is mostly environmentalist and socially progressive like Vihreät but that was of course not the case with its prior version (Skdl/Skp) (the communist party) and some of that older electorate in more rural parts of the country has remained through now. (Vas keeps increasing in cities but, for demographic reasons, decreasing in the old communist areas which makes it hard to pick up overall vote share)

5928,"&gt;I think I care more about them than you do in your demand for the right to spread hatred and incitement rather than information and opinion.

What you call hatred often is information. For example, Mohammed was a child rapist. This is important information. You call it hatred, most likely.

&gt;And how does that contradict what I've just said? 

You claimed the cause of anti mulsim sentiment is due to misinformation. But people tend to heavily overestimate muslim contributions to society, not underestimate it. That means misinformation runs into the opposite direction - people have positive stereotypes of muslim compared to their  on average dreadful social statistics. Mostly due to people being afraid to point out obvious defects. 

&gt;Leaving aside, of course, that this study is about opinions in Denmark, whose population is less xenophobic than other European countries.

Denmark is pretty typical for this. Other countries have similar deranged overestimates of muslim contributions to societies.

&gt;Says the right-winger. Well, thanks to the free German press leaking AfD chat logs, we already know what the extremists would like to do once they are in power.

Nothing as violent as the current government does, subverting the free expression of millions. 

&gt;Riiight, that's why we've seen that spike in hate speech, populism and harassment. 

Almost all crime is at an all time low. Your spike is typical left wing self enabling for political violence.

&gt;But of course the political left is ""nasty"" and ""violent"".
