5,"To some extent it was.  https://www.britannica.com/event/Union-of-Lublin

&gt; July 1, 1569, the Union of Lublin was concluded, uniting Poland and Lithuania into a single, federated state, which was to be ruled by a single, jointly selected sovereign. Formally, Poland and Lithuania were to be distinct, equal components of the federation, each retaining its own army, treasury, civil administration, and laws; the two nations agreed to cooperate with each other on foreign policy and to participate in a joint Diet. But **Poland, which retained possession of the Lithuanian lands it had seized, had greater representation in the Diet and became the dominant partner**. 

&gt;The dominant Lithuanian magnates, however, feared that a merger would diminish their power and blocked the proposal as well as subsequent initiatives. When representatives from both countries at a meeting of the Sejm (legislature) at Lublin (January 1569) failed to reach an accord, Sigismund II annexed the Lithuanian provinces of Podlasie and Volhynia (including the regions of Kiev and Bracław), which together constituted over one-third of Lithuania’s territory.

34,"&gt;He's probably **dreaming** that Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was actually a ""Polish"" Empire.

It was much more of a Polish empire than the Grand Dutchy of Samogitia, Lithuania, and Ruthenia was a ""Lithuanian"" Empire. It was a terretory under the Polish sphere of influence that still had certian atonomy. Even places in inside Poland had certian atonomy. And coupled with Polonisation it had aspects of empirialism. Not all empires forcebly conquored thier terretories. Not even the Ottomans fully incorporated all terretories into the Empire. Poland decided to annex 1/3 of the Grand Dutchies terretory before the Union of Lublin to make sure Lithuanis would be dependant on Poland, even  as early as after the death of Vytautas the Great they decided to anex border regions. This speaks volumes about the Poles relationship to Lithuanias.

Where did you get this ridiculous idea?

&gt; The origins of the first Cossacks are disputed, though the 1710 Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk claimed Khazar origin.[nb 2] The emergence of Cossacks is dated to the 14th or 15th centuries, when two connected groups emerged, the Zaporozhian Sich of the Dnieper and the Don Cossack Host.[nb 3] [[wiki]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossacks)


Cossacks were a mix of many Turkic steppe tribes and what we now call [Southern] Ukrainians, who, in turn, were also a mix of what we now call Moldavian, Russian, Bulgarian, various tribes from all around the Black Sea etc etc. 

Granted, the Russian poor, mostly runaway serfs / fugitives, were  flocking to the steppes in big numbers, but saying that they had somehow formed the Cossacks is a stretch.",Minas Morgul,/r/europe/comments/9mxw50/britain_has_been_moscows_enemy_since_ivan_the/e7k4hvo/,zurfer75,1539234781

There is a nice study made later by the US about a potential conflict with China over Taiwan that comes to similar conclusions:

https://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/files/2008_RAND_Pacific_View_Air_Combat_Briefing.pdf

The Raptor is a fantastic and impressive aircraft, but it was build under the wrong assumptions and under a questionable tactical doctrine that may not be valid in a true conflict. Not to mentiont hat the projected Raptor is not the Raptor delivered and current tech developments to counter stealth tech is underway and according to that RAND Report likely to achieve a level of performance that can considerably threaten the Raptors survival chances in a conflict.

The entire concept of exclusive BVR fighting is not proven by experience and the future validity is uncertain, as it relies on stealth (that might be countered or could be achieved by potential enemies as well, so they might not detect you, but you wont detect them either) and the asumption that the BVR missiles even work as expected.

For example during the 2012 Red Flag the Typhoons did not have the PIRATE tracking system equiped. The german wikipedia article gives numbers from 50km to 150km as possibilities and the Raptor is only stealthy against radar, not infrared tracking (*Big and Hot*).

Basically, because of these two levels, nearly-identical to the US and EU respectively, if the EU wanted to ""do a US"", it would pretty much be doing exactly what Canada does -- you'd expect that if you could get views in the EU on immigration to be pretty relaxed, that the beefs that people would have with immigration would be about what they are in Canada.

There was a paper from RAND I read from...2003 or 2005 I think, that was predicting that the EU would see a population shortfall down the road and that it would be politically-unacceptable in Europe to fully make up the shortfall with immigration, because of resistance to immigration.

1) Anglophone journalists, who can't seem to think in any terms except FPTP or presidentialism, and
2) the EPP, because they're the biggest party in Parliament, so it benefits them

In reality, it's just your classic parliamentarism - the post goes to the candidate that can get the majority of MEPs behind them. Being the biggest generally does mean that you're the closest to that goal - you need the least number of additional MEPs to build a coalition and reach the threshold, and you're going to be the biggest partner in any coalition you're a part of, thus being the likely leader. So it can be said, as a simplification, that the candidate of the biggest party is *most likely* to get the post (which is what this video says), but it's not any kind of actual rule.

So you posted a 5 year old article that probably was referencing tight, non-BVR rules of engagement that favored traditional dogfighting?

Because that's literally the only way the Typhoon with it's dinosaur radar wins against the F-22.

EDIT: Man, I called it without even reading the article

&gt;Indeed, Typhoon pilots at Farnborough said that, **when flying without their external fuel tanks, in the WVR (Within Visual Range) arena,** the Eurofighter not only held its own, but proved to be better than the Raptor.

&gt;Indeed, it looks like the F-22 tends to lose too much energy when using thrust vectoring (TV): TV can be useful to enable a rapid direction change without losing sight of the adversary but, unless the Raptor can manage to immediately get in the proper position to score a kill, the energy it loses makes the then slow moving stealth combat plane quite vulnerable.

&gt;This would be coherent by analysis made in the past according to which the TV it’s not worth the energy cost unless the fighter is in the post stall regime, especially in the era of High Off Bore Sight and Helmet Mounted Display (features that the F-22 lacks).",Third Rock from the Sun,/r/europe/comments/9n2eyy/the_eurofighters_typhoon_gripen_mirage/e7jq9kc/,WillitsThrockmorton,1539219024

Not really, that article is pretty light on the details. And as /u/WillitsThrockmorton points out there is a huge difference between within-visual-range (WVR) fighting and beyond-visual-range (BVR) fighting as this more [detailed article](https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/07/f-22-fighter-loses-79-billion-advantage-in-dogfights-report/) of the same training points out:

&gt;Two other German officers, Col. Andreas Pfeiffer and Maj. Marco Gumbrecht, noted in the same report that the F-22's capabilities are ""overwhelming"" when it comes to modern, long-range combat as the stealth fighter is designed to engage multiple enemies well-beyond the pilot's natural field of vision - mostly while the F-22 is still out of the other plane's range. **Grumbrecht said that even if his planes did everything right, they weren't able to get within 20 miles of the next-generation jets before being targeted.**

&gt;""But as soon as you get to the merge…"" Pfeiffer said, referring to the point at which fighters engage in close-up dogfighting, ""in that area, at least, the Typhoon doesn't necessarily have to fear the F-22 in all aspects… In the dogfight the Eurofighter is at least as capable as the F-22, with advantages in some aspects.""



While exciting for movies and air shows WVR ""dogfighting"" isn't very representative of modern air combat. That's not to suggest that the Typhoon is a bad plane because it's actually quite good. But the F-22 is almost twice the take-off weight, stealthy, and at least 50% more expensive.

Are you kidding me man?  How many half-remembered urban legends ""I heard from a guy"" are you going to produce as evidence?  What next, the M-16 is unreliable because 50 years go they didn't chrome the chamber?

Would you like to compare the kill ratios between  USN Phantoms and USAF Phantoms?

One service implemented realistic training(the USN) the dismal survival rate improved greatly, the other didn't(USAF) and the survival rate remained the same throughout the war.

Guess which service stuck with all-missile Phantoms and stayed BVR as much as possible and which one added a gun-pod to their Phantoms and ""yup yup gotta dogfight""?

http://aviationintel.com/in-response-to-reports-of-simulated-f-22-raptor-kills-by-german-eurofighters/

To quote the 2nd Link:
*The F-22 was robbed of its planned next generation helmet mounted sight during its later development and funding stages and the JHMCS apparently cannot be reworked to suit the Raptor’s unique needs, so the state-of-the-art Raptor still packs around AIM-9M Sidewinders which are incapable of high angle off bore-sight shots. The German Eurofighters on the other hand pack the highly capable and modern IRIS-T short-range (but longer than the Sidewinder series) missile. During a “turning fight” all the Eurofighter pilot has to do to kill their enemy is to maneuver the nimble fighter into a position where he or she can simply look at the bandit, even up to almost 90 degrees off the jet’s center axis, acquire a lock and fire. This means that almost the whole 180 degree frontal hemisphere of the highly maneuverable Typhoon is deadly, whereas at this time the F-22’s forward close in missile engagement envelope is much more narrow in comparison. Additionally, the IRIS-T has a far wider viewing area with its imagine infra-red sensor bore-sighted, thus the missile is much more capable than the AIM-9M even when not aided by a helmet mounted sight. The Raptor is finally slated to get a helmet mounted sighting system in the next couple of years which will allow it to carry the latest AIM-9X high off bore-sight imagining infra-red missile and employ it to its maximum potential, including a novel lock-on after launch capability. The long-awaited addition of the AIM-9X and helmet mounted sight to the F-22 weapon system, combined with the Raptor’s exiting thrust vectoring capability, should allow it to reliably vanquish anything within the close in air to air realm in the very near future.*

I am not up to date on developments of the Raptor since than, so if they fixed the mentioned lack of tech on the Raptor, this might play out different today.

383,"&gt;Polish law NEVER criminalized homosexuality in the first place.

&gt;Homosexuality was always legal in Poland.

Those two sentences on a surface level look like they mean the same thing, but they do not.

Yes, Polish law never criminalised homosexuality. However, the newly independent country didn't have its own laws until later and till then, German, Russian and Austrian laws were still in effect. In this case we're interested in penal law, and it's only in 1932 when Poland created it's own penal code. Between 1918 and 1932, the old penal codes were still in effect in the respective regions.

For example, homosexuality was illegal in Western Poland, because the German penal code was still in effect and section 175 penalised male homosexuality and bestiality within the same sentence. A quote [as of 1924](http://www.sbc.org.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=3970):

&gt;§175

&gt; Nierząd przeciwny naturze, popełniony przez osoby płci męskiej ze sobą, albo przez ludzi ze zwierzętami, ulega karze więzienia; można także orzec utratę obywatelskich praw honorowych. 

Similarly, the Russian law that was still in effect in Eastern Poland, criminalized pederasty with at least 3 month jail sentence. From the [Russian penal code as effective in 1921](http://www.bibliotekacyfrowa.pl/dlibra/publication/50138/edition/50650/content?ref=desc):

&gt;516\. Winny pederastji będzie karany: zamknięciem w więzieniu na czas nie krótszy od miesięcy trzech.

However, despite these laws, I haven't found a single instance of them being used to prosecute anyone.

(I also browsed the Austrian penal code and I haven't found anything, so I guess being gay and doing gay stuff was legal in Kraków and Lwów.)

All of them have mafia problems, corruption problems, having structural problems with economy, being nationalistic with tendency for populism mixed with authoritarianism. Nice cocktail producing dysfunctional countries unable to adapt in ever changing world. 


Poland also suffered from ""Slavic brotherhood"", which actually means Russian imperialism if you are too close, Serbia was always in sweet spot for Russian influence, they couldn't influence your country too much and take over. 

Ukrainians are not Russians, but there are Russians in Ukraine. How Ukrainians and Russians think individually? You need to check it out yourself. Russians force ""Little Russia"" idea:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Russia

You bring up Kievan Rus, but really Russia started with Muscovy being Mongol vassal and laying waste to the other Rus people, getting strong enough to take on what remained after Mongols left - Golden Horde. 

Russia winning? What exactly. They can project military power, nice. 

But they have economy based on oil and gas. In next few decades it's very likely that new technologies will make oil and gas redundant. It would mean collapsing Russian economy, government and military. 

All this while USA, China and EU is racing towards AI (mostly USA and China), and those three players have economy based on links with whole world, making stuff better and more with every year, while Russia lags behind relying on raw materials.

I don't necessarily think it's fair to be that low, yes, but it's also based on the fact that a lot of investigative journalists are threatened and prevented from doing their job, I think.

&gt; Also Peevski doesn't own nearly as much, his forte is print media where he is king sadly. 

Again, my apologies, I wrote that in a hurry and I exaggerated, on both sides. However, I'm really against this kind of consolidation of media, it benefits nobody, except the owners (in two ways, both because of editorial control they can exercise, and, obviously, revenue).

It is.

Because Germany's military power is non-existent (Again, intentional), France has put itself in a position where it simply doesn't have the leverage to compare itself to Germany anymore. The UK was much closer to having Germany's influence, in large part because their economic influence and connection to capital was much more relevant than that of France.

If France would like a table at the big boy seat, they should have followed up on Macron's economic reforms - from what I've heard, they have become *so* unpopular domestically, along with the man himself, that they're basically DoA. Any future campaign will win if they advocate reversing anything Macron implements. I personally believe the French electorate doesn't *want* to be the counterweight to Germany, certainly not without the sacrifices required to get there. And I don't blame them - the only counterweight to Germany's economic power structure that rules the EU is Germany's citizens waking up to the underhanded way their politics have evolved since reunification and the fall of the USSR. That may not be entirely possible, but the current course can only lead to the eventual failure of the EU. Sacrifices must be made, and Germany has to be one to make it - specifically because Germany is the one that created the failure and benefitted from it.

Helmut Kohl's legacy came to us in the form of Angela Merkel, and nobody paid attention. But just because she doesn't scowl as obviously as he did, the woman is *absolutely ruthless* as a politician, and I believe most Germans have no idea how much harm her government has done to the EU project at large (at the benefit of Germany, so maybe some of them do and simply approve).",,/r/europe/comments/9mxhxm/germany_protects_car_industry_as_eu_goes_for_just/e7ijrc2/,MissionBreakfast,1539182411

A study published in 2002 found a ""very strong significant correlation"" between the Corruption Perceptions Index and two other proxies for corruption: black market activity and overabundance of regulation.

All three metrics also had a highly significant correlation with real gross domestic product per capita (RGDP/Cap); the Corruption Perceptions Index correlation with RGDP/Cap was the strongest, explaining over three fourths of the variance.[9] (Note that a lower index on this scale reflects greater corruption, so that countries with higher RGDPs generally had less corruption.)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_favoritism

Decentralized countries balkanize over time. Believe it or not, most people gravitate towards their own group, ex. most diverse and integrated cities in the US are still heavily segregated. A democracy that does not have a majority to take control will splinter into smaller states. Not a fast process, but still a process that is engraved in favoritism towards your own identity and limit on resources.

India and Israel are bad examples to give as a counter argument, as they do have a majority that is based on identity - jewish and hindu. Majority always splits their vote during any form of election, because they feel that they can afford to. They're still a majority - they will get most of the resources, it's how those resources are allocated is what is up for debate. In contrast minorities vote in collectivist fashion, or as a bloc. That is true in each and every country that has a majority and multiple minorities - majority may still lean one way or another on the political spectrum, but is more balanced in voting patterns; minorities are not balanced during votes, they swing heavily towards a party that consists of minorities, or is seen as pro-minorities. But again, your examples are bad for this argument, because what i described is a country with no majority.

Your last point is very debatable. Dictatorship does not mean no freedom of commerce or innovation. Corruption is a bigger correlation, which a lot of modern dictatorships suffer from, but those are not benevolent. Happiness is also debatable. If a country is split into 10 groups of 10% population each and society starts to lose integrity, people might be happier under a stable dictatorship than under a democracy that is falling apart.",,/r/europe/comments/9mxelf/western_democracies_on_the_decline_including/e7ikb55/,SayaHarahi,1539182884

We probably are in a pre housing bubble again, but again, making it a portuguese problem is wrong. There are more developed countries facing the problem. You can check that here:

Nothing related to luck here. In fact, tourism numbers have been rising a lot in recent years and it started with instability in major touristic places. But guess what? Due to that, Portugal is getting recognized as an outstanding touristic destination (not luck, we have a great country with amazing features), and on top of that, a lot of people that visit us decides to stay or make investments in the country, which also feeds the housing bubble you were talking. It's something that came to stay.

No, it is not. It fell during years of investment retraction. Your link clearly says it rose again in 2017. 

&gt;Our governments were only able to cut expenses on the investment side through captivation.Ex: An arbitrary amount of money is approved to be spent one year before during budget negotiations, but because every expense must go through the finance department they decide not to allow a specific sum to be spent. So this keeps the budget in check but really hurts provided services quality. They basically lie during the negotiations knowing they will never spend the said amount. And yada yada yada.


All of this is political ideology and can be written accordingly with the idea you want to get through. The ""*this creates a very unfair situation in Portuguese society where if you don't work for the state you are forced to live like a slave or leave the country*"" part is laughable. I'm a private sector worker and have dozens of friends/kowns in the same situation and no one feels like a slave.

On top of that, you start by pointing minimum wage raising as a bad thing and then call slaves those that earn a private sector wage. 

The country made huge improvements in the recent years and those efforts will be noticed in the future.

or maybe he just know the fact and make a link to it

&gt;England's, and later Great Britain's, relationship with Russia always oscillated between friendly to distrustful to rivalry. They were on the same side of the Great Northern War and the War of Austrian Succession, but were enemies in the Seven Years' War, though they never fought each other directly. Against Napoleon they were either covert or open allies, as Russia never joined the Continental system on behest of England. And in the 19th century they did grow increasingly hostile during the Great Game in central Asia, but fought the same enemies in World War I and II, and had the Whites beat the Reds in the Russian Civil War, it's likely that the two countries would have grown closer together for it.

I disagree. Of course some circumstances forced them to be allied against one thing or another. Moreover, we were one of the biggest trade pratners, even during mutual war, buisness is buisness. though England had never tried to build any long-term alliance with Russia and always prefered to use it as a external enemy. or at least I haven't heard of such attemps. also you miss a social factor.

For example, the root 'haitz' (stone) is present in the name of various modern tools as if they were palaeolithic ones: Aizkora (axe), aizto (knife), zulakaitz (punch) or aitzurra (hoe). Some details that denote a long continuity of a language. 

The dialect of a language evolves into another when it becomes too unintelligible to communicate with the other dialects of the root language.The Basque that is spoken now is more complete than the Basque before the Roman conquest thanks to the enrichment of the vocabulary, but in essence it remains the same.",,/r/europe/comments/9mlj44/what_do_you_know_about_the_basque_country/e7i7idy/,kaitoren,1539168352

996,"As I've said before, this is not a ""diesel ban"" and use of the term is a misnomer.  It is banning Euro5 vehicles.  This effectively taxes auto owners, by forcing them to buy newer vehicles, and generates more sales for the auto manufacturers, transferring consumer money to them.

That is, the auto company that caused the harm will walk away with additional sales.

I suppose you could say that it could be considered part fault of the regulatory system, and so transferring it to the public…well, maybe there's an argument for that.  But then it seems odd to structure the cost in such a way, because this is not evenly distributed over people who would normally bear tax burden or elect people who appoint regulators.

Wealthy car owners who are driving the latest and greatest also won't take a hit.  It'll be the probably less-well-to-do people driving older vehicles that will either be banned from the city or have to pay more.  And I suppose that their vehicles will be moved elsewhere and sold at below-market rate.

The people who suffer the costs here are the residents of Berlin who had to spend years breathing the stuff, the people elsewhere (probably in Europe) who will continue to do so, and the poorer owners of cars or people who don't drive their car much and own their car for a long time.  I'd guess that the people who tend to breathe these emissions will tend to be in poorer areas that drive older automobiles.

The people who made the decisions involved with the emission levels were automakers and *possibly* people involved with the regulatory effort (for the latter bit, I'd expect the public as a whole to be responsible).

To be honest, that doesn't seem particularly economically-efficient.  It's rewarding the people who made the decision and profited from it and punishing further people who were already hurt.

Ordinarily, to internalize an [externality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality), you want the people who make the decision and benefit from it to be the ones to bear the cost of that decision.  If you do not do that, you create [moral hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard).  Moral hazard produces [market failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure).  You don't want that in a market economy.

Nor does this stop at Dieselgate alone, because this is sending a message to all other industry in the EU.  If I am an automaker in the EU today, or even a manufacturer of some other sort of goods sold, and I am debating whether to take a risky move that screws over consumers, the message I get here is that being politically-connected permits me to avoid eating the costs.  That is bad — it causes markets to tend to not to be efficient.

Maybe, due to political realities, the EU moves ahead and lets automakers walk on this.  But if so, I think that it would be a good idea to send as convincing a message as possible that this sort of thing will not be permitted *in the future*, that next time, the manufacturers will eat the costs.  That may mean restructuring how the independence of regulation works or how product liability or class-action suits or whatever work.

Maybe that's already happening — I don't know, haven't followed all the fallout.  But the people who need to be convinced that it will happen are not people like me, but industrialists who are making decisions about whether to pull stunts like this in the future.  They need to feel that this is not a smart gamble, so they don't do it.

Nothing what you counted was exclusive to Europeans and Africans. Europeans were doing it all to each other for thousands of years, Asians were doing it all for each other, Africans were doing it all for each other, Europeans did it to Asians and Asians did it to Europeans. We all have moved on.

The only - somehow - different situation is when Europeans did it to Africans.

The colonial peroid lasted only for 90 of years and Europeans moved from there out of their own will.

For how long Finland was free for example? For how long balkan nations were colonized under Ottomans? For how long Slavic people, Irish (and many other) were sold for slaves?

For how long south and central Americans were colonized by Spain or Portugal? For how long America was british and french colony?

Africans are completely free for 60 years already. Longer than some European nations. The decolonisation is the best thing that could ever happen to Europe. If Africans are living better lives than 70 years ago it's only due to general technological progress. But relativy they are worse of.

They are only like 10 or so countries they were not colonized by Europe (but they might still be colonized, just by somebody else), but only Africans are not responsible for their lifes. The special case.

Depends. We do not expect people to mod every single day, but we do expect them to do a reasonable amount of mod actions per month. This can be dealt with by spending a few minutes every day or in a more ""concentrated"" manner. 

&gt; How long does it take to get up to speed on the general moderation tools, procedures, etc? 

It always depends on the person. Some are faster, some require a bit more time. The trial period is two months, but the trial mods are already moderating actively during these months.

Yes. We have a long guide that should answer all questions plus more resource pages.

1262,"I agree with you, but I think it's disingenuous to label it as ""live-to-work"".

The major problem is pension system is a ponzi scheme by design. When it was started, many people didn't reach pension age at all. Some did and they could expect to live few years on pension. Modern expectation of years of cushy pension was possible only thanks to baby boom, world wars wiping out older generations and massive inequality on global scale. Now baby boom is long over, older generations are alive and kicking for much longer and poor parts of the world are catching up.

I don't expect to get any money from this ponzi scheme either. I wouldn't say it's ""bad"", it's just how it is. I could be salty I wasn't born in different place at different time to ride the golden pensions wave... But then I could be salty I'm not Arab Sheikh too :)

Average pension in Lithuania is €330. AFAIK median is close to it. Not exactly nice, but ain't bad either. Sure covers basic stuff, given that they got their housing from soviet times.

1266,"Pretty hot, and you'd get cooked pretty well even without maximum temperatures.

But exactly what would kill you and when is another question.  The flows came after the area had already been pummeled by rock, ash, and hit by shock waves; from the article itself

&gt; In the first phase, immediately after the eruption, a long column of ash and pumice blanketed the surrounding towns, most notably Pompeii and Herculaneum. By late night or early morning, pyroclastic flows (fast-moving hot ash, lava fragments, and gases) swept through and obliterated what remained

&gt;Most scientists assumed the Pompeii victims not killed by falling debris suffocated from the thick clouds of ash and gas, believing the temperatures of the material spewed forth by Vesuvius would not have been hot enough to cause outright death. There was good cause to think so, given the state of the bodies, the outline of clothing still visible on some. But a 2010 study by volcanologists estimated that the temperatures of the pyroclastic surge that destroyed Pompeii could have been as high as 572°F, killing the populace in fractions of a second.

Reading the article would show their high estimates aren't even a third of that maximum, though still pretty hot (will kill you right quick).  But it still comes after, and doesn't explain why so many victims have clothing (if it can flash-boil your brain, your clothes are likely to be toast too).  Perhaps some survivors encountered the flow and had their lungs burst and cooked, but this is just one more cherry in the cocktail of death that was Pompeii.",,/r/europe/comments/9mpgc6/extreme_heat_of_vesuvius_eruption_vaporized_body/e7hxik9/,TakoyakiBoxGuy,1539149015

Other fun facts collected [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajont_Dam):

1.  Construction work started in 1957, but by 1959 shifts and fractures were noticed during the construction of a new road on the side of Monte Toc. This led to new studies in which three experts separately told SADE that the entire side of Monte Toc was unstable and would likely collapse into the basin if the filling were completed.[4] All three were ignored by SADE. 

2. Throughout the summer of 1960, minor landslides and earth movements were noticed. However, instead of heeding these warning signs, the Italian government chose to sue at least one of the journalists reporting the problems.

3. On 4 November 1960, with the water level in the reservoir at about 190 metres (620 ft) of the planned 262 metres (860 ft), a landslide of about 800,000 cubic metres (1,000,000 cu yd) collapsed into the lake. SADE stopped the filling, lowered the water level by about 50 metres (160 ft), and started to build an artificial gallery in the basin in front of Monte Toc to keep the basin usable even if additional landslides (which were expected) divided it into two parts.

1394,"&gt;They are citizens of these nations and should not be seen as some scary alien vestige of the old days but as neighbors.

This account disregards the fact that most of the russians living in Eastern European countries are the result of over 50 years of Soviet domination. These citizens were not vetted, entered the lands in the context of annexation (without the consent of the occupied country) and can be accurately described as colonists, who came here to benefit from the occupation at the expense of the local populations, who were subjugated and displaced by the Soviet Union.

In other words, this isn't some classic case of immigration, where the migrants have taken a deliberate choice to settle in a foreign land. The migration policies of the Soviet Union were utilized as a demographic control mechanism to suppress conquered territories (Baltics, Ukraine etc) - effectively a civil occupation, which was intended to dilute the local populations and to ensure the irreversibility of the annexation. 

As such, the russian minority just isn't perceived as your friendly neighbourhood citizens by the ethnic natives. They are seen as the spearhead of the Russian Federation, which has the means and the imperial ambitions to threaten their independence. Along with the unambiguous loyalty to Putin and clear disloyalty to NATO, it's questionable how committed these ""citizens"" really are to their host nations.

i purposefully asked why do cops need to shoot at people that are running away. the obvious answer is that they need to contain the raping murdering crackheads that are high on meth, cocaine and weed at the same time. because they cant run after them, since they have gear and sit down alot. poor cops.

another thing that i noticed is that people divide humans into innocent and raping murdering crackheads that are high on meth, cocaine and weed at the same time. and i dont think thats how humans are.

obviously a big par of gun related deaths are gang related and suicides, but that could be lowered by..banning guns. which if you're a sensible human being, would just waver your right for the greater good. but y'know..people and thinking...

so yeah, between obesity, gun ""accidents"", car accidents, smoking, over working, lack of mental health and high incarceration risks, americans die quite often. dunno why, but i think it rhymes with bapitalism.

1444,"&gt;This changed basically nothing. Libya doesn't have a coast guard that can actually do anything aside from some show operations.

This did everything.

One, large portion of SAR missions are done by cargo ships (used to be majority, I think now its between 30 and 40 percent). Cargo ships contact MRCC. If Tripoli one doesnt exist, they contact Italian one. Italian one per EU law cannot direct them to offload the migrants on neither LCG ships, nor at Libyan land. So in past when MRCC gave order it was ""sail to Sicily"". Now its ""sail to Tripoli / meet up with LCG Patrol Boat at these coordinates"". JRCC Tripoli, of course, has zero issues with giving this order and thus ships do that. Mostly offshore rigs, but it does the trick.

LCG also boosted capabilties. This September we were looking at number of cca 70 percent those who departed Libya being returned to Libya by JRCC / LCG. Around 20 percent drowned at sea and around 10 percent managed to reach Europe (ISPI latest report)

&gt;The real power is with the smuggling gangs, who control the migrant traffic and the ports. Italy quite simply paid them off to stop smuggling immigrants, so now they've been switching to the Morocco route.

We're at spitting distance from France, and our opinions on welfare, structure of government, foreign policy, etc. Are downright incompatible. New Zealand and Australia share much culture, probably more in common with each other than anyone else in the world, but they're still separate nations and they disagree on key issues that are deal breakers for them (treatment of natives, welfare again, foreign policy again, etc.) Anglo Canadians and Americans sound identical to anyone outside of north America, but they're not going to be sharing any country either. Another example, Russia and Belarus are also separate. The various Scandinavian Unions, Iceland and Norway became independent from Denmark and Sweden, Finland became independent from Sweden. 


Not to mention that there are plenty of countries outside Europe that we probably have more in common with. The UK definitely is closer culturally to Australia, NZ and Anglo Canada than it is to Europe. I imagine Spain has more in common with Mexico and Argentina and so on than it does with Finland and Bulgaraia.

Financially, tariffs are just like taxes: HM Treasury cashes in what it takes out of the pockets of British consumers. Since no money flows out of the UK, there's no ""net loss"".

However, if you define ""net loss"" in a broader economical sense, for instance, in terms of utility, there is indeed a net loss. The whole point of tariffs is to increase prices while adding no value, i.e. decreasing its utility and, in the long run, productivity. That's indeed a net loss for the economy as a whole and the main reason why most economists aren't huge fanboys of tariffs.

1548,"\&gt; You thus create a false dichotomy between European brands and brands perceived to be British.

Simply no, i made a shitpost about the non existing British car industry. That you try to inject meaning into it that isn't there just shows that sometimes over-analyzing will yield results that are not present in the matter at hand, thus making a fool out of yourself.

\&gt; If you weren't creating a false dichotomy, you wouldn't have suggested that only one type of alternative was available. 

But here's some food for thought: When the UK is out of the EU, all trade agreements it has via the EU will cease to apply. Thus tariffs (depending on how the UK leaves) will apply to all foreign produced cars, therefore the only choice is to buy locally produced cars if the increase in price is too much. Thus, listing the ""British"" companies is a very valid choice as in general it is assumed that those companies will produce a large number of cars in their ""home"" market.

So if you try to divide the possible cars companies you can buy from into 2 separate groups, if anything it's British VS the world. And here comes the main part i played at: The money is still going to the same groups outside of the UK that the poster i replied to wants to replace. Therefore replacing German and French company cars with other brands will matter little if the money still ends in the same place.

Russians couldn't trade, so they stayed relatively poor compared to US allies, after second world war, although they have had much more resources. They kept them there until they collapsed. That is what you can do with embargos when you control global trade. They have significant effect in the long run. Who do you think would support Putin if his policies would make all Russians poorer in the next decade? Of course he will talk about evil West, buy who cares about some regime in Syria or pice of Georgia, when your money doesn't buy anything anymore, while your government rises up retirement age? It is a long game, but it sure works. It is up to Russians to understand it and start acting like the country they are and not the one they would like to be. However the problem with that is they would have to join Western world, play by its rules, give citizens some rights, stop putting them into prison for different views and so on. In such a form, without repression, Russia would not survive. First people would change the mafia that is currently running their country. Kick out oligarchs, probably prosecute them for next years to follow. This is most of their elits.

Second different regions would start pursuing their own interests, with no pressure from the top. It would break into pieces with minorities in Caucus, middle Asia, as well as Eastern Europe and Eastern Asia all making their own independent alliances with neighbouring countries. China wouldn't even need to invade eastern parts, they would end up in her sphere of influence, following their own. Kaliningrad would surely want to join Euro market, together with her neighbors as oppose to staying enclave of misery. Regions behind Ural mountains wouldn't be able to feed them selves and start to depopulate. Not to mention all small communities that would gladly become independent of Russia, even by means of force, like Chechens. Some of them occupying essential area for the national security.

All in all Russia can't really survive without being oppressive state and it can only justify oppression towards her own citizen with ""fighting the West"". As long as they do ""fight the West"", West won't let them into the supply chain and with Americans becoming energy supplier, they will push them out of the little Russia has. I mean it's 140 mln people, with economy smaller than Italians, based on selling energy. That is where embargoes and alike come into play.

Russia has hardly ever been occupied, due to its geography; but it surely has collapsed by itself on more than one occasion. Economic measures sooner or later will bring that effect, if they won't comply.

### Economically inactive people in the EU: who are they?

 

Last year, 89 million people aged 15 to 64 were [economically inactive](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Inactive)[ ](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Inactive)in the European Union (EU). In other words, slightly more than a quarter (27.1%) of the EU population aged 15-64 stood outside the labour market, being neither [employed](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Employed_person_-_LFS)[ ](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Employed_person_-_LFS)nor [unemployed](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Unemployed&amp;redirect=no). This included people who were in education or training (35% of the inactive people), retired (16%), suffering from serious illness or disability (16%), or also those who were looking after children or incapacitated adults (10%). Women made up the majority of this economically active population group (60%). In total, almost 8 in 10 inactive people (78%) declared that they did not wish to work.

The level of education seemed to play a role, as the proportion of inactive people in the EU fell as educational levels rose among them. While almost half (47%) of those aged 15-64 with a low education level (at most lower secondary education) were inactive in 2016, this share decreased to 24% for those with a medium education level and fell to 12% when it came to the part of the population with a high education level (tertiary education).",,/r/europe/comments/9mslme/share_of_inactive_population_among_eu_nations/e7h300w/,smilelyzen,1539118541

The person responsible is Minniti not the man who threatens to remove police protections from the anti-mafia author who are under threat from the mafia.

&gt; 
&gt; I ask if [Marco Minniti] ever shouts at the TV when Mr Salvini claims he's the one who stopped migration.
&gt; 
&gt; He laughs.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ""The point is this. Italy managed to show Europe and the world that you can manage migration, keeping two principles in mind: humanity and security. Now we're in another phase. There is no migrant emergency in Italy,"" he replies.
&gt;

1702,"&gt; You failed to answer my main argument though, why should the US continue to subsidies much of the rest of the worlds security needs when the main reasons for the US doing so for the last 70 years stopped being factors?

Because that's the main error: Your premise is flawed. These factors did not stop being factors - if anything, they've become even more important since the time you obviously base your worldview on (which, by a rough estimation, should be the 1950s). 

&gt; Energy needs gone,

Nope. *Domestic* need for net energy imports has subsided, but that never has been the main reason why the US went into the Middle East or any place with primary energy ressources. The reason you did it was to keep the finger on the scales of *other* countries' energy needs. That's why energy still is a matter for the National Security Council in DC, which wouldn't make any sense whatsoever for a country that prides itself on its energy independence. 

Moreover, not only is the US becoming independent on energy imports, but actually producing so much of it that it's concernd about increasing its strategic exports in that sector (remember the LNG deals for Europe?), and I gather you don't what those hellishly expensive LNG tankers across the Atlantic and the Pacific taken down by piracy or the Chinese due to neglecting to protect the sea lanes which you allegedly totally don't need at all.

&gt; security needs gone...

""Security"" wasn't an issue for the United States since the War of 1812. Ever since that time, US presence in other countries has either been to secure markets or assert dominance. If it were about security, you'd basically scrap the Pentagon and just retain a sizeable coast guard, a small but advanced air force, a small border patrol on the US-Mexican border and a few nukes as a deterrent - for precisely the reasons you've cited correctly: Nobody threatens you. 

&gt; so why continue patrolling the global commons for trade we barely do anyway? 

Are you serious? [The US is #1 or #2](http://stat.wto.org/CountryProfile/WSDBCountryPFView.aspx?Country=US) (depending on the accounts) in total global trade volume, so to go around and say you ""barely"" trady anyway is a flat-out falsehood (I don't want to use the word 'lie' since there's an off chance you really don't know about this).

Secondly, one of the main reasons the US set up the current global trade order after the Second World War was that it had learned the lessons of the 1920s and 1930s: By creating three main economic blocks (North America, Europe and Japan), rebuilding them, allowing them to prosper and keeping them secure, you not only take away the main driver of global instability and mayhem (widespread depression and economic anxiety), but nourish an environment enhancing your own global reach by way of creating stable, affluent markets from where to import high-quality goods and where to export high-quality goods in return and in the process creating economic shock absorbers on both oceans which prevent a repetition of the catastrophic economic situation in the 1930s which had huge domestic ramifications for the US.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9lmvdw/the_united_states_is_likely_to_succeed_in/e7gt13v/,ColourFox,1539110428

1740,"&gt; 1 ""a bit from time to time"" i have no problem believing this is the extent of your reading practices indeed. Do you feel that if lets say, a wall was built around Croatia + Serbia + BiH and there would be no meddling whatsoever from outside that there would be peace within these territories ?

there almost literally was a wall (we were surrounded by Iron Curtain) - we lived fine with each other. As soon as that wall was demolished and meddling from outside started, everything went south.

you can read about it sometimes.

btw I was being sarcastic with expression  ""a bit from time to time""  but I guess I overstated your intelligence. Guess I need to speak in litteral terms only with you.

&gt; Ah so i guess you at least support the house of peoples being representatives from the major ethnic groups instead of , like right now, muslims picking muslims to be the croat representatives (care to take a guess if komsic or covic is the one proposing the ending of this practice?).


? No - I do not support that. How did you come to that conclusion?

 They are not representatives of ethnic groups once they are elected. They are representatives of all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina - muslims did not pick Croat into Presidency nor Bosniaks did nor Serbs did , nor Croats did. Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina picked Croat into Presidency - just like they picked other two members.

&gt;  I am not even saying in some ideal world this would be bad, but in the current system this is 100% impossible and it is unethical to abuse the system to have 1 president to look after the rights of the serbs, 2 to look after the rights of muslims and 0 for the croats.

How is it abuse of system if citizens vote and citizens pick all three candidates?

&gt;  Who is this one guy that will do his job ? The guy that was elected 2 times already and did nothing close to his job and is spouting ethnic hatred and conspiracies in every media appearance ?

If you really followed his work - you know that he was working in the interests of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its all citizens - its not his fault that other two  were not doing their job as they should have.

But when you look at the facts, its clear why Bosnia and Herzegovina is set up the way it is: According to the last census in 2013, 50 % are Bosniaks, 30 % are Serb and 15 % are Croat. And then you can take a look at this map: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Bosnia_Herzegovina_Ethnic_2013.png

If there was an easy solution, it would have happened years ago. But things are more complex: There is no easy way to split up Bosnia and Herzegovina, because its ethnic groups are too spread out. 

If you split it in two and give one part to Croatia and one part to Serbia, Bosniaks (remember, the biggest part of the population) will live separated in two nations and end up stateless essentially – so much for the right for self-determination.

Even if you split it in three parts and give Bosniaks their own nation: It would still be no good, because then you would have a large chunk of Serbia that is separated from the rest of the country.

1763,"&gt;I think you are oversimplifying things with a cognitive bias, rather than interpreting circumstances with a constructive approach. Moreover, I don't even remember an investigation to have occurred when those kids died, yet along the UN saying 'multiple times Serbs had nothing to do', because the reaction of the masses was quite rapid and it would have hindered the possibility of an investigation.

Eh the investigation was after the incident and it also found that Albanian 'witnesses' were having huge inconsistencies.

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_unrest_in_Kosovo#Prelude


&gt;The UN found no evidence that Serbs were responsible for drowning the three Albanian children.[27]

So yeah.
&gt;What the UN said back then, was quite different to what the locals saw and witnessed and as a result revolted against the nonchalance of the authorities. Although, I would understand the reasoning that they wanted to prevent an ethnic conflict by overruling it as an incident by two different ethnic groups.

Yes, we should believe witnesses who hate Serbs on their word right, not a UN investigation?

&gt;And the last claim you have posed about the ethnic cleansing of Serbs during the 2004, is simply wrong and not supported by any facts. In the same sense Serbs migrated north from Kosovo, Albanians migrated in European Union states for a better life as a result of the crisis and situation in Kosovo. 

Are you for real? 

You call 935 burned houses 'migrating' what the hell are you smoking?

&gt;Should I attempt to put fault in the Serbs in Kosovo or those in Belgrade for the situation both countries have? Partly, Yeah; because the constant vacuum in politics both countries are engulfed has impacted the future of its own citizens. But the reasons behind this are far more complicated than your oversimplification attempts you made up there. The least I can do, is agree to disagree. I'm more interested in a solution that benefits both than pointing fingers on who is at fault, or who actually was.

There is no solution that benefits both parties.

Because people don’t value Irish enough

Because there’s enormous advantage in being a native English speaker, especially when the country was exporting half its population. Easy to forget that was basically Irish govt policy up until the 1980s. 

Because while Irish is compulsory in schools, the curriculum was (maybe still is?) outdated. If rote memorization of mediaeval poetry is your thing you would have loved it.

There are few opportunities to use Irish in day to day life, most people have the cúpla focal but lack the confidence to use them. Not unrelated is the rank snobbery of a portion of Irish speakers, dismissive of ”book Irish”.

Yes it works wonderfully to make their population even more nationalistic and anti-western, and to make Russia develop it's relationship with China as an anti-american bloc, certainly it doesn't hurt Putin's grip on power nor does it hurt their military sector.

&gt;The nukes can never be used realistically because the other nukes will hit them back

The nukes will be used if Russia's territory is invaded or in case of a war with NATO, that's all they are there for, and they are the reason why Russian and Nato troops will never ever shoot at each other even if they are in the same theater on opposing sides (Syria). 

&gt;Their military is decent, but they were quite bad when they invaded Ukraine. They are not as good as they hope, at least.

""Decent"" on what standard? Name an army other than the american one and MAYBE the PLA that is as capable as Russia's. They have combat readiness and combat-proven doctrines and equipment inferior only to the US (with Anti-Air capabilities superior even to NATO ones) and probably the most advanced tecnique of hybdrid warfare (propaganda, militias, contractors, cyber warfare,  intelligence).

What do you mean that they were quite bad when they invaded Ukraine? They accomplished their strategic objectives in Donbass and seized Crimea with basically no effort, unless you mean that they wanted to drive all the way to Kiev and Odessa but that's not what they were going for.

1817,"French Guiana? Independentist? Hardly. They'd be a third world country if it weren't for France subsidizing its existence. There are economic problems there, of course, with unemployment and high prices for goods. But it would surely be worse if France wasn't pumping money into it. In know that in the last decade, some overseas territories had referendums (was it Mayotte?) and naturally took the right decision (for their own good) to stay French territories.

Maybe you're confused with New Caledonia, an already largely autonomous territory, which is about to have a referendum for independence. It may be a close election, but I'm predicting it won't vote for independence. Like other French overseas territories, it's too small, in size and population, to support itself, and to maintain the ""developed"" quality of life they've become accustomed to. Not to mention that New Caledonia has a sizable community of [Caldoches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldoche) (almost a third of the population), ie white or mostly white settlers who see themselves as French. In Guiana, and other overseas territories around the Caribbean or Africa, whites are a much smaller part of the population. Not to mention that the native people of New Caledonia, a Melanesian people called the Kanak, are less than half of the population. The rest are mixed, or immigrants from other parts of the Pacific, and thus don't necessarily have a sense of ethnic autonomy in New Caledonia.

If you ask me, considering most or all overseas territories of France are economic drains, as they don't have that many valuable resources, I wouldn't mind them being independent. Their usefulness is for military and scientific bases,  and perhaps prestige (""the Sun never sets on...""). It gives France the or one of the largest EEZ too. But unfortunately, there are no massive oil findings in those waters.

In metropolitan (European) France, independence movements, or at least movements which advocate for more autonomy, are indeed stronger in Corsica above all else. There's some talk of it in Brittany but for now it's rather tame. Other autonomous regions which non-French people fantasize about are Alsace, the Basque country, all of Occitania (Southern half of the country), or even Normandy (which I like to call the most French region of France). But those it's mostly fantasy. They're far and away from any large movement. ",France,/r/europe/comments/9mlj44/what_do_you_know_about_the_basque_country/e7gkt9j/,MartelFirst,1539103351

1833,"&gt;The US Constitution makes international law part of US law

Only if international law can conform with the Constitution and the treaty is signed by both the Senate and the President. Any law signed by the international community without the US means it is not the law of the land within the US. For example:

[Kinsella v. Krueger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsella_v._Krueger): ""The Constitution supersedes all treaties ratified by the United States Senate.""

or

[Reid v. Covert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_v._Covert):""No agreement with a foreign nation can confer power on the Congress, or on any other branch of Government, which is free from the restraints of the Constitution. The Court's core holding of the case is that U.S. citizen civilians abroad have the right to Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment constitutional protections.""

&gt;International law is binding on you whether you ""sign up"" for it or not

is simply not true...If the US is unwilling to enforce international law nor sign up for institutions like the International Criminal Court then its not subject to its laws. You can't actually force countries to do things they don't sign up for especially if they don't agree if the institution even has the authority in the matter. 

These are sovereign nations, their authority rests above international law. If the US or India do not sign up, tough that law does not exist within these nations borders.

and yah ill say it again **non-consequential**, as in they can't enforce these international laws you hold so dear. If you cant enforce your will then who the hell cares...I mean really, Why should the US do what is against its best interest because a bunch of other countries said so.

Also yah because to become a ""Rogue State"" you have to go against the international order we wrote in 1946. Iceland does not have a Navy to patrol the seas and enforce the US mandate of ""Freedom of the Global Commons"" established by the US in '46. Don't like it tough, build a navy and do it for us and then you get a seat at the big boys table. Till then if no one else is capable of calling the shots then we will continue to do it.

The US isn't a hit squad were weaker nations get to decide what international law is by virtue of simple majority and the US must use its military force to ensure all comply. You might not like it but might makes right in our world.

Having politics in a country unaffected by ethnic questions only works if you have only one major ethnic group or if most people in each ethnic group refrain from acting in a tribal way.

--------------------

Long story short: our current government dislikes cricism and wants to control everything.

--------------------------

Long story long:

Our current government since the start of their term has been having bad relationships with journalists. They tried messing with the freedom of press but it wasn't succesful (investigation of E. Jakilaitis (the most famous and respected journalist) and his friends company is still going on but no news have been published for a long time). Right now here is another situation. Since A. Brazauskas' times (1992-1998) the data from Registry Centre was given for free for journalist, for other physical/juridical people it costs 27ct. Such practice has stoped being excecuted in the middle of September. This hit investigation type journalism like a truck. Journalist started asking our government ""why"". The shit hit the fan last week when the solution to this problem could be solved.The minister R. Masiulis in government meeting offered our prime minister such idea: ""those press/media companies that follow ethical journalism (it's reglamented) shall receive the information from Registry Centre for free"", our prime minister S. Skvernelis rejected such idea. So journalists (by email) started asking our government for the audio record what happened in that government session/meeting. And they answered something like that ""Coordinated action :) Everyone is asking. We won't give [it]"". At the same time S. Skvernelis said free information is only good for media bussines and that's bad. The media explained that it's only profitable for the state ""we have only lost our sponsors that were touched by the investigations while the state got profit by getting formerly avoided taxes from corrupt politicians/companies"". The next reform that would be done/is done (idk) with Registry Centre is that it wouldn't give records that happened more than 3 years ago. Yesterday we found out that that record from government meeting was destroyed ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯. 

Today another idea was presented in our parliament. They want to control the content of internet. They have 2 options: to controll everyone - they probably won't, or to control internet TVs. And there is only one TV on the Internet - Laisvės TV (Freedom TV) [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMfPBtm9CWGswAXohT5MFyQ)/[patreon](https://www.patreon.com/laisvestv/) that are mostly funded by regular people like me via Patreon platform, they accept sponsors but they limit themselvs the amount of money they can get from companies in order to stay independed. From the all of the tvs they bite politicians the most as their main weekly show is late night show with a lot of political satire. So everyone understand it would a low toward them. 

There is more but I'd have to go to the context or details but I do not know everything, and I'm too lazy to go into deep

Yea pretty much. The descendants of Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam are now usually called Bosniaks. 

&gt;How the f did they become ""Turk"" tho? They don't speak the language right?

The weird terminology had to do with how the Ottoman Empire was structured. In the millet system people were divided by legal communities depending on their religion rather than ethnicity/nationality. As a result Christians who converted to Islam largely gained the same privileges as the Turks themselves. For this reason ""Turk"" was sometimes used in part of the European Ottoman Empire as a synonym for Muslim, even for people with no Turkic heritage and know in most cases spoke no Turkish.

It matters a lot actually. Italian or Polish immigrants to USA also had their identity destroyed and their offspring became Americans and not Italian or Poles, but nobody sane would argue it was a process comparable to German policies during Kulturkampf or Nazi Germany, or what Russian Empire did towards it conquered provinces.

What happened in the Commonwealth was much closer to the former, than to the latter examples.

But at the moment the reality is also that the Arab citizens of Israel (20% of the population) are not lacking in any right or privilege that the Jews (and other minorities) have. It's a functional democracy, just one that currently has classical liberal leadership that doesn't mind beating a nationalist or religious drum if it suits the electorate. Populism at its finest. 
The occupation is a difficult situation for the country, there is no one solution that isn't either a) severely unjust or b) risks a total civil war. People within Israel proper just want to be safe so excuse the repression of the people outside of it, unless they have family there like many Israeli Arabs do. 

As for supporting the state; what does that mean? It's today quite clear that we need a safe haven, Europe isn't exactly getting any cosier for minorities. Besides, we have as much of a right to national self-determination as any other people - and Israel is a fait accomplis (basically why labour zionism became a thing). Zionism is a national movement, like there are everywhere. It's indicative of the merits and downsides of nationalism. --Both can be very considerable.-- One of the dangers lies in extreme ethnic nationalism. Israel was founded on a much more civil basis with some Ottoman millet artefacts to make everything work - much like what Lebanon struggles with as well. 

So while I don't applaud the current government for anything really, I am a staunch supporter of Israel. What else are we to do? While I'm a critic, I also feel Europeans have no idea how just the society is run, how protected the minorities within the state are or how difficult it is to actually reach any kind of solution over occupied territories.

This is the profit part. It was a deal, not a charity. 

&gt;most of Eastern Europe qualified population migrated to Western Europe so it's not hugely profitable for both sides

Most people emigrated becouse there were no jobs for them in their home country. They got jobs and send remittances back home (that were responsible for 2.5% of the whole polish GDP in 2006 and 2007). As stated in [this](https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/154560/2012-12_Barbone.pdf) short publication:

&gt;remittances have increased GDP growth and, most importantly, have contributed to increased welfare for some of the least well-to-do segments of the Polish population

BTW if migration was such a great thing for western parts of the EU, than we should open borders for all the refugees that we can find huh?

&gt;Furthermore there are now talks for lowering the amount of money Western Europe gives to Eastern Europe so the deal is now even better for Western Europe and even worse for Eastern Europe

But you said they have all the rights in the world. 

But now they should expect to be stoned when visiting a church?
You don't seem very good at logic.

Going by that logic Albanians can't expect anything from Serbs or Serbia because they were involved in ethnic terorrism in Serbia and in Kosovo (+ Macedonia). 


&gt;2) No idea why this stabbing has happened. I dont think it was because of hate, maybe they had other problems? If they stabbed him just because he was a serb thats just plain stupid, never justified. 

No idea, but as i said, that hate goes both ways, and much more so towards the Kosovo Serbs than towards Albanians.

&gt;What foreign debt? 

The one it accumulated.

2022,"&gt;Ballistic missile trajectories havent changed all that much in recent years, while ABM systems have gotten massively better.

You're right they haven't.

What has changed is that the design now includes reduction of radar reflection, higher speed, multiple warheads,...

Let's quote General John E. Hyten who performed a review of the US capabilities to protect itself from current gen threats:

""In the past year, we continue to see missile tests from North Korea and Iran as well as other nations that are introducing increasingly sophisticated missiles – all of which cause us and our allies deep concern.""

Quite frankly, i can at least bring forth facts even if they come from last-gen performance to speculate on the current gen, while all you have is wishful thinking. You are woefully wrong if you believe that you can reliably prevent a Russian missile attack.

""Hope for the best, expect the worst"" is the mantra in warfare you have to abide by. ""Expecting the best"" will at some point bit you in the ass big time.

And if Poland really want's itself to protect itself from Russia (and not just show it's a valuable ally to the US, which has a worth in itself) it shouldn't expect these defensive weapons to actually prevent anything.

After all, defensive weapons don't prevent wars, unlike nuclear weapons, because to the attacker it doesn't matter much if he needs to use 100 or 200 of something. What matters is the ability to strike back.

2057,"Ugh yeah about that GOTY title there... Red Dead Redemption 2 would like a word with you.. Odessey has nothing on Red Dead. From what ive seen of Odessey it looks very grindy, the microtransactions(which i note the games media hardly talked about) are a major turn off for me too. Like with many of these corporate greed driven games i'll wait for the GOTY version with all the DLC included.

Speaking of the Ancient Greeks though(and I maybe biased af~).. But i'll say the Ancient Greeks sure had the right idea about n when it came to small dicks. They embued all sorts of great qualities into them and they thought extremely highly of small dicks and small dick men etc. Its a great shame that modern Western culture feels the exact opposite on this issue. Things have gone in the total opposite direction compared to Ancient Greece. And its never going back, i was born in the wrong era, interesting how times and beliefs change eh. Who knows what things might like in another 3000 years.


But i digress... When it comes to gayness, one thing the Greeks certainly invented and that's still very much with us today is... The current male beauty standards. I mean Ancient Greece started it, laid down the foundations.. but with Italy and the Renaissance later on and all the classical Greek inspired male statues featuring muscular men, Ancient Greece basically set in stone and set the standard for the perfect idealised male body(ie the six pack, chisled abs, prominent traps &amp; pecs, musculer and buff etc) that we still see everywhere and strive to be today by going to the gym. That's a big part of gayness(and wider maleness n masculinity in general, hetero guys as well) etc and that's all on Ancient Greece.

You're right to assume that I can't pull my foreskin back. I've never seen my the exact tip/glans of my penis either. I'm glad you like what you see :)
Got to say, I love the GIFs that you sent on my post about rubbing lube on my cock. Looks fucking fun, making me horny at the thought of someone doing that to me...Good grief, it's just great!
If you don't mind me asking, where abouts are you from? Also, if you'd like to see more of cock, then check the links below ;)


Sorry for the 8 month late reply. But better late than never~. Now I must say then its great to know that you too cannot retract your foreskin and have full phimosis, Awww yeeeeeaaahhh!!😎. Thx for the confirmation. I comment alot on your content and i just wanted to say hello to my fellow tight foreskin cock brother, a cock twin :). Just wanna say i looooove your cock. Sexy, stumpy, very short and yet thick, a good stubby chode like fatness to it etc and strongly built and perfectly formed imo. And above all i looove your foreskin. How its so long, tight, snouty af &amp; tapered. Full coverage when hard. Overhangy goodness. It has a classical Greek/Roman look to it, some ace acrposthion as they wouldve called it. Simply the best!. 


Anyhoo i gathered that you had phimosis as often when you see cocks with foreskin like yours(and or mine), that very tight looking, fully encompassing covering of the dick by the foreskin when erect, the head straining against the foreskin etc.. it indicates phimosis or at least a very tight foreskin. Most phimotic dicks ive seen have had a foreskin like yours or mine.


I asked and love it so much because im 24 and as you know i've phimosis. And its so very rare to see another young chubby guy with a small cock that looks as yours does. Its so unique. I never thought i'd see a guy with dick like mine. But i was so glad to be wrong. So refreshing and heartening. But exactly like you i've never seen my bellend even too. For me though ive phimosis and I keep everything clean(i use cotton buds now and then to gently clean the inside). For me i find my phimosis is a pleasant tightness, it doesnt hurt and i really looove the aesthetic(I figure as i dont have sheer size i at least have the aesthetic in my favour, which is something(as imo aesthetics makes for a winning cock). But is it the same for you?. On that topic, How has your phimosis effected you?, How do you feel about it?. How do others react to it?. Personally it doesnt bother me, i don't consider it a problem that needs attention at all. I mean 


But I just wanted to say again i love, loooove your dick. That sexy schlong. Its beautiful af. Suckable n fuckable :P. Keep it up mate😍😍😍👌. 

And to answer your question... Im from the West Country, Bristol to be exact. Also i loved those links/gifs(even though you deleted them now, i saw them at the time) they were kick arse,

Also size wise, length &amp; girth wise what do you think of mine, am i good size or not?. Do i stack up well?. Be honest).


But i wanted to ask do you have anymore pics and or especially videos of your cock?. And I'd really love to see you cum through your long tight phimosis foreskin(and also if you do have videos or pics can you be barefoot in them. I like seeing a guy's sexy feet as he jerks it or is in a pic hard). Its always great to find another guy with a cock and foreskin like yours though. Your cock is fantastic. Literally perfection!.

2073,"The UK and EU have already agreed that the most practical way to solve the irish border issue is through max fac and a future trade agreement that removes the need for most border checks. 

But the EU is demanding the UK agree to the irish backstop before it will move on to talk about that, which is a binding agreement allowing the EU to unilaterally take control of NI and keep it in the single market and customs union as well as setup an EU border inside the UK indefinitely. 

Something that breaks the phase one agreement between the UK and EU that no trade barriers would be placed between the UK and NI. And would allow the EU to start collecting tariffs on 60% of NI economy.  

Clearly the UK can't agree to that, even if they did the DUP in Northern Ireland have said they will collapse Mays goverment if she even considers it.   


&gt;And yeah, stop pretending the UK has a unified agenda or unified public opinion, because nothing coherent is coming out from there.

I think the goverment position has been very coherent to be honest at least i am not confused by it, they want a CETA style agreement and max fac is there first choice, May is willing to make some significant compromises in the form of the chequers proposal which includes a common rule book and some compromises on immigration, while brexiters are not.

no one is willing to compromise on the Irish backstop even the MPs that support remain. 

&gt;And how can you discuss trade if you don't even know what borders you have?

How can you solve the issue of avoiding customs checks without discussing trade? 

That is the fundamental issue that has been causing deadlock since day one the EU refuses to talk about trade until the Irish customs border issues are resolved and those issues can't be resolved without discussing trade.

Basically, Bosniaks vote for the 'orange' guy from the graph because they like him best of all the politicians, even though he is an ethnic Croat himself and fills the Croat seat in the presidency. If he remained who he is and didn't change anything besides be a candidate for the Bosniak seat of the presidency, I am sure (personal observation, cant prove this) he would get way more votes from the Bosniaks. I would also vote for him in that case, although I didn't vote for him now.  


So, it does suck for the Croats in Bosnia that their votes are in vain, but to say that Bosniaks want to 'undermine' them in the elections is absurd and anyone who implies that is intentionally being deceiving. They just vote for the guy cuz they like him. Like for example my mom and sister did. They don't follow much politics and they don't have to to know that he is one of the few decent candidates, which makes it easy to vote for him if you aren't invested in politics much but still want to do your civic duty.  
Also, he gets a buttload of votes from the left-leaning Bosniaks and communists.

2113,"In how they self identify.

Bosniak is not an ethnically exclusive term and its usage outside of Bosnia to describe what used to be called 'ethnic Muslims' isn't mirrored in how the term has and is used in the region. I guess the best explanation is that the way identity is formed is better understood as Pre-Nationalist, having its roots in the Ottoman Millet system of social organisation along confessional lines, and it is these confessional groups that have then been reinterpreted and fitted into modern 'national identities'. Since this was at one point an emergent phenomena, different individuals in the past adopted different identities for whatever reasons, and as such some Muslims and Catholics adopted a Serb ethnic/national identity, some Orthodox adopted a Croatian identity, etc but for the most part their coreligionists did not.

My go to example for explaining this sort of thing are the Rusyn. They predominantly reside in Ukrainian Carpathia but also in parts of the Balkans, and are a small East Slavic ethnic group. What is interesting about Rusyns is that they are an extant population that did not undergo or rejected the ethnic/national transformation that lead to modern Ukrainian and Belarusian identity. When you hear someone write or say something like ""The nation is an invented community"" this is what they are talking about. Its also, as you can imagine, controversial as fuck for obvious reasons. Serbs and Croatians do identify as Bosniak/Bosnian in a regional but not in ethnic or national sense, and absent any political continuity between modern Bosnia and medieval Bosnia there connection (Let alone exclusivity) between modern Bosniak identity and the Medieval Kingdom of Bosnia is about as tenuous as the connection between modern Macedonia (FYROM) and ancient Macedonia.

All that aside though, the only ethical or reasonable thing to do though is to go by how people self identify. ",,/r/europe/comments/9mfb1y/absurdity_in_bosnias_election_the_croat_member_of/e7g02p1/,I-165,1539081695

2170,"The issue with VOX and what in my opinion makes it different from other European far-right parties, is that being anti-immigration is really just a minor aspect of their political ideology. Whereas elsewhere in Europe most of these parties have gained popularity due to the current immigration/refugee crisis and the consequent inaction of mainstream parties (plus EU scepticism), being againt immigrants or against the EU is not really a defining aspect of this party.

They are not an anti-immigration otherwise socially progressive party (aka nativists). They're old-fashioned Spanish traditionalists.

As it is always been with Spain, the rise of far-right movements has to do with Spain itself and the nature of the country. It is a counterreaction to regional nationalisms; a cyclical struggle and centuries old.

For the most hardcore Spanish nationalists the conservative government (PP) has been ""too soft""  with Catalan nationalism, so they have shifted their support towards VOX. This party has always been there, but they're now gaining adepts due to the Catalan crisis.

They're traditionalists at heart (the remains of the old Falange, Franco's party), so they are ultra-Catholics, anti-abortion, they want to centralise Spain and remove regional languages, put an end to autonomous governments and follow a Spanish-only policy. And that's what will prevent them from gaining more support, because someone from Castile or Andalusia or Galicia may be in favour of being tougher with Catalans or restricting immigration, but they won't support getting rid of all autonomous communities or banning abortion.

&gt;The president visited a home and chatted to two young men. The first told him that he had recently been released from prison after a stint for armed robbery. Mr Macron told him to “stop troublemaking”, adding: “Your mother deserves better.”



&gt;Emmanuel Macron said he loved “every child of the Republic, however foolish they’ve been”.

&gt;He said that after the photo was taken, the two young men had brought over a handicapped girl who wanted to greet him. A video broadcast on BFM TV shows Macron telling the self-confessed offender, in front of his mother, that he must put the robberies behind him and rebuild his life.

&gt;This photo was taken during a visit to Saint Martin (a French overseas territory) after Macron had met a young man that had recently been released from prison for larceny. Macron wanted to make sure this man got himself on the right path and visited his mother's home nearby where this photo was taken. You could see the Macron lecture the man that he should make an effort for the sake of his mother and you see Macron hug the man's crying mother afterwards. It's honestly an endearing and human moment for him. But removed from all context this image is making the rounds in France being misrepresented as Macron being weak on delinquents.

2287,"&gt;However, Dowling believes VOX would have a hard time mobilising anti-immigrant sentiment in Spain because ""anti-immigrant sentiment has always been pretty weak in Spain for a variety of reasons.""

That variety of reasons being that we've traditionally been having south Americans, intra EU, and Chinese. Meaning most of our immigrants are people who speak the language, are very close culturally, and even then there's been some issues. And the Chinese are just a model immigrant everywhere, with most complaints being: ""they work too hard"", ""their children study too much"", ""they open too many small businesses"". Hardly compelling arguments. 

Now that Moroccans have become the largest single migrant group, and we're getting thousands upon thousands of MENA and Africans, watch as anti migrant sentiment rises. 

&gt;Unlike other European countries, immigration in Spain is only about 20 years-old and immigrants in Spain are not competing for the jobs held by Spaniards, noted Dowling.

2335,"The basque country is in fact 7 provinces, 4 in Spain (hegoalde) and 3 in France (iparralde). The french basque country is considered a poor region in France, while Hegoalde is clearly among the richest of Spain. On the spanish side, the basque identity is very developped, with signs in basque first and then in spanish, while the order is the opposite in France. Iparralde is not very populated in comparison to Hegoalde, with cities like Bayonne, Biarritz, Anglet, St Jean de Luz altogether amounting for just Donostia, which is smaller than Bilbao, the main city of the Basque country. 
Basque country is very green, and there is a reason for that: the french basque country is the area where it rains the most in all France in terms of quantity, though not in terms of days. Strangely it is also one of the sunniest parts of France. The best time to visit (at least in France) is July August and September, monthes with nice warmth and almost no rain. Last year it basically rained from February to June. 
Though there used to be a lot of independance talks before, they are not predominant anymore, mainly because the main countries gave privileges. The french part is within a much bigger region, Nouvelle Aquitaine, led by Bordeaux, a much bigger city population wise, economically and politically and industrially. 
Many touristic places punctuate the country, a major choke point between France and Spain through history, with castles and military cities in the mountains or on the coast. Forests, beaches, cliffs, moutains, hills : nature too is beautiful. The Spanish city of Bilbao offers a much more modern aspect, with the Guggenheim museum between others. 
There are big projects to bring the spanish and french regions of Nouvelle Aquitaine and Pais.Basco together with the creation of a Euro region and academic and industrial partnerships, construction of transnational train line between Bordeaux and Bilbao.

2410,"OP is a radicalized Croat fascist from Bosnia&amp;Herzegovina. In his title he stated ""poturicenaaparatima"" which would translate to 'TURKS (derogatory ) ON LIFE SUPPORT' insinuating 2 things. 

&amp;#x200B;

A) Bosniaks, a nation of 3 milion people, does not exist but that they (the Bosniaks) are merely confused Croats or Serbs with ideological remnants from the Ottoman occupation. This denial of existence is recognized by international law as a form of ideological genocide which they blatantly carry on doing to this day even here on Reddit. This tactic of nation destruction via negation of existence  was first implemented on Bosniaks during the Austro-Hungarian occupation when in 1905. the Habsburg government outlawed the word Bosniak. This outlaw transfered through 3 governments (dominated by Serbs and Croats) and stood until independence in 1992.

&amp;#x200B;

B) the idea that this election situation is so bad for the Bosniaks that they should be on life support to survive.

&amp;#x200B;

Now as a clearance of a few facts that OP has failed to mention

\-There are over 500,000 Croats living in Bosnia&amp;Herzegovina and on top of that there are at least 300,000 more in mixed families living throughout all of the country as the Constitution guarantees them equal representation in every level of government which ensures government jobs and steady incomes for a lot of Croats.

\-The far right party that OP supports, known as HDZ and their candidate the current Croat member of the tripartite presidency Dragan Čović gathered 120,000 votes whereas the other Croat, Željko Komšić who is an outspoken leftist won 170,000 votes. Added together the votes up to merely half of the Croat voting body. This alleged over-voting by the Bosniaks is all part of their post election damage control propaganda. They want to throw the blame of their poor politics and results on a conspiracy theory of voter fraud. They go as far as to say that Željko Komšić is not a Croat even though he comes from a long line of Croats, alluding that a Croat is only a Croat if he is far right and the HDZ party says you are. 

&amp;#x200B;

The victory of Željko Komšić is a reaction of centrist Croats towards a much too far right swing of the current option. There is a strong mass of people in Bosnia&amp;Herzegovina who want the warmongering rhetoric of ultra-nationalist to fade into the past so that they can live a life unburdened by past sins of their fellow nationals.

2500,"From what I understand (any Irish people feel free to correct), the starvation wasn't due to a shortage in the Irish food market. There was plenty of food outside of the potato crop, and England continued to import it from Ireland.

The mass starvation occurred due to British Penal Laws that restricted Irish Catholics from freeholds on the land that they farmed, so they had few property rights. Penal Law set a precedent for forcing inherited farmland estates to be split between sons, resulting in small packages of land that were not big enough to live off. The potato, being a high-yield crop, was common because of that, and Irish Catholics grew it to feed themselves while selling other crops to pay their landlords.

During the famine, landlords started evicting the farmers because they could no longer pay rent as the working population died. With no land or a way to grow food, they starved.

The Irish, having MPs in Westminster, made some demands to the Prime Minister, including overturning Penal Laws and removing tariffs to lower the price of bread. The PM, Robert Peel, ignored all the demands except for the last. He removed the tariffs in 1846, but that did nothing to help Ireland as Penal Law was what killed them. One million Irish died in total, which can be referred to as a British genocide given the laws that exacerbated the blight, and a further two emigrated over the next decade.

2531,"I agree with you 100 percent RS should go to Serbia. But with Croats its tricky. There is a lot of overlap between the Bosniak and Croat regions so it would be impossible to avoid enclaves or Palestine style geographically separated territories under the same government, which would be a disaster in the Balkans. If BiH was to be partitioned, the solution would either be that Croats learn to live as a minority under rule from Sarajevo, or that Croatia annexes the rest of Bosnia, and the Bosniaks become a minority, although neither are palatable to the ethnic groups and I doubt Croatia would want a large, Muslim, voting population and cities with high unemployment. Another solution would be to create incentives for Croats in encalves to move to Croat majority territory that is not geographically separated to make a Croat entity/ annexation more feasible, similar to the mass migration across Bosnia in the 90s but (hopefully) less rapey   ",,/r/europe/comments/9mfb1y/absurdity_in_bosnias_election_the_croat_member_of/e7fkk54/,merkeljerk,1539055193

In the U.S., there is no legal requirement to have an ID on you at all times, or to have one at all; for this reason, most people who can drive use their driver's license as a photo ID if they need one.  Driver's licenses and state IDs cost money to attain, renew, replace, and covert in the event that you move to a new state.  Needing these to vote is tantamount to a poll tax, which the 24th amendment of the U.S. constitution prohibits.

2593,"1) Yes, of course, let me buy my personal nuclear reactor for the living room. 

Nuclear is waaaaay too expensive to do anything well. It is the costliest form of electricity generation. Unless the nuclear industry manages to lower prices it will go nowhere in the West.

Gas is still producing carbon emissions, and methane itself is a GHG, so it's not a solution.

Electrifying anything that can be electrified is the solution. Renewables are cheap and plentiful. GHG emissions will go from consumption (me consuming for heating) to production of electricity (I consume electricity and do not directly produce any GHG emissions, the electricity provider does, but the electricity provider has an easy way of decarbonizing, installing renewables).

2) Resorting to 100% renewables is not such an impossible task, you just need to spread the generating capacity over a very large area. It's almost always sunny and/or windy somewhere in Europe. And solar and wind seasonally compliment themselves perfectly. And then there's hydropower, and sustainable biomass, two renewables that are stable enough. And then there's batteries for storage, with competitive prices already today. There are studies that show us how to get to very high levels of renewables integration.

But even if this weren't the case, we still have a ton of time before that really becomes a problem. As you've mentioned, we're extremely far away from having very high renewables penetration.

&gt; I'd suggest supporting renewable+nuclear+gas for this is what the most stable and eco-friendly energy system would consist of today.

It could be, if nuclear was anywhere near competitive price-wise with any other source. But it isn't. No one with a sane mind is gonna invest in new nuclear reactors in the West.

&gt; Lobbying for renewables-only would lead to increase in ineffective coal usage (that's why Germany produces twice as much carbon pollution as France)

That's simply not true. Both nuclear and coal usage is falling in Germany. And gas could easily substitute coal, the only reason it doesn't is because of economic and political considerations (Germany has a lot of coal, so coal is cheap, and it doesn't have gas, which would have to be imported from Russia, and god knows we do not want the Poles reading about that and going berserk).
The decision to prematurely close nuclear plants in Germany meant that coal usage fell slower than we'd want, but the power sector in Germany is still performing above the target (doing better than needed). It's the housing and transport sectors that aren't performing as needed. And that's because electrification in those sectors is proceeding much slower than needed.
Also, more than 15GW of coal generating capacity could be retired without any problems in Germany (considering the ever increasing export of electricity that Germany does). The only reason this is not happening is political, again. Coal operators profit from exporting the electricity produced in Germany to other countries, and the German government hasn't done anything about it.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/9md1l4/climate_report_scientists_urge_deep_rapid_change/e7fn4zr/,Etain05,1539058118

2659,"&gt;Cognitively and in communication science it  is. The only place it isn't is in statistics, but while the raw math is  the province of that discipline, the **use** of that math in the real world falls into others.

You use large words without actually communicating much in the way of meaning. What are you trying to say here?

Are you suggesting that we have too small a sample size to make any inferences about which ethnic minorities are committing which crimes? I would strongly contest that.

&gt;**I**  didn't talk about that. I said rate, didn't I? And I said that rates are  calculated based on population sizes, didn't I? Nowhere in the quoted  text did I reference total crime committed or representation therein.  So, you're foiling an argument I didn't make there. I think you know  that too.

No I'm genuinely lost here.

Let me clarify my position:

It is undoubtedly true that different immigrant groups are over-represented in particular types of (often horrific and vile) crimes e.g. FGM, ""grooming"", terrorism.

Due to this those groups most likely to be responsible for those crimes should not be allowed to immigrate to the UK.

You seem to veering into a very clinic discussion of the way numbers are calculated? Or not... as I said I'm pretty lost at this point.

&gt;Since I'm  not sure you're gonna be able to follow, let me paint you a picture. One  man from Thailand moves to a city where no people from Thailand live or  have ever lived. He commits a crime. Let's say the crime is rape. The  rate of rape commission for people from Thailand in that city is now  100%. Is it true though that if you go out into that city that you are  more likely to be criminalized by someone from Thailand? Of course not.  Let's say there were 99 other rapists, of which 96 were white and 3 were  other. Let's say for those 3, given the overwhelming whiteness of this  particular city, they are over-represented in the data. It is  nevertheless true in that situation that you're still more likely to get  victimized by the white people, as they make up the bulk of the crime  (regardless of rates). So any initiative aimed at eliminating crime that  refuses to target that population would, in this example, result in a  total reduction of 4 crimes. This isn't terribly far off from what  you're proposing.

Ok this is much better, and far easier to understand. However I think the point is irrelevant. While it *is true* that a too small sample size **can** produce anomalous results I do not think such reasoning applies to the crimes I am referring to.

There are thousands of FGM cases in the UK ever single year. As far as I am aware close to 100% of the perpetrators of these crimes will be non-White British (specifically they will be central African or middle eastern). To say that these this is too small a distribution to have an accurate picture of what the profile of the avg. FGM enthusiast in the UK looks like is not honest.

The same holds true for something like type2 child grooming - these incidents [aren't isolated](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22617339) by any means. And again, the same holds true for crime in the city of London. The met keep [details statistics](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7856787/Violent-inner-city-crime-the-figures-and-a-question-of-race.html) on the question of which demographics commit which crimes. The data points here will numbers in the 10's of thousands unlike your hypothetical example and it's sample size of 4.

&gt;[Over  70% of arrests made are of white people. This figure beats the next  highest one out by almost an order of magnitude and still suggests  underrepresentation.](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/crime-justice-and-the-law/policing/number-of-arrests/latest) Most of the people arrested are men.  
&gt;  
&gt;So,  if you're interested in prevention, why are you targeting populations  that contribute less to the total pool of crime committed rather than  the population committing most of it? Why not go after the big  offenders?

Because it's perfectly reasonable that in a country where 82% of the population is white British that the *vast majority* of offenders would be white British.

What matters when looking at groups is ***per capita*** crime rates, not the total number. Obviously we shouldn't turn a blind eye to crimes committed by any one, but to try and claim that what's wrong with the UK today is that there's too many Ayran grooming gangs, or Christian suicide bombers, or that inner city crime is ""primarily a white problem"" is to be utterly delusional. In the case of grooming gangs it would be to utterly *invert reality* as in those cases (unlike say inner city violence, which tends to overwhelming black on black) it's the ***victims*** who are almost exclusively white.",Cuck Island,/r/europe/comments/9m9y4j/uk_babies_falling_victim_to_horrific_fgm_in/e7fcmtt/,AceFlashheart,1539047658

So I actually talked about this with an elder female relative; it was actually quite endearing and it shows such a difference of culture; I raised this to this 60 years old female Dutchman who's like ""Ehhh.. that's weird; I don't necessarily agree but I can sort of see it I guess with female life expectancy being higher but still...""; turns out they assumed that males would be retiring earlier than females. Makes me realize I spent too much time on the internet.

60 years old and they live blissfully unaware of how much ""benevolent sexism"" exists in other countries; like they actually made the sensible assumption that males would be retiring sooner because that's obvious as they have a lower life expectancy but I spent enough time on the internet now to realize that all these ""muh treat women like a lady"" cultures would of course let females retire sooner over that bullshit.

Number one, if you dont have an id, that means you dont drive. That already puts you at a disadvantage for getting an ID; it becomes an all day thing because at best you're at the mercy of bus schedules, at worst you bike or walk.

Number two, I dont know about you but here in FL the cost for a basic ID is $25. That is 5 hours pay at minimum wage, after tax. For a poor person, that may mean they have to go without lunch for a week. 

Number 3, what time can you get an ID? 9-5, Monday through Friday. So not only are you paying 5 hours worth, you lose another 8 hours of work. That is a third of your weekly check. People making minimum wage, working paycheck to paycheck, cannot afford that.

2749,"&gt;It's their responsibility to shape the nation.

Yes, and I'm telling you that they are. Fidesz consistently gets the most votes so they must be doing something right. From abroad, it is easy to just go from what you read in western news (which really only just bashes Orban on whatever is the topic of the day). What news usually make it abroad about Hungary rarely influence domestic politics. /I'm assuming you don't live in Hungary./

In reality, people would not vote for them if there was only propaganda with no substance. Like I wrote, generally, things are going good (inflation, income tax, benefits, unemployment etc.) -- people vote based on their wallet. People don't vote for Fidesz because they got a letter from them, or because those billboards were so pretty, they vote because they get more salary, or their kids get more tax benefits, or they could finally find work, or at last their street was repaved. This can also change, like if the EU stops a lot of the money, or there is another economic crisis.

&gt;If they're going to allow themselves to be run over by greedy juggernauts  
&gt;  
&gt;they want to fund their leaders' posh lifestyles

Nobody wants to do that. But. Even with them being so greedy and posh etc., people are better off. So this is not true:

&gt;while they live hand to mouth

Sure you can find groups that live in poor conditions, they simply are not the target population of Fidesz. Those that were clearly disadvantaged by the Fidesz policies, don't vote for them. Fidesz did a good job gauging how they can reach the most people with favourable policies and so ensure that a lot of people vote for them.

&gt;I just find it odd that people are broadly content enough with things that this is fine with them.

Like I said, the general attitude is ""Sure they steal a lot, just like the ones before them, but at least now I have more as well.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Orban's letters to the people to sway their votes just seems a bit odd.

Not sure what info you have about these, but for example I have not received any of those letters. The reason: I did not sign up for them. So while it is convenient to complain about how one is bombarded with government propaganda, people tend to forget that they themselves signed up for it, or that they could just unsubscribe. But I guess then they could not complain about it.

2750,"This is how discussion work. 

You say the list shows antisemitic crimes and I tell you it's tragically incomplete, it only names 3 attacks between 2015 and 2018. 

Of course I knew there were far right attacks there. Note that for the first 20 years of your list, far-right attacks killed no one while islamic terrorism killed dozens in Germany. This is even more than that in France, there have been numerous serious attacks, none by the far-right. Jews are on the brink of voting far-right in France since they have seen the situation worsen around Paris.

I'm not denying far-right antisemitism exists, I say it's the least of the problems for the Jews, especially in their daily live. There aren't forced to change neighborhoods because of nazis. Their children aren't bullied in school by little far-right extremists.

2751,"I love how your argument for “it’s so easy” is literally just your personal experience and a lack of comprehension of the potential for others.

So, [lets look at this study](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/15/do-voter-identification-laws-suppress-minority-voting-yes-we-did-the-research/)

&gt;	First and most important, we have data from the nation’s most recent elections (2006-2014) and can single out and test the effect of the strict voter ID laws in multiple elections and multiple states. (We define states with “strict voter ID laws” as states where residents cannot vote without presenting valid identification during or after the voting process.)

&gt;	Second, we have validated voting data so we know whether each of our respondents actually voted. Third, we have a huge sample — over a third of a million Americans from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study — which means that we can analyze the participation of racial and ethnic minorities in all states both before and after strict ID laws are implemented.

What did they find?

&gt;	When we compare overall turnout in states with strict ID laws to turnout in states without these laws, we find no significant difference. That pattern matches with most existing studies. But when we dig deeper and look specifically at racial and ethnic minority turnout, we see a significant drop in minority participation when and where these laws are implemented.

&gt;	Hispanics are affected the most: Turnout is 7.1 percentage points lower in general elections and 5.3 points lower in primaries in strict ID states than it is in other states. Strict ID laws mean lower African American, Asian American and multiracial American turnout as well. White turnout is largely unaffected.

&gt;	These laws have a disproportionate effect on minorities, which is exactly what you would expect given that members of racial and ethnic minorities are less apt to have valid photo ID.

How many people don’t have ID?:
11% of U.S. citizens – or more than 21 million Americans – do not have government-issued photo identification

So, why don’t people have ID if they are a citizen?

Obtaining ID Costs Money. 
Even if ID is offered for free, voters must incur numerous costs (such as paying for birth certificates) to apply for a government-issued ID, which many of these people do not have.

Underlying documents required to obtain ID cost money, a significant expense for lower-income Americans. The combined cost of document fees, travel expenses and waiting time are estimated to range from $75 to $175.2

The travel required is often a major burden on people with disabilities, the elderly, or those in rural areas without access to a car or public transportation. In Texas, some people in rural areas must travel approximately 170 miles to reach the nearest ID office.

Are they really discriminating?

Minority voters disproportionately lack ID. Nationally, up to 25% of African-American citizens of voting age lack government-issued photo ID, compared to only 8% of whites.

6 States exclude forms of ID in a discriminatory manner. Texas allows concealed weapons permits for voting, but does not accept student ID cards. Until its voter ID law was struck down, North Carolina prohibited public assistance IDs and state employee ID cards, which are disproportionately held by Black voters. And until recently, Wisconsin permitted active duty military ID cards, but prohibited Veterans Affairs ID cards for voting.

What is the harm?

Voter ID laws are a waste of taxpayer dollars. States incur sizeable costs when implementing voter ID laws, including the cost of educating the public, training poll workers, and providing IDs to voters.
Texas spent nearly $2 million on voter education and outreach efforts following passage of its Voter ID law.
Indiana spent over $10 million to produce free ID cards between 2007 and 2010.
Neither found any evidence of a reduction in voter fraud in that time.

Why the paranoia?
Maybe you just can’t be convinced that illegals and convicts aren’t voting illegally despite absolutely zero proof, and maybe your brain just can’t cope with facts.

EU on the other hand has serious xenophobic issues in general, especially on the Eastern  end - again perhaps not too surprising due to all the years spent under occupation and the forced cultural migration. In both cases though I think it tends to be irrational. That irrationality and fear is what also feeds the nationalist parties that are raising their heads in those countries. 

I fully agree with the stated goals that immigration should be controlled, but a blanket ban still isn't the right solution.

I'm from a Eastern European country myself, and an immigrant in the US. Seeing both sides of the story is kind of fascinating, but also saddening.

Summary, it is worse than reprehensible. We would cut our health budget at least in half if we went to single payer univeral.

Medicare/Medicaid is already the worlds largest purchaser of drugs but is banned by Congress from negotiating pricing as an effort to protect profit over human life. Though I'm sure if we allowed them to negotiate today the private system would just get twice as expensive to cover the profit difference, so we really need universal single payer or else it's all fucked.

The Republicans have spent 4 decades sabotaging all US government institutions to justify their ideological philosophy that such programs are best left to the private sector due to ""inefficiencies"" read: taxes on the wealthy.

The majority of Americans want single payer universal, but our system is so broken that matters little. Brett the Rapist just got a lifetime appointment to the supreme court while advocating for making the president able to pardon himself, make the president immune to subpoena and investigation, and directly stating that ""the left"" (as you know America doesn't have a left wing or even centrist party) will face retribution for opposing him. He was appointed by a president who lost the vote by over 3 million and was confirmed by 50 senators who represent 143 million people, opposed by 48 senators who represent 182 million.

But it is *not* my sole responsibility, nor is it it anyone else's sole responsibility, so putting such a loaded question on me is quite frankly absurd  and borderline insulting.

This is not a question of quitting meat entirely, that is the absolute extreme choice for the hardcore crowd who see the world only in black and white. No, this is a question of cutting down on meat consumption to the point where it doesn't hurt the environment any longer. How much that is, I cannot say, but we've been farming animals for millennia, and it's only in the last 100 or so years that the greenhouse gas emissions have gone out of control. Meat went  from being a luxury to being a everyman consumer product. 

Today, there are alternatives like Tofu and vegetarian ""meat"", but neither of those choices appeal to me. And I've tried them. Tomorrow, there will be alternatives like lab grown meat, and the benefits of lab grown meat are quite frankly mind blowing compared to conventional cattle/pork/chicken farming. It's way more efficient, cruelty-free and it doesn't fuck up our antibiotics supplies. The only hurdle left to tackle is to make it cheaper and commercially viable, and of course make it taste and feel like the real thing. But the tech is promising, and as I've said elsewhere, if given the choice, I'd buy the lab grown alternative any day of the week, even if it's more expensive.

Well, our synagogues are protected since the second intifada, schools are protected since the 2012 terrorist attack in Toulouse.

&gt;Yes, there have been attacks. Here is a long list of such attacks after 1945

Your list doesn't mean anything, I typed Germany antisemitic attack in Google and the first page shows 3 serious attacks, all by Muslims, and all during the last 6 months. They don't show up on Wikipedia. [First](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/13/german-police-mistakenly-punch-baltimore-professor-who-was-a-victim-of-anti-semitic-attack/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.c6864b9a5f78), [second](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/19/video-anti-semitic-attack-sparks-outrage-germany/531384002/), [third](https://www.thelocal.de/20180708/german-police-arrest-10-in-alleged-anti-semitic-attack). I have yet to see one physical attack commited by the far right in the same period in Berlin, and they are supposed to be many more. I have also yet to see terrorist attacks on Jewish school, museum, synagogues and gathering by the far right in Europe in the last 50 years.

I'm not saying there are no antisemitic far right attacks in Germany, I'm saying attacks from Muslims are more violent and more frequent. And I'm not the only one saying it.

&gt;Königsberg, the Jewish Community of Berlin's anti-Semitism officer, believes a much larger percentage of anti-Semitic incidents were committed by Muslim extremists.

&gt;""I would say at least five out of ten anti-Semitic incidents have got a Muslim background. Sometimes even more – for example in schools it would be eight out of ten,"" he told DW.

&gt;The reason for the discrepancy, according to Königsberg, is that police are still using outdated classifications which sometimes mark offenses committed by Muslim extremists as simply ""right wing.""

&gt;For example, when participants at a 2016 Salafist rally showed the Nazi salute, ""the police registered it as a far-right, Nazi incident,"" Königsberg told DW.

First of all they were not occupied, there was normal administration, these people were citizens of Poland etc. and it was confirmed by international treaties.

I didn't, my point is Irish isn't special. Sure it's more difficult to learn for an English speaker than German, but it's not that bad, especially when you take into consideration that Irish children learn it from a young age, so as much as they end up not being able to speak it, the basic understanding of the structure is there.

For example, in Irish the verb goes at the start, it's VSO, I reckon most people that have been through the Irish school system that did Irish wouldn't have any problems with that word order. I'd imagine it would be a lot harder for an English English speaker, or an American.

The Koran's antisemitism is prescribed to its adherents. That said Muslims are told that the Koran is the actual word of God and they are to follow it all or else they are non-Muslims. The Christian priests dont tell their adherents this stuff,

&gt; Because there are many, many non-muslim people who support violence against Jews.

3088,"Gosh that's a deep answer that I don't want to fully type out just for time constraint's sake. I'll try to be very brief.

/r/Politics adheres strictly to left-wing ideology that's open, creative, and accepting. It has no hard constraints, and therein lies some danger. Everything the left stands for is *subjective* at its core. What is offensive? What is acceptable? What is the *norm?* Trick questions, they all have the same answer: **there is no definition**. Or rather, the closest definition you can get is ""that which the most-perceived-victimized party deems to be offensive/acceptable/normal"". 

In short: the left supports the most-victimized peoples by letting them define their moral code of acceptance.

The hard part with the left is how do you know when they've gone too far? How *far* can you go in supporting a minority? At what point does it become evil, masked with good intentions? *Trying to point out this line is a sin to this ideology.*

We **know** what going too on the right looks like: racial supremacy, nationalism, and extreme capitalistic tendencies without considerations for others.  
Our problem these days is that we **can not** point out when the left is going too far, because that's politically incorrect.

And **that** is the cause I am against.

Conservative and liberal ideologies are a balancing act with each other. We need to put our countrymen **first**, but not identifying racial divides while doing so. We need to focus on our economy and create a government that gives rise to capitalism, **without** losing sight of those at the bottom. We need to be socially accepting of those who are different, **without** infringing on the rights of others.

&gt;. When Poles have money most built idiotic mansions which cost a fortune in upkeep. They change cars and electronics just cause they can and throw out perfectly good stuff. That is why all authorities say Poland is a risky economy as it is based mainly on consumption. Investment is still not a value here. When you see all those local family companies doong quite well that sold to international ones after say 10 years just for easy large money and look at the family owner ones for generations elsewhere, you can see that the main problem in Poland is mentality and greed of some “elites”. So without the foreign investments and EU the country would probably turn to an oligarchy.

Why the fuck do you care what they use their money for ? The same way you aim for higher salaries the same way the business owners want to reward themselves. It's not like the business suffers from that. It's your attitude that kills your economy not theirs.

This is only partly about ""evil germans"" but more about the sinister minds of corporations.  The chinese and americans are known to be ruthless businessmen but in Europe we (well the westerners) pretend to be something better than the rest of the world. They are not. They are even worse. Fucking despicable evil beings.
They are thieves preaching about laws they break.
The world is not a fair place but dont pretend that poles could have started from the same level like germans or french or dutch because they could not.

The EU is fucking up your competitiveness with the shitty postal workers legislation and some people even clap to that non sense.

You need to find a super niche and profitable industry and be good at it to ever reach the german level. You dont need german stores, banks, french civil engineering companies. You absolutely need to reinvent the wheel and tell them to fuck off.

Poland needs to become a rich and assertive country otherwise the history will repeat once again.

3182,"&gt;  I guess my initial **guess**, that this is something that only affects particular areas, was correct.

That's crucial here. It's personal, anecdotal experience, worth nothing more than mine for example. I commute basically daily (in central europe) and cannot confirm your views. Using those personal judgements (as isolated as you do) as facts is worthless when trying to argue about social aspects.

For example, here barely anyone has enough guts to even ask someone to move a bag (which also contradictory to your statement happens for me around ~60-40 because men, not women, put theirs on a seat). Further I have never heard anyone ask someone else to close their legs to make more room in public transport; not even to mention that the word ""manspreading"" isn't even part of the vocabulary of the ones having a good/decent grasp of the english language.

I could argue that your experience is wrong, purposely mispresented as fact and so on, but it's simply anecdotal evidence proving nothing and contributing little without context of opinions. Just like my previous passage.  
So one cannot argue about a whole social phenomenon (existing or not) by solely bringing up personal experience. Looking at single, exclusive viewpoints is in itself not social. For one of those single experiences to have any meaning at all in social context you have to compare it to as many opinions of the same area and commuting time, creating social ground in the first place (social never refers to distanced onlookers, but involved partakers in a common system of plenty of other individuals - here commuters of same place and time - you are not involved if you disregard/don't include those others; you act as a ""mere"" part of the whole that itself has to be analyzed yet to grant any meaningful insight, leaving in its current state no valuable conclusion for the social context itself).

The only factual point you can make with a statement like this is in regards to the history and perception of /u/PlausibleApprobation or  /u/MisterTrizeps and so on. One can argue, for example, that based on the things the commentator noticed his view appears to be so and such. A study of an individual. Nothing social is yet gained by solely relying on this one view. But the social aspect is necessary when argueing about an alleged social phenomenon.

As a sidenote: to be fair it may be argueable how social scientists have to conduct their research. It should be clear I personally stray away from Weber's conception and understand it closer to critical theorists, argueing in favour of involvement, not against it.",,/r/europe/comments/9mcuy2/viral_manspreading_video_is_staged_kremlin/e7e6o95/,MisterTrizeps,1539009963

You'd think that the scam costs the carmakers money but at the end they'll sell new cars and sell the old cars to other parts of the planet, on top. 

Even more so as the government wants to pay billions to switch all (government) city diesel cars, construction cars, buses and transporter in large cities. They plan on paying 80% of the costs, for around 100k-200k vehicles. This will be more effective to make the air clean inside cities, but costs us even more money and AGAIN will fill the pockets of carmakers. What a good punishment for lying.

Then hard way, experienced that there is certain difference between theory and practice.

Now Bosniaks spread same bullshit around, with only one difference, which is package.

They want country of the people, civil state. This dude, Bosniak Komsic, who is elected as Croatian president of B-H, calm dead yesterday says: ""Dear Croats, I know that Bosniaks elected me, but hey I'm your president now. And that's it."" And I'm thinking. This is surreal. This man is retarded, no other explanation for this behavior. Test your win, pay visit to some major Croatian towns then. Yea right.

Why da hell did he and other Bosniaks fought against civil state in '90s, anyway, which was Yugoslavia. If he(they) wants civil state. Why he fought against army of civil state? Does he and they remember what was question on the referendum then? No civil state and Serbian type politics for sure. Why not stay as member of that?    
No war. You are part of civil state. Serbs would still be main guys around. But as you are saying, it's not an issue for you.

Seriously. Nobody's fucking blind.
You want change, be that change. No. Off course they would not, just like Serbs didn't in Yugoslavia. They have same vision of changes. It's over back of the others.

I'd support them. Chose Komsic as Bosniak member of the presidency.    
You'd show everybody how progressive you are.    
But, as Bosniak member won Dzaferovic, and SDA party. Beside everything Turkish and Arab lapdogs. They kicked asses of other parties, again. So claimed most hated Bosniak party, with thesis where they almost don't have any supporters, easily wins another term.

I hope so.

Saying that there are some who have very narrow room to navigate and this change very little for their position. Namely Belarus, Eastern Ukraine, Lithuania maybe Latvia. Bordering Romania, friendly Czechia and Slovakia plus having shore of Baltic and Black Sea make such entity perfect blocker for western expansion of RF.

3750,"A TFR of 2.1 only produces a stable population over the long run.

Why doesn't it immediately take effect?  Because Poland was growing up until 1990, and was still running off that past high fertility.  Fertility rates don't have full effect on population change until you've held it constant for a whole lifetime.

Here's the history of Poland's TFR.

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=PL

Up until about 1970, Poland had a high enough fertility rate to be growing considerably beyond just maintaining population.

In 1989, fertility dropped again, well below replacement rate.

So, yeah, there are few babies entering the population per woman in 1990.  *But* remember that there are also few people dying off and lots of women in childbearing age having those few babies.  The people dying off from old age in Poland in 1990 were maybe born in, say the 1920s.  And Poland was a smaller country then.

This is what population cohorts in Poland looked like in 1990:

https://www.populationpyramid.net/poland/1990/

There are about 1.8 million Poles who are 60-64, one generation back.  Those people are getting close to dying off from old age.

There are about 3.2 million Poles who are 30-34, the generation *having* kids now.  So even though that younger generation doesn't have many per woman, the greater numbers of mothers mean that there are more babies entering the population than old people dying off.

The problem is that eventually, the bill for not having enough kids must come due.  Poles have been below replacement since 1990, at their present level since ~2000.  A woman born in 1990 might be having kids now, in 2018...but because *her* mother didn't have many daughters, there aren't as many Polish women in the world to have that new generation of babies.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9m5p3v/more_than_402000_children_were_born_in_poland_in/e7dh1fw/,vokegaf,1538970150

Not really. Both Poland and Hungary want migrants out of EU. Sending them away from Italy is a common point here.

So Salvini can crack down on NGO's and EE will support him and try to shield him from EU anger.

The only long-term solution is to take away HOPE from those people that they would make their lives in EU. They must be 100% sure  that they will be deported back.

Maybe Bulgaria would have went with entering ww1 the same way that it did but our little blunder made sure they would declare on us sooner or later. Than Turtucaia happened (it remains to this day one of the most shamefull defeats in Romanian history). You guys took up place in Casa Capsa (our fav restaurant in Bucharest) Some soldiers got drunk and tried to steal some holy relics, god knows why. But i guess if that is all that is remembered about the bulgarian soldiers stationed in Bucharest in ww1, relations were quite friendly. No horror stories here. I could not say the same about the Romanian colonisation of Dobrogea, or the deportations.



After ww1 there were some ""population exchanges"" or deportations. WWII followed and made it so that literally only the serbs (until 1989 everybody in Romania called all the yugos, serbs, don't really know why) and poles were not out to get us.  We had to live with the same strategic map. As more and more countries signed on for one side or the other Romania's neutrality could not last for long. And Bulgaria would once again declare on us. It did not eventually, but did regain its former clay through a treaty. 





There were people that changed their name to remain in Romania for personal reasons, others that were deported to Bulgaria by the Romanian authorities even if they were here long before the balkan wars or ww. There were some broken up families in the villages around Bucharest. There are still a lot of bulgarians in Popesti Leordeni. One of the few places bulgarian is still spoken. At least among the elders. I don't know if they moved there from Dobrogea or they were already there but they do have a church and everything so i would bet on them being an older comunity.

3808,"Yeah, it is a tad complex, but ridiculously interesting. 

There are only 3 countries in the world which have a non-codified constitution, that being the UK, New Zealand and Israel. What that means is that there is no one document you can point to as our 'constitution', but it does exist with many sources. This is basically because in the last 1000 years the UK hasn't had a proper revolution, or an overturn of government without any continuity. There are significant benchmarks, like Magna Carta in 1215 which made Parliament permanent, the Bill of Rights in 1688 which severely curtailed the powers of the monarch, the Parliament Acts in 1911 and 1949 which took away the veto powers of the House of Lords - but none of these things totally removed the old system, or led to us needing to sit down and codify the constitution, so it remains in its uncodified form.

A large part of this is 'precedent', which is generally unwritten. For example parliament being sovereign, the monarch not using veto powers, the existence of the Prime Minister etc. None of these things are explicitly written in a document anywhere, but they are an obvious part of the constitution.

In addition to that you have statute law. In other countries constitutional law is above normal law, but in the UK it is not so. Although this has evolved in recent years, with things like the Human Rights Act (coming from the European Convention of Human Rights). If a piece of law conflicts with it, judges can't strike it down but issue a 'decree of incompatibility', effectively saying ""you need to either remove this new law or remove the Human Rights Act"". In practice the new law is always changed, just like it would in a system where constitutional law has privilege over normal law, but it still technically abides by the framework of the old system.

There is many more elements to it, but if you have any questions about it feel free to ask.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/9m2jzz/thousands_march_through_edinburgh_to_back/e7d6wsi/,tyroncs,1538959970

Ineed. Nevetheless the text I posted should have made apparent to you that you only care about self determination when it fits your narrative, after WW1 when it had already been a part Germany for a while. In accordance to self determination Gdansk would not have been taken from Poland in the first place and Poland would not have been robed of its independance. Thus was the purpose of that text. But you'll not go down that route, I am sure.

This could have been apparent to you if you were approaching this issue on an honest footing, which unfortunately you are not.

You do what you must, your captors will no doubt be unforgiving if you dont.

A minority problem is to be removed by removing the minority**."" The authors believe that this goal is theoretically justified by a doctrine according to which Roma represent a declining ethnic group destined for extinction.

Did you hear that on Italian government TV? 

Of the 154,257 decisions on asylum requests between January and August 2018 Germany granted refugee status or asylum in 26,921 cases. That's 17.5%. So much for ""only actual refugees"". 

An additional 17,499 people (11.3%) received subsidiary protection, e.g. because they were from a country at war but not persecuted. 


And how the fuck is Germany choosing the people who request asylum here?

Ultimately the President, Sovereign or Head of State are the symbol of the country.

There is a power in this and that's why populists like Macron are using the metaphorical garb of monarchs to influence. 

It's best you keep those roles seperate. So for example in Britain our PMs get very little respect. They're hounded by press and people don't feel undue reverance for them. They're treated harsh but fair.

4143,"&gt; Greens were weak even before the rise of the Pirates, maybe not so much on the municipal level, but definitely on the regional and state level so the trend just follows with these municipal elections...I think it would have happened even without the rise of the Pirates.

I mean municipal level, yes. 

&gt; To be honest, I think ČSSD is in a very bad situation, I do not envy them. ANO firstly canabilized on disappointed right-wing voters but then moved more centre/centre-left which left ODS a breathing space and possibility to recover. ČSSD does not have this possibility. Thus they tried actively fighting ANO last electoral period and that backfired horribly. Now they are attempting the other option, but honestly I do not think it will work well for them either. And like you, I am not thrilled about their situation either.

Yeah, I can't see what can they do to improve their situation. Going under Zeman won't help them, SPO be the example. Left and moderately conservative is where ANO rules. Going Dienstbier won't bring them enough voters. 

&gt; And possibly also the demographic developments, i.e. they are simply dying out?

Maybe, maybe not. Since they demonstrated more or less stable results in all previous elections since the fall of communism, I used to think their replacement rate is sufficient to stay there forever. Maybe I was wrong and they just got old and died. ",Nejzapadnější země východní Evropy ,/r/europe/comments/9m3z5l/czech_municipal_and_senate_elections_ano_wins_in/e7chrl9/,Slusny_Cizinec,1538937937

4245,"We had at least 3 cases of stolen bridges in Poland over the last 15 years:

&gt; Two men stole a bridge in southwest Poland and sold it for scrap, Wroclaw region police said on Monday.
The bridge, used by a local mine, was sawn up into several sections and taken to a scrap metal recycling point in a truck.
The thieves were apprehended by accident. They were making the last “run” when their truck broke down.

&gt; Police officers from Kruszwica (kujawsko-pomorskie province) are looking for thieves who stole a bridge over the drainage canal in nearby Bachorze. The thieves came for several nights in a row and turned off the next parts. They took away 60 concrete slabs, and later the steel frame of the bridge.

&gt; The stolen steel bridge, 200 metres long and weighing 360 tonnes, was found by the Gdańsk police at a wholesale scrap metal purchase point on the premises of the Port of Commerce in Gdańsk. Most of the found bridge has already been cut into about one-meter long fragments. The bridge, worth over PLN 1.8 million, was stolen at the beginning of August from the protected area of one of Gdańsk's companies, which stored it in parts on behalf of a company from Warsaw. Thieves had to use 15 lorries to transport the bridge as a whole.

Water, sure I agree. There's plenty of ways to get that in Africa, if not then you have overpopulation to blame.

Electricity? Not so much. Having access to iPhone isn't something we must provide for people..

Food? Well yeah, there's plenty of that in Africa, again - overpopulation to blame if not.

Many nations/ethnic groups are still alive that have lost lands and that alone should not give sufficient grounds to take back the land by force or even an international court. If you just meant that this is a necessary, and not a sufficient condition for a claim then I agree. But even here, Constantinople/Istanbul has changed so much since Greek times (and even since the 1920 and 1970s) that it would be misleading to say that Greeks can claim to have ""built"" what Istanbul is today. Of course, much of the historical value of the city is Greek, but almost none of the current infrastructure, housing stock, office buildings, etc., are. Over 14 million people live there today, and even at the peak it was only about half a million Greeks (which of course was a huge number in ancient or medieval times). 

I'm not trying to be a dick. It's just that whatever principles would be used to justify Turkey giving back (by force, ultimately) that city  would also justify using force or threat of force to give back land in many other cases as well, and global war would result.

4344,"I pointed out major similarities between Czech parties and major political points of the AfD. And I never said you accused me of being a Nazi, but bringing up Nazi Germany in any discussion is just bound to happen when one party runs out of arguments and that’s just what I did. Amazing projection in regards to „issues with processing information“ here. 

I have given you six major policy points of the AfD, the ones usually understood to be their major talking points. Do you want to dispute that the three Czech parties I singled out share almost all of them? What kind of „sources“ do you want even? If you want a scientific comparison, written by a respected scholar, I will have to disappoint you, that does not exist at this point. I simply compare party programs, that’s not enough or what? I could have posted some link to them there as well, would that suddenly be acceptable for you then? A lot of times, my sources are also just called „reality“. If you don’t believe me ODS shared the parliamentary group with AfD until they went out of the European Parliament, that’s literally one wiki search away. As a Czech, you should know about Zeman yourself.  You don’t believe he basically campaigns for the AfD in Bavaria? Just google Zeman/Bystron. It’s not hard. For me, this screams „I won’t accept anything that disputed my world view, and to make me look more impartial, I will whine about a lack of sources“.  It’s becoming quite common on Reddit. 

Okay, let’s talk about sources then. Where am I incorrect. For someone so staunchly opposed to the idea that AfD policy is political mainstream in your country, it’s strange that you have not been able to disprove any of my points. You say you don’t want to, yet you keep commenting. All you say is that I am using incorrect information. I will make it easy for you: just name one piece of incorrect information written down by me so far. Let’s start there.

And no, references to specific fringe nationalistic bullshit doesn’t suddenly distinguish the AfD from Czech right-Wing parties.

If I understood right then then this is pretty common. I need to look up the rules but if I take my social security from the US into Sweden I believe I will be taxed on this for the same reason whereas maybe Portugal would be more relaxed and say no to taxing my foreign income. This would make Portugal a more attractive retirement country for me.  This strategy would ideally benefit the economy more if the exemption attracts more pensioners that also spend more.

In '95 when Croatian army was poised to retake occupied areas, Serbs told their people to leave because Croats will kill them all which is utter bullshit. If you want to understand mentality of Serb leadership at the time you need look no further than the concept of lebensraum. They took Serb majority areas in Croatia under logic of ""we're majority here, we should run this place"". Once they realized they won't be able to run it (as we were about to take it back), they decided they would rather have their people in their own land then let them be a minority in Croatia.

4416,"I think that reality is somewhere in the middle.

At one hand I find that teen girls dressing like prostitutes is a bad thing, for several reasons. At the other hand, I find men who don't respect the sovereignty of women's bodies pathetic.

I mean... During the summer I was on a popular square in central Athens (Syntagma Square). I sat on a bench to wait until the person I had an appointment with arrives. And a bunch of teens came standing in front of me. One of these teen girls was standing with her back towards me, about 1-2 meters in front of me, and she was wearing tight ""sorts"" that were only covering with cloth half her ass, and the other half of her ass was nude for everyone to see, at the same height as my head, just a meter in front of me.

That made me way too uncomfortable. I had a live soft porn image right in front of me, without ever asking for it. I was forced to have a teen girl's ass in the center of my view plane, half of it nude, in a distance I could touch it by extending my arm. 

This kind of teasing should not be allowed. I shouldn't be forced to have live softcore (or hardcore) porn images in front of me while in public places. What did I did ? How I reacted ? I tried to focus on the music that I had playing on my phone, I tried hard to ignore the... ass, but I couldn't. It made me weak. It made me unable to concentrate to whatever it was that I was doing. Thankfully I'm a rather self-controlled guy, and I can force cold logic to overpower sentiment and instincts, way more than anyone else I know. So I didn't interacted in a way with her. I tried to pretend that everything was OK, yet I was feeling terribly inside, and I couldn't not look at her ass,  even if I wanted to. If it was someone else, he would probably have interacted with her in some way. Insult her and call her names, or perceive this as an invitation for something, and move on...

PS. Her ass was perfect. Round shape, neither too large or too thin.

The one who moved until 1948 were fleeing the Red Army or were kicked out by the newly formed government for supporting the Nazis (for example, the Benes Decree in Czechoslovakia).

Hehe, some more Nazi German propaganda. You surely do realize that you are not exactly supporting whatever your case is by repeating those 1930s talkimg points, do you?

A full-fledged Slavic town, comparable with other Slavic towns from that period such as Gniezno, Poznań, Kruszwica, Płock or Kraków already existed there for more than three centuries, before Teutonic knights conquered it, controlled it for a while (140 years), and then the city returned under control of Poland for further three and a half of century, during which it experienced the most of its development, and all-high of its importance.

&gt;Danzig was always an ethnic German city.

That is, for the period where it wasn't.

And for a ""German"" city it surely belonged to any of the millions of statelets you Germans managed to develop throughout the history for suspiciously short time.

4541,"So far New conservatives, Nationalists and Unity have announced that they are willing to take all offers, except Harmony. KPV LV and New conservatives have both announced they want to lead (they're the second after Harmony percentualy and by number of seats, respectively). Doesn't seem like ~~Green farmers~~, Development/For! and ~~Harmony~~ have made any announcments after the results came out. ~~Given past trends, however, Green farmers likely also are willing to talk to anyone as their only agenda is being in power and Harmony knows it will be left out and is preparing to rant.~~ I think I saw something about Development/For! wanting to open talks with Unity first yesterday, but I can't find it anymore. EDIT: Greens have announced that they won't talk to Harmony and that Conservatives and KPV LV should take the lead. Harmony has announced that it expects Unity, Development/For! and New Conservatives to be forming the government and suggested they take in Nationalists as well

Development/For! consists of off-shoots of Unity and one of it's predecesor parties. They'll probably get along. 

New conservatives and to extent KPV LV run on anti-corruption platform as did Unity in the past.

New conservatives and National alliance have simmilar ideologies, although the later is more radical Kremlin style conservativism. 

Speaking of which, New conservatives, Unity and Development/For! are pro-EU.

I think (and hope) that it is likely that New Conservatives, Development/For! and Unity can get along despite some ideological and personal differences between them, this would be 37 seats. They are not going to take in Harmony, so that leaves them with three options - KPV LV with +16 seats (that's 53, which would be majority government) +13 seats of Nationalists (creating equal split between position and opposition) and Green farmers with +11 seats (48, which is not enough for stable, majority government).  So a logical scenario is as always take Nationalists and Green farmers and leave KPV LV in opposition with Harmony. Or they could cut these two loose since they are corrupt and somewhat anti-EU/NATO and take KPV LV. EDIT: It's also posible to take KPV LV and either Greens or Nationalists, of course, it just not mathematically necessary to get over 50. In this scenarion probably Greens are more likely to get left out as among rest of the parties some are somewhat nationalistic, but most are anti-corruption

In fairness, the SNP's vision of a Currency Union was heavily biased and would have been pretty insane for the remaining UK to agree to. 

Salmond (the SNP's leader) sold it as if it would be a union between two equals (ie. The UK's central bank has a Monetary Policy Committee of 9 people, so Scotland should get to choose 4/5 of those?), which obviously doesn't make any sense when the UK is ~10x the size and GDP of Scotland. 

The alternative would be to weight the union by population... But Scotland having 1/9 of the Committee isn't really of any benefit to Scotland, since they make decisions by vote. Having 8/9 members voting in one country's interest and 1/9 voting in another's doesn't make sense.

Politics:

- **Interior Minister resigned. Another government reshuffle announced in a couple of days.**

-This is the 7th Minister to resign since the beginning of Macron's mandate 15 months ago. The 3rd in 6 weeks. (Environment Minister Hulot -for political reasons- &amp; Sports Minister Flessel -for judicial problems- in late August ; 4 others were forced to resign also for judicial 'problems' right after being nominated in June of 2017). 

-This resignation was a shit show, again. (Hulot -at the environment- surprised everyone by announcing his resignation live on the radio as the government was coming back from their summer break). Collomb -at the Interior- resigned... *twice* this week: the first time, Macron refused it. Two days later he made his announcement by giving an interview while the government was in the National Assembly doing their weekly Q&amp;As with the MPs. The Prime Minister learnt about it there, live on tv.  

-Why did he resign? Because he wants to be reelected mayor of the city of Lyon. That's where he made his political career for decades (he's 71). (The municipal elections will take place in 2020. Several current Ministers and Secretaries of State have -openly or subtly- revealed that they intend to be candidates, thus leaving their roles of Ministers before the end of their terms). Collomb kept talking about it and it was *weird* to have a Minister announcing he would be leaving in about 10 months to campaign for another seat (especially for such an important and sensitive ministry: how do you expect to be taken seriously if everyone knows you'll be leaving soon and you're focused on your city?)

-His departure speech was surreal: he seemed to be campaigning for the ""Rassemblement National"" Party (former ""National Front"", they changed their name a few months ago). He talked about islamist terrorism and the ""no longer Republican suburbs"" as if civil war was about to happen. (Last month he gave a press conference to give the statistics of delinquancy and patted himself on the back stating that most of the figures are improving, except the ones regarding violence against women). 

-So a reshuffle will be announced tomorrow or the next day. Other ministers are expected to be let go, it should be a large one. (New Interior Minister, but also probably a new Minister of Culture -because the current one also has judicial problems... running theme- and Agriculture -the current one is simply bad and has no charisma. Maybe others). 

- **Emmanuel Macron, to a retired woman with a pension of 500 euros: ""The French complain too much"".** 

-This was during celebrations for the 60th anniversary of our current Constitution (60 years of the Vth Republic). The woman complained about the (small) pensions of farmers and he replied: ""De Gaulle's grandson just told me that his grandfather had this rule: 'You can speak freely, the only thing one doesn't have the right to do is complain'. I think this was good practise by the General [de Gaulle]. You know, the country would be better off if we behaved like that. We are living older and older in good health in our country.""

-The same day he also said that ""those who want a VIth Republic simply do not like the State"". [In reference to politicians, mostly on the far left, who campaign(ed) for a new Constitution]. 

- **Two pictures of Emmanuel Macron were widely commented**.

[This one](https://cdn.static01.nicematin.com/media/npo/mobile_1440w/2018/10/macron-saint-martin-e1538457043303.jpg) and [this one](https://photos.lci.fr/images/613/344/macron-saint-martin-0afea5-0@1x.jpeg).

4627,"Countries are undercutting each other to lure elderly foreigners with money to spend

WHEN the financial crisis hammered Portugal’s economy, hundreds of thousands of its people left, taking advantage of the European Union’s rules on free movement to find work in countries that were hit less hard. Now Portugal is welcoming older people going in the other direction, not for jobs but for a warm, cheap retirement. Well-off baby-boomers are flocking to Lisbon, Sintra and the Algarve, drawn in part by Portugal’s tax exemptions on foreign income. Under its non-habitual-residency scheme, pensions from abroad can be drawn tax-free for a decade.

Bilateral double-taxation agreements are intended to ensure that income does not end up being taxed twice. But some countries, seeking to boost domestic demand by luring wealthy immigrants, have arranged matters so that they can avoid paying any tax on income earned outside their country of residence, such as pensions, capital gains and rent. To qualify, foreign pensioners who move to Portugal need only stick around for six months a year and register as tax-resident.

Portugal is not the only EU country where foreign pensioners can find a sweet deal. France taxes some pensions taken as a lump sum at 7.5%; with judicious use of private health insurance, pensioners can also avoid paying the social charges of 9.1% normally levied on pensions. Malta exempts pensions of up to €13,200 ($15,200) from tax altogether, with a flat rate of 15% above that. State pensions are often excluded from generous exemptions but Cyprus taxes all pensions at 5%, making it particularly attractive for retired civil servants. It also allows people to withdraw their entire pension pots as a lump sum tax-free.

Governments elsewhere are cross about being undercut. Portugal’s most vocal critics are the Nordics. Finland shredded its tax agreement with Portugal in June. If Portugal does not accept a draft deal letting Finland tax most pensions drawn by its retirees there by November, it will start doing so anyway in January. It estimates that it loses a mere €3m-6m a year in revenue to Portugal, but says that as a matter of principle it can no longer tolerate “tax refugees”. This is just sour grapes, says Pekka Pystynen, a retired former executive. Mr Pystynen spends his winters in his home in the Algarve and the summers at his cottage in Finland. The tax benefits were a bonus, he says, but the main draws were the weather and relaxed lifestyle.

Pensioners are important to Portugal’s tourism industry, which contributed over 17% to the country’s GDP in 2017. One job in five is linked to tourism. The average pension paid to Finns living in Portugal is around €3,500 a month. Since prices are a fifth lower than the euro-area average, that goes a long way. According to Sirpa Uimonen of the University of Helsinki, Finns living in the Algarve spend €14,700 a year on average, over 20% more than locals do.

Withdrawing from double-taxation agreements is rare. Denmark ended its deals with Spain and France in 2009, also because of rows about pensions. In the case of Portugal, other countries may follow Finland’s lead. Sweden’s finance minister has pressed to do so. More commonly, countries take matters into their own hands. France is about to start taxing French pensions that are paid abroad. And a new bilateral agreement means that Britain will soon start taxing British government-service pensions drawn in Cyprus.

Portugal’s generosity to retired foreigners has been criticised by locals. They pay up to 48% on their pensions; property prices rose by 10% last year. Extra demand from foreign buyers will not have helped. One political party, the Left Bloc, has proposed closing the pensions loophole. Retired foreigners may soon have to decide whether vinho verde and pasteis de nata are enough of a draw.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9m3pnz/loopholes_allow_some_pensioners_in_the_eu_to/e7bnplu/,Lolkac,1538902026

But what is the report about? None of these comments care and in fact they want to downplay and force people to avoid reading the real words instead of their right wing talking points. 


&gt; Ms. Bennoune said Poland was currently experiencing political and cultural polarization, with a Government trying to promote cultural expressions which reflect its worldview. She described the effort as “regressive cultural engineering” and criticised the use of the term “anti-Polish”, where it was being applied to those whose viewpoints differ from that of the Government.
&gt; 
&gt; The Special Rapporteur testified to the vibrant and diverse cultural life she experienced during her visit, adding that “Polish identity does not belong to any one group, or any one opinion bloc alone, but to all the citizens of Poland.”
&gt; 
&gt; Some far-right nationalist groups, Christian fundamentalist groups and media outlets, she said, are becoming increasingly prominent and aggressive: she also expressed concern about the apparent normalization of these views, with some government officials expressing them without suffering any consequences.
&gt; 
&gt; The statement noted survey data indicating that an increase in hate speech of an open and public nature, in particular of an anti-semitic nature, may be attributed to amendments to Poland’s Law on the Institute of National Remembrance, in February 2018.
&gt; 
&gt; “In view of the upcoming 100th anniversary of Polish independence in November 2018, an event about which many Poles have understandably strong feelings of pride, I call on the Government to take steps to ensure that this significant event is marked in ways that include, rather than exclude, and that do not equate discrimination with patriotism,” Bennoune said.
&gt; 
&gt; Other areas of concern noted by the Special Rapporteur were, she said, the reaffirmation of “stereotypical cultural attitudes” towards women seen during the national debate over changing the abortion law, and the lack of specific legal protection for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender persons (LGBT).
&gt; 
&gt; Although Poland has a strong record of ratifying international human rights and culture accords, she said, more needs to be done to effectively implement such standards in practice.

Absolutely spot on description of the exploitation of cultural polarizations and division to promote the government. 

&gt; Ms. Bennoune said Poland was currently experiencing political and cultural polarization, with a Government trying to promote cultural expressions which reflect its worldview. She described the effort as “regressive cultural engineering” and criticised the use of the term “anti-Polish”, where it was being applied to those whose viewpoints differ from that of the Government.
&gt; 
&gt; The Special Rapporteur testified to the vibrant and diverse cultural life she experienced during her visit, adding that “Polish identity does not belong to any one group, or any one opinion bloc alone, but to all the citizens of Poland.”
&gt; 
&gt; Some far-right nationalist groups, Christian fundamentalist groups and media outlets, she said, are becoming increasingly prominent and aggressive: she also expressed concern about the apparent normalization of these views, with some government officials expressing them without suffering any consequences.
&gt; 
&gt; The statement noted survey data indicating that an increase in hate speech of an open and public nature, in particular of an anti-semitic nature, may be attributed to amendments to Poland’s Law on the Institute of National Remembrance, in February 2018.

&gt; 
&gt; Other areas of concern noted by the Special Rapporteur were, she said, the reaffirmation of “stereotypical cultural attitudes” towards women seen during the national debate over changing the abortion law, and the lack of specific legal protection for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender persons (LGBT).

Then go up further and be in awe about how China nearly doubles the US emissions.

4990,"Far right provocative white genocide people, Soros is paying people to read the article. You get 20 Soroeuro if you read the article. Here let me help you. 

This is spot on and this is the reason the people in this thread are attacking the source and posting strawman and talking about Polish ethnicity because they want to distract people from actually reading the article. 

&gt; Ms. Bennoune said Poland was currently experiencing political and cultural polarization, with a Government trying to promote cultural expressions which reflect its worldview. She described the effort as “regressive cultural engineering” and criticised the use of the term “anti-Polish”, where it was being applied to those whose viewpoints differ from that of the Government.
&gt; 
&gt; The Special Rapporteur testified to the vibrant and diverse cultural life she experienced during her visit, adding that “Polish identity does not belong to any one group, or any one opinion bloc alone, but to all the citizens of Poland.”
&gt; 
&gt; Some far-right nationalist groups, Christian fundamentalist groups and media outlets, she said, are becoming increasingly prominent and aggressive: she also expressed concern about the apparent normalization of these views, with some government officials expressing them without suffering any consequences.
&gt; 
&gt; The statement noted survey data indicating that an increase in hate speech of an open and public nature, in particular of an anti-semitic nature, may be attributed to amendments to Poland’s Law on the Institute of National Remembrance, in February 2018.
&gt; 
&gt; “In view of the upcoming 100th anniversary of Polish independence in November 2018, an event about which many Poles have understandably strong feelings of pride, I call on the Government to take steps to ensure that this significant event is marked in ways that include, rather than exclude, and that do not equate discrimination with patriotism,” Bennoune said.
&gt; 
&gt; Other areas of concern noted by the Special Rapporteur were, she said, the reaffirmation of “stereotypical cultural attitudes” towards women seen during the national debate over changing the abortion law, and the lack of specific legal protection for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender persons (LGBT).
&gt; 
&gt; Although Poland has a strong record of ratifying international human rights and culture accords, she said, more needs to be done to effectively implement such standards in practice.

5000,"The turnout yesterday was very low, but since it is a two-day referendum, much more people will vote on the second day than the first. To see how many, let's compare the situation of this referendum with the last constitutional referendum in Romania to be held in two different days, in 2003.

In the first day of the referendum in 2003, the turnout was **14.29%**. In the second day it reached **55.7%** (the threshold was 50%).

Following the same logic (so the same first day - second day ratio), for this referendum to reach the threshold of 30%, it would need to have a turnout of **7.7%** on the first day. The turnout today was **5.72%**, so lower.

However, there are two reasons that make me believe (or at least accept the possibility) the threshold will be reached:

1. **Church service** - most religious groups will have church service on Sunday. This means that many people will also vote then since they are going out of their homes anyway, which they might have not done on Saturday.

Religious groups are among the strongest supporters of this referendum and politics in Romanian churches is nothing unusual, so **it is highly likely that many priests and pastors will suggest or urge people to go vote**.

This is relevant because the 2003 referendum was about harmonization of national legislation with EU and NATO treaties, so the church had nothing to do with that, whereas here they have a strong word to say, which might drive up the Sunday voting.

Another reason more people might vote today is that the first-day turnout was almost twice as high in urban areas than in rural areas, and inhabitants of the latter tend to be more religious and follow the church's indications. So basically **the rural areas haven't seriously started voting yet**.

2. **Risk of fraud** - the Romanian government, which strongly supports the referendum, passed an emergency ordinance in September which changed the law with regard to the counting of turnout and votes. Now **the number of signatures on the turnout lists do not need to be equal to the number of ballots** anymore, meaning the voting center supervisors could technically tick random names off lists and make them count as if the respective people showed up and gave blank votes (so counting towards turnout, which is what is relevant). This referendum will also have **no possibility of being electronically monitored**.

Voting is always controversial in Romania and there's always allegations of fraud, but due to these two measures this particular referendum is even more dubious than usual elections.",,/r/europe/comments/9lw56k/romanian_referendum_to_constitutionally_prohibit/e7b0ofx/,AccruedExpense,1538873531

Karima Bennoune is the author of Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here: Untold Stories from the Fight Against Muslim Fundamentalism

&gt; In Lahore, Pakistan, Faizan Peerzada resisted being relegated to a “dark corner” by staging a performing arts festival despite bomb attacks. In Senegal, wheelchair-bound Aissatou Cissé produced a comic book to illustrate the injustices faced by disabled women and girls. In Algeria, publisher Omar Belhouchet and his journalists struggled to put out their paper, El Watan (The Nation), the same night that a 1996 jihadist bombing devastated their offices and killed eighteen of their colleagues. In Afghanistan, Young Women for Change took to the streets of Kabul to denounce sexual harassment, undeterred by threats. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, Abdirizak Bihi organized a Ramadan basketball tournament among Somali refugees to counter the influence of Al Shabaab. From Karachi to Tunis, Kabul to Tehran, across the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, and beyond, these trailblazers often risked death to combat the rising tide of fundamentalism within their own countries.
&gt; But this global community of writers, artists, doctors, musicians, museum curators, lawyers, activists, and educators of Muslim heritage remains largely invisible, lost amid the heated coverage of Islamist terror attacks on one side and abuses perpetrated against suspected terrorists on the other.
&gt; 
&gt;A veteran of twenty years of human rights research and activism, Karima Bennoune draws on extensive fieldwork and interviews to illuminate the inspiring stories of those who represent one of the best hopes for ending fundamentalist oppression worldwide.

In 2014, Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here won the Dayton Literary Peace Prize for non-fiction. It was also selected as the best social science book of 2013 by the American Library Association’s Booklist.  The first TED talk based on the book—“When People of Muslim Heritage Confront Fundamentalism”—has garnered over 1.3 million views.

Karima Bennoune is a professor of international law at the University of California–Davis School of Law. She grew up in Algeria and the United States and now lives in northern California.

The topic of Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here is a very personal one for her. Mahfoud Bennoune, her father, was an outspoken professor at the University of Algiers who faced death threats during the 1990s, but continued speaking out against fundamentalism and terrorism. In writing this book, Karima set out to meet people who are today doing what her father did back then, to try to garner for them greater international support than Algerian democrats received during the 1990s.

She graduated from a joint program in law and Middle Eastern and North African studies at the University of Michigan, earning a J.D. cum laude from the law school and an M.A. from the Rackham Graduate School, as well as a Graduate Certificate in Women’s Studies.

In 1995, she served as a Center for Women’s Global Leadership delegate to the NGO Forum at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing where she provided legal advice to the Tribunal for Global Accountability for Violations of Women’s Human Rights. From 1995 until 1999 she was based in London as a legal adviser at Amnesty International.

She came to UC Davis from Rutgers School of Law – Newark where she was Professor of Law and Arthur L. Dickson Scholar, and taught international law and human rights for ten years. In 2011, she was the recipient of the Chancellor’s Distinguished Research Award at Rutgers University–Newark. Professor Bennoune has also been a visiting scholar and visiting professor at the University of Michigan Law School where she won the L. Hart Wright Award for Excellence in teaching.

Her publications have appeared in many leading academic journals, including the American Journal of International Law, the Berkeley Journal of International Law, the Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, the European Journal of International Law, and the Michigan Journal of International Law. They have been widely cited, including on Slate, in the Nation magazine, the Dallas Morning News, and the Christian Science Monitor, as well as by the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women and the UN Special Rapporteur on protecting human rights while countering terrorism. Her article, “Terror/Torture,” was designated one of the top 10 global security law review articles of 2008 by Oxford University Press.

She has lectured around the world, including at the Harvard Law School, NYU School of Law, UC-Berkeley School of Law, the University of Chicago Law School, the University of Virginia School of Law, the Yale Law School, UCLA Law School,  the Loyola University Marymount Center for Religion and Culture, the International Peace Institute, the International Humanitarian Law Dialogs,  Aloud: Library Foundation of Los Angeles, the Southern Festival of Books, and the Texas Book Festival in the U.S., as well as for the UN Department of Political Affairs, the University of London, the London School of Economics, the University of Oslo, the Shia Ismaili Council for Edmonton and the Edmonton Council of Muslim Communities, the University of Alberta, the European Foundation for Democracy, the National Conference of Tunisian Intellectuals against Terrorism, the Fondation Chokri Belaid, the 19th Salon International du livre d’Alger,  the El Khabar Forum, the Feminist Leadership Institute in Senegal, CODESRIA (The Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa), at TEDxExeter, the Sydney Writer’s Festival, the Australian National University and the Second Istanbul Conference on Democracy and Global Security.

In 2015, Bennoune taught in the summer program in international human rights law at Oxford University, organized jointly by Oxford’s Human Rights Program and the George Washington University School of Law.

She has been invited to lecture about Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here in Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Egypt, France, Italy, Kenya, Poland, Tunisia, Turkey, Senegal, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom, as well as around the United States by Muslims for Progressive Values, the Women’s Learning Partnership and the Levantine Cultural Center (The Markaz), the World Affairs Councils of Austin, Houston, Maine, New Hampshire and Sacramento, the University of Georgia, the University of Michigan and at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. Making frequent media appearances, Bennoune has been a guest on CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360, as well as on MSNBC, Fox Business News, National Public Radio, Pacifica Radio, Sirius Radio, the Australian Broadcasting Service, BBC Radio 4, CBC-Radio, HuffPost Live, and the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour, and has been interviewed by U.S. News and World Report, the Christian Science Monitor, NBC.com, the International Herald Tribune, the Edmonton Journal, Deutsche Welle, and the Guardian..

In 2007, Professor Bennoune became the first Arab-American to win the Derrick Bell Award from the Association of American Law Schools Section on Minority Groups. She has served as a member of the Executive Council of the American Society of International Law and on the board of directors of Amnesty International USA. Currently, she sits on the Board of the Network of Women Living Under Muslim Laws and on the Scholar Advisory Board of Muslims for Progressive Values.

Karima Bennoune has also been a consultant on human rights issues for the International Council on Human Rights Policy, the Soros Foundation, the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, and for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Her human rights field missions have included Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bosnia, Fiji, Lebanon, Pakistan, South Korea, southern Thailand, and Tunisia. In 2009-2010 she was one of a group of international experts assembled by Leiden University, under the auspices of the Dutch Foreign Ministry, to develop a new set of policy recommendations on counter-terrorism and international law. In October 2011, she volunteered as an election observer during the Tunisian constituent assembly elections with Gender Concerns International.  In 2015, she served as an expert at the African regional summit on countering violent extremism, held in Nairobi.

5053,"&gt; Yup, this is why prostitution is basically legalised rape and johns are pieces of shit that I hate with passion.

This is like saying that _any_ job is ""legalized slavery"".

Yeah, it turns out that if you work and are under contract you can't refuse to do your job. It's not rape because you signed a contract that you would and you get _paid_ for it; you gave consent the moment you signed up for the job which no one forced you to.

- If you force someone to have sex against their will by threat of force that's rape; if they voluntarily enter a contract that says they are available to do so and get paid; that's a job.

- If you force someone to move furniture against their will by threat of orce that's slavery; if they voluntarily enter a contract that says they are available to do so and get paid; that's a job.

5062,"&gt;Which isn't the case yet. Judging by the current state of the world, with a tiny minority actually living well (1 billion people actually live reasonably well, the majority is dirt poor), let me be quite sceptical about your claim.

What you call ""dirt poor"" is relative. People who have enough food and clean water would be called lucky just 200 years ago, even in Europe. But I partially agree, three billion could live comfortably on what one billion is wasting today. However, that is a distribution problem, not a problem of limited resources.

&gt;Again mere claims from a random redditor

Weren't your claims also claims of a random editor?

&gt;resources are limited, unless we decisively improve our aerospace engineering and master some way to exploit resources from space we are still stuck with this problem. But as for now it's only sci-fi, now get back to the real world.

They are limited, but not for what is needed for 7 or 10 billion. With practically unlimited energy (nuclear, solar), with today's space technologies (sufficient to tow in asteroids with minerals, or reduce insolation and thereby control climate change), with untapped ocean resources, the planet could easily support more people.

Saskaņa also had a cooperation agreement with United Russia, but recently cancelled it. The party's biggest problem is that almost all Russians vote for them but that's not enough - their only chance of governing are to attract Latvian voters. Since the last election, Saskaņa has been toning down its pro-Russia attitudes somewhat, cancelling that cooperation agreement, saying that Crimea was annexed, and their top candidate recently even said the Soviet Union occupied Latvia.

It might have actually backfired for them as Saskaņa looks to have a worse result than in the previous election.",Latvia | Sweden,/r/europe/comments/9lnu1u/latvian_parliamentary_election_thread/e7aspz6/,CreepyOctopus,1538865894

On the other hand Polans is a homogenous country as of now, with few if any cultural differences you can see in everyday life. Sure, minorities exist, from foreign exchange students to ethnic bars and restaurants, but Poland just feels like Poland wherever you go (or well like the Western European countries a few years or decades back depending on country).

 Was it the fact that we spend a good amount of money on public education in countries where the ruling regimes in said nations prioritizes spending what funds they have on warfare and private jets? 

By the way, that money we spend comes from taxes we pay from the work we do. It's not fun time fantasy money.


Is it condescending of us to do all this for over fifty years and expect nothing back except a slightly better world some day?

5141,"WW1 was only one example. There are a lot of others examples (and not only about war reparations). Agreements of any kind between states don't have these kind of time limitations that you're implying. Otherwise countries would just stop make agreements because the next generation wouldn't feel obliged to honour them. And the reason that the same approach was not taken after WW2 was because of the cold war not because they didn't want to hurt the tender feelings of the germans. 

&gt; After some time, it is unfair to ask them to pay up for crimes of their ancestors. 

No offence but what happened to greece and the greek people during the ww2 was unfair. There's nothing unfair about a country going to court to solve a legal matter. There's nothing unfair about a country going to court so it can be compensated for something like this: 

&gt;As a result of the [Nazi German occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_occupation_of_Greece), much of Greece was subjected to enormous destruction of its industry (80% of which was destroyed), infrastructure (28% destroyed), ports, roads, railways and bridges (90%), forests and other natural resources (25%)[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_reparations#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_reparations#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_reparations#cite_note-3) and loss of civilian life [(7.02–11.17% of its citizens)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_reparations#cite_note-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_reparations#cite_note-5) The occupying Nazi regime forced Greece to pay the cost of the Nazi occupation in the country and requisite raw materials and food for the occupation forces, creating the conditions for the [Great Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Greece)). Furthermore, in 1942, the Greek Central Bank was forced by the occupying Nazi regime to loan 476 million [Reichsmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichsmarks) at 0% interest to Nazi Germany.  
&gt;  
&gt;After the war, in 1960, Greece accepted 115 million Marks from West Germany as compensation for Nazi crimes. Nevertheless, past Greek governments have insisted that this was only a down-payment, not complete reparations.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_reparations#cite_note-6) In 1990, immediately prior to German reunification, West Germany and East Germany signed the [Two Plus Four Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Final_Settlement_with_Respect_to_Germany) with the former [Allied countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) of the United States, United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, but not Greece. Since that time, Germany has unilaterally insisted that all matters concerning World War II, including further reparations to Greece, are closed. On 8 February 2015, the Greek Prime Minister, [Alexis Tsipras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Tsipras) demanded that Germany pay the complete reparations to Greece.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_reparations#cite_note-7) On 6 April 2015, Greece evaluated the war reparations to be the equivalent of 279 billion euros. Germany replied that the reparations issue was resolved in 1990.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_reparations#cite_note-8)

&gt; Why pay for sex if you can get it for free?

Because that way you can get a legal rapist experience. A lot of johns like the fact that the prostitute feels uncomfortable. That is what turns them on. You can't get that from a willing partner.

Also johns like to do shit that they saw in porn - stuff that willing partners would never want to do. 

This ""industry"" is rotten to the core.

And then there are also brothels that exploit prostitutes and force them to have sex with johns that they dislike - yeah they have ""choice"" in theory, but in practice - a room in a brothel costs a lot - turn away enough of johns and you will lose money and make the brothel's owner angry.

Also most prostitutes in countries like Germany and the Netherlands are foreigners from poor countries like Romania, because local women don't want to do it - so traffickers get them to Germany legally or illegally and then exploit the fuck out of them.

5250,"A pretty reasonable position on Berlins' behalf, to be fair. I imagine Greece would be none too happy if people started demanding reparations for the times of Alexander the Great. They'd (rightly) probably laugh and tell the relevant parties to fuck right off.

Your initial implication was ""Greece didn't get any reparations!"". I proved that to be an outright lie, because it was, and now you're changing your tune to ""we did get reparations, but not enough"".

If that's the same way your government went about negotiations I can absolutely understand how the situation ended up as it did. It seems to me that Greece acts to Germany in a very similar manner to how Argentina acts in regard to the United Kingdom. Whenever there are failings in internal governance, summon up a foreign bogeyman to project your problems onto. Greece's present economic state lies entirely in your own damn hands. The wall didn't fall till 1989, and yet Germany managed to thrive after being split in half between diametrically opposed superpowers for decades after the war. 

Realistically, here's how I see it: there are fuck all to no people left who were personally affected by WW2, and fewer every day. Why should Germans who had nothing to do with the war, were born after the war ended and have never supported any sort of foreign aggression in any way be held responsible for the crimes of their (at this point) great grandfathers? If you're willing to say that guilt can cross generations, then EVERY nation is culpable. Given the extent of what was once Greek expansionism, Greece would be more culpable than some, less so than many. Be careful what you wish for.

I'm sure you want to shoot back with ""we're not holding modern germans accountable, we're holding the german government accountable"" but this does not work. Firstly, it's German taxpayers who actually foot the bill (you know, the ones who never had anything even remotely to do with the war) and secondly, it's not even the same government or nation that started the war in the first place.

5264,"It is not insulting and vile, it's economics. You can argue, which is quite justified I might add, that in a welfare state there are periods where one recieves, such as childhood and retirement, and a working period during which one gives. Welfare isn't a handout, it's a system and pensioners deserve their pensions. 

*However* we must also note that at any given moment pensioners are an expense. Not only do they cost money, they also aren't working, costing potential money. Working age adults are the ones contributing to the economy at any given time.

Refugees costing less would just mean they cost less money (per taxpayer) than a retiree.

Essentially, you need to keep tax income and expenses balanced somehow. Most often countries actually fail at this, the entire global economy is a system of international debt. Regardless, no country wants more and more debt, look at Greece for a splendid example of borrowing above your weight.

In the next few decades welfare will likely have to change, probably decrease, in a large part due to the population decline of Europe. It's not just pensioners that suffer in such a case, but anyone who is primarily a tax reciever, and really on some level everyone is at least somewhat of a tax recieves. Pensioners are just one expensive group, but really their healthcare is what's most expensive. Curing aging would actually cut costs significantly, since people would be healthier in their old age, so it's not as of there's only one long term solution. In the mean time, we have to make ends meet somehow, and that means higher taxes and cuts in healthcare, education and unemployment benefits, for example.

There's nothing vile about facing realities. Those realities can be uncomfortable, even for me, and I certainly don't want to cut pensions don't get me wrong, but we desparately need to make this system sustainable again, one way or another, preferably in the fairest and least painful way possible.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9ltwmq/dont_complain_youre_lucky_macron_tells_french/e7amdbf/,GalaXion24,1538859909

Then they divert traffic from a main street crossed literally by tens of thousands of drivers every day, diverting that traffic to smaller lateral streets, increasing transit times and increasing pollution.

Then they did NOT begin the construction of the previously planned disuasory parking lots which outsiders could use to avoid taking private vehicles inside the city center but allowing their commuting times to be less than three fucking hours.

Yeah, the problem is that your definition of ""abuse"" is literally ""no one gets hurt and everyone involved does it out of their own volition""

That is why people call you a ""moralist"" because you think that situations without a victim can be ""amoral"" and ""abusive"" because you don't think things are wrong because people get hurt but simply because you want to invade other people's lives and decide for them how they have sex.

When the modern jet planes rendered the hydroplanes obsolete, the place became an industrial park of containers, polluting industries and also scrapyards, seeing a growing degradation over the decades.

So, in 1992 this area was chosen to host Expo '98, the 1998 world exposition, with the theme ""The Oceans, a Heritage for the Future"", chosen to commemorate 500 years of Portuguese discoveries.

As a result, the Expo '98 was fully built from scratch. Every building was pre-sold for after-Expo repurposing thus ensuring that, after the Expo closed, the site would not be left semi-abandoned, as had happened with previous expos. As a reminder of the site's industrial past, only the refinery tower was kept and repurposed.

You've expressed your disbelief regarding the accepted etymology of 'aujourd'hui' and called me being wrong on that. In response, I've brought objective proof to the discussion (that should've caused you to reevaluate your opinion or at least present it better).

This - two or more people presenting conflicting views on a subject and trying to prove or disprove those - is called a debate. The verb 'to argue' can be used to express the activity of debating something.

This could be the reason why you feel I've been arguing. On this we agree: I'd like to think I argued.

I think the logic of 'aujourd'hui' and as you've told, 'Doamne Dumnezeule' is quite similar: an ancient expression's original structure (or its meaning) is lost and consequently repeated. I find this interesting, because the two are clearly not interconnected in any way.

This is completely wrong. Statistics is weird, and people generally do not understand it. Judging whether something is improbable or not should only be done with full knowledge of the situation.

As a hypothetical, it could be that growers in Serbia know that Russians don't have as vigorous a vetting process as the EU, and therefore are happy to use different methods to produce goods destined for Russia that they would not use for goods destined for the EU. In which case, it is probable that any problems with the food imported into Russia would not be seen in food imported into the EU.

After that whole thing (2012 or so) she pretty much disappeared from any public life, as it brought her so much shame —even more taking into account the ""morally above everything else"" diva character she was known for.

These parties, when presenting as overall ideology, also often get into trouble as when the actual work besides campaign starts it turns out they're full of people who all agreed that shit sucks currently, but don't have a unified vision of how to navigate in the land of compromises as a small party with very limited power and pick their one thing as they're usually full of ""woke"" individuals.

5767,"To understand KPV you need to know a bit about its creator, Artuss Kaimiņš. He is a former renowned actor, later radio show/video blog host. In Latvia's relatively primitive political media-space, he was essentially the first major public figure to capitalize on new spaces like Youtube. In his show, he was deliberately controversial, contrarian and anti-establishment. That gained him more attention, notoriety, and fame, especially among new generations.

In 2014 elections he ran as a member of Latvian Association of Regions. Despite being the **last** person on LAR's list he earned most individual votes in his party and in the country as a whole. That's insane and should tell you how much sway his personality has. After the election, there were some disagreements inside LAR and he left the party in 2015, becoming an independent politician in the Parliament. As, essentially, a one-man party he used opposition/anti-establishment tactics. For example, cornering his opponents, filming them and demanding to know why they voted a certain way was one such tactic. This, obviously, made him even more popular so it was a no-brainer he'd create his own party in the future. And in 2016-2017 he did just that.

The very name of the party Kam Pieder Valsts? (Who owns the State?) reflects his anti-establishment, populist persona, as does the party's program. They want to outlaw the rule of the coalition, reduce the number of parliamentary's, reform the judicial system. Nationalization of kindergartens, schools, and universities,  is one of their best ideas in my opinion. However, their aim of reforming taxation troubles me as it's all very vague and seems to favor business and the wealthy instead of the people. Kaimiņš also was recently accused of and arrested for tax-fraud, couple that with taxation reform and judicial reform ideas and yikes...

5797,"&gt; Muhammad was a man of his time

Then explain why:

* Jesus did not start wars, Gautama did not start wars, Muhammad did.

* Jesus did not own slaves, Gautama did not own slaves, Muhammad did.

* Jesus did not rape, Gautama did not rape, Muhammad did.

* Jesus was not a pedophile, Gautama was not a pedophile, Muhammad married a six-year old girl and fucked her when she was 9.

* Jesus did not kill homosexuals, Gautama did not kill homosexuals, Muhammad did.

* Jesus did not kill apostates, Gautama did not kill apostates, Muhammad did.

* Jesus did not kill people for writing satyrical poems, Gautama did not kill people for writing satyrical poems, Muhammad did.

So Jesus and Gautama were not ""men of their times"", in your view? What were they, aliens or time travellers?

And in any case, ""man of his time"" does not make it ok *if a religion is founded around the idea that Muhammad's life and teaching are divine in nature and that everyone should do what Muhammad did and said one should do*. It is not a problem that Genghis Khan was a less than ideal human being by today's standards, until some cunt decides to start a religion based on the idea of doing whatever bullshit Genghis Khan did in his time.


&gt; nothing that couldnt be said about Abraham, Solomon or other Christian/Jewish/Islamic prophets

When you say ""Christian/Jewish/Islamic prophets"" without making any distinction, you show that you really do not understand the roles that, say, Abraham has in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

&gt; Why do you put conditions to discuss what I talk about

I already told you why. Because you keep denying universally accepted facts about Muhammad's life and teachings - I don't know if out of ignorance or in an attempt to placate some kind of cognitive dissonance between cultural relativism and actual reality. 

If you agreed that Muhammad raped, tortured, started wars, fucked children, owned slaves, and had gays, apostates, and adulterers killed, that could perhaps start the discussion. But if you deny basic facts, then it is really useless.

In addition, you seem to lack a basic understanding of the differences between Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. So discussing with you is not particularly interesting for me, since I feel that I do not have much to learn from you.

5924,"I don't think this is quite right. If anything, the US would be able to ignore the rest of the world more than the other way around. The only way a lot of these countries have become successful is through properly utilizing the neoliberal framework the US built during the Cold War, where a global US presence guarantees international free trade. Without that, a lot of countries are dead in the water. From the way things appear now, the US looks to be seeking to withdraw from the rest of the world.

This is part of why China is rushing to build a navy - they want to secure their trade routes. Without free trade, what is modern China? Their One-Belt One-Road initiative might be a card up their sleeve, but that requires China to be economically dominant over these next few decades, and they've already begun to reach their plateau. What happens in twenty years when a few hundred million Chinese are caring for almost a billion elderly?

What is the German economy without free trade? Their economy is mostly export-focused, but they don't have the navy to secure these exports. Part of why they're so successful is because of how they've used the EU as an economic vehicle - but what if in a couple decades, there is no more relevant EU?

The US would mostly be fine. They can secure their trade with partners in Europe and the Pacific, and they can defend the USMCA. Japan would be fine, and Britain wouldn't be in a bad position either. We'd mostly see a return to the early 1900s, where everyone's out for themselves.

And regarding India, they've been the up-and-coming power for centuries now. The fact is that there is too little infrastructure and too much internal fragmentation to build a superpower. Even when it comes to China, the world's economic superpower, only their major cities and coasts are really developed. India is in no position to undergo such rapid development with the next half-century. Progress will be made, of course, but the world isn't going to become and Indian world anytime soon.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9lmvdw/the_united_states_is_likely_to_succeed_in/e79fws2/,RealRagingLlama,1538808967

Atbalstīsim audžuģimenes, palielinot finansiālu atbalstu, apmācības iespējas, specializāciju. Pieaugušajiem valsts sociālās aprūpes centru iemītniekiem nodrošināsim kopienās balstītas pusceļa mājas.

Which roughly translates to:

Will continue long-term deinstitutionalization plan of social care centers and foster homes. Will support foster families by increasing benefits, education possibilities, specialization possibilities. Grown-ups who went through orphanages will continue to recieve social housing. 

So I guess their plan is to minimize the number of orphanages instead putting more focus on foster families.
