9,"70% of all Germans (and still 60% of Saxons) say they would never even consider voting for them. For other parties this number is typically around 25%. The AfD is widely hated. But they have a certain base that will vote for them.

They are actually not rising in polls anymore. They have been around 15% federally and around 25% in their strongest states for a while already. But that doesn't make a good headline. It's still scary as shit to me that there are this many people who would vote for a party filled with Nazis.

As for fake news, absolutely. Their followers are a social media bubble that is almost completely separate from the rest of the country.

15,"&gt;You replied directly to a response to that graph with stats about EU GDP based on PPP. Whether or not it was you that posted the graph is irrelevent because you were trying to refute my rebuttal to the graph.

No, it's pretty relevant who did and said what. I would never have posted that graph, and honestly didn't really look at it, but I also can't agree with you that the EU and the US are on similar trajectories. We're in much deeper shit. But I should have posted nominal stats for the EU alongside the ones for the US, I accept that.

But you were wrong. The trend line would not be the same if you added the US, even if you used PPP. It would look a lot better, by your own figures. You're being awfully... *pedantic*, fussing over which figures should be used when they both show you're wrong - just to different degrees.

17,"&gt;Please don't misrepresent my words. I said that pro-Brexit people who believe they can't elect their own government are morons, not that all pro-Brexit ones in general are

This thread hinged on LegalBuzzBee insisting that Scottish Yes voters ""just want to be able to elect our own government""; i.e. do not currently. And yet they *do* elect their government, to both Westminster and Holyrood.

So presumably you must think these Scotnats are all morons, yes?

&gt;As far as Scotland goes, they can elect their government but it operates on the opposite principle of the EU. In Europe, the EU is awarded competence in a few areas that it can propose and pass legislation in.

Yes, ""a few areas"", like international trade, borders, and in the case of the Eurozone, fiscal and monetary policy. Such a minor thing.

&gt;This doesn't preclude the individual countries from still setting their own policy as long as it meets the common EU standards

Except bilateral trade agreements, intra-European immigration limits, and, for 19 poor saps, their entire economies.

&gt;Everything else, it has to follow the UK's laws in which the Scots have relatively little to say.

55,"Well, what I mean by national sovereignty here is that the Britain is an extremely old collection of civilizations with a long history and a clear national boundary in regards to general culture and philosophy, as differentiable from say, Germany or Spain. I think now that the EU has been stressed with a few trials, most notably mass immigration, a very clear delineation of cultural incompatibilities is surfacing between nations which have otherwise been forced into the same boat with one another.

My impression, as an American, is that many of the British feel as though there has been a steady erosion of values associated with English liberalism, ideas such as relatively free speech, anti-authoritarian laissez-faire economic philosophy, and the right to self-determination. Freedom of speech, for example, is very much *not* a German value. Anti-authoritarianism is very much *not* a German value. And yet, Labour and Conservative parties in the UK are both increasingly looking more like European/German factions than anything that appears remotely British.

So what I mean is that there is a set of cultural behaviors and values that, given recent frictions, are only now forced to reveal themselves as being somewhat rooted within the very old histories of the individual nation states in Europe which produced them. This, being paired with the relatively undemocratic nature of the EU, has made it apparent enough to enough of the British, that they feel as though the British values are simply overpowered by forceful association with a greater collective that espouses entirely different priorities.",,/r/europe/comments/cvldt4/boris_johnson_vs_eu/ey7dfxc/,ralusek,1566879200

None of the 28 member states are either directly or indirectly governed by some sort of scary secret branch of the Union, their parliaments free to legislate as they feel necessary.

The European Parliament might not currently possess the power to autonomously propose laws but it is de facto very close. And the parliamentarians are actually chosen by the citizens of the member states in a way the states individually decided.

The European Commission is indeed not formed in the most democratic way possible. But it absolutely gets the commissioners in a way indirectly voters are involved, just by being nominated by the national governments. All throughout the process the Commission is held accountable to the European Parliament.

Then we have the European Council that's basically institutionalised getting together by the ministers. Those were also (indirectly) elected by citizens and such.

168,"The thing is, it didn't back then.

If you kept your good old 20 Mark and 5 Mark gold coins from before WWI, or the silver ones for smaller denominations, aka ""real cash"", you were fine. Only if you went with the latest new payment method that was paper money or a bank account, you lost everything.

Mark, Rentenmark, Reichsmark, D-Mark all had at least some silver coins. I think the last silver 5 DM coins were issued in the 70s; my parents definitely still used them. But even after that, til the introduction of the Euro, 5 DM existed in coin and banknote form, but nobody used the banknotes in everyday life, it was all coins.

So even with no silver left in them, coins were still the preferred kind of cash, probably because in the past coins had been the safe kind of money.

I still remember my surprise at the lack of a 5 ‚Ç¨ coin when the Euro was introduced, and it felt like they were giving us one of those ""shitty cheap currencies"" where even everyday transactions are in banknotes.

In that way of thinking (or rather ""feeling"", cause it is more of a feeling than a thought), banknotes aren't as good as coins, but at least they are real, you can touch them, and your ability to pay with them doesn't depend on electricity or on your trust in the clerk at your bank not to flip a switch and lock your account.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/cvmlho/germany_in_uproar_as_negative_rates_threaten/ey75om7/,muehsam,1566872529

268,"Yes, they dont go around wearing their oligarc title around, but a few powerfull figures inside the EU parlament control the economy for benefit of  their favorite companies. Its a figurative way of speaking. 

If you want to speak numbers On the trading aspect... 2018 GDP of europe 18m; US: 20m. So no, not the biggest. Second biggest. And guess who is in the top 4 countries that  contributes the most. Bet China is gonna take that second spot after brexit. 

What I mean is that there should not be a parliament in brussels. No head of the EU. Only sovereign states dealing with each other in accordance, offering the same agreements on trade, war, peace, and mutual collaboration. No need for a bunch of people on a payroll deciding what is best for the common of the people. It has been proven to not represent the will of the europeans, and instead favor the will of those sitting  in brussels.  (here comes yours anwers: oH bUt ThEy ArE ElEctEd bY thE CoUntrY). Like that law about the internet no one wanted, yet it still passed. Why? Lobbies. And sadly, as the EU parliament, they are not going anywhere. 

So, no need for them to take an uber. They should take the bus back home. 

Yes, I call OPs here slaves. Ideological slaves, that refuse to accept that corruption has its own chair in that Parliament and prefer to accept the devil that they know than face the idea of change for the better. Maybe, there is  an agenda in reddit, we saw the desinformation campaing of the russian in the US, most likely happens in this forums aswell. 

Slaves, because every post I see is a NPC. Repeating brexit bad, while not trying to understand what lead to this. 


Hope some europeans see the EU for what it is and get a grip of their own countries and believes instead of just letting everything get decided in Brussels... What an easy day for the sheep in the field, isn't it?

At least people in Hong Kong have the balls to fight for what they believe, same as a part of the brits. Same as the yellow vests in France. 

You can discuss all you want here. And we can have different opinions. But  is that all you have? Can you tell apart the facts from your opinions? Or do you ignore some facts and accept the opinions you like? And I mean really....is everything you are picking up in the news true? Or misleading your thought into compliance and acceptance of a somewhat fabricated perpective of reality. Why do you hate Trump so much? Have you heard Boris speak and his ideas?

There is less foodborne illness in the US than in the EU.

Illnesses from e-coli are almost identical in both the US and the EU.

The U.S. rate for Campylobacteriosis is 14.3 per 100,000 vs. 55.5 for the EU. 

The Salmonellosis rate for the U.S. was 16.42 per 100,000 and 22.2 for the EU. 

The Listeriosis rate is 0.25 per 100,000 for the U.S. and 0.41 per 100,000 for the EU.

Note that chlorine is a good way to kill both campylobacter and salmonella. I'm just saying...

343,"&gt;Countries with higher levels of immigration also are generally more prosperous than ones where there is less immigration.

I don't know, Japan, South Korea or to name a European example, Finland all seem to be prosperous countries with very high living standard even though they have very few immigrants and are almost completely ethnically homogenous. This idea that for a country to be successful it needs to embrace mass migration is just a neoliberal talking point.

&gt;It is also not beneficial for large companies to have a stagnant market as it reduces their capacity to growth and thus their ability to make more money.

Not sure what you mean exactly by ""stagnant market"". Germany has the second largest immigrant population in the world and its still stagnating economically.

402,"&gt;Buybacks must happen in my opinion, because the property should of never been sold in the first place. Public housing is a good method of retaining wealth within the city for future improvements to many underfunded sectors in Berlin. Also it secures homes for the elderly, sick, disabled and poor which is far more important then someones profit margin.

It was a mistake of selling the property but rebuying it does not convey many benefits. The German social housing system is fundamentally broken with social housing being timed (I think 20 years before becoming regular housing). Building new housing would be a far better investment. Yes, in the short-term those residents would not benefits from the construction, but a higher amount of flats would outweigh the slim benefits of buying overpriced property back from companies.

&gt;As a resident of Tempelhof I strongly disagree with you on regards to the Feld, it was voted by referendum (63% agreed) that the Feld should remain intact as a public park for many reasons.

Like I care about democracy or those in the planning department should care. A small region can be preserved but this huge area should be put to use for the city. Caring about some stupid boar is counterproductive.

&gt;Gleisdreieck is a great example of a urban housing project built on brown field land.

That would probably help but is nothing compared to Tempelhof. If that huge brown field helps air quality much I'll eat my hat.

You have to realise that great thing rarely come without sacrifice. The great avenues of Paris weren't built with the people's consent and instead simply all building in the way of these massive infrastructure projects were bulldozed. But now look at the Parisians who forgot the sacrifice and instead laud their straight roads. Tempelhof is such an example. At least half of the park can be repurposed without any decline in quality. The airport itself sits unused as far as I know so repurposing it would not be an issue. Maybe keep the landing strips and make the area car-free. As long as high density housing is built it will be bought.",√ñsterreich,/r/europe/comments/cvl0sd/berlin_could_cap_housing_rents_at_under_8_per/ey6359f/,RedKrypton,1566846342

424,"&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;**Beyond a DNA on steroids?**
-

&gt;**Anti-graft efforts are a must for all EU states and Romania has achieved remarkable progress in its fight against this scourge. Nonetheless, it has been a bumpy ride and Romania can become a textbook example of how hard it can be to implement such a strategy at state level. Strengthening institutions, steadily promoting uncompromised magistrates in key positions, fighting back against political pressure on the judiciary and a keen eye for always respecting human rights are vital elements for the health of this process.**

&gt;In 2007, Romania became an official member of the EU, and this brought along a boom of European investment meant to help the country catch up on fellow member-states in terms of economic development. Compared to the Western countries which were fortunate enough not to face the blows of totalitarian regimes, Romania‚Äôs economic transformation, as aided by the EU, looks spectacular.

&gt;A nation which in 1989 looked bleak and impoverished, eaten from the inside by organised corruption, and which went through an unhealthily long transition period, Romania swiftly gained the status of a Westernised country in its new quality as an EU member. Brussels, however, was not looking to continue to fund the country unconditionally, but took upon itself the task of implementing a long-term fight against high-level corruption. In return, Romania vowed to show Brussels that it intended to truly reform itself and that it would subject itself to the rule of law as a governing principle.

&gt;Twelve years on, the fight against corruption remains the country‚Äôs main debate topic, both internally and internationally. Aided by a Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) meant to track the progress of justice independence and the fight against graft, officials in Brussels used the annual report results as a filter in their interactions with Romania‚Äôs political class. When the CVM recorded a win in the anti-graft fight, Brussels leaders cheered on, while the attempts of Romanian political figures to dampen the judiciary‚Äôs anti-corruption zeal were swiftly and strongly sanctioned.

&gt;The first few years ‚Äî starting with the mandate of Daniel Morar, the first reformist head of the DNA, and continuing with Laura Codru»õa Kovesi‚Äôs mandates ‚Äî brought remarkable progress, with news of high-level Romanian officials receiving stiff prison sentences making the rounds of international media. However, something changed in late 2016, when the PSD-ALDE coalition won the country‚Äôs parliamentary elections, a step backwards that can be described as a slip in the direction of authoritarianism.

&gt;The above summary is a simplified narrative of Romania‚Äôs anti-corruption saga, one that most EU officials adhere to as a means of explaining the whole deal to the Union‚Äôs citizens in an easily understandable manner. A more nuanced look at Romania‚Äôs fight against corruption and testimonies by stakeholders will, however, reveal this narrative as extremely reductionist, if not outright harmful.

&gt;In the implementation process, the anti-corruption fight in Romania did not follow a linear trajectory and cannot be wrapped up as a binary endeavour, a ‚Äògood versus evil‚Äô story of justice-bearing heroes against venal villains.

&gt;Like any far-reaching national policy, once rolled out it could bring both breakthroughs and (correctible) mistakes. What follows is the author‚Äôs take on the whole process‚Äô pros and cons.

&gt;&gt;&gt;**Anti-corruption and pressure from Brussels**

&gt;The CVM‚Äôs yearly reports, through which Brussels officials were able to offer informed opinions about progress in reforming the judiciary, had both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, Brussels managed to mobilise a sustained fight against corruption, and helped Romania to confront its issues instead of burying them. On the other hand, it created a form of pressure which also led to some collateral damage: some prosecutors fell into the trap of superficiality and haste when putting together several cases with huge political stakes.

&gt;In other words, when you work against the clock on a case to boost the figures of a CVM report, the odds are that you will make a slip here and there. Haste makes waste, including when you are defending a case.

&gt;*Brussels requested judiciary reforms which were meant to eventually demolish organised corruption, although it never imposed quantitative goals. However, the National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) headed by K√∂vesi also aimed to impress Brussels through the sheer number of cases that included high-profile Romanian officials.             
&gt;*DNA‚Äôs bottom line, which included impressive numbers of dignitaries investigated by the institution, always made a point of.*

&gt;The resulting sloppiness could explain the acquittal of several high-profile politicians. The list of infamous cases includes names such as Romania‚Äôs former Prime Minister Victor Ponta (acquitted in a lower court); senate leader CƒÉlin Popescu TƒÉriceanu (ultimately acquitted of perjury); Ludovic Orban, the leader of the National Liberal Party (PNL) and a top opposition player (acquitted after being accused of influence-peddling for undue benefits); and Tiberiu Ni»õu, the chief prosecutor, who quit the Prosecutor-General‚Äôs Office after being investigated for complicity to abuse his office (case dismissed).

&gt;Moreover, a liberal politician and a former president of Romania‚Äôs Financial Supervisory Authority, Dan Radu Ru»ôanu, was arrested during a criminal investigation, but was later acquitted in court. After that, Ru»ôanu sued the state for damages for the period he spent under arrest (‚Ç¨1.4 million), most of which will go on his lawyers‚Äô fees and the salary he should have gotten as Financial Supervisory Authority/ASF president during his five-year mandate, of which he only got to serve four months.

&gt;K√∂vesi‚Äôs institutional defence regarding weak cases emphasised that the DNA‚Äôs acquittal ratio was always under 10 percent, below the European average. This defence is flawed. When publicly announcing the criminal prosecution of a politician in power with high-level public leverage, one has a duty to build a very strong case, with high chances of ending in a court sentence. Failing to do so risks destabilising the directorate and drawing the label of politically motivated cases meant to push unwanted figures to the sidelines of public life.

&gt;This type of overreaction is far from unusual in Romania‚Äôs political class. The same pattern can be observed, for example, in the well-known case of US special counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs investigation into Russian meddling into the 2016 presidential elections and potential collusion with the GOP campaign, which was constantly attacked and discredited by President Donald Trump and labelled as a partisan ‚Äúwitch hunt.‚Äù

&gt;In order to avoid the damage which similar accusations could cause, prosecutors handling such cases must work under maximum accountability.

&gt;An internal audit on prosecutors whose cases were invalidated in court came a few years late, in the spring of 2019, under the mandate of acting chief-prosecutor CƒÉlin Nistor, as Nistor himself mentioned during several TV appearances. The result? Several DNA prosecutors were posted to other offices across the country, offices that lack the competence of investigating high-level corruption

&gt;The question raised within the institution was: to what extent do prosecutors bear the blame for cases invalidated in court? When should a prosecutor who built a weak case be held accountable, and when not?

&gt;To mitigate similar situations going forward, the selection of prosecutors for Romania‚Äôs most powerful public prosecutor‚Äôs office must set the bar as high as possible.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/cvsiwr/beyond_a_dna_on_steroids/ey63gxi/,Ebadd,1566846558

438,"&gt; What I meant spacifically is that the existence of EU as a post national institution has served to keep in check its members and improve the standards for everyone.

Yes, and I agree with that sentiment. The EU has done an amazing job of uniting a continent that has historically waged war against itself for ages, and opened it up to a tonne of amazing opportunities and possibilities. 
&gt; 
&gt; It has had a huge positive impact in states like my own (Spain) where its mere existence and the possibility of joining has worked as an engine powering us towards the acceptance and respect of human rights, democracy and general change in values towards a more tolerant society. Im willing to bet the same can be said of others like Portugal, Greece and to some extent other countries like Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, etc.

Again, nobody is really denying the fact that the EU was instrumental in the development of Europe into what it is today. Indeed, without it certain countries would've been far worse off than they are right now. However, that does not mean that the EU is perfect and should rest on its laurels; there is *always* room to improve the system. The EU, we as Europeans, all have potential to achieve so much more. That won't be the case if the momentum stops and the EU begins to stagnate.

&gt;Also, we have the higest degrees of protection of workers in the whole word, we ofc should always strive to improve things, but I believe that looking at our situation on a global scale we have nothing to complain about.

&gt;A very different case could be made if we discussed how a lot of places outside of EU dont have the same standards and how big enterprises make a profit out of that by opressing workers.

We can never grow complacent if we strive for improvement. Yes, there are countries who have it far worse, but that does not mean that we should be content with what we have right now especially since our current arrangements are far from ideal. Even today, in our modern republics, there are people who barely make ends meet on their petty wages. Thousands who end up homeless on the streets because of the capitalist mechanisms that prey upon those with no means to defend themselves. 

Which brings me to my point: you could spend your entire life working a shitty job for 10 hours a day for 40 years and still not achieve the kind of wealth that some people possess because they were born into it, had good connections, or simply exploited the system before anyone else did. Our society has been conditioned into accepting wealth inequality and the domination of this neo-aristocracy as the natural order of things, but the more people think about why that is the more cracks begin to show. Nationalism is merely a symptom of the rot festering in our society. Nazism wasn't some isolated case that appeared out of nowhere; when you have a tired, hungry, angry populace that's constantly under assault from an elite who only seeks profit, they naturally move towards anything that promises them a release. Hitler did just that, improving living conditions for the average German. Now that the old order of liberalism is making its way back again its only natural that in turn things like nationalism or communism make a resurgence again. 

Not that nationalism is something that isn't undesirable in the first place. The whole article makes the insinuation that nationalism is a bad thing as a whole, but really anything in excess can be harmful. At its core nationalism is the love for one's nation and its people. Indeed, we can expect nationalists to be more active in politics, more likely to engage in socialist policies, etc because of that love. The problem is that it's been co-opted by people to push their own agendas, and that the elite sees it as a threat to the neoliberal order of things.

In fact, if you follow politics closely, you'd see that several of the most prominent brexit leaders have already said that they are open to having a second referendum **after** brexit.",,/r/europe/comments/cvldt4/boris_johnson_vs_eu/ey63zou/,gman2015,1566846900

473,"&gt;&gt;&gt;**Reform and legal idols**

&gt;Another area in which Romania did not score well was the set of recommendations regarding the process of selecting the top prosecutors, including the DNA‚Äôs head prosecutor. These CVMissued recommendations have rarely been followed by Bucharest policymakers. Even the naming of K√∂vesi as chief DNA prosecutor was tainted by political agreements. The 2013 naming of K√∂vesi was possible due to an agreement between then-president Traian BƒÉsescu and Victor Ponta, prime-minister at the time, the latter also serving as Acting-Minister of Justice. K√∂vesi was proposed for the DNA position while Tiberiu Ni»õu, whom the press depicted as a figure close to Ponta, was put forward to fill the general prosecutor spot that K√∂vesi was leaving vacant. BƒÉsescu accepted both moves.

&gt;A judiciary system shows its independence when the most important roles are open to new people. There should be a constant stream of well-performing magistrates entering the key positions. However, in Romania, the general tendency is to rotate the same figures to the point when they seem to be untouchable. This was the case with K√∂vesi, whose aura left the impression that the institution could not perform without her.

&gt;The same thing happened with Daniel Morar, who served as the DNA‚Äôs chief prosecutor in 2005-2012. During his mandate, anti-corruption policies started showing tangible results.

&gt;But the goal should be to secure the position of the institution, and not to idealise its leaders. While the political scene is used to messianic figures, the judiciary would do well without them.

&gt;Another controversy that hit the public sphere, and which was also excessively instrumentalised by political figures indicted for corruption, was the collaboration between the DNA and the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI). With the SRI benefitting from high-quality technology and agents trained in surveillance and telecommunications monitoring, the collaboration between the two institutions brought the DNA a record number of cases.

&gt;The secret cooperation protocols, declassified by SRI in June 2018, showed that the SRI and the prosecution bodies (including the National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA)) formed joint operative teams to investigate crimes related to national security and other serious crimes. But in February 2016, Romania‚Äôs Constitutional Court ruled such collaboration unconstitutional, prompting politicians to get their cases shut down on the basis that the evidence collected with the help of SRI officers had been obtained illegally. Nonetheless, up until the Court‚Äôs decision (and even afterwards), cases built up with the help of the SRI have been validated by many Romanian judges.

&gt;The issue in this case is not the collaboration itself between a prosecutor‚Äôs office and a secret service, but rather the ‚Äôlack of clarity in Romanian legislation. At the moment of writing, a SRI operative can still legally send informative memos to a prosecutor revealing potential criminal offences. However, the number of such briefings has waned due to the recent lack of political will to reinforce this collaboration.

&gt;As a side note, the SRI had its own infamous corruption case, with General Ovidiu Soare, a former head of the Economic Security Department, receiving a suspended sentence after trying to cover up corruption offences without notifying the judicial bodies. The DNA‚Äôs prosecutors accused him of not informing the judicial authorities that certain individuals were allegedly involved in criminal activities.

&gt;With this institutional collaboration effectively out of the picture, the DNA is currently forced to rely heavily on the help of the judicial police.

&gt;This raises a benchmarking issue, as there are no objective analyses that explain what would constitute a natural rhythm for the institution under these new terms.

&gt;*Was the DNA working on steroids during the collaboration with the SRI? Why did the number of cases drop significantly after the collaboration stopped, and why can‚Äôt the directorate pick up the pace?*                   
&gt;*No Romanian stakeholder has yet objectively answered these questions, and the current political climate does not encourage such reformist actions.*

&gt;&gt;&gt;**Unfinished business**

&gt;What‚Äôs more, Romania‚Äôs anti-corruption fight mostly involved criminal cases and the apprehension of alleged criminals, with little to no talk of prevention in public debates. The national anti-corruption strategy (2016-2020) includes a preventative element but, being a rather bland talking point, it could not impose itself in the public arena.

&gt;Criminal case files cannot solve all of society‚Äôs problems, especially since corruption is a deeply rooted issue in Romania. During the 45 years of the Communist regime, poverty made stealing from the state a common practice, indeed often a question of survival. How can one change such a mindset? Is retribution enough?

On top of that, this will of course not work to satisfy the extreme right voters, and then the natural next step is to try the same thing harder and exclude more people. Because you already accepted that *those people* were the problem, implicitly.

This is not going to be solved by simply getting lucky by trying the right policy after which everything will be back to the old. There needs to be a debate about the practical limits of migration, because both extremes are essentially based on principles (closed borders vs. human rights), and those are very ill-suited to compromise. We must have a debat about our actual migration capacity, what the costs are of migration, what our integration capacity is, and on that we can base a capacity for integration and a target number.

810,"&gt;Yes you refused to even entertain the idea, saying that trying to win over far right voters is pandering to racists.

No, I didn't. I only said that I refused to stop condemning racist statements. So unless you think that that is the only possible implementation of winning over far right voters, that still leaves plenty of options to win over voters.

&gt;Tax corporations to free up money. Invest in healthcare and safety, two key areas of trouble for the lower class.
Tax polluting corporations, use that money directly to pay for peoples cost in getting their houses of gas heating, better isolation and solar power, so that the energy change is not being paid for by the working class, which is now leading to a push against it (far right in The Netherlands basically won the election because of higher energy bills).

That's pretty much standard fare in leftwing programs. That's nothing new.

Of course, when rightwing parties like the VVD are in government, they implement measures at the expense of the working class. You really can't blame the left for that, and not not offerring the alternative either.

&gt;Stop taking in immigrants who cross over from Africa

So basically say ""yes sir, right away sir"" and salute to the racist parties. Got it. And you complain about accusations of pandering?

&gt;instead work with the UN to take in families so you don't get mostly young men who are the main cause of trouble in any society, while still helping people in a humane way. Yes, the stream of immigrants has gone down greatly, but it is still dominating the news whenever a ship arrives and winning far right votes.

There is no instead. They'll keep criticizing the development aid budget then, or any money going to refugees at all. It also won't change the feelings of the people, who have accepted that seeing brown faces on the street is a reason to be angry. So as long as that remains the case, they'll stay angry. Changing migration policies will not change that, so you can either work on reducing racism, or start encouraging emigration by targeting specific ethnicities. The latter is obviously a capitulation to the idea that brown people are the problem, so that's really not acceptable to any democrat worth the name.

&gt;It goes hand it hand. For example, you might have a situation where a neighborhood has gone downhill. People are blaming immigrants. Now you can of course say: we are going to improve the social economic situation, since that is the long term solution. But in the short term you might then also want to fund more police there to give people a direct sense of safety and being taken serious, where that last one is changing your platform a bit.

That doesn't change anything, because then you increase the feelings of insecurity among the migrant population, which will only increase the lack of perspective and exacerbate all sociological problems you can associate with them. 

Migrants are people too. You keep talking about ""the people"" while implicitly excluding anyone with a migrant background.

&gt;Never claimed that. I said that those far right voters feel that way.

So you think we should submit to that feeling rather than offering alternative views? No thank you.

&gt;A few losing elections means handing over power for 10-20 years. Do you want to hand over power to the far right for that period? Sounds pretty bad to me. Also means that you will be picking up the pieces and trying to change things later on again for at least a decade (look at the mess Trump is making in America, that is impacting the country for decades to come, all because the working class in some states felt left behind).

We're really not anywhere close to that. And no, denouncing the racists as racist has been effective at keeping the far right out of power.

And really, if we start implementing racist policies ourselves by ""slightly adapting our platform"" (which is your newspeak for ""copy the migration policies of the extreme right), then we might as well take the risk, let them take the blame for everything they fuck up *if* they end up in power, and the blame for everything they *can't* solve, while still maintaining our credibility as alternative.

882,"&gt;You just increased demand

You don't increase demand by capping rent. We're talking about housing, not coca-cola. Literally everyone needs a place to live - i.e.  inelastic demand. The only increase in demand I can imagine is people choosing to rent rather than to buy or people being more readily open to the idea of renting rather than staying in their parents housing. And immigrants do not just move somewhere because rent is low.

&gt; The housing is the current bottleneck 

You mean as in lack of available empty apartments? Could I see your sources? 

&gt; You dont solve the problem by artificially lowering supply.  

This implies these apartments will stop existing. They will continue to exist, it's just that the real estate profits for those owning them will be much smaller. Again - this does not mean they will not rent them out - why would they get no money whatsoever? 

Preferable scenario for me  would be that the rent cap would go hand in hand with a nationalization of apartments from those landowners who do not want to rent out for such *low* prices for m^(2) , and just doing away with this whole insane profiteering off of real-estate which adds literally no added value to our societies or economies.

&gt; These flats will deteoriate and crumble into shit while nobody will renovate or build. 

Neat, have building renovation done via taxation for nationalized real estate, or use the rent money for renovation - since you do not have to care about profit margins..

978,"&gt; Those left wing parties are failing to reach them, which is the whole point of this discussion. Yes, they could also vote for those, but they don't. So all I am saying is: maybe change your message in such a way that it is still compatible with your core views, but also manages to reach those voters.

Like I already said, that's the basic premise of politics: reaching voters. This is not a new insight.

If you had a *specific* idea, that would be nice.

&gt;The problem is pretty clear: the failure of the left to address the concerns that lead to people voting far right. Whether those concerns are based in reality is not the point, then you need to convince them on an emotional level. Voters are not robots, they are not always rational and neither can you expect that.

Sure, but that really is something different than having the wrong programme or not addressing the problems of the people. Then it's a matter of tailoring communication, quite a different idea.

&gt;And this attitude is exactly how you alienate people. Not agreeing with you? Must be an ally of the far right. Can't be that maybe there is a difference of opinion, no, you are a ""useful idiot"". And one wonders how voters get alienated when talked to like that.

I didn't use it to fob you off, I explicitly said why I think that: because you're supporting the framing of antipolitical thought by claiming that no parties but the extreme right care for the concerns of the people.

&gt;Then be visible with it, make a message around it that reaches people. That is all I am saying: fix your messaging

*That* is particularly different from the other claims. I do agree that this particular situation in the media, in particular social media, is new, and requires additional strategies. Extreme right memes infected that like a virus, so now we need to figure out the antibodies.

&gt;You can't fix things long term if you are losing the battle short term, so sometimes you need to adapt.

I do think that sometimes a disagreement will not be resolved instantly, people need to manifest their choices, and you're still better off by maintaining your credibility by sticking to your principles, even if that means a dip for a few elections.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/bwa8ee/we_already_tried/ey4w079/,silverionmox,1566811068

Many of todays conflicts between Russia and other states are part of not solving those problems before dissolving the Sovjet Union.

Then we have inner problems following the uncontrolled dissolution. Besides the Balts, every new state had huge economical and therefore social consequences to suffer. For example Ukrainian PPP per capita (constant) dropped by around 66% from 1987 to 1997. Ukraine still hasn't got back to former purchasing power.

While Russia has, it has experienced a similar hit to it's economy with all kinds of toxic social consequences from bad demographics, to oligarchy, to a hit in production power or a high raise in corruption compared to soviet times.

1068,"The problem with re-directing tourists to some other place in CZ is that most of them come specifically for Prague. It is by far the most well-known destination in CZ, these days, it's a relatively well-known place around the world, so when people come for a eurotrip, it is often in their program along with places like Paris or Rome. These people want to go to the famous places, not to some town in CZ no one has ever heard of abroad, even if it is pretty too.

At the same time, even if this re-direction was successful, the small cities in CZ are simply not prepared to cope with big numbers of tourists. Even if you re-directed just 1/10 of the tourists, it's still overwhelming for smaller towns. If you want to see the result of such policy, you can only look at ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov, which is a picturesque town in the Southern Bohemia, located conveniently on the way between Prague and Vienna, so many tour agencies included it in its program. 

As a result, the town is totally overrun, especially during the summer season. The tour agencies bus hundreds and hundreds of people there everyday, they get out of their bus, walk around a bit, take selfies, buy a trdeln√≠k and they are gone in a few hours.

you can of course say you're fine with all that happening, but then 1) you'll have to accept that a lot of people will disagree with an argument that's relying on such oversimplified thinking and 2) in the same vein, you should then also reject efforts for natural conservation - it is after all the species' fault for not adapting and dying out.

We even tried to allow the project to integrate but keep us out of that side, with opt outs. All it did was slow the process and build up resentment against the UK. 

The public perception of us, even by you and others in this subreddit, are that we think are special, want our cake etc. Admit it.

This would only have increased as time went on and the pressure to integrate into ever closer union built up. The UK would have to either continue vetoing (building resentment), get kicked out (worse than brexit by far), brexit at a later date (which would have been far more damaging the longer we are in due to it being more complex to disentangle) or Britain gets forced into that integration (which would be tyrannical and build huge resentment against the EU from Britain...probably leading to brexit anyways).

As you can see, at least I hope, leaving was actually the only real choice that could be made if you take the ‚ÄúBritish are opposed to further integration‚Äù statement to be true. I do take it to be true, which means I was forced to vote leave. It‚Äôs why a lot of other Brits voted to leave too.

Unfortunately we get labelled as racists and xenophobes, get called ignorant idiots who fell for a lie.


I disagree fundamentally that the UK is going to be at the whim of other countries. If that‚Äôs the case then Canada, Australia, Brazil etc are also utterly at the whim of these countries.

1320,"You know what?

Like I said, I know what you're doing; you're just deflecting and ignoring any source that criticizes Stalinism, while claiming I'm ignorant, so...

Here is the full and unabridged list of sources I used to inform my beliefs. Remember: you criticized me for having ""a handful of unreliable sources"" so this is my refutation to that.

Here is a specific article, from the US Library of Congress, about the archives of the KGB during what is known as The Red Terror, or De-Kulakization. [Source](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/reps.html) It is broken up into pages of Soviet archives and is quite extensive. I could provide a summary for you, but you've said you distrust those things, so there's the primary source. If you'd rather have books, you can read Wheatcroft's From *Team Stalin to Degenerate Tyranny* for the nature of Soviet decision-making; Svolik's *Politics of Authoritarian Rule* for a theoretical model of autocracy; and either Lewin's *Soviet Century* or Getty's *Road to Terror* for the emerging role of Stalin in the early 1930s.

The documentation for this is *extensive*.

But hey, why rely on books. [Here's a translation of a speech from Joseph Stalin himself, on December 27th, 1929](https://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/111stalin.html).

Notice how Stalin talks about the Kulak farms and what they produce. There are only two matters to be discussed here; the Soviet farms, and the Kulak farms. One must be one or the other and cannot be neither. Owning the smallest, most independent, tinest privately owned farm made one a Kulak; and for that, they had to die. He *specifically* said they had to be eliminated and could not join the collective farms. They had to be eliminated.

1347,"iirc the reasoning for the 25% tax on capital gains is that it makes no sense to compare just that part to the regular income tax as the former is only the second half of a two-stage taxation of profits distributed to shareholders. 

In principle, the total taxation of profits distributed to the owners should be the same in personal companies (be they unipersonal or partnerships) and corporations. But while the profit distributions of the former are taxed in a single step at the level of the owners (as regular income tax), the taxation in the second case is a two-step system where tax is already paid on the profits at the level of the corporation itself and the 25% at distribution is only the second step of that two-step system that in sum corresponds to the income tax in the case of personal companies (unipersonal or partnerships).

1449,"&gt; Are you talking about the discussed budget, or the monetary discussions in the exit negotiations? Because with the former it's irrelevant, as upon exit the UK is a separate entity from the EU; and if the latter then the EU itself shuts that down with its 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed' rhetoric. 

My initial point was that the discussion about if the UK will have to respect its monetary commitments under the 2014-2020 budget came much later than the negotiations about that budget. No on ine 2013 or 2014 said ""But we will only pay this if we can just move away from what we agree to here!"" as it was applied above.


&gt; Member states, individually or grouped up, could not bring a case against the UK since it would be the EU organisation that had a grievance, not the members. 

The EU ""organisation"" would probably settle the grievance if UK would remain part of the EU jurisdiction, but it will be the member states that have the grievance as they will have to close the holes that Brexit will tear into the budget. But why are we even discussing that? The real talking point is that the 27 member states won't engage in trade talks with the UK (through the EU platform) if the UK don't fulfill their monetary commitments. Period! And no talk about legal implications will change that.

Besides, the UK wants to have a deal, right? Or is that just empty talk to silence the ""Remoaners"" and the EU27? The UK want to have access to the EU platforms, be it the trade, security frameworks, passporting, Galileo, and many other things. If they want to have access to these platforms, they will have fulfill certain commitments, now and in the future. The UK can't say ""Haha, we ware out of your little club and don't owe you anything! Alright, and now let's talk about how you can give us access to all your markets and your other platforms!"". 


&gt; Are you being deliberately obtuse, or do you suffer from severe memory loss? Literally one hour ago you claimed that the UK would be dragged before an EU court, and now you're pretending that you didn't say that?

I have said that the EU27 **cannot** drag the UK before an EU court to make them pay once the UK has left the EU and thus its jurisdiction. And for a while now I'm trying to explain that this is irrelevant to the matter at hand. 


&gt; Are you one of those people who think leaving the EU makes you the next North Korea too? 

No, because North Korea actually has trade agreements with other countries. The UK won't even have that. And don't take my statements out of context.


&gt; You do realise that under the EU's deal, they attempted to permanently lock the UK into the EU and place a border either dividing the people of Ireland or the country of the UK? Where's the fairness in that?

First of all, that deal is not meant to be permanent but only to buy time and provide a clean slate to then discuss an actual framework for our future relationship. No one is happy about the backstop, everyone would rather have a proper a trade agreement (but before you mention it, that is not what the Article 50 process was designed for). Secondly, the deal is supposed to prevent a border in Ireland, and the only British ""suggestion"" for an alternative (ignoring for a second that the UK failed for formulate and ratify an actual negotiation position) is to drop the one thing that would prevent that border. It's not hard to understand why such a deal is not very attractive to the EU.

Furthermore being part of the customs union wouldn't lock the UK into the EU. The UK voted to leave the EU. The customs union is not part of the EU (besides, if you weren't completely blinded by your self-delusion about the power of the UK in the world you would realize that it would be a bloody good idea to stay in the customs unions for a couple of years to establish a proper trade regime). Also, any trade relationship with the EU27 will require some sort of alignment with the EU and you should get used to the idea that you cannot escape the EU unless all that talk about reaching a deal with the EU is nothing more than plain nonsense. Nothing we are discussing here will go away unless the UK decides to not have any kind of relationship with Europe in the future.",Niederrhein,/r/europe/comments/cv5lci/britain_will_withhold_37_billion_from_eu_in/ey3w34l/,sverebom,1566775244

1553,"&gt; Pohara Kuca je za tebe glupost ?

Ako veƒá pominje≈° Poharu Kuƒça, za≈°to ne bude≈° po≈°ten i lijepo ka≈æe≈° ≈°to joj je prethodilo? Prije pohare, ti isti Kuƒçi su izdali Crnu Goru, i potƒçinili se Skadarskom veziru, na taj naƒçin se svrstav≈°i na stranu Otomanskog Carstva. Zna≈° kako ide ono - play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

&gt; Druze, i tvoji preci su najmanje 100 godina bili pod kontrolom Turaka, a ni Srbi nisu odmah polozili oruzje, od Bitke na Marici pa do Opsade Smedereva je proslo 88 godina tacno....

Nema sramote u padu Smedereva, niko normalan to ne tvrdi. Sramota se ogleda u tome ≈°to je nakon toga pro≈°lo 345 godina do Prvog srpskog ustanka! Tako, po≈°tedi ti mene izjednaƒçavanjem statusa CG i Srbije. Nakon na≈°ih padova, mi smo ustajali jaƒçi, a tamo daleko, daleko od mora im nijeste smjeli prdnuti od straha!

&gt; Aaaaa pa tako reci, tvoji su od ovih komunistickih nesrecnika, sto su poput zlocinca i zlikovca Jova Kapicica, bacali ljude u jame i mucili ih po Golom otoku...

&gt; I sad ti nije dovoljno sto ste ubijali popove i palili crkve od 1941 do 1945, pa bi to da nastavite ?

Kakvi su da su, ubjedljivo su najmanje zlo bili od svih strana, to je ƒçinjenica sviƒëala se tebi ili ne. Istoriju promijeniti ne mo≈æe≈°, u Jugoslaviji je postojao samo jedan pokret otpora, i to sigurno nijesu bili ƒçetnici! ≈†to se ostaloga tiƒçe, po≈°tedi me tog patetiƒçnog la≈ænog humanizma. Siguran sam da ti puca kurac za sve nevine ≈ærtve, te da njihove ≈ærtve koristi≈° kao paravan za opravdanje onih koji su bili sve sem nevini! 

≈†to se famoznih ubistava popova tiƒçe, mo≈æe≈° se praviti blesav, ali se dobro zna da su po pravilu nije radilo o popovima, nego o ƒçetniƒçkim koljaƒçima u mantiji! Kud ƒáe≈° boljih primjera od recimo Milorada Vukojiƒçiƒáa i Slobodana ≈†iljka. I jedan, i drugi, danas su sveci SPC. To, samo po sebi dovoljno govori o kakvoj se organizaciji radi, da ne pominjem jo≈° ≈°to ratnohu≈°kaƒçku tradiciju iste, te ƒçinjenice da svako malo dr≈æe parastose svakakvoj ƒçetniƒçkoj bagri. Klerofa≈°izam je blaga kvalifikacija, s obzirom o kakvom se otrovu radi! Mo≈æda je to vama u Srbiji posve normalno, ali nama u CG nije i nikad neƒáe biti!

Takoƒëe, po≈°tedi me tog ciniƒçnog i prije svega bezobraznog poku≈°aja da ƒçitavu priƒçu svede≈° na antikomunizam i komunizam. To je potpuno irelevantno, a siguran sam da i ti zna≈° to vrlo dobro.

&gt; Jeste, bio je on katolik, pa je presao na pravoslavlje i tada i pocinje gradnja pravoslavnih crkava u Crnoj Gori, istih onih koje od nas Crnogoraca hoce da otimaju ateisti i kvazi-Dukljanci, poput tebe.

Kao ≈°to i sam zna≈° (ali ne priznaje≈°), do otimanja je do≈°lo nakon 1918, i sve ≈°to ƒáe ovaj zakon uƒçiniti je vratiti prijeƒëa≈°nje stanje. Takoƒëe, nije CG ni prva ni poslednja dr≈æava koja ovo pitanje reguli≈°e na ovaj naƒçin. Francuski zakon je vrlo sliƒçan na≈°em, pa ne vidim da ne≈°to francuzima fali. I neka samo to, nego je i Srpski zakon relativno sliƒçan, pogotovu ≈°to se tiƒçe pitanja svojine. Shodno tome, ako mo≈æe≈°, odgovori mi za≈°to su takvi zakoni dobri za Srbiju i Francusku, dok za Crnu Goru ne valjaju?

Znam da to ne ≈æeli≈° da prizna≈°, ali ovdje se ne radi o vjeri, nego o imperijalistiƒçkim te≈ænjama. A za ostvarenje tih ciljeva, vjera je ni≈°ta drugo do instrument. I to ne bilo koji instrument, nego poslednji koji vam je preostao. Mo≈æe≈° se praviti blesav, ali i sam zna≈° da je tako. Kad ne budete imali tu polugu moƒái nad Crnom Gorom, u vidu SPC, vi ste Crnu Goru trajno izgubili. Zato ste i toliku pra≈°inu podigli oko ovog zakona. Takoƒëe, da te zamolim da me po≈°tedi≈° i te providne patetike u stilu ""ja sam srbin crnogorac imenom i prezimenom"", jer obojica znamo da si iskljuƒçivo srbin.

&gt; Naravno da je Duklja postojala kao drzava, a njeno stanovnistvo su cinili Juzni Sloveni (Srbi i Hrvati) izmesani sa nesto malo Ilira koji su tu ziveli do dolaska Juznih Slovena....

&gt; e sad, to sto vi u svojim ludim glavama ne shvatate da su postojala 3 plemena Juznih Slovena(Hrvati,Srbi i Bugari) od kojih su se prva 2 naselila na podruzje Duklje, nego mislite da su pored ove 3 postojala i plemena Dukljana,Bosnjaka,Makedonaca, jbg to je problem vase 3 izmisljene nacije... (Severno)Makedonci su krenuli da se vracaju u realnost, to ce se desiti i Bosnjacima i vama kvazi-Dukljanima.

Opet ti napominjem da istorija nije ≈°vedski sto, i da ne mo≈æe≈° uzimati ≈°to po≈æeli≈°, a ostalo ostaviti sa strane. Siguran sam da istoriju poznaje≈° dovoljno dobro, da zna≈° da la≈æe≈°, isto kao ≈°to i ja znam da ti la≈æe≈°, te da to radi≈° svjesno. Kad je veƒá tako, koja je svrha tvog laganja? 

Koliko god puta slagao, promijeniti ne mo≈æe≈° ƒçinjenicu da je u DAI (De Administrando Imperio), Konstantina VII Porfirogenita, jasno napisano da Duklju naseljavaju niti Srbi,niti Hrvati, niti Iliri, nego Dukljani! Znam da ti to ne odgovara, ali jebiga, to promijeniti ne mo≈æe≈°, ma koliko to ≈æelio. Takoƒëe, po≈°tedi me te la≈æne ekvivalencije, u vidu poreƒëenja sa Makedoncima i Bo≈°njacima, koja apsolutno nikakve veze sa mozgom nemaju.

&gt; Druze, ja posedujem imovinu u Banjanima i Herceg Novom i mnogobrojnu rodbinu u Banjanima i Niksicu, mislim da u poslednjih 30ak godina mozda 2 godine nisam boravio u CG.

Blago tvojoj rodbini sa tobom, ne sumnjam da su se usreƒáili.

&gt; Prema ovakvoj CG koju vodi kriminalni duet Brano Micunovic-Milo Djukanovic, gde se govornicima srpskog jezika(43% stanovnistva) onemogucava obrazovanje na istom, gde trenutna vladajuca partija poslednjih najmanje 15 godina opstaje na vlasti zahvaljujuci izbornim kradjama i manipulacijama, prema takvoj CG zaista ne mogu da gajim trunku postovanja, ne samo ja, nego bilo koji normalni gradjanin Srbije ili Crne Gore.

Kakvo crno onemoguƒáavanje obrazovanja na srpskom jeziku, o ƒçemu priƒça≈° ƒçovjeƒçe? Svako mo≈æe da bira na kojem ƒáe jeziku da se ≈°koluje, isto kao ≈°to svako mo≈æe birati na kojem pismu ƒáe mu se izdavati dokumenta. Ako ≈æeli≈° neki dokument dobiti na srpskom jeziku, napisan ƒáiriliƒçnim pismom, niko te u tome sprijeƒçiti ne mo≈æe. Shodno tome, ne la≈æi da se onemoguƒáava obrazovanje na srpskom jeziku. 

≈†to se pak izbora tiƒçe, ne sporim da ima petljanja i muljanja, ali ono nije kljuƒçni razlog ≈°to DPS opstaje na vlasti. Kljuƒçni razlog je ƒçinjenica da jako veliki udio biraƒçkog tijela opoziciju gledano kao cjelinu percipira kao goru od DPS-a, kao i strah, bilo za vlastite interese, bilo za samu dr≈æavu u sluƒçaju dolaska opozicije na vlast. U opravdanost ovih faktora neƒáu ulaziti, jer mi je muka da napi≈°em jo≈° jedan esej.

≈†to se kraƒëe izbora tiƒçe, ona nije ni 1/10 dio onoga ≈°to smo imali 90-ih, u to budi siguran. Ovo va≈æi i za CG, i za Srbiju. Tada broj glasaƒçkih listiƒáa praktiƒçno nije bio regulisan, a povrh toga, nije se adekvatno regulisao ni sam proces glasanja, a glasaƒçke kutije su priƒça za sebe. U to vrijeme se lagano moglo na takve mahinacije moglo navuƒái par procenata, danas to nije sluƒçaj. Po meni, veƒái i dublji, i neuporedivo te≈æi problem za rije≈°iti je ≈°to su i kod vas i kod nas stvoreni sistemi u kojima je kupovina glasova sasvim normalna stvar. No, za tako ne≈°to, potrebne su dvije strane - onaj ko kupuje, i onaj ko ~~se kurva~~ prodaje glas.

Capitalism sucks because of humans. And attempts at communism failed because of humans. There is nothing simply or clearly dumb about these in a vacuum.

It was a pretty relaxing place to visit - It's a family friendly location meaning, no clubs, big crowds, loud music, just nice mostly clean beaches, restaurants with nice atmosphere - a lot of them with panoramic view of the sea, good food and polite staff. Oh and sand dunes, I never knew there are sand dunes in Bulgaria until last week, that's pretty cool. There's also and old town with narrow stone paved roads and wooden houses. The old town is pretty commercial though (think Venice but a bit more toned down) - still definitely worth taking a few walks to admire the rustic architecture. Now on the other end of the beach spectrum is Sunny Beach where I took this picture. If you want big crowds of people, clubbing, loud music, lots of tourist traps, that's one place to be. I only visited it for one day and it was plenty. As for the rest of Bulgaria, I only visited it shortly while crossing it. Sofia for instance at a glance looked to me like an ordinary eastern European capital - in places it reminded me of Bucharest (where I live). It's nice for a visit. Worth mentioning is that they don't really speak English. They do to a certain extent in tourist destinations but even then I had to use Google Translate several times.

2295,"The cheap animals we eat is not a first world problem but a first world embarrassment.     
Short version: animals are treated like slaves, exaggerated example at the moment:    
To maximize production of chicken meat (kg/m2/year) on a 'fixed' size farm you want maximum chickens/m2, they like their privacy so you just burn-off their beaks to prevent production loss from battle damage, often don't bother with (expensive because people) veterinarian checks but just feed them antibiotics anyway, and saturate them with growth hormone for a high turnover.    
 
The 'animal rights' activists want ""humane treatment"" (until they're butchered, and without transport stress on the way to the slaughterhouse), chickens scrounging in the yard, pigs playing in the mud, and cows in a meadow.      

That's expensive(-ish), less animals/m2 (room to move), more medical costs (individual animals get checked, but less money needed for 'precautionary' antibiotics), and less kg/year (no growth hormones).      
 
In the Netherlands the tv-ads ""Stop the 'plof kip' and 'kiloknaller meat' are fairly successful to start this change from the bottom up (customer demand), better labeling (certificate of origin) explains the higher price, and much more veggie alternatives in the shops (which Aldi/Lidl/Hema/Jumbo/etc won't do if they don't make at least a little profit).",Flevoland,/r/europe/comments/cuph2a/boris_johnsons_cheerleaders_are_delusional_no/ey21ozm/,mrCloggy,1566720264

2348,"&gt;They are using terms and phrases like ""100% up to the interviewer"" and arbitrary. That implies that there is no process

It does not, no. Let me give you a comparison, and see if you can figure out why you're wrong on your own.

There are laws. The laws determine what you can and cannot dom who enforces those laws?

Cops. Now, we have literally thousands of examples where cops pull people over, and do illigal things. Searching your car illegally, they decide if they want to ticket you. If you so much as smile the wrong way, you can get a ticket. And sure, that ticket may not be legal. Does it matter? No. But the cop gets ultimate authority. And until we see some actual discipline when cops do this, you could SAY that cops are able to do whatever they want. 

Now, does that mean there ARENT laws? Does that mean they HAVE no regulation? Does that mean ALL cops act that way? No.

But to assume all cops will NOT abuse that authority ""because laws exist"" is the way the world seems like to a toddler.

Your link does not support your own conclusion, particularly not ""PER SE"" because nothing in that article is about ""soil not being rich anymore"". But it does point out that forests do not automatically ""neutralize carbon"", but they act much more like a natural carbon sink, carbon storage so to speak:  


&gt; Tropical forests previously acted as a vital carbon ‚Äúsink‚Äù, taking carbon from the atmosphere and turning it into oxygen, but the trend has reversed: they now emit almost twice as much carbon as they consume. 

Which according to the very same article happens because:  


&gt; So much of the Earth‚Äôs forest has been destroyed that the tropics now emit more carbon than they capture, scientists have found.   
   
More than 60 per cent of emissions in the tropics comes from Latin America, **which has witnessed large-scale damage to the Amazon rainforest in recent years**. 24 per cent comes from Africa and 16 per cent from Asia.¬† 

Which the INPE table about Amazon forest fires confirms: This century has seen constant new record numbers in fires. You go from that to:  


&gt; Density/biomass of Amazon will naturally decrease. 

Which none of your two sources support, to then proclaim:  


&gt; The carbon emission in Amazon due to storms only is about [86% of Amazon carbon consumption](https://www.livescience.com/44235-amazon-rainforest-carbon-cycle-measured.html). 

Which is an article based on a 3 years older study, making the same point about the forests acting as a carbon sink, and how it gets released when trees get destroyed by storms. It does not say storms do not ""consume carbon"", and as such does also not have any 86% number on ""Amazon carbon consumption by storms"".  


But yes, storms destroy trees that's bad, do you know what's gonna very likely increase the frequency and intensity of storms? Climate change.  
I don't even know where you are going with all of this except ""Marcon media team used an exemplary picture!"", ""Reuters uses wrong numbers!"" and ""Omg look at these propaganda tweets by random ass users!"" when you mix in these bold claims about the fires being all regenerative, and supporting them with sources that do not even remotely say what you claim.

&gt;Hence, equal right here is still in principle -- bourgeois right, although principle and practice are no longer at loggerheads, while the exchange of equivalents in commodity exchange exists only on the average and not in the individual case.

&gt;In spite of this advance, this equal right is still constantly stigmatized by a bourgeois limitation. The right of the producers is proportional to the labor they supply; the equality consists in the fact that measurement is made with an equal standard, labor. 

&gt;But one man is superior to another physically, or mentally, and supplies more labor in the same time, or can labor for a longer time; and labor, to serve as a measure, must be defined by its duration or intensity, otherwise it ceases to be a standard of measurement. This equal right is an unequal right for unequal labor. It recognizes no class differences, because everyone is only a worker like everyone else; but it tacitly recognizes unequal individual endowment, and thus productive capacity, as a natural privilege. It is, therefore, a right of inequality, in its content, like every right. Right, by its very nature, can consist only in the application of an equal standard; but unequal individuals (and they would not be different individuals if they were not unequal) are measurable only by an equal standard insofar as they are brought under an equal point of view, are taken from one definite side only -- for instance, in the present case, are regarded only as workers and nothing more is seen in them, everything else being ignored. Further, one worker is married, another is not; one has more children than another, and so on and so forth. Thus, with an equal performance of labor, and hence an equal in the social consumption fund, one will in fact receive more than another, one will be richer than another, and so on. To avoid all these defects, right, instead of being equal, would have to be unequal.

&gt;SINCE THE 1970s nearly 800,000km¬≤ of Brazil‚Äôs original 4m km¬≤ (1.5m  square miles) of Amazon forest has been lost to logging, farming,  mining, roads, dams and other forms of development‚Äîan area equivalent to  that of Turkey and bigger than that of Texas. Scientists worry this is  uncomfortably close to the threshold for tree loss, of between 20 and  25%, beyond which deforestation begins to feed on itself, turning much  of the Amazon basin into drier savannah known as cerrado. Under Jair  Bolsonaro, the right-wing president of Brazil who was inaugurated in  January, the Amazon appears to be rushing towards that tipping point.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  deforestation rate had slowed between 2004 and 2012, when the  government beefed up its environmental protection agency, Ibama, and an  international Amazon Fund was created to pay for conservation projects.  But it began ticking up again after a weakening of environmental  legislation and budget cuts during Brazil‚Äôs recession of 2014-2016.  Between August 2017 and July 2018 Brazil lost 7,900km¬≤ of Amazon  forest‚Äînearly a billion trees. This year‚Äôs figure is almost sure to be  higher. Preliminary satellite data showed that 920 km¬≤ were cleared in  June, 88% more than the same month in 2018. In July 2,255 km¬≤ were  cleared, a startling 278% more than the same month last year (see  chart).  
&gt;  
&gt;Environmentalists  blame Mr Bolsonaro‚Äôs insouciance about the Amazon. It is a ‚Äúvirgin‚Äù  that should be ‚Äúexploited‚Äù for agriculture, mining and infrastructure  projects, he says. The environment minister, Ricardo Salles, fired 21 of  Ibama‚Äôs 27 heads; he has yet to replace most of them, crippling the  agency‚Äôs enforcement duties. In response to increasing alarm about the  jump in tree-clearing, Mr Bolsonaro fired the head of the agency that  tracks deforestation, called the data ‚Äúlies‚Äù and told a journalist that  those concerned about the environment should eat less and ‚Äúshit every  other day.‚Äù When Germany announced on August 10th that it was cutting  35m euros ($39.6m) of funding for conservation projects, Mr Bolsonaro  said that ‚ÄúBrazil doesn‚Äôt need it.‚Äù

2571,"&gt; The Amazon is approaching an irreversible tipping point

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;THE AMAZON basin,  most of which sits within the borders of Brazil, contains 40% of the  world‚Äôs tropical forests and accounts for 10-15% of the biodiversity of  Earth‚Äôs continents. Since the 1970s nearly 800,000km¬≤ of Brazil‚Äôs  original 4m km¬≤ (1.5m square miles) of Amazon forest has been lost to  logging, farming, mining, roads, dams and other forms of development‚Äîan  area equivalent to that of Turkey, and bigger than that of Texas. Over  the same period, the average temperature in the basin has risen by about  0.6¬∞C. This century, the region has suffered a series of severe  droughts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Both the reduction in tree coverage and the change in  climate were endangering the forest‚Äôs future well before Brazil‚Äôs  general elections of October 2018. But after that the forest faced  another threat: Jair Bolsonaro, the new president, and arguably the most  environmentally dangerous head of state in the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;From  2004 to 2012 the rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon slowed.  The government‚Äôs environmental protection agency, Ibama, was  strengthened. Other countries, and global NGOs, nagged  and encouraged; in 2008 an international Amazon Fund was created to help  pay for protection. Not a moment too soon, said rainforest scientists.  They had begun to suspect that, if tree loss passed a certain threshold,  the deforestation would start to feed on itself. Beyond this  tipping-point, forest cover would keep shrinking whatever humans might  try to do to stop it. Eventually much of the basin would be drier  savannah, known as *cerrado*. As well as spelling extinction for  tens of thousands of species, that devastation would change weather  patterns over much of South America and release into the atmosphere tens  of billions of tonnes of carbon, worsening global warming.

&gt;This hopeful period of slower deforestation was not to last. Even  before Mr Bolsonaro, deforestation began to tick up (see chart 1). In  2012, under then-president Dilma Rousseff, Brazil‚Äôs congress passed a  new forest code that gave amnesty to those who had taken part in illegal  deforestation before 2008. In 2017 Michel Temer, the next president,  signed a law that streamlined the privatisation of occupied public  lands, which spurred land grabs in the Amazon. During the deep recession  of 2014-16 the environment ministry‚Äôs budget was slashed. Between  August 2017 and July 2018 Brazil lost 7,900km¬≤ of Amazon forest‚Äînearly a  billion trees‚Äîthe highest rate of deforestation for a decade.  
&gt;  
&gt;Heaven‚Äôs high canopy  
&gt;  
&gt;According  to preliminary satellite data, since Mr Bolsonaro took office in  January, the Amazon has lost roughly 4,300km¬≤ of forest, which means  this year‚Äôs total will surely outstrip last year‚Äôs. This is not a fluke.  The president appears to want the country to return to the time of  Brazil‚Äôs military dictatorship, when big infrastructure projects  prompted widespread destruction in the name of development.  
&gt;  
&gt;A few  of Mr Bolsonaro‚Äôs plans have been curbed. Pressure from Tereza Cristina,  the agriculture minister, and the farm lobby led him to withdraw his  threat to leave the Paris climate agreement and from abolishing the  environment ministry‚Äîmostly because deals with disapproving European  firms would be at risk. A bill introduced by Fl√°vio Bolsonaro, the  president‚Äôs eldest son and a senator in his own right, to eliminate a  requirement for farmers to preserve some natural vegetation on land they  clear has not yet passed. The supreme court blocked a decree to  transfer powers over the demarcation of indigenous reserves from the  justice ministry to Ms Cristina‚Äôs‚Äîwhich would have ‚Äúput the fox in  charge of the chicken coop,‚Äù argues Randolfe Rodrigues, an opposition  senator.  
&gt;  
&gt;But even without the biggest changes, Mr Bolsonaro‚Äôs  government can still encourage, directly or indirectly, a large amount  of deforestation, by not enforcing the laws that prohibit it. On  February 28th the environment minister, Ricardo Salles, fired 21 of  Ibama‚Äôs 27 state heads, following the president‚Äôs orders to ‚Äúclean out‚Äù  the agency. Most have yet to be replaced, including all but one in the  Amazon states. The environment ministry has started to flag up in  advance where and when anti-logging operations will take place. Between  January and May, Ibama imposed the lowest number of fines for illegal  deforestation in a decade.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Salles says that ‚Äúthe role of the  state is to protect landowners‚Äô property rights‚Äù. He wants to use  donations from Norway and Germany to the 3.6bn reais ($950m) Amazon Fund  to compensate landowners for land that had been turned into  conservation areas, even though most of it was occupied illegally.  
&gt;  
&gt;Deforesters  appear emboldened. According to the Indigenist Missionary Council, a  Catholic group, the number of illegal invasions in indigenous areas has  jumped. On July 24th miners with guns invaded a village in the northern  state of Amap√°, killed one of its leaders and expelled the residents.  Satellite data show a drastic rise in the year-on-year deforestation  rate starting in May, the beginning of the dry season. In July, more  than 1,800km¬≤ was cleared, three times more than last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;These  statistics tell only part of the story. The Amazon matters to the global  climate because it is a sink of carbon, mitigating warming. If the  rainforest were to die back, the large amount of greenhouse gases this  would release would speed up that process. But the climate matters to  the Amazon, too. It is sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall,  as well as to atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Amazon is  unique among tropical rainforests in that it produces a lot of its own  rainfall. As moisture travels from the Atlantic to Peru, the Amazon‚Äôs  trees recycle some of it; around half the forest‚Äôs rain is reused this  way. Rainwater is pulled up from the roots to the canopy, where it is  released back to the atmosphere to fall as rain again. Not only does  this provide moisture to the region, the evaporation off the leaves also  has a local cooling effect.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is what has led to worries about  tipping-points. In an influential paper in 2007 Gilvan Sampaio and  Carlos Nobre of Brazil‚Äôs National Institute for Space Research forecast  that, were 40% of the forest to perish, the loss of water-recycling  capacity would mean very little of the rest would have enough rainfall  to survive.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trees rudely hollowed  
&gt;  
&gt;Alongside the threat  from deforestation, the forest‚Äôs capacity to water itself can be  weakened by rising temperatures. Beatriz Marimon and Ben Hur Marimon, at  the University of Mato Grosso in Nova Xavantina, have kept tabs for  decades on dozens of plots in the *transi√ß√£o*, the margin between the wet Amazon and the drier *cerrado*.  Today, Mr Marimon says, they are seeing ‚Äútwo warmings in one‚Äù. On top  of global warming are changes that result from deforestation, which  removes the air-conditioning effect provided by water evaporating from  the trees‚Äô leaves.",,/r/europe/comments/cv255j/deforestation_in_the_amazon_may_soon_begin_to/ey1e8j6/,JazSemMefisto,1566697293

&gt; A study by Divino Silv√©rio and colleagues at the Amazon Environmental  Research Institute, published in 2015, found that converting forest to  pasture increased land temperatures by 4.3¬∞C; if pasture was then turned  over to arable crops, things warmed a little more. The *transi√ß√£o*  is already hotter and drier than most of the rainforest. Clearing more  of its patchwork of forest, farms and savannah makes the remaining  woodland even hotter.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ms Marimon has also observed that  temperatures above 40¬∞C dry out trees, making them more likely to fall  in strong winds. The fragmentation brought about by farming creates  isolated patches of forest. If they lose access to seed banks in the  soil and water sources, such disconnected fragments are less able to  recover.  
&gt;  
&gt;How plants respond to carbon-dioxide levels probably  exacerbates matters. The more carbon dioxide in the air, the less air  plants need to process in order to photosynthesise. The less air they  take in, the less water vapour they let out. As a consequence, the  plants both do less to cool their immediate environment (because less  water evaporates) and also make the atmosphere less moist. This has been  shown to be happening in other watersheds, though there is not yet  conclusive evidence from the Amazon.  
&gt;  
&gt;Clearances also lead to local  drying. Satellite data show that air which passes over primary  rainforest produces twice as much rain a few days later than that which  passes over farmland. In 2012 scientists at the University of Leeds  predicted that continued deforestation would cause rainfall in the  Amazon to drop by 12% in the wet season and by 21% in the dry season by  2050.  
&gt;  
&gt;The forest‚Äôs dry season started to lengthen in the 1970s;  the rains which used to come in October now come in November. This might  have been an effect of deforestation; there is some evidence that water  returned to the atmosphere by trees is particularly important in  getting the rainy season going. The most dramatic effect of drying seen  by scientists, though, is not a shorter wet season. It is the  disproportionate impact of the years in which rainfall is particularly  low.

[https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20190803\_FBC904.png](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20190803_FBC904.png)

&gt; This century has already seen three unusually harsh droughts, in  2005, 2010 and 2015. That of 2015 corresponds to an El Ni√±o event‚Äîa  see-saw effect in Earth‚Äôs climate whereby a shift in the flow of energy  between the atmosphere and the ocean in the central Pacific produces a  predictable pattern of climate anomalies all through the tropics and  beyond (see chart 2). The correlation between El Ni√±o events and  droughts in the Amazon, most notably in the south-eastern part, predates  human activities. But those activities may, at a global level, increase  the frequency and intensity of El Ni√±o events. At the local level they  worsen the damage that droughts do.  
&gt;  
&gt;The El Ni√±o drought in 2015  was particularly severe. In Nova Xavantina more than a third of the  trees in some of the Marimons‚Äô study plots died in its aftermath. The  region around the city of Santar√©m, farther north and deep in the  Amazon, saw flames as tall as buildings tear through the forest,  enveloping the canopy in thick black smoke that stretched for miles and  turned the sunlight red. For months after the fires died down, the  forest floor smouldered. Hundred-year-old trees dried out and died.  
&gt;  
&gt;Nearly  four years later, the forest is still recovering. At one part of the  Tapaj√≥s National Forest reserve, where 580km¬≤ (11% of the total area)  burned, saplings have shot up among the ashes of their giant forebears,  but it will be years before they form a canopy. A second round of fires  in 2017 burned nearly a quarter of another reserve, where 75 communities  of river-dwellers make their living fishing and hunting.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fires  are not new to the Amazon, but recently they seem to have been more  frequent and intense. This kicks off a vicious cycle. Dead trees open  gaps in the canopy, allowing more light and wind to reach the forest  floor, which becomes hotter, drier and more prone to burn again. This  year is expected to be a mild El Ni√±o year, which means higher  temperatures and less rain for the area around Santar√©m. Fires could  rage again. If that happens, says Joice Ferreira, a biologist at the  Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, the debris left over from  the previous fires will serve as fuel for the flames. ‚ÄúAfter that,‚Äù she  says, ‚Äúthere won‚Äôt be many trees left.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Over the past 50 years 17%  of the rainforest has been lost, some way from the 40% tipping-point  proposed in 2007. But last year Mr Nobre and Thomas Lovejoy of George  Mason University, after taking account of climate change and fire as  well as deforestation, revised the estimate of the threshold to 20-25%.  That is uncomfortably close to today‚Äôs figure. Mr Nobre says the recent  droughts and floods could be the ‚Äúfirst flickers‚Äù of permanent change.  Carlos Rittl of the Brazilian Climate Observatory, a consortium of  research outfits, expects Mr Bolsonaro‚Äôs tenure to see deforestation  pass 20%. If Mr Lovejoy and Mr Nobre are right, that could be  disastrous‚Äîonce the tipping-point is transgressed, much of the rest of  the forest could follow in just a matter of decades.",,/r/europe/comments/cv255j/deforestation_in_the_amazon_may_soon_begin_to/ey1ebp8/,JazSemMefisto,1566697359

&gt;To shade the barren wild  
&gt;  
&gt;Even  now, the service that the Amazon provides the rest of the world as a  sink for carbon dioxide appears to be declining. Simon Lewis of  University College London, and colleagues, analysed observations of 321  plots across the Amazon basin. They found that in primary forests plants  absorb, on average, a third less carbon dioxide than they did in the  1990s, owing to increasing tree mortality. In a paper published in 2011  Mr Lewis argued that carbon lost to the atmosphere through tree death  and fire in the droughts of 2005 and 2010 might offset as much as a  decade‚Äôs worth of carbon-dioxide absorption by the forest.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not  everyone is so gloomy. Forests that are diverse, like the Amazon, are  likely to have drought-resistant species that can fill the niche left by  drought-prone ones without a loss of biomass, points out Kirsten  Thonicke of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, a German  think-tank. Secondary forests store significant amounts of carbon,  though far less than primary ones. One study found that as a secondary  forest grows, it recovers 1.2% carbon storage per year, so a 20-year-old  secondary forest would store roughly 25% of the carbon stored by a  primary forest. There are ways to mitigate the biomass loss from logging  and ranching, by being careful about which trees to cut and reforesting  afterwards. In Paris Brazil pledged not just to halt illegal  deforestation by 2030 but also to reforest 120,000km¬≤.  
&gt;  
&gt;Such  attempts at mitigation look increasingly unlikely. In June Mr Bolsonaro  published a decree which indefinitely extends the 2019 deadline for  farmers to begin replanting illegally deforested land. This not only  reduces the chances of reforestation. It reinforces the message: the  government will turn a blind eye to more. Similarly, if his son‚Äôs bill  were to pass it would legalise the deforestation of some 1.5m km¬≤.  Clearing that would emit nearly 65bn tonnes of carbon dioxide‚Äîequivalent  to Brazil‚Äôs emissions over the past 27 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;In July President  Bolsonaro called deforestation data ‚Äúlies‚Äù and said he wanted to review  them before they were released to the public. Hamilton Mour√£o, the  vice-president, says that other countries‚Äô professed concern for the  Amazon masks ‚Äúcovetousness‚Äù for precious minerals in the region. Mr  Salles, the environment minister, likes to point out that many rich  countries cut down their own forests but have not fulfilled promises to  pay Brazil not to do the same. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt give Brazil the onus of being  the world‚Äôs lungs without any benefits,‚Äù he argues.  
&gt;  
&gt;The trees stood bare  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr  Salles is right that the countries responsible for the bulk of  emissions should compensate Brazil for its role in absorbing them. In  return Brazil must protect, rather than destroy, the rainforest. In June  a trade deal between the EU and Mercosur‚ÄîBrazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay‚Äîwas announced at the G20  summit, which includes a commitment to implement the Paris climate  agreement. It has yet to be approved; it is also unclear how much it  will sway the president to curb his infrastructure plans, or indeed his  rhetoric.  
&gt;  
&gt;Concerns about what Brazil‚Äôs climate policies might do  to the country‚Äôs reputation could spur local resistance to Mr  Bolsonaro‚Äôs anti-environmental turn. Fears for the climate itself may  yet do more. ‚ÄúWe have no doubt that the forest has a direct effect on  the rain cycle,‚Äù says Artemizia Moita, the sustainability director of a  farming group that has 530km¬≤ of soyabean and cattle farms. ‚ÄúIf we keep  deforesting,‚Äù she asks, ‚Äúhow will we keep producing?‚Äù Unlike other  farmers she admits she is worried about climate change.  
&gt;  
&gt;For many,  any shift in attitudes will already come too late. Magdalena is an  elderly woman who has spent her life as a river-dweller in one of the  rainforest‚Äôs reserves. She used to hunt deer and armadillo to make her  living. Now she treks 13km to buy beef from a local village. ‚ÄúAll the  game is gone,‚Äù she laments.",,/r/europe/comments/cv255j/deforestation_in_the_amazon_may_soon_begin_to/ey1ec6h/,JazSemMefisto,1566697369

2629,"I've seen coverage interviewing for example a general professor on Brasil, who thought it all seemed a bit overdramatic. At the same time, the Dutch public broadcaster also talked to an Amazon biology expert who was seriously worried. Even though this particular season may be an overreaction, is it one on the long term? Logging is still continuing, and at some point we reach breaking point after which the ecosystem essentially collapses because the forests won't be able to generate enough rain to protect itself from increased drought.

They also talked to a member of Bolsonaro's party, who said that they perceived the international pressure as an attack on ""their Amazon"" and that France and Ireland etc. don't really care about the forests but only economic development which of course runs on a model that is destroying the earth. And even though the majority of the Amazon rainforest falls within Brazil's national borders, I think we cannot afford to think nationally when it comes to global issues The Amazon generates oxygen and rain for multiple continents and is worldwide importance to the climate.

Of course, I have to say he is right somewhere. The whole deal is engineered so that more cheap beef can produced in Brazil and exported to Europe, which hurts European producers and only perpetuates the agricultural practices and overconsumption of meats which are destroying the planet. If they were more seriously concerned they would have shown so before international critique started building. But at the same time, Bolsonaro has stated multiple times he wants to open it up for economic development even more, showing me he certainly does not give a damn about the health of the forest like his colleague implied. So in the end, I can't say I think it's all just a complete sham and am at least somewhat happy. At the same time, we need a fundamentally new way of thinking which internalised much more the way we are part of and operate in our national environment, towards a more sustainable economy away from endless resource extraction.

2664,"It is not a matter of being biaised, French was spoken in the European court from Russia to Berlin in the 18th century with the Age of Enlightenment. Most common example given was Voltaire tour in Europe from Catherine the Great to Frederic the Great of Prussia.

&gt;He conjectured on history, tackled philosophy and penned verse ‚Äì and he did so all in French, not German. When Frederick received Johann Christoph Gottsched in 1757, he is reported to have admitted that he spoke German like a coachman (‚Äòcomme un cocher‚Äô); French was Frederick‚Äôs preferred language of scholarly and literary discourse. The infamous words supposedly uttered by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (1500-1558) are frequently (mis)attributed to Frederick: that he spoke Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men and German to his horse. Nevertheless, the commonly held belief that Frederick was disparaging of the German language is absolutely correct.

See Tolsto√Ø's *War and Peace*, see how much the author makes his Russian nobles speak French.

&gt; The eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries in Russia were marked by multilingualism among the nobility. The French 
language, in particular, was widely known and used in high society. Indeed, French was 
considered expressively superior to Russian (Offord, Ryazanova-Clarke, Rj√©outski &amp; Argent, 
2015). Then as now, code-switching was a common phenomenon among bilinguals. There were 
subjects discussed specifically in French, and others in Russian, in Tolstoy‚Äôs novel, which 
represents the life in Russia between 1807 and 1812, and which was constructed to reflect the 
nature of the time period and its characteristics. In this paper, using the theoretical model 
proposed by Myers-Scotton (1995) based on markedness, an identification is made of reasons for 
using code-switching. This is correlated with Ren√© Appel and Pieter Muysken‚Äôs (1987) five 
functions of code-switching; and Benjamin Bailey‚Äôs (1999) three functional types of switching. 
A delineation is also made of the types of topics discussed in the French language by the Russian 
aristocracy, the types of code-switching used most frequently, and the base language of code-
switching in Tolstoy‚Äôs novel.

French language as a [lingua Franca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lingua_francas) will last for 2 or three centuries until WWII.

&gt;French was the language of diplomacy from the 17th century until the mid-20th century,[[27]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lingua_francas#cite_note-otte2010-27)¬†and is still a working language of some¬†[international institutions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_organisations_which_have_French_as_an_official_language).

2667,"Interesting, the cooking of New Orleans is supposed to be very good. 

I don't know. Maybe it's culture clash, maybe it is just purely that the French are unfriendly. Or maybe they've unfortunately met Parisians. I'm not all the French citizens, I'm just one of them. One only needs to get out of the more urban areas for Connecticut, and the Adirondacks is a very different part of New York.

Limiting it to bad experiences living there and from American soldiers abroad, I don't have a particularly good view. I've met some Bush era hostility as I've said several times, only bullies, but I've also seen and had to deal with American Soldiers and other tourists who harass women and be overly aggressive to others. All under the umbrella of ""We're here to protect you, you ungrateful Europeans"".

Let me tell you something about ungrateful. The US got many people from NATO countries killed in Afghanistan, and their only response to that is to demand money. Iraq backfired spectacularly, and we're still dealing with the aftermath! Prior history or being a democracy does not give anyone a right to act like they do! I and people can genuinely hold grudges for things like that.

Some (including now the leader) start disputes, make casual threats or insult as a 'joke', but are enraged if someone starts firing back, or whine about something they started. Arrogant? Out of all the people in the world, some Americans have been the most arrogant I've ever met, including the Parisians. It's not only a republican thing either.

I've also read some Americans write about how the rest of the of the world is so ungrateful, and I have to wonder if most Americans are unaware or wonder why that happens.

 Germany trusts Russia more than them! Germany and Denmark were some of the most pro-American countries, and now the former is more anti-American than France! France, the country which policy during the Cold War was ""don't trust or become dependent on the anglosphere"".

I have no better conclusion to say that after all this time, I'm just tired and disgusted of your country, to be frank and complete sincere. I hate how this whining sounds written down, and I've deleted some paragraphs of just more anti-American rants, but the endpoint is that I wish that a lot of the US government and influence ... would go away.

But in order to so the EU needs to ask those countries' governments (especially Poland) to stop being Trump's lapdog in Europe or the very least to have the chain be weaker.

and then i said:

&gt;Cretan civilians joined the battle with whatever weapons were at hand.[\[90\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crete#cite_note-90)   Most civilians went into action armed only with what they could gather   from their kitchens or barns and several German parachutists were  knifed  or clubbed to death in olive groves. In one recorded incident,  an  elderly Cretan man clubbed a parachutist to death with his walking  cane,  before the German could disentangle himself from his parachute.[\[91\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crete#cite_note-91)   In another recorded incident, a local priest and his teenage son broke   into a small village museum and took two rifles from the era of the [Balkan Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Wars)   and sniped at German paratroops at landing zones. The Cretans also  used  captured German small arms. The Crete civilian actions against the   Germans were not limited to harassment; mobs of armed civilians joined   in the Greek counter-attacks at [Kastelli Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kastelli_Hill) and Paleochora; the British and New Zealand advisors at these locations were hard pressed to prevent [massacres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre). Civilians also checked the Germans to the north and west of Heraklion and in the town centre.[\[92\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crete#cite_note-92)

further more, that resistance was so severe that caused this:

&gt;The Battle of Crete was the first occasion during the Second World  War where the German troops encountered widespread resistance from a  civilian population, which initially surprised and later outraged them.  As most Cretan partisans wore no uniforms or insignia such as armbands  or headbands, the Germans felt free of all of the constraints of the  Hague Conventions and killed armed and unarmed civilians  indiscriminately.[\[93\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crete#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBeevor1991342,_235%E2%80%93248-93)[\[e\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crete#endnote_Notee) Immediately after Crete fell, a series of [collective punishments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_punishment)  against civilians began. Between 2 June and 1 August, 195 persons from  the village of Alikianos and its vicinity were killed in mass shootings  known as the [Alikianos executions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alikianos_executions).[\[94\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crete#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKiriakopoulos199532%E2%80%9334-94) On 2 June, several male citizens from [Kondomari were executed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_Kondomari) by a firing squad, with the shootings being captured on film by a German army war correspondent. On 3 June, the village of [Kandanos was razed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razing_of_Kandanos)  to the ground and about 180 of its inhabitants killed. After the war,  Student, who ordered the shootings, avoided prosecution for [war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime), despite Greek efforts to have him extradited.[\[95\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crete#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBeevor1991236,_342-95)

not only that

&gt;Although the conquest of Crete was considered a grandiose victory of the airborne corps,[\[99\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crete#cite_note-99)  the German leadership focused on the heavy losses incurred. The German  Air Ministry was shocked by the number of transport aircraft lost, and  Student, reflecting on the casualties suffered by the paratroopers,  concluded after the war that Crete was the death of the airborne force.  Hitler, believing airborne forces to be a weapon of surprise which had  now lost that advantage, concluded that the days of the airborne corps  were over and directed that paratroopers should be employed as  ground-based troops in subsequent operations in the Soviet Union.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crete#cite_note-Kurowski_p165-166-17)[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crete#cite_note-Beevor_p229-230-18)

resistance in Crete, by civilians and soldiers alike, caused the failure to use paratroopers for the rest of the war by the Germans.

&gt;Due to the number of casualties and the belief that airborne forces no longer had the advantage of surprise, [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) became reluctant to authorise further large airborne operations, preferring instead to employ paratroopers as ground troops.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crete#cite_note-Kurowski_p165-166-17)[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Crete#cite_note-Beevor_p229-230-18) In contrast, the Allies were impressed by the potential of paratroopers and started to form airborne-assault and [airfield-defence regiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Regiment).

2820,"&gt;Support for both the EU and the euro have surged by a fair amount since the referendum. With such parties have been underperforming and have backtrack on promises

I may not have communicated this properly. I do not want a no deal Brexit to occur for some belief there will be political gain.

&gt;I really don‚Äôt think that is true, it seemed to me that he was rather skeptical and wouldn‚Äôt guarantee anything. In the end he was rather satisfied with the prospect of the extension lasting until the new commission takes office.

Exactly. He eventually compromised, as you said because unilateral action, while possible is not popular or good for long-term negotiations. That was the deal however, it was before the new commission and the setting of a budget.

How many extensions are needed? Until the UK promises a new referendum or election? Something that has been done and/or has been botched in the past three years?

&gt;It is not that different from the last time, Article 50 has been triggered and the same party is in power, with mps having many of the same tools as last time.

It's the same MPs, it's the culmination of the same man who has been spinning lies for decades. That's the problem! Unless the electorate has changed, nothing will change even with a new election!

&gt;By refusing an extension the EU would be partially reasonable for throwing Ireland under the bus. Both in terms of the Good Friday agreement and the economic hit to Ireland which would be one of the worst impacted by such a scenario.

""If there is no backstop, or recall of Article 50, than there's little than can be done. Only a different government who accepts the deal is likely to save Good Friday.""
May's government was voted in, and they did nothing. What are we to do if the new election fails, and another clown gets into power? 

I don't want Ireland to be hit, but the government doesn't change. Is the solution to delay Brexit forever, until the costs become negligible or another solution has been found?

That may not be a bad idea...

&gt;Allowing another extension over not is definitely the best thing that the EU can do, if the UK requests one. Even if certain terms are attached at least the EU can make it clear that no deal is the UK‚Äôs responsibility and that it will still be free to revoke Article 50 at any time while it is still in the EU.

You're more optimistic than I am. This mess is a culmination of the UK's leadership's own actions, and the EU is still blamed. I suspect the situation can get worse either way.

&gt;We have been here before already. Last time I was adamant that there would be an extension and the same doubts came before, with people on here claiming that no deal was guaranteed. Then, you know what? An extension was agreed upon and I don‚Äôt see the current situation being that much different now. Neither would it be a good idea for the EU to refuse it the way that certain people on here seem to want.

I also predicted that Boris Johnson would get into power, despise that being a joke because assuming the worst has been a good indicator for me. I predicted that the UK parliament would vote 'No' against everything. It's precisely because nothing has changed despite the extension, that I don't many will agree to it.

Unless there's an outright provision that the UK must call for new elections for an extension (which I'm sure some could spin as the EU demanded another undemocratic recall vote or something), or a referendum, than another extension is pointless. We'll have the same problem almost one year after they should have left.",France,/r/europe/comments/cutx1f/flowchart_of_possible_brexit_outcomes_as_of_20/ey03adm/,frissio,1566673811

The transition from socialist to communist has never happened anywhere, so by definition there have never been any communist countries and right now it would take a long time.

No because they threatened to leave also the court. But even if, would Lithuania pay then?

&gt;Lifting sanctions would benefit Russian citizens too.

But only a very little group, as sanctions that hurt most Russian citizens were those Russia implemented.


&gt;Accepting Russia to G8 would benefit citizens too by showing to international partners that their country is reasonable.

Trump is at the G7. But in anyway this argument isn't really one

2912,"&gt; Stripping a group of people of their culture (reeducation camps, destruction of ancient architecture, forcing them into breaking their religious tenets) or their ability to keep said culture (castration, forced mixed marriages, taking away children) is ethnic cleansing.

Not according to the definition. Ethnic cleansing, from everything I've read, requires either forced permanent removal or mass-killings.

You *could* say that forced reeducation would ""kill off the culture"" and that this is bad, but then it needs to have its own term (and probably has?). You can't just re-interpret existing terminology in order to retroactively expand its scope. It has the negative connotation of using this term just for populist opinion-shaping, similar to the people who claim rescuing shipwrecked migrants constitutes human trafficking.

Providing social security based on demographics still leaves plenty of room for adjustments.

Of the examples I talked about and which I have some level of experience with, only France looks high with 8.7%, but Macron's reforms seem to be pushing it down successfully. Maybe the French just overshot the target back then, given how much stricter labor protections are compared to Germany or Ireland.

3023,"&gt; I think that Europe's ""social market economy"" has been pretty outdated since the 1980s and can't deliver the prosperity it used to.

European governments had to give in to the pressure of US-style Turbo-capitalism, free trade dogmatism and later the infamous neo-liberalism, if they wanted to keep their companies at least somewhat competitive. 

But that's not a success story, it's just a race to the bottom. Now workers compete with Chinese wages and social security turned into insecurity. Inequality increased and extremists on the left and right are on the rise. Maybe that's how you like it, but I'd prefer it a bit more calm, peaceful and ""social"".

They ignore the evilness of the US, but they ignore the evilness of their countries as well so as a whole that's some pretty influential Western propaganda that makes them think China is more harmful to the world outside of China than the West is to the rest of the world outside of the West. Don't you think?

China completely fucks over their citizens with an authoritarian regime. Tbh, a lot of Chinese citizens support them because of huge economic growth. But still, they fuck over their citizens in every other regard and the working class does not benefit from the economic growth much either. So they fuck them over in that regard as well. 

But to me it's pretty clear that China is not worse to the rest of the world compared to West but a looot of people don't see that in the West as evident from reddit which has a vast majority of ordinary people from Anglosphere let alone other Western countries. And even if you don't think China is not less harmful to the rest of the world than the West, these people I'm talking about are completely *unaware* of the harmdoings of the West. Like, you get downvoted for pointing out the imperialist, colonialist, policing of other nations, waging wars because of profit, organising coups, meddling in elections that the West has been doing so much for such a long time. If China was doing that, can you imagine the takes on China? But you can't point these out and say Western countries are evil because those Western states have done a brilliant job making those ordinary people relate themselves to the state and they take it personal when you say ""Western countries are evil"" as if they are the country. Hence they downvote here but ignore, never respond because they want to forget that truth because they relate themselves to the country. That is the primary propaganda every country achieves first. Make people forget they are born into countries out of dumb fucking luck and they are forced to be citizens and oblige everything by birth but make them *identify* with the country instead. 

There's a lot of counter-jerk to that ""American hate"" on reddit as well where people never cease to go ""But I was told America was the worst country ever"" sarcastically on certain threads where it's proper to write that. It's to make feel themselves better about it because they fucking relate to the country and when they can't justify certain actions, they have to go ""well, we have some faults but we are not the worst country tho"".

3128,"&gt;Let me repeat. The only way ""capitalism"" is the inevitable source of a rebuke of ""socialism"" is an acceptance of ideological bipolarism.

Actually their is a bipolarism but it was more about socialism vs every other form of running things that's been documented in history than socialism vs capitalism. I just exemplified capitalism because the user sees that as good. If he or she had seen monarchy or feudalism as good, I'd responded with monarchy and feudalism. Doesn't mean I believe in a political bipolar spectrum of socialism on one side and capitalism on the other as I'm neither of those and neither in between those politically anyway. Politics is not that kind of a line to me, it's a tangled scope.

No. Your strawman here is the offensive one. Not mine. The discussion was not about the horrors of this tragedy or whatever. I was not the one taking the discussion to somewhere else.

&gt; Mr. Cochrane noted that while a large majority of the fires were on land that had already been cleared, many others were detected burning with particular intensity. He said these were likely deforestation fires, not just fires for clearing previously deforested land.

&gt;‚ÄùWhen you slash an area, pile it up, let it dry and then burn it, it burns very intensely, and that‚Äôs also what puts off a lot of that smoke,‚Äù said Mr. Cochrane.

3136,"&gt; Yes!

Hmm. We may just have to disagree on this part -- I think opinion should focus on what the government in power does, as well as general trends of the country. Trump's US are different to Obama's, Gorbachev's USSR was different to Stalin's, and so on.

Responsibility is not hereditary, else we just arrive at a situation where everyone is guilty, which makes the exercise pointless. Just about all countries have some skeleton in their closet.

Though *treatment of history* certainly belongs to ""current responsibilities"".

&gt; They're running a system of concentration camps that is almost unparalleled. There is absolutely no rule of law, no equality before the law and they abduct people from their own semi-autonomous region, spitting on its laws.

From what I have read, China's issues seem based more on local corruption and in some places officials overstepping their authority, rather than a concerted, centralized effort to make peoples' lives miserable ""just because"". Consider motivations and ideology. China isn't some sort of movie supervillain, but rather a massively huge country where a central authority desperately tries to exert and maintain control over all the little pieces it holds.

*Of course* they have rule of law; a country cannot function without. But laws can be abused, in China just as in the US. One example I recall reading was about a guy who wrote something critical on Twitter. Not even some big political manifest, but just an off-hand comment. Usually, police does not bother (according to that documentary), but in that month, the local governor sought re-election and presented himself as tough on crime, instructing police departments to step up arrest quotas. So law enforcement moved to incarcerate everyone they could, including that poor dude.

Two years later, the governor himself got arrested for corruption, and the guy released from labor camp together with some piece of paper about the state being sorry.

Obviously, this isn't a nice story. The guy got treated unfairly, lost two years of his life. The law should have prevented this. I'm just bringing this up for the distinction between China the State abusing the law, and some Chinese officials doing so because the state is flawed.

In principle, this is not much different to Chicago police running a black site prison at Homan Square where people just disappear for days or weeks without trial or access to lawyers as the law would demand -- although I of course agree that you're very likely worse off in China if you *do* manage to get into trouble with the authorities.

&gt; Or the difference between oligarch-owned media and a total state propaganda machine.

In general, I would agree. However, I think it's worth mentioning that current perception of China is, for many people, also still colored by Cold War propaganda too, specifically the (as we now know, thanks to leaked diplomatic cables) flawed reporting on the incidents at Tiananmen Square.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/curign/return_from_the_past/exyiyf6/,akashisenpai,1566652762

3243,"Nope, it actually isn't. Tier 4 living standards are similar all over the world, especially when it comes to resource and energy demand. Most lifestyle differences come from a difference in population density (culture too, but that's mostly a matter of flavour). Densely populated regions will have to adapt in different ways than sparsely populated ones. Where land is fairly abundant, it should be leveraged wisely, where economic resources per unit area is high, that should be leveraged.

The challenges are the same:

1. Housing and city infrastructure wit low to no external power demand, be it from heating, cooling, transit, traffic.
2. Develop cities to meet some of the local food demand.
3. Transition to a more sustainable agriculture, meat &amp; dairy production to bear its own environmental cost.
4. Transforming industry to lower its impact, stopping industry that needs to be stopped (fossil fuel production).
5. Transformation of the energy supply to electricity and hydrogen, including much more advanced load control of the grid.

This gives the coffee quite bitter taste and more caffeine content. Most people don't put sugar or any flavoring syrup in their coffee, maybe some cream or milk, if even that. Part of the reason is that it's common to drink 5 or more cups a day. Coffee is literally everywhere you go. Most of the time the coffee you drink is just basic coffee, as that's what's served everywhere. Oftentimes drinking coffee is an obligation, like when you're visiting someone, or someone offers you coffee at work, school etc. You have no choice but to drink the coffee you're offered, or you're being very impolite. 

But that's just generalizing. Of course you can buy any kind of coffee, and people enjoy sweet coffees too. It's just that the basic everyday coffee is not sweet. If people want sweet coffee they usually just buy cans of flavored coffee from store. You can even buy those by liter. Cheaper than Starbucks, actually tastes good and convenient to drink anywhere. 

Another factor is that there are so many coffee places anyway. Starbucks is just a drop in ocean. Sure, they might specialize in sweet, flavored coffee in large cups.

Now, we could have stayed in of course, it would have been a wonderful choice and saved so much short term trouble...


...except we would have to constantly veto, water down, hold back this integration. Look at the way Britain is seen at the moment, merely by it seeking to avoid vetoing things by securing itself opt outs. It tries to act in the best interest of both sides by allowing the project to go in directions it dosnt want by having an opt out, as opposed to flat out blocking it dead.

We are seen as cocky, arrogant, think we are special, want our cake and eat it, obsessed with thinking we are still the British empire etc etc. All because we do not want to be a closer political union.


Why on earth is this a viable future? Because to me, it absolutely isn‚Äôt. All it would do is constantly increase tension and bad feeling against the UK until a critical boiling point is reached where we may very well be kicked out, or dragged into something our people do not want.

3477,"Im sorry but you are the one who is wrong here.
First off, yes social democracy technically advocates for a reform based transition to socialism&gt;communism, but in reality these days it is most often content in trying to make the most of capitalism by increasing taxes and benefits accordingly.
There is a reason why most communists who believe in this old school way of social democracy call themselves reformists now, since the original meaning of social democrat has become lost in the minds of these social democrats of today, like for example Elizabeth Warren in the US. Who supports social democratic policiies yet is a ""capitalist to the bone""

Secondly, communism supports a revolution sure, but a revolution is not always violent. Usually they are but non violent coups are not unheard of.
Violence is no more a core part of communism than capitalism, look at the philippines it is a capitalist country that persecutes communists actively. And it is not alone in that. Yet I dont think this kind of violence is a core part of capitalism, it just unfortunately happens in the hands of some rulers.

Also, yes the people persecuted by fascists are not usually decided to be killed overnight, it is a more gradual process.
But that does not make my earlier point wrong, they still cannot do anything to the hate they recieve, they are hated because of what they are, not what they do like capitalists by communists.
It is a key difference.

The bourgeoisie also do have time to flee if they wish, since revolutions rarely happen out of the blue, there are signs you can hardly miss. It is not like the proletariat just one day decide to overthrow the bourgeoisie without warning.

Communism also does not condemn everyone to poverty if things are handled properly, just because you think communism only = the authoritarians of the USSR does not mean it is so.

The whole concept of a communist country/state is pretty absurd to be honest, since communism is supposed to be statelesness without a big goverment. The USSR failed in that regard also, making it so nobody owned anything, they operated by the logic that if the state owns it, everybody owns it. Which was obviously not true since the only people who could do anything about the things in the state were the party members.

Communism is merely the ideology that the workers deserve to own their means of production, and that ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs"" is the right way to go.

Also, it is not like I'd like a revolution right now, it is just what I would consider my ideal world.

3596,"No society ever was getting worse with people talking openly...

We are losing that and the fronts are getting more militarized. I have made this throwaway exactly for the purpose of opening up about issues that are getting hushed in society. I am glad that even though we disagree, that we are able to talk about it. If not it will get worse. We are heading to it. I am highly critical of every attempt to censor thoughts, and the normality with which we started to accept it. 

I am glad that Europe lost her brutality (for a short time), and I don't want it back, and I don't want it normalized.

I will argue that religion is a powerful meme that like genes will compete for the struggle for survival. The meme we talk here is very powerful and very dangerous for the meme of European Humanism.

The immigration in the last decade was partly because the meme of Western Culture (= or even closer soulless capitalism as seen in Korea and Japan) undermines the abbility to substain birth rates, however this is dangerous as one can seen by the top baby name being Mohammed in Berlin and Offenbach.

Some of them will turn ""westernized"", but not all and I have seen into the abbyss. The women I loved the most were Turks and Moroccan (so much for the once going for the racism thing), they were all raped and beaten as children. The same stories from female friends from Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and other countries. I despite Islam, as more than religion, as a political movement and psychological indocrination that is against Western values. The same way Nazism is not acceptable, the same way we should see Islam. If you don't believe me google for the help NGOs for muslim girls, for the Zentralrat der Exmuslime.

I believe your assumption these emigrants have to catch up is naive and let to a strong decay of security feeling in all of Western Europe. They do. But Nazism or the influence of the church was not won by aceptance. 

And I want to end this discussion with another question, why are these illegal immigrants here instead of going to safe, rich countries nearby like KSA, UAE or Qatar?

The EU will not accept a solution that damages European Union Customs Union viability (e.g. punches a hole in the customs border); that's not reasonable nor worth it for the EU.  The UK will not accept a solution that segments the country or permanently extends authority over British trade policy to the EU; that's not reasonable nor worth it for the UK.  The RoI will not leave the EU to avoid a border; that's not reasonable nor worth it for the RoI.  Technology will not exist any time in the near term that is sufficient to permit customs checks to be handled without halting vehicles.

As long as those four things are true, there will be a border with checkpoints and vehicles being stopped.  The only thing that can change are the details of the border.

As I've said before, in the long term, Brexit very probably means that eventually the UK will be one country and the EU another.  The RoI will be in the EU and NI will be in the UK.  NI cannot be shared, and the RoI has no ability to change any of the other three limitations above.

3738,"How about you don't quote me from Wehrmacht officers &amp; Communist revisionist conveniency? 

First off, Lenin ordered his Bolsheviks to read works on military theory and strategy, citing that it was too late and bothersome for him to get into it (since the World Proletarian Revolution needed capable military leaders to liberate the world from the capitalist yoke). Among them, Stalin obeyed.                   
Through their revolution, civil war and after, he and others read military theory &amp; strategy, and chewed on the errors and advancements that the Great War had shown, besides what they have experienced in the civil war (ffs, they even invented the concept of ‚Äùwar communism‚Äù).              
What Stalin seemed to have understood is that you do not have a capable army without capable officer corps: the common fatal flaw seen in WWI is that it was dictated by outdated doctrines &amp; out of touch generals. Therefore, the Great War was disastrous because of incapable 'bourgeoisie' generals &amp; marshals, sending the 'proletariat' to their needless deaths.                                
            
The purges are oozing with both Soviet &amp; Nazi revisionism, it's enough to ask: ‚ÄùWho won the war? Which red flag was planted on which side's capital? Who held a celebratory victory parade, muddying the enemy's colours &amp; banners in front of the leadership? Who committed suicide and who lived well after the war? Who colonised half of Europe &amp; imposed their own system as far as their army could reach -- and further beyond?‚Äù            
If the myth had any merit, the USSR would've crumbled just as Hitler thought in a couple of weeks or months. Well, wouldn't you know, looks like it didn't.                   
The next good question is, why would the Soviets downplay their officers' capability, despite them celebrating the ‚Äùgreat patriotic war‚Äù (and the inherent militarism) instead of treating it as a mourning remembrance; since in today's Russia they celebrate WWII militarism like it's a national sacrosanctity? 

As for Hitler, you're right; he had to ‚Äùplay General‚Äù at times because he didn't decapitated his officer corps filled with old careerist grumpy veterans, that looked down on ‚Äùthe Corporal‚Äù, defying the leadership.                       
In an ironic twist turn of events, the SA leader Rohm would ultimately prove correct when he said trusting the old Prussian guard would be a mistake &amp; undermine the regime; which eventually would cost him his life in the only purge the Nazis ever did.                  
And so it turned out: Hitler ended up spending his last days in his bunker contemplating suicide, losing his mind, swearing &amp; yelling that his senior officers were always useless throughout the war, whereas the Soviet marshals &amp; officers were energetic to prove themselves in front of Stalin which one of them could invade as much of Europe and which one would capture Berlin first.            
Who won the Eastern front: the ‚Äùvirtuous‚Äù Prussian geriatric officer corps *or* the decapitated Red Army that fought back from the jaws of seeming defeat?         
Whatever Stalin did to reform his army officer corps would eventually work since they would win the war for him, turn Eastern Europe into a hellhole, and prolong the Communist ideology.

3750,"&gt; Frankly speaking, they are not good at minorizing languages in Spain, actually they're protecting, reviving and officializing Galician, Valencian-Catalan and Basque by means of immersion programs at school and all kind of promotion.

With ""they"" I assume you mean the Galicians, Catalans, Valencians and Basques. Yes, all those people officialized their languages and made sure to protect their languages and promote them.

&gt; If you want to see languages dying, cross the French border and check situation out. You'll notice the Frenchies have trully mastered the art of making languages die.

I perfectly know how's the situation in France, since Catalan is also spoken there and I've been there multiple times. But this is not a competition about who's worse, ""the Frenchs or the Spaniards"". Both countries have ""mastered the art of making languages die"" and have tried to eliminate any cultural differences. In fact, if you know some history, you must know that for centuries the Spanish Kingdom saw France as an example in these regard, and applied similar policies when persecuting languages. Both countries have been terrible examples in this regard. As opposed to other countries that have welcomed linguistic differences, like Switzerland.

3756,"&gt; I can say, beyond a doubt, that China is an Authoritarian, Capitalist country.

Much like how Libertarians/Republicans use ""Communist"", you seem to be using the word ""Capitalist"" as a tribalistic formulation, rather than an economic descriptive. All nations are mixed economies. There has never been any state with 100% pure capitalism nor 100% pure communism. And China has more state intervention than even most european nations, including direct state ownership of vast economic enterprises. So it remains, let me call it, ""socialist-ish"". Also, while it is indisputably authoritarian, it is overwhelmingly less so than it was prior to the Deng reformation. China was vastly more authoritarian when it was more communist.

Further, the horseshoe theory hasn't been ""debunked"" so much as it has been angrily railed at.  To the vast majority of people however, all philosophies which depend on identifying external enemies, promoting ideology over compassion (usually after conflating the two), the assertion that members are following a higher morality or power, black and white thinking, and other aspects of cult-like control, are unmistakable. Be it various communist manifestos, atlas shrugged, or the screeds of dozens of theocratic cults, the similarities are overwhelmingly obvious to anyone not in them. Some people like to live in simple, tribalistic, worlds, where morality is situational depending on whether a member of the tribe does it or someone else does. 

Indeed, the only ""flaw"" the horseshoe theory has is the implicit idea that there are merely two ends to the horseshoe, when authoritarians come in virtually infinite flavors, that mostly can be categorized into: religious, economic, racist, and cultural.  ""Screw compromise, if I don't get 100% of what I want, I'll kill you,"" is perhaps the original political philosophy, and it means absolutely nothing to those suffering under the boots of these kinds of people what their particular excuse is. They're all one and the same.

&gt; The rise of automation deems the end of capitalism as we know it

Yeah, these kinds of grand pronouncements mean nothing. There will always be some forms of free trade and always be some form of government intervention on behalf of society. So neither capitalism nor socialism will ever go away. Nor is automation new. The industrial revolution was all about the disruption of industries. Combined with massive overpopulation, it set the scene for The Road to Wigan Pier that you quoted.

Further, the real underlying issue is sexual selection. In humans, males prove their worth by displaying the economic capability. Up until very recently this was a very practical consideration for how tribes-women decided who they would agree to marry. It's not selective to have a husband who can't provide enough to keep your baby from starving. The trouble is, just like with peacocks, showing economic superiority is now in a feedback loop. No matter how rich a man is compared to what men had even a hundred years ago, he's not being judged on an absolute basis, but relative to all other males right now. This is why men are driven to buy status symbols based off of environmental destruction: diamonds, cars, ""bling"". It's why the creepiness of ""Fifty Shades"", in which the sequels descended into outright rape (but it's ""okay"" because it's a billionaire), are written by women, for women. And it's the fatal flaw in thinking UBI will make anyone happy. Sure, if we had it, people could be fed. But ""being on the dole"" won't get most men a girlfriend.

Most police stations in Germany don't share a ""wanted people"" list anymore. You can find one still for Berlin. Take a look at it:

3796,"&gt; In short words: the main point of your post is lie. You just can't describe Spanish as a foreign language in Catalonia. Catalans have been understanding, speaking and writing Spanish for centuries.

I have better things to do than lying. So I don't know what's your point here. 

Latin was the main language spoken in Catalonia until Old Catalan appeared in the 10th century. Then Catalan begun to replace Latin, as the other languages in Europe did during this period. At the [Principality of Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Catalonia) (12th century ‚Äì 18th century), the main language of the population was Catalan only. That was the language used by the population, the traditions, laws and legislation ([Catalan constitutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_constitutions), publications, Catalan literature... etcera. Everything was in Catalan only. Spanish was not a language present in the Catalan society. It was as a foreign language just as Basque or French or Italian. Very few people in Catalonia could understand Spanish or French. Only few higher class members of society could understand other languages besides Catalan.

It's extensively documented when and how Spanish was introduced in Catalonia. After the 18th century Spain's Nueva Planta decrees, Catalonia lost its self-government. And Spain begun to impose Spanish language only policies, and repressing other languages. There lots of examples of these policies from the 18th century to the 19th century. But all those attempts weren't very successful, until the 20th century ones. When Spanish finally begun to be introduced in Catalonia and Catalans became no longer monolingual Catalan-speakers.

&gt; For instance, during the [Spanish Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Golden_Age), some of the most important printers where located in Barcelona.

I don't know why you send me this link as a source. The word ""printer"" doesn't appear anywhere.

3815,"&gt;18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions

You literally just proved that it was a stop gap with this figure though? Your solution doesn't even address the whole 18%, and does nothing to reduce the other *82%* of green house emissions (a lot of which are far more harmful overall than the methane emissions from the meat industry. Shipping transport releases toxic heavy metals as well as GHGs)

&gt;You 3rd point just repeats what I said, we grow enough food for over 10 billion people but, as allready mentioned, up to 70% is fed to the animals.

This is not what I said at all? You really should read more about food waste in modern society. With NO CHANGES to the types of food we consume, we can currently feed everyone. The issue is that the food is being distributed and utilised adequately to do so. Huge percentages of food are completely wasted. Nothing about changing our diet would fix this problem, because the only thing changing our diet does is give us access to more food, which we already have enough of. What portion of food is fed to animals is completely irrelevant

&gt;there would be no need for the transportation.

Um. Yes there would. Like 90% of the population lives in places that cannot support their diets. That's why the global specialisation of the food industry even started in the first place. Like, do you not think people wouldn't just grow beef closer to them and save on transport costs if it were viable?

You're really arguing from a place of huge ignorance. Please do you research. As I said, everyone going meat free would be absolutely a good thing. Hitting the 12% or so of GHGs it would affect is still awesome. But we need to reduce more pollution than just GHGs (which is a pretty low threat form of pollution right now in comparison to plastic and heavy metal pollution in the oceans which is already leading to deaths on land as well as wiping out millions of sea lives)",,/r/europe/comments/cuds9x/finland_urges_eu_to_consider_banning_brazilian/exvlqo3/,MacTireCnamh,1566601784

Some myths about Switzerland when it comes to gun laws and gun ownership:

* Lowest crime rates in the world

Not true at all. We are currently in the top 10 of the lowest rates, we can't possibly have the lowest crime rates when there are countries like Monaco that rarely have any crime. 2014 was one of the years with the lowest homicide rates, but I predict that this year will be higher, since there was a mass murder early this year.

* Everyone walks around with a rifle for safety

No. If you do this without a clear and lawful purpose, you will be thrown in jail.

* Everyone is required to own guns

Not true. Only militia soldiers get a gun when they start, but they can choose to keep it at home or not. As for everyone else, you have to follow the rules in order to buy a gun.

* Ammo is not allowed

Ammo is allowed, the only ammo that is not allowed to be purchased and stored at home is the issued ammo called GP90 because it's subsidized and because the army decided to stop giving it for free to the conscripts. You can buy everything else (as long as it's not explosive or hollow point which can only be used by hunters) and store it at home.

* There is no gun control

As you can see, there is gun control.

* There are extremely strict gun laws.

As you can see, those are not extremely strict gun laws.

* The police searches your home when you own guns.

Only if you own fully automatic guns, and they do it once or twice a year while first announcing it.

* We have the lowest crime rate because people have to own guns

See the first point. While we have low crime rates, it's certainly not because of gun ownership. Simplifying it so much is just not sensible. We have low crime because of stuff like this:

&gt;$$$$$$$$  
&gt;  
&gt;Low unemployment  
&gt;  
&gt;Low inequality  
&gt;  
&gt;Good education  
&gt;  
&gt;Social programs that help people

I noticed that some mod added the title **misleading** to my post. It's not misleading, it's exactly how you get a gun as a civilian.

A summary of Mohammad's wives is available here:

https://wikiislam.net/wiki/List_of_Muhammads_Wives_and_Concubines

I was specifically referring to Rayhana bint Zayd ibn Amr:

*Her first husband was one of the 600-900 Qurayza men whom Muhammad beheaded in April 627. He enslaved all the women and selected Rayhana for himself because she was the most beautiful. When she refused to marry him, he kept her as a concubine instead. She died shortly before Muhammad in 632.*

But he actually did this more than once, with Safiya bint Huyai too:

*When the Muslims invaded and conquered Khaybar, the fighting men were killed and Safiyah was taken captive (along with the rest of the women and children) and allotted as booty to Dihya Al-Kalbi, a Muslim.[1] Kinana was tortured and executed by the Muslims in order to discover the hiding places of treasure,[2][3][4] and one source relates that he and Safiyah had been married only one day.[5] She was so beautiful, that the Muslims began praising her in the presence of Muhammad[6], and so the prophet commanded that Dihya be brought before him along with Safiyah. Upon seeing her, Muhammad said, ""Take any slave girl other than her from the captives""[7] and he selected her for himself.[8] The Muslims left Khaibar to return to Medina and on the way they stopped at a place called Sidd-as-Sahba; it was at this time Safiyah became clean from her menses.[9] The ""marriage banquet"" consisted of haris (a kind of dish) served on a small leather sheet and a gathering of those who were conveniently nearby.[10] Another narrator describes the banquet in this way: ""...there was neither meat nor bread in that banquet, but the Prophet ordered Bilal to spread the leather mats on which dates, dried yogurt and butter were put.""[11] Muhammad stayed three nights there and consummated his marriage with Safiyah.[12] Despite this banquet, the Muslims were still not sure whether she would be considered a wife or a right hand possession until Muhammad set off and forced her to wear a veil as she rode behind him on his camel.[13] He considered her manumission to be an adequate mahr (dowry).[14]*

3982,"&gt;Out of curiosity I plotted a graph of how many percent all parties other than the biggest two got in past elections. 

Interesting, thanks for this. Im curious if it would look much different with distribution of seats instead of actual votes.

&gt; Turns out it's been worse and it will actually be better compared to this year's euro elections. 

Sure its been worse, but those were unusual times in the 90s. Notice that this year predictions will bring us back to the situation roughly around 2007 when PiS and PO grew the most. Now, if we take into consideration a couple more factors, Im pretty pessimistic.

* Our system favors the largest parties which we have 2. PiS last election got \~37.5% votes but got &gt;50% seats. 
* Other than those 2, there are only a couple parties that even have a chance of getting in. 3rd position is pretty safe with the Left \~11%, but the 4th and 5th (K'15+PSL and Konfederacja) are close to the threshold of 5%. If they will pass it is uncertain (very dependent on turnout, which most likely will be high, which is bad for them. Not to even mention Konfederacja already was polling good but failed at the EU elections and K'15 joining PSL is very controversial. If they dont get in we have 3 parties with the winner getting even more seats.
* The political atmosphere has been getting more and more polarized since 2005, which has only caused more tribalism and the strengthening of ""wasted vote"" mentality. 
* Up until 2015 we more or less had the same old faces in parliament, people were sick of it. There was a mini ""revolution"" of anti-system thinking . Out of no where Pawel Kukiz (the face of it) got over 20% in presidential elections. Half a year later his support fell to about \~9% in parliamentary elections. Unfortunately for his movement, PiS won majority and K'15 wasnt needed, they became irrelevant and werent able to achieve anything in parliament (I think the whole political situation would look drastically different now, if PiS had to form a coalition with them to get majority votes). Because of this, they lost even more support. The whole anti-system movement is more or less dead now. The other new party that got elected in 2015 is Nowoczesna which turned out to be a complete failure. So generally speaking, electing new people/parties has done nothing which sadly only strengthened the ""wasted vote"" mentality.
* Parties are grouping up either to be able to challenge PiS (KO - the wide anti PiS coalition) or just to have a chance of passing the threshold (all of the left, K'15 with PSL).",Poland,/r/europe/comments/cue2tg/poland_2019_parliamentary_elections_poll/exv8yx3/,Polish_Panda,1566594865

4062,"Colourblind ""theory"" (lol) is literally PC culture gone mad. It's privileged Americans who happen to be white pretending they can simply ignore the structural racism built into their society. It solved *nothing* except making it socially unacceptable to say the N word on the record or in front of enough black people that it couldn't be ignored. Baby steps, I guess.

The Democrats are centrist neoliberals who count right wingers among their ranks. They aren't socialists and they aren't commies. In the **1970's** (that's **after** the 1964 civil rights act, FYI), Joe Biden, a Democrat, was working with right wing segregationists to ensure white schools stayed white. So much for colourblind ""theory"" (lol) and racial integration.

2. I simply know more than you. You should either read the links I provided, or give up.

I love Shushi too, but the rest of their cuisine didn't realy spread sadly.

Like which kind of tech ? 
Aeronautique ? Airbus (European) is in the Top3 with Boeing and Lockhead building helicopter (Marseille France), plane (Bigest usine in Toulouse France), satelites (Toulouse France), rockets (Ariane is mostly a French project to reduce the cost of our nuclear missiles) ...

Dassault build Rafale by themself while Japan are building licensed F16 and buy F35 from the USA.

OVH is one of the biggest server hosting compagny in the world.

Game ? Ever heard of Ubisoft (not as great of Japan on the subject but still great).

Some of us believe in the 'Academia' as a safer way to do research. It's more low key and there's less interest and dependency on the market (which is at times too volatile).

Going to private companies may get you more funding though, which ultimately is what the most ambitious researchers need for their projects. Salary also increases, which is always a plus, but for top tier research what you are really looking for is money for your project, and the private market, usually through militarized and private companies, pays a lot more.

Europe, however, has a problem. I'm not trying to defend the American system by the way, I'm just pointing out some facts. 

There is less money overall in the research market going around since our economies arent as dynamic. The lack of entrepreneurship culture also scares away potential start ups, as well as blocking a lot of money from possible financial gains, which is the backbone of the american research market. I'm not sure myself on how europe can counter that. The financial market can be dangerous when let go without restraints, so I dont think we want to go the yankee way about it, but we definitely need an injection to compete for top tier employees.

The 11 million number is real, and i did my research tyvm. The reason why i dont want to argue about such numbers is because all the sources are diffrent so you wont get anywhere witho  arguing about it. I had no interest in getting the non combatants deaths for the soviet union but famine and work camps were a large majority and you can reduce the number down too 36 million soviets if you dont want to include ww2 combatants. 

Secondly the main point of communisim is equal distrubution of wealth between people, not fixing poverty or healthcare. Such distrubution requires incredible ammount of mangagment effort and therefore communisim cant work untill in the future. Communisim also cant work with the precence of human leadership, as people and politics can never be trusted. 

How would i fix poverty you ask? For a start i would cut millitary budgets and build housing for people and give them enough subsidies just for necessities and create a goverment funded education, after graduation its their choise weather or not they stay poor. Capitalisim isint a single reason for poverty.

And yet you claimed nobody knew...

&gt; The Nazis are pretty much the reason we condemn it all as strongly as we do today.

They indeed are, but mostly because they took it ""too far"" and ended up losing the war. Even with that: [Racial segregation laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws) in the US remained in effect for decades after the Nazis were defeated. 

If the condemnation was as swift as widespread as you make it out to be, that should never have been the case. But in reality, it very much is the case and one of the reasons why beliefs in biologically distinct human races are prevalent to among US medical practitioners [to this day](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/racial-differences-doctors.html).

&gt; Social Darwinism and even a degree of racist pseudoscience was still fairly mainstream.

In many countries, it still **is** fairly mainstream to this day.

Yet here's was this guy who wrote a whole book about how he blames the Jews for everything and explaining what he's gonna do about it, he's really interested in eugenics and racial purity ideals popularized by the KKK and other US-based white supremacists, largely drawing on [century-old religious resentments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_Christianity#Nazi_antisemitism).

You are absolutly right. Capitalsim is driven by profit maximization. You can only create profit by understanding what the needs of other people are. 

Let me rephrase: To profit, you need to provide the needs and wants of other people. This is an extremly powerful tool. It spurs innovation. It creates a better life for the masses. 

Yes, capitalism has huge flaws. Yet, capitalism is necessary for a free scociety. It needs to be implemented at the BASE of every economy.

Capitalsim doesn't suffice. We have to work on it, have to understand it and correct it. Thats why i study economics. 

The destruction of our environment is one of capitlisms immense flaws. We have to find a solution that is sustainable. Voting, protests and consumer choices are all tools provided by a free scociety, which will sway capitalism to a more sustainable future.

4543,"&gt; Many countries already have progressive taxation and estate taxes and they're not communist states as far as I know. 

You missed my point completely. The point is that these policies could easily be used to achieve the necessary wealth equity that communism espouses. 

&gt; What you propose is some really radical versions which basically lead to asset confiscation.

I'm not a communist, so I am really not proposing anything, to be clear ;)

&gt; The fact that you don't mind it means nothing.

Most people do not mind taxes - or at least do not oppose them enough to make a revolution against them. Hence this is authoritarianism people support.

&gt; There will be a lot of people who won't agree with communists and intellectuals will be one group of such people. And the point is you'd have to create an authoritarian state to opress all people who don't agree with communists.

But - why? If capitalism as a system allows communists and adherents to other social or economic systems to speak out - why wouldn't a non-authoritarian communistic system? In any case - you do realize there are intellectuals who agree with socialism, just like there are intellectuals who agree with capitalism? Intellectualism does not mean ''one who does not support communism''. 

&gt; The point was under capitalism communists have a lot more to say than capitalists would have under communism.

No, your point was that ''capitalism'' (even though capitalism has nothing to do with democracy'') allows communists to participate in the democratic process. You've not convinced me that a communistic system with democratic principles would inherently repress capitalistic-minded people from speaking out and organizing political parties. And, to be clear - under capitalism communists have just as little say as capitalists would under communism - the issue is that capitalism is just economic theory, while communism is more than that, which already means it is hard to compare one to the other.",Damn dirty sexy Balts..,/r/europe/comments/cu9505/on_this_day_80_years_ago_germany_and_the_ussr/exso4bc/,LatvianLion,1566551303

Fascist Nationalism was needed to unite Italy, which was split into multiple states since the fall or Roman Empire. Yet Fascists didn't care much who exactly lives in Italy: Jews were welcome, for example, and Italy opposed Germany in their treatment of Jews. Italian notion of race was of traditions and culture and Mussolini specifically rejected biological differences. Again, this was a tool of unification of Italy, not oppression of minorities.

Everything else was quite left wing: policies, politics, etc. Not communist far left, but definitely to the left of centre. Fascism promoted a corporatist economic system, meaning that employer and employee form a syndicate to work together for the glory of the nation. Those who were sabotaging this system for their personal gains were punished.

Mussolini also supported Soviet Russia and was against Hitler and Nazis for the most time.

The  release of previously secret reports from the Soviet archives in the  1990's indicate that the victims of repression in the Stalin era were  about 9 million persons. Some historians claim that the death toll was  around 20 million based on their own demographic analysis and from dated  information published before the release of the reports from the Soviet  archives American historian Richard Pipes noted: ""Censuses revealed  that between 1932 and 1939‚Äîthat is, after collectivization but before  World War II‚Äîthe population decreased by 9 to 10 million people. In his  most recent edition of The Great Terror (2007), Conquest states that  while exact numbers may never be known with complete certainty, at least  15 million people were killed ""by the whole range of Soviet regime's  terrors""

Hitler and the Nazi regime were  also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians  and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians  died as a result of military action in the European theatre.

(The Amazon spreads across Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and parts of other countries.) Though activity appears to be above average in the states of Amazonas and Rond√¥nia, it has so far appeared below average in Mato Grosso and Par√°, according to estimates from the Global Fire Emissions Database, a research project that compiles and analyzes NASA data.

4886,"&gt;I always thought his veto was because of anti-American sentiment, rather than animosity towards the UK.

And you were right.

That's the reason he withdrew France from the integrated command of NATO, and wildly strengthened the development of domestic rocket, nuclear, and military equipment programs initially undertaken by the [4th Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Fourth_Republic). And it's worth reminding that the US originally planned to split and occupy France as they did with Germany, and De Gaulle never forgot. 

So in the end, it wasn't a rejection of the UK, neither was it animosity toward the Brits. It wasn't even an ""anti-American sentiment"" strictly speaking. De Gaulle was only concerned with securing the complete independence of France in a world increasingly dominated by the US and the USSR. He was more *pro-France* than *anti-something*. As a result, while France categorically remained a capitalist pro-West country and a NATO member, it was somewhat neutral (albeit only to an extent) in the geopolitical feud opposing the two superpowers.

People often bring him up as a visionary when talks arises regarding the UK undermining European integration, but as you correctly pointed out, he only opposed the application of the UK to the EEC because he perceived it as a US proxy. It had little to do with the UK itself. Similarly, he opposed (with the help of the French communist party, interestingly enough) the creation of the [EDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_establishing_the_European_Defence_Community) (in which the UK wasn't involved) in fear that it would encroach upon French sovereignty.

&amp;nbsp;

I found this on a wikipedia article, which is perfectly describing his mindset regarding French independence:

&gt;The decision to arm France with nuclear weapons was made in 1954 by the administration of Pierre Mend√®s-France under the Fourth Republic. President Charles de Gaulle, upon his return to power in 1958, solidified the initial vision into the well-defined concept of a fully independent *Force de Frappe* capable of protecting France from a Soviet or other foreign attack, independent of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which President de Gaulle considered to be dominated by the United States to an unacceptable degree. In particular, France was concerned that in the event of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe, the US‚Äîalready bogged down in the War in Vietnam and afraid of Soviet retaliation against the United States proper‚Äîwould not come to the aid of its Allies in Western Europe. According to de Gaulle, France should never trust its defense and therefore its very existence to a foreign and thus unreliable protector.

&gt;The strategic concept behind the *Force de Frappe* is one of countervalue, i.e., the capacity to inflict so much damage on a potential (and more powerful) adversary's population that the potential adversary will be deterred from attacking no matter how much destruction they themselves are capable of inflicting (see Mutual Assured Destruction). This principle is usually referred to in French political debate as *dissuasion du faible au fort* (Weak-to-strong deterrence) and was summarized in a statement attributed to President de Gaulle himself:

&gt;*""Within ten years, we shall have the means to kill 80 million Russians. I truly believe that one does not light-heartedly attack people who are able to kill 80 million Russians, even if one can kill 800 million French, that is if there were 800 million French.*""

&gt;General Pierre Marie Gallois said ""*Making the most pessimistic assumptions, the French nuclear bombers could destroy ten Russian cities; and France is not a prize worthy of ten Russian cities.*""

&gt;In his book *La paix nucl√©aire* (1975), French Navy Admiral Marc de Joybert explained deterrence as:

&gt;*""Sir, I have no quarrel with you, but I warn you in advance and with all possible clarity that if you invade me, I shall answer at the only credible level for my scale, which is the nuclear level. Whatever your defenses, you shan't prevent at least some of my missiles from reaching your home and causing the devastation that you are familiar with. So, renounce your endeavour and let us remain good friends.""*

Additionally, things like [Mers-el-K√©bir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Mers-el-K%C3%A9bir), while an understandable action, were still in memories and didn't help convincing the French that they could faithfully and blindly rely on their allies.

&amp;nbsp;

Either way, De Gaulle was both a vehement patriot and the product of a time long passed, when France was a global dominant power. 

As such, while a lot of his decisions were (consciously or unconsciously) sensible and beneficial for France (and by extension, for Europe), he lacked a realistic vision regarding the place and weight of France in an increasingly global world, with a redefined balance of military and economic power. It's no accident that European integration grew that much over time, it's just the course of history and a matter of survival for European societies and economies. But De Gaulle failed to foresee that evolution.

No, increasing wages is easier than decreasing wages. Declining wages is something that largely doesn't exist - and if it exists chances are you're in deep shit (i.e. deflation).

If everyone follows the German example the Eurozone is in deep shit. We need higher inflation and Germany is primarily at fault for this situation and should increase its wages. I love how people in Germany complain about low interests and the possibilities of negative interests but can't make this simple connection.

4967,"Of course I dont think that there are zero racists who voted to leave. Of course there is a percentage of people who voted to leave because they hate foreigners, where did I suggest that racists do not exist? I'm pretty sure every EU member state has some percentage of its population that could be defined as racist. So no, I am not deluded. Why have you even brought it up if you admit in your last statement: ""obviously not every leave voter"".

I believe that the majority of leave voters did not vote leave because of a hatred of other racial groups.

Are you claiming that most leave voters were racist and therefore voting for racist reasons? It would seem that if this is the case, then their opinions about EU membership should be disregarded because we should not encourage people to make decisions based on racial prejudice, we know the visceral effects of what can happen when people base their decisions and politics on racial prejudice, we learned this during WW2. Think of how powerful this propaganda could be if we can paint all (or a majority) of leave voters as racist. By doing this we can diminish their legitimacy. 
All human beings use symbolism to form their image of the world and its inhabitants because the world is complex and difficult to fully understand, none of us will ever fully understand the complex workings of the world, the relationships between leaders and countries and politics of every nation, the motivations of every group and ideology etc etc. so we use symbols in our mind to represent things. For example, when we think of 9/11 most people think terrorists, bush, bin laden, middle east, arabs, muslims, planes, death, sadness etc. and they have a story in their heads that says muslims bad, middle east bad, terrorists bad. Im not diminishing peoples intelligence, this is absolutely how people think, maybe you think at a higher level than this but this is genuinely how most people think most of the time in order to quickly navigate the world. I think you are doing this in this scenario, it is completely natural, we all do this, you have heard many stories of propaganda that highlight every incidence of racism out of the 15 million or so? people who voted leave and because this is all the media companies have allowed you to see, this forms the basis of your opinion of all leave voters. Reading mainstream news articles and news reports on the TV will naturally give you a negative opinion on leave voters because the establishment does not want to leave the EU and wants to diminish the legitimacy of leave voters by drawing as many parralels between leave voters and racists, I have even seen comparisons drawn between nazism and leave voters. Putting these 'symbols' together in peoples minds will absolutely diminish leave voters legitimacy, this is a form of propaganda, it is a form of lying and it is wrong.
David Cameron was expecting the calling of this referendum, and the expected 'remain' result, to stem the outward flow of conservative voters who were moving to the UKIP party. Brexit was never supposed to happen, no forethought was put into what would be done if leave won. David Cameron subsequently resigned. 
Dont believe everything you read on the internet or hear on the Television, especially the latter. Things are not always as they seem, be skeptical of everything you hear. I know how difficult it is but we all have to be vigilant. Im pretty sure you wont try to research the actual reasons why just over half of britain wants to leave the EU, because frankly, who cares right? We all have lives to get on with, bills to pay, kids to feed. But at least in future, be vigilant of the fact that people are constantly knowingly lying to you on a massive scale in the media, politicians etc. and they do so convincingly and just because many people believe the same story, does not mean that it is the truth.",,/r/europe/comments/ct3fqg/dutch_organize_a_goodbye_party_on_brexit_eve_the/exru4ci/,Fy12qwerty,1566524181

You read it somewhere, but it's not true. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Hungary#2016

It clearly says 98,3% are Hungarians. Hungary is basically an ethno-state.

Please, tell me, what seat in the Hungarian parliement do Romanians have? Or Slovaks? In Romania even newly formed minorities have a seat guaranteed in the parliement, such as the Italian community. That's the difference between you and us, we actually make sure even the smallest minority is represented in the government. 

&gt;It's illegal to put any other national flag then Romanian on public institutions in every case.

It's not, as long as it is next to the Romanian one. 

&gt;Even on the village hall writes ""Casa satului"" first then under it the Hungarian translation, which is the favourite topic of the famous anti-Hungarian called Dan TanasƒÉ when it comes to silly accusations.

Wow, you have ONE bilingual plaque in the whole country and you're so proud of it. You make me laugh. My city has some plaques in Romanian, German, Hungarian and Serbian since all 4 communities live here. So, what you said it's not a big deal at all. 

&gt;If there would be doctors from Nigeria you could speak with them in their language, it doesn't mean anything. In many other institutions aren't any Hungarian representation.

I want to know exactly what is this insitution that has no person who speaks Hungarian and has more than 20% Hungarians? 

&gt;Tell me another minority which can be integrated more easily, please. Germans? Yeah, i'm sure they can, because they almost extinct after 100 years of the Marea Unire. How many are left from them? Few thousands? You can be proud of 

Yeah, Germans. They aren't ""extinct"", the Germans in all of Eastern Europe were sent back to Germany once Eastern Europe came under communist rule. Poland literally exiled them, while we made a deal with Germany and many of them didn't leave too. Funny enough, the Germans voted to unite with Romania back in 1918, not with you :P Anyways, you can see Hungarians cause troubles in Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine, all over the place.

5188,"Oh, it's not even a joke.

Finns buy some 80 million litres of alcoholic beverages from Estonia annually. This means hundreds of millions of euros worth of booze.

Big portion of these drinks is mild beverages such as beer but includes also harder stuff up to 80%. I guess it's often like 100-150 cans of beer/cider/lonkero and some 10 bottles of spirits. Silly thing is, notable portion of the milder stuff is made in Finland but Finns buy it from Estonia because of lower tax rate.

What happened lately is that in 2017 Estonia raised its alcohol tax. This made a notable portion of Finnish alcohol tourists to go to Latvia instead. Yeah, it makes such a big difference if you're a semi-alcoholic who buys his annual dose at once.

This summer Estonia was forced to lower its alcohol tax because of Latvia. It's not only about Finns. I believe Estonia has its own alcoholics who go to Latvia for shopping. Anyways, Latvia followed suit within few days and lowered their alcohol tax rate because they calculated the impact to their economy would be almost 100 million euros a year.

So if going to Latvia, Lithuania or Poland from Finland is made easier and especially cheaper than ferry and own car / bus rides you bet Finns will go where the booze is cheapest.",,/r/europe/comments/ctwd6o/58bn_highspeed_rail_project_rail_baltica_as_a/exqy5fd/,m_hakkinen,1566508659

5217,"&gt; ""provide a clear signal that the EU cares"" about the fact ""insects are being decimated at an alarming rate.""

More like a clear signal that the EU doesn't really care about the death of wild bees. Bees aren't dying, wild bees are. Beekeeping currently undergoes a massive hype because people think they're helping ""the bees"" if they become beekeepers. 

If domestic bees compete with wild bees for a food source that can't provide enough food for both, the domestic bees usually win.

There's even research that suggest that domestic bees, especially when they are kept by inexperienced beekeepers, can spread diseases to wild bees. And while the beekeeper can revive an infected hive, an infection is basically a death sentence for a wild hive. 


&gt; However, no progress has been made since 2013 on securing EU countries' agreement on a set of stricter rules for the authorization of bee-harming pesticides, known as the Bee Guidance Document.

But... It was all a hoax. 3 years of lies. 3 years of accusations. All on a hoax. They all bought it, too. Well, many did. None of it turned out to be true. 

Yet, people STILL believe these same media people. The same people who lied to them day in, and day out, for 3 years, and they STILL lap it up like thirsty dogs. 

Never in my life did I ever think I would witness such an operation in propaganda. It's actually been incredible to watch, and I can finally see, and understand, how so many people can be mislead, lied to, and deceived, and never once stop to question what is true.

They didn't ditch it, they made an alliance so that they could do the things that each side wanted to do. The independentists like Talamoni still want independence, but they are happy to work with autonomists on things they both agree upon, like the officiality of the Corsican language.

These concerns were addressed since the mid 00's and culminated in the [Munich speech of Vladimir Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_speech_of_Vladimir_Putin)in 2007. 

The plan to put missiles in Poland and Romania were announced only in 2009. Putin's Munich speech was also largely in response for US support for independent Kosovo, but the speech is basically just a template which you can nowadays put in context with every crisis Russia finds itself in.

5618,"&gt;however Russian allegations of these above mentioned things have only come recently

No, Russian allegations started in 2007, our politicians addressed the issue with the NATO plans of deploying universal launching systems in Poland and Romania.

Therefore can carry canisters with any missiles, including [Tomahawks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomahawk_(missile)), which deployment on the ground would be in violation of the treaty.

&gt; US side has been accusing Russia of the violations ever since Obama administration

5625,"&gt; No, that's common practice: jobs, marriages, house ownership, allianes etc. all are assumed to last indefinitely unless they are canceled. Which is definitely possible but not expected.

Yes but they are written in contracts, at least in established nations. It's called contract law. Jobs (should) have contracts, marriages do too, house ownership does, as do mortgages (loans secured against homes.)

It's not common practise to lend money to a customer and not have a signed contract, nor to lease a property without a tenancy agreement.

&gt; Ex-members also get to keep the lasting results of benefits they received while members, for example infrastructure developed with EU support.

Is this any different from the EU getting to keep membership money and do with it as it pleases? If the EU buys a building with membership money, it gets to keep it after they leave. How is your argument different?

&gt; In fact, is as if the ex cosigned the mortgage (the eu budget), wants half of the house (the benefit of the EU projects accrued during membership), but refuses to keep paying the mortgage (pension liabilities and other costs)

Ok so co-signed a mortgage, wants half the house on sale, after sale there is no mortgage to pay as the mortgage has been settled. I'm not sure what the point is here? If you were to keep paying after you had your half, you'd want more later on, as you've continued to pay. You don't get half the property sale value, you get half the equity.

&gt; You don't like what it illustrates. I find it a very apt comparison :)

Actually it was accurate. But here is the thing, if a party of four decide to eat and one leaves, there is no legal approach to getting that party to pay their ""fair share."" In that case, all the other three can do is know not to deal with that person again, which is a fair and proportional response. But let's be clear, there is no contract in this scenario forcing the leaving party to pay. Is there? (FYI, ""Gentlemen's agreements"" do not stand up in courts of law.)

&gt; Why would the default be that states don't honor prior commitments?

The default is to honour contractual obligations. You're from the Netherlands, you're not from an Eastern European country that's only 30 years out of the USSR. You should know this. Stop trying to play the fool.

&gt; The liabilities get split up proportionally between ex-members for the time they enjoyed the services of those people.
&gt; Really, otherwise that would be a very easy way to get out of pension and other liabilities for states and especially for companies.

So if the EU fails, the liabilities go to the ex-members? Could you please show me a citation for that?",Great Britain,/r/europe/comments/ctk99a/france_says_nodeal_is_most_likely_outcome_but_uk/exo9m4l/,disassemblemain,1566472508

At several points in his tenure, he has irritated officials in Washington and other allied capitals by appearing not to support Western initiatives fully. They accused him of a quasi-neutralism that came to be known as Genscherism.
&gt; 
&gt; Fundamental to Genscherism was said to be the belief that Germany could play a role as a bridge between East and West without losing its status as a reliable NATO ally. Mr. Genscher is a strong advocate of negotiated settlements to international problems, and critics say he occasionally takes that credo too far.
&gt; 
&gt; Last year, after the United Nations endorsed military action against Iraq, Mr. Genscher again provoked Western criticism by supporting several unsuccessful peace initiatives.

I don't think it's fair to call that a coup. E.g. the French revolution is an ""easy"" example. But I halfway agree with you, in that a lot of revolutions ends up with chains of coups even if they start out with popular support, and it is a big challenge that flows naturally from the fact that the most radical elements of a revolutionary uprising will tend to be disappointed by how limited change the moderate elements wants, and will tend to be prepared to dig in.

This is incidentally in my view one of the reasons by Leninist party theory is so incredibly dangerous - it sets a revolutionary movement up to be insular, paranoid and trained to ignore outsiders who they'll write off as counter-revolutionary forces. 

And in the case of the October ""revolution"" it fits into what you describe if you see it as a continuation of the uprisings in the spring, but the uprisings in the spring did have genuine popular support, not least as seen by the outcome of the votes for the Constituent Assembly. But October, was unambiguously a coup: No popular uprising, and a movement that had the support of only a minority rising up against a government that had just gotten a de facto democratic mandate through the CA election.","Norwegian, living in UK",/r/europe/comments/ctdq42/today_51_years_ago_soviet_army_invaded/exnwxvw/,rubygeek,1566465337

Some countries such as France are experiencing this historical trend without violence, others people as Spanish have suffered terrorist acts. The issue of minority languages has also been a social problem in Italy and has been one of the components of the *questione meridiona*le. In the United Kingdom, tensions in Scotland and Ireland are lower, but the annihilation of one language (Irish) and the existence of another (Scottish) are sources of social tensions. On the other hand, in Germany and France, the end of minority languages has never killed or been a subject of division and discord. The uniformity of language has been much better managed in these countries than elsewhere.

In alsace, the figures on young people are very enlightening. While all schools offer courses in Alsatian, they are not chosen by students who prefer to learn standard English or German.

5909,"No. I can't speak for this particular bank, but banks already charge you for everything, including just maintaining an account. Every single customer is already paying for that service, no matter how poor or rich they are. Negative interest has nothing to do with the cost of running a bank or keeping the money safe. It has to do with trying to force people to actively invest their money or face punishment in the form of reduction in their savings. It's a harsh measure that likely aims to stimulate a weak economy by forcing money to be invested. That is likely why only the rich are first targeted, since poor people don't have the extra money to invest anyway, so there is little to gain from them, but it could get the masses to get active in unwanted ways.",,/r/europe/comments/ctmsp0/a_danish_bank_is_launching_a_06_negative_interest/exnc0ly/,DoubleSteve,1566451398

In fact, I read the section of the UN convention on the laws of the seas (article 19.2.g) that is germane to this: Here's the whole things, emphasis mine:

Meaning of innocent passage

1. Passage is innocent so long as it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State. Such passage shall take place in conformity with this Convention and with other rules of international law.

*2. Passage of a foreign ship shall be considered to be prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State if in the territorial sea it engages in any of the following activities:*

(a) any threat or use of force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of the coastal State, or in any other manner in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations;

(b) any exercise or practice with weapons of any kind;

(c) any act aimed at collecting information to the prejudice of the defence or security of the coastal State;

(d) any act of propaganda aimed at affecting the defence or security of the coastal State;

(e) the launching, landing or taking on board of any aircraft;

(f) the launching, landing or taking on board of any military device;

*(g) the loading or unloading of any commodity, currency or person contrary to the customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations of the coastal State;*

(h) any act of wilful and serious pollution contrary to this Convention;

(i) any fishing activities;

(j) the carrying out of research or survey activities;

(k) any act aimed at interfering with any systems of communication or any other facilities or installations of the coastal State;

(l) any other activity not having a direct bearing on passage.

Here's the TL;DR 2. Passage of a foreign ship shall be considered to be prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State if in the territorial sea it engages in any of the following activities: (g) the loading or unloading of any commodity, currency or person contrary to the customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations of the coastal State;

So if a ship is violating the immigration laws of the country, then it is considered prejudicial and thus the UNCLOS is not applicable.",Amerilurker.,/r/europe/comments/csi1oq/is_salvini_closing_just_harbours_or_also_the_rule/exneeh1/,TreebeardButIntoBDSM,1566453543
