17,"&gt; It's strengthening the rights of the massive corporations holding the copyrights

It's strengthening everyone with copyrights (hint: there is the word ""rights""). 

&gt;it's weakening the internet ability to freely share information as a result.

It doesn't, it just gives the rightsholder the right over his own work. For example, if you're a news website, Google can't just copy your articles and claim it as their own. Hence my analogy with stealing things.

&gt;YouTube will have to actually ensure that nothing ever gets on their site that is copyrighted in any way

This is untrue.

&gt;as they will be directly for everything on their platform

I assume you forgot the word ""liable"", yes, and there is nothing wrong with that. It's like you having a gun in your house and then saying it's someone else's, so you're not to blame.

&gt;responsibility falling on the people actually uploading this content.

It's already clear that that approach doesn't work.

&gt;There is so many hours uploaded to YouTube every minute that this is virtually impossible and will mean that YouTube will have to severely restrict the freedom of users in order to meet this incredibly strict standard through very aggressive algothitm that will undoubtedly have a lot of false positives.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_between_Airbus_and_Boeing#Subsidies

&gt;Boeing has continually protested over launch aid in the form of credits to Airbus, while Airbus has argued that Boeing receives illegal subsidies through military and research contracts and tax breaks.[115]
&gt;
&gt;In July 2004, Harry Stonecipher (then CEO of Boeing) accused Airbus of abusing a 1992 bilateral EU-US agreement regarding large civil aircraft support from governments. Airbus is given reimbursable launch investment (RLI, called ""launch aid"" by the U.S.) from European governments with the money being paid back with interest, plus indefinite royalties if the aircraft is a commercial success.[116] Airbus contends that this system is fully compliant with the 1992 agreement and WTO rules. The agreement allows up to 33 per cent of the program cost to be met through government loans which are to be fully repaid within 17 years with interest and royalties. These loans are held at a minimum interest rate equal to the cost of government borrowing plus 0.25%, which would be below market rates available to Airbus without government support.[117] Airbus claims that since the signing of the EU-U.S. agreement in 1992, it has repaid European governments more than U.S.$6.7 billion and that this is 40% more than it has received.
&gt;
&gt;Airbus argues that pork barrel military contracts awarded to Boeing (the second largest U.S. defence contractor) are in effect a form of subsidy (see the KC-X program). The U.S. government support of technology development via NASA also provides support to Boeing. In its recent products such as the 787, Boeing has also received support from local and state governments.[118] Airbus's parent, EADS, itself is a military contractor, and is paid to develop and build projects such as the Airbus A400M transport and various other military aircraft.[119]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/bb0s34/ustr_proposes_products_for_tariff_countermeasures/ekfvdi6/,vokegaf,1554775806

1. The people America has killed are random and mostly due to some other reason. There were the eugenics programs in the 30s however that was a shorter period and killed far less. China on the other hand, is genociding people to replace with the Han Chinese, as a way to build unity.

2. Concerning the people killed in other countries, I have to agree. America’s actions in 3rd world countries are just to cause contention and fuel the Military Industry Complex. The only exception I feel is the war in Ukraine. That was caused by Russia, not America.

3. If you gave China a chance to make Europe their puppet, they would. China hasn’t yet had a chance in history to be in position and ready to dominate, so let’s not get ahead of ourselves and assume they will be benevolent rulers in Asia’s Century (the 21st century). Don’t give them the green flag to build European reliance on China. America certainly didn’t help Europe anymore than they needed to during the Cold War, in fact only “enough” to get Europe started on rebuilding itself. 

Honestly, I don’t know. I really don’t. But the division I use to see what motivates American and Chinese interests.

437,"&gt;Neither is the age of the earth, the shape of the earth, the effect of Co2 on global warming, the effect of vaccines, a hell of a lot of religious claims, the moon landing etc. Want to ban those too? People have no problem just ignoring flat earth nutters, laughing at them, arguing against them etc.

Great I can repeat my same argument again and again.

I must have forgotten when those were events directly responsible for the murder of 6 million people and survivors/their family who are still experiencing the consequences.  Or that denying them was synonymous with antisemitism and that bringing them up is a psychological attack on survivors.  

&gt;Which would surely make religion worse? People still preach the shit that have led to atrocities when it comes to religion. Someone saying ""I don't believe that &lt;insert genocide&gt; happened."" isn't preaching anything, it's just stating a crazy opinion.

Worse or better is irrelevant, what it does make it is not comparable. The comparison would be denying the atrocities of the Spanish inquisition, except in this case some victims are still alive and their families are still dealing with very real consequences. 

&gt;No, we generally have restrictions when it comes to threats etc. and not just on voicing an opinion or view. Some nutter saying that he doesn't believe in some genocide is not a threat to anyone, it's just his opinion. If he can't voice a non-threatening opinion you simply can't claim to have any kind of freedom of speech anymore. If his opinions can be banned so can yours, it's just a matter of who's in charge and how authoritarian they happen to be.

Again just ignoring that violence can be non-physical, what about psychological and emotional abuse? Are those not threats? If your opinions are A) empirically wrong and B) are a form of abuse towards a population group then yeah maybe it should be looked at. 

&gt;What does that prove besides education being shit? You don't honestly think they got elected *because* they denied those crimes, do you? If you base your vote on someone's stance on whether or not something is a genocide or not, you might want to check your priorities I'd say. Surely the economy, education, immigration, taxes, welfare system etc. etc. should be more important to a country than a nutty opinion on something that happened in the past somewhere else?

It proves that your claim that ""Is your country's education so fucking bad that a random nutter making an empty claim is a threat to your people?"" is oh so naive because yeah most countries are dealing with these problems and yup a large part due to failings in education but that isn't going to solve it alone. I never said they got elected for that but they got elected in-spite of that so obviously people will accept or overlook hate speech of that sort. If you think economic, education, immigration, tax, and welfare you agree with are a justified reason to vote for someone actively looking to negatively target marginalized groups then maybe you should check **your** priorities.

456,"&gt;The most glaring mistake the piece makes, and I'm surprised its narrator  does not seem to realize this, is that it conflates ""race"" with culture  and economic situation. This difference is important, as race is  genetic, inherited, and immutable.

&amp;#x200B;

I watched the video several months ago so my comments maybe aren't 100% accurately corresponding to the narration. As ethnic groups share mostly the same culture, probably he uses it in that sense. I don't think he means behavior is genetically inherited. Maybe he didn't communicate the message well, if that's what he said. Of course culture is the right term.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; if it's not Pakistanis or whatever doing it, it'll be someone white, as we see time and again with other cases 

I'm not so sure about this. I don't think there are any other racial groups in the UK (except 1-2 African gangs) acting in an organized gang manner, gang raping children and forcing them to prostitution, physically abusing them and threatening their families. Also the targeting of the victims was again racially motivated, as the vast majority of the kids were white girls and also some Sikh girls. Most pedophiles act as individuals. The way these gangs acted is unique as far as I can tell, similar with gangs trafficking women for prostitution, with the difference they were pedophilia gangs.

Similar networks exist in other countries too, [as in the Netherlands for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wak2wj6QK-c).

Of course pedophiles exist in other races too, but I don't think they operate in organized networks, at least not in the UK and generally in Europe. 

By the way, still the government is responsible to coordinate authorities. There is political responsibility and the fact that no one in the police faced any consequences while official reports conclude that complaints were ignored, for me means lack of interest, despite the seriousness of the crimes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I have *never* faced this issue. But  then again I'm not saying racist stuff. As a firm egalitarian, I believe  that people deserve to be judged as individuals, not because of their  skin, their sex, or their nationality. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think he means that's the general belief, not that actually someone is going to attack you or confront you. But it still affects some of the decisions of those holding these belief.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; But they aren't ignored?

&amp;#x200B;

If it needs a scandal to break out for the authorities to take action, then they are ignored.

The rape gangs issue in some UK cities was going on about 2 decades, if I recall that right, before the police taking any meaningful action. FGM happens in the thousands. That means, though it is illegal, it is basically ignored. Same thing goes for forced marriages. I don't think any serious action has been taken against them as with FGM, but I can't remember if they are similarly common right now, but I think they aren't.

Also what a journalist said shows there is a tendency for cover up. He said something like this: ""When a pattern emerged that all gangs were Pakistani, I thought I'm a liberal, how can I write about that?"" I think he said liberal, or if not, certainly he mentioned some other political orientation. That's why I don't like to follow any political parties or ideologies. I hate to have anyone dictate my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; ""let's close all the borders!"", because such answers don't really solve  anything and on the long term just lead to more problems.

&amp;#x200B;

It would certainly solve problems that are not existent between native population and are exclusively imported, as FGM, forced marriages, honor killings etc. But it's not a fair solution, because it affects everyone, including people who haven't committed the slightest crime. The aim should always be justice.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The ultimate outcome doesn't change the situation before the wars, nor  how they were presented to the public, though. Why would things have  been different under a direct democracy? You can't have people vote on  every single detail, possibly even the war plan itself. At some point,  the electorate *has* to relinquish control to someone representing them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not 100% if direct democracy would solve the problem either, it certainly won't solve every problem, but I guess the war goal should be the main interest before voting. But even if direct democracy wouldn't solve the problem, politicians are still 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I don't think this is true. The problem is  large parts of the country not being under control of the central  government in Kabul. This does not change that the situation in places  that *are* under control have improved compared to the days when the Taliban would behead people in a sports stadium.  
&gt;  
&gt;No  force on Earth can just fast-forward cultural development a couple  generations to undo the damage that was done to Afghanistan due to the  civil war, but you can create the conditions that enable this change.

&amp;#x200B;

Correct me if I'm wrong, but after Nazism was defeated, I think no remaining active cells operated in any European country. The results were not ultimate, because the war didn't have as a goal women's rights restoration.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;According to [German federal statistics](https://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Downloads/Infothek/Statistik/Asyl/aktuelle-zahlen-zu-asyl-februar-2019.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)  for the first months of this year, 42% of all asylum seekers are  female. I also cannot find numbers for country distribution according to  gender, but I'm not sure why Afghanistan and Iraq should so massively  lag behind the other countries listed. It's probably lower than the  average, but single digits? Nah, I'd like to see something official  before I believe that.

&amp;#x200B;

You're probably right. 33% of Afghans in Germany are women. Still there is a huge gender imbalance but the female percentage is not a one digit number.

Still I have the impression I had seen a PDF file with an even smaller number, possibly a single digit number. Maybe it was a file with statistics referring to the 2015 migrants wave?

507,"No, it most certainly does not. I'd like you to show me how your paper came up with the numbers for lexical distance. What it says is this:

&gt;The paper by Hart-Gonzalez and Lindemann (1993) reports language scores for
43 languages for English-speaking Americans of average ability after set periods (16
weeks and 24 weeks) of foreign language training. These languages are reported in the
stub of Table 1, with their matching Census of Population Public Use Microdata Sample
(PUMS) language codes for the 1990 and 2000 Censuses reported in the “direct code”
column. Using the Ethnologue Language Family Index published by Grimes and Grimes
(1993), the right-most column indicates the linguistic score for that language after 24
weeks of instruction based on the Hart-Gonzalez and Lindemann (1993) report. The
range is from a low score (harder to learn) of 1.00 for Japanese to a high score (easier to
learn) of 3.00 for Afrikaans, Norwegian and Swedish. The score for French is 2.50 and
for Mandarin 1.50. These scores suggest a ranking of linguistic distance from English
among these languages: Japanese being the most distant, followed by Mandarin, then
French and then Afrikaans, Norwegian and Swedish as the least distant


What is even worse is that it even mentions later in the paper:
&gt;The measure developed here is based on the ability of Americans to learn a
variety of languages in fixed periods of time. The lower the scores on a standardized
proficiency test, the greater is the distance between these languages and English. With
the aid of a linguist, scores are inferred for languages for which a direct measure does not
exist. 

That is all it mentions. It doesn't even mention which of those lexical distances are just made up with ""the aid of a linguist"". Then it goes on to correlate those numbers with English proficiency of immigrant groups in the US and Canada. All this shows is that levels of English proficiency in a home taken off census data are somewhat related to a study done almost 30 years ago. What are you trying to prove with this? It's almost as bad as you picking a random text and pulling cognates from it to show how ""close"" Romanian is to English. At least this has some semblance of something analytical.

This paper goes on to list ""Rumanian"" (it doesn't even spell it right!) with a score of 3.00 making it the easiest language for English speakers to learn; on par with Swedish, Norwegian, and Afrikaans, but easier to learn than all other Romance languages. Something is clearly wrong there. I can't point at something and say what since I don't know more about who those ""English speakers of average ability"" were, or how they measured proficiency and under what circumstances. Maybe it was just two people who already spoke a bunch of Romance languages who studied Romanian for 24 weeks and aced a test. Maybe that number was just made up ""with the aid of a linguist"". What can you possibly garner more from that paragraph?

I wouldn't classify myself as a linguist, but I taught English as a foreign language, and Romanian is my mother tongue. I also studied and speak 3 other languages. It's not about pseudo-intellectualism. I just have some perspective by speaking both English and Romanian natively along with some of the other languages in question. I don't believe Romanian is as easy for English speakers to learn as is French or Afrikaans.

555,"Wrong.

1) Danzig was founded by Poland than conquered by Teutonic state, then petitioned the Polish kingdom to annex it during the middle ages.

2) During the Swedish invasion when other cities in northern Poland opened the gates to the Swedish troops and welcomed them as Protestant allies Danzig resisted.

3) **As late as 1813 Danzig petitioned Prussia to be reunited with Poland. Danzig didn't want to be a part of Germany until after a century of Prussian Germanisation efforts.**

4) The Danzig rebellion was a dispute over the election of a new King, because the French king left Poland and some nobles quickly elected Batory, even Lithuania, as required by the Union of Lublin, did not get a say, they too were angry and threatened civil war, eventually they accepted Batory as King as well. 

5) You cant claim people who lived in Poland for centuries and had nothing to do with Germany besides a common language were German. Language does not determine nationally, that's just bad history. Especially during a time when 

* German was the lingua franca, even educated Poles knew German
* There were no standardized national education system or need to use it to raise everyone with the same language
* It was a hansa city so its language was a matter of circumstance not nationality, similarly to Americans not being English,

5) Danzig actively participated in Polish politics and was one of the Commonwealths most important cities. It only prospered like that due to the rights Poland gave it and it was Poland's main trading port, because of this there is no Danzig without Poland and no Poland without Danzig.

6) It was the center of the Polish Lutheran movement in Poland.

7) There are actually  no official records on Population demographics from the city, but we can estimate based on similar cities, Konigsberg in 1530 approximately 25% of the population were Polis Lutherans, not counting Catholics. Danzig, unlike Konigsberg being a part of Poland for much longer and given facts 5,6, and that many merchants would also be bilingual, the Polish speaking population could have been around 30%

&amp;#x200B;

The people there were probably like Quebec, some, very small amount, want nothing to do with the rest of Canada and want to succeed,  the rest acknowledge they are Canadians with strong regional identity. They were first Danziger's, than loyal Polish citizens, example, Jeremias Flacks sometimes signed himself as Flacks Polonus

636,"Absolutely not. As late as 1813 Gdansk pettitioned Prussia to be reunited with Poland, again. You can't claim people who lived in Poland for centuries and had nothing to do with Germany besides a common language were German, not when
A) German was the Lingua Franca and even educated Poles spoke German
B) There was no mandatory national education  system or need to use it to make the whole nation speak one language
C) It was part of the Hansa league so their language was a matter of circumstance not nationality, Like Americans Speaking English despite not being English.
As for the actual Polish speaking part there are no official records from the city but we can get an estimate from similar cities, Konigsberg in 1530 25% of the city were Polish Lutheran's alone, not counting Catholics. Gdansk actually being a part of Poland and active  and one of the most importanf participant in Its Politics, as well as the center of the Polish Lutheran movement in Poland, and that most merchants would have knowledge of Polish aswell the it would be around 30% Polish speaking.
The city only flourished because it was Poland's main port and that's why there was no Danzig without Poland or Poland without Danzig. 
In reality it was like Québec,  Some people would rather be independent(there is a small succesionist movement there) and do not care about the rest of non French speaking Canada, while others aknowlege they are Canadians with a strong regional idienity.

By that same argument you could argue that hate speech with the intent to incite violence, which is illegal, will lead to DPRC level abuses since its the first step in limiting free speech.

&amp;#x200B;

11 and 13 got renamed 13 and 15 from memory as they iterated, and you're right, they suck. However, most of the regulation in the EU directly protects its citizens, they're not immune to cocking it up though.

&amp;#x200B;

 The counter again is that the US has too little regulation, but America at a macro level functions relatively well. It's not great once you get down to a granular level involving actual people. 

&amp;#x200B;

But both are successful. While our internet will be affected by measures aimed at protecting rights holders, the US internet is affected by its own regulators trying to kill net neutrality and redefine the definition of acceptable speeds is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I always take issue with anyone who believes regulation is anathema to success.  America has had a very different history to the EU. The EU's success has in part been its egalitarian stance towards its members. In the Proto EU just after the war, when Europe was rebuilding itself, its largest period of economic growth occurred when the founding members shared food produced over capacity with members who produced under capacity. 

&amp;#x200B;

You're right that the US has great tech incubators and optimistic angels who want to back the next FaceBook. I don't dislike the US, but it's a different environment to the EU. As I said, the EU has fantastic tech research programmes which are well funded and protections for the rights of its citizens. NY is still (until fucking Brexit) the second best financial centre of the world, but where you list isn't a nationalistic policy. The fact they have the choice is still mandated by regulation.

726,"&gt; Simply not true. In fact, the EU has gotten the worst of both worlds as separate countries continue to have separate regulatory regimes

That's not true. If you comply with the relevant legislation in one country, you are considered compliant in the rest of the EU. It's true that the country can impose other requirements, but that's not going to improve by removing the EU layer.

&gt;with more regulations being added and none being repealed

Every EU directive removes the previously existing national regulations. Furthermore, all the new directives exist to address specific problems, and if the EU didn't exist, the national states would have created equivalent legislation anyway.

&gt; I believe the best way for the EU to proceed would be to take a step back and cool it on the overbearing regulations, work towards being more business friendly or at the very least allowing independent countries within it to decide to be more business friendly. Then maybe, just maybe, we'll end up with more than 1 European company in the top 25 of the world

I really can't accept writing a blank check for something hazy and ill-defined like ""less overbearing regulation"" and ""business-friendly"", just for being able to brag with company size.

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank#Controversies

&gt; **April 2015 Libor scandal**

&gt; On 23 April 2015, Deutsche Bank agreed to a combined US$2.5 billion in fines – a US$2.175 billion fine by American regulators, and a €227 million penalty by British authorities – for its involvement in the Libor scandal uncovered in June 2012. The company also pleaded guilty to wire fraud, acknowledging that at least 29 employees had engaged in illegal activity. It will be required to dismiss all employees who were involved with the fraudulent transactions.[80] However, no individuals will be charged with criminal wrongdoing. In a Libor first, Deutsche Bank will be required to install an independent monitor.[81] Commenting on the fine, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority director Georgina Philippou said ""This case stands out for the seriousness and duration of the breaches ... One division at Deutsche Bank had a culture of generating profits without proper regard to the integrity of the market. This wasn't limited to a few individuals but, on certain desks, it appeared deeply ingrained.""[80] The fine represented a record for interest rate related cases, eclipsing a $1.5 billion Libor related fine to UBS, and the then-record $450 million fine assessed to Barclays earlier in the case.[80][81] The size of the fine reflected the breadth of wrongdoing at Deutsche Bank, the bank's poor oversight of traders, and its failure to take action when it uncovered signs of abuse internally.[81]

&gt; **Role in 2007–2008 financial crisis**

&gt; In January 2017, Deutsche Bank agreed to a $7.2 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over its sale and pooling of toxic mortgage securities in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. As part of the agreement, Deutsche Bank was required to pay a civil monetary penalty of $3.1 billion and provide $4.1 billion in consumer relief, such as loan forgiveness. At the time of the agreement, Deutsche Bank was still facing investigations into the alleged manipulation of foreign exchange rates, suspicious equities trades in Russia, as well as alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran and other countries. Since 2012, Deutsche Bank had paid more than €12 billion for litigation, including a deal with U.S. mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.[82]

&gt;**2015 sanctions violations**

&gt; On 5 November 2015, Deutsche Bank was ordered to pay US$258 million (€237.2 million) in penalties imposed by the New York State Department of Financial Services and the United States Federal Reserve Bank after the bank was caught doing business with Burma, Libya, Sudan, Iran, and Syria which were under US sanctions at the time. According to the US federal authorities, Deutsche Bank handled 27,200 US dollar clearing transactions valued at more than US$10.86 billion (€9.98 billion) to help evade US sanctions between early 1999 until 2006 which are done on behalf of Iranian, Libyan, Syrian, Burmese, and Sudanese financial institutions and other entities subject to US sanctions, including entities on the Specially Designated Nationals by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.[83][84]

&gt; In response to the penalties, the bank will pay US$200 million (€184 million) to the NYDFS while the rest (US$58 million; €53.3 million) will go to the Federal Reserve. In addition to the payment, the bank will install an independent monitor, fire six employees who were involved in the incident, and ban three other employees from any work involving the bank's US-based operations.[85] The bank is still under investigation by the US Justice Department and New York State Department of Financial Services into possible sanctions violations relating to the 2014–15 Ukrainian crisis and its activities within Russia.[86]

&gt;**2017 money-laundering fine**

&gt; In January 2017, the bank was fined $425 million by the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS)[90] and £163 million by the UK Financial Conduct Authority[91] regarding accusations of laundering $10 billion out of Russia.[92][93][94]

&gt;**Relationship with Donald Trump**

&gt; Deutsche Bank is widely recognized as being the largest creditor to real-estate-mogul-turned-politician Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States, holding more than US$360 million in outstanding loans to the candidate in the months prior to his 2016 election. As of December 2017 Deutsche Bank’s role in, and possible relevance to, Trump and Russian parties cooperating to elect him was reportedly under investigation by Robert Mueller of the FBI.[95] As of March 2019, Deutsche Bank's relationship with Trump was reportedly also under investigation by two U.S. congressional committees and by the New York attorney general.[96][97]

Old and rural people are absolutely not morons, but they, simply put, might severely under-educated or ignorant in multiple subjects, simply because in their daily lives or their life experience they've not had the experience that city dwelling cosmopolitan people have. 

Like it or not, but older people in the Baltic states grew up in a propagandized occupation enforced education system, spent their developing years in such a system, normalizing it and justifying it - as otherwise they would have to live with the fact that their healthy life years were spent in bullshit being fed bullshit. However, the fact is that their level of intelligence and education about e.g. sexuality is very low and was effectively castrated by the Soviet authorities.

None here in Bulgaria, at least not really (some pay lip service to it but historically they've shown themselves to be unreliable). Not sure about the rest, but the fact that a lot of even the supposedly business-friendly parties voted *for* ridiculous forms of regulation like Articles 11 and 13 should tell you how much they're actually looking out for this issue. Hell, a lot of those opposing that particular set of regulations were the populists, a case where I agree with the end result (voting against the regulation) but not with the reasons for it (many of them just voting against EU status quo on principle).

I think this might be because of the wave of populist protectionism that is sweeping the world. In the end, Articles 11 and 13 for example will end up benefiting *someone*. If that someone is intended or not, and they are, defines if the politicians currently in power are there with the aim of actually helping or of falsely making themselves seem more needed and creating artificial problems for the sake of being the ones to fix them.

The best advice I can offer about finding who to support is unfortunately as banal as it gets. Listen *more*. Find podcasts of political leaders, long form interviews, op-eds, etc., hear them talk in more than a 30 second excerpt and allow yourself to form an opinion on who they *are*, not who they're broadcasting themselves to be (or who someone else is broadcasting them as).

892,"This may seem surprising, but as someone who knows both, I really think traditional is easier. Sure, there are more strokes, but the characters relate to each other much more logically. The simplification process destroyed a lot of this consistency. Therefore, simplified characters look simpler at first glance, and are faster to write, but require significantly more rote memorisation. 

For example, the traditional character 讓 (pronounced rang) means ""to let/make/allow"". The simplified equivalent is 让. Much simpler, right? But then compare with these other characters: 壤/嚷/穰/攘, which have different meanings but are all also pronounced rang and are unchanged between traditional and simplified, and you'll see that changing 讓 to 让 has broken the link which tells the reader the pronunciation of the character. There are many, many examples like this. 

Another problem is that some simplified characters end up looking more similar to each other than the traditional ones. For example 實，頭，買 in traditional become 实，头，买 in simplified. 

And another problem is that in some cases, multiple traditional characters with distinct meanings and pronunciations are merged into one character in simplified. For example 髮 and 發 in traditional (which mean ""hair"" and ""emit"", and are pronounced fa4 and fa1 respectively, where the numbers represent the tones), are merged into 发 in simplified. That means that when you're reading, you have no way to know which of the two pronunciations/meanings is intended, unless you examine the context. Another example is 幹 and 乾 (""to do""/gan4 and ""dry""/gan1) becoming 干. It sucks.

While I'm not a big fan of what I think is an unhealthy obsession with VCs (and companies like Juicero getting values in the hundreds of millions if not billions with jack shit to show for it), the funding opportunities in Europe seem to be far enough on the other end of the scale that talented Europeans would rather start businesses in the States. 

Hell, you know they're fucking up when Bulgaria's becoming a startup capital in the region by virtue of having more than 0 VC options.

Bulgaria, for all its corruption and quite poor rural areas, is comparatively regulation-light, with low taxes and no tax raise in sight (we have a surprisingly balanced budget) without sacrificing too many services (i.e. it's not like we have US-grade garbage healthcare for example). 

I hope that at least here we can maintain some of this friendlier business environment because that's brought up wages in the big cities ridiculously fast and it has brought so many opportunities for young people.

I never said that the map is meaningless without qualification. If you provide a definition of what “highly educated means” (which the map should have done) then the map obviously isn’t meaningless. With that context you can then properly discuss what it means without everyone projecting what “highly educated” actually means.

I think I might even share your frustration with people disagreeing with a particular definition or construct and then just spending all their time arguing about definitions and constructs which is boring, predictable and doesn’t actually get at the root of what something means. I also agree it’s awful whenever someone is projecting that a map or graph is saying something only then to vehemently disagree with that projection which frequently isn’t very well rooted in facts and understanding.

But they obviously have to apply the common external tariff. Which means Turkey has to provide tariff-free access to countries that have free trade agreements with the EU, but those countries don't have to provide tariff-free access to Turkey. 

For non-EU trade, customs Union is a pretty one-sided deal. Leaving the EU to become a Customs Union member is pure madness. ",Verfassungspatriot,/r/europe/comments/bark5n/brexit_experts_please_enlighten_me/ekdlki1/,fluchtpunkt,1554717504

because you already mentioned germans, there is a german psychologist called Friedemann Schulz von Thun who created “The four-sides model“ which revolves around the topic that messages between an Sender and Receiver are to be categorised in 4 aspects.
1. Factual information
2. Self-revelation
3. Relationship
4. Appeal

As I said it is more about what is subcommunicated when Serbs use the word Šiptar, so let‘s focus on number
3. Relationship(What I think about you/and how we get along)
When Serbs use the word, they underlyingly want to express and convey that the people they refer to are little cockroaches, not even humans, who dont deserve to life and can be treated as second class. The use of Šiptari has never been used in Serbia to denote to some good Albanians, they always used Albanac in regards to that. The term Šiptari is/was always used in conflict situations and racism.

In all history, Serbs never refered to Albanians as Šiptar, so why now?? Does the word, “Shqiptar“ come from the Serb word of “shqipoj“(to speak clearly) ;), so thats why you use it?.
The word is totally alien in your language, so using it “Makes zero sense.“

The tax-funded higher education is more useful to those that would make use of it but aren't *so* impressive as to have others literally voluntarily pay them to study (i.e. people that are more average, less the types that will be team leads and executives in top companies and more the capable but not in leadership position team members that make up said companies).",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/baqwrl/china/ekdlpzb/,SharkyIzrod,1554717774

On paper. Reality's quite different, especially considering how easily our politicians can be bought and influenced.

&gt;As to Putin, no his interests are not at all aligned with yours. The EU wants you to be prosperous, democratic, free with rule of law and human rights. Putin does not even allow Russians to have that. As to Kosovo, he does it just to try a destabilise the EU, it has nothing to do with you and your interests. You're just a pawn in this and an unstable region that he wants is not in your interests.

Again, if the EU cared about that they wouldn't support Vučko and his gang. Yeah, of course Putin doesn't support us out of love ( he does no doubt love us personally though, seeing how he's a traditional Russian nationalist and those love us), he knows there's no place for love in geopolitics, but his interests still align with ours. He supports us on the Kosovo issue and supports our stance regarding the 90s wars. Meanwhile the EU opposes us on both. 

And who's to say an unstable region wouldn't suit us. The status quo isn't precisely in our favor.

And when things got out of control, when shit suddenly hit the fan, and massacres actually started happening left and right, everybody, **literally everybody** in the international community backed off and didn't even remotely act to contribute in preventing it from happening and/or making it stop, until most of the damage had been done.

And yet, do you think only the French government had reports and intelligence on what was going on? **YEARS before**, everybody knew that a genocide was brewing, and everybody knew when it started to happen. **EVERYBODY**. They withdrew nonetheless, didn't do a flying fuck about it, and shamelessly let the French deal with it, because they were the only ones already involved on the field. That's fucking convenient.

Do you notice how none of your governments are really raising their voices *that much* about the Rwandese genocide? Yeah. Exactly. That's not a coincidence.

&amp;nbsp;

I give **zero** shit about ""national pride"", ""State secret"", or any similar bullshit that could get in the way of truth and justice. I'm more than willing to know what exactly France did in Rwanda, and if France is proven to be, even remotely, responsible of willingly facilitating the genocide, I want it to be fully and publicly acknowledged, and justice to be served.

But casually and simplistically blaming France of purposeful complicity of genocide with that much certainty, when nobody really knows what happened exactly, in such an unstable region --where over 10k Tutsi were already massacred and 300k more exiled when Rwanda became independent in 62--, in such an obscure shitshow fueled by tribalism and caste hatred --a direct consequence of how the Belgian colonial administration managed the whole area and played one ethnic group against the other for decades--, is very seriously fucked up, and an outstanding case of hypocrite, clueless and simplistic scapegoating.

&amp;nbsp;

Even 80 years later, we still don't know with any kind of certainty if the Allies were or weren't aware of what was actually going on in Nazi concentration, and then extermination camps. But surprisingly, everybody and his dog seems to know all the truths about what happened in Rwanda.

1175,"Both are directly bound to immigration.

Mass immigration of ""refugees"" and low skilled workers is depressing wages in Germany to a significant degree, while also overwhelming the housing market due to the constant influx of new people, especially in the cities.

If Germany would put an end to this mass immigration, you would quickly see both rising wages AND a significant improvement in the housing market.

To prove the point, look at Japan, a country without significant numbers of immigrants:

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/22/japan-free-homes-empty-houses-given-away-and-sold-cheap.html

&gt;* Japan's vacant homes are receiving more attention given the increasing number of affordable — and sometimes free — houses put up for sale online on websites called ""akiya banks.""
*    Many of such sites are set up by local governments and communities to better manage the supply and demand for the growing stock of empty houses in their respective towns.
*    Japan's vacant home phenomenon has largely concentrated in rural towns, but has started to show up in the suburbs and larger cities, according to various media reports.



But I doubt most of the people at this protest are able to make this connection and even saying this will get you branded as a Nazi in Germany. All immigration is good, if you say otherwise, you're a right-wing extremist who probably wants to genocide immigrants, that's about the level of political and societal discourse these days in the country.",,/r/europe/comments/baof4e/thousands_of_germans_protest_against_rising_rent/ekddsy1/,SubscribeToPieDiePew,1554704219

The party wasn't reformed by Mikael Jansson, it was given a proper scrub so that the racist, far-right turd looked like a bog-standard conservative party. the views of the people in the party never changed and the people who supported them didn't either. The only difference is that 2 decades after this attempt to clean their image they have managed to convince a lot of medelsvensson-rasister that they aren't radical, they are just ''proper Swedes who just want to defend Sweden from the boogeyman''. It's clear that Mikael never intened to actually reform the party, he was always just trying to appeal to a larger amount of people.

Who knows, maybe Jimmie is actually a moderate who justs dislikes immigration. Chances are that he is just as rotten to the core as his friends and predecessors are though.

Maybe consider that as time went on the likelihood of a war with France - wars with which had dominated German history for the last 150 years - decreased from unlikely to kinda unthinkable. And on the other spectrum you had the Cold War. And you don't need to be a master strategist that it was kinda besides the point to spend huge efforts on being ready to fight that war - Germany would have been *the* battlefield of between two nuclear superpowers who would throw everything they had at Germany in order to prevent loosing it to the other. 

Yes, war with its immediate neighbors has become ever less likely for Germany and that is mostly the success of NATO and the European project. But this complacency with peace is not the full explanation for low defense spending. The other prospect for war being total nuclear annihilation not just makes efforts to being able to fight such a war seem delusional, it also increases the appeal pacifism generally, not because things are so safe but because they aren't.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/balhpw/the_new_german_question_what_happens_when_europe/ekd7gue/,Bekoni,1554696743

The price of remaining is a major clash between Britain and the EU over the future of the whole project.

The British public does not want closer integration. The rest of you do.

Money is nothing next to the shitstorm we ALL face if the UK stays in.

Either 65million people get dragged into an unhappy United States of Europe and become a cancer, a poison, a fractious bunch of rebel’s who hate the whole project and want it to fail, growing increasingly more angry as the years go on. 

Or, that same 65million people hold back the integration the rest want, completely eroding every shred of good will between our countries and eventually leading us to probably be kicked out. Or with the EU collapsing because it can’t face the many problems it faces as a divided force.

Seriously everyone on this sub, hold off on your fucking downvotes and circle jerk and open your eyes to this.

Do not answer with the same empty words of “BUT U DONT SPEAK 4 DA UK NOT EVERYONE IS AGAINST INTEGRATION”  because you are WRONG. The entire British establishment and an overwhelming majority of the public do NOT want closer integration, they only want the bloody status quo, to stay how we are right now!

How on earth can these two diametrically opposed unyielding viewpoints be reconciled? Somebody reply with a solution other than leaving.

There is no economic cost that is too much to pay, if it avoids the truly horrific cost of staying. The economy will recover. The markets will adapt. Lost jobs will be replaced. Trade will not stop.

1261,"1. Florida has a tremendous amount of flat, buildable land that Greece doesn't.  Greece is something like 85% mountains. So, while in theory the two are similar in size -and both are similarly geographically positioned within the US and EU respectively-  Greece has a lot more building restrictions. Not to mention olive groves, vineyards, protected forests/mountain and nature areas, etc, *which are part of the country's tourist appeal*, not just beaches.  Florida is just beaches, theme parks and conventions, and golf courses (golf courses are very water intensive, and not the best idea for a Mediterranean country. Spain has given them a go, but it's questioned whether Spain actually benefits from golf tourism). So, Greece can't build like Florida, because it would kill he tourism industry, not help it.
2. Florida has warm weather year-round, and thus much less seasonality.  Greece may be warmer than northern Europe in the winter, but it can still be chilly and it's also the rainy season.  During the high season (July-August), Greece could very well approach Florida levels, but can't have that year round. This is the big elephant in the room we're ignoring when comparing to Florida.

Greece's tourism industry may look small compared to Florida, but Florida could very well be an outlier.  When you compare Greece to other high-tourism European countries (like Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, or Austria) Greece comes out as about the same or more touristy (in proportion to size).  For example, Spain is four times larger than Greece in both area and population, but ""only"" receives a little over twice as many tourists as Greece (and that's despite the year-round nature of some of its destinations like Barcelona or the Canaries). Mexico receives slightly more tourists than Greece, despite being a far larger country, and having the same favorable market proximity as Greece (Mexico being so close to US and Canada, and Greece being so close to Northern Europe).

That said, I think 40 million can be sustainable if those 7 million additional people are funneled into the right places.  Despite the differences with Florida I mentioned above, I think 40 million isn't something crazy like 120 million. However, Greece has enough low-spending 20-year-old Brits and Swedes, and needs those extra seven million to skew more towards wealthier and/or older.  I do think many areas in the countryside/coasts/islands can take more.  But a major growth area should also be Athens and Thessaloniki (as city-break destinations) as well as year-round convention tourism, and make Athens a leading convention city in Europe (there's a major urban renewal project, with investors waiting to put up the money, waiting for clearance once the NIMBYs stop fighting it).  The last two (conventions and city-break tourism) are actually official policy goals of the state as well as SETE (the association/industry lobby group of tourism-related businesses, which is very active in tourism policy in Greece).",,/r/europe/comments/b69z86/33_million_of_tourist_visited_greece_in_2018_in_a/ekd9mk1/,skyduster88,1554698917

Not sure what you mean. Could you please provide examples?

&gt; Licensing fees? To who?

To the utility trying to licence the plant. Entergy, FirstEnergy, Excelon, etc.

&gt; Nuclear plants take much longer to build than they do get permission to build, so thats a nonissue.

That's demonstrably false. Physical construction is miniscule compared to getting a licence granted.

&gt; Nuclear plants are huge. Some nuclear research facilities are thousands of acres in size.

Sure, but we're talking about power *density*. The amount of power output per square footage beats solar and wind. Plus, the thermal efficiency is also greater.

&gt; The highly radioactive waste also takes up much more space than you are insinuating.

Nope. I've been on a few spent fuel storage pads. They're not that big. Walmart parking lots are bigger than them. That is a fact as well. And the spent fuel pools are part of the controlled area (i.e. within the plant perimeter fence) and they're relatively small, too.

&gt; They must be left in pools of circulating water for decades.

Again, this is 100% false. Spent fuel cans are being loaded these days with a 50kW decay heat load. Minimum time in the pool is 3 years prior to loading for dry storage. HOLTEC , a vendor for spent fuel storage, is touting dry storage with 1 year in the pool. ""Decades"" is absolutely false.

I'm going to just address one more thing:

&gt; I mean think about how fucking stupid nuclear power is: “lets use this power source only literal nuclear physicists know how to operate and by the way you can also make nuclear weapons from it”

This right here shows me you're not that informed about the nuclear power cycle, it's pros and cons, and are quick to shit all over it from a position of ignorance. I mean, if you're inferring that the fuel in a reactor can be used to create a bomb, then we'll just stop now.

1345,"&gt; In the way that they're citizens of Iran...

Azerbaijanis aren't as culturally ""Iranian"" as you may think.

&gt;An ethnic group that resides in Iran and has roots within the territory of Iran.

Jews, Armenians, Assyrians and other ethnic minorities have roots in Iran. That doesn't mean that they are culturally Iranian.

&gt;(Iranian)-Azeri culture is Iranian. Just as Persian culture is Iranian. But that doesn't make Azeri culture Persian or vice versa.

Okay, I see where the confusion resides. To me, Iranian culture = Persian culture, that is how it is to many in Iran as well. There is a reason why Iran pushes for a singular Persian culture toward all minorities, only allows Persian to be taught/spoken in schools, etc. It is apart of their assimilation policies that were created by Reza Shah Pahlavi. The Islamic Republic to this day continues those policies, they are just less overt and more manipulative about it. Reza Shah Pahlavi's thugs would beat Azerbaijanis for speaking their language in public for example.

&gt;You do like the Azeri Iranians though right?

Yes, we like Azerbaijanis, Turkmen, Qashqais, and the other ethnic groups related to us. Azerbaijanis for the most part don't want to be apart of Iran and don't identify with Iranian peoples. It wasn't that long ago when Persians were raping, pillaging and destroying the lives of many Azerbaijanis. That is why some of my family from my fathers side fleed to Russia during the 1940's. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan_People%27s_Government

- According to the U.S. Supreme Court Justice, William O. Douglas, while the Russian Army had been on its best behavior when stationed in Azerbaijan, the Iranian Army behaved as an occupying force and brutalized the local inhabitants. **The beards of peasants were burned, their wives and daughters raped. Houses were plundered and livestock were stolen. The Army left a trail of death and destruction behind it.**[24]

Now you see an example of how being ""Iranian"" is meaningless. Especially considering how to this day they suppress the Azerbaijani language, [depicted Azerbaijanis as cockroaches on national newspapers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/09/Iran_Azeri_Cartoon.png/300px-Iran_Azeri_Cartoon.png), throw Azerbaijani national figures into Evin prison or making them and their families permanently disappear, encouraging Persian males to marry Azerbaijani females, etc. 

We have more in common with Lezgins, Talysh and Anatolian Turks culturally speaking, and we don't get along great with Iranians which is why I had issue with your post.

1430,"Since 1978 about 5 million people have been born using in vitro fertilization, where the egg is fertilized from a sperm sample in a laboratory. This helps couples conceive when they’d otherwise have been sterile, usually due to problems with the fathers sperm.

Starting around the 1990s, in order to overcome mitochondrial diseases, scientists made the first “three parent baby.” A cytoplasmic transfer from the egg of a healthy woman is injected into the egg of a woman with dysfunctional mitochondria. Then the fathers sperm is used to fertilize the egg, leading to a healthy baby.

In 2006, a Japanese scientist discovered how to create artificial stem cells, iPSCs from a tissue sample. An iPS cell can be further induced to form healthy sperm, for men with fertility problems. This is called in-vitro gametogenesis, and can allow any couple to have a child. At the moment, they would require a fertile woman to carry the child. That’s not a problem for lesbians or a normal straight couple. But for gay men or a couple with a sterile woman, it doesn’t help. That may change in a few decades with research in exogenesis, and artificial wombs.

How is this immoral? We’re talking about removing mitochondrial diseases, provided sterile patients the ability to conceive, and allowing legally married same sex couples the ability to have children. What’s immoral about that? If you’re argument is that we don’t know the risks, then buddy, we already are working through that. That’s why it’s taking so long, because of medical ethics that we’re devoutly following.

Yeah plenty of people equate cuteness to value, which is ridiculous when you think about it.

1487,"Normally, one would expect construction if the cost of housing rises sufficiently above the cost of construction — a developer can make money from building.  That is, it would normally self-regulate to a fair degree.

So if that doesn't happen, it's going to be because of one of a number of different issues.  And you'd want to know which one is at fault before choosing a remedy.

* Restrictions on construction.  Height limitations are common.  If housing is at the max height, I cannot build up.  If housing is near the max height, it may not be worthwhile to knock down existing buildings to build more.  Property owners have a good incentive to try to block more construction, as insufficient housing drives up the value of their property.  My guess is that this is one of the more-common causes and that this has a lot to do with prices today in pricey European cities, but the specifics differ on a city-by-city basis.  Protected historic properties, etc also do this.  Opposition to more traffic or noise or what-have-you.

* Inability to obtain capital.  A developer cannot get funds to start building, or people cannot borrow funds to get the up-front cost to buy housing on credit.  I don't think that this is a problem in Europe, but in some places in the world, someone might be willing to spend money but have it impossible to decide whether they're trustworthy.  No credit or other data.

* Developer does not anticipate being able to sell the property.  If prices are skyrocketing, I don't want to buy expensive land, build housing, and not be able to recoup my investment.  This is a ""good"" cause, since it lets house supply increase start tailing off early, before a collapse in prices.

* Rapid expansion of population.  In theory, I'd think that this alone shouldn't cause an issue other then in the short term, since you can always have construction companies hire more people if the demand is there or have other companies come into the market.  But it does take a while for new buildings to be planned, approved, and constructed.

* Building code.  Fire safety, etc.  Hopefully, these are worthwhile, but any restriction will tend to add cost, and I imagine that many countries have rules that are not, in fact, worthwhile.

I just Googled up a breakdown the California government did of why housing on the California coasts is expensive, and a lot of it falls into the ""restrictions on construction"" camp.

https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2015/finance/housing-costs/housing-costs.aspx

In short, for that:

* Environment protection laws let much development be blocked or expensively-delayed by opponents of that development.

* People in an area had a fair amount of ability to block construction, including height restrictions.  Given the opportunity, they tend to do so — in doing so, they benefit, at the expense of people who *would* live there but have no vote in the matter.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/baitdm/an_idea_for_beating_down_runaway_housing_prices/ekcrlmh/,vokegaf,1554683582

1530,"&gt;Exactly, if someone honestly thinks that the Holocaust didn't happen, making a law preventing them from expressing that view will only make it seem like you're hiding something to them. You're not convincing anyone by banning certain views. It just makes it seem like you're afraid of disagreement and can't argue against their views.

Disagreement? Argument? These are facts its not a debate of views. One view is empirically right and one is not only wrong but harmful.

&gt;Should we ban religious claims and preaching as well then? Is anything even close to the number of deaths caused by religion? As far as we know they're all bullshit and lies, absolutely nothing points to any of it being remotely true.

Except that's not comparable at all, religion is a ideology that has been used to commit murder and the Holocaust is an actual fucking event itself.  Is anyone out there denying the Spanish inquisition that I'm unaware of?

&gt;The idea that someone denying a genocide is a danger that warrants getting rid of their freedom of speech is insane to me. I can't believe we're talking about Europe here, it sounds like fucking China or something.

Countries have hate speech laws to different degrees, freedom of speech was never an absolute. This is simply a slippery slope argument that isn't true. Banning hate speech like Holocaust denial doesn't lead to Chinese level censorship.

&gt;So what if some nutter denies the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide, the Rwanda genocide or whatever? Is your country's education so fucking bad that a random nutter making an empty claim is a threat to your people? Just fucking educate people properly so they can spot BS when they see/hear it.

Um yes? Where have you been the last 5 years? Erdogan, Duda, Bolsonaro all gained power while denying explicitly or implicitly war crimes. Misinformation is rampant all over the world leading to increases in xenophobia  and discrimination of all kinds of groups. Education is important but it isn't going to solve it alone.

&gt;We already see people trying to abuse this sub's anti-genocide-denial rule btw, and obviously that will happen IRL as well. Whenever the Srebenica thing comes up, some Redditors from Bosnia basically just call all Serbians deniers for simply explaining what the issue with it is. Them saying ""We don't deny it happening, we don't believe that 8000 deaths out of several millions constitutes being called a genocide."" isn't fucking denial of the action itself. If you can't even discuss the definition of genocide, what the fuck did EU just do then? That's exactly what they did as well.

It was unimportant situation, threteaning nobody, but in case of muslim atack, it would be pointless to call police as all it could do is to count bodies on the ground.

You'd have to meticulously manage every second of each animals existence to ensure the system didn't go off the rails, not to mention it being totally technologically infeasible just in scope, never mind application. The ecological impact of it - given predator/prey systems are important for maintaining biodiversity and regional environmental stability - would also be dubious, to the point where I'd struggle to see any logical reason for enforcing it. This extends just beyond predators too, to disease and parasites as well - which can cause quite horrible afflictions - but would actually end up endangering us as well with the potential for undermining our capacity to fight disease due to the emergence of super-bugs - as we've already seen happen with the overuse of penicillin and other drugs with cattle - and a whole number of other issues to consider.

The sheer amount of observation, tracking, immunisation, capture and release programmes and other systems for managing a ""no-suffering"" environment for animals would be staggering, and beyond the questions of why we would do this, there simply isn't a method to ensure it could be even be practised at even 1% efficiency - how for instance, are you supposed to stop an owl from killing a mouse and eating it except by stuffing it into a tiny cage?",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/baemdo/germany_just_shut_down_its_last_fur_farm/ekc36gy/,Gnostifox,1554666556

Polish representatives offer the German ethno-nationalists a framework where they share the country together in peace, as equals. The German ethno-nationalists don't like this and refuse, which leads to rising tensions and a war breaks out where the Polish people achieve a victory and control over half of Poland. They offer multiple olive branches to the German ethno-nationalists, but they in turn aim their guns at the Poles and dig-in, leading to decades of conflict and violence on both sides.

I strongly believe that such a dramatic shift is caused mostly by new culture in society and not by genetics or something ""you are born with"".

When Palestinians did that? When they forced Jews to exile. AFAIK Jews went to exile after anti-Roman uprisings in I-II century. Arabs conquered Palestine in 7th century. They were also tolerant to remaining Jews. Nonetheless we are talking about events that are separated by centuries, different times, different actors.

Sure, but please don't speak about things you do not know.

&gt;Interesting that you didn't offer a counterpoint, while clearly being offended.

&gt;Why not offer your view? I'm all ears.

Not offended, just cringed. I also don't want to be discussing Azerbaijani related things on a topic about Yerevan, Mount Ararat, Armenians, Europe, etc.

Anyways, our ethnic ancestors were from the Aral Sea (today's Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan), they migrated to the Caucasus region a 1,000 years ago. Culturally speaking we aren't that close with Central Asian Turks. We have many similarities with Persians/Iranians, but we are primarily Caucasian culturally wise. Our culture is closest with Lezgin and Talysh ethnic groups. There is quite a difference between Azerbaijani and Persian cultures, but from an outside perspective I agree there are many similarities as well... These similarities aren't only unique to Azerbaijan though. Georgia and Armenia have been highly influenced by Iranic/Persian culture as well, especially Armenia.

Ethnically speaking, we are a mix as well. Azerbaijanis are in between Abkhazians and Iranians, but are nearer to Kurds for example. Here is my genetic result plotted on a PCA chart: https://i.imgur.com/q5soYt7.png 

&gt;And geographically are bordering the Asian side of Turkey, as well as Iran.

This comment the most confuses me. Azerbaijan is only bordered with Turkia via Nakhchivan. Here is a map of the Caucasus: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fa/34/6d/fa346dabb09bd0c9a44e9eca83828b4f.png - seems like you were describing Armenia to me considering Armenia has a larger border with Turkey while Azerbaijan has a larger border with Iran.

1783,"&gt;It leads to the EU waiting until Serbia and Montenegro sober up and truly decide for Europe, democracy, rule of law and human rights. At the moment, the impression is that Serbs and Montenegrins are being opportunist, they know there is no money to be had from Russia, so they want to milk the EU, pretending to reform a little bit while everything remains the same. This is not what the EU is about.

All the while the people grow less and less interested in the EU, cause it's not really offering them enough while supporting the assholes in power. 

There's nothing opportunist here, the EU isn't offering enough for the people to be fully interested in it and ditch Russia. If the EU wants more support here it'll have to change, mainly in relations to its stance on Kosovo and its support for Vučić.

&gt;So, the EU waits, for people to get it and go for democracy. If they don't, the EU will wait some more and nothing good will come to Serbia or Montenegro from anywhere else. If you want to do another cycle of Russian destruction, do so. If you would like a cycle of Chinese exploitation, do so. The EU will wait and explain.

It's hard to go for democracy when the people in power work so hard against it and you have little outside support. Slobo fell largely cause outside forces wanted him gone, yet those same forces today support Vučić. I'm of course talking about the West here. Russia's really the only one those against Vučko could turn to though the Russians seem rather hesitant to do anything here right now, which isn't surprising, Vučko  is still keeping good relations with them cause he has to in order to not piss off the entire country, and while a change could work in their favor it's still risky.

&gt;Maybe the EU could cause a fall of leadership, but it would not lead to Serbia or Montenegro moving in the direction of Europe, it would push them to Russia or China. Why would they want to do that?

Why You ask? So the values they propagate can stop being stomped into the ground and to help the people. But of course, that's assuming the EU cared about said values, which as I said, it doesn't. It cares about control, and having a friendly dictator in charge is perfect for that. Which is why they support them.",Rep.

1845,"Agreed in many ways, I'd definitely be in favour of ensuring better animal conditions rather than industrialised breeding and slaughter, and also increased reduction in the consumption of meat - which I consider to be better suited as minor luxury, to be used conservatively across multiple meals in order to minimize wastage and overindulgence.

I would however emphasise again the main point, in that we cannot end the suffering of animals even if we leave them alone in the wild. Most creatures in general are unlikely to survive their first winter, because nature is not a forgiving mistress, and only the hardiest and most prepared will survive two or three. In some ways, the wilds treatment of animals could be said to be worse than ours, at least with human oversight there is daily consistency. However that's beside the point, I feel our job is less the erasure of suffering - because it's mostly a fact of existence - but instead ensuring its minimisation, and making sure we make the most of the animals we've killed. I feel both latter points have been ignored in today's society, which has instead focused to the detriment of both on sating an excessive and unbalanced lifestyle. People who push hard in the opposite direction are often rightfully disgusted in the latter, but their solutions come with grave consequences for animals as much as the opposite did - for example freeing the mink from mink farms on a local level causes massive ecological devastation, because despite being cute, they're adept instinctual killers - and often leads to run on consequences that just assist current environmental damage - such as the fake fur argument, because using the run off from petro-chemicals are not going to do anything good for the environment either, and may end up harming it even more than current animal exploitation in the long run. 

Regardless, the key I feel is more achieving a balance of sorts in favour of minimising the broad impact we cause. We can't end all suffering because even in a world that went fully vegan - ignoring the difficulties in establishing that - we'd still have to trap and kill animals, making them suffer in the process - because how else are we supposed to protect our own food supplies from determined hungry pests and unwanted interlopers? Or for that matter, what do we do with the masses of domesticated animals in such an eventually? The only reasonable solution in my mind is the minimisation approach, moderation is more realistic and likely to be put into place than a radical opposite.

1848,"I don't think those statements are different.

&gt; As for your point I'd like to see a source that isn't trash like the Guardian as I might have missed it.

Churchill's war in Russia isn't a secret. 

&gt; Because an enemy who has perpetrated every conceivable barbarity is at present unable, through his ignorance, to manufacture poisoned gas, is that any reason why our troops should be prevented from taking full advantage of their weapons? The use of these gas shell[s] having become universal during the great war, I consider that we are fully entitled to use them against anyone pending the general review of the laws of war which no doubt will follow the Peace Conference.

He said. But again, he also once thought of letting Bolsheviks to be if they re-enter the war... 

For the usage of poison gas against Ottomans, that's no secret either. He set up a committee for research of the gas usage in the war, and advocated for usage of poison gas in Gallipoli. You can even find it in BBC articles. Good that others haven't followed him.

Again, his thoughts and advocations aren't the things that makes him problematic. Issue is what he did in Kenya, Bengal, Ireland, Greece, etc. His advocations are things just making him seem even worse.

1849,"Iain McNab has been mayor of the municipality of Brunsmark in Schleswig-Holstein since 2008. He is elected until 2023, but when the Brexit arrives, the Scot has to resign immediately.


At the end of the seventies Iain McNab left his Scottish homeland and came to Hamburg. At that time he didn't speak a word of German, earned his living as a sound engineer and found the North Germans a little unfriendly. He now lives with his wife and children in the 160-strong community of Brunsmark in Schleswig-Holstein, where he has been honorary mayor since 2008. His German sounds almost accent-free. He studied in pubs and not in a language school, as he says himself. And people have also become increasingly friendly in recent years.

Only one thing worries the 69-year-old Scotsman: Britain's imminent withdrawal from the EU.

Once the Brexit has been completed, McNab becomes a resident of a non-EU country from one day to the next. However, citizens from so-called third countries are not allowed to be mayors in Germany. Last December McNab received a letter from the Schleswig-Holstein authorities. ""Brexit: Eligibility requirements for local elections"" is the subject of the letter officially informing the Scotsman that he will have to resign on 29 March 2019. However, the timetable has changed a little since then.

After Great Britain and the EU agreed a few weeks ago on an extension of the Brexit deadline, McNab can also stay in office longer. However, he was not quite sure. ""I called the authorities again at the end of March and asked if I had to hand in my key on the 29th,"" he says with a smile. But he doesn't really feel like laughing. Especially as it is still unclear how Brexit will continue.

1863,"&gt;News article please. Your footage shows exactly 1 kid

The media is biased in favour of the chosen EU elite. I don't know why you actually expect things like this to make a big fuss in social media?
The video clearly shows several children running away and the tear gas is on a fair with active rides, so clearly there were people there. Obviously kids are the main demographic of fun fairs. What are you trying to achieve with these ridiculous standards of proof? They teargassed an active fun fair.

&gt;Then don't put dictators and Macron in one sentence if it upsets you when someone questions those comparisons.

Don't make me think even less of your dishonest debating tactics. Implying emotional overreaction is such a weak play  ('if u get upset xD').
You either lack reading comprehension or deliberately twist words to be in your favour. Weak.

&gt;The police can also use violence if others are in danger, and rioters setting fire to stuff and looting is exactly that.

Yes, like beating the elderly, beating up people who are handcuffed, beating up people standing to the side and looking around. Teargassing kids on funfairs. Gotta neutralize the most dangerous threats first, of course!

&gt;picking up a gas grenade with some explosives in it, and a police officer shooting to kill.

I didn't even say French police shoot to kill, I said if you support indiscriminate police violence you directly also agree with police shooting to kill. I genuinely wonder if you are just this lacking in comprehensive reading or if you intentionally twist my words.

&gt;Also, your earlier comments suggest you don't even know who the protesters are in the specific situation this thread is 

BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER. IF YOU ONLY GET UPSET OVER FUCKING KIDS BEING TEARGASSED IF THE PROTESTERS HAPPEN TO BE PEOPLE YOU IDEOLOGICALLY SUPPORT YOU ARE AN IDIOT.

1868,"Precisely. That is the thing. 

The first time I heard about press lying and only casting a negative image, was when I came across some tapes of germans around 1940. And then again in the GDR, when the newspapers called everything coming from the west bad and false. 

And from that point onwards, I exclusively heard this term used by the far right to describe uncomfortable journalists that maybe were not very kind to their preferred political propaganda. 

Thus, for me, fake news and such used to be a nice concept, untill they admitted that they had no intention what so ever to apply that to the parteitreuen news outlets, only to the news outlets critical of the party. 

Independant verification? score keeping? OOh, I kind of wanted that, to be honest, just because it appealed to my german sensibilities, to have an official record, that you can check and countercheck. To take all those bloggers suddenly writing for news outlets, and presenting masses of spin, and to hold them accountable for when their spin failed. IF you have a handfull of bloggers write articles for you, that are mostly spin, well, schucks, can't be mad at you, because my regional supermarket newspaper does the same, and they had a 2 page article about humorously shaped vegetables. But if you fill your newspaper with 90 % bloggers, you should be tested for accuracy. Author by author. And as long as the authors are employed at your newspaper, and continue to write for you, their fakeness rating calculates into your overall rating. 

Surprise, it was never the plan to apply the standard equally to everybody. It was never thought to elevate the entire process, to give journalism a new measuring stick, something to strive and train for, the only thing that was wanted was ""Okay, we have things we don't like, how can we talk smack about them"". 

And the second Trump began using the same damn term, Oh, the big old crocodile tears started rolling. How dare you call us fake news, we are CNN, we represent the world, if you call us fake news you lower the trust of the people in the media, ect.... 

The journalist ethic was thrown out of the window, when suddenly, all the newspapers owned by the biggest donors threw their flags out of the window, and we had discussions about ""A newspaper CAN support a candidate for presidency"" and ""It's not gleichschaltung if our boss does it to support his party""

And here I stand, all alone, with my idealism flag on half mast, and going ""but I thought... we were going to compare.... truthfullness.... Journalism.... doesn't that mean anything to you people anymore?""

Again, that's not an excuse. Britain was the empire ruling Bengal, used scorched earth tactics and screwed the region in that sense. They were responsible to find a way, with Japan being present as well. Yet, again, as many historians say, he and his cabinet haven't cared much about Bengal and haven't prioritised the issue, with or without the Japanese thread and barred anyone to sent help. Sure, ships being sunk should be a risk to take.

And, here comes the thing: I'm not inclined to answer your every question...

1943,"Nah it really is not. Trump can only be president for a max of 8 years and given his unpopularity I wouldn’t be surprised if he becomes a one term president, while the implications of brexit are permanent. With there being no proper procedure of dealing with such a thing to begin with so we ended up with a rather flawed referendum with one option ill-defined and the possibility of going on to the most restrictive trade terms with a close neighbor imaginable, in a weeks time just because parliament can not agree on anything. I also think that brexit is quite regressive especially in a world where countries are increasingly coming closer together and geographical might is more important than ever. Certainly a lot of it is due to harking back to a time, that didn’t really exist. The UK is also not a minor member of the EU but the 2nd or 3rd (depending on how you want to measure France) largest member of that organisation so it would actually change quite a lot for both the UK and the EU from where things have gone previously.

A whole generation is certainly being fucked over with brexit given that 70% of 18-25 year olds didn’t want this thing in the first place and there was around a 64% turnout for that group before someone claims that they didn’t vote. With support for brexit being pretty well correlated with age. Such a decision is going to impact the group that didn’t want it to begin with the hardest and with it goes many of the opportunities that were available before. Trump also hasn’t done that much in office despite his bragging and some of the things that he get criticised for also happened under Obama. Never mind that a Democratic candidate would just run on a platform opposed to it. 

As for climate change it isn’t just an issue for Trump but the Republican Party in general have a pretty terrible record on accepting climate change and the Democratic Party are not that effective on this issue. Therefore it isn’t just him at fault and there have been much action taken on a local level to make up for it with many committing to abide by the Paris agreement regardless. Brexit would also put the UK in a worse position to deal with the issue not only is the UK government tied up with dealing with the issue but the best climate action is on a large scale and that is something that the EU is in a better position to deal with it so brexit is pretty bad in that regard to.

* Denmark 1992: After the first vote, the Danish obtained the Edinburgh Agreement, a list of 4 amendments on the Maastricht Treaty creating opt-outs for Denmark. These concerned Citizenship, the Economic and Monetary Union, Defence policy and Justice and home affairs. The amended treaty was adopted via referendum by 56% in 1993.
* Denmark 2000: Denmark refused to join the euro and that was accepted
* Ireland 2001: After the first vote, the Irish obtained the Seville Declaration which clarified that the Nice Treaty didn't affect of threaten the Irish neutrality. After that, the treaty was adopted via referendum by 62% in 2002.
* Sweden 2003: Sweden refused to join the euro and that was accepted
* France and Netherlands 2005: Here is where you get into fake news territory: France and the Netherlands both refused the European Constitution. The project was thus scrapped.
* Ireland 2008: After the fist vote, the Irish obtained that the system of 1 Commissioner per country was kept and legally-binding guarantees on abortion, taxation and military neutrality. After that, the treaty was adopted by referendum by 67%
* Greece 2015: This one is complicated. The ground for holding a referendum on this is weak at best (Greek Constitution normally forbids referenda on fiscal matters) and the fact that the subject of the referendum was an agreement to bail Greece out negotiated by the Greek government but not supported by him made matters worse. In the end the deal was scrapped but another had to be negotiated before Greece was declared bankrupt and it ended up containing worse conditions for the Greeks... This is a magnificent example of politicians trying to use the people as a scapegoat to avoid assuming their responsibilities and brilliantly backfiring in the face of everyone. This lead to a vote in the Parliament (adopting the new deal) and a snap election which the Prime Minister in place narrowly won.

In all those cases, the results of the referendum were respected and either the treaties were amended or the deals renegotiated...",,/r/europe/comments/bag2zh/eu_fanatics_wondering_why_the_uk_voted_for_brexit/ekbaacs/,loicvanderwiel,1554645590

2042,"&gt; We haven't left the EU yet.

You think it's going to get better?

&gt;Brexit voters don't want the UK to be a superpower, but rather a normal independent country like some of our favourite countries, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. 

In international politics you have two choices: Either exert influence, or have influence exerted upon you. Our favourite countries are doing fine, because the countries exerting their influence upon them  are somewhat benevolent and their interests and values align(UK, EU, US, Japan). That doesn't have to stay that way, especially with a rising China and maybe a more politically unstabe US.

I'd rather be living in the country that has the power to exert it's influence according to it's values and defend itself against foreign influence and values I disagree with. I can influence (to a small extent) the politics of my country and align it closer according to my values. I can't influence the politics of other countries and if mine is not influential enough the political influence of foreign countries diminishes mine.

So in order to protect my influence, I need the EU to stand united.

&gt; The EU isn't going to have the world's second largest GDP, regardless. It's share of world GDP is forecast (OECD) to fall to 9% by 2060, compared with 28% for China and 16% for the USA. Even a fully federal EU will be second-rate power in the future.

Actually it's a fairly good example of how we talk about groups of people that committed crimes in the past. There is always differentiation to today's populations.

This is done out of respect - and historical precision, since it would be oversimplifying to call the Third Reich ""Germany"" or all Germans Nazis, concepts that overlap of course, but are not equal (""Deutsches Reich"" =! ""Deutschland"", in English they are less distinct, but the countries really did have different names). The Nazis/Germans of back then wouldn't call themselves Germans in today's sense, we wouldn't call ourselves Germans in their sense. From a strictly factual standpoint you would actually be more wrong if you'd group the two together.

Maybe it is important to you that Germans feel bad about the holocaust. We do, man. But if we refuse to differentiate between today's generation and the Nazis, all that will cause is a defensive response, more hostility and grist to the mills of the alt-right that fight for the little national pride Germans have today.

The EU has no obligation to be generous to UK, the point of negotiation is to reach a best deal for both sides by each side negotiating a best position for themselves, up until the point the other side refuses to concede further (I really shouldn't have to explain this to an adult). The fact that the UK is in a worse position to negotiate is UK's own fault and a consequence of negotiating with a much bigger economy, and was obvious from the start to anyone, except perhaps to the people that have eaten up the propaganda from the Brexit campaign.

In Egypt alone, it's been made compatible with western liberalism (there's loads of westernized liberal muslims there), socialism (the Nasser era, there's still a lot of those around) and just plain old-school nationalism. 

ISIS-style extreme islamism tends to have a lot in common with fascism. ISIS was basically a fascist state with religion rather than ethnicity as its driving force. You had a ton of different ethnicities from around the world go to Syria to unite around the idea of killing all the unbelievers and creating an ultra-authoritarian state meant to enforce and promote their very authoritarianism-friendly interpretation of Islam.

2149,"Do you really want to know what I think beyond a half-joking summary?

On the summary, you don't see that as analogous to the exit deal May has tried to broker?

You want to leave, and I certainly support your right to self-determination. However, the way your muppets have gone about this process is, frankly, probably one of the worst attempts at British deal-making in the last 500 years. 

Not only is there no natural leverage to aid in a deal, but their obstinate hubris has led them to not even prepare a real plan B. Whatever their and your opinion of Trump as a person and leader is, in a position with zero leverage with the EU, and trying to broker a deal, basic ""any port in a storm"" logic would suggest to have at least made some progress in a potential trade deal with the USA (or another) - which will still be there after Trump. That potential deal alone could be used as leverage to get a better deal from the EU - and if that didn't work, a life raft.

At this point, should Brexit actually occur, and not be endlessly postponed, I expect it will be hard. I expect a no deal - but worse, no *other deal* in the pipeline either! What madness is that?!

I actually agree the EU is fairly fundamentally flawed. The biggest flaw of all is that it's a monetary union but not a fiscal union. 

Perhaps a release valve would be to restore national central banks, which would certainly help the deadbeats like Greece, but I doubt the leadership would try that. It looks more like they'll try to federalise to fix it - as if more centralisation of power ever solved anything. 

But other flaws are becoming apparent that would make that probably untenable for many countries. Scope creep from the original trade area to an almost-but-not-quite federation appears to have usurped sovereignty to the point that there's growing backlash. Brexit was the first, but Brussels is now notably resorting to blackmailing members over their immigration stances. That shit's not going to fly for long. It looks like France is at least in part responding to their own EU pressures now. They haven't yet elected a Frexiteer, but it looks like a matter of time.

The third Roman Empire looks like it will probably crumble in the long run. It's a fair weather system. It works fairly well until it rains. I'd personally suggest cutting some limbs off to save the host - by dropping back to the original trade treaties, and abandoning most of the others that are causing backlash. I don't see anyone in Brussels willing to roll back their experiment though. They've got too much personally invested in it working and they'll keep tightening their grip, and having the water of the consent of the governed slip through their fingers.

As for me thinking that maybe it's me that's wrong, well, you've already made one fundamental wrong assumption. I'm Aussie. I'm a *disinterested* observer (ie no skin in the game) with an opinion of how the game looks to be unfolding.

From here, it looks like all the leaders are arrogant assholes who think they know best on all sides of every fence.

2220,"I think this is as accurate as it is sad. I have a few Anglo-Dutch friends living in the UK. My Dutch friend moved over from Utrecht to Liverpool some 25 years ago started his lovely Anglo-Dutch family. They have been living a nice life and contribute to their local comunity. All good. For the past couple of years they have been thrown into uncertainty about what their lives will look like after Brexit. And I can't imagine that that is what all those voters had in mind when they decided to cast their vote to leave the EU. It seems very clear now that the UK voters had no idea what they were getting themselves into when they bought the concept of that it would only be the taking back of some fictional control idea and everyone would suddenly become rich and happy. Because that's what British pride does apparently: it makes the uninformed vunarable to ideas that may not be in their best interests.   
What that cartoon shows, to my opinion, is how tired and sad the whole situation has become. It shows how the UK is unable to make up it's mind on how to move forward. I think it shows that the UK, somewhere deepdown, knows that the most favorable way ahead would be to call it all off and not leave at all. But I also think that at this point their island stubborness will keep them from making that logical decicion. Keep calm and carry on...  
Noone in the EU (ok maybe a few) will think any less of the UK if they were to remain in the EU.

2269,"&gt; The EU central government is pretty much forcing the UK to stay rather than working out a deal that mutually benefits both states.

EU doesn't have a central government. It's also not a state.

&gt; As an American this looks a lot like the EU is a super country rather than a confederation which is exactly why the UK wants to leave. 

EU has some hard lines that it has made clear from the start, like no freedom of movement = no common market.

It also has a duty to protect it's remaining members, in this case most importantly Ireland, with it's rather 'troubled' land border with the UK in Northern Ireland. The right to move freely across that border was a major part in ending 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland and ending freedom of movement of goods and people could cause major upheaval there (and by some accounts directly goes against the Good Friday agreement that ended the conflict). Additionally, Ireland does a lot of trade with the UK so it's important for them to keep the border as frictionless as possible. Due to all this, Ireland was effectively given a veto in the negotiations. However, as Theresa May torpedoed her majority before starting the negotiations, she has to rely on a Northern Irish party called the DUP to prop up her own to get anything through parliament, who are opposed to anything that could make Northern Ireland further from the UK and closer to Ireland. 

There's a bunch of other reasons as well why a deal is so problematic to come to, and most of them are down to the UK rather than the EU - basically UK misjudged it's starting position to be a lot stronger than it is and has been internally too divided to have a good position at the table - if they can't even decide what they want, how is the EU supposed to know?

2341,"&gt;In Netherlands they just won the elections for Senate 

Indeed they did. The NL is certainly an exception to the current trend

&gt;and in Italy Lega is polling as largest party.

Indeed it is, however Italy is following the same trend as much of Europe: populist stagnation or decline. The image below shows this

https://i.imgur.com/mc9RgHy.png

Lega peaked in September 2018 at 32%. They still have 32%. However, the other populist party - M5S - has fallen from 29% to 21% while PD has now exceeded its 2018 general election result

&gt;In France you now have basically a 2 party system with the extreme against the centre. 

France doesn't worry me: the 2nd round system hopefully neuters any threat from the extreme. The decline of the populist right can be observed in France too - in the EP election polling. National Rally has dropped from 25% to 21% and they will be overtaken as the largest French party in the European parliament by La République En Marche

&gt;In other countries they are holding their gains and waiting for the crisis and correct moment to advance.

All parties are waiting for the correct moment to advance. If its their intention to hold their gains though, they aren't doing a very good job at it

AfD: 18% to 11%

Vox: 13% to 9%

FPO: 26% to 23%

DPP: 21% to 14%

RN: 25% to 21%

I'm not saying you are wrong, but I would like to add a point. I think that what you say is part right but not most of the answer. One could easily say that the brits just messed up and ""our party"" would learn from that and do it right. The real reason I think they abandoned the idea is because Brexit forced people to think about how they would do it different and basically found out that leaving EU sucks, and here's why...  


Many are anti EU for two reasons, they don't like losing national sovereignty and/or don't like the way EU functions (socialists usually mind the neoliberal side of EU, for example). 

The problem with losing national sovereignty is that EU is not the cause for this, even if it may seem like it when more and more functions move from national level to EU level. The way I see it, the EU doesn't really ""take"" control, they are given it because it's already slipping from national control. EU is a way to handle globalisation and not something causing it. This is to say, leaving EU does not give back control over your nation.

What can do instead is to try change EU into your liking, wich is exactly what these right wing parties say they want to do, change it from the inside. This will be true as long as the state of EU is not seen as worse that standing outside EU.

If the UK plans to go back below those standards (as we already see the US pressuring the UK to do to secure new trade agreements) the EU will be forced to enforce their market acesss via customs and borders.

At the same time, as i understand it, one of the main motivations for leave voters was to restrict freedom of movement from the continent (something the UK could've *already* done more within the EU frame, if they didn't *need* that cheap immigration labor to keep their health care system running, among others).

Farage and his lot used a poster made from a picture of refugees on the Croatian-Slovenian border to imply that, due to the refugee crisis, millions of these refugees would be forced into Britain by the EU.  That was untrue.  In fact, all Britain had agreed to do was resettle a total of 20,000 Syrian refugees - by 2020.  Total asylum applications, measured per 100,000 population, were well under the EU average - in 2015, it was 60 in the UK, 260 in the rest of the EU.  And, if that weren't enough, under EU rules, granting or refusing asylum is actually something the UK has control over, so Brexit is actually completely and totally irrelevant to that issue.

2416,"Having pushed the button on Article 50 the UK is out after the 2 years are gone, plus any delays the EU is willing to grant.

The default state is that if nothing else happens, the UK leaves with no deal. It doesn't matter whether parliament votes against no deal, unless they also revoke Article 50 and simple cancel Brexit (which a European court already decided they are free to do).

The EU has no reason to agree to major changes to the The Deal.
They have no interest in making any exits easy and fun and also, any deal involves the agreement of all member states. There are political and practical limits to such changes.

Also there are practical and political reasons that make further delays ever harder. There are European elections coming up and the Budget planning.
It would be very awkward to have the UK participate in an election and send MEPs while in the process of leaving. And being part of the budget planning and commitment for the next few years is pretty much out if the question.

At the moment a hard NoDeal Brexit seems likely (no doubt followed by a flurry of panicky negotiations and agreements).

The only alternatives are to either cancel Brexit or vote for the godamn unloved Deal at the last-minute after some procedural fudging when MPs realize that shit is about to hit the wall and that all the alternatives turned out to be fantasies.

There are still leave MPs who argue that the EU will cave on everything at the last minute, because reasons (those dudes live in some fantasy world, or still haven't quite realized that the empire is no more).
And then there are of course MPs who argue that a hard Brexit will be no big deal. And all the bad consequences are just naysayers who fell for ""Project Fear"".

Russia can supply anything it wants by functioning railways and by trucks through 100%-controlled straight to Donetsk and Lugansk. Control over the border between Russia and Ukraine - this is what does have absolute strategic value.

&gt; I mean, the British people voted themselves out, the only thing stopping it from happening is political corruption between the EU and British MP's? 

They put May in charge of the negotiations, who was a remainer, and she completely shat the bed. Her “deal” is to essentially remain in the EU and give up all voting powers Britain has in the EU. Anyone with common sense can see that this is a deal NOBODY is happy with.

The EU is going to wage economic warfare on Britain if they leave. They absolutely cannot let Britain have a win on this, or other countries may consider leaving. They have no reason to make this easy on Britain, and every reason to make them miserable.

2534,"&gt;I would never consider going 'muh antebellum architecture &gt;:(' for a before/after picture of a mansion left in ruins from slave revolt and liberation and if someone should do just that I would think it disgusting if the commentors were saying garbage like 'anything the blacks touch turns to shit' as a response that gets so highly upvoted here if you only put 'Russians' in that slot.

The issue we were discussing is collective punishment and how that would apply to Americans, not the inevitable angry racism these threads brings out in people. And let me just point out that you seem prone to the same sweeping generalizations when it comes to talking about the Germans. We are living in times where it seems that the average voter barely can locate their own ass using both hands, but the ""well educated German voters"" in a time well before television and the internet before the advent of radio and propaganda were apparently all 
super well informed on the militaristic expansion plans 6+ years down the road of a party that, contrary to your ""top three points"" the Nazis got elected mostly on the economic fallout of the great depression. Uniting all Germans is not malevolent in and of itself and neither is rejecting (perceived) unjust punishment of the treaty of versailles. If such a rejection included revisionist demands on the German territory lost in 1918 that still is nowhere even remotely close to ""expect us to start a world war and a couple of genocides"".

&gt;you don't need to provide such excuses that they didn't realize the frickin' Nazis were aggressively expansionist militarists with eyes on getting land from the so-called 'Judeo-Bolsheviks' they were always harping about in the east.

Indeed I don't, because such a claim with 85 years of hindsight is so ridiculous that it hardly deserves a response, let alone excuses. 

&gt;There's a bigger picture here and focusing on whining about that particular loss which is so insignificant in the grand scheme of that war would be petty and ridiculous.

Yes, and the bigger picture is that it is absolutely possible for victims to exist on both sides of a conflict, and that it is perfectly possible and reasonable to feel compassion for them without condoning the crimes of their countrymen.",,/r/europe/comments/b9ws3s/a_city_that_ceased_to_be_königsberg_east_prussia/ekaemvu/,Monsi_ggnore,1554603432
2535,"Economically seen brexit is a lose lose situation for both, without a deal britain just gets absolutley fucked, because every contract that is EU related is not apllied anymore at the moment britain leaves.  
And the only reason britain is still in the EU at this point is the british parliament, the EU can't tell them that they are not allowed to leave (after 29.3.2019).  
The parliament, at this point, is unhappy with all possible outcomes because they know it will fuck them and they still hope they get a better deal but at the sime time EU holds way more leverage as it won't be that much of a problem compared to all the british people.

I would agree with your in a normal market. Based on the experience (not just in Berlin) thats not the case anymore. The RoI in five to ten years for an empty flat is good enough without the pain to bring yourself in the position to become a landlord in Germany and obey the laws for this position.

I'd never heard of this happening, but apparently, this has happened once before to a US fighter being flown by a test pilot in 1956:

https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/a27967/the-fighter-plane-that-shot-itself-down/

&gt;In 1956, the Grumman aircraft corporation was testing its new fighter, the F-11 Tiger, off the coast of New York state. The pilot fired a long burst from its guns and moments later suffered mysterious, catastrophic damage that caved in the windshield and mortally wounded the engine. What happened? The pilot had shot himself down.
&gt;
&gt;The F-11 Tiger, like all Grumman aircraft, was named after a cat. Fast and nimble, the F-11 was only the second supersonic fighter in the Navy's inventory, capable of 843 miles an hour (Mach 1.1). It was actually Grumman's first supersonic fighter and the company's inexperience with the consequences of supersonic flight, as well as the fighter's amazing speed, would be one test Tiger's undoing.
&gt;
&gt;On September 21st, 1956, as DataGenetics explains, a Grumman test pilot flying a Tiger off the coast of Long Island dropped his nose twenty degrees and pointed it at an empty spot of ocean. He fired a brief, four second burst from his four Colt Mk.12 20-millimeter cannons, entered a steeper descent, and hit the afterburners. A minute later, his windshield suddenly caved in and his engine started making funny noises, eventually conking out as the pilot attempted to return to Grumman's Long Island airfield. 
&gt;
&gt; The test pilot had assumed he had been the victim of a bird strike, but the accident investigation revealed another cause: in his fast descent, the pilot had actually flown into his own stream of 20-millimeter cannon rounds. Although the rounds had a head start (the air speed of the aircraft plus the muzzle velocity of the rounds) they slowed quickly due to drag passing through the surrounding air. The rounds decelerated, the Tiger accelerated, and the two reunited in the sky, with fatal (for the aircraft) consequences. 

http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Tiger138260.htm

&gt; Naval Vice Admiral William V. Davis, deputy chief of naval operations for aviation, told the story of the strange accident at a luncheon talk before the Aviation Writers Association at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, nearly five weeks after the accident.  As a result of the accident, the Navy advised pilots of its fast jets to turn off course or pull up after firing their guns, despite claims by them that it was a ""million-to-one shot.""
&gt;
&gt;But Attridge disagreed. ""At the speeds we're flying today, it could be duplicated any time.""

Yeah funny thing no one is talking about is while AKP lost the municipalities in many cities they haven't actually lost the majority in municipal councils in many of the cities they lost. So they still have some control in the municipalities they lost. Having the council is not as good as having the mayor but it can be used to hinder the mayor.

Don't ask me how that happened because we literally voted for that at the same time we voted for the mayor. It's possible that AKP electors wanted to punish AKP by voting for the other party to lead the municipality but they voted for AKP in the councils anyway.

Personally I don't AKP is expecting to win those cities back with recounts.

2755,"&gt; 2 of these might not support your point. The dyke march is a LGBTQ march, or whichever acronym is the preferred one at the moment, and not an anti-racist one as far as I'm aware. 

Dyke March constantly preaches intersectionality against racism and homophobia. 

&gt; The poster talks about ""jewish privilege"" (that one's new to me) as an aspect of white privilege and COULD be a more or less legit attempt, albeit a pretty fucking crude one, to adress systemic discrimination.

Jews do not make up 9/10ths of the 1%, it's a total lie. It's classic Jews control everything propaganda with a new coat of paint and nothing more.


&gt; Now, I'm not really trying to say that someone who has an official anti-racist position is necessarily tolerant of Jews, but my own limited experience with anti-Israel protesters has given me an impression of a legitimately inclusive group who accepts Jews but regards Israel as an apartheid state. That stance does not neccesarily relfect everybody, but I personally believe it to be fairly common among the anti-Israel camp.

Having a Jew amongst them doesn't really mean anything, having one black friend doesn't mean you can't be a racist.

&gt; As for why someone would spread misinformation, they might be legitimately misinformed. They could have seen TV footage from previous incidents where crowds that were at least seemingly unarmed were fired at and been willing to believe it if someone told them that Israel had shot unarmed civialins again. This is universal for all political positions, people say false stuff absolutely all the time about every topic under the sun but that does not neccesarily mean it is done maliciously. Many of these people really could just not know the truth.

A single search on Wikipedia or even just reading any news site covering the events that isn't Middle East Monitor would have told them that their view of what happened is wrong. Sure, it's possible they're just total fucking morons but it seems an awful more likely that they just refuse to have their minds changed. 

At a certain point we can't make a distinction anymore.

Secondly, do not revert the history, Croatia did not do any ethnic cleansing in the Homeland war. Croatia was attacked. Croatia was seized a right to gain independence and break away from the Socialist Federal Rep. Of Yugoslavia. Croatia was unarmed and with many military bases of JNA loyal to Belgrade all across its territory. Croatia was without any support of the rest of the world because of the Serbian diplomatic actions. Within Croatian territory, with the blessing of official Belgrade, terroristic paramilitary quasi-states were created. Serbia had no intention to condemn or suspend Chetnik movement and their paramilitary units; it openly collaborated with them. Serbia was fighting an open war against first Slovenes, then Croats, Bosniacs and Albanians/Kosovars, each of these a being a weaker victim of this offense, and yet somehow managed to lose each war. That is the truth. Shame goes onto your people, your country and you personally, who tries to defend these actions and revert the facts.

2889,"&gt; Another referendum is the worst case scenario.

No it is not and I don’t particularly like referendums. It is still not a good option but then again none of the others really are. Holding another referendum is certainly better than forcing the UK to crash out on no deal which is what many commentators on here are advocating. For a verity of reasons. Having referendum on the terms which wouldn’t be a straight run up and not the same thing as the last which had the leave option ill-defined. 

&gt;One referendum stating 52-48 leave and another stating 52-48 remain leaves us in exactly the same place as before.

It would change government policy from one trying to implement brexit to one committed to remaining so there clearly would be change. Although, I agree it wouldn’t be that helpful and I think it is better option than now but it would be better off trying to push for an stronger majority, in order to settle the issue. Which I believe would be easier with a clearly defined leave option to gain a more meaningful majority and there has been movement from leave to remain, with no poll with a leave majority since around the last election. 

&gt;The die is cast.

No it hasn’t, the UK isn’t out of the EU and so the option to revoke article 50 is still there.

&gt;The EU must move on without the UK and the sooner that is accomplished

Unfortunately the EU will have to deal with the UK for much longer, the UK is going to want a trade deal especially under no deal as it isn’t really viable long term to have such a restrictive regime on your largest market so we are back to square one. With things like the border, citizen’s rights, the money etc. To ultimately put the UK in a worse place than before and the EU wouldn’t come out of that unscarred. So there is no way it can simply done quickly and just move on like that. 

&gt;The UK can apply for accession in 10 years

There is no time limit for accession a country could leave one day and theoretically join the next day and don’t think it is that unlikely that the UK will rejoin either if it had left.

Cool

I don't know who you're talking about here. You have to be clear, that job is on you.

And that parents considering circumcision for their newborns must have medical necessity.

3012,"&gt;Doubt they learnt new things


Challenge accepted. Let’s look at the best paper I’ve seen on the subject, the Canadian Paediatrics Society’s position paper. In their references they list:


5 publications from 2008.


11 publications from 2009.


4 publications from 2010.


1 publication from 2011.


2 publications from 2012.


2 publications from 2013.


1 publication from 2014.


So that’s a total of **26 publications written since 2008** that the Canadian Paediatrics Society referenced to write their position paper in 2015.


And there’s 3 more publications written in 2007 that we could add depending where you draw the line. So it could be up to 29 publications written since 2007 that the CPS references.


And the point of that was, afaik *that was not their current statement*. The current statement is on the second link:



&gt;efficacious intervention for HIV prevention

Which they do not recommend. So I stand by what I said: not a single medical organization in the world actually recommends circumcision. We can cover more organizations too if you’d like, I like national level reviews.


Not to mention there’s more on HIV that we can cover. Namely that condoms and safe sex education are far more effective. 


&gt;circumcision isn't considered by the WHO as harmful

You missed the point entirely.


The definition of genital mutilation has nothing to do with harm. It is determined by whether or not it’s medically necessary. If it’s not medically necessary, then it’s genital mutilation *by definition*.

&gt;circumcision isn't considered by the WHO as harmful as FGM is.

You miss the point entirely X2. This isn't a harm competition. There is no threshold of harm that has to be met for it to be genital mutilation. It’s defined the way it is so that there can be no inane debate about which alterations are 'harmful enough', and which are 'not harmful enough'. It appropriately eliminates that whole discussion and properly places the standard of proof on medical reasons. Everything outside of medical procedures is genital mutilation by default.


Otherwise this happens:

 

[""it did not mutilate any girl’s genitals, but rather nicked the outer foreskin. ... It is very unfair to classify all of it under the term mutilation""](https://www.wnd.com/2017/11/its-not-genital-mutilation-says-muslim-doctors-lawyer/)

 

[""Does the U.S. Constitution allow for genital cutting, even if it's just a minor nick or scraping"".](https://www.freep.com/story/news/2017/05/21/female-genital-mutilation-religious-freedom/319911001/)

 

[“Dawoodi Bohra women ... assert that it conducts circumcision on its girls which is different and harmless”](https://www.indiatoday.in/pti-feed/story/bohra-womens-group-we-dont-practice-genital-mutilation-1163959-2018-02-06)

 

[“Australian Court Rules Bohra Practice of Female Circumcision is Not Mutilation”](https://www.religiousfreedomnews.com/2018/08/13/australian-court-rules-bohra-practice-of-female-circumcision-is-not-mutilation/)

 

Should we sit on our hands until someone comes up with a double blind study that genital scrapping is harmful? Of course not. So how do we figure out what is permissible and what is not? Simple, if it's not medically necessary we put a stop to it.


Adults can choose whatever they want for their own body, as long as they are told accurate information (see news article above). They can get a tattoo, get a piercing, whatever they want. To decide for someone else, ie a newborn, the standard is medical necessity.

I agree. Slovenia ended up being one of the last places in Europe to be liberated. Militarily, OF was a failure.

However, you have to understand that people back then didn't have the knowledge we have today. They didn't know that the Soviets would stop the Germans at Stalingrad, or that the Americans would join the war. It's easy to look back at their decisions and say that they were wrong.

Also, Nazis/Fascists didn't treat us the same as the French or the Norwegians. We were Slavic untermensch and treated appropriately...

3127,"As with all political ideas, if it's just talk then it is worthless. Norway has not banned ICE vehicles. The 2025 thing is talk. Nothing more.

The price of oil is kept artificially high, it has only begun dropping when the US and Canada started their own oil production from previously unavailable sources. Norway selling less oil will only mean that OPEC can sell more without lowering the prices further. There is, and will continue to be a market for oil and natural gas. If anyone wants to limit greenhouse gas emissions then they should look at replacing fossile fuel power plants with renewable or nuclear ones. Replace gas stoves and heating with electric. And tax ICE engines and subsidise electric ones. Perhaps look at replacing large container ships's fossile fuel engines with nuclear ones.

I don't think there is any point in cutting production when it will not affect the price. It would, in a sense, be virtue signaling when you can instead make greater use of the profits in investing in alternatives. Of course, before this is about investing in alternatives, this is about reducing investment risks. 

I have not read anything you've said as you hating Norway. Every country deserves critisism, and only by accepting it can we improve.

3151,"&gt;Personally speaking I'd use poison gas, but there are alternatives

Again, he wanted to use gas that would cause inconvenience and injury but no permanent effects. That's it. (My thanks to u/naugrith for this). 

Now as for gas during WW2 (thanks to u/mrv3 for this answer).

Churchill was ahead of the time and paranoid of Germany (which is why he opposed appeasement strongly in the 30's) and he was right in doing so.

Now as Germany was entering the final stages of the war they became increasingly desperate and depraved with programs like Werwolf, there was a genuine fear that while not war winning certain 'wonderweapons' might be used by Germany in the final stages as winning became unobtainable.

Germany was reported to have a large amount of poison gas at hand and with V2 could still do damage. Churchill wanted to be prepared for a dark final year of WW2 where Germany used it's most evil weapons for the sole purpose of vengeance. If it came down to it Churchill wanted to be able to respond in an instant brutal as it may be this is also the war that WW2 was.

The first bombings of cities where done by the allies, we look back now and see it was necessary.

Had Germany attacked with a wonder weapons and devastated Britain, France, or Russia Churchill wanted to be ready to strike back and he said as much.
Furthermore, it was a study to be ready in case Germany used it (as Churchill specifically said 'We can muster 20 tons if they use 1' [paraphrasing])

America came up with several plans about invading every NATO country from Iceland to Britain (it's closest and strongest ally). It didn't do this because it was going to invade because it is always better to have a plan and not need it than need a plan and not have it.

Churchill was genuinely terrified of a gas attack on either the troops at D-DAY which had a tenuous hold at best for 2 months or on Britain which was still suffering food shortages. If gas was used and the beachhead lost then that would be disastrous. It'd renew Nazi morale, allow division to be put into Italy and back east causing friction with the Soviets and resulting in more deaths elongating the war and killing millions. Remember every year this war goes on 10,000,000 die and countless millions more in the concentration camps.

Is it wrong to start to consider ending it in a week through gas and saving lives?

3189,"First of all, we must be clear about exactly which gases Churchill is talking about, and when he is talking about them.

Firstly, up to 1944, Churchill’s remarks about poison gases refer solely to lachrymatory poisons. You talk repeatedly about mustard/phosgene gases, as though this is the sole poison gas in use or being referred to. However, up to 1944, Churchill never once suggested the use of these poisons, nor defended their use. Up to that point, he only ever promoted the use of lachrymatory poisons. Yet despite this you assume all of Churchill’s remarks about “using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes” and “the use of gas in Ireland” are referring to mustard/phosgene. This is entirely incorrect.

Indeed the full quotes of Churchill make this abundantly clear. On 12 May 1919, faced with rebellious tribesmen in Iraq, Churchill wrote from the War Office:

“We have definitely adopted the position at the Peace Conference of arguing in favour of the retention of gas as a permanent method of warfare. It is sheer affectation to lacerate a man with the poisonous fragment of a bursting shell and to boggle at **making his eyes water by means of lachrymatory gas**… It is not necessary to use only the most deadly gasses: gasses can be used which cause great inconvenience and would spread a lively terror and yet **would leave no serious permanent effects** on most of those affected.”

As Churchill said in another quote; ""If it is fair war for an Afghan to shoot down a British soldier behind a rock and cut him in pieces as he lies wounded on the ground, why is it not fair for a British artilleryman to fire a shell which **makes the said native sneeze**? It is really too silly.""

Up to 1944 Churchill only ever wrote about the use of **lachrymatory poisons** during war as a humane alternative to explosive munitions. These were a group of non-fatal poisons that were a primitive form of modern tear gas. The specific gases that the British used during the first world war were **xylyl bromide and ethyl bromoacetate**. The physical effects of these were intended to be non-fatal but debilitating – solely causing non-permanent irritation of the eyes and nasal passages so that those affected would be temporarily debilitated by streaming eyes and noses. 

These **lachrymatory poisons** were a completely different group of chemical compounds from the **vesicant poisons**, of which mustard and phosgene were part. Vesicant poisons cause blistering of skin, which prove fatal when breathed into the throat and lungs, and cause blindness when they come into contact with eyes, causing blistering to the area. **Lachrymatory poisons are different** and they do **not** do this.

The actual effects of these lachrymatory poisons when used during WWI combat however were observed to be almost negligible. Unless the weather conditions were absolutely perfect, the poison gas would be dispersed so widely that almost no one was actually physically affected, and those who were affected would receive such a low dose that they would still be physically able to continue in combat. 

The effect of the deployment of the lachrymatory poisons was observed to be primarily, or almost solely psychological in effect, not physical. On completely green troops, who had never experienced gas before, the sight of the drifting clouds would fill them with such primal fear that often units would break and flee the field before the gas hit them. On green troops at the beginning of the war, this was a useful effect. As the war progressed, and the armies became mostly veterans, the use of such poison gas became less efficacious, and was largely abandoned.

The infamous M Devices of the British army were a secret weapon designed to create a special compound of lachrymatory poison that was more physically effective than the largely-useless xylyl bromide and ethyl bromoacetate. The result was diphenylaminechloroarsine, a new compound that was more powerful than the other lachrymatory poisons. However, when it was tested in the Russian Civil War, the effects in the field were almost as pitiful as the xylyl and ethyl compounds. Hardly any of the targets were found to be affected after the deployment. Therefore despite a considerable amount of time and money spent on its development, the M Devices were considered a dead end and quietly abandoned. 

Churchill’s letters proposing the use of gas, far from showing a cold-hearted war criminal, actually show us a picture of a civilian politician too soft-hearted for the realities of war. He continued to promote the use of non-fatal poison gas long past the point at which it had been demonstrated to be almost entirely ineffective. And so his generals ignored him and continued to use the far more effective (and mass-fatality) high-ex bombs instead, rather than listening to the hand-wringing of a civilian who'd seen too much war first-hand as a young man, and had been deeply affected by its horrors.

However, we do then have the remarks from Churchill in summer 1944, which do talk about vesicant gas, principally mustard gas. This was the weakest form of vesicant, far less fatal than chlorine or phosgene. As Churchill himself remarked, it was a form of poison gas “**from which nearly everyone recovers.**” Indeed, despite its fearsome reputation, of 164,612 British mustard gas casualties on the Western front, only 4,086 or **2.5% died**. Chlorine, in comparison, caused casualties of nearly 20%. And still Churchill insisted that he would only order the use of this almost entirely non-fatal mustard gas if “**it was life or death for us**” or if it would “**shorten the war by a year**.” 

But mustard was indeed a vesicant, and would have caused casualties – though still a vast amount **less** than the high-explosive munitions then currently being dropped on civilians all over Europe. Churchill is still clear, even with mustard gas, that he wants to look into its use solely in order to reduce casualties – not increase them. However, we must look into these remarks as they demonstrate a complete U-Turn from British policy up to that point, as well as a change in Churchill’s own prior views on the matter. Of course, we know that Churchill never actually ordered the deployment of this gas even once. But in these letters he does admit he might be willing to use them, or at least consider their use “dispassionately”.

On July 25th 1944 Churchill wrote: “On July 6 I asked for a dispassionate report on the military aspects of threatening to use lethal and corrosive gases on the enemy if they did not stop the use of indiscriminate weapons. I now request this report within three days.” (Prime Minister’s Personal Minute, Serial D.217/4. July 25th, 1944. UK NA: CAB 120-775.) 

The Joint Chiefs had already started the report and submitted it the next day. The report argued against the use of gas, not, as you say - because they were worried about the civilian deaths (this would be a ridiculous concern as we were carpet-bombing cities at the time). The Chiefs of staff actually argued against the use of mustard gas solely on reasons of efficacy – the use of largely non-fatal gas was considered almost wholly ineffective. 

Upon receiving this “dispassionate” and “cold-blooded”, though still negative report, Churchill reluctantly accepted it, though his memo reveals that he retained hope for the future. However, there is no evidence that he ever mentioned the use of mustard (or other vesicant) gas again.

When Britain’s commanders were dropping thousands of tons of 100% fatal high-explosive shells on civilian areas all over Germany, does Churchill’s pushing of an alternative that would cause only 2.5% fatalities seem like such a monstrous crime? I would argue that it is not. Indeed it is part of a pattern of behaviour throughout Churchill’s life in which he was continually looking for ways in which to *reduce* the loss of life and human suffering in war.

It's not that different.

And in both cases there's a big military base involved. Both cases are supported by self-determination but are illegal in all other aspects.

And yes, the Russians argued it was illegal, before Kosovo happened. As they said, that set the precedent, that you can just so recognize secession, that international law truly be damned and that might can make right.

3272,"I would say it's a lazy argument, pointing to the east bloc whenever somebody mentions ""socialism"" or ""communism"".

The east bloc system was quite specific. The way the revolution happened was essentially the opposite of what Marx had imagined. He had thought, after capitalist industrialization, the workers in the most industrialized countries would seize the means of production. But Russia was the least industrialized country in Europe, and the economic model they implemented was essentially a copy of the German war economy during WWI: the government was in total control of the economy, and nobody else had a say. It certainly wasn't ""workers controlling the means of production"".

In the 19th century, the terms ""democracy"" and ""republicanism"" were toxic, because people thought about the Jacobin terror in France. ""Democracy"" was equal to murdering the opposition on the guillotine in the minds of most people. Nowadays, this couldn't be farther from the truth, of course.

In essence, democracy means putting the people in charge of the government instead of just a few powerful individuals. Likewise, socialism means putting the people in charge of the economy instead of just a few powerful individuals. But not every ""democratic"" revolution ends with a democracy in place, and not every ""socialist"" revolution ends up with socialism in place. In fact, violent revolutions are very likely to end with just a new set of powerful individuals on top (because being powerful and violent and cruel helps in any violent conflict).

Now, of course there are some people who call themselves ""socialists"" and still feel the need to somehow defend the east bloc system (just like some people romanticize the Jacobins).

Let me go with a slightly absurd example.

Occasionally there's a ginger working as an administrator or technician or even doctor in a hospital, but that's rare. When you got sick, nurses were gingers too!

When you get older you still want to work in healthcare. You're choosing between being a doctor or a nurse - and if you are really driven and know what you want from life (which is not that common among 18/19 year old people) you will choose the former.

Why is it ok for the poorest 80% to always be the ones that need to bear more tax when the state deems that it requires money, but at the same time the state has no problem getting rid of a very profitable industry (ADP) and cutting taxes for the ultra wealthy that bought in billions for the coffers.

When interviewed by the Guardian newspaper about life in Poland, Maya Mortensen, a women who grew up under communist rule in the 1950s and 60s, commented: “The regime made absolutely no distinction between men and women. I never even thought about the division – all advance in society was open
to men and women equally.”

3462,"**Qwant could pay about one million euros to press publishers in 2019, for consulting their articles on the French search engine.**

The French independent search engine Qwant, ""awaits the Bank Account Information of press publishers"" to pay them, says its boss Eric Léandri, who also proposes to create a decentralized system to easily check who owns the photos published online. In an interview with AFP, the co-founder and president of Qwant thus takes a position on how best to implement the European copyright reform adopted by MEPs at the end of March.

*One million euros for the press in 2019*

This directive, which Member States will have to transpose into national law within two years of publication in the EU's Official Journal, provides for the creation of a ""neighbouring right"" to copyright for the press, so that platforms (Google News, Facebook) pay the media better for the articles they use. ""We had started to implement the payment of the press before the vote,"" says Eric Léandri, for whom the news ""brings the search engine to life"". ""Without the news, our web results are much less relevant,"" he notes.

Qwant intends to apply the same agreement as that concluded with VG Media, the association of newspaper publishers in Germany: 5% of ""web and news"" revenues are transferred to the media concerned. In France, he hopes that the press will organize itself in the same way, but in the meantime, ""we will send ""cheques"" to those who send us their RIB"", starting with the magazine Le Point, which has already done so. Qwant could thus pay about €1 million to newspaper publishers in 2019, if its results prove to be in line with its forecasts.

""If Google applies the same thing, it will owe 150 to 200 million a year to the French press,"" says Eric Léandri. Since 2015, as part of its Digital News initiative (DNI), Google has been allocating funds to press titles selected through annual calls for proposals, including on ""diversification of revenue sources"". In March, its media fund redistributed a total of €25.6 million in Europe, including nearly €6.6 million in France.

*A ""basket"" to authenticate content* 

Éric Léandri also intends to take advantage of the European reform to propose a solution that meets the current challenges of intellectual property remuneration. Qwant has created a digital and decentralized ""basket"", which is intended to be used by content owners (photos, texts, videos, music...), to ""deposit"" them, and by sites that publish content, to authenticate them at the time of publication. ""Neither the web giants nor anyone else will be able to say: We couldn't verify who this photo belonged to,"" says the search engine manager.

This solution, which it intends to make available to the players concerned in the near future, is in opposition to filter technologies such as Google's ""Content ID"", which is used on its subsidiary YouTube to recognize videos and identify copyright infringements. Internet freedom advocates associate these filters with some form of censorship. ""We want to reverse the problem: instead of putting filters on the sites, we give a place where we can verify that it doesn't belong to anyone else,"" argues Eric Léandri, who says he wants to avoid ""total control of the web by the big platforms"".

&gt;In his TEDx Talk, Isaiah Lopaz reflects on institutional and everyday racism as he experiences it as a Black, gay, migrant in Germany, a country where many believe that because of their past, they have learned how to deal with and therefore avert racism.  Isaiah Lopaz is a writer and an artist who was born in Los Angeles in 1979. Through collage, photography, and “curated conversations”, his work explores race and racism, African and Afro-Diasporic histories, and the lived experiences of people who identify as both Black and Queer. He currently lives in Berlin and is hard at work on a film titled ""A History of Remembering"".

While Srpska signed away the right to independence when they adopted the Dayton Agreement as the institution and the Dayton agreement line 1 sates none of the two entities will harm the the integrity of Bosnia as a Nation.

Croats may have an uneasy relationship with Bosniaks but the last thing Croats do is partner up with Serbs even hard-line Croats in Bosnia who want there own state refused to form a government with Serb parties.

Also Bosnia is 4th with immigration 1st:Bulgaria 2nd:Moldova 3rd:Kosovo 4th: Bosnia 5th:Serbia

Kudos for such honesty in assessing the situation. Don't take my word for it, though, take it from the folks who did the accounting:

&gt; So, altogether, direct **US expenses on defence in Europe are estimated to range between US$30.7bn in 2017 and US$36.0bn in 2018, or between 5.1% and 5.5% of the total US defence budget**, as measured by the IISS.

RAF Bomber Command estimated that 20% of industry and 41% of all the housing in Königsberg was destroyed. Out of a force of 189 Lancasters, German night fighters shot down 15 RAF bombers.[8] The historic city centre suffered severe damage and the districts of Altstadt, Löbenicht, and Kneiphof were nearly destroyed. The city's 14th-century cathedral was reduced to a shell. Extensive damage was also done to the castle, all churches in the old city, the university, and the old shipping quarter.

&gt;In 1945, the prolonged battle of Königsberg inflicted further damage. When the Soviets occupied the city in April 1945, more than 90% of the city was already destroyed. Under Soviet occupation, the surviving, much reduced German population was forcibly expelled from the city.

3837,"We entered NATO before the EU. Never in our history has Romania looked to the east. That's where all our enemies have come from: the Hungarians (who settled west), the Turks, the Russians, the Mongols, the Tartar, etc ad nauseam.

Unlike the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine (and the Baltics and others) Romania has no Russians. We don't have 5th column citizens.

How can you possibly say that we'd be sympathetic to the Russians? We literally let Americans bomb the Serbs (our friends) from our territory just to get the possibility of maybe entering NATO. Once in, we tried to get them to build as many bases as possible and add as many rockets as possible and fly in any victims they like to torture on our land as much as possible. All of this because we want nothing to do with Russia (unlike how the Irish want to be friends with the British).

But it looks to me like you've failed to explain how Romania (in NATO) would become a Russian satellite.

You read some WW2 book and you think you understand Romania. Even the communists in Romania were anti Russia. Ceaușescu (the hardest communist since Stalin) was a staunch opponent of Russia and was the only commie leader to condemn the invasion of Czechoslovakia. The most scenic mountain road in Romania wasn't built for touristic purposes, it was build to help move units in the case of a similar invasion by the Russian-aligned communist states.

3868,"Maybe in some random speeches - but I've seen American (and other Western European) maps between 1945 and 1991, which clearly showed everything between Poland and Finland as red. In any case - recognition matters very little in real life. England hasn't recognised France as a fully independent state until the 20th century (100-year-war legacy), and its superpower status certainly doesn't make anyone question the existence of Ancient Regime France. Revolutionary France wasn't recognised by *anyone at all.* And?..

It's the matter of something else entirely: whether the controlling power annexes the territory, therefore treating it and its citizens the same as its ""original"" ones, or it continues to occupy it without formally extending its laws there. The example of the latter are fairly rare outside of actual warfare: Israel in Gaza/West Bank is literally the only long-term case that comes to mind. All the other things were full-blown annexations, regardless of how anyone else feels about them - unless they're willing to go to war to remedy the situation, that is.

Recognising independence of certain places does actually matter, because it affects diplomatic/trade and other relations throughout the world. Recognising ""legality"" of annexations, though, doesn't affect anything at all. Pakistan will keep sitting on its part of Kashmir even though nobody that matters recognises it, and the world can say that Crimea is part of Ukraine every 5 minutes without it affecting anything at all. I've seen tonnes of maps with Western Sahara on them (probably to make a statement), though it certainly didn't make Moroccans withdraw, but I've yet to see a map where Jerusalem is fully integrated into Israel - and all these are just current cases that I could think of without looking anything up.

This becomes more clear when you look at the plans the companies make for the future. Tesla plans a SUV version priced above the Model 3. VW plans with a 27000 € car next year.

3965,"The answer is that you do not get rid of it. You put it in indefinite storage so that our descendants can recycle it in a couple of centuries if they so choose, or leave it if that has no interest. 

Spent nuclear fuel still contains almost all of its potential energy, it just also contains a lot of fission products which have a strong tendency to capture neutrons, which stops the chain reaction, which means the fuel cannot be burned up any further. 

Those isotopes can be separated from the plutonium and uranium, which is called reprocessing, but since the fission products are also very radioactive, it is very expensive and difficult to do so. Wait 400 years, and they decay into stable isotopes, at which point reusing the fuel becomes an exercise in relatively trivial chemistry.

Not really. That makes it easier to do good things but it is not in and of itself sufficient.

As for the British Empire the only time I would ever defend their legacy is in the context of WWII. They were indeed also murderous, genocidal, and starved people under their rule. I never claimed only communists could do those things. That would obviously be false. I only claim that communists have a nearly universally poor record when pertaining to the simple things like not committing wanton mass murder. Not sure why you keep bringing up Chile either.

The urea solution easily freezes in winter, crystallizes when the vehicle is not used for a long time and is generally difficult to ""wake up"" in certain brands when it goes into failsafe mode.

4020,"&gt; You should actually know one thing about the batteries. The price for 1kWh of Tesla is 100$, for VW it was 130$ when i last looked at this 6 month ago. That means the battery pack in Model 3 long range with 75kw is 7500$, and VW could offer it for below 10k. But even with this disadvantage for VW, it can easily beat the Model 3 somehow when it comes to their 2020 models while Tesla hasn't even sold a single Model 3 for 35k (which does not include VAT mind you)

Price is not everything, reliability and battery life is extremely important, too. But the much larger problem is that VW does not have the capacity to mass manufacture batteries, yet. It does not matter if you have a competitive product if you can't make enough of it. And the ID is probably going to be be competing with the Nissan Leaf rather than the M3, which is a similar range and only slightly higher price point while being a much more mature product.

4039,"&gt; Support for FN pretty much makes it seem to me there is a race issue in France and it can’t be really dismissed as something small and fringe.

There is issues with racists behaviours definitely, such as discrimination based on skin color by the French police for example. Support for the FN is definitely a sign that racism still exist in France, but I however doubt that it's the most accurate indicator for that. Even less now that the Party is lead by Marine Le Pen and not by Jean-Marie Lepen anymore, who was without any doubt a shameless racist and antisemite. 

Not to say that MLP is not racist, but she clearly comes across as significantly less racist than her father. Not knowing her personally, it could also be that she is better in marketing herself than her father was of course.

A second factor that make me say that, one you would be unlikely to know without living in France for several years at least, is that historically the voting for the FN was used not only for racists reasons but also as a protest vote again more mainstream political party. 

&gt; I like this as an example - https://youtu.be/9uMm415xDKY, there could be different interpretations of how it doesn’t show what I’m saying but I honestly disagree.

Ignorance in general, and wilful ignorance in particular, is a root cause of racism clearly. And of intolerance. I do think that education tend to be a good remedy to fight against that though, and that France -as a whole this time- could improve when it comes to that. But it's also important to make a distinction between wilful ignorance from people having racists ideas because they have no desire to learn about anybody or anything different, and ignorance that may come across as racist from people who have good intentions and are genuinely curious when meeting people from other ethnic or cultural background, but are way too clumsy in their way to try to know more. Lumping the two things together seems counter productive to fight racism, as it risks to antagonize people whose racism was more ""accidental"" than meant to hurt but got victim of their own lack of knowledge. 

To give you an example, I am French but currently don't live in France. Not so long ago, one of my relative asked me questions about where I live now that seemed dumb to me, but I took the time to answer them because the curiosity about a country where one of his family member is living was genuine. He didn't mean any harm. He simply didn't know. Ignorance shouldn't be shamed when there is a desire to learn, but only when there isn't.  To communicate properly, the two sides need to show good will. And patience. ",Europe,/r/europe/comments/b9ru7f/macron_appoints_researchers_to_evaluate_role_of/ek784ev/,NevDecRos,1554494033

4077,"&gt;So, you say Germany is in NATO to help NATO?
One thing I said Germany strategic location is a very important.
&gt;Is that also why the German military is, frankly, a completely useless pile of non-functional crap?
A that's the reason we a second biggest contributer to Afghanistan and in sizable amount in many EU and NATO missions. 
Also it is the second stronger non-functional crap on the European Mainland which is part of NATO.

&gt;If you are saying that Germany will not aid a military ally because you don't like their leader, fine.
Germany didn't want Afghanistan it always was extremly against it, even Yugoslavien wars were very unpopular and still we were in both and are the second highest contributer to Afghanistan.
Opinion rarely matter to this regard in Germany.
&gt;Get out of NATO, though
That would create serious Problems and would make Russia happy. In my personal opinion I would tend to leave NATO. In the Obama Area it was already clear that NATO has to big of challenge, even though Ukraine crisis revived it a bit, the US concentration on the Asia/Pacific will be a bigger challenge than the 2% GDP military spending(which personally I think is stupid)
&gt;Because you are not willing to accept the responsibilities of collective defense.
We always did even though a majority of the population doesn't like, but foreign is a small topic in German politics and mostly except in the Extremist not really something controversial on politics. Are Parties that governed Germany supported most military request from Allies. Iraq and Libya were the exception, but they were stupid to begin with.

&gt;And one of those is coming to the aid of an ally who was attacked. And yes, that means Afghanistan.
Afghanistan was legally very grey and Germany did follow and we are now second largest contributer, while the largest and reason why we are in Afghanistan is thinking about pulling out and never told anybody what the concrete long term plans were.

&gt;I think any ""big problem"" NATO might have with Germany pulling out would be easily handled

No, Kosovo and Afghanistan would a huge shortage on manpower, America could handle it, but that wouldn't be much fun. 
You would have a big Neutral in the middle of Europe and NATO and the question about NATO troops in Germany would be a questions in worse case scenario US would need to relocate huge troops and bases and would big problems. Also in responding to help eastern Partners. 
There other minor things.

&gt;You don't want to pay the costs of being in NATO.
What is the cost?

UK’s parliament could have come to an understanding of what it wanted, the redlines at least, then invoke A50 and then negotiate. But of course this would only work if the redlines are reasonable, but they aren’t. UK don’t want backstop, don’t want the border between Ireland and NI, don’t want the border between NI and the rest of the U.K., and not want to be part of a custom or trading union. Therefore all the options are denied by the UK’s parliament. These options aren’t imposed in any way by the EU, nor is the case that these options were the result of the negotiation between UK and the EU, these are the only options because you have to put the border somewhere, it’s reality itself that is telling UK that they should decide in one of those three, and the EU has been more than acomodating and flexible in allowing the UK to decide which it wants, so the U.K. not only could, it should have decided this before invoking A50 and even more, it should have been discussed before the referendum so people would know what they were voting for.

It’s just so absurd and shocking seeing that it’s not clear even at this point (at least not for everybody) that this is situation is the result of U.K.’s politics using the EU as some short of plaything and excuse to use in their own internal politics, the U.K.’s parlament fault that is causing all it’s political problems, and the terrible management of the whole process from the very beginning.

If you had a terminal illness and were in bed every day with an endless pain, wouldn't you want to just end it all instead of delaying the inevitable? What about the families? Do you know the suffering a loved one goes through when they see another loved one in bed suffering and not being able to do anything about it?

Would you still be against the ignorant pro-freedom mobs if one of your loved ones was in hospital, in their bed, in endless pain, connected to machines to stay alive, and you wanted to hear their voice again but remember they don't even have the strength for that anymore?

4109,"1. European Party Groups do have clear manifestos.

2. The European Commission being voted in by the Council/European Parliament is no different than the British Government being voted in by the British Parliament, except the British Parliament cannot vote on Ministers, while the Council/European Parliament can vote on Commissioners, making it more democratically accountable.

3. The European Commission does not ""dictate,"" nor does it ""dictate the agenda.""  It is true that the Commission has the right to initiate legislation, but there are a few caveats.  Firstly, the European Commission President is the lead candidate of the party group that won the plurality in the previous parliamentary election, meaning legislation initiated by the Commission generally is in line with the manifesto of said winning party group.  This is essentially the same as a Prime Minister coming from the party that won the parliamentary election in national elections. 
 Secondly, the Commission can only initiate legislation within the policy areas designated to the 'European,' or continental level by the national governments.  All other policy areas are in the hands of smaller jurisdictions.  Search the term 'subsidiarity.'  Thirdly, the Commission has no power to pass laws.  Only the Council/European Parliament have the power to pass laws, and they can amend legislation or kill legislation at their sole discretion.  This means no legislation becomes law without after being amended and passed by national governments and the firstly elected parliament.  Lastly, the Council/European Parliament have the right to vote in favor of the creation of legislation.  If a vote of this kind is passed, the Commission is obliged to introduce a piece of legislation regarding that topic, to then be amended and passed/refected solely by the Council/European Parliament.

If you actually learn and understand the process, you start to see how democratic is truly is, or at least how similar it is to national democracy.

Example:In January 2010, party donations by Substantia AG to the German FDP and CSU were made public by the German Press Agency. Substantia AG belongs to the Finck family (August von Finck junior) and had transferred 1.1 million euros to the FDP between October 2008 and October 2009 and 820,000 euros to the CSU in the run-up to the Bavarian state elections in 2008. 14 hotels were formerly operated in Germany by the Finck family (6 hotels were closed for 3 years) in the Mövenpick Group (as of September 2017), and the opposition parties in the German Bundestag criticised the donations. They see a connection between the donations to the FDP and the CSU and the tax relief for the hotel companies in Germany provided by these parties through the so-called Growth Acceleration Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010. As a result, the FDP was sometimes mockingly referred to as the ""Mövenpick Party"", and the FDP itself opposed the name on the grounds that in the past many tourism politicians from all parties represented in the Bundestag had also called for a reduction in taxes.

4176,"The first point is bollocks. Kosovo aside, Serbia’s relationships with its neighbours is fine and nothing worse than Hungary and Romania’s relationship. Despite having a border dispute with Croatia there has been absolute no conflict. Serbia let Montenegro go immediately in 2006 despite the vote being a sham, and relations with Bosnia are fine despite 40% of Bosnia’s population being Serbs who want to join Serbia. The territorial exchange with Kosovo was seen as a solution to the issue - Serbia isn’t prepared to abandon its citizens in a very hostile Kosovo and nor should it be. As for the wars last time I checked Serbia has co-operated fully with the international community in catching those responsible - personally arresting both Karadzic and Mladic

4182,"Vocational training is awesome and provides a direct practical step-up to the job market. 

However, your career can become severely limited by lower-level education. It always has the potential to become a hard boundary in certain fields for promotion, let alone finding the fitting entry-jobs. 

Universities (should) provide a more diffuse set of skills to critically engage within a non-practical ever-changing complex environment. There are a lot of studies in which the only true pratical preperation is for a career within an academical field. It is a common misconception that this is a bad thing by itself.  

What happens is that people leverage the learned skills into jobs within a new complex environment, for which practical training wouldn't be befitting anyways. It is obviously necessary, but is provided on-the-job. Multiple benefits of having done university come together: it is a proof of learning capacity, intelligence, capacity to deal with uncertainty, a social 'token' people feel is important. 

In no way am I arguing that you aren't capable, please don't think that. Apart from that, tiered educational systems are extremely important to prevent erosion of the most important part of society: the middle. The part where people are experts at what they do and actually do it.

That's actually a pretty decent attempt of debunking some of the myths cultivated by the military-industrial complex. 

This isn't new either, by the way. People with completely different political backgrounds (Bernie on the one hand, Rand Paul on the other) have repeatedly said so, and I do think they have a point. 

Be that as it may, the argument that you need a *capable* military force in order to conduct a credible foreign policy still stands, unless you want somebody else to take care of it. I disagree with the notion that throwing more money around indiscriminately without paying any attention to the real *needs* of the military structure will do the job. 

However, I do agree with the notion that Europeans in general and Germans in particular have some serious homework to do: The first one is making up their minds as to whether Europe should in fact be able to conduct foreign policy at least within its own sphere of interest independent of outside powers.

4252,"The rebate was a negotiated and justified response to an EU budget that asymmetrically benefited France. Before the rebate was won, the UK taxpaper was obligated to fund the French Agricultural sector primarily because our own was significantly smaller. Not only this, we were contributing more anyway because we do more trade with the rest of the world. The EU was (and still does) subsidizing only specific industries, and that resulted in blatantly unequal benefits and costs between the member states.

The opt out of the Euro has been thoroughly vindicated, I actually find it somewhat stupefying how many people on this sub refuse to acknowledge this (although I can guess that it's because they invariably live in those countries whose economies haven't been hamstrung and emasculated by the monetary union). And it's not just the UK, Denmark wants no part in the euro, and I don't expect that any other of the non-eurozone members are in any sort of hurry to join. 

Schengen-area membership makes little to no sense for those Member States who are not in Continental Europe (I shouldn't need to go into why, it's patently obvious).

Which opt-outs were wrangled through the use of the UK's veto? As an instrument, the UK has hardly ever exercised their veto at the Council level, and it should be noted that the we are hardly the only country opposed to further political integration and projects of economic folly. If you think that Britain's departure from the EU is going to somehow remove all obstacles to deeper integration and magically deliver a federalised European Union then you are in for an extremely rude awakening. 

Ultimately, with an extension through the EP elections, the UK is likely to agree to terms which would limit her voting power at the EU bodies, or otherwise refrain from exercising these privileges (it's in their interest to have this mess resolved soon as well, and provoking the EU is counterproductive). 

At any rate, the upcoming elections threaten to return the most fractured European Parliament in its history, it's foreseeable that it will take many months to elect the next commission even without participation from the UK.

4269,"&gt; It still adequately shows that knowing Dutch keeps dropping on the priority list. Having it as third language also means that it will get significantly less hours than the primary second language. Finally, some don't get to pick a third language, or don't pick Dutch at all even when they can.

English is used everywhere, Dutch can't compete with such a global language. If you had to choose between French and English, you would choose English too. Is this even surprising to you?

&gt; Total fluency is not the goal, the potential must be there, and it does allows you access to media of the other side, for example

In the article : Nog niet de helft van de leerlingen uit het zesde leerjaar haalt de eindtermen voor Frans lezen. Dat blijkt uit een onderzoek van de KU Leuven, dat VRT NWS kon inkijken. [...] Op de luisterproef haalden 7 op de 10 kinderen de eindtermen, bij de leesproef slaagde nog niet de helft: 45 procent. Minder dan een derde kan een situatie beschrijven aan de hand van een opsomming en kan correcte vragen stellen.

It seems that you need more than what they teach you in school to be able to consume media in the language. No surprise here, actually most of us speak English because of video games, books, series etc but certainly not because of school. What is true for English is also true for Dutch and French. You want people to speak better Dutch/French? Give them occasions and reasons to. Unfortunately, unless you actively seek to improve your French and Dutch, you never get the chance to practice because this country is monolingual. 

&gt; Personal anecdotes don't really matter, it's the big picture and the general trend.  

Yet, it's the case for most Walloons. Most have never step a foot in Flanders other than for the coast. Pretty much like most Flemings never come to Wallonia other than for the Ardennes. If Dutch was that useful, people would learn it. The reality is that English is far more useful, that's why they pick English. What's wrong with that? They could improve their Dutch too ofc, like Flemings could improve their French too. Is it worth it? Probably not for most people and that is normal. 

&gt;Even this afternoon I was in a Flemish bicycle shop in Flanders, and a French speaker was in front of me in the queue. In the 10 minute conversation that followed the French speaker didn't even try to speak a single word of Dutch. The conversation happened completely in French. And that's why there have to be language laws, to prevent the Dutch speakers from being marginalized due to their own willingness to do the effort to speak the other language.

This is a client-shop relationship, not comparable to daily life. When I worked at the café, we had many Dutch-speaking clients (both Dutch and Flemish) and none of them started the conversation in French or said a word in French. They said merci, yeah ok but it's also used in informal language so that doesn't really count. If you don't want to loose clients, you have to offer services in different languages. I'm not sure I would experience the same ""willingness"" in the middle of Antwerpse Kempen. 

&gt; Let me ask, if you were willing to give up an entire language for Belgium, why aren't you willing to learn an extra one for it? 

""Willing"" is not the appropriate word for a language that was literally banned in schools.  Children who spoke Walloon had to wear a dunce cap and had to clean the toilets as well. There was a real campaign against the Walloon language. Of course a lot of promises were made, the promise of a higher position in society if you spoke French which pushed people to learn French. Walloon was quickly labelled as uneducated and people stopped speaking it. 

&gt; I would rather have the balance restored by Wallonians getting better at Dutch rather than the Flemish getting worse at French.

There are plenty ways the Walloon government is encouraging people to learn languages, especially Dutch. For instance, Wallangues.be is an excellent initiative. A platform where Walloons can learn languages (NL/DE/EN) for free. That is the way to go, making Dutch mandatory is not possible for us and I don't think it would work. Imo, we should focus on English. It's by far easier than French or Dutch and it's more neutral than those two. 

Brussels is Brussels, don't lump us with them because we have very different opinions on this. Just in general, stop saying that all French speakers are the same. You wouldn't do that for English speaking countries so don't with francophones either. It's not because we all speak French that we all have the same culture. 

Also, there's a reason why DéFi exists in Brussels but doesn't get any support in Wallonia. It's high time for Flanders to move on and stop brining this story to the table every time languages are discussed. Let's move forward and stop looking at the past. Time when Dutch was regarded as a 2nd class language by the State is long gone. I too can bring less bright moments of Flemish history but I do not because it's behind us.

There is not suddenly going to be an Iron Curtain between us and trade will vanish. Things will settle down, deals will be signed and trade will continue with barely noticeable increased cost or difficulty.

Brexit is going to be looked upon in hindsight as a storm in a tea cup. A slightly embarrassing domestic political situation in the UK quickly remedied, and people will see the benefits it actually brought. Namely the ability for the EU to actual get on with ever closer union and avoiding a horrible future clash between that philosophy/ideal and the British desire to avoid it.

Fascism doesn't belong in a democratic society.

Ah yes, it's not as if there are big issues within the party because they are undemocratic. They aren't democratic at all.

&gt;
&gt;More time **could** lead to second referendum. 

The only reason to keep delaying Brexit is to bet on a change of public opinion. EU knows this, which is why they propose a 1 year extension. The UK government will accept the proposal and we'll see a second referendum in Q3 probably. 

&gt;And if it does I think an extension is fine

The end justifies the means, right? Who cares what people voted for less than 3 years ago? Who cares we haven't had a single day of Brexit yet? 

&gt;But I think the government should commit to that before they ask for an extension. 

It's still risky for them I think. But it's obvious they have no intention to deliver Brexit in any way shape or form.

“**What Happened At Kurapaty?**

Historians say that between 1937 and 1941, a period of mass killings and political persecution, the NKVD carried out large-scale executions in the wooded lands of Kurapaty.

The tragedy remained shrouded in Soviet secrecy until 1988, when a Belarus historian and one of the founders of the opposition Belarusian Popular Front party exposed what had happened.

Appearing during the Glasnost era under Mikhail Gorbachev, an article by Zianon Pazniak in the Litaratura i mastactva newspaper sparked some of the first protests in the Soviet Union and gave a boost to the pro-democracy and pro-independence movement in Belarus in the waning days of the U.S.S.R.

An investigation conducted from 1988 to 1995 established that Kurapaty contained the remains of 220,000 to 250,000 people, who were identified as victims of Stalin`s political terror.”

&gt;Lol, the UK has not blamed the UK not using the transitional provisions on the EU, it's been solidly blamed on Tony Blair and Labour. Don't know why you are trying to talk about politics you clearly know nothing about.

For sure, moron. If you'd ask a leave voter who was responsible for unfettered (EU)immigration, he would say ""Tony Blair"". Glad you're not deluded as fuck or anything.

&gt;&gt;Those ""principles"" you speak of were explicitly postulated in the accession treaties as optional for a period of time.

&gt;The principle we've been talking about is FoM, not accession treaties. If the principle of FoM is universally good, then a country would have no need to block it using said treaties.

No. You're the only one talking pretending that the transitional provisions didn't exist. The EU members put those into the treaties so clearly the FoM = sacred is bullshit you're making up to make your retarded ass feel better. 

You calling hypocrisy on them for sticking to the rules that they all, including the UK, laid out, is idiocy of the highest degree.

FoM is sacred apart from when it's not. smh, coherent argument from the fanatics as per usual.

This is what we call laws and treaties. Ask mommy to explain what that is, or maybe draw you a picture since you seem to have some trouble with them difficult wordsies. In actuality it's ""FoM"" is the law apart from the time period where we all agreed that it is not yet (for workers from the newer members)"". The fact that the UK government didn't even bother to ask for this ""exception"" you're talking about might have tipped a less idiotic person off to the fact that this would be like asking a policeman if you could ignore red lights for a couple of years, please. The EU agreed to a set of rules and it's job is to enforce these rules. The fact that during a transitional time period where the traffic lights were new/being built it was still ok to ignore this law does make it a negotiable law now.

&gt;&gt;""The situation"" is a disaster the UK government and media has been cooking up for themselves over decades.

&gt;I really do fear for the youth of today, unable to handle any view with even a hint of nuance.

The youth of today seems to have a pretty good grasp on Brexit. 3 out of 4 voted against massively fucking the UK economy. Then again they seem to have the advantage of not suffering from delusions of grandeur based on centuries past.

&gt;&gt;It has very little to do with FoM among EU members (very little brown people in the EU)

&gt;Lol. Must be nice living in lala land. 1. on the exit poll, Sovereignty. No. 2 Immigration.

Except that ""Sovereignty"" and ""Immigration"" are vague terms and the sentiment behind them that mostly relates to immigrants from outside the EU.

&gt;&gt;responsibility for that'd still be squarely in the UKs governments corner for not limiting FoM of the new members as per the treaties.

&gt;So embracing FoM = Bad when the UK does it. Good when everyone else does it! Idiot.

Did you ask mommy what those law and treaty thingies are yet? Get back to me when you have.

The 4th largest economy in the world, that doesn't apply for a 66% rebate while having pretty much the same percentage of farmland as the UK doesn't seem to have a problem with FoM within the EU. Then again their government and media haven't been lying to them for close to half a century about evil, corrupt controlling EU.

&gt;I'm not here to teach morons who can't do their own research, heres a copy and paste from wikipeidia.

Except the 4th largest economy is Germany, not France and you posting the UKs rational for the rebate doesn't address my point that Germany is in the exact same position as the UK when it comes to CAP but doesn't ask for a rebate. Tell me about that reading comprehension again.

&gt;&gt;Who told you that? Clearly you're not speaking from experience. Countries like Spain, Portugal and Ireland have/had vastly disproportionate wealth too.

&gt;Spain, Portugal and Ireland are poor as shit.

Happy to see you know *something*. So why has FoM with those countries not been such a ""blindingly obvious bad idea"" then, hm?

&gt;&gt;The EU has always been a system of net contributors and net benefactors. Unless peace and cooperation count as selfishness your ""every country is only in it for themselves"" theory only exposes your own sorry mindset.

&gt;Except all the net contributors gain something in the exchange, how naive are you.

And that includes the UK.

&gt;&gt;Hilarious. I'm sure Ukip would have dissolved

&gt;UKIP won the referendum and still dissolved lmao.

And that somehow proves that they would have dissolved if the EU had allowed a temporary suspension of FoM. Impeccable logic.

After losing a referendum the establishment would be able to ignore them with impunity.

Yes, clearly that would have solved the problem. Just like the Scottish independence crowd disappeared after losing their referendum. Is that why the Uk didn't even bother to ask for such an exemption from FoM? Or could it be that even a political genius like David ""I don't regret calling for the referendum I only regret the outcome"" Cameron saw that this was a retarded idea that would solve nothing? [Here's what happened in what we call ""Reality""](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35622105).

&gt;&gt;the British media stopped the bendy banana narratives and the British public would have discarded their island identity while the sullen Lost Empire English exceptionalism would have magically turned into pro EU sentiment!

&gt;Lol. Almost the entirety of the British Political Establishment is Pro-EU, it's blinding obvious that the UK wouldn't have another referendum on the issue for a long time.

Conveniently ignoring the public opinion and the media, but tell me again about all those establishment politicians- is that why they haven't been able to agree on what color the sky is when it comes to Brexit? Because they're all so Pro EU? Tell me again about me not knowing anything about politics, I love to laugh.

&gt;&gt;B) Showing themselves as reasonable and reform-able.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What a weird way to spell susceptible to blackmail.

&gt;AhahahaAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHA

&gt;Inside the mind of the EU fanatic, when a memberstates leader coming to negotiate in time of crisis is called blackmail.

&gt;Idiot.

A ""crisis"" said leader promised his voters he would cause. A ""crisis"" based on sentiment caused by decades of lies, delusions and ignorance. A self made ""crisis"" demanding concessions that would only serve as precedent for breaking all rules and treaties if you stir up enough shit and hold a gun to your head.

&gt;&gt;lying about them not existing and blaming the EU is a fuck up.

&gt;Your reading comprehension is terrible.

Your delusions are hilarious. Do yourself a favor and go out on the street and ask a leave voter who is responsible for EU immigration- Tony Blair or the EU. Should help you to avoid future embarrassment when you're spouting your idiocy on the internet.

&gt;&gt;I support the EU sticking to the rules that they themselves (including the UK) laid out. If they wouldn't you could cancel the whole thing. One can call that inflexible and that's a reasonable position, but pointing to an exception within the rules and derive from that an entitlement for exceptions outside the rules and calling the denial of said exception hypocrisy is just so very, very revealing.

&gt;Even if the 'rules' mattered when the EU28 agree on something, which they don't, there is provision in the EU law framework for these types of concession anyway.

&gt;The transitional provisions show that FoM is not a sacred principle, all nations of the EU15 apart from the UK, Sweden and Ireland admitted through their actions that under some scenarios FoM should be suspended.

And they explicitly clarified what that scenario would be: the transitional period after the accessions.

&gt;Only when someone else wishes to question the sacred cow that is FoM do they put it upon a pedestal. It is the epitome of hypocrisy.

Of course my dear, it doesn't have anything to do with the laws and treaties that everyone agreed on, it's because those meanies hate your fish and chip filled guts! After you saved them from the Nazies, no less! Those hypocrites sticking to the rules that everyone, including the UK, agreed on just because it's you asking for an exception.

4663,"Why is this sub filled with xenophobic bullshit?

First, what counts as an act of terror for this map? The term is quite an umbrella, it doesn’t need to be perpetuated by immigrants to be considered terrorism.

Second. Many countries with a lot less strict immigration policies have also had no zero attacks. This is because terrorists organisations hit the places that they find strategically relevant, the places they know will make the news and affect a wider population. It’s true that Poland is a very important country in Europe but Eastern Europe is not as considered in the mainstream as Western Europe is and that’s a reality. 

Also, take into account population. Countries with a higher population are more prone to crime or acts that might count as terrorism because, again, they would affect a wider population. Poland is populated, but not as much as other countries. In the case of smaller nation, it is due to population density, bigger groups of people packed into smaller areas.

As of the 19th of July 2018, 151 Rafales had been delivered to France (see page 4 of that link), with no more planned for delivery until 2022 (when another 28 will eventually be delivered). Another 30 may potentially be ordered afterwards for delivery before 2030.

Then for exports, Egypt has ordered 24 but had only received 14 as of mid-2018, Qatar had ordered 24 as well, but [the first was only delivered in February 2019](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/picture-qatar-receives-first-of-36-rafale-fighters-455567/), and finally India has ordered 36 but [the first isn't due to be delivered until September this year.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-dassault/india-says-french-made-rafale-jets-to-be-inducted-in-september-2019-idUSKCN1QL0KX)

So in total, roughly 170 Rafales would have been delivered as of today.

By comparison, more than 390 F-35s have been delivered as of a couple of days ago, according to the Pentagon's F-35 program manager (skip to 2 minutes in if it doesn't automatically): https://youtu.be/LZBMWzCA_Gg?t=120",Australia,/r/europe/comments/b9iaxs/pentagon_eyes_f35_sales_to_greece_romania_and/ek5vkwh/,Dragon029,1554451086

British actions saved thousands. It wasn't enough, but far from actively preventing efforts, Churchill was frustrated and upset that he couldn't do more for them.

Not longer revelant but interesting: The UK didn't have an independent supreme court until 2009. Before then a comitee in the  House of Lords served as the final court of appeal.  
Regional but interesting: In Scotland, all heraldry and symbols which look heraldric are tightly controlled by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, something sports clubs, companies and government institutions have fallen afowl of. In England this role is played by several different people: The hereditary Lord Marshall, the King of Arms, the Garther Principal, the Clarenceux, and the Norroy and Ulster.  


Political mish-mash: The commission to appoint the modern lords usually tries to give some representation of all parties in the Common, but two parties have refused to have any Lords out of ideological opposition to the institution: Sinn Fein and the SNP.  


Bureaucratic but interesting: the UK does not have an effective Land Registry the way other countries have it. The instituion is relatively new, compulsory registration even newer, and only when a property is sold. Most of England still is based on held deed and as a consequence properties with no known owner or boundries. Scotland, by comparison. actually has a land registry that is 4 centuries old, and now has mandatory registration for all properties in existance. Most of the land in both is still in unknown hands.  


Ecological, and probably not interesting: The IUCN created the category V and VI for Protected Enviroments specifically because England's National parts did not actually qualify as actual National Parks, but they wanted to be under the umbrella. As a result those categories are populated almost exclusively by all the English Protected Areas.

I mentioned this [in a longer comment at the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/akbeqa/polish_farright_trial_raises_spectre_of_false/ef3k06o/?context=3) but to put a tl;dr:

A terror attack in Ukraine carried out by three Poles (with the intent of making it look as if committed by Ukrainian nationalists) had one guy give testimony that they were payed by a certain German ""journalist"" called Ochsenreiter. That guy in return worked for Frohnmaier and just recently quit his job there to ""not damage his reputation"". Both of them clearly belong to/support the rightmost wing of the AfD, similar to Höcke for example.

The major question remaining is if all of this is just an odd coincidence, whether they reserved compensation for it or whether he didn't mind doing it for free.

No, it isn't. It's goodweather declaration signed by the chancellor and the foreign minister to signal support for the alliance in the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine by stating that they aim to increase defence expenditures within a decade toward a certain threshold. 

They shouldn't have signed it. Firstly, because as we see, it's been haunting them ever since (which was pointed by the German opposition at the time). Secondly, because neither the chancellor nor the foreign minister in Germany have a mandate to commit funding to anything, because the power of the purse is vested in parliament, not the executive.

4943,"&gt; As it is just Trump then it is a bit of an overreaction to consider the US as an unreliable ally, even if the trust has taken a hit.

I don't think so; rather, it's just realpolitik. The geopolitical situation has to be assessed anew again and again depending on the changing circumstances, and if the POTUS openly questions the US' commitment to NATO, then that does render the US an unreliable ally. This isn't just me, either, else we would not have had the boost for PESCO. In a way, Trump thus actually did Europe a favor by highlighting the problem.

And yes, these circumstances may change again after the next elections, and I would hope, even expect they do. But we will have to wait and see just how much of the ""America First"" ideology will stick around. For now, it makes perfect sense to take current developments at face value and make sure the EU can stand on its own two feet rather than having to rely on third parties, especially when said parties have begun to interfere in Member States' democratic process, as is the case with Mr. Grenell, according to interviews he gave.

I'll freely admit that this is also a matter of pride, though. I'm a staunch European, and ""we can do better"".

&gt; Then how it is any different from NATO article 5?

Legally? It's not. I was under the impression you were advocating for NATO as some sort of superior option.

*Realistically*, however, you must also assess the current geopolitical situation (as mentioned above) and ask yourself what makes an ally who is (a) an entire ocean away, (b) has already begun to weaken European security by unilaterally cancelling the IMF treaty, and (c) is currently pursuing an isolationist course more likely to intervene *and* stick around in a European conflict than a fellow Member State which (a) shares a political union and (b) is likely going to ""be next"" and thus far more interested in committing troops even in the long run. The US aren't following Domino Theory anymore, after all.

Maybe US isolationism will be reversed in the near future, but that doesn't mean we should take this for granted. Whilst the attitude of the US administration may change with the next president, it does not remove the conditions that enabled the current to treat EU states as if they were US vassals. It's up to the Europeans to change this and let the EU assert itself militarily as the reasonably powerful bloc it already is in terms of diplomacy and economy.

There's no need to let missions like Operation Concordia be delayed by months just because a non-EU NATO partner - in that case Turkey - is being difficult. The EU has the potential to develop its own independent capabilities and pursue its own agenda as per its own ideals rather than playing second fiddle to US adventures in the Middle East.

&gt; Federal territory is a bit of a stretch isn't it?

Eh, it's German law, Germany is a federation. Of course, I would assume the wording to be different if similar clauses were adopted for a standing European army -- if this is not already the case re. collective self-defence in the Union Treaty.

&gt; No but in a EU military that has replaced all national militaries a decision like this would unravel the whole military. [...] The EU military means that all national militaries are replaced with one shared, EU wide, military. You don't think there would be any conflict with who gets to play with it?

I do, but I'm not concerned because [the mechanisms of control are already in place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Security_and_Defence_Policy#Bodies_and_leadership): any ""playing"" is subject to approval by the Council of the European Union, which seems to be working nicely so far. Including the [military operations already undertaken by the EU in the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_and_civilian_missions_of_the_European_Union#List).

Subject to the laws of the individual Member State, [even national parliaments](https://ddd.uab.cat/pub/llibres/2005/hdl_2072_204361/3-Parliamentary_oversight_of_EU_external_military.pdf) may have control over the participation of its troops in a European mission abroad -- although this is a bit of a ""relic"" as such laws are obviously meant to safeguard parliamentary control over ""traditional national"" militaries. In the case of the establishment of a larger standing EU army, I would expect either (a) this parliamentary control to be transferred to the European Parliament or (b) troops from a Member State with ""too much"" national parliamentary control to simply not be considered for rapid reaction forces, so as to prevent unnecessary delays caused by national politics in what would be an international, pan-european response to a crisis. Ideally, we'd probably have both, but that's just my preference based on a quick assessment.

That aside ...

Technically, a unified European military does *not* have to replace all national militaries; that would be just one of several possible options, and one that nobody is seriously pursuing right now. The US has a federal military in addition to state militaries; a similar setup would be quite possible for the EU as well, with a fully integrated European military under EU command alongside Member States' national militaries.

In a way, we already have this in the form of the standing EU Battlegroups. The rest is ""just"" a question of numbers, i.e. just how big a proper EU standing army should be. Its primary purpose would likely be the execution of EU peacekeeping operations, in addition to serving as a rapid response force, and for this it doesn't have to be very large.

&gt; replace all national militaries with a EU military(btw that is the definition of a EU military) 

You should tell the EU, [apparently they didn't get the memo](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/33077/st06838-en18.pdf). \*scnr* ;)

&gt; Finnish(and Greek, Austrian etc.) men would essentially be second class citizens, being the only ones who must serve in the military.

If you come with this argument, you must also recognize that they already *are* second-class citizens in their own national military on account of women somehow still being exempted from conscription.

And ultimately, this is only an argument in favor of maintaining national militaries as a pool of conscripts, which would essentially serve as reserves in case of collective defence being triggered, whereas EU military forces would be made up exclusively of volunteers, just like how the Bundeswehr only ever sent career soldiers abroad (which I presume is the same for Finland, etc).",Europe,/r/europe/comments/b9aisc/wich_countries_are_the_public_in_key_nato/ek5ct5d/,akashisenpai,1554430137

4949,"&gt;What war? There is no war in Iraq, there is no war in Afghanistan, there is no war in all the African nations they come from, there is no war in Iran, nor is there one in Pakistan or the Balkans and even the one in Syria is more or less done. 

This is a list of ongoing armed conflicts -&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts

The War in Afghanistan is not over yet. According to the above link, (sourced by Acled Data) there have been 8,885 fatalities in 2019 alone.

The Syrian Civil War is not over yet. ISIS no longer has any territory left but that doesn't mean that groups affiliated with them have ceased to exist. Turkey has also invaded from the Northwest (in a bid to support the FSA and oppose the Kurds) and the differences between Assad's government and the members of the Free Syrian Army haven't gone anywhere. More than 2,000 people have died in the Syrian Civil War in 2019.

There is also a big crisis in Yemen and an ongoing civil war between the Houthis and the Hadis. 937 deaths in 2019, more than 25k last year.

Now, let's look at the situation in Africa. The Civil War in Somalia (which has also spilled over to Kenya since Al-Shabab had a foothold at its border) has claimed 187 lives in 2019. Nigeria is plagued by communal and ethno-religious conflicts which have claimed 142 lives so far this year and they are also facing Boko Haram's insurgency in the Northeast. An insurgency that has claimed 236 lives so far this year and has also spilled over to neighboring Cameroon, Niger and Chad. The South Sudanese Civil War is still ongoing and ethnic violence persists which has resulted in 93 deaths so far in 2019. In Mali there is a conflict in the North between the government and Azawad separatists and the Al-Qaeda still has a presence in the region. 333 deaths so far in 2019. In Cameron there is a conflict with separatists in the Northwest and Southwest regions that has resulted in 234 deaths so far in 2019. Conflicts are also raging on in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Egypt, Libya, Sudan, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Angola and Burundi. Oh, and we shouldn't forget about the general insurgency in the Maghred either (which has actually contributed to the aforementioned Northern Mali conflict and the Boko Haram insurgency). 260 deaths in 2019.

The conflict in Iraq isn't over either yet. Militias affiliated with ISIS are still active there and there was a new insurgency in 2017. There were 4,861 fatalities last year in Iraq. 85 deaths in 2019 so far.

As for Pakistan, there are actually 3 different conflicts. The conflict with India in the Kashmir region (105 fatalities in 2019), the insurgency in Balochistan along the Iranian border (36 fatalities in 2019) and the war against Taliban-affiliated groups in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (29 fatalities in 2019).

In Iran, there is unrest in two separate areas. In the Northwest where there has been low-level fighting with the Kurds and in the Southeast (Sistan and Baluchestan) which is affected by the aforementioned Balochi insurgency I mentioned above. It doesn't look like there have been a high number of fatalities so far this year.

The single worst I've had is a few times people made jokes about kebab and ask if i'm from alanya and stuff. That's literally it.

Or to say that if it had happened they would have deserved it. Nevermind just plain old denial. Every single country east of Germany also has these very deep hardline nationalistic traits.

You are obviously free to dismiss the author. That said, the fact that you are also dismissing Chomsky so casually tells me all I need to know about where you stand. Chomsky isn't ""stepping out of his specialty to talk about politics"". Chomsky isn't just a linguist. He is also a leading figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He has also impacted the field of psychology with his critique towards behaviorist psychology and he is the recipient of an American Psychology Association Award for his contribution. He is the recipient of numerous awards around the globe (including a Guggenheim Fellowship) and he is recognized by academia worldwide.

You see, this notion that a scientist only has one specialty and can't do anything else is relatively recent.

Then when they do get in, many give dishonest interviews to the one processing the application or give sob stories such as that they are so traumatized by e.g. Syria they can't even speak of the country. So what happens then is that it becomes a court case, often with non profit organizations supplying lawyers specialized in telling what the refugee should do and not do to get the best chances of asylum and residence. It's such a pain, and it doesn't even stop when they get a negative result and are told they should leave they actually need to leave as well and not just go to another European country to repeat the process. The combined cost for food, shelter, medicine, administrative staff, the legal process is high, around as high per year as the average income.",,/r/europe/comments/b9ga73/migrants_planning_border_push_clash_with_police/ek5399m/,Neo_Metalsonic,1554422447

5045,"I wil lanswer that point very politely despite your arrogance but you should inform yourself because France didn't want NATO involvement (mostly because NATO means US leadership and it can piss off many arabic countries who have diplomatic ties with France. NATO coordinates the operations but the french army stayed under french command. I see nowhere that France ""borrow"" ammunitions from NATO, have you got sources on that? I couldn't find any it just said that NATO was low on ammunitions but not France in itself.  

About the context : The french president Sarkozy liked NATO and in favor of the USA. He negotiated the return of France to the integrated military command. This was the most pro-NATO our government was since a long time. His campaign was also funded by Muammar Gaddafi so he used the opportunity of the civil war to cut his ties with an embarassing ""friend"" (who can blackmail him). On the other hand, Gaddafi was slaughtering his population and Benghazi almost fell on his hands so you can argue that the intervention was a good thing. 

Also, NATO isn't supposed to be used for the Libya war. It's supposed to be a defensive alliance where countries help eachother in case of an aggression. It's not supposed to lead a coalition but it's better when you declare a war to do so under the banner of a coalition (USA knows that too well).

5106,"&gt;A survey of attitudes to science commissioned by manufacturing giant 3M suggests around half of people in the UK regret not embarking on a scientific career.

&gt;3M’s 2019 State of Science Index (SOSI) used interviews and online questionnaires to survey attitudes to science in a sample of more than 14,000 people across 14 countries. In the UK, 48% of roughly 1000 respondents said they would pursue a career in science if they could go back and start again. Several reasons for not working in science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) were given – 27% said they didn’t consider themselves clever enough, while 25% said they did not do well in science at school, and 24% hadn’t been interested in these subjects at the time.

&gt;3M says these trends could damage the UK’s strong international reputation as a leader in science and technology, and that there is the potential for damaging stereotypes being passed on to future generations. Of UK parents surveyed, 35% admitted making potentially discouraging statements to their children such as ‘I am not a science/maths person’ or ‘science/maths won’t be important for your career in the long run’. At the same time, 60% of respondents think other countries value science more than the UK.

&gt;‘The UK findings of this year’s SOSI clearly show that there is a disconnect between the way people perceive Stem careers relative to their own ability,’ said Jayshree Seth, corporate scientist and chief science advocate at 3M, in a statement. ‘There is work to be done by the science industry in breaking down these barriers and making science accessible, both in terms of creating an environment where Stem careers can be pursued, and people feel inspired to take an active interest in how science can meet the world’s most pressing challenges.’",Europhile != EUphile,/r/europe/comments/b9ivkp/half_of_britons_wish_theyd_pursued_a_career_in/ek4t6q0/,gsurfer04,1554414563

\&gt; The tradition of male circumcision amongst Jews stems from Judaism. If  you're not Jew in the religious sense, then what's the argument for  continuing the tradition?   


Because it's a tradition, the same reason non-religious Jews will still often have shabbat dinner or westerners celebrating Christmas without believing in Christ. Jews have deemed the tradition to be worth the downsides. Even if you're non-religious, if you still want to marry within the Jewish culture, you're going to have a hard af time doing so if your uncircumcised. And circumcision is a pretty un-fun experience. As a result, our culture has decided to circumcise babies to save some of the trouble for them as adults.   


I can think of a million things parents can do while raising their children that will cause more substantial problems than whether or not they circumcised their boys. If you don't want to circumcise your kid then you don't have to, however if you do, I highly doubt that your child is ever going to give you shit for it.

5238,"&gt; So in other words

I'm not sure why you would want to oversimplify such a complex matter and compress it into one sentence that paints everything black and white, disregarding a variety of issues and influences that are not economy-related.

Also, Romania never was part of the USSR - so I'm not sure why you would even bring this into the debate. Just because the political and economic system were similar in some aspects doesn't mean it was the exact same thing.

Apart from that, the ""free market capitalism"" didn't lie, because a theory or a concept can not lie. Its potential, its benefits and downsides are not characteristics set in stone either. It is up to the government how they implement these concepts ultimately. The worst political/economic theory can be turned into something useful and the best theories can be turned into something shitty.

I'm also not aware of the fact that someone promised to solve all issues with free market capitalism. And it was overall a pretty slow process of change after the revolution in 1989.

5331,"&gt; If it has so many advantages compared to uranium (no weapons grade nuclear material, short half-life, abundant fuel, meltdown proof) why has no commercial reactor been build since the research started in the 1960's?

-----------------------------


The pressurized water reactors we use today were originally designed for use in submarines. When time came for us to use nuclear reactors for civilian power generation, we were already heavily invested in this type of reactor. There was a strong incentive not to ""reinvent the wheel"".

There was funding for the ARE (Aircraft Reactor Experiment), which was the first molten salt reactor, which eventually led to the MSRE. The MSRE went critical on U233 and proved LFTRs viability. (U233 is bred from Thorium and is the actual fuel of a LFTR.)

Eventually the air force realized it was idiotic to put a reactor in an airplane, U233 bred from Thorium was difficult to weaponize due to inherent U232 contamination which has daughter fission products that are strong gamma emitters and destroy bomb electronics as well as delivering lethal doses of radiation meaning weapons would have to be assembled/handled remotely, not to mention that satellite gamma detectors can see such strong gamma emissions clearly making it impossible to hide such a weapon.

The Nixon administration pulled funding for the MSRE and fired Alvin Weinberg (who invented and held the patents for the reactors we use today) from his post as head of Oak ridge National Laboratory, when he refused to sit down and shut up about the safety and economic advantages of Thorium MSR. Alvin believed Thorium MSR was the correct path forward, not the liquid metal fast breeder.

The Nixon administration instead choose to pursue the liquid metal fast breeder a sodium cooled reactor. This reactor could breed PU239 from U238 for use in weapons.


-------------------------

**So Why Aren't We Using LFTR's Now?**


1. There is no incentive for the nuclear industry to invest in the development of a new type of reactor (that goes against their business model). They construct reactors at or near cost and make money on the sale of fuel rods, much like an inkjet printer business model. With a LFTR you don't have to fabricate the fuel, just toss in the Thorium and go. This goes against their business model. 

2. Lack of military application, LFTRs breed Uranium 233 from Thorium 232, but always produce some degree of Uranium 232 contamination. Because of this it is more difficult to weaponize than enriching Uranium 235, or breeding Plutonium 239. LFTRs are not appreciable breeders, meaning they produce only enough Uranium 233 to continue their operation and no more, diverting Uranium 233 for use in weapons will cause the reactor to shut down.

3. Greenpeace and hippies hate anything with the word nuclear in it, and they refuse to listen to facts about LFTR technology. It is like arguing with a brick wall.

4. People are ignorant and aren't demanding our government invest in LFTR technology. Many have this attitude that if it were that good we would be using it already so it must be a hoax or a scam like a water powered car. It's sad really the thought we could uplift the developing world out of poverty and boost our standard of living tremendously, all from a technology that was proven viable more than 50 years ago, and NO ONE CARES.

5. It would take a huge financial investment to go from a small prototype reactor that was built more than 50 years ago, to a 1000MW commercial reactor. It would take government funding with a military budget to make this happen.

The whole story took place on Tuesday at the Fryderyk Chopin Airport in Warsaw. Denis Lisov, a 39-year-old Russian citizen and his three daughters went through the check-in procedure. While checking the documents, it turned out that the girls are considered missing in Sweden.

The border guards immediately arrived and transported the father and daughters to the police station.

There it was established that Lisov and his wife and eldest daughter Sofia (who is 12 years old today) moved to Sweden seven years ago. During their stay in Sweden, the family expanded by two more daughters - Serafina (now 6 years old) and four-year-old Alisa.

During her stay in Sweden, Lisov's wife was diagnosed with an illness, probably schizophrenia, and the father himself was considered incapable of caring for his daughters. They were given to a Muslim foster family ( the girls are Christians).

""Swedish social workers came forward to collect the girls, but the police did not return them. Last night the girls spent in the police station, where we provided them with the most comfortable accommodation possible, thanks to the support of one of the hotels that had lent us.... beds"" - was written on the official profile of the Warsaw police on Twitter.

The case went to the court in Warsaw, which on Wednesday decided that the girls can stay with their father in Poland. Denis Lisov has already applied for refugee status.

I think most of that makes sense if you consider Trump to basically be the billionaire equivalent of a second hand car salesmen. Mind that he didn't get rich, he was funded by his rich daddy and suffered through a number of bankruptcies. 

Trump isn't a grand planner, but rather trying to sell his image, his name. He's gonna tell you whatever he thinks is the right thing to say in any given situation, and that has usually little respect for what he said in the past. 

I'd bet that the president-ship is for him likely more of an ego thing. Basically a point his personal list of lifegoals. To be frank, I wouldn't be surprised If he finds a nice excuse to step down before the next election. As much as people try to ascribe him political motivations, I don't think he's got much of a plan or fun being the president.

&gt;He's acted as a 'normal' republican, but there are moments where's he's been particularly erratic, including to his detriment. I don't think he's a fascist now. Authoritarian tendencies? Yes, but that's also because he's impatient and he wants something done *now*, without understanding rules. 

One thing is for certain, he has little respect for democratic processes. I imagine he just thinks himself above the 'common' people, and doesn't care much for the details of distributed power etc. Trump thinks he does the right thing, has popular support, and that's all what counts. 

But as said, I also very much doubt that he wants to change anything about the democratic processes. I don't think he has dared so much as talking about changing the constitution or anything?

5412,"&gt;Fascism: A form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.

I did take a very general definitoin, to be fair, but that makes it sounds a bit like a behaviour; Facism is more of a political ideology.

&gt;I had to add the above definition, because your definition of fascism was a bit too general. 'Strong regimentation of society and the economy' can work for Communist, Theocratic and Fascist regimes.

It's important *why* they do that, though. Communists want to redefine economy and human society. Facist generally just care about a super strong state and leader mentality justified by their mythological level of nationalism. Their approach to economy tends to be pragmatic, because (at least with the Nazis) they just didn't have much of an economic ideology.

&amp;#x200B;

The funny thing with Trump is that he basically just did the thing you'd expect from him: He limited government and regulation, lowered taxes and invited a boatload of lobbyists into the white house, even more than usual.

While he's a bit isolationist with trade (only a bit though, not enough to hurt his own business interests), most of his actual politics fit quite well what you'd expect from a lying, billionare neoliberal. Just with a bit of added populism and the fitting bit of nationalism+xenophobia.

If you would have asked the CDU governemnt of 1983 if they wanted to phase out nuclear they would have laughed in your face, just as they laughed at the Green party at the time. But times have changed, havent they?

Germany has a history of closing down nuclear plants because of protest, this discusion was never only about exclusively the 2010 decision, it was about that the protest had effect on Germany's policy regarding nuclear. And it has and had that is clear, and I never solely blamed the greens for closing down the nuclear power plants.

Hydro projects are very long term and not easy to push. Nature of hydro necessitates flooding certain areas, which have its own ecological issues, historical issues, or plain and simple people living there who will fight tooth and nails the eminent domain purchases. It's similar story with pumped storage.

&gt;we can use big balancing batteries like the one Australia bought from Elon Musk recently to reduce the overcapacity needed.

This 'big' battery isn't really that big. We'd need to build thousands of those to actually properly cover our needs.

&gt;Part of the solution is just to add more links between countries. There's no cloud big enough to cover the whole EU. And with 3-hour differences between peak hours the capacity needed to handle peaks decreases dramatically.

Issue is politics. EU isn't unified entity, and until it becomes such each nation state will look internally for its energy security. So while there's option of energy trading to reduce costs and CO2 emissions, something already happening by the way, we still need to remain self sufficient if needs be.

&gt;Renewables have the huge advantage that they scale. You can start small and work incrementally with progress done each month. With nuclear it's measured in years.

Again, you can start small but at some point you reach the point where the balancing issues simply stop the progress. What we do need is comprehensive ""post coal"" plan, including renewables, storage and nuclear... but we don't have such a plan. Nor we have willingness to put massive resources necessary to actually implement it... plus there are obvious issues with miners. So yeah, I don't expect anything to change.

Neither is nuclear. So we will need to have flexible capacity no matter what. So we might as well use it to enable renewables instead of nuclear.

&gt;But what will you do when there isn't enough? You can't force wind to blow harder, currents to be stronger or sun to shine brighter exactly when you need it to. 

Germany already gets 66% of its electricity from renewables on several days per month. The question is not what to do when there is a shortage, the question is how to most usefully use the excess? And the answer to that is chemical storage.

The world is trying to make every machine run on electricity, including cars and such. But for these to be ""clean"" the electricity has to itself be produced by clean methods.  
Nuclear energy is relatively clean, as Nuclear waste is always contained and doesn't escape into nature like all the other energy producing processes.

You can't exactly bellyache and passive-aggressively whine about something if you didn't do that precise thing either in the first place.

Anyway, the Mojave number came from [a calculation made in 2018 by Bill Nussey on freeingenergy.com](https://www.freeingenergy.com/how-much-solar-would-it-take-to-power-the-u-s/). Not the most academic source, but again, it was a quick proof-of-concept grab in order to demonstrate my point about the amount of construction and land area required to get enough solar panels. The source also mentions rooftop solar, but I didn't touch on it because I know it'll be a harder sell for both consumers and producers; it's more difficult to monetize than something like a solar or nuclear plant and it's bound to get some pushback from more conservative political entities. It's less certain it'll happen on the scale you want it to, is the crux of that argument.

You specifically asked about the storing mechanisms for nuclear waste. Now, it should already be clear to you that both fusion and Thorium fission reactors produce no nuclear waste, so I won't waste either of our time by going through the future plans for these. It's already a used method for nuclear waste storage to dig it deep into underground rock and leave it there in sealed capsules to rest. There's one such location under construction in Finland right now, [Onkalo](http://www.posiva.fi/en/final_disposal/onkalo#.XKX_trhRVhE), and there are a few in use around the globe although not currently enough for the entire world's radioactive waste. It is an extra source of construction that I do acknowledge and I think should be taken into account.

You also asked about the size of nuclear power plants (?) which I'm not sure whether is rhetorical or an actual question. The size of the average nuclear power plant, regardless of design, is minuscule compared to the size of a solar panel field or a wind power field needed to produce the equivalent amount of energy, this much should be absolutely clear.

To put most of my concerns about wind and solar into a nutshell, I am very concerned about the scale of the construction projects needed to produce enough energy through either source. Like I've already said, it requires an enormous land mass that becomes unusable for anything else. The size of the construction projects would mean that you're looking at possibly decades of construction time for them to reach full potential, by which time new and groundbreaking developments may have been made in the field of clean energy. It isn't something to rely on, but it is something to take into account.

From the way you describe your take on this, though, I don't think you and I are very far from each other on this in certain parts. I do think solar and wind are also important. For the record I believe replacing nuclear with renewables is incredibly unwise at the current moment and we should instead focus on replacing fossil fuel energy with a combination of both; I am aware that the construction for nuclear is also excruciatingly slow due to bureaucracy and fearmongering about safety, I don't think it's currently viable to fill the energy need with just nuclear — that's where wind, solar and hydro come in. I cannot for the life of me understand why you believe nuclear power in its current form ought to be replaced with renewables when nuclear is still, in essence, a safe, clean and compact form of energy generation with the most noticeable caveat of having to deposit spent fuel and other waste underground. It is also, as someone else already mentioned, good for steady and reliable power generation unaffected by cloudy or windless days, by far the closest option to the current fossil fuel plants in that regard. 

Abolishing current fission energy feels like an incredible waste of resources to me when the only benefits are being able to call yourself 100% renewable and no longer having to dig Onkalo. Technically it would also be more economical according to the LCOE chart you posted, but I still follow the mantra that you shouldn't fix something that isn't broken — don't waste resources decommissioning nuclear plants when they still work and have their own benefits that may very well outweigh the added cost of operation.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/b98cfo/nuclear_energy_in_the_eu/ek3naj8/,ROPROPE,1554386289

Therefore, I do not see why the EU would prefer to grant an extension now, thereby risking that, one year down the line, the UK just pulls this Ace out of their sleeves and puts further strain on EU agenda and timelines.

It is nice that you feel this is more realistic but even in terms of space this means very little. How large are those plants? How much space does waste storage take up? The US already has a problem with nuclear waste whats your proposal for dealing with that?

Renewable energy and battery technology is advancing rapidly. More so than fission energy. Though despite this as I said above it is already more efficient than nuclear energy and it is already viable to turn Europe 100% renewable (http://energywatchgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/EWG-LUT_Full-Study_Energy-Transition-Europe.pdf).

As it looks now nuclear energy is outdated. Yes Thorium reactors may change that but so far there is no indication that they would be more efficient so I don´t really see that happening. Yes they do not produce waste which is great, yes they are safer and yes you can´t use them to build nuclear weapons. But thats about it in terms of benefits compared to Uranium. Thorium is seriously over-hyped on Reddit. 
Now fusion would be a game changer of course. If we do develop a functioning fusion generator it will quickly replace all other forms of energy production. And it would be basically totally clean. Hence why the EU invests a portion of their renewable energy budget on ITER and other fusion research projects.

5673,"Well everything I've said contradicts that so I doubt we'll find common ground here. Needless to say I disagree. Codes are merely extension of government power, so yes people do have that kind of power. It's merely they're vastly more removed from the people they sentence and so can do so without any sentiment towards the people they effect.

I'm sorry but legislative abuse leads to totalitarian regimes whereas judicial abuse just leads to some corruption. 

In my experience common law attracts judges who actively believe in justice and don't just resign themselves to merely enforcing laws regardless of the moral quandries faced. Also I don't understand your point about about justice because codified laws tie judges hands in terms of sentencing. That's not fair to me that's injustice. 

Government power does have to be restricted because of the possibility of tyranny. That doesn't mean government is simply bad.

Your system turns judges into nothing more than enforcers and civil servants. I don't believe that can be justice. 

Furthermore the Napoleonic era was morally horrific and step backwards in so many ways even if it did do away with the aristocracy. It was a completely totalitarian era or violence and moral hardness. Something common law countries are glad to have avoided. 

You put your faith in a abstract rules handed down from on high by politicians if you want.

Actually both the Japanese Empire in the 20th century and the Mongols both did try to colonise as much of the world as they could. Both did some pretty nasty things, that are perfectly well on the same scale of Nazism, Communism, and the Conquistadores.

&gt; we agree that colonialism was the biggest crime in human history, right?

Making hit parades of the biggest crimes in human history seems very silly to me. What was worse, the Mongols, European colonialism, the Aztecs and their human sacrifices, fundamental human rights today in [redacted] majority countries, the holocaust in Nazi Germany, or communism in the Soviet Union, China, and Cambodia?

Chernobyl was the beginning of a grass-roots resistance against nuclear energy across Europe, though it remained somewhat on the fringe, as a popular argument was that event was just a one-off exception, and you can't trust Soviet hackjob tech, this would never happen in the West, etc. Then Fukushima in high-tech Japan happened, [and the electorate's interest in the subject skyrocketed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France#Public_opinion).

The issue isn't even that nuclear power is inherently unsafe -- power plants are subjected to tons of regulations and required to have backups for backups etc. Yet you can never have 100% safety, and the problem is that *if* something big happens, it's a major fuck-up that can throw the entire nation into an [economic crisis](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-nuclear-disaster-cost/major-nuclear-accident-would-cost-france-580-billion-study-idUSBRE91603X20130207), not to mention the consequences for environment and health.

Two, this whole fetish around renewables will be the death of us. Germany spent something like 250 billion dollars on renewable subsidies in the last decade and their emissions still went up. The majority of Europe is just not suited to solar or wind, and both these power sources require standby plants, most often coal or natural gas. Nuclear is the only short term answer capable of reducing CO2 emissions enough to halt large-scale climate change without destroying the economy.

You can like or dislike that the German population has chosen to phase out nuclear power, you can believe that it was done out of misguided fear and so many other reasons.

But the fact remains that the majority of the population at the time was fed up with nuclear energy and wanted it gone. That i disagree with that and i believe we should let the current NPPs run longer however doesn't change the fact that i am in the minority. And i will not belittle the majority just because i put my priorities into mainly the economics of energy.

Torah commandments are divided into negative and positive commandments I.e., something you aren't allowed to do (murder) and something you are supposed to do (give alms). Stoning etc are commandments for punishing criminals for a negative commandment and there are no proper courts to carry them out so you won't have that going on because it wouldn't work and would have innocent people killed for trivial ""crimes"" which are spiritual in nature. 

Circumcision is part of the covenant and it's one of the most important ones. It's a different type of commandment, a positive commandment and it's more personal. 

It's pretty much something that makes a Jewish male. It'll always be at odds with secular humanism from that perspective. If it would be outlawed Jews will do it somewhere else or leave the country possibly. 

Here's more about from a spiritual perspective.

https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1452224/jewish/Why-Circumcise.htm

Note that I'm not defending or attacking the practice either way but explaining why it's so important and why it most likely will never be given up although I have some Jewish friends here who have problems with it but they're less religious than I am... Which isn't much. 

I am one who doesn't have problems with it but can understand why someone would consider it barbaric etc.

Kysy vaan lisää jos kiinnostaa, mut ei tohon oo paljoa lisättävää. Puhtaasti maallisesta näkökulmasta rituaalissa ei ole paljon järkeä ellei ole vakuuttunut, että siitä on terveydelle hyötyä. Ei sitä lopeteta, koska sitä ei oikeasti nähdä haittana. Toisin sanoen, oli juutalainen kuinka nykyaikainen tahansa on hyvin mahdollista, että joku 3000 vuoden takainen rituaali pysyy siitä huolimatta. Voi kuulostaa oudolta, mutta jotkut traditiot ovat vain liian tärkeitä eikä näillä näkymin ole kuolemassa pois.

En kuitenkaan näe miksi ympärileikkausta pitäisi kenenkään muun harjoittaa. Siitä on vain terveyshyötyä jos sinulla on hemmetin huono hygienia ja asut viidakossa.

5890,"&gt;And you think that this will fill up the need for assistance to an equal or greater extent than things in place today?

Yes, absolutely.There will be fewer people who need it and more opportunity to earn money for more obscure jobs

&gt;Not so sure about that, automation removes a lot of those jobs every day.

Automation has been happening for quite a while now - where are those elevator operators nowadays??? 
 
In fact, we can say that the market has changed several times throughout history, right?  How did people overcome these changes?

Well, they don't happen overnight, for one. Automation creates jobs for skilled laborers - engineers, computer scientists, programmers...

So, you can't really say that every person can just go from McDonald's, learn to code, and be super ready for the age of automation, which I think you would say, right?  

But, one key overlooked aspect in this age of automation is the cost of living is going to go dramatically decrease. 

Let's say you have a completely automated farm. The automation is more productive and more effective than anything seen before. This efficiency and productivity reduce the cost of the food from the farm and couple that with no need to pay salaries, healthcare, sick days, or any of that and the cost of food is cheaper.

That means even *un*skilled people have to work less because the food is not as expensive.

What happened during the industrial era? You had to have your kids work, both parents work, and then work 100 hour weeks to be to afford anything. With the advancement in technology, people needed to work fewer hours and the cost of living was less burdensome. 

So, driverless cars will take away all the jobs from taxi and uber drivers (temporariliy). Now prices for driveless taxi rides would decrease because of the afformation productibity and efficiency. This drop in price  in transportation would open up new avenues for new businesses, markets, and jobs where these former drivers could reapply themselves and acquire new skills or leverage existing ones",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/b8u3yn/sweden_wants_to_revive_europes_overnight_trains/ek35l6q/,Ohuma,1554364816
