18,"&gt;And perhaps you should actually read the GDPR laws, there is nothing controversal or extreme in them

I work as a programmer in healthcare, where we have basically been GDPR compliant forever. It is a HUGE amount of investment and trouble. Our systems are designed from the ground up with that compliance in mind, and it costs us literally billions of dollars and tons and tons of time to jump through those hoops. Retrofitting an existing system the size of Google or Facebook for that is frankly a ludicrous, impossible idea and it simply isn't going to happen.

COMPLIANCE COSTS MONEY. That's what folks on the left simply refuse to understand- just because something is a good idea doesn't mean that mandating it is a good idea. The cost-benefit ratio of the GDPR is ridiculously out of whack and I'll be shocked if it's ever enforced at all.

Anyway, if we look at the map with predominant haplogroups Romanians really are the most close to our neighbours, and interestingly, with Sardinians

it should be check some language similarities with some Italian dialects. There is also this

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_sprachbund

all these point more obvious to a common heritage from ancient history eras, probably since the neolithic ""Old European"" civilization, Vinca-Turdas, Cucuteni-Tripolie etc which where centered around the Danube. Later on we have Dacia, Moesia (with a Dacian/Getae/Thracian population) and Thracia (closely related with Dacians, Dacians/Getae were basically the northern Thracians) who covered large parts of today Romania, Bulgaria and Serbia and sourounding areas. On top of that you have the Roman empire controlling as well large parts of these territories and allowing a further mixture.

This why I say Romanians and neighbours share so many things despite we speak different languages (Romance vs Slavic based ones).

85,"Maybe you missed my edit, I expanded the post somewhat. Note especially the part here in parenthesis:

&gt; Granted, this distinction matters a lot less in practice nowadays than it did historically. It mattered when monarchic power was a very real thing, the things mentioned above weren't just a fiction preserved for reasons of tradition but things people very much genuinely believed in, and the ideas of democracy and popular sovereignty were only in their infancy. But nowadays most monarchies keep the forms and traditions of monarchy while in practice de facto adopting the substance of traditional republican ideas (and there are of course reverse cases, with de facto authoritarian pretty-much-monarchic regimes keeping the facade of republican outward forms for PR reasons).

It's about what is official and de jure, not what is de facto. (Well, if you take a descriptive instead of prescriptive stance towards definitions.)

As for Turkey and Russia specifically, I'd note that an authoritarian state can still arguably genuniely be a republic in the sense I described above if it's founded on a sort of crude populist illiberal democracy, where the authoritarian leader doesn't just rule trough brute force but maintains the actual support of the masses. Putin and Erdogan were in fact elected and do likely genuinely have the support of the majority of their populations, and they do claim to hold their power based on the lawful electoral ""will of the people"", not on some kind of traditional divine right or special ""noble"" status, and they don't actually claim to personally literally embody or own the state, no matter their actual power.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/8wr0v3/there_is_still_a_south_american_competitor_in_the/e1zox2d/,Neo24,1531029158

Good think Mario Fernandes was the one scoring that equaliser, because his miss on that penalty shot would have made him a persona non grata in Russia afterwards had he had no previous goal to his name. What a rollercoaster for that fella -- on the one hand, he saved the team, but on the other hand, his penalty was pretty bad, even though his goal during overtime was a much more important and difficult achievement, I'm sure he feels a lot of remorse now about missing that penalty entirely.

See, that's the beauty of football, only one of the 100 reasons why it's called 'The Beautiful Game'. Doping doesn't do much at all in football, it's still ultimately a matter of team tactics, cohesion&amp;flexibility, the player skill, the dexterity of the goalie, the accuracy of the passing, the daring of the forwards.

191,"Well I'd like to have your opinion about this, because I was about to just post this on the France subreddit, the response of the French ambassador to the UN council of human rights.

[link deleted, see below]

The ambassador categorically rejects these recommendations of the report of the high commissioner: 

&gt;Le Comité pour l’élimination de la discrimination raciale a recommandé à la France d’envisager de revoir sa position sur la non-reconnaissance des peuples autochtones des collectivités d’outre-mer, et de veiller à conduire des politiques mieux ciblées et adaptées aux besoins et à la situation spécifique de ces populations, notamment les peuples autochtones et les personnes d’ascendance africaine. Le Comité des droits de l’homme a estimé que la France devrait réexaminer sa position concernant la reconnaissance officielle des minorités ethniques, religieuses ou linguistiques.

&gt;Le Comité des droits économiques, sociaux et culturels a recommandé à la France de promouvoir le droit des personnes appartenant à des groupes linguistiques régionaux ou minoritaires et, dans les DROM-COM, des peuples autochtones, de pratiquer leur propre langue dans les régions où les langues régionales sont traditionnellement parlées.

&gt;Concernant la Guyane française, le Comité pour l’élimination de la discrimination raciale a recommandé à la France d’envisager la reconnaissance des droits communautaires pour les peuples autochtones, en particulier le droit aux terres ancestrales, détenues et utilisées par ces communautés depuis des temps immémoriaux, ainsi que le droit à leurs ressources.

The 'egality' and the 'same rights' of France by its very virtue, ignores or denies the specialness of the indigenous peoples of Guyane. They actually SHOULD have special rights by virtue of being indigenous to their lands, such as for example, the ability to use and teach their languages and promote them, all of these languages are under serious threat by French (French seriously threatens languages in French Polynesia as well and elsewhere). I mean this egality thing about France is actually oppressive ironically.

[edit] Okay, the FB link got deleted, it appears Reddit doesn't allow me to post FB links, and I can't find any other video to the meeting, but the ambassador is François Croquette and the meeting was held on 28/06/2018. In the video he rejects categorically the ratification of the Convention n.169, and uses arguments like 'no we don't recognise the concept of autochtone people, we don't make distinctions based on identity etc'.

216,"&gt;complete invention of the Catalan situation

The fuck, read about felipe gonzalez de-industrialisation and crisis in 92 in Murcia

&gt;Like really Catalan independentists dont hate you, and dont hate Spain

The fuck, ofc they don't hate us, it's us the spaniard who hate them, right? It can be otherwise. Catalans are absolutely lovely toward Spain, there has beeen never insults, or comentaries about how Catalans are superior and Spaniards are semi africans. It's always the Spaniards who are fascist. They actually love Spaniards so much they try to show its feats to the world, like with that woman with the false blood they tried to pass around. Very lovely love

&gt;they dislike what in some aspects the country has become, which is fair.

Ofc it's fair, **I** am disgusted by the political aspects of this country. But that doesn't make me say it's other people who are responsible, or that they are retarded, and it doesn't make me try to leave Spain instead of trying to make it better. **A lot of people in Spain dislike the situation**, not only that, with the catalans we had weight to change things. Now they are trying to leave all the people who wanted change behind, treating us as retarded, stealing us political power, and taking with them all the industrial inversions they gave to the region.

.

I guess because you are basque you don't realise certain aspect of how a country works, but there is something ( that I already said before) that modifies the faces of a country: it's brain drain. The same way people from shity villages go to the city, in Spain people from Murcia, extremadura &amp; Castilla la mancha have no other way than to leave for northern regions, because the industrial net is very scarse. The oportunities of these regions aren't big, and the fact that prepared people, engineers, architects, and what not, leave for those parts of the country, let the region they come from even more scarse. I don't know any friend of mine who is engineer and stayed where I'm from, they are all, guess where? Madrid, Barcelona. And I would bet when it comes to finding job you never had the forced option to move away from your land, am I wrong?

So now, after years where certain parts of Spain having been left behind, some even stolen ( seriously, read about the Cartagena crisis of 92), the regions of Spain where **all the progresist and intelectuals** went are sudenly saying the rest is shit. That's exactly like saying Village people are shit because you live in the city. Extremely offensive, very demagogicly chauvinistic, and rooted from a pretentious ignorance of how the world works.




So no, don't come with the ""catalan people don't hate you"" or that kind of shit. If they had any kind of respect for Spain they would have the decency to reciprocate all the inversions, phisical as human, with the simple act of trying to improve Spain.

Also **It is clear you don't have an example where Europeans immigrants integrate to non European cultures. :)**

It worked out so great.  Since you support this unwarranted action by the *North Atlantic* Treaty Organization to engage in offensive warfare in the Sahara you shouldn't cry about the consequences. 

Why do Europeans go to foreign countries and forcibly make them abide by their values when the reverse doesn't happen?

&gt; You mean like buying out all your flag car/tech/entertainment brands?

Did the part with the taxes even reach your brain?   
How is it you never even wondered why all this money is not being invested into Chinas prosperity?   

They are fleeing China. Getting the money into safe places and since they want to keep it growing and running, we don't give a damn? You already stole most of the tech. Why should a worker at a car company (partially) owned by some Chinese businessman care who signs his cheque? At least the stuff they produce is being bought. Probably even in China because your cars suck ;)

&gt; I don't spit but spitting doesn't have the same ring in most Asian cultures as it does in the West, though this is changing nowadays.

You don't have to sell spitting to me. I don't care. 

If I travel to Asia (or any other part of the planet), I adapt to the customs there. My government doesn't have to tell me that. My parents and my culture educated me to be a civilized human being.

You coming here and shitting on Europe considering that Chinese people are known to be the most uncivilized visitors from a (looking from outside) civilized country is preposterous. But also funny in a very special way.  
And I'm not even talking about the dirt and feces you're confronted with in China itself. I haven't seen anybody here letting their kid shit on the street. You?

Yeah we're so fucked you comment under a thread praising a city in the country that is at the top of the export nations on this planet for quite some time and it's just one small european country if you compare it to China. Think about it.

378,"Many reasons. Among them are:

1. Germany actually has no traditional metropolises , despite having by far the largest population of central and western Europe. Probably a result of our fractured national history. It is not economically viable to build an expensive Skyscraper in the inner cities when one could just go into an economic development zone on the outskirts, easily reachable through good infrastructure.

2. it also has few really huge companies compared to the power of its economy. (one indicator: 4th largest economy in the world, but only 29 corporations on the Fortune 500 list). So there is less concentration of wealth and less potential for companies trying to build themselves a landmark.

3. Zoning Laws I. Germany prefers mixed development over pure business districts in the inner cities. It is hard to find inner city plots here where you dont have to deal with a myriad of legacy tenants

4. Zoning Laws II. Germany, like most european countries, prefers to have historic buildings shape the skylines.

407,"\&gt;  French Guiana is decolonized

You must be joking.

## Transformation, as seen in French Guiana, is not decolonisation.  Decolonising the curriculum is far more nuanced than replacing  theorists and authors. If “curriculum” encompasses a broader educational  experience, universities first need to define how they approach the  development and dissemination of curricula. Only then can they move  forward with the process of decolonisation.

I’d like to focus particularly on curriculum as context and as  praxis. These approaches seem to align well with my definition of  “decolonising the curriculum”. A contextual approach opens the door for  universities to critique how curriculum – and therefore education –  reproduces unequal social relations after graduation.

Praxis creates conditions to democratise learning spaces. It makes  room for both individual and group identities within the teaching and  learning context. This creates shared and negotiated understandings and  practices while knowledge is being generated and disseminated.

Universities that wish to decolonise their curricula could benefit  from understanding these approaches. This might also help people to stop  conflating transformation – another imperative at universities and in  French Guiana more broadly – with decolonisation.",,/r/europe/comments/8wr0v3/there_is_still_a_south_american_competitor_in_the/e1ywo6g/,DerekSavageCoolCuck,1530997644

That's what he said: ""Protestants believe salvation comes only from faith and not also from good works"".

&gt;That didn't fit too well into the churches involvement with the nobility.

what? how is it relevant to the reform? luther was pretty anti-plebeian and the reform worked because it had many noble protectors, parly using it against the emperor and the pope. 

&gt;After the common man started to read the bible and not just follow what the priests told them, a lot of theological differences developed since they learned that what the catholics preached might not actually be in line with the bible.

Actually no, luther started to devellop the doctrinal divergences progressively, and the doctrine of the reform certainly wasn't built by the ""common man"" but by learned men like Luther and calvin who didn't wait the reform to read the bible.

The printing press amplified the reform and the theological controverses, it didn't cause it. Also you're  explaining only the translation issue in term of ""the oppressive  clergy didn't want people to think by themselves"", but there was the big issue is that translation is always a betrayal of the original, and thus doing a translation of a sacred scripture is delicate, controversial, and often considered a bit like printing apocryphes.

503,"&gt; The case did invopve the stolen tech. It's highly publicized.

So, have you read the patent claims then? In the original Mandarin Chinese? Do you even know what a patent claim is? Did Micron contest the ownership of the patent, its validity, or only the infringement? Do you have any clue about what I'm talking about, or are you relying only on reports from journalists equally ignorant about technology, patent law and the Chinese language, and relying in turn on the press releases from a single party in high-stakes, high-complexity, international litigation?

&gt; For example if a US or European company stole tech and then sued the original owner to slcease and desist 9/10 times the courts would come to the right conclusion. 

Well, it certainly isn't anywhere as clear-cut as that. If you're hit with a patent infringement lawsuit, and the patent concerns in fact an invention that was stolen from you, you may file a counterclaim for ownership of the patent, but then you have to prove that the invention was indeed taken from you and not developed independently by the patentee. And, believe me, proving that is extremely difficult **anywhere**.

&gt; But over and over Western companies lose in China even if they are in the right.

This is not what I've heard directly from (non-Chinese) litigators. (What's more problematic, sometimes, is getting judgments enforced). So, what's your source?

&gt; That said, you agree everything in my comment is true and your answer is ""well we should just be more like China"".

I'm afraid that your reading comprehension is really lacking, if you've understood me like that.

You say that and Ireland says something else, but even the other point (on which we agree) is enough - that border checks along the UK-Ireland border are unacceptable to Ireland and the EU.

&gt;It is about who has the right to settle, not about who has the right to travel.

It is not about formalities. It is about whether you have to stop and show your passport when crossing from Ireland to the UK.

If you don't - then the UK has no control over its borders, which is the basic promise of May's cabinet. If you don't then any Pole or Romanian can travel to the UK with London having no say.

683,"&gt; But that's not the ECJ legislating? That is the ECJ telling that Dutch law is against EU law. Which it seems to have been.

No that's microlegislation; the law itself is ambiguous as hell and courts ""rule"" whether something is against the law which isn't a finding of fact but their own opinion really.

In Dutch legal culture the court essentially asks the legislative to clarify the law for this specific case rather than it being the job of the court to interpret the vagueness—this is to avoid unelected people from having the power to fill in the gaps; the courts find fact but do not essentially create legislation with precedent.

&gt; Are you suggesting that EU member countries don't need to follow EU directives? Wouldn't that undermine the entire union? Should all EU legislation be optional?

I'm saying that the directive is utterly vague and that in Dutch legal culture such vaguenesses are purposefully disambiguiated by the legislative and not by the courts.

The directive says that member states shall provide for ""exclusive rights to reproduction"" to the copyright holder with little more definition of what that is; the Netherlands has always interpreted downloading or taping of the radio as not a form of reproduction because it's a personal copy. If you argue that all forms of personal copy are ""reproduction"" then you don't even have the right to make a backup of your own stuff.

The ECJ has ruled that downloading and taping is not a ""personal copy"" but the directive itself in no way establishes that; that's just the court's own opinion and that's exactly the kind of stuff that Dutch legal culture hopes to avoid with strict parliamentary sovereignty that the opinion of courts can't create microlegislation like that and that clearing up such ambiguities in the law is the responsibility of the legislative.",Dat is allemaal helemaal niet nodig hoor.,/r/europe/comments/8wtl2r/uks_government_12_key_principles_for_brexit/e1yise7/,Homoerotic_Theocracy,1530983869

714,"&gt; Remember when you spoke of those ""defining traits"" and hair is an iconic trait defining the species? To me, the iconic human trait is sexual dimorphism, meaning that men should look like men and women like women.

And hair isn't a form of human sexual dimorphism. Both males and females grow long hair so by cutting off male hair you are making them no longer look like males.

In fact since male hair grows slightly faster and longer than female hair it's inverted world. If anything you should be cutting off female hair.

&gt; A trait attractice in a woman can have the opposite effect in a man and vice versa, and this is not sexism, it's appreciation of both sexes as what they are.

It's literally making a distinction on sex; that's what sexism is.

Cologne is an example of a settlement preserving this etymology. Other, less obvious settlements that began as Roman colonia include cities from Belgrade to York. A tell-tale sign of a settlement once being a Roman Colony is a city centre with a grid pattern.[2] The terminology is taken from architectural analogy, where a column pillar is beneath the (often stylized) head capital, which is also a biological analog of the body as subservient beneath the controlling head (with 'capital' coming from the Latin word caput, meaning 'head').

769,"&gt;Main articles: Names of the Albanians and Albania and Albania (name) In the 2nd century BC, the History of the World written by Polybius, mentions a location named Arbona (Greek: Ἄρβωνα; Latinised form: Arbo)[24][25] in which some Illyrian troops, under Queen Teuta, scattered and fled to in order to escape the Romans. Arbona was perhaps an island[26][non-primary source needed] in Liburnia or another location within Illyria.[27][citation needed]

There's no link between Albanians and Illyrians


&gt;In the 2nd century AD, Ptolemy, the geographer and astronomer from Alexandria, drafted a map that shows the city of Albanopolis, located Northeast of Durrës) in the Roman province of Macedonia and the tribe of Albanoi,[28] which were viewed as Illyrians by later historians.[29][30][31][32][33]

They probably are, still squat to do with todays Albanians  

&gt;In the 6th century AD, Stephanus of Byzantium, in his important geographical dictionary entitled Ethnica (Ἐθνικά),[34] mentions a city in Illyria called Arbon (Greek: Ἀρβών), and gives an ethnic name for its inhabitants, in two singular number forms, i.e. Arbonios (Greek: Ἀρβώνιος; pl. Ἀρβώνιοι Arbonioi) and Arbonites (Greek: Ἀρβωνίτης; pl. Ἀρβωνῖται Arbonitai). He cites Polybius[34] (as he does many other times[35][36] in Ethnica).

Still no link that these are related to todays Albanians  

&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Albania/Cultural-institutions#ref476152

It's easy to link yourself to something when it's your official state doctorine, and there is no consensus between historians, that's why it says *some*.

825,"&gt; Serbia used systematic violence against Kosovo and the international community helped it to form their own state.

First and foremost while it doesn't excuse any war crimes our actions were a response to their terrorist group, the KLA. We did not start the war.

Second, this all happened almost 10 years before they declared independence. 

Third, the international community did not help them form their own state. NATO attacked us and we eventually gave in, but after that the UN approved resolution 1244, which guaranties our territorial integrity and sovereignty over Kosovo, as such making their independence illegal. So the international community agreed that Kosovo would stay part of Serbia.

Fourth and final, both are essentially theft, Kosovo on NATO's part, Crimea on Russia's. It's just that you Baltic people are so much in love with NATO and hate Russia that you won't admit their wrongdoings.

The game between England and Portugal was to be played in Liverpool, but just days before the match it was ""decided"" that the game would be played in Wembley, forcing the Portuguese to make a long unplanned trip by train to the venue, disrupting the natural flow of the competition.

Considering Portugal's performance that year (eliminating Pelé's Brasil and Hungary) and Eusébio's genius, many here believe that if the game had been played in Liverpool the outcome would be different.

Of course, because it is after genocide. Even in Ukraine inside after several genocides some big cities already have mostly Russian majority (sic!). Of couse, there is also can be pro-Russian (statistic) propaganda. Here were also later Soviet politics of industrilization: transportation cheap Russian hands for works. Very close situation with Baltic countries: without famine genocide but with repression — and several territory there are like Russian (mostly correcter post-Soviet) «getto». As we see, Russia still doesnʼt changed and still terrors many weaker nations as Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine etc. Batlic countries here is more safely cause NATO. Yes, on «Povolzye» were not only Ukrainians but also Tatars and other Turkic nations. Even [Kazaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_famine_of_1919–1922) were genocided on their own territories. 

Yeah, Russian also have suffered оn those territory (as today in occupited territory or even in Russia who doesnʼt agree with dictator line), but it was mostly Russian chauvinismʼs actions against non-Russian ethnics. 

_Added_.

You can hear from pro-clasic-Russian man, that Ukraine is repressing minority language (which is partly false, bacause Ukraine tries to cure Muscovization results) but Russia doesnʼt do it.

1080,"That'd be a start, that'd have some vision and direction, but even then I do not believe it would work out in much of Europe.

In countries like Ireland, Norway, Finland yeah sure, numerically the illegal migrant proportion is low, national identity has not been so fractured and assimilation or at worst integration is manageable. In other places the demographics and social attitudes are so disintegrated that creating a coherent nation out of the fighting tribes isn't going to happen, there's no appetite for it from anyone.

The Middle East, where Europe, Africa and Asia collide isn't known for its peacefulness. The more we shape our societies to look like it, with an arbitrary state ruling over tribal communities with corrupted democracy, the more we'll become it. Not dreadfully at first, just a nice slow glide into chaos to become like Lebanon.

Some parts of Europe will be fine, others will not. Some parts of Europe will find soft solutions, others will become more authoritarian in assimilation like Singapore and God forbid others become fascistic, it's not like it hadn't happened before. I think we'll see some regionalism emerge as nationalities disintegrate and states seem more arbitrary, e.g. Bretagne, Scotland, Bavaria, Catalonia. Though that's far ahead.

We need to get good leaders and good people in power though, our current crop cannot handle this, some are just too damn old. They have a baby boomer rosy outlook and perception of Europe's place in history. Sheer naive belief that war and history is over, it really isn't.

There's no equally popular team/ball sport with more top teams that ""have a chance"" yet all those smaller sports arrange ""World Cups"" or ""World Championships"". (And I don't even mean baseball's ""World Series"" since it is not a competition between nations).

The top 4 is going to be entirely different from 2014 and last year's champion (Germany) didn't make it through the group stage and last year's 3rd placed Netherlands didn't even manage to qualify for the tournament. That should say something about the level of competition even if only a handful of nations have a realistic chance to win.

1313,"Passing a formal condemnation is already a huge symbol, and the Security Council has, in theory, the power to pass economic sanctions as well. Of course you could argue that this wouldn't keep one of the major powers from ignoring such measures ... but on the other hand, we're witnessing right now what happens when large nations are cutting themselves off of trade.

And you'd be kinda contradicting yourself if it were otherwise -- UN Resolutions cannot simultaneously be so useless that the US/Russia/China wouldn't care, yet important enough that they'd cling to their veto powers no matter what.

It's also not so much about stopping the activities of the US, China or Russia themselves, but rather the influence they exert over various proxies, at times allowing humanitarian crises to fester. If the Security Council were to pass a resolution conserning Syria or the Gaza Strip, Russia and the US can huff and puff all they want, but it wouldn't change how the rest of the world acts.

&gt; The US and UK usually veto together. The only things that the US vetoes by itself are things related to Israel whenever the general assembly wants to say bad things about it. Those aren't really substantive, just political.

Out of the US' 80 vetoes, the UK joined 9, and the other 71 were not all just about Israel -- though I'd argue that the ongoing situation there is substantive enough, too.

&gt; How much have those treaties done for human rights? Nothing.

Many of these treaties form the framework of international standards, including European law. You shouldn't assume that just because some countries do not care, this mindset would somehow apply to the entire world.

Power comes, first and foremost, from the rule of law. The global community isn't the Wild West, and in spite of their penchant for faits accompli, even the US, Russia and China understand this, else they wouldn't bother keeping up appearances this much. Granted, the US is currently ruled by an administration that thinks differently, but look how the rest of the world reacts -- a big gun alone doesn't build trust, and trust is the coinage of global diplomacy.

That's not to say that I do not believe in military intervention, of course. Quite the opposite -- but I am disappointed in how often even the potential gets sabotaged because various crises are actually in the interest of one of the veto powers.

1337,"&gt;Passing a formal condemnation is already a huge symbol, and the Security Council has, in theory, the power to pass economic sanctions as well. Of course you could argue that this wouldn't keep one of the major powers from ignoring such measures ... but on the other hand, we're witnessing right now what happens when large nations are cutting themselves off of trade.

The Security council is symbolic even when it passes sanction anyway. You don't need security council permission to levy sanctions. We have sanctions on Russia right now.

&gt;Many of these treaties form the framework of international standards, including European law. You shouldn't assume that just because some countries do not care, this mindset would somehow apply to the entire world.

It doesn't matter if its Martian law. The treaties are meaningless because there is no enforcement mechanism. There is no standards being enforced. This is the mindset everywhere.

European countries have put themselves voluntarily under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights to enforce the ECHR. There is not broad mechanism to just enforce the UN Human Rights Treaties. No country would ever agree to that outside of maybe some idealistic Northern European countries. The rest of the world values the idea of sovereignty too much.

&gt;Power comes, first and foremost, from the rule of law. The global community isn't the Wild West, and in spite of their penchant for faits accompli, even the US, Russia and China understand this, else they wouldn't bother keeping up appearances this much. The US is currently ruled by an administration that thinks differently, but look how the rest of the world reacts -- a big gun alone doesn't build trust, and trust is the coinage of global diplomacy.

Power comes from power, not the rule of law. The US does whatever it wants. This isn't just the Trump administration. Obama, Bush, Clinton, and previous presidents have always been more than willing to act unilaterally. The US tries to keep up appearances when possible, but just because it's cheap and easy to at least make the effort to.

And how did the rest of the world react? They do nothing. When the US invaded Iraq, the rest of the world huffed and puffed, then did nothing. That's  got nothing to do with trust, that's just realpolitik. Same thing when the US invaded Panama, bombed Libya, Invaded Grenada, Vietnam, bombed Cambodia. Power comes from having guns and being willing to use them. The rest of the world doesn't care enough to do anything about it, especially if the US is not a threat compared to the USSR's or Russias over the world.

&gt;That's not to say that I do not believe in military intervention, of course. Quite the opposite -- but I am disappointed in how often even the potential gets sabotaged because various crises are actually in the interest of one of the veto powers. Remove them, and you could have the UN do its job.

Who needs the UN? Russia vetoed the UN resolution on Syria, the US still has troops in Syria. You can intervene in a country without the UN. The US does it all the time.

\- ""Essential links such as marriages between Russian and European noble houses did not exist""

The most famous counter-example is probably Anne of Kiev. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne\_of\_Kiev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Kiev)  
And even Ivan the Terrible was in correspondence with Queen Elizabeth, suggesting marriage to her. Which she, of course, rejected.

\-  ""Even the 30 Years War and the peace conferences thereafter, that defined the European political sphere, included no participation from Russia.""

Ironically, 30 Years War is an example of European war that actually had participation from Russia. Cardinal Richeleiu sent an embassy to Russia and convinced Russia to join the Anti-Habsburg coalition. Russia then entered war with catholic Poland (which was pro-Habsburg) and subsidized Sweden (by lowering tariffs for bread export).

&gt;Marie-France Garaud, a Gaullist advisor to French President Georges Pompidou and later Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, accused him of the destruction of the nation's sovereignty and reproached him for his wish of a federal Europe. She considers he was part of an American expectancy to build Europe in order to weaken France's power, and claimed in the talkshow Ce soir (ou jamais!): ""He was an American agent. We even know how much he was paid, as it's now declassified"".

Yeah and a webpage that has more content uploaded than can be humanly posible to check will use what exactly to uphold this responsibility? I guess bots.

Public domain songs and images later put into movies or songs that become trouble again for some reason. Random claims can easily cause content to be deleted or its generated revenue to be withheld, which doesn't hurt the sharing site. In the end it will be us who will have to take up the responsibility of fighting for our own uploads to stick and be uploaded to sites in the first place with counter claims being an easy way to silence some stuff.

1450,"I think you may be reading this wrong. So in the conclusion notes to last weeks summit there was an addendum hint from the EU that if May ""blurred her red lines"" the EU would budge on some things. So then May hinted back that she would do just that. Then later this week you saw Barnier was using the same language ""blur red lines"".

Then she shuffled off and cobbled together an open-ended plan that she could just about fly by 8 pro-Brexit cabinet members. That was the meeting today at Chequers, she basically locked them all in a room and managed to neuter any immediate government challenges and internal politics from the likes of Davies, Gove and Johnson.

Now what she has, is this hand wavey, very loose position that allows her to go back to the EU and pretty much fold on a fair few things but still hold to the original Lancaster House speech... ""Brexit means Brexit"", ""Out of common agriculture policy, common fisheries, ECJ, common market"" etc. etc. Except now she has full permission to kick the can down the road and actually stay in a fair few things and explain it away as temporary to the people that voted for Brexit.

So it isn't that they all agreed on a position of getting everything under the sun, they just agreed on how to live up to the previous words by technicality only when they will probably fold on a bit more from the EU side.

At the end of the day, she doesn't want to leave the same way others do, so if she can just about allow people to leave in name only and strike up a trade deal or two then that is a win in her book (since it is a catch-22 at this point).

It is a bit like the referendum we had here in Sweden in 1955, the government asked us ""Do you want us to stop driving on the left"", everyone voted no and the idea was rejected and the powers that be in the government that wanted to do the change lost badly. To save face, a few years later they switch to driving to the right anyway and then said that it was not stipulated how long do you want to keep driving on the left. Classic face saving bullshit.

Of course, the EU always said it wouldn't go for this sort of deal, so it remains to be seen how much the ""blurring red lines"" thing gets you.

1462,"&gt;I really don't think that's it. There have been a number of passionately argued Resolutions that could have addressed humanitarian crises or violations of human rights that were simply shot down by veto power against the will of the majority

What resolutions? You need the veto power for these kinds of things for a bunch or reasons. For example, if there was a general assembly motion for a UN intervention in Syria then Russia would oppose it because Russia has troops there and support Assad. A UN intervention cannot fight Russian troops even if there were a general assembly motion. That's why the major powers can veto it. It's a necessary thing. 

&gt;The question is really just what sort of trigger it'll take for the rest of the world to consider reform against three nations, i.e. just walking away and reassembling as they had enough.

It's 5 nations, not 3. Nobody is going to do anything about it. 

The only thing that really matters at the security council is authorizing UN internvetnions. That's what really matters, and you need all major powers on board with that anyway.

1711,"Initially, the UNPA would just be about the democratization of existing UN processes, but it's true that in the long run, there are hopes that a global Parliamentary Assembly could be the first step to some sort of global governance, backed by the will of Earth's people. The exact frameworks are still very much open to debate and there are several models of how it could be implemented or how much power it'd have.

In a way, it would likely end up as some sort of confederation or federation, where national governments retain sovereignty but agree to implement shared policies not unlike with the EU or the US (to pull some wildly different examples for different degrees of federalization). Cooperation would of course have to be based on nations honoring the treaties and conditions they agreed upon as members of this league, so there'd always be the risk of someone just saying ""no"", but all in all, this *has* so far worked out nicely for the EU, too.

This wikipedia page has some interesting information on the various proposals: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Parliamentary_Assembly

&gt; This call may have had more influence, if the EU would have successfully reformed itself first, why are they focusing on the UN instead of the more immediate concerns of EU reform.

Well, so far this is just a sign of general support that didn't take much time to organize, and that won't have any consequences beyond some good feelings. On the other hand, the vote also shows there is a clear democratic will to support this initiative, and as more and more nations sign on, it may some day turn into something real.

The EU itself will continuously evolve and harmonize the legislation of its Member States, anyways -- though I doubt we will see major reforms that will turn it into something else than this trifecta of Council, Parliament and Commission. National governments would likely refuse handing power to the Parliament, and abolishing the Parliament would mean reducing the EU's level of democracy. The Commission, meanwhile, is just the EU's equivalent to ministers. The basic concept is sound, but there'll always be *some* potential for discord, the level of which depending on how much people will identify with the EU as a whole compared to favoring national identities, i.e. whether they see the EU as a battleground between national interests, or a cooperation for the greater good.

The US is a union of states as well, if you think about it, it just has a way more solid shared identity due to the long history and the various crises it has gone through. Maybe the EU will be the same -- and maybe a hypothetical UN world government would be, too. I certainly think it'll have to reform if it wants to survive rather than disappearing into nonrelevance.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8wmaim/eu_parliament_calls_for_un_reform_and/e1wpabp/,akashisenpai,1530904208

Claiming that no one should acknowledge these things is childish. 

Do you think the Armenian genocide shouldn’t be acknowledged simply because people won’t acknowledge issues because they were born there? Or does being absolved of responsibility only apply to those of European descent? 

It’s easy to say hindsight is 20/20, it’s not yours, your children’s and your grandchildren’s futures which disappeared.  

And to correct you, the effort was pushed by France and the Uk and only saw significant American involvement after the European militaries couldn’t do their jobs. 

Edit: also, sending foreign aid while preventing the same countries from accessing their own money and resources defeats the point. 

Maybe instead of sending meagre amounts yearly let these countries access more than just 15% of their currency reserves (I’m looking at you, France). 

Not only are they prevented from accessing their own reserves, they are forced to take loans from France at commercial rates while giving France first dibs on the extraction of minerals.

1757,"&gt;No, monopolies are not good, if you really think so you've never taken a single business class. A monopoly has sole control over an area and has enough resources to **forbid competitors to join the market**. The entire concept of the free market bases on competition (if you're doing your job badly, someone else will gladly take it), but if you're using infrastructural advantages to enforce a monopoly that you're not supposed to have then **capitalism will fail** as you no longer need to provide an acceptable service. That is why monopoly laws are an example of a *good* business law.

You are not thinking through any of thr examples you provided. How do monopolies keep competitors out? They either lower their prices so low that the other business goes bankrupt, or they buy it out. Both of which are good for the consumer. This is exactly why Standard Oil was so cheap, they would take a loss if it meant putting competitors who refused to sell out of business. Again, this is absolutely fantastic for the consumer, and monopolies **always offer the lowest prices.**  

&gt;Another law that does its job is the patent law; thanks to patent laws, research can actually be made without having to fear getting that research stolen every moment. Without patent laws, there'd be no point in doing research, as you could just wait for your competitor to do something and steal their idea. This pushes scientific and technological advancements immensely.

On the patent law, the only reason the quality of life of people in China improved so fast over the last 20 years was from the deliberate breaking of US patent and copyright law. China copies and stole thousands of American ideas and it literally made China one of the richest countries in the world. To think people would stop making ideas is rediculous. Say I invented the lightbulb, if I started a company it would take years before I could mass market lightbulbs, but if Comcast just copied my idea they would be able to mass market the idea in months. As you could see, this would benefit the consumer. You say that if people had the idea to build a lightbulb, but there was no copyright law, they would just not make it??? That seems rather rediculous to me. The gutenberg press wasnt patented, niether was guns of gunpowder, niether was the plow or axe or any other early human invention. Some people will invent stuff because they dont care about the fame or glory. Others will sell off their ideas to big companies. Some will start their own business and then sell it off. Some will start their own business and then refuse to sell it off and get their idea stolen. Even then though, that person now has on their resume that they invented the lightbulb amd they could be highered as a creative director or be sponsered by a monarch to go full time on making inventions. There are many options for people with great ideas, many that can make money. But in the end all that matters is the consumer, and the consumer benefits, like in China, when there are no copyright laws.

Next, any time you illegalize boycotts society collapses. The monarch is overthrown and that's the end of that. Food safety was originally invented to help poor not get sick from street food. The law does not help the middle class like you claim. The middle class always bought higher class food from providers who had a history of having good product. All food safety did was increase the price of poor-person food, and made it illegal to sell food in the street. Poor people are still starving as a result. Poor people have to spend so much money on food that it is extremely difficult for them to save money.If you remove food safety, poor people could buy cheap street food and actually be able to save money. Food safety should be abolished, it literally only hurts the poor people.

People could afford to make their music by being sponsered by a rich patreon. Just like Leonardo was sponsered by many very wealthy men, that sponsering would not die. in fact it would allow more artists to compete. As people are more likely to support you if they pay less taxes. It's proven people give more charity when they pay less taxes.

How the fuck is my view communistic? Communism and socialism are two of the worst dogshit economic systems that led to the starvation of millions of Ukrainian farmers. You obviously have no fucking idea what you are talking about, I'm advocating for free market solutions. That is the exact opposite of communism. I want to cut taxes for any reason at anytime anywhere. I think the market has proven that it can solve any difficult issue much better than a government could mandate out the same issue. I think democracy is a huge failure, as people will undoubtedly begin voting to give themselves money. The only sustainable economic system is a monarchy with no to low taxes. We already see declining birth rates in every rich country. Our population is stabilizing at a sustainable point. Any time a good is limited the price goes up meaning its going to be used less. We will never run out of oil for the same reason we will never run out of gold.

Small news companies whose only lifeline was the minuscule amount of clicks it got from reddit would be killed by the passing of article 13. Google is not going to risk getting sued so it will just not show ANY LINKS unless it gets approval first. Google just cuts their loses and tries not to infringe on any copyright. Meaning every small business would instantly sink. The internet has opened up so many new news outlets that never existed 30 years ago. That's the end of the story. Article 13 is just another regulation that kills small business. If you want to have a good economy less laws are better, as people just follow the laws of the free market.

And yes, it does cover dental. For everyone.

1856,"I see that you are definitely for filters, because you think it's the only possible solution. On the other hand, I am definitely against filters, because I think it's a too invasive way to approach the problem. Therefore, this discussion can last forever :)

&gt; I wouldn't say it's ""good"", just that it's not a deal-breaker for me personally. It's enough to get a grasp what a story is about in general (e.g. copyright, or Obama in Poland)

True, but there's a problem if you want to search for an article which covers something more than just the fact that Obama visited Poland. It's not convenient to click every single publication to check it more thoroughly as a search engine can't show a part longer than X words. This is why I opt for a precise definition of an insubstantial part which is not as absurd as the 7-word recommendation.

&gt; Ultimately, because freedom of speech doesn't override copyright -- save for purposes of review or criticism already provided for in existing copyright law, which wouldn't change under the Directive. Else people could just stream a new movie and claim an exception for freedom of expression; arguably, this is not okay.

I will ask again: is it technically possible for a filter to distinguish legitimate use of copyright protected content from the illegitimate use so that users exercising copyright exceptions do not meet obstacles every time they upload their videos? I agree that freedom of expression is not an excuse for streaming a new movie.

&gt; But also because the existing original, copyrighted material makes it a lot easier to automatically identify infringement. In case of, say, hate speech or terrorism, this would be a lot more difficult since the content cannot be automatically analyzed -- unless you'd block everything based on certain words like ""bomb"" or ""nigger"" or ""feminazi"". But unlike with copyright-infringing material, the number of content that would unfairly get caught in a filter would be much higher, since there's no ability to recognize the context in which the words were used.

(EDITED)

I'd argue with this view. Firstly, you also have a lot of contents containing hate speech, terrorism stuff etc. In today's computer science, algorithms utilizing artificial neural networks (kind of artificial intelligence in simple terms) can be trained on these contents so that they can recognize similar illegal content in user uploads. Therefore, there is technology which can be used to filter e.g. hate speech in a way similar to filtering copyright infringing content, but (1) you're right that it's difficult to identify the context, (2) nobody proposes a law which makes it compulsory. Why (2)? See my previous comment. Secondly, the context of using copyrighted content is not always obvious. I'd rather say that this is as complex as hate speech, terrorism etc.

&gt; On the other hand, a video whose audio track has a 99% match with copyrighted content? Yep, sounds like a solid case.

No, it doesn't. For example: https://youtu.be/KHZ8ek-6ccc

I'm pretty sure that the material used in the video is copyrighted and the audio track match is (nearly) 100%. However, the video can be considered a parody which is a copyright exception in some Member States.

&gt; Exactly, which is crap. Under the Directive: (etc.)

""More solid evidence"": I think a rightholder couldn't think of more solid evidence than the fact that their track exactly matches mine, even though their track is an illegal copy of another music.

""You would only have to contact YT, and they have to sort it out for you"": By contacting the rightholder or by consulting the YT legal team? What if a site doesn't have a copyright legal team?

""The platform now has a responsibility towards both rightholder and user"": What if a rightholder and a user have different views on the same video? A court? I don't know if I want to go to a court because of a short video from family holidays...even if I don't have to, resolving the copyright issue here with a court might take some amount of time.

It's good that the directive wants to make the complaint mechanism as fair as possible, but I'm afraid that this wouldn't affect much the scale of abuse similar to my case.

&gt; Under the Council version, small and micro businesses would be exempt from automatic filtering anyways, and just required to take-down upon claims by a rightholder -- so, how YT works now.

True, based on the recital 38e of the Council version, **but** this is not how YT works now. YT has an automated copyright filter called the Content ID, in addition to the possibility of filing claims by rightholders.

&gt; (...) rightholders can send takedown notices and a platform could decide to take it down. (...)

&gt; However, it also means that the really bad material - blatant infringement on copyright - will just get uploaded by someone else, whereas a honest user caught unfairly will either have a lot of stress to go through (like you) or has to accept their original content remaining removed unless they want strikes on their channel.

I didn't receive a claim from the rightholder. It was the result of...an automated filter!

This is where I'd like to point out one important thing I've completely forgotten to mention before: automated filters **can be fooled**. Today, many materials on YouTube are slightly modified to bypass its Content ID system. This is why ""the really bad material (...) will just get uploaded"", as you said. Introducing a legal obligation of using automated filters will not solve that issue.

In short: article 13 might not reduce significantly the scale of copyright infringement.

&gt; In short, ""innocent until proven guilty"" just doesn't work on the web, so ultimately the question is whether you are willing to give up actual enforcement of copyright on the digital space, or whether you are willing to deal with its consequences (i.e. ""guilty until proven innocent""). Since, in my interpretation, the consequences of the latter are not as severe as they are made out to be by some, I lean towards filters as the only viable solution to the problem at hand. There simply is no other way.

I see that the supporters tend to say that ""not introducing filters = not willing to fight copyright infringement at all"". This is misleading. Filters might not be effective, as I've said above, and raise concerns about limiting freedom of speech (in my opinion). There might be better and less invasive solutions.

I think we should fight **the cause** of copyright infringement, for example by making legal sources more accessible so piracy doesn't make sense anymore. How? Reduce geoblocking, create a service offering legal contents for a small price (like Spotify), offer a copyright system which is more beneficial for artists than for e.g. record labels (I've just proposed a more exact solution, but it's still very simplified though). Don't forget that giant rightholders might behave like giant corporations: maximise profits regardless of the costs.

&gt; It would be as if in our real world, criminals would be able to escape prosecution just by changing their clothes (making a new account).

This is how the Internet works: you can create many accounts as one person, you can freely change your IP address (e.g. via VPN or proxy), you can hide your identity with Tor etc.

This is the power of the Internet. To change that, you'd have to redesign it completely.

&gt; Under this hypothetical condition, do you really think ""innocent until proven guilty"" would be a thing, if society would instead have developed the ability for immediate policing?

It depends on the effectiveness of this ability.

&gt; We could even go a step further and say that ""guilty until proven innocent"" is already a thing in the real world, because suspects usually get taken in by police and put into jail before they are sentenced, after which their jailtime is either confirmed or they are let go. Isn't this exactly how content filters would work?

I'm not sure if this is **exactly** how content filters would work (e.g. arresting people and keeping them in jail until they are sentenced doesn't happen as often as uploading stuff to the Internet and doesn't apply to all suspicion types), but OK, the argument I used wasn't very good here.

&gt; (...) in this case I think the cost is smaller than the gain, in that for honest users, the worst-case scenario would be an inconvenience

An inconvenience which could be disastrous for parody channels on YT, large meme websites, review sites etc.

I don't think I'd consider my business viable if I had to obtain many, many licenses or my users and I had to deal with complaint paperwork every time they publish a parody, a meme, a review with a copyrighted content etc. (provided that many rightholders want their content to be filtered: I think it's very likely)

&gt; It's a bit like with the problem of racial profiling in police checks: it shouldn't happen, but when you can resolve this issue only by abolishing police checks entirely, the latter is even worse.

I don't think it's a good analogy as there might be solutions of the copyright infringement problem which don't use filters (see a few paragraphs above).

&gt; The internet should not remain lawless space and a parallel society. But of course, I accept this is a matter of opinion.

True, the Internet should not remain lawless space, but identifying copyright with the entire law, including points about hate speech, racial discrimination, terrorism etc. is simply wrong. Not enforcing copyright fully effectively is not equal to no law enforcement at all. Moreover, you cannot completely make the Internet not lawless space, because it's impossible with the way the Internet works (see ""This is how the Internet works...""). It's worth noting that this situation is beneficial e.g. for oppressed opposition in countries like China and Russia.

Why on earth not? Because it would prove that certain groups are far more likely to commit crime, not integrate, and may help us determine who we should allow into our countries?

&gt; Of the 67,500 people currently behind bars in France, it is estimated that 70 per cent are Muslim – when they comprise only eight per cent of the French public. It is illegal under France’s strict laicity laws to count the number of Muslim prisoners, but experts agree that the figure is an accurate average – with some prisons, like those near Paris and Marseille, seeing an even higher percentage.

He has been overwhelmingly elected years long before the immigration crisis, when the left-socialist / liberalist parties had a serious 30 minute speech leaked where they called the country a bitch, it's people idiots, and admitted to not do a single fucking thing in all their years in power, except using up and selling abroad everything they could including industry, land, etc. closed up dozens of schools, hospitals that could not operate due to their uncontrollable debt, made healthcare and university paid. Then came the world economy crisis, right in the middle of the Metro 4 case that is the biggest theft of money in Europe's recorded history, that the same left sided socialists committed as it was revealed now 10 years later. Orban was elected with the promise of kicking their ass out and restoring the country to a functioning one, with work based, fair society and and realistically shared burdens in taxing (so instead of more taxes on the people to solve the problem, they taxed the service providers and the industry, and made sure by law they cannot push their loss of profit to be paid by their consumers and workers), and now we have a healthy economy, steeply rising payouts, and still the kind of industry taxes that make the region attractive in contrast of other countries - there is a reason all the big car factories are being built here. Support of education and healthcare the socialists dare to cry for are on historical high, and family support too (which they socialists oppose every day and would have immigrants instead).

That's what Orban did. What you call fearmongering isn't why he is supported. Way, way before we had four hundred thousand barbarians march through our country, robbing old people and walking on highways like it's fucking natural.

The same people who did all that bullshit are the ones who cry dictatorship 24/7 in EU and support every idea that is about punishing their own country, then act shocked and say it's unfair nobody votes on them and how they have no chance to make change. Well yeah, democracy is still democracy, even if it didn't make them the winner. But that's not how they think, the leftist, socialist, liberaliest parties all act like there is only democracy if they win.

They had 8 years in a row and it resulted in the disasters above. A lot shit Hungary is under investigation for is coming to daylight these days but have been commited by them in their time, of course their media forgot to mentions this part, it only says ""Hungary is under investigation"" and leave it to the consumer to tie that to the current leadership in their thoughts.

2116,"This is going to pass in some form sooner or later.

Unfortunately, the only way for the idiots to understand how bad this is is if Google et al consistently play hardball and force the news publishers to suffer the economic consequences of the shitty laws they're lobbying for. Like they did in Spain and Germany. It's a sad day when I put more faith in a US company than in the EU.

What happened in Germany: the publishers lobbied for a law like this one and got it. Google said OK, we're removing your snippets, but gave them the option to opt-in to display snippets from their website if they agree to make the content available for free. Traffic is much lower for no-snippets links and the news sites quickly opt in. But then they sue Google for ""forcing them"" to give up on their copyright. Google says OK again, and removes the snippets again. But still that's not good enough. Apparently what they want is to force Google to display their content and pay them for it - it isn't OK for Google to *not use* their content.

Shit like this needs to be dealt with with an iron fist. The worst outcome would be if Google, Facebook, etc somehow found a compromise with the publishers.

Anyone who's ever had a website knows that showing up on Google is a good thing and beneficial for you, and how ridiculous these demands are. Google is helping you way more than you're helping them, it's basically free advertising.

2133,"&gt; yes I do have a problem with the word parasite. The word itself carries a significant negative connotation as you understand.

It still just has a biological definition—I don't give too many shits about all those ""connotation"" crap; that's just the deifnition of the world. From wiktionary ""An organism that lives on or in another organism, deriving benefit from living on or in that other organism, while not contributing towards that other organism sufficiently to cover the cost to that other organism. ""; a fetus meets that definition.

&gt; You now imply that you are an absolute rationalist and use the word under its raw definition. But this is likely not true given your stance marriage as a ""lending of the womb to a man"". Your previous comments imply a certain disdain to men and your final comment before I said anything impllies a disgust towards pregnancy as a process.

Well first of I never use the word ""man"" to speak of sex; the rare cases I use the word ""man"" is in the original unisex meaning. If I speak of sex I consistently use ""male"" so I didn't say that.

Second off it's a bit circular that you basically assume that my language was _not_ originally clinical to prove that it wasn't clinical.

What my comment simply put implies in its language is:

- Originally the only way for females to obtain income and livelihood was for a male to provide it to them in exchange for the services of their womb. Males needed females for exactly one thing: reproduction, otherwise they were essentially of little use.
- pregnancy involves another organism living inside of you that takes its toll on your body and ends with a rather painful event where the organism is ejected; all of that is not really a pleasant experience. 


In the end of the day I don't see how you can call pregnancy a pleasant experience; I just said that apart from that rather unpleasant experience and I did highlight its unpleasantness females had a relatively easy life devoid of actual labour; they were essentially provided for having to do little more than some mild cleaning and getting pregnant.",Dat is allemaal helemaal niet nodig hoor.,/r/europe/comments/8whym9/rising_proportion_of_single_person_households_in/e1vv0r1/,Homoerotic_Theocracy,1530875554

People vote for a goverment and if the goverment has the power to significantly restrict citizenship and chooses to do that for electoral reasons then that is the fault of the goverment.

One of the main points of the American constitution is to stop the tyranny of the mob that allows a goverment to abuse its power. I.e by mass removal of citizenship rights.

Regarding Trump, his criticism is totally invalid, because he discontinued the TTIP talks – a trade agreement which would have removed tariffs. What Trump wants are agreements that bring the US unfair  advantages.

&gt;Sunt de acord cu asta.

Hai, hai, nu tăia din comentariu fiindcă îți convine, bagă și restul:

&gt;&gt;**nu comunici sau trimți e-mail prietenului tău de budă, vorbești cu un** ***parlamentar***, **că e de acasă, că e în parlamentul european.**

Parlamentarul nu e prietenul tău de budă. Punct.

&gt;Atunci cum vrei să comunicăm cu un parlamentar (într-o situație ca aceasta de exemplu) dacă nu prin e-mail?

But what you're describing is not a philosophical ethical standpoint on intent but on consequences. For you the intent of the person (he wants to do good) is not relevant but the consequences (what he is doing it for is not good at all) are. I disagree as I find it rather odd to bind morality or heroism to the consequences as it completely neglects whether the person tried to act out of good intent. 

Because of this, both the German, British and Russian soldiers were heroes; despite all fighting for different consequences. The fact that a soldier jumps on a grenade to save his fellow comrades is a heroic act. It doesn't matter if he was fighting for Nazi Germany, Communist Soviet Union or Democratic United Kingdom. So if you see this soldier jump on the grenade to save his friends and continue fighting, would you not be able to decide whether that's heroic or not if you do not know if he was German, British or Russian? I would say you could decide whether that's heroic or not despite the fact of which country he was fighting for.

However, the ""most favored nation"" (MFN) clause(s) are *the* most fundamental principle of the WTO. MFN clauses were something that developed almost immediately when the first FTAs were negotiated hundreds of years ago, and they're seen as absolutely essential in any modern FTA.

2551,"No, it doesn't work. Germany and Spain have already tried. Germany's largest publishing house Axel Springer fought hard for it and supposedly won until they gave up after a few months with a free license for Google. Spain has passed a more comprehensive law that has completely discontinued Google News in Spain.

Translation from German Wikipedia:

&gt;Reactions to the introduction

&gt;Before the ancillary copyright law came into force on 1 August 2013, Google Germany contacted the press publishers in June 2013. They should inform Google whether they waive their rights under the law regarding Google News and grant it a free license. Otherwise their content would no longer be listed in Google News as of August 1; however, they would remain in the normal search. Google argued that six billion users worldwide click on the pages of media each month from Google News and that Google therefore represents real added value for publishers[51].

&gt;Shortly before the ancillary copyright law came into force, it became known on 30 July 2013 that many of the strongest supporters of the law, including publishers Axel Springer, Burda and FAZ, agreed to another free listing in Google News by accepting the ""opt-in"" requested by Google[52].

&gt;Not only Google implemented measures against ancillary copyright. Since the beginning of August 2014, the web portals GMX, Web.de and T-Online no longer display search results for content from Axel Springer and other publishing houses that have their ancillary copyrights represented by VG Media[53][54] Even less well-known search engines restrict their services as a precautionary measure or have since been completely discontinued due to ancillary copyrights. However, Google is the only search engine to own a free license from VG Media. This is regularly judged as distortion of competition and strengthening of the monopolistic situation of the German search engine market[55][56].

- Proposing the creation of a ""European Agency"" to regulate the big digital platforms to ensure the protection of personal data.

&gt;**However, the communique has been redrafted to remind Mrs May that the EU is prepared to make Britain a better exit offer if she softens some of the red lines** that have so far guided her Brexit strategy.

You said that people are wrong to think USA is harsh on illegal immigrants, because Europe is supposedly so harsh on illegal immigrants and instantly ""turns nazi"" when a small number of the arrive, less than what USA has. 

I pointed out that USA gets people who are culturally very different to what Europe gets and are therefore easier to intergrate, so there are differences between these situations.

You responded to this by talking about illegal immigrants and refugees in Turkey and Jordan, which is completely beside what we were talking about (also if you think illegal immigrants are treated well in Turkey, you should wonder why so many of them want to continue to the EU from Turkey). 

The numbers that Europe takes are not ""laughably small"".  Your ""15 million"" is probably an exaggeration (the actual number is maybe 
[11 million](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/27/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/)). Is 11 million illegal immigrants more than what Europe has? Probably. But is is overwhelmingly more than what Europe takes, justifying your smug attitude? Not by a long shot. 

Meanwhile, how many refugees has USA taken in? 3 million in total since 1980.

I'm the most radical anti-communist you can imagine, when it comes to actual property rights. IP is **not** legitimate property, though.

So yes, I'm against this directive because it's fundamentally wrong and immoral to create property titles on information.

Yea, oil isn't worth anything if you don't know how to use it. That's my point. They were sitting on it for thousands of years. Same with coal all around the world. Technology wasn't suddenly ""ready"", someone had to create these inventions and they were made in the west.

3040,"&gt; You've pointed out one mistake I have made 

I pointed out three mistakes you made. On hyperlinks, Article 5b and exceptions. I think that covered pretty much all of your initial points. 

&gt; The recent AMA didn't really help with this perception, either, as it aimed to only present one side of the story rather than, as I would have hoped, feature a debate between professional/experienced proponents and opponents other redditors could have followed. 

If we mean the same AMA that was not by activists, but by academics. If you don't trust even them, I don't know what to tell you. As for why there weren't proponents from both sides, well, tbh, it's kinda like Brexit and climate change: not very many academics support Art. 11 and 13. Indeed, numerous open letters signed by hundreds of them have been released calling for the deletion of both articles.  

&gt; as long as legitimate use of copyrighted content is not hampered -- meaning, as long as the relevant content, upon passing through the filter, is not actually blocked.

But that is not an option that is technically possible. Filters are not capable of identifying parodies - or for that matter 'short and proportionate' quotation given in the context of another work. So it's a moot point. 

&gt; Art. 5 of 2001/29/EC provides exceptions to copyright, and these continue to be respected for the application of Articles 11 and 13 of this Directive. 

Again: Art. 11 introduces a new *neighbouring* right, meaning that the exceptions of Art. 5 of the InfoSoc Directive *are not applicable to it*. Instead, the proposal explicitly suggests that Member States may adopt any of them as exceptions to the new right, but are not obliged to. If they want to they can introduce *no exceptions at all*. As for Art. 13, as already explained, it makes exceptions technically irrelevant. 

So no, in neither case, is it accurate to say that the exceptions will ""continue to be respected"". ""Continue"" is wrong for Art. 11 and ""respected"" is wrong for Art. 13.

&gt; excepting small and micro-businesses

There is no exception in the Voss proposal for small and micro-businesses.

Look, continuously correcting you is actually kinda fun, but I can't have a serious debate in half-digesed facts and constant misunderstandings, while also trying to stoke my interlocutor's ego. You clearly think you're too well-informed to learn from even the leading copyright professors in Europe - the people who literally write the textbook on these areas of law! - so I'm not sure there's any hope in me trying to change your mind. I urge you consider however that your resistance to those trying to fight for your rights is not the sign of sophistication you seem to think it is. Excessive suspicion is its own kind of naivite.

And you can't do that by saing she is retired for the same reason. Retirement age is regulated in the bill and 6 year term in the constitution.

Those would be preater legem action which goal is obviously to go around this 6 year term. Interpretation like this gives powers to the legislature and the executive that is not clearly stated in the constitution and for institutions what is not stated that is prohibited (for people it is the other way around).

If she fell sick or commited a crime that was recognised by the other judges, than I think it would be ok, because it would be proportional to the needs of justice system and done by the judges, therefore not infringing on the rule that judiciary is independent. But it still would be controversial.


To be frank there is no constitutional way to remove chief justice and I think that this is by design.

3097,"&gt;Well it depends on exactly what OP meant, but germany certainly doesn't have a good track record with either free expression nor internet privacy.

Not a good track record with free expression? Compared to Sweden maybe. Eg press freedom index ranks Germany highly, constitutional rights are very well protected.

As for the new, european copyright law, the German government opposes it, it's even in the governments coalition contract. It considers it illegal:

[http://copybuzz.com/copyright/germany-joins-eu-countries-considering-article-13-illegal/](http://copybuzz.com/copyright/germany-joins-eu-countries-considering-article-13-illegal/)

Doesn't mean there aren't problems and things to be worried about, like in just about any other country, our constitutional court has to give the government a good beatdown from time to time (which works quite well tbf), but ""Germany exposes it's true colors"" sounds like a bunch of crap in any context.

It sounds like some stupid movie were the protagonist has just joined the dark side.

&gt;So for example , I could say, and state my reasons for,  having gotten a masters degree in germany, I think the germany higher education system isn't very good.  Now we can debate about it, and thats fine, but because making such a statement obviously insults the dignity of: professors, administrators, students, etc  such a statement is illegal , and that should be concerning, that it is illegal to have a non violent opinion  .

And excuse my english here, but where the fuck did you get that crap from? That's not an insult, not realistically, and not legally. Criticising or insulting an institution isn't a legal insult in that regard.

An insult is of you call someone a piece of shit into their face. Or on social media.

Killed rebels are also a part of these 10,000. Ukrainian soldiers from these 10K had a very simple way to save their lives -- they had to just stay at home.

So if you blame these 10K only on Russia you are either an extreme hypocrite or extremely delusional. 

People in Donbass were displaced by war, not by Russia -- by the war started by Poroshenko. There are no millions of displaced in Russian Crimea, because there is no Ukraine and no war. Poroshenko knows very well what's going to happen if he'll try to attack Russia, so he can only bully Donbass rebels and bring death and destruction to Donbass.

Poland seems to be at around 74%

i dont like us being a net contributor, but i know its necessary for a stronger EU.
but if Poland does this, and it is fully within its right to do it.

i want the EU to ruin Poland.
tarrif all trade and even sanction them, have them pay their fair divorce bill as well, which will be even more than the UK if Poland remains once it is doesnt need funds anymore.
and i dont think reasonable Poles can blame me for thinking this way.

seriously, leaving after its your turn to pay for the poorer states would be the dickmove of the century.

the consequences of Poland doing such a thing would be horrific.
they would be shunned by the EU.
Russia would love to have Poland do such a thing.

and another thing im worried about.
as Polands economy is growing, more Poles will move back.
including new EU citizens, from poor and rich states.
Poland could turn its demographic to one similar to Germany.

with 100s of thousands of Italians, Spaniards, other EE and Scandinavians, from all over the EU.
and i dont think PiS voters will like that very much.
but thats the price Poland will have to pay to be in the EU, just like us.
they have to accept it, whether they like it or not.

this isnt the most tense relationship the EU has with Poland currently.
that day comes when Poland starts carrying more weight and pays more. and the goodies end.

and if Poland leaves the EU after its asked to pay instead of take.
thats when the EU knows Poland isnt to be trusted.

Since the earliest drafts its point was that the entire internet needed to be pre-emptively checked to prevent piracy. Even if the stupidly broad language in the current proposal, which would cover even code sharing, were tightened up, if the principle remains then it would create a system where every single site hosting user-generated content would need something like YouTube's Content ID. That means enormous costs, unsustainable for smaller and volunteer-run platforms, and troublesome even on larger ones because even Content ID, the most advanced of its kind, misses a lot and falsely flags as infringement a lot.

&gt; Europe’s migration crisis – sparked by Merkel’s government three years ago

A myth doesn't become a true fact by repeating it over and over again. The crisis started before Merkel acted, the refugees were in Europe in the 100,000s before Merkel lost a word on the issue. Germany and Merkel have *not* been the cause for the crisis, talks about ""sparked"" are just false in this context. 

&gt; The Italian Prime Minister talks about drawing up lists of Romany gypsies

He doesn't. That's Salvini, the minister of interior, not Conte. 

&gt; For the first time since the Second World War, Nazis sit in Germany’s Reichstag. 

The AfD are idiots, but they are no Nazis. 

&gt; In 2015, when the migration crisis began

It began years earlier. 2015 was the peak, not the start. 

&gt; Germany received 1.1 million asylum applications in 2015 alone.

Literally fake news. 890,000 was the number for 2015. 

&gt; had threatened to resign and bring down Merkel’s coalition if she did not agree a tougher immigration policy

Bullshit. The dispute wasn't simply a tougher immigration policy, the dispute was bi-/multilateral solutions vs. unilateral action. 

&gt; liberals 

Can we please not adopt the US definition of ""liberal""? Merkel isn't a ""liberal"". 

&gt; Albania, Eritrea, Nigeria, Pakistan and Vietnam

The application rates of albanians are irrelevant nowadays, Eritreans have proper reasons for asylum.

&gt; Three quarters of asylum seekers in Britain are men and the majority are in their early twenties. 

This is a lie. In none of the recent years, the share of men amongst asylum seekers to the UK reached 3/4. The ""majority in their early 20s"" claim is also factually inaccurate. The share of men between 18-34 is around 50%. ""Early 20s"" are much less than that. 

&gt;  but it will only succeed if migrants are barred from claiming asylum in Europe itself.

The main problem isn't the legal situation, the main problem is finding a country willing to house centers of this kind. None of the northern african countries has agreed so far, most have completely ruled it out.

European witches can be killed by pushing them into an oven, but Slavic witches can take out an entire army.

Moreover, the Slavic Elves are the inspiration for the Tolkien-Elves, and they are just the best fictional humanoid to me.

Sales went down as the UK increased tax on them. But people here are ridiculous. Spending £50K on a car and worrying about £100 per year increase. Diesels sales will come back as the polution gets sorted, as they're still the cheapest cars to run.
 

&gt;Actually, Electric cars have less parts and therefore needs less repairs and have a better expectancy.

Just Google Tesla reliability and have fun reading. It's similar to  BMW or other German car owners, too proud or too ashamed their super expensive car is unreliable, so public opinion and forums look like German is best, same shit happening to Tesla fanboys, but actual complaints and cases are common and horrific for a 100K product. Cars are built around batteries as well, and as long as that's happening, repairs will be complicated and costly. There is no DIY and limited amount of garages that know how to work with EVs, so maintenance and repairs are often expensive. 

 

&gt;Majority of the countries import oil from abroad as well. What is your point?

That going electric is a process that will take decades, if it's even successful as it's a layered problem not only connected to whether people ""like"" EVs. We don't (currently) have enough stable and constant power production in majority EU countries which would support a lot of EVs on roads.

 

&gt;The reality is that European manufacturers are 20 years behind on plug-in hybrids and electric. They are investing heavily into electric to hopefully catch up.

Behind who? 
 
Tesla hasn't yet broken even and is making loses each year. 
 

Toyota uses hybris which have higher consumption and cost more to buy, maintain and run than comparable diesels or turbo petrols.
 
Mazda decided EV is not the future but ICE
 
Hyundai is investing heavily in hydrogen cars even though they have their Ioniq, and now Kona.
 
Mitsubishi is going bust, sales are shit apart from their hybrid SUV and are joining Renault and Nissan partnership it seems.
 
Honda hasn't done anything significant since the first Insight electric car.
 
Subaru? 
 
Nissan has Leaf, apparently a good car, bit that's far from an EV revolution.
 
Or are we talking US manufacturers which is far worse than anything Asians are doing.

3478,"From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD#Objectives_and_activities

**Taxation**

The OECD publishes and updates a model tax convention that serves as a template for bilateral negotiations regarding tax coordination and cooperation. This model is accompanied by a set of commentaries that reflect OECD-level interpretation of the content of the model convention provisions. In general, this model allocates the primary right to tax to the country from which capital investment originates (i.e., the home, or resident country) rather than the country in which the investment is made (the host, or source country). As a result, it is most effective as between two countries with reciprocal investment flows (such as among the OECD member countries), but can be very unbalanced when one of the signatory countries is economically weaker than the other (such as between OECD and non-OECD pairings).  


**Publishing**

The OECD publishes books, reports, statistics, working papers and reference materials. All titles and databases published since 1998 can be accessed via OECD iLibrary.

The OECD Library &amp; Archives collection dates from 1947, including records from the Committee for European Economic Co-operation (CEEC) and the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), predecessors of today's OECD. External researchers can consult OECD publications and archival material on the OECD premises by appointment.  

**Books**

The OECD releases between 300 and 500 books each year. The publications are updated accordingly to the OECD iLibrary. Most books are published in English and French. The OECD flagship[vague] titles include:

*    The OECD Economic Outlook, published twice a year. It contains forecast and analysis of the economic situation of the OECD member countries.  
*    The Main Economic Indicators, published monthly. It contains a large selection of timely statistical indicators.  
*    The OECD Factbook, published yearly and available online, as an iPhone app and in print. The Factbook contains more than 100 economic, environmental and social indicators, each presented with a clear definition, tables and graphs. The Factbook mainly focuses on the statistics of its member countries and sometimes other major additional countries. It is freely accessible online and delivers all the data in Excel format via StatLinks.
*    The OECD Communications Outlook and the OECD Internet Economy Outlook (formerly the Information Technology Outlook), which rotate every year. They contain forecasts and analysis of the communications and information technology industries in OECD member countries and non-member economies.  
*    In 2007 the OECD published Human Capital: How what you know shapes your life, the first book in the OECD Insights series. This series uses OECD analysis and data to introduce important social and economic issues to non-specialist readers. Other books in the series cover sustainable development, international trade and international migration.  

**Magazine**

OECD Observer, an award-winning magazine[n 2] launched in 1962.[39] The magazine appeared six times a year until 2010, and became quarterly in 2011 with the introduction of the OECD Yearbook,[n 3] launched for the 50th anniversary of the organisation.[40] The online and mobile[41] editions are updated regularly. News, analysis, reviews, commentaries and data on global economic, social and environmental challenges. Contains listing of the latest OECD books, plus ordering information.[42] An OECD Observer Crossword was introduced in Q2 2013.[43]
Statistics

The OECD is known as a statistical agency, as it publishes comparable statistics on a wide number of subjects.

OECD statistics are available in several forms:

*    as interactive databases on iLibrary together with key comparative and country tables,  
*    as static files or dynamic database views on the OECD Statistics portal,  
*    as StatLinks (in most OECD books, there is a URL that links to the underlying data).  

**Working papers**

There are 15 working papers series published by the various directorates of the OECD Secretariat. They are available on iLibrary, as well as on many specialised portals.
Reference works

The OECD is responsible for the OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals, a continuously updated document that is a de facto standard (i.e., soft law).

It has published the OECD Environmental Outlook to 2030, which shows that tackling the key environmental problems we face today—including climate change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, and the health impacts of pollution—is both achievable and affordable.

Are you assuming that their servers should be configured to just throw away everything? If you trust some shitty algorithm to not throw away actually important messages, then you are not only an idiot but an asshole.

Representatives have a fucking duty to be available to the people they represent. Some of them don't care, but that's no reason to assume that that's true of everybody.

As someone who had to sift through &gt;20k of campaign mails some years ago without even being in any official position, let me just say that the only thing you accomplish by this kind of armchair activism is hindering those who actually care about their communications (and take the time to at least find any shred of original thought people added to the spam) from taking your concern to other representatives, because it takes fucking forever.

So good job.

&gt; You can't really get into contact with 20 MEPs by phone in order to argue about why this is concerning for you.

You can. Of course you ""can't"" if you can't even be bothered to take the ~30 minutes to write out your thoughts in your own words. And while it might take effort to actually reach your target person directly, that should not put you off. Also, you don't have to get in touch with 20, or even 5, because you're not the only sane person on this world trying to communicate with them.

Seriously, get in touch with people who share your views and start fucking organizing. You could form groups to make sure everyone of your target representatives and officials will get (and understand!) your points. You could, together, raise the money to send someone in person. Instead of thousands of nearly indistinguishable garbage, why not make an actually nice letter signed by thousands of people and get it to their office with some overblown hoo-ha?

If Nationalism is anyone's worldview, that person is quite limited in its view. What makes you think my worldview is nationalistic? Just because I dared to share some love for my ancestry and heritage? How incredibly ignorant of you to just assume my political content must end at nationalism and war. This is the closed mindedness I'm talking about. You people just lump anyone that doesnt hug Islam in the 'far right and dangerous' category, say some shit like 'I dont have time for people like you' and proceed to demonize them...  It has to end, you've got to take us serious, or at least bring some arguments and data to the table, don't just jump on your moral high horse and point down, whilst half the citizens of the nation are warning you.



Your reasoning about why people go to war is flawed I'd say. The Dutch have only gone to war outside of their nation out of necessity and defense, not all through a narcissistic love for ourselves. I'd give my life for freedom of speech, because I love that concept - not because I love my speeches. Lets see, which cultural denomination goes to war purely out of narcissism? I tihnk you know what I'm talking about...

I dont know where you live, but where I live, right now I can see 3 Turkish flags out my window, and the supermarket has an action going where u can sponsor the local Islamic school.

3665,"Well an US citizen looking at Europe has to know the location of 51 countries.
the easiest pick would be Russia,the boot(Italy), the UK and probably the jumping weasel(Norway,Sweeden and Finland).

An European looking at North America has like 33% chance of getting it right just by pointing randomly on the map since there are like 3 big countries and the rest are islands or smaller countries like Nicaragua or Guatemala.

But I agree that a better comparation would be with Africa.

I remember studying them intensely and knew 95% of their location when I was in school for some competition but I it all went down the sink.
Now I could probably get 4-6 countries right, Malawi being the only one thanks to that competition.

Operation SIZZLE called for dropping eight plutonium bombs in Mosow, seven on Leningrad, and 133 other atomic bombs on 70 cities. NATO literally had a plan that would murder hundreds of millions of Russian people, which would surely have led to the deaths of many more around the world. This was debated at the top levels of US/NATO leadership. By 1980, Russia was surrounded by NATO and US bases armed with nuclear missiles that targeted 40,000 sites. Regan placed Pershing II missiles in Germany.

NATO's history involves the aggression against Libya in 2011 which destroyed the country and ended up killing and displacing large numbers of people.

Wouldn't that rather be centralism, and federalism what you advocate for instead?

Federalism vs centralism is a complex issue, and as with all things, there are advantages and disadvantages to each so I think a balance should be sought. The fact that EU-wide laws can be passed can be empowering to citizens - see e.g. GDPR - but it can also be disadvantageous. In the latter case, I do find it more sensible to assign blame to the specific circumstances that facilitated it (i.e. the specific MEPs in this case) rather than the broader circumstances.

4033,"&gt; Again, you seem to not understand how HTTPS works

I do. But you don't understand how Cloudflare works. So you went on hypothesising from what I told you...

&gt; the owner needs to give them his certificate &amp; key.

...and hit the nail, although you didn't expect this one is really what happens. To back it up, a 5 seconds search turned [this](https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/keyless-ssl/) up. Citing: *« The standard Cloudflare SSL service requires a customer to share their site’s SSL key with Cloudflare. »*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; the website owner is selling your data to Cloudflare

Not really, it is using Cloudflare's DDoS service. Cloudflare claims to be good but it doesn't matter, they are in effect men in the middle for a vast amount of internet's traffic, with the ability to decrypt HTTPS. It doesn't matter what they are doing, just being in that position is a significant issue.

It is also not the same as `example.com` collecting data (which in itself is an issue that creeped up so much that it needed regulation able to both protect the development of data science *and* citizen's ownership and interests), because Cloudflare is able to follow users across sites due to its relevant service being so widely used. See previous post for that argument.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Don't trust stupid websites.

1. You can't know which ones use Cloudflare unless you're a very knowledgeable user, most likely working in a related field. For all intents and purposes, it *is* invisible.    
2. 30% of the web I need, sure. Maybe it's 15% for you and 45% for another dude, but we're talking about something extremely significant.    

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; But there's no workaround for that

No *technical* workaround. Law is the only recourse indeed in cases technically similar to Cloudflare's. For instance, force Cloudflare to *really* drop logs every week. If you think that's not realistic, Startpage does much better, for example. There are other regulating approaches.

4098,"&gt; I agree that hyperlinks alone are safe, but what about hyperlinks described with a title which is based on the article title and/or some fragments of the article? This would be a risky situation.

Well, since the title would be separate from the link it'd be an entirely different situation that has nothing to do with Article 11 to begin with. Someone critical of the Directive would rather point to Article 13 here, on the assumption that even a title would constitute copyrighted content that would be filtered.

Besides: ""The rights referred to in the first subparagraph shall not apply in respect of uses of **insubstantial parts** of a press publication. Member States shall be free to determine the insubstantial nature of parts of press publications taking into account whether these parts are the expression of the intellectual creation of their authors, or whether these parts are **individual words or very short excerpts**, or both criteria.""

That said: even for Article 13, for the definition of an ""online content sharing service provider"" under the Directive to apply, reddit would have to qualify for a role where ""as its main purpose, provide access to copyright protected content with the purpose of obtaining profit from this activity"". I think that's quite the stretch.

By the way, the Parliamentary amendment has inserted a new Article 5b titled ""User-generated content exception"" which ties directly into the application of Article 13:

""Member States shall provide for an exception or limitation to the rights provided for in Articles 2, 3 and 4 of Directive 2001/29/EC, point (a) of Article 5 and Article 7(1) of Directive 96/9/EC, point (a) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2009/24/EC and Article 13 of this Directive in order to allow for the digital use of quotations or extracts of works and other subject-matter comprised within user-generated content for **purposes such as criticism, review, entertainment, illustration, caricature, parody or pastiche** provided that the quotations or extracts [...] relate to works or other subject-matter that have already been lawfully made available to the public, are accompanied by the indication of the source, including the author's name, unless this turns out to be impossible, and are used in accordance with fair practice and in a manner that does not extend beyond the specific purpose for which they are being used.""

Remember: This Directive is an expansion of existing copyright to the digital space in quasi-automated format. Do you really believe that existing copyright allows rightholders to contact reddit to take down a thread based on its title?

&gt; Technically, who shows the excerpt? The platform or the user?

It's always the platform that shows everything, anyways, even if you just post a link alone. But you're right, the Parliamentary version actually added this clarification:

""The protection granted to press publications under this Directive should apply to **content automatically generated by an act of hyperlinking** related to a press publication without prejudice to the legitimate use of quotations.""

So unless this part gets removed during the trialogue (as the Council version does not have it) it may well be *intended* that platforms should either stop automatically pulling copyrighted content from links, or license the source. Unless .. the excerpt counts as a quotation, I suppose?

&gt; Moreover, the platform gets traffic and therefore earns more money from ads, thanks to the user content.

But is it the platform's main purpose and source of profit, or rather a side-effect of allowing users to upload/write anything?

And even that is just one of the requirements. Another is ""organising and promoting content in order to attract more audiences"", which is further defined as ""involving for example indexing the content, presenting it in a certain manner and categorising it, as well as using targeted promotion on it"".

&gt; However, even displaying these contents can be considered optimising (recital 37a)

Note it says ""promoting displaying"", not just ""displaying"". You may have read a comma into it?

&gt; If the created law is highly ambiguous, I think it's best to assume the worst-case scenario in terms of the possible effects.

The thing is, I don't think it's ""highly ambiguous"", not anymore at least. For all the criticism I see, I don't find it particularly difficult to point at some part in the Directive that, to my eyes, weakens those arguments, usually one of the Annexes used to convey the spirit of the law.

&gt; I don't see any problem in that as long as no misleading arguments are used

That's the tricky thing. I've seen so much hyperbole that is, again to my eyes, easy to dismantle that I've started to become quite cynical with this activist campaign. Of course, that may just be because there's so many people crying wolf that it gets harder for me to see the 10% that may have valid criticism among the 90% that are just exaggerating. This subjective impression is not helped by my posts, or those of a negotiator who jumped into the recent AMA to convey a counter-point, just being downvoted without most people even pointing out why. It makes me feel my posts just don't ""fit into their narrative"", so I suppose I may be starting to get a little paranoid.

On a side note, is copyright really censorship? Because that's ultimately what this comes down to. Not to mention that, if you're specifically concerned about news censorship, the Directive *also* includes various Annexes that would limit application to that regard. A brief scan of the documents gives me the following example from the newest Parliamentary version:

""Appropriate safeguards should however be put in place to ensure that measures applied do not infringe the fundamental rights of users, namely their right to protection of their personal data in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, Directive 2001/58/EC and Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and their **freedom to receive or impart information**, in particular the possibility to benefit from an exception or limitation to copyright.""

&gt; [This page](http://www.ccianet.org/about/members/) presents the members of the CCIA: there are many technological companies and Google is just one of them.

Admittedly, I'm inferring, but [Google is the biggest lobbyist of the tech industry](http://fortune.com/2018/01/24/google-facebook-amazon-apple-lobbying-efforts/). Since parts of its conglomerate are directly targeted by this Directive, I take this to mean they would use their membership in the CCIA to continue these practices.

Now, corporations lobbying must not necessarily mean their cause is bad, but ... well, whenever it comes to big corporations versus government, I tend to lean towards the latter by default, simply because it is far more likely that a megacorp will be interested only in its profits than a democratically elected government running some sort of conspiracy to oppress its populace.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8w0qvk/latest_text_of_eu_copyright_directive_shows_its/e1sr5dq/,akashisenpai,1530739372

&gt; I'm getting the feeling that you might not know exactly what https is, as in, at all

I'm getting the feeling that you might not know exactly how Cloudflare works, as in, at all. Cloudflare *needs* to decrypt HTTPS traffic in order to provide some of the DDoS protection features it advertises. Content is hosted under `https://www.example.com` and the request for it invisibly goes through Cloudflare, which with `example.com`'s permission and unknowingly to you (who don't even know Cloudflare is involved), decrypts the payload to provide particular features that cannot be provided without decrypting the content. Then it transmits the request to `example.com`, unencrypted (yay, here goes man-in-the-middle TLS stripping) or re-encrypted, depending on `example.com`'s configuration of the Cloudflare service, or it uses cached resources if applicable.

When the content comes back to you, Cloudflare has added a key/value pair to the response headers, so technically you *can* spot them as long as they bother adding such a tag, if you actively check for it; maybe using a home made add-on. But you can't access a great many websites if you are dropping further connections to sites that send back a Cloudflare header. So you will accept them, and Cloudflare will have, unknowingly to you, quite a detailed profile of your browsing habits up to the content of your HTTPS-encrypted activity on their clients' very numerous websites. There's nothing to be done, except blacklisting all those websites entirely. I evaluated what it would mean for me and some 30% of my traffic goes through this user-invisible Cloudflare DDoS service.",,/r/europe/comments/8vhvb4/gdpr_and_so_it_begins/e1sj6nv/,_Handsome_Jack,1530731301

4157,"The question would be just how much certain platforms depend on the sharing of copyrighted content. For YouTube, for example, the ability to find certain pieces of copyrighted music or even movies/shows may well be a significant contributor to its traffic.

That said, YouTube's existing filter - ContentID - would already suffice to cover the ""best efforts"" clause of the Directive (and is likely even what the document refers to when it mentions ""existing technology""), so I don't even foresee much of a change there. There's other sites that would be more at risk, but then again, perhaps they deserve to be, if they are transgressing this much against already existing copyright and are only allowed to continue operations because existing laws are insufficient to enforce said rights?

I would furthermore argue that the suggested ""best efforts"" would result in a filter that is, for content owners, better than what they have now (which is nothing but the right to send requests if they themselves notice a violation). For users, I doubt much would change, unless one's browsing habits depend a lot on consuming unlicensed works, simply because ""best efforts"" allows platforms to calibrate the filter in a way that it would, in doubt, decide *for* the user rather than the content owner, simply because it's the minimum effort of what they *have* to do.

In short, there is no incentive for them to calibrate a filter too stern (since they are not required, and it would harm their userbase); the only change is that now they have an incentive to filter *something* to demonstrate these ""best efforts"".

Is there still a degree of uncertainty? Of course; *any* law dealing with copyright will always have to be somewhat vague since it's impossible to cover all applications; this is when the courts would refer to the spirit of the law as outlined in the Annexes.

&gt; Then there is also the problem of affordability.

4173,"I have updated my comment many times since I published it for the first time, so I'm not sure if you've noticed all the changes.

&gt; Hyperlinks are specifically excluded from Article 11, so reddit is 100% safe.

I agree that hyperlinks alone are safe, but what about hyperlinks described with a title which is based on the article title and/or some fragments of the article? This would be a risky situation.

&gt; Things are a little more ambiguous for platforms like Facebook, where **posting a link results in the platform automatically posting a larger excerpt of the content**. However, I believe that even there, it should not be an issue, since the link itself was not gathered by the platform (like how aggregators work) but instead posted by the user, who acts in a non-commercial capacity.

This might be an issue because of what you've said in the part made bold. Technically, who shows the excerpt? The platform or the user? Moreover, the platform gets traffic and therefore earns more money from ads, thanks to the user content.

&gt; I agree that this is an uncertainty in regards to ""main purpose"", as it's very hard to nail down the threshold. This will very likely be something that will have to go before the courts to establish a precedence. However, the definition also includes a range of other factors, which to me make it seem very much tailored to ""aggregators"".

Article 13 says that it's applicable to providers sharing and optimising copyright protected contents. However, ~~even displaying these contents can be considered optimising~~ (my fault, the fragment below says ""promoting displaying"", not ""promoting and displaying"") the definition of optimising is quite broad (recital 37a):

""The definition of an online content sharing service provider under this Directive shall cover information society service providers one of the main purposes of which is to store and give access to the public or to stream copyright protected content uploaded / made available by its users and that optimise content, **including amongst others promoting displaying, tagging, curating, sequencing the uploaded works or other subject-matter**, irrespective of the means used therefor, and therefore act in an active way.""

&gt; I don't really foresee problems with other kinds of websites ... for now. Of course, I may well be biased in wanting to interpret the Directive positively, much like how others want to see problems with it (be it because they use a worst-case scenario as a safeguard, or just because they dislike such regulations in general).

If the created law is highly ambiguous, I think it's best to assume the worst-case scenario in terms of the possible effects. For example, when Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (PiS) (the ruling party in Poland) introduced changes to the Constitutional Tribunal, its politicians kept saying that they were repairing it, making it more apolitical and therefore better. However, almost everybody in my country can see today that the Tribunal doesn't work effectively at all and is fully dependent on the politicians.

I understand that a directive shouldn't be very precise, but when the new copyright directive can be interpreted in a way that threatens the Internet we know today, some serious action should be taken.

&gt; Just the campaign; I realize that by now at the latest, lots of ordinary users will have jumped onboard solely because (a) it's a catchy rallying cry, (b) it has a nice tool to voice protest, and (c) it's what everyone else who opposes it uses.

I don't see any problem in that as long as no misleading arguments are used (Internet censorship might be extensively carried out by giant rightholders in the long run if the directive in its current form comes into force, so I don't consider it a misleading argument. However, simple content moderation, e.g. to delete actual hate speech, is not censorship for me). Many people are not very technical and might not understand the possible implications of the directive very well, so catchy and accurate phrases are good for attracting these people. However, it's important to ensure that every opponent can defend their view without making themselves funny.

&gt; As for the funding, it's not intentionally hidden, just somewhat obscured under various layers. If you check their website, you'll note how it says they're funded by C4C, which in turn receives a large portion of its funding from the CCIA, of which Google is a leading member.

You're right that the CCIA is related to the campaign, but I can't find anything that could show that Google is a leading member. [This page](http://www.ccianet.org/about/members/) presents members of the CCIA: there are many technological companies and Google is just one of them. Moreover, I can't see anyone related to Google in [the board of directors of the CCIA](http://www.ccianet.org/about/board-of-directors/). Perhaps I'm not looking closely enough, but I'm doubtful at the moment.

&gt; I also agree that Google being involved in any way is not necessarily negative, but it is one factor to consider when looking at how truthful opponents of the Directive actually present themselves, and I keep seeing elements of misrepresentation or scaremongering, such as with the article discussed in this thread.

You're mostly right: I can't understand why many people keep referring to incorrect arguments against the directive, even though the danger related to it is serious in my opinion. However, it's wrong to assume that **every** opponent is mainly influenced by Google or other big technological companies. It is the accuracy of arguments used by both sides that matters, not the sponsors of the sides, if applicable of course.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/8w0qvk/latest_text_of_eu_copyright_directive_shows_its/e1sjpfo/,super_max2,1530731831

4204,"&gt; i never said so, I know my own history.

I never said you said so, I was referring to the quote you posted.


&gt; There actually are very real reasons as to why this wave is different from the others.


I guess time will tell if you're right or not. My view is that integration is primarily linked to the economic state of the country. When a country has enough prosperity, integration can happen more smoothly.


&gt; This is completely false (and insulting). Separation of Church and state has only been a thing for 100 years, France has over 1500 years of history. Also are you saying that someone who was an anti-republican like Charles Maurras was not french?


I'm talking about adhering to the CURRENT constitution which defines what it means to be French in today's society, obviously that means something different from what it did hundreds of years ago. Just like ""French culture"", the French constitution is not a stable fixed thing, it has evolved &amp; been rewritten a lot throughout history. 


&gt; What makes a person truelly french is the fact that they are culturally french. We are not the USA, only bound together by a common vision, we are an actual nation with history, culture, traditions.


Yes, but that history &amp; culture isn't a stable or unified thing. It's constantly evolving &amp; being influenced by what's happening to &amp; around France. Our nation is a patchwork of many different regions &amp; islands, some of which have belonged to other countries or empires for longer than they've ever been ""French"". For example, Nice has only been part of France since 1860 &amp; a local living in the mountains there probably has more common culture &amp; history with an Italian from Piedmont than with a Parisian. So tell me, which culture &amp; what traditions make one ""truly French""?


&gt; France is not a multicultural country, unless you are talking about native culture like alsatian, provençale, etc, and even then.


That is what I'm talking about. It's true that multiculturalism has never been a French ideal, but I'd argue that the country is multicultural according to a basic definition of the word: ""relating to or made up of several different cultures"" https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/multicultural

Sure, reforms would be nice, but the current government doesn't reform the judiciary, they just destroy it by nominating their own judges to make sure they'll be protected from prosecution. All we've got from the changes to the judiciary made since 2015 is the slowing down of the Constitutional Court, nominating a judge who had disciplinary action taken against him to a high position, and the prosecution trying to force a guy driving a $1000 car to take the blame for the crash of a improperly marked government convoy.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/8vwhma/thousands_of_people_are_protesting_in_poland/e1sbsbs/,Oh_ffs_seriously,1530724146

When did you British invent a word to cover your asses whenever someone exposes you for your hypocrisy and imperialistic chauvinism? I want one too!

Besides, why is it you can talk about Russia's past, but no one can talk about yours? Don't think we all see the strategy behind your deployment of such a hypocritical word

Fact is that Russia has different targets than us, and it doesn't need to abide by any agreement with the EU. There seems to be little repercussions we can enact on them when they don't follow the rules.

Isn't that what people want? For immigrants to integrate? Every racist ever complains about how immigrants don't integrate, and then people like you come along saying they shouldn't be allowed to integrate. 

So what you're just going to start kicking out every non-white European that was born here? You're going to wish they don't integrate so that you can continue bitching about how they aren't integrated?

Also why is it so important for you that only white Europeans with European heritage should live on this continent? 

Why can't ""indigenous"" Europeans preserve themselves just because people of other color are also living besides them? You can go fuck a white girl and preserve your European heritage all you want, so what's the problem? Does it simply bother you to see that people from other cultures are also present on the continent?

Not to mention that your whole notion of ""indigenous"" Europeans and native culture is severely naive. European culture IS a product of many years of migration and integration of many aspects of what was at the time ""foreign culture"".

4350,"&gt;People raised the exact same issues you do now about every past migration.

I actually believed this before but not anymore. There actually are very real reasons as to why this wave is different from the others.

* 1) Religious/cultural proximity, this one is obvious.
* 2) Resentment for historical conflicts between France and the muslim world, once again, obvious.
* 3) Muslim immigration is massive and never ending. Between 1870 and 1930 3.5 millions italians came to France and only 1.1 millions remained. Nowadays we have probably over 6 millions muslims, more come every years and they never go back home.
* 4) At the time of the previous waves of immigration, immigrants legally had to have give french names to their kids, there was no welfare state to rely on if they were unemployed, there was no family reunification, the judicial justice system was much more harsh. This is why so many italians returned to Italy, because they literally had to assimilate or leave (most of them left, because assimilating is very difficult even for members of a culture as close to ours as the italian one)
* 5) Recent immigrants are raised in a culture of excuses : ""You are suffering from racism"", ""France is evil, it colonised/enslaved your ancestors"", ""you deserve hands out as reparation for colonisation/slavery"", ""do not assimilate, french people are decadent"", etc. How can they assimilate when they are raised from birth to hate France, its culture, history and values?
* 6) Muslim immigrants have taken over entire neighborhoods and driven out the native/assimilated french who lived here before. If you do not believe me, read : ""Les Territoires perdus de la République"" from Georges Bensoussan. How can immigrants assimilate into a culture that is absent from where they live?

&gt;The thing that truly makes a person French regardless of culture is their absolute respect of the French Constitution, which means, among other things, respecting the separation of Church &amp; State.

This is completely false (and insulting). Separation of Church and state has only been a thing for 100 years, France has over 1500 years of history. Also are you saying that someone who was an anti-republican like Charles Maurras was not french? This would be absurd. What makes a person truelly french is the fact that they are culturally french. We are not the USA, only bound together by a common vision, we are an actual nation with history, culture, traditions.

&gt;It's this principle of ""Laïcité"" that truly differentiates France from other ""multicultural"" countries

France is not a multicultural country, unless you are talking about native culture like alsatian, provençale, etc, and even then.

&gt; Society will naturally absorbe some new cultural elements &amp; reject others.

And unless muslim immigrants drastically reinterpret Islam (and sadly, they wont) we will reject it. 1300 years of history proves it, France is incompatible with Islam.

NB : Obviously not all muslim, you understood me.

Article 11 will cover commercial use (such as on Facebook) of snippets/thumbnails of news stories.  Not mere links, but the kind of ""card"" that we are so used to these days.  Publishers, I predict, will instantly cave in and give Google and Facebook free licenses.  This is what has happened in individual European countries in the past with Google News for example.  Why will they do that?  They need the traffic.  


But smaller providers - dead.  They don't have the clout to get permission to use a snippet or thumbnail, and they can't afford to pay.  So goodbye competition.  ""Private and non-commercial use"" is protected - so you can still privately email a snippet of a news story to your cousin.  But another private and non-commercial use - a screenshot sent to your friends on Instagram or Tumblr or Reddit is \*commercial\* use because of the entity.  Remember, an explicit and stated goal of the content industry is a removal of ""safe harbors"" - which means forcing platforms to stop YOU from doing the things that you normally and naturally have every right to do.  


We should also step back and think about this beyond just a pure industrial dispute between big corporations.  Copyright is important for the promotion of culture and intellectual work.

Different interpretation on God's word.

Lets take your slavery example.

Yes slavery was left legal in Qur'an because it was legal at the time it was given to people by God. 

BUT there are so many passages that advise you to ""free a slave"" in exchange for a obligation that you miss to fulfill or cant fulfill due to whatever reason. so if you are a thinking man, you will understand that ""slavery"" is not to be continued (intention of Qur'an/Islam/God) into infinity but rather to be eradicated over the time.

Also when you say slavery - in your head you have a picture of black man picking cotton and being beaten every day by its owner -while in Quran - while slave is still being slave there were rights of slaves that were clearly defined - another example of intention to eradicate slavery over the time and give to those people more rights than they used to have prior.

As an example: I'm LDS. When I married my wife I did so in a civil ceremony. After that ceremony I also went through a religious ceremony where we were ""sealed"" to each other. That last part carries absolutely no legal significance outside of my religion. 

If I were to (God forbid) divorce my wife I would need to go to civil authorities to get the legal marriage divorced. However to get the religious part dissolved I need to turn to my church. Of course in this case there is no court. Instead I just write a letter and explain the situation and then the appropriate ecclesiastical authority considers it and decides whether to dissolve the marriage or not. Usually they do it with no fuss. But even if they don't, I would still be divorced in the eyes of the state and the church would not try to stop me from dating or even remarrying.

im usually used to dickheads on this sub.
so ill explain my position.

perhaps the usage of the word dehumanizing isnt apt in this context.
i should have worded it differently.
so, ill try something else.

the people that i tend to know that dont view migrants or the children of migrants as fellow countrymen, or wont even extend the courtesy as referring to them as ""french'' are racists. period.

they'll use words like beasts, animals, invaders or an infection.
they used to pick on EE.
and used those same labels on them, still do actually, but not as much anymore.
but now, they found their new punchingbag.

and now because of the refugee crisis, they pick on Muslims or Arabs and generalize.
there is nothing wrong with targeting the bad apples, and if we can kick them out, we should.
the problem is when we generalize about all Europeans with Arab backgrounds.
because the ones that are innocent will feel unwelcome in the country they were born, just because of the colour of their skin.

now, there is nothing wrong with not wanting immigration, or less immigration.

not viewing them as French or German or anything else excludes them and labels them as outsiders that will never fit in.

now, some might view that as dehumanizing.
and listening to the rhetoric of Wilders for example.
you would think it is dehumanizing.
or take Trump for example.

or his supporters, they view Mexicans as less than human by using the exact same rhetoric European right wingers use, words such as invaders, parasites or an infection.

i dont want anyone, of any background to be treated as such.
we shouldnt allow it to happen to anyone just because we arent the ones targeted.
WWII and the Balkan war taught us that.
because it is a slippery slope.
and this always happens, this isnt the first time, Germans did it to Spanish and Italian workers back in the 60's
the Americans did it to the Irish and Italians back in the early 1900's.

Apparently it isn't because this graph here does not say ""includes both rich and poor people"" now does it? It just says ""includes both sexes""

&gt; My point was that no matter what the statics are about they note what it is about. In this case it is life expectancy at birth including both sexes.

Yeah, they are also:

- life expectancy at birth: both rich and poor people
- life expectancy at birth: all races
- life expectancy at birth: all hair colours

In fact it makes you wonder how many of the commandments in all those books aren't just given to males; remember that females at the time that those books were written were essentially not even criminally culpable and were basically considered minors; there was always some male who was responsible for their actions and vested in their decisions be it their parent or spouse.",Dat is allemaal helemaal niet nodig hoor.,/r/europe/comments/8w01c3/the_uks_first_female_sharia_judge_i_am/e1rtni3/,Homoerotic_Theocracy,1530703062

4571,"How much do you know about quantum information/qubits?  

Here the Majorana's aren't fermions actually, but are bound states, which are non-abelian anyons, they are no longer fermions.  
You can use these as qubits in a [topological quantum computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer). 6 of them (3 pairs) form a 2 qubit system.  The first 3 majorana's form the first qubit. And braiding them are qubit operations/gates.  
Braiding the first two once is a half phase flip (quarter rotation around Z axis), so doing it twice is a full phase flip; a Z gate. As perfectively executed by group E this world cup.    
Z(a|0&gt; + b|1&gt;) = a|0&gt; - b|1&gt;  
Braiding the second and third once is half a bit flip. (And thus twice is an X gate)  
X(a|0&gt; + b|1&gt;) = b|0&gt; + a|1&gt;  

Braiding the third and fourth brings you in the realm of two qubit operations.

It doesn't matter one bit what the state of things actually is, it matters how the average voter _feels_ they are. Elections by and large in the West (not just Poland, the same is happening here and elsewhere) are decided on an almost purely emotional basis now.

Democracies require an informed voterbase to function as intended. When a huge chunk of the voters do not care to think or think to care about anything and a lot of the rest don't vote at all, well, (wannabe) despots and idiots is the norm. The same is true here: mainly older people vote, and they have have been voting right-leaning coalitions to power for over a decade now, and then they wonder when wages are slashed, education funding is cut and benefits are cut and not much is actually being done to help the unemployed/the poor. Young people look at this and say: 'see it makes no difference who you vote, they'll do the same shit anyway', and abstain from voting as a lazy moronic protest that only helps keep the cycle going.

Then of course RSA and APL are not the only reasons for french's hight unemployment rate of course, there are many other reason like how protective for the worker our labor code is (Macron is trying to change this atm), we have two major employment contract, and the most popular of these 2 (CDI) is basically forbids the company to fire peoples (by forbids I mean it's gonna be very expensive). The over one (CDD) is very impopular amongst workers (but it's more and more used cause companies wants to be able to fire employees) and is less protective: u hire someone for a period of time, and at the end of this period, he's no longer u're employee, but again, u can't fire him at the middle of his contract...

For those and many other reasons I guess, if u look at France since the end of the Trente Glorieuses, we had this problem with very hight unemployment rate. [Relatable Graph where u can see we're around 10% of unemployment since around 1985:](http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/taux-de-chomage-1967-2005/414239-3-fre-FR/Taux-de-chomage-1967-2005_large_carte.jpg)

Actually many people in France think it's good because they value the welfare state (cause we need to protect the poor right), and more and more people are starting to argue about that (cause it's better for a human being's ego to say ""I earned that money"" than just being ""gifted"" it). 

So yup there's quite a debate in France if we actually should go the Anglo-saxon's way or stay in this system but the point is, both are sustainable, it's more like an ideologic debate at this point. Well of course there's also the fact that we're in the common market so now French companies are competing against companies of the Anglo-saxons system (Germany included), and we can't be in one big economic zone without having the same way of working/the same rules so we're sligthly walking toward the Anglo-Saxon system (Well of course we're all gonna be fucked by the Irish system at the end, but that's another story...)

Let's say I am interested in seeing what actually made other people take up their positions and, unless I have to concede, see if I can change their mind or at least find some common ground. It's better than the polarization that is dominating debates such as these nowadays.

As for your post, I am convinced that the current ""clusterfuck"" is merely the results of slow bureaucracy and lack of efficiency. The existing processes are already set up nicely, they just lack the personnel and funding to process both applications as well as deportation in a speedy manner, which is bad for the immigrants (those deserving to stay, at least) and bad for the host countries. Correcting *these* mistakes rather than knee-jerk ""close the borders!"" seems like a more sensible approach, as a hardline stance ultimately means that we'll have to give up on humanitarian commitments in the European Charter of Universal Rights without even a real need to do so, which would not only set a dangerous precedent but also be a sad thing considering the idealistic nature of the whole European project.

It's also worth pointing out that ""blackmailing and threatening"" refers to pointing towards existing treaty agreements such as the first unanimously agreed-upon relocation package -- a certain expectation to stick to previously agreed-upon measures, which personally I don't consider asking too much?

Ultimately, ""lack of unity"" within the EU comes from populists suddenly backpedaling on promises once cooperation turns into participating rather than just benefiting. There's no good reason to leave the border nations alone with the burden just because of their geographical location, so why are people against quotas?

Poland Purges Supreme Court, and Protesters Take to Streets

WARSAW — Poland’s government carried out a sweeping purge of the Supreme Court on Tuesday night, eroding the judiciary’s independence, escalating a confrontation with the European Union over the rule of law and further dividing this nation. Tens of thousands took to the streets in protest.

Poland was once a beacon for countries struggling to escape the yoke of the Soviet Union and embrace Western democracy. But it is now in league with neighboring nations, like Hungary, whose leaders have turned to authoritarian means to tighten their grip on power, presenting a grave challenge to a European Union already grappling with nationalist, populist and anti-immigrant movements.

The forced retirements of up to 27 of 72 Supreme Court justices, including the top judge, and the creation of a judicial disciplinary chamber were the latest in a series of steps by Poland’s right-wing Law and Justice Party to take over the justice system.

For years, the party has demonized judges as unreconstructed Communists and obstructionists. After coming to power in 2015, it took control of the Constitutional Tribunal, which is tasked with ensuring that laws do not violate the Constitution, and gave authority over the country’s prosecutors to the Ministry of Justice. Most recently, it asserted new powers to select judges. In recent days, judges who have spoken out against the changes have reported being harassed and intimidated.

Each move has been greeted with international condemnation and angry demonstrations.

Hours before the purge took effect at midnight, Poles again took to the streets in more than 60 cities and towns around the country. As the sun set in Warsaw, crowds gathered in front of a memorial dedicated to those who died in the city’s 1944 uprising against Nazi Germany, chanting an old but familiar refrain: “Solidarnosc.”

But now, calls for solidarity were not directed at an occupying force — or at Communist rule, which the labor-backed Solidarity movement brought down in 1989 — but at a democratically elected government, albeit one the demonstrators fear is undermining the system they fought so hard to build.

“We are here because of the destruction of the judiciary in Poland,” said Kamila Wrzesinska, who stood amid a sea of Polish and European Union flags. Organizers passed out placards with one word: “Constitution.”

In an interview just days ago, the leader of the Supreme Court, Malgorzata Gersdorf, expressed deep concern about her country’s direction.

“I don’t want to say that I am terrified,” she said, “but without a doubt this is not a direction I would like to go in, nor support, as I think it destroys what has been built over the last 25 years.”

The new law passed by Parliament requires that judges retire when they turn 65 unless they appeal to the country’s president, Andrzej Duda, who has sole discretion over whether they can remain.

Justice Gersdorf, who is 65, and more than a dozen others have refused to make such appeals, saying that the law itself was unconstitutional. Their supporters say the law was aimed at certain judges and had little to do with age, an argument that was bolstered when the government named Justice Gersdorf’s replacement: the 66-year-old judge Jozef Iwulski.

The ousted justices vowed to show up for work Wednesday morning, setting the stage for a possible confrontation with the authorities.

Officials with the governing party say they are simply overhauling a corrupt system that obstructs popular will. But critics, both in Poland and abroad, contend they are building one in which the courts are subservient to politicians.

In his zeal to create what he calls a Fourth Republic, free of any vestige of Communist rule and vest the state with ever greater power, the party’s leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, has also set the nation on a collision course with the European Union. The bloc views the changes as a threat to the rule of law and the Western values at the heart of the treaty binding the union of nations.

But the European Union’s failure to curb Hungary’s drift toward authoritarianism has emboldened other leaders in the region, where right-wing nationalism and populism are on the rise. Right-wing governments have taken power recently in Austria and Italy, while Chancellor Angela Merkel, a guardian of liberal Western values, just agreed to build camps on Germany’s borders to process migrants.

If Poland is not made to pay a high price for its actions, critics and outside legal experts worry, currents unraveling democracy in member states will be further strengthened.

It is far from clear how much more the European Union can do. For the first time in its history, it has turned to the so-called nuclear option, invoking Article 7 of its founding treaty. Poland could lose its voting rights as part of that process, although that would require a unanimous vote by the 28 member nations — a highly unlikely result, considering its strong backing from other countries that have moved in an authoritarian direction.

European officials also announced on Monday that a so-called infringement procedure had been started against Poland, which could result in the matter being referred to the European Court of Justice. The court could declare the judicial overhaul unconstitutional, but it cannot stop it.

For now, many of the country’s 10,000 judges remain united in their opposition to the government’s measures. And counter-pressures are building in Poland’s vibrant civil society.

Lech Walesa, who led the Solidarity movement that ended Communist rule in Poland and then served as president from 1990 to 1995, vowed on Sunday to lead a campaign of civil disobedience if Justice Gersdorf and other judges were removed.

“I am saying a definite ‘enough’ to this,” he wrote on Facebook. “If they raise their paws against the Supreme Court, then I am going to Warsaw.”

Judges who have spoken out publicly against the purge have reported being threatened, harassed and intimidated.

Waldemar Zurek, a former spokesman for the National Council of the Judiciary and a district court judge in the city of Krakow, has been openly critical of the changes. In response, he says, both he and his family have been subject to intense pressure and abuse, including death threats.

Judge Zurek said he was dismissed as a spokesman for the courts, threatened with disciplinary sanctions over fabricated allegations, and harassed by government agents, including at his home. His financial records were improperly disclosed, he has faced what he calls a trumped-up investigations about a long-ago real-estate transaction, and he has gotten scores of threatening emails and letters.

“All those who stand in the way of the minister become public enemies,” he said. “They are spat on.”

Justice Gersdorf, whose title is first president of the Supreme Court, said she thought that the mandatory retirement age was set with her in mind. Backed by 63 other judges on the court, who voted last week that she should stay in office, Justice Gersdorf said that she would continue to show up for work.

“I have no intention of resigning, since my term of office is six years,” she said.

Such defiance is the latest and most high-profile development in a confrontation that has been building for months.

In December, the Venice Commission, which is responsible for monitoring rule of law for the European Union, expressed “grave concerns” that the judicial overhaul put “at serious risk the independence of all parts of the Polish judiciary.”

Poland was given until the end of June to make changes that would satisfy those concerns. But no agreement was reached in meetings last week in Luxembourg, and Polish leaders vowed to press ahead.

“In essence, this is the end,” Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Thursday after meeting with European leaders. “We do not intend to withdraw from this reform.”

Mr. Kaczynski, the governing party’s leader, has not hidden his intentions.

“In a democracy, the sovereign is the people, their representative in Parliament and, in the Polish case, the elected president,” he said in a 2016 speech. “If we are to have a democratic state of law, no state authority, including the Constitutional Tribunal, can disregard legislation.”

Lacking the two-thirds majority needed in Parliament to change the Constitution, the party instead took control of the tribunal. After that, the tribunal approved laws, like those restructuring the courts, that critics have called unconstitutional.

The party then gave the Minister of Justice the role of prosecutor general, which had previously been independent, and it took over the National Council of the Judiciary, which is responsible for appointing judges.

Parliament also created a new disciplinary chamber that the opposition says would be used to attack judges who displeased the party.

“Judges in this disciplinary chamber will be earning 40 percent more than the justices on the Supreme Court,” Justice Gersdorf said. “It has to be emphasized that this is political bribery.”

One of Poland’s great accomplishments after 1989 was restoring public faith in the courts, she said, but it “will require years of rebuilding” to undo the damage being done to that achievement.

She shrugged off concerns that she might have to pay a high price for her defiance.

“They are not putting people in jail yet,” she said.

4806,"&gt; Total bullshit, the current gov shat on all the democratic institutions we have (had) and remade all of them as their little puppets. The president and the gov brake the law and the constitution almost every time they introduce new laws.

Source? Also, I'm a firm believer that one political party has to have majority in all government branches, in order for the country to grow. If multiple parties control various parts of the government, checks and balances will just promote obstructionism.

&gt; The gov owns all the national media and they're spreading their state-propaganda every so day don't act like the gov is oppressed by journalists

The government 'owns' all *national* media. Take a second to re-think what you just wrote there. National media is... well, it's funded by the government, so... yes, in a way, they 'own' them. There are plenty of private news agencies around too. 

&gt; Any data to prove it? Or do you only mean the ""true Poles""?

Yes, the fact that the current president &amp; party are elected should be enough.

&gt; That's just false, there are currently no judges who passed this kind of judgments in the communist times, that's the propaganda I was talking about

I can't even find the full list of names of the 27 judges that are due to retire with this new law. Granted, Małgorzata Gersdorf seemed opposed to communism in her political history and I can't find anything else stating otherwise. However, this is just at a glance as of 1980. 

&gt; How can you complain about somebody's alleged communist past when the guy who worked on this new law actually was a documented communist PZPR's prosecutor who was himself active in repressing opposition to the Communist government in the 1980s - Stanisław Piotrowicz

I agree, it's clear he was part of the communist party in Poland, however, he's not a judge but a legislator. He was also voted in to being part of the Sejm in 2011 and then re-elected in 2015, so his position was acquired 'fairly'. 

The law in question specifically targets control of judges, and it was passed in a democratic way via legislature from politicians that were voted in by the people. If the people really don't like it, they can vote again come next year to opposition.

Lastly, the legislature set into place does not violate the Polish constitution, in my opinion. Feel free to read up on it yourself:

http://www.cossw.pl/file/redir.php?id=5603

Akt #180

1) They aren't being removed, the law put in place is setting a retirement age that all judges have to follow

2) Again, they aren't being forcibly removed, but in accordance to the new law of retirement and term limitations

3) This is where the constitution specifies that the judge can be retired as a result of illness, or loss of strength. Loss of strength is clearly a very broad definition. Loss of physical strength? Loss of mental strength? Is an age (65) enough to justify the argument that a judge is experiencing a 'loss of strength'? An appeal was made available to all judges who want to contest their retirement.

Sure. That doesn't mean that Russia is ""honest"" about being corrupt. Putin and his friends constantly deny that anything weird is going on when they jail or kill the opposition. They even denied having soldiers in Ukraine. They deny meddling in the US election. They deny everything.

&gt;In the West, there is the ""oh no, we're so democratic, no surveillance, bla"" veil that many still do believe.

The west is vastly more democratic than Russia. But we know that we have surveillance. European countries don't invade and threaten our neighbors though, we don't kill or jail our opposition. The EU isn't perfect, but it's a completely different ballpark to Russia. What a weird comparison to make.

4957,"&gt;And that's not all that JURI did. It also outlawed image search with an amendment. No joke. 

I think that it's not trying to outlaw it.  It's just saying that image indexers would need to buy a license from the publishers associations.  Which might kill off a number of services, but even if one had to pay to use Google Images in the EU to provide the funds for GEMA and friends, I'd assume that the idea is that it can operate.

I think that they screwed up, though.

The problem is that one might at least imagine a world in which one could do this for news sites, for Google News.  The news agencies are theoretically tracking their own use of copyrighted images, and Google News is whitelisting a small number of news services.

But Google Images and similar sites hits all websites (other than those blocking it with `robots.txt`), everywhere.  There's no way for an image indexer to know who owns copyright on a given image.  No organization can extend a blanket license to all images on the Internet.  So it's a good bet that they aren't gonna index.

So I assume that tineye.com ([and similar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_image_search)), archive.org, Google Images and so forth cut off access to users in the EU.  Commercial stock image sites, like shutterstock.com, should remain viable.

It isn't a ""kill the Internet in the EU"" move, but it does seem to render unavailable a substantial class of services that I'd consider both valuable and unlikely to be actually cutting into the value of the copyright holder's property.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8vwdq5/apparently_the_eu_copyright_directive_will_outlaw/e1rct9p/,vokegaf,1530675812

It genuinely seems like you believe in a sort of Dutch Volksgeist, which is immediately suspicious in this circumstance, and in which you write elsewhere that the Dutch should perhaps become chauvenistic and nationalist.

There's some interesting scholarship about the governing ideology of North Korea. *The Cleanest Race* by Myers makes an analysis of DPRK propaganda and concludes that it is essentially an adaptation of Japanese fascism that redefines Korean ethnic nationalism. One of the narratives the author analyses is the narrative of the Korean as the innocent and morally righteous subject who is exploited by aggressive and exploitative foreigners. When you write things like ''we don't recognize [our culture] enough - and its content is too humble - to overpower such an aggressive culture as the Islamic one, one that explicitly revolves around recognizing itself.', I am reminded of this.

Oh yeah, and quit your atrocity apologism. The idea that the Dutch treated their colonial subjects like themselves is patently false. Jesus, the Dutch utilised massacres as colonial policy. A terrifying example is the Banda Islands, where the Dutch eradicated the majority of the islanders to run them off their lands, and off of cliffs, terrorising them with public brutality to ensure they did not come back, then resettle the territory with plantations worked by slaves, often enslaved from their other conquests. The idea that slaves were not profitable to them, when they were central to their spice trade, is absurd - and they are in themselves a clear example that the Dutch treated others unlike how they treated themselves.",Planetary Union,/r/europe/comments/8vrnao/dutch_culture/e1r4r9s/,ingenvector,1530666871

And these are white-collar salaried employees at the Seattle office. After reading the article, I was really mad and cancelled my prime membership.

2022 England defend their WC title. Economic growth now in the double digits

2023 After Greece and Italy leave the EU, the entire bloc unravels within months. Angela Merkel is found dead in her office, having taken her own life.

2024 England defend their Euro title. Economic growth persists. Due to overwhelming popular support, Theresa May is crowned Queen for her impeccable leadership that has lead to a new British golden age, taking the name Theresa I. The Windsor family is exiled to France. Parliament is dissolved.

2025 After two defaults in as many years, the economically devastated United States beg the UK to re-establish their status as a British colony.

2026 England defend their WC title again, beating, amongst others, a German team wearing jerseys from the previous tournament due to lack of funds for new equipment.

2027 Theresa I, riding a white stallion, leads British troops through the channel tunnel and begins the invasion of France. Paris falls within three weeks. As part of the terms of surrender, henceforth only cheddar cheese may be sold in the country. The French have no choice but to accept.

But sure, look at China. They didn't even change their government much and simply went from a closed economy to a more free market economy. They dropped their poverty rate from something like 88% to like 6% from 1985 to this decade as a result.

The same happened to basically all the ex-Soviet states.

After the industrial revolution markets became freer  and that's when western countries started becoming better and better off.

Rather than me giving you examples, it should be you that gives me examples about instances where a market that's not free led to anything *but* misery compared to freer markets.

In many respects, the U.S. Congress is driving U.S. policy toward Africa with its numerous and highly relevant legislative initiatives. However, until the executive branch provides diplomatic and policy leadership, the U.S.-Africa partnership will not fulfill its considerable potential.

5323,"Nationale Volksarmee surplus gear is very cheap to buy, and is actually excellent quality for the price in my opinion.

I've got a Strichtarn jacket, assault pack, and NBC suit [(cheeki breeki).](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BG_OR0xIsyo/maxresdefault.jpg)

I use this stuff combined with other euro milsurp for very minimalist camping. 

Recently destroyed my tent &amp; I'm thinking about picking up a few NVA Zeltbahns, since they're substantially cheaper than earlier Wehrmacht ones (even repros are lots of $$$), though the cut isn't as nice. The point being that when it rains, I can re purpose one and wear it, and therefore I have less to carry.

Speaking on the jacket, pretty well every time i've worn it outside of a camping situation I've gotten compliments on it since Strichtarn is quite nice looking. One time I bumped into some older Germans while I had it in my bag tucked away so they didn't see it.

~ This leads me to ask out to any Germans, is there any sort of stigma towards former East German army gear? On one hand I could imagine it being very polarizing, or maybe people just don't care. Sometimes I wonder if that interaction I had would've been a little less friendly (or maybe ecstatic?) had they seen me draped in former Socialist surplus. 

Another thing I know regarding the NVA, is that after reunification, the high ranking officers were dismissed and not accepted into the Bundewehr, the majority of soldiers in general got sent home, and for a long time from what I read, former NVA personalle were recognized as having served ""a foreign power,"" and not recognized as regular German veterans.

Was there any kind of outrage to this treatment? I'm actually sort of surprised that on reunification eastern soldiers were not treated as equals, and I figured that at least German leftists would've opposed this. Instead, it sounds more like they got treated like Waffen-SS.",Canada,/r/europe/comments/8vtxhz/what_do_you_know_about_the_gdr/e1qgl6i/,ArkanSaadeh,1530645055

&gt;Romania in its history has been culturally closer to the other ""Balkan"" countries than to any other group of countries. 

Romania is culturally closer to the Balkans, that is true. At the same time, I don't think we fit into any group completely, from our different history under communism to the fact that we speak a different language to our neighbours except Moldova, much like the Hungarians. 

I don't feel the need to put Romania in any category besides its geographical position. We are close to the Balkans, we also share many things with Hungarians, despite our conflicts, and Transilvania feels close to Central Europe, including Germany, and Moldova in the east and our Romanians in Ukraine.

Exactly, that’s my point. The US was completely honest and transparent to the Russians. We told them it wasn’t in our interest to expand NATO at the moment, but we weren’t ruling it out in the future. At that was exactly what happened. NATO didn’t expand until a decade after that meeting. That’s not a trick and certainly was not a promise. 



We didn’t put it in writing because there was no promise to put in writing. We made no promise because the USSR was falling apart before our eyes and they had no leverage. Why would we ever promise not to expand NATO to Poland or the Baltic’s? They were sovereign states and the Warsaw Pact had already fallen apart. The Russians extracted no promises because hey had no leverage to get any promises 


&gt;Western leaders made these promises because Gorbachev needed at least something to convince the hardliners back home 


I literally just gave you a quote from Gorbachev where he said there was no discussion of NATO expansion. Don’t listen to me, listen to Gorbachev. He knows more about it than we do


&gt;Because there's no need to and wise statecraft would have recognised that bringing them into the NATO fold was the quickest way to ensure further Russian troubles throughout the region?


I’m not sure about this. Russia has invaded Ukraine and gone to war with Georgia. Neither of those nations are in NATO. Actually the reason Russia intervened in Ukraine was because Ukraine was getting closer relations with the EU, not NATO.


In any case, the Eastern Europeans have broadly united against Russia and have become more integrated and westernized with things like NATO.

There is a bit of an issue where there is an over-spill of legitimate criticism of Israel and Israeli government policies and Jewish people more generally too.  

I think in the last 8 years or so I've attended about half a dozen talks/workshops where some attendees were openly anti-Semetic, and where there was little push back from the other attendees, and indeed where speakers encouraged those positions. They were almost all somewhat fringe left, or fringe right (as opposed to far/alt- left/right, although there was clearly some overlap..).  That said, you sort of have to look for it, it's not like the average person (just based on turnout..) is likely to end up attending something like that, and it doesn't often spill out into the general public discourse, except in a political context.

I'll add that it's a really odd experience, having someone talk about the failures of capitalism, or the failure of the social order, or the demise of Christianity or whatever their hobby horse happens to be, and them dropping in a reference to Jewish conspiracy theories as though it's just well understood fact, and people nodding along.

Because we have had some of the most famous scientist in history, some of the best artists, explorers, we pretty much invented the stock market the modern economy runs on, fought and even won multiple wars against the larger English, French and Spanish countries, had a people that refused to be conquered even in Roman times and after with the Frisians (which back then was more then just modern Friesland and included Holland/West-Friesland), are known for giant infrastructure projects and respected in managing water all across the world.

It's sad that like you say, all the focus is on a few things that are made into a problem and being proud of your country is sometimes seen as something wrong.

5587,"&gt;WTF do they expect? Full-blown riots on the streets?

Basically. This argument was made by the older generations mostly, especially my grandparents, parents and uncles/aunts. They all seemed to believe that the new directive can't be such a huge problem, otherwise there would be massive protests and lots of media coverage - the lack thereof made them think it's just a minor annoyance and thus not really relevant, respectively blown out of proportion by our generation (mid 20s/30s). Discussions with a few parents of some friends were similar in that regard.

I wouldn't say the older generations don't care, I guess they just lack the understanding of what the internet is and how it is used and why these changes will have negative impact. For them, the internet is mainly for entertainment and sending emails. They don't use facebook much, they don't surf, they don't use it for information (since they mostly watch TV, buy newspapers, etc), using their phones for essential messaging and calls only. They are what I like to call ""minimalistic users"".

I'm also pretty sure that there are parents and grandparents out there who are actively trying to fight the copyright directive. But there also are people who have lived their lives without the internet and even though they use it now, they don't understand all the fuss because they can easily live with no internet as well.

We even have a few professors at uni who made some really stupid remarks about this, saying that the young generation should rather focus on more important issues than some EU internet law - hearing this from people who call themselves intellectuals and academics really gave me food for thought.

&gt; It is a turn of phrase obviously, not sure if you are perhaps autistic or not adept at English. The idea is that if you encourage usage on websites that don't do region blocking for legal reasons then the most successful websites will all follow that model with others that follow suit.


Speaking of autism, you didn't get what I wrote. The content some people are after is often unique to a specific site. There are no alternatives. 


The ""others that follow suit"" argument is also dubious quality.

5696,"You'd be surprised how many people still wouldn't care, simply because for them, the internet is just pure entertainment and nothing more.

During the past 2-3 weeks, I've had various discussions with different friends and family members on this topic. These are the most common answers/reactions:

1) not much will change, because it won't have as much impact as all the nerdy drama queens are claiming it to have

2) if it will have negative impact, it's only because these businesses/services are not able to adapt, thus ""good riddance""

3) in case certain content is not available, there are enough alternatives available so there is no need to get involved in any way

4) if flow of information will change in a bad way, there will be internet activists to make sure we can overcome these restrictions for sure if really essential

5) not really bad changes because internet is mainly entertainment these days with low effort contributions and tons of spam -&gt; more regulation and more control is needed

So people either do not care at all, they don't really see how this would have negative impact or are glad someone is doing something about the current state of the internet which they see as the virtual wild west that needs to be contained and fixed asap by governments and agencies around the world.

To be honest, all these discussions were pretty interesting, mostly because I was able to get a better understanding of how less tech-savvy people around me perceive the internet, its uses and benefits overall.

But it also was a bit sad and frustrating to realize that before even having these discussions, most people didn't really know what it all was about other than ""some EU vote about the internet people are talking about"" - which implies that way too many people might actually not fully understand the situation and/or are not interested enough to spend a few minutes of their daily browsing to get some facts on a matter that is present in the media but which they don't fully understand.

This seems to be a general behaviour I have observed for quite some time now: people rather stay uninformed about something - or half-informed at times - and have literally *zero* incentive to follow up and dig deeper. They rather move on to other fun things in life instead and are quite easygoing about their lack of knowledege and facts, leaving everything to the representative democracy they have voted for. This is super scary and problematic imho.

Apart from that, what worried my additionally was mostly the non-interest/non-concern of most of my friends while or after discussing the topic and the vast majority really didn't care more about the topic, even after providing them with good reasons to care about the upcoming vote. 

In fact, only 4 out of 67 family members and close friends actually did contact a representative after being presented with the option. It then was again interesting to see how many would react positively that someone had taken action and thus felt that the issue was basically resolved and that they didn't have to become active themselves anymore, almost feeling relieved that someone else did it for them. 

_____

We can argue about how much impact these changes will or will not have - in the end we can only observe the results. What concerns me the most is the lack of interest, incentive and 	sense of responsibility when it comes to being an active citizen within a democratic system. 

It almost feels like many people are happy to vote once every few years to give certain people the needed power to make decisions for everyone of us - but are less inclined to follow these developments, and if they do, not inclined to do something about it if it is not in their interest - and even less inclined to even catch up on developments that seem irrelevant to them but actually may not be. The very simple and naive feeling of ""this sure does not concern me"" (which is based on nothing at all) seems to be quite strong.

I used to ""diagnose"" this as apathy, but I'm not sure this really is the case. I think people have become less aware of what is happening outside their own bubble (due to lack of education mostly, unable to analyze and comprehend our entire system) and also too lazy to keep up with everything that is going on. 

Maybe it is information overload, maybe it is just escaping reality whenever possible - I don't know. What I do know is that with such an attitude (or behaviour) we can not stop negative developments within our nations and will only make it easier for anyone who tries to sabotage democracy, which will probably result in more authoritarian systems.

5735,"Corporations by nature aim to maximize profits:

Employee wages are as low as it makes sense in terms of remaining competitive on the job market; companies will rarely overpay their workers in order to ""be nice"". This is evident when comparing wages to profits between different sectors/industries. A burger-flipper in a fast food restaurant won't earn significantly less than an IT pro because the chain is making less money, but because there's a lot more people waiting in line for their job. As such, high corporate taxes are unlikely to hit employee wages first, because employee wages are *already* the primary target whenever a company wants to save money on anything. Which also means the margin for further cuts is very low.

Similarly, unless a company has a monopoly position or engages in illegal price cartels, it will invariably aim to offer its products as cheap as possible to be competitive on the global market.

It is certainly possible that product prices would see *some* form of rise, or that wages would see *some* form of stagnation, but I would expect this to be outliers and not at all in the same ballpark as taxation. Much more likely is lower dividends on shareholders and a slower expansion. The latter would make it easier for smaller start-ups to cover niches, whereas I just don't see the former as a significant issue when compared to the good that can come out of corporate taxes (this can be pensions, too). The ""little man"" may partake in a pension scheme that incorporates stock market speculation, but the number of participants in the scheme as well as the number of companies will cushion significant ups or downs, as they already do. The *individual* shareholders that would be hit the most are those that already have enough money to stomach the loss.

Ideally, large corporations would of course start to save money starting from the top, cutting down on the sometimes ridiculous wages and bonuses of top-level executives, but since those decisions are also made on a similar level, this is unlikely to happen.

Thus, I suppose the question is more in regards to what exactly we regard as ""excessive"", and what we see as the consequences for the economy. Looking at Germany with its 15% corporate tax, I have to say I fail to see the negative impact you assert.

&gt; Increase land taxes for example if you must.

My goddness. What I mean was that nobody outlawed orthodox church in PLC.

I cannot expalin it more simple. 

I never said that PLC was heaven or anything in this sort, and yes orthodox church was persecuted after 1596, because state was pushing union. But it basically ended in 1607 and 1635.

It employs languague with respect to the head of governemnt of a friendly neighbour that is at best uncouth and at worst pretty hateful. The sop about ""wonderful people"" (FAO *The* *Sun* Editor: Do fuck off) cuts no ice.

It's true to say that Brexit is ""more bad"" for Ireland than the rest of the EU. No-one disputes this. What is risible however is the notion that Britain is in no way reliant on Ireland. Ireland has been a cornerstone of Britain's food security since the industrial revolution. If all the Irish NHS staff left in the morning then the whole system would be in crisis. If the very profitable markets many UK businesses operate in here were closed off then Britain would suffer too. IIRC, at the time of our financial crisis and the loan (more of which anon) Britain gave us, Cameron justified it on the basis of how tied our two economies were - completey out of proportion to the size of the Irish economy.

Now, that loan. It was offered to us alongside loans from Sweden and Denmark (Thanks, lads BTW) but unlike those loans HMG insisted on a very high interest rate and would not accept early repayment. So in Britain's case, this was less of a Corinthian loan and more of a Nice Little Earner. 

As for the long memory of British consumers? Aye, right. You're the ones with long memories...

In short, the Brexit path being pursued right now by May is ruinous to both Britain \*AND\* Ireland.

5910,"&gt; Nuclear energy is not profitable because it costs a fortune to build new nuclear plants. Once the plants are built they are very cheap to operate per unit of energy produced. That's why shutting down already built plants made little sense. The cost for them was already spent. 

Some of them are already at the end of their lifetime, though. And the more modern ones are still running some years. Actually its done in the way you are proposing: mostly by not building new ones and waiting until the old ones are too unsafe/too expensive to maintain.

&gt; I honestly do not understand the nuclear waste concerns. If we wanted to, we could just bury them underground in the middle of nowhere

There is no ""middle of nowhere"" in Germany as it is densely populated. Burying it is therefore relatively irresponsible. No other country wanted to deposit it for us, too. What if a earthquake hits the deposit? What if it is filled by water that leaks slowly into nature? What if thieves try to extract it? All this things may be no problem today. But what is about 100 or 200 years in the future? The knowledge about this deposits also could be easily lost after a war.

It's not uncommon to work 18 -20 days 12h shifts from May to October. Default procedure in hospitality services. Cooks, waiters and bartenders all do that. One might think that hospitality does not reflect real situation in a country but I would argue that in Latvia hospitality and construction workers represent the bulk of the middle class. 200 h in let's say 16 - 20 days is not that bad when you get used to and if you get to work with people. Very few employers pay holiday and night shift rates and at least half salary is in cash so to speak. So the myth of pension is nothing more than that. 

Hard to imagine what it must be in factory type of work. Soul must be dying then indeed. If you are introverted it is a major disadvantage, if you are agreeable trouble as well. Lower cognitive abilities majorly fucked.  

And of course there is undeniable brain drain going on there is no good reason but heavy duty nationalism to come back.

5982,"&gt;There is no ""middle of nowhere"" in Germany as it is densely populated. Burying it is therefore relatively irresponsible. No other country wanted to deposit it for us, too. What if a earthquake hits the deposit? What if it is filled by water that leaks slowly into nature? What if thieves try to extract it? All this things may be no problem today. But what is about 100 or 200 years in the future? The knowledge about this deposits also could be easily lost after a war.

I mean, you could bury it 2 kilometers beneath the ground and fill it with concrete. Most water aquifers are only around 200 meters beneath the surface. If we've learned anything from oil and gas it's that we can dig holes really deep. 

I would even say to just fill it it with concrete and lead and drop it in the middle of the pacific in a trench. More or a political problem than a pragmatic one. The French get 80&amp;#37; of their power from nuclear, they seem to have it figure out ok. 

Thieves wouldn't try to extract it, the waste you're disposing of is not worth anything and if you buried it deep enough they wouldn't be able to get it anyway. ",,/r/europe/comments/8vf18l/us_romanian_black_sea_reserves_promising_source/e1pfnwe/,sandyhands2,1530602567

Then the long term problems from cultural differences for examples with Islamic Arabs and the effect on the overall political and value system and internal strife are hard to quantify.

5998,"&gt;I can partially understand this reasoning, but I wonder - is it really historically accurate? As far as I know, the Red Army barely moved a finger in Warsaw.

I would personally prefer returning to the Imperial naming that gave troops names based on the town they are gathered from. It's more logical inconsistent though with modern Russian army deliberately completing regiments with recruits from different regions and that those organizations have no relation to imperial ones anyway. So the other scheme is ok too.

Warsaw can have nuances, but it's either ""finished with liquidating the Polish Resistance"" or ""mostly gone anyway"". Also divisions are named for Warsaw-Poznan operation not the city itself, ""for exemplary fulfilling the given taks"" and commanded by Zhukov who was punished by Moscow immediately after the victory and later assassinated one of the most disgusting guys there.",Russia,/r/europe/comments/8vilsy/putin_names_regiments_after_ukrainian_belarusian/e1pfqe9/,yasenfire,1530602699
