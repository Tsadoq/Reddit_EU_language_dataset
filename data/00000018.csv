You live in an Orwellian state. At any point, a well-connected party official can put you in jail and you can do nothing about it. China showed its freedom of religion as seen by Muslim minorities being brainwashed in concentration camps. Tibet being abused. China is light years behind the west and far behind Poland on human rights in many forms. In fact, it has been abusing human rights horribly at this very moment.

A major historical and cultural centre (""the cultural capital of Russia"") and an important port, St. Petersburg lies about 640 km northwest of Moscow and only about 7¬∞ south of the Arctic Circle. It is the second largest city of Russia and one of the world‚Äôs major cities. 

St. Petersburg has played a vital role in Russian history since its founding in 1703. For two centuries (1712‚Äì1918) it was the capital of the Russian Empire. The city is remembered as the scene of the February and October Revolutions of 1917 and for its fierce defense while [besieged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Leningrad) during World War II. 

Architecturally, it ranks as one of the most splendid and congenial cities of Europe. Its historic district was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1990. 

The city was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on 27 May 1703 on the site of a captured Swedish fortress, and was named after apostle Saint Peter. Saint Petersburg is historically and culturally associated with the birth of the Russian Empire and Russia's entry into modern history as a European great power.

It served as a capital of the Tsardom of Russia and the subsequent Russian Empire from 1713 to 1918 (being replaced by Moscow for a short period of time between 1728 and 1730). After the October Revolution in 1917, the Bolsheviks moved their government to Moscow.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/nlzlmu/27_may_1703_tsar_peter_the_great_founds_the_city/gzlokbr/,filosoful,1622090415

And if you think this conflict started then, and was started by Armenians... Well I guess Azeri ""historians"" are doing a fine job teaching the citizens their made up bullshit. That conflict was born in the wake of WWI, and because politicians on both sides were too stupid and selfish to see they had been played by the Soviets. 

Karabach should have never been given to Azerbaijan, since it was majority Armenian. Even by the Azeri's own cencus it was over 94% Armenian in 1921. They should have dumped it with Armenia as soon as they could. Instead they made it an ethnic enclave, and then later on tried to Azerify it. Well how do you think a people with a genocide fresh in their memory are gonna react? The Azeri's were given a mine and decided to step on it on purpose, then complain about the explosion and carnage that came afterwards. Why was it needed to keep Karabach, when they could have forseen that the Armenians would not accept their kin there being mistreated, and when they didn't like the Armenians in the first place? Don't go placing the entire blame on Armenia, give your own country some credit for their efforts as well, since they made all the wrong choices as well.

&gt;Not even bloody Putin is stupid enough to bring back communism

thats not how it works lol. he prefers to be king.

&gt;and even CCP took in some capitalist ideas to save China from imminent collapse

this is completely ahistorical. one of the fundamental concepts in marxism is historical materialism. its a description of the relationships of production throughout history. primitive communism&gt;feudalism&gt;capitalism&gt;socialism&gt;communism. in prehistory the earth provided enough surplus for everyone, we had a stateless, moneyless, classless society. then technology improved so populations increased which necessitated new social relations so we got feudalism to mediate problems between groups. feudalism created new problems and the solution to those problems was capitalism. capitalism was an improvement over feudalism but its not the end of history as the consummate idiot francis fukuyama said. capitalism creates new problems like unequal distribution of resources, class stratification, social hierarchies. these problems create class warfare like when rich people decide poor people dont deserve food or healthcare or housing. they prioritize their profits over the health of the planet and kill poor people through pollution. the solution to this is to democratize the economy and give everybody a say instead of allowing it to be a dictatorship of the capitalist class, this is called socialism. the goal of socialism is to increase technology and productive capacity to the point where we can have a classless, stateless, moneyless society again.

now this is relevant because the communist revolutions happened in feudal societies instead of already industrialized capitalist one like marx thought, so lenin and mao had to adapt marx to the conditions of their countries. according to historical materialism, capitalism is what comes after feudalism so it makes sense that communist governments allow highly regulated aspects of capitalism to develop the productive forces up to the point when they can transition to socialism. only idiots who have never read any theory think that communism is a thing that can be achieved immediately through legislation. its a historical process that takes hundreds of years, just like the transition from feudalism to capitalism. and also just like the early attempts at communism, early attempts at democratic, capitalist republics failed and killed millions. look at the french republic, the old system didnt even need to win on the field of battle to kill it, they only had to apply enough pressure to necessitate a strong central government and napoleon declared himself emperor. does that mean democracy shouldnt be tried again? of course not. because capitalism is a more efficient than feudalism it was inevitable that it would win one day, same with socialism. there is nothing you can do to stop it, the capitalist can fund and train death quads and kill millions of workers like theyve been doing but theyre only delaying the inevitable.

&gt;racist basement dwellers like Marx

thats hilarious coming from somebody who wants to get rid of the government so there is no age of consent laws. not only are you a nazi but you are a pedo. if there was successful minarchist revolution then the state would reform itself eventually because you have no mechanism in your ideology to alleviate the material conditions that necessitate the existence of the state. as long as scarcity exist so will social strife, nobody will respect the nap when their life is on the line so your minarchism requires violence to enforce private property. so you are just a nazi and a pedo who is too autistic to have empathy for others.",,/r/europe/comments/nlghpj/romania_will_change_the_name_of_the_street_where/gzkyzpe/,Cumtown_Sweatshop,1622075822

566,"Yeah. Me and all the dictionaries don't get it, but *you* do üôÑ

Colonialism involves colonies, but not all colonies are colonialist. They're two distinct concepts. One has been with us since the migration of early humans began. The other was an ideological project which involved a particular *use* of *colonies* (among other tools) to bring as much of the world as possible under Western European dominion, complete with cod-scienctific and cod-religious justifications. 

Colonialism has, arguably, never ceased, only metamorphosed to colonialism 2.0, by aggressive capitalist Europe 2.0  (USA + chums), with religion 2.0 (human rights, ""health"", secularism, etc). Same old economic, political and cultural methods of domination, but ditching the actual conquest and annexation of physical land. Or doing it by stealth (""liberating"" places and installing puppet governments). 

In the same way that the Welsh and Polish ""participated"" (or didn't) in slavery, land grabbing, and extinction of indigenous peoples, to the extent  that they were forced to by their conquerors, you could say those of us buying mass produced cheap clothing with a million air miles and child labour tears in every stitch, are (or are not) participating in the nasty shit the West is doing to the rest of the world. 

In that we kinda are. But yet, we don't have a lot of choice.

Dairy corporations have already successfully lobbied the EU to force their competitors to use awkward names like  ""oat beverage"", which doesn't really describe what it's supposed to be used as - milk.  I personally think that calling it an oat beverage/drink is more deceptive than using the term milk.

The main problem with this argument is that we generally do not restrict people from having children based on the possible outcome of birth defects.  

German Society of Human Genetics 
&gt; Not only do incestuous relationships of siblings have no appreciable influence on the gene pool of a population anyway; the (definitely existing) higher risk that children from such relationships might contract recessively inherited diseases does not justify a legal intervention in the ""reproductive freedom"" of a couple. The danger of such diseases (e.g.: cystic fibrosis or spinal muscular atrophy) naturally also exists for children of non-blood-related couples. If such a disease is already present in a child, its siblings have a 25% risk of also getting the hereditary disease. For some diseases, this risk is much higher. However, legislation prohibiting further sexual intercourse in such cases would meet with widespread social rejection, and the right to make one's own risk assessment associated with the desire to have a child would be part of the core of personal rights.",Pfalz,/r/europe/comments/nlgfek/legality_of_incest/gzjixwa/,punicar,1622052432

Or perhaps , even worse they knew Russia is gonna react and just didn't care. In any case both of these developments ended in a catastrophe for Ukraine and Georgia.

774,"Paywall, article here:

&gt;The European Union is aiming to hit Belarus with a new round of sanctions by June over the forced landing of Ryanair flight FR4978 and the arrest of a journalist, with tougher economic measures to follow by the summer, according to an EU official familiar with the matter.

&gt;The more stringent measures could target potash, a soil nutrient used to improve crops, the official said, asking not to be named discussing private conversations. Potash is the country‚Äôs major export -- supplying a large share of European demand -- and its only abundant mineral resource.

&gt;The EU has already sanctioned seven Belarusian entities and 88 individuals, including discredited president, Alexander Lukashenko, and was already working on adding more people to that list over their support for the regime and the repressions of protests. Following agreement between EU leaders on Monday to sanction Belarus further, that list is now expected to expand to include people involved in the Ryanair incident and should be adopted by the bloc‚Äôs foreign ministers on June 21.

&gt;The EU leaders also called for the adoption of ‚Äútargeted economic sanctions‚Äù and work on preparing the framework to allow for these new measures has also begun.

&gt;The exact sectors to target have yet to be defined but are likely to include areas such as potash where state enterprises are most active, according to the EU official. Belarus is one of the world‚Äôs biggest exporters of potash and as such any restrictions could impact global markets. Other targets could include Belavia, the country‚Äôs national airline.
Fertilizer Superpower

&gt;Belarus is the world‚Äôs third-biggest producer of potash

&gt;‚ÄúIt makes no sense rocking Belarus,‚Äù Lukashenko told a gathering of lawmakers and officials in Minsk Wednesday. He said events around Belarus constituted ‚Äúhybrid warfare,‚Äù state-owned news agency Belta said.

&gt;Lukashenko defended his actions in Sunday‚Äôs Ryanair flight incident and said that Belarus will ‚Äúcompensate‚Äù for possible Western sanctions by going to other markets and fostering its close ties with Russia.

&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôll substitute Europe, which is growing mercilessly old, for rapidly growing Asia,‚Äù he said.

&gt;The EU measures will need to name specific sectors and be clearly defined so as to withstand potential legal proceedings and win the backing of all member states. Forging unanimity between EU governments has proved tricky lately, with several countries keen to avoid hurting their economies or dent controversial political alliances.

&gt;‚ÄúA lot will depend of what type of sanctions are implemented,‚Äù said Elena Sakhnova, an analyst at VTB Capital. ‚ÄúIf those are just sectoral penalties, such as limiting Belarus potash industry‚Äôs ability to get financing in European banks, this won‚Äôt cause disruption on the market as Belarus uses alternative sources of funding anyway.‚Äù
Potential Impact

&gt;More meaningful penalties would prevent European companies from trading with the Belarusian potash industry, though Belarus would still be able to divert from Europe to other markets, primarily Asia, Sakhnova said.

&gt;That may cause a short-term increase in potash prices in Europe, as Belarus supplies about 25% of the region‚Äôs demand, though the situation should normalize fairly quickly, she said. Producers like Russia‚Äôs Uralkali PJSC may replace Belarusian volumes in Europe, she said.

&gt;Speaking to European parliament‚Äôs foreign affairs committee on Wednesday, exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya urged the EU to ban exports of potash, oil products and timber, as well as halting lending to Belarusian banks.

&gt;Potash producer Belaruskali is one of the largest state-owned companies in Belarus. Minsk-based state-owned Belarusian Potash Co. is a trader, handling export sales of all potash produced in Belarus.

&gt;‚ÄúThere is too much speculative information about the topic‚Äù, Belarusian Potash Co.‚Äôs press service said by email. BPC, as the company is also known, said it hopes for a ‚Äúmeasured and reasonable‚Äù approach in the matter as potash supplies are important for food safety and agriculture industry in the countries that buy the nutrient.

&gt;In addition to sanctions, some member states will be withdrawing their aviation agreements with Belarus, while governments are also discussing banning Belarusian carriers‚Äô access to the EU, including overflights and landing rights, according to the same official.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/nlnkbr/eu_may_sanction_belaruss_potash_industry_by_this/gzjjyy4/,Canal_Volphied,1622052868

784,"&gt;International support for Belarusian Protasevich is currently undermined by pushing two major narratives. The first one is whataboutism about Evo Morales grounding incident in 2013, and the second one is ‚ÄúProtasevich is a neo-Nazi.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Meduza journalist Alexey Kovalyov managed to find the primary source of the fake claim: a post from September 2020 in a pro-Lukashenko anonymous Telegram channel. Other users attributed it to pro-Kremlin pundit Sergey Markov or to Russian propagandist media News Front. The problem seemed to be solved, the sources of fake information seemed to be found.  
&gt;  
&gt;But suddenly, western journalists who report on the Ukrainian far-right decided to ride the wave.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bellingcat researcher Oleksiy Kuzmenko found somewhere in Telegram a cover for Azov Black Sun magazine which shows a young man in a uniform with a combat weapon with suggestions that it is Protasevich.  
&gt;  
&gt;To be fair, the author of this text has seen this information nearly six hours before Kuzmenko. It was posted on a small Telegram channel whose administrator is allegedly a former anarchist and a dishonest drug dealer from Azov circles who moved out of Ukraine, fearing consequences for his frauds. Also, he allegedly spreads rumors that Azov leaders attend a synagogue. Not the most reliable source in the world, I guess. A good example of why local expertise from the ground matters for correctly interpreting materials found in open sources!  
&gt;  
&gt;Then, he uses some neural network demo software to compare this picture with the portrait of Protasevich, and it shows they are similar. Both the person on the cover and Protasevich, indeed, share a rather common Slavic anthropologic type, and I do not want to sound ad hominem here, but cannot help mentioning that Kuzmenko himself belongs to this type as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;The cover and the screenshot of the comparison are shared together, and, while somewhere at the end of the thread Kuzmenko admits it is not the strong proof in itself, the damage is already done: the magazine cover starts circulating widely, for sure, mostly by anonymous accounts.Then, users from Ukraine find another person who could probably be on this cover. This was Andriy Snitko, an actual Azov serviceman who also looked quite similar. He died in 2014 in Ilovaisk, being only 18 years old, and was awarded the Hero of Ukraine title.  
&gt;  
&gt;This version was directly confirmed by Azov unit veteran and former National Corps politician Serhiy Filimonov. Another confirmation, though an indirect one, is that the magazine cover (can be accessed here) contains a verse about a tragic battle among sunflowers, an image well-known to be associated with Ilovaisk.",,/r/europe/comments/nlnf86/no_belarusian_dissident_protasevich_is_not_a/gzjk31n/,Greener_alien,1622052916

&gt;That's a common misconception. International law is quite clear on the rights of independence of Artsakh. The international community doesn't recognize its independence, but those are 2 different things.  
&gt;  
&gt;Regarding the law, international law grants right to self determination to ""all peoples""; i.e. ""[the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination)"". Moreover, this is a ""[Peremptory norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peremptory_norm)"" which means it's non-negotiable and non-consensual (i.e. you don't need someone else's approval before you apply self determination).  
&gt;  
&gt;Regarding the community, my speculation is that it's mostly motivated by practical politics. Not even Armenia recognizes Artsakh's independence, so why would anyone else do so first. There's a great [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXFlrt1jgfQ) video explaining the nuances and why it's independence is clearly legal by international law.",,/r/europe/comments/nkshtg/dutch_parliament_adopts_resolution_eu_should/gzijyr0/,junvar0,1622038053

But this integration between countries can come to an end if enough nationalistic demagogues get their way. So you should be concerned, and question, anti-EU nationalistic policies. Because things can change fast. Look at the republican party in the USA, almost half the population supports them.

Turkey has started their own military industry 40 years ago.Can we say the same thing for Greece? With 10mil and mostly dependent on Tourists what do Greece has to put on the table?You bought many many expensive jets and they will cost you.You don t have the combat experience and population to protect your borders,so you are inviting USA to protect you instead(A lot of nww Bases,remember?). Europe is so busy with their self created heaven and so arrogant,they can not see the Chinese are already infltrated their borders.Now let us come to Military.

So congrats, you're on the same level as Erdogan, what a great light it sheds on Morocco.

I'm not saying Morocco has to be happy about Spain's decision to treat the guy. But there are more humane ways to manifest your discontent with a diplomatic decision. I'm just saying that Morocco needs to learn how to react as a civilized country instead of weaponizing masses of poor people to get what they want.

Dracula has been assigned to many literary genres including vampire literature, horror fiction, gothic fiction, and invasion literature.

The US didn't set any precedent, anyone saying that is just trying to justify this act by Belarus. Also several western powers apologized for their part in it. But there was no need for condemnation since that ability to close airspace to a state flight is a right any country has.

&gt;US even sent a rendition plane to Denmark in anticipation of arresting snowden.

Sure

&gt;watching this sub trying to parse out the differences to justify that both incidents are different is HILARIOUS.

Watching all the shills trying and spin closing airspace to a state flight, and a bomb threat with an armed fighter escort as being the same thing is also HILARIOUS.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/nk4d36/as_anger_toward_belarus_mounts_recall_the_2013/gzhaxxm/,zxcv1992,1622005837

Based on what I've read, I think that France brings the most baggage WRT exportability.  France requires that the plane be capable of operating from a CATOBAR carrier, because France intends to continue to operate one.  That imposes some level of design constraints (to the point that the US was willing to design a CATOBAR-capable version and a non-CATOBAR-version of the F-35).

I think I am in agreement. I read the article and at first I didn't understand what the issue was as I took it as Kurti asking for the removal of ""in danger"" status. I took it as Kurti is saying that these churches are no longer in danger, and by maintaining the current status UNESCO is negatively stigmatizing Kosovar people.

However, I really do not understand what they gain by trying to separate Serbia from those churches. I guess they are angling it as Kosovo includes ethnic Albanians AND ethnic Serbs therefore this heritage is part of Kosovo (though really linked to the Serbs). I don't know about that claim that they were built on catholic churches,...likely false but it doesn't matter here. 

Long story short I fail to see how it can be seen like anything else but short sighted revisionism. I also think Kurti has much bigger fish to fry than this.

1710,"&gt;Boris Johnson will welcome Viktor Orban, the rightwing populist Hungarian prime minister, to Downing Street on Friday, with Number 10 claiming co-operation with Budapest was ‚Äúvital to the UK‚Äôs security and prosperity‚Äù.

&gt;Orban, an ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin, has a fractious relationship with many EU leaders and has been actively courting investment from China in recent years.

&gt;But he is a rare admirer of Johnson inside the EU and last year described Johnson and former US president Donald Trump as ‚Äúthe most courageous, the most dynamic and the most ready to effect change‚Äù of all the politicians in the world.

&gt;Post-Brexit tensions are high between Britain and the EU, particularly over the issue of border controls in Northern Ireland, and Johnson will be grateful for any support he can get around the summit table in Brussels.

&gt;But Orban‚Äôs visit to Downing Street sits uneasily with Johnson‚Äôs attempt at next month‚Äôs G7 summit in Cornwall to forge a coalition of western democracies to act as a counterweight to authoritarian rivals like China.

&gt;I‚Äôm not sure Orban is a massively useful ally on anything much, given his current standing in Europe and internationally. But on balance I support the prime minister talking to any EU leader, even Orban.

&gt;Kim Darroch, former UK ambassador to the EU
Hungary has this year twice vetoed EU statements condemning the erosion of democracy in Hong Kong. Orban has also vetoed Ukraine‚Äôs attempts to forge closer links with Nato.

&gt;The Hungarian leader‚Äôs domestic record ‚Äî he has referred to ‚ÄúMuslim invaders‚Äù and called migrants ‚Äúpoison‚Äù ‚Äî has earned him many critics on the British left and the timing of the visit is awkward.

&gt;On Tuesday, a highly critical independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party found institutional failings in how it handled complaints of anti-Muslim prejudice.

&gt;Downing Street said ‚Äúwhere we have concerns about human rights we do not shy away from raising them‚Äù but added that co-operation with Hungary was ‚Äúvital to the UK‚Äôs security and prosperity‚Äù.

&gt;A spokesman noted Hungary was president of the Visegrad group, which also includes Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and was a vital regional player in the fight against organised crime.

&gt;Lisa Nandy, shadow foreign secretary, said Johnson should¬†press Orban on human rights, press freedom and his record on anti-Semitism and also urge him to take ‚Äúa robust stance towards the Lukashenko regime in Belarus and Putin‚Äôs Russia‚Äù.

&gt;Kim Darroch, former UK ambassador to the EU, said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure Orban is a massively useful ally on anything much, given his current standing in Europe and internationally. But on balance I support the prime minister talking to any EU leader, even Orban.‚Äù

&gt;Budapest stands accused of backsliding on democratic standards and the rule of law by many of its EU partners and civil society groups. The European Parliament initiated sanctions proceedings against Hungary for breaching EU values in 2018 although the¬†process has little chance of succeeding because its ally Poland can block any punishment.

&gt;Hungary‚Äôs last parliamentary elections in 2018 were deemed free but not fair by the OSCE, Europe‚Äôs election standards watchdog, because Orban‚Äôs party Fidesz¬†‚Äúenjoyed an undue advantage because of a pervasive overlap between state and ruling party resources, biased media coverage and opaque campaign financing regulations.‚Äù

&gt;Brussels has repeatedly raised concerns over degrading democratic standards in the country, ranging from persecution of the media to increased government oversight of universities and the Orban government‚Äôs adoption of emergency decree powers.

&gt;Last June Orban urged the EU to drop sanctions against Belarus after meeting its authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko in Minsk. But this week Hungary joined the EU in condemning the actions of Belarus over the forced redirection of a Ryanair flight.

&gt;In a sign of UK/EU tensions, Emmanuel Macron, French president, this week accused Britain at a European Council meeting of failing to respect its Brexit treaty with the EU, whether regarding the Irish border or fisheries.

&gt;‚ÄúWe stand ready to defend our interests and ensure these agreements are applied,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe will not in any case accept any weakness.‚Äù

&gt;Macron added: ‚ÄúIf these situations are difficult to manage it‚Äôs precisely because of Brexit and in no case because of the EU.‚Äù",Bermuda,/r/europe/comments/nl19yu/johnson_to_welcome_orban_to_downing_street_on/gzfzath/,cazorlas_weak_foot,1621980514

So maybe, just maybe, having a tougher leadership that values discipline more isn't such a bad idea. I know you euroliberals only care about these globalist initiatives, but us, the majority, value little things more, like having a clean city and respectable people around you.

As for the dictator accusations. Our Liberal government and liberal president has literally declared an unconstitutional martial law in 2020, putting soldiers with loaded machine guns on the streets.

The thing is though that this is exactly what happened in Ireland (and everyone knows it's not healthy). Before multinationals came in the 90s Ireland had generation after generation of youth emigration because there were literally no prospects here.

The idea that Ireland would be one of the richest countries in Europe and that people would actually be coming here in big numbers to get good paying jobs in technical disciplines would have been fantasy just 2 generations ago and no government is going to start making changes that would endanger it (outside of closing the tax avoiding loopholes which everyone thought were disgraceful).",,/r/europe/comments/nkskhx/ireland_rejects_president_bidens_global_corporate/gzg1yac/,ClashOfTheAsh,1621981786

1889,"A translation for you poor non-Dutch-speaking souls:

&gt;**The federal department of the Interior has been the victim of a far-reaching hacking, in which the intruders had access to the entire computer system. This is a clear case of 'state-sponsored' hacking, most likely by China.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The complexity of the hack makes it difficult to determine exactly what the intruders saw, but it is certain that they had access to virtually all Interior communications and internal data. The intention of the intrusion was to spy on the government department, which is a central link in the governance and security of Belgium. All police services and their databases fall under it, as do the organisation of elections, crisis management, foreign nationals, the issuing of identity cards, and so on. A hack in that place is therefore by definition a serious incident. According to our information, this hack was treated as a 'national crisis' in the cyber emergency plan for the first time, which means that other government departments also had to take extra measures to protect themselves. The Interior department filed a complaint about this with the public prosecutor's office, and an investigating judge was appointed. In the meantime, the leak has been plugged and the infected computer systems have been cleaned up. The federal public prosecutor's office confirms to De Standaard that an investigation is underway.  
&gt;  
&gt;The hack came to light because of the Hafnium affair, in which Chinese hackers penetrated computers via a vulnerability in Exchange, the e-mail system developed by Microsoft. When the affair came to light in early March, it caused a shock in the IT world (DS 9 March). Many organisations, companies and governments use Microsoft Exchange. Whoever has a key to get into such a system has the whole world as his playground.  
&gt;  
&gt;When the Interior department investigated whether the service had fallen prey to such hacking via Exchange, the large-scale break-in was discovered. The first traces go back to the spring of 2019.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Stealing data**  
&gt;  
&gt;According to Microsoft and others, Hafnium is a well-trained and sophisticated group of hackers working out of China. Their original targets, still according to Microsoft, were mainly companies in the United States. With the vulnerability they found in Microsoft Exchange, they can penetrate their target very deeply. ""To start with, they gain access to an Exchange Server with stolen passwords or via vulnerabilities that were not yet known,"" Microsoft communicated. ""They pretend to be someone who can access the server. Then they create a so-called webshell to remotely control the compromised server. Then they use this remote access to steal data from an organisation's network.""  
&gt;  
&gt;All indications are that this technique has also been used against the Interior department, although caution remains with regard to officially attributing it to China as the executor. It is not excluded that a group of hackers connected to another country used the Hafnium techniques to get in. However, the type of attack and the nature of the target mean that this is a serious case of 'state-sponsored hacking', even the worst our country has experienced. Parallels can be drawn with the hacking of Proximus (formerly Belgacom) by the British secret service GCHQ, which became public knowledge in 2013. In that case, the target was not so much the telecom company or the Belgian state itself, but rather the communication that ran worldwide through a Proximus subsidiary. This attack on the Interior department was directed against the service itself. That makes the threat to Belgium as a country greater.

2058,"&gt;Weakening Germany was always in the political interest of the UK and France at the time, which probably also contributed to WW1 breaking out.

It was the only reason tbh. at least for the UK.
And a amoral as well.

Germany was the world second biggest economy pre WW1.

Disclaimer: I hate our monarchy, especially the Hohenzollern.
The Bavarians though are cool.
Judging your monarchy and your past more is something Britain should've done much more.

Attacked is the wrong word, but Britain opposed Germany, because it was against its power.

Germany experienced a great loss after WW1, economically, morally etc. 

No Germany is not respobsible for WW1.
That has long LONG been debunked, but I guess propaganda is still strong.

We unified, you know self-determination.

Which made Britain and France unhappy, Britain and France were countries which fought wars around the world and in Germany for centuries and taking advantages of our heterogene territory.

Germany proceeded to become the second biggest economy in the world -&gt; Britain angry.

Germany wanted colonies to profit from like the UK and France did for centuries(which is bad) -&gt; UK and France angry ""muh power hungry""

Germany said it wanted a navy which is understandable, since there were some good reasons for Germany having one. -&gt; Britain angry ""muh balance of power! Power hungry! Danger to peace!""  which translates to Britain being afraid to lose some power.

Germany becomes isolated, because alliances are made which all oppose Germany.

Germany sticks to Austria, a German brother and traditional close country nothing wrong with that.

Germany and Austria oppose Russian pan slavinism.


When the Archduke got assassinated Austria gave Serbia ultimatum.
Serbia didn't agree.

-&gt; WAR

Russia sticks to Serbia.

Germany sticks to Germany's historical, ethnical, cultural and actual ally Austria.

Both countries(Russia and Germany) didn't need to do so.

France(France wanted a war with Germany since the last 40 decades, because they lost against Germany) and Russia mobilise before Germany.

Kaiser Wilhelm II writes letters to Russia trying to prevent the war.
There is no solution.

Germany fears the two front war against a big colonial power and a country much bigger than itself.

Germany makes a preemtive strike against France.
To get to France it wants to go through Belgium.
The Belgians were having none of it.

France wasn't attacked out of the blue lol.

The was giving Belgium a blank check and used Belgium as an excuse to fight against the German ""threat"".
The UK didn't want Germany to become more powerful and maybe take the Congo and Belgian ports.
You know the Huns should be stopped haha

The UK fights against Germany.
Kaiser Wilhelm II didn't expect that, because he thought there would be respect between cousins.
Belgium was just an excuse.

The only good thing out of WW1 was that the German people were fred from the monarchy, which they did by themselves.

Germany was being painted in a light as 'babaric huns' etc. who were just pure evil.
Which was bullshit of course, especially regarding that Britain did much more evil shit and we were consantly either a war zone or fucked over by the Britain and France.

Did I say we were good in our colonies.
At least we are giving them the stuff back and give Namibia much money.

The Herero and Nama genocide is horrible and was condemed by Germany.

Though pre WW1 Germany and many of the smaller German countries did less evil than pre WW1 UK and France.


Germany is not responsible for WW1 the only reason Britain opposed Germany was Germany's power pre WW1, which Germany lost the decades after.

Look at Germany's power pre WW1 and then in 1950.

Other than the UK, Germany doesn't profit from its former imperialism.",Bavaria (Germany),/r/europe/comments/nkie0z/a_hindenburg_1932_election_poster_decrying/gzemlqs/,Pacreon,1621959151
2059,"&gt; Sounds like you present it as a positive? 

It is a positive. In terms of GDP, imports count negatively and exports count positively. So the fact that the UK's trade deficit has fallen (i.e. imports fell by more than exports) means that UK GDP will rise as a result.

There are second order effects (i.e. the churn of goods within the economy and associated activity) which will be negative, but on the face of it the latest post-Brexit trade data is supportive for GDP growth. 

As the trade deficit comes down (i.e. trade balance becomes less negative), per capita GDP in the UK will go up and per capita GDP in the EU will go down. The quantities will be pretty negligible though. 

It's interesting because most people expected UK-&gt;EU exports to be impacted more than EU-&gt;UK exports, but that is not what has happened so far. Even more confusing is that the UK has waived a lot of trade frictions for the first year or so, whereas the EU imposed them immediately (so all goods going from UK to EU have to have forms and checks), that by itself should mean that UK exports are harder hit than its imports.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/nko4yl/uk_trade_with_the_eu_falls_by_more_than_a_fifth/gzemlrp/,MyFavouriteAxe,1621959151

Hijacking, in fact, refers to a specifically criminal act. 
Another analogy, easy for you to understand, I hope, is that we don‚Äôt call it theft when a government seizes goods at customs. Or when a government taxes you. Governments have the authority to do things that private individuals do not. Grounding flights over their airspace is one of those things. Aircraft, in fact, have a legal obligation to obey orders to land or redirect from the country over which they fly. As happened in the US, as happened in Belarus. So no, it is not reasonable to call it hijacking, even though you really want to because you know that if you described what happened without using hyperbolic language the whole thing would appear really mundane.",,/r/europe/comments/nkinum/eu_locks_out_belarus_from_international_aviation/gzemna7/,General_Queipo,1621959170

2106,"Now read the report carefully on the Bolivian jet. They had enough fuel to reach their destination, they choose to land and take fuel on board out of precaution. They had the option to just fly over international waters. They landed because they knew there was no one board. Political fallout was definetely in favor of Bolivia. No one reported a bomb threat, no one got a fighter jet to force the plain down under the thread of shooting it down. They had options. They could have made it to Bolivia with no stops. And countries denied the entry because they did not want to deal with USA over this issue and unnedlesly straining relations with Bolivia. Again, this also was not a general aviation passenger airliner - this was a diplomatic plane that has different rules around it.

Now, compare that to the current events. There was a fake bomb threat. They intercepted the airliner by force. They, for all intents and purposes, kidnapped all the passengers. And they arrested someone who had official political asylum in EU. And all for an airliner that is out of their jurisdiction and they had no rights to touch. 

AGAIN. The consequences of not reacting over this specific incident are dire. If countries like Russia, China and others see that they can do this and not much will happen, the general aviation will go to shit. And your personal ability to air travel internationally has a high chance to be affected. Long haul flights relly on flying over a bunch of countries who could and can have reasons to pull the same crap. Can you even imagine the consequences of this, if it's not nipped in the bud?

THERE ARE NO TREATIES FOR THE RIGHT OF ACCESS FOR PRIVATE AND STATE OWNED AVIATION. YOU ARE REQUIRED TO RECEIVE PERMISSION TO ENTER EVERY COUNTRIES AIRSPACE. THERE WAS NOTHING TO BREAK THERE. IT WAS PURE POLITICAL GAME AND IT HAD ZERO EFFECT ON AVIATION.

&gt;The ENTENTE was also responsible for the escalation of the conflict. France and Russia both mobilized before germany did.

Russia mobilized because they guaranteed Serbia's independence, Austria was well aware of this. Germany was the one that decided to disproportionately respond to mobilization with a dual declaration of war, pretty much instantly transforming what could have been a Balkan conflict into a European conflict.

Let's also again not forget that Austria were the ones pushing for this nonsense in the first place, despite Serbia conceding to all but one of their demands.

And, might I add, our sanctions are always disproportionate. We always err towards the absolute minimum lower bound, because we fear escalation. Our opponents know we fear escalation, and as a result know that they can escalate things to their comfort without it getting out of control.

We are basically perfect puppets to be played.

2287,"&gt; It's just that science easiest undertood if you can accurately predict the future, like hale's comet which we can predict decades into the future (unless an unaccounted for event happens).

Sure, but all you're saying here is that easier problems are easier; this says nothing about science as a method or 'institution' nor the trustworthiness of scientists, but rather the difficulty of the problem.

To try and make this clearer: the governing equations of wind flow are sorted. But the system of equations contains more variables than there are equations, and thus can't be analytically solved. If I had perfect knowledge of some of these variables in advance, I could perfectly forecast the remaining ones. But perfect here means *perfect* - like omniscient God-like. And because that is and forever will be impossible, we have to use other methods, which reduce the skill of our forecast as the system is chaotic.

When Lorenz developed chaos theory, he found that losing a few decimal places in his model input conditions led to radically different outcomes pretty quickly. E.g. he had 2.141678 as a wind velocity, but if he used 2.141000 the forecast diverged. You would need observations over the entire 3-dimensional atmosphere at a precision beyond our best instruments to accomplish anything close to what you're suggesting. This is *so much more complicated than the orbit of Halley's comet*.

&gt;Out of curiosity how often do for instance volcanic activities cause the need for adapting predictions in that area or elsewhere?

I'm less familiar with this but exceptionally large volcanoes show up in climate modelling. They can definitely be massive and un-forecasted forcings, but I think their time horizon is on the order of 2-3 years, so not the primary factor.

&gt;which is why I believe we couldn't accurately forecast the weather before we could understand the higher layers of the atmosphere.

I'm probably biased given my background in surface- and boundary-layer meteorology, but all of our weather occurs in the lowest layers of the atmosphere and while understanding what happens in the upper layers is obviously vital, I would argue the heat and moisture fluxes and flows in the lowest layers are more important for weather, but it depends on your forecast horizon.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/nkinum/eu_locks_out_belarus_from_international_aviation/gzdsrqv/,ShootTheChicken,1621944875

Your post had me thinking, but no, I wouldn't say that. 

I would say that the members of parliament was elected. And then they point to a person to form the government. That person has the majority backing him/her - or at least not the majority voting against. 

If a party has a good election and wins more seats, they usually try to leverage the popularity into more influence over the government.

You were confused who's currently in government, and your illegible comment seemed like you were claiming Syriza was scaling things up.

If you're now implying that *ND* is scaling things up, you're wrong about that too.  Greece doesn't start anything; only responds. What did ND start? *Defense*?

Again, with your false equivalents.  I know that you *want* to believe the things you're saying, because you sympathize with Turkey, but even you can't admit that Ankara is in the right. So you're clutching at straws to make a false equivalent between Turkey's neighborhood policy, and Greece's defensive responses.

2576,"It's an official language in Ireland and Malta. But it's also the lingua franca of the European Union itself, and the institutions. The [sole working language of the ECB](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/careers/faq/html/index.en.html) for example, is English. You can't apply to work there if you don't speak English.

That's particular to the ECB, that it's their official position, they *only* accept English. Most agencies aren't so straight about it, in theory you might be able to apply speaking two or three other EU languages that aren't English but *in practice* it's usually English.

I worked for an EU agency in a non-English speaking country and the working language was English. That was the reality, it was not anything else. The only people there who even tried to push using another language were the French, they would make an extra effort to try to ensure that things were translated into and published in French. They spoke English fine as well, but it was notable that they would make a personal effort to get stuff put into French as well. Everyone else, from whichever of the 27 countries, just spoke English and showed little interest in anything else.

The EU parliament is another example, although MEPs may use whichever language they like, the [most common language spoken is English](https://www.theguardian.com/education/datablog/2014/may/21/european-parliament-english-language-official-debates-data). This isn't from native speakers, it's because people from non-English speaking countries choose to use English in a European context.

&gt;""Although MEPs can speak in their native language, many will opt to speak in English,"" says Harry Cooper, parliamentary adviser to MEP Syed Kamall. ""But the data speaks for itself, English is Europe's common language in much the same way Latin once was.""

&gt;Olga Cosmidou, director-general for interpretation and conferences in the European parliament, says the reason English is so widely spoken in the plenary debates is because the European Commission representatives all speak in English. The bulk of the talking in parliament is on legislative issues and these are always put forward by the commissioners in English and often the ensuing discussing between the commission and MEPs will be in English.

&gt;""This is either because the commissioner has used English, or because the whole [legislative] file prepared by the commission was in English, which induces them to speak English.""

&gt;While the parliament recognises all 24 languages, the commission only has three working languages: English, French and German.

&gt;Cosmidou says: ""If the commissioners have urgent papers or they don't manage to translate, or their collaborators are not of the same nationality and the common language between them and the commissioner is English, the papers are prepared in English. And the commissioners find it easier to speak in the language in which they have have their papers prepared.""

As noted, it's also overwhelmingly the language used by the EU commission.

&gt;In 2015, the EU commission had more than 1.6 million pages translated into English, compared with 72,662 pages in French.

It still depends a lot on your contributions though and you get a yearly notification of the monthly pension payments that you can expect if you continue to earn like you currently do. If you die early parts of your payments can go to your ex-wife (widow).

In contrast, in for example Switzerland the public pension is more like a bank account where each individual's contributions is tracked, your monthly payments depend directly on your contributions and afaik you can choose a lump-sum payment when retiring.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, what you propose ('invade another country to kidnap a citizen and then exchange them for another citizen') is more than enough to be considered an act of war.

Since the EU has no military treaties going on (outside of perhaps a line about members keeping their own country safe), armies and agents can't just move across Europe, so who has to do the kidnapping?

Because whomever it is would find themselves flooded with Russians in no time whatsoever.

2810,"Seen this somewhere else and I think it sums up the situation perfectly. For the record I don't support authoritarianism of any sort but this whole farce of a narrative in the media needs to be called out for what it is:

The US doesn‚Äôt care what type of government a country has so long as they play ball economically and geopolitically. This is how the US can fund and defend Israel, Saudi Arabia, Pinochet‚Äôs Chile. They don‚Äôt care whether Lukashenka‚Äôs a dictator or not. All they care about is whether the Belarusian government bends the knee, so to speak. Lukashenka does not. There are multiple legitimate criticisms and concerns about him that I share, too. But for 30 years, Belarus has retained much of the public infrastructure of the soviet era. Public healthcare, housing, education and strong trade unions are reasons why many Belarusians support him. They‚Äôve seen the destruction the mass privatisation that occurred upon the fall of the USSR brought in Russia and elsewhere. The 90s were hell on Earth for citizens of former soviet republics as private capitalists picked the carcass of soviet life. Masters educated women had to sell their bodies to feed their children. Pensions, housing, jobs, healthcare coverage disappeared overnight. Many have referred to a collective PTSD among that generation of former soviet citizens. They feel Lukashenka‚Äôs government has saved them from this suffering due to the amount of the economy that has remained publicly owned. 

The opposition against him have proclaimed their revolution is for private property, landlords, economic liberalism, not the cause of the average working person. 

There are legitimate issues with Lukashenka, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the alternative would be that much better. There‚Äôs a real fear among Belarusians that regime change would cause a similar crash and descent towards reactionary liberalism we‚Äôve seen in Poland and Ukraine in recent years. 

But the US doesn‚Äôt care about that. They care about the potential for profit of those publicly owned organisations and infrastructure if only they were privatised. Also, they‚Äôd get another ally next to Putin.

Again, there are real concerns, but those concerns are not why the US cares. It‚Äôs a big game of chess between the US and Russia. 

I hope I‚Äôve been fair and balanced, because it‚Äôs a very difficult situation.",,/r/europe/comments/njwlpz/latvia_is_removing_the_lukashenko_era_belarus/gzc21kh/,xFatSnacks,1621901365

2814,"I would agree with that assessment now but you have to remember at the time the UK was coming out of serious economic difficulty.  

The UK had spent the previous 20 years trying to convince the islanders to swap to Argentina, including in 1980 when it tried to do a leaseback scheme.

Also Argentina thought they could convince the UN that the UK was the aggressor because we threatened to remove some people that flew a flag.

Turns out our diplomats were better and Russia didn't veto the UK action for some reason.  Also a new priminister that could do with a popularity spike was happy to fight back, maybe unexpectedly.

Europe was not uniform behind the UK.  France certainly was a strong military ally, Spain had links to South America and Ireland tried to stop EEC economic sanctions.

South Africa wouldn't let the UK use their ports (lapsed agreement so no reason).  Most of South America (particularly Peru), Russia, Israel, Libia supported Argentina with weapons.  

US didn't want war that could be used by Russia at first, (most) Europe supported UK, Chili was worried about Argentina doing same to them and other countries helped with logistics.

&gt;at a certain lvl indeed, to act like you are a normal plane, to hide, but if it's too small it's stupid, same goes with ship, you want to act like a fishing boat, a zodiac in middle of the sea is more suspicious than anything.

That's not how aircraft stealth works. You're not pretending to be a smaller flying thing. You're avoiding being seen the way you can't see black writing on a black background. It's below the threshold of detection of the radar at that range.

&gt; And yes passive stealth has been showed to be useless against modern army, even Israel hide their f35 behind civilian plane or outside Syrian frontier to strike 

The first thing has not happened and the second thing doesn't say the jet involved is an F-35. Also the point of stealth isn't being totally invisible the entire time. If your enemy has an advanced air defense batteries the point is being able to do missions closer to them or getting close enough to find and kill them. 

&gt;which Isra√´l didn't even try to deny (https://twitter.com/IDF/status/919859742180339712),

It shot at an F-15C and then F-16s destroyed the battery. They had 5 F-35s at that point compared to 200 F-15s and F-16s. The F-35 wasn't even used in combat until 2018.

Also the S300 and S400 batteries in Syria are only ~50km from the Lebanon border. That's not exactly far in terms of air combat.

&gt;(well they also said birds damaged the plane but let's say it's true https://www.kan.org.il/item/?itemId=23623).

https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2019/05/17/this-is-how-1500-plus-aircraft-bird-strikes-have-affected-the-marine-corps-in-the-past-15-years/

Bird strikes ain't exactly rare.

&gt;Jet engine exhaust is up to 2000... [turbine cracking discussion]

You're conflating the temperature in the high temperature turbine inside the engine with the exhaust temperature. As the gasses expand and mix with bypass air their temperature drops down.

&gt;and most can be seen at 400k with new IRS 

Not true. Too much atmospheric attenuation. 

&gt; cameras even behind clouds,

Plainly impossible. IRSTs operate in the 3-5um range which is not long enough to ignore atmospheric particles including the droplets in clouds. Any cloud you couldn't see through in visible light would be roughly as impenetrable in the 3-5um range.

&gt;(which is how modern army spot naval group from infrared thanks to satelites nowadays)

I think generally ship tracking is done via ELINT and synthetic aperture radar though optical surveillance satellites do provide some extra information I think those are using visible and near infrared instead of mid band infrared like IRST systems. 

Also the amount of air you travel through you travel through from space to sea level is actually pretty small. It's the equivalent of 14 miles of air at 30,000 feet.

&gt; meteor missile had been tested and was able to lock alone on imitation of jet engine at 200kms but ok.

I probably shouldn't have put this much effort into a post for someone who thinks the meteor missile is infrared guided... Here is a hint if the front of the air to air missile is [pointy and opaque it's radar guided](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/ILA_2008_PD_446.JPG), if it's [round and glassy it's IR guided.

invaded in Ukraine? you mean Crimea where are most people is ethnically russians who choose to repatriate and not to live under the rule of nazis who burn people alive like it happened in Odessa? Have you heard about The right of the people to self determination?   
invasion in Georgia you say? its when georgian troops attacted russian peacekeepers and commited a literal genocide of osetian people? i bet you never seen a videos of georgian tank in Osetia's town Tshinval shooting in windows for fun. fox news wouldn't show this for sure. here is the fact - Georgia started aggression towards Osetia and Abkhazia, killed dozens of civilians. after that Russia reacted. you know that happened next. western countrys blamed Russia. but try to think for yourself. whats the point for Russia to invade in Georgia, what is the benefit in making an enemy on its own border? Russia has a lot of resources, Georgia has none. none resources, none production, none strategical position. Russia took under control the air, sea ports and roads, forced georgian authorities to conduct negotiations and invited president of France. as a result fighting was stopped. it was real goal and after that russian troops just left. also you speaking about Putin but in 2008 he wasn't even in charge. if you need someone to blame it is ex-president of Georgia - Saakashvili. he was recruited by american intelligence services and trained to act in interests of america now he is wanted in Georgia for murder and corruption.  
assasinations? the man who was killed in London before leaving Russia was inprisoned. If russian authorities wanted him to be dead he would be killed quietly in his cell without any problems and attention. Again whats the point to let him go in England and kill him with some freaking super rare radioactive poison?   
the other dude - Skripal as they say was poisoned by Novichok. he survived. but here is the thing Novichok is an chemical warfare agent of mass destruction. if it was true he would be dead, and his family, and the half of his neighbourhood also. interesting fact all this assassinations is in England. pretty sus.  


troops on the European border. did you know what Russia is a part of Europe and border of Europe is located in the middle of Russia? its called Ural Mountains. but if you talking about russian troops on the south firtsable try to understand its a russian land and we can move our troops as we consider it necessary for our safety. second - it was a reaction for the agressive actions of ukranian troops in the eastern ukraine which is on our border!  


Navalny is a racist pro-nazi scum. he was detained because he had two(!) suspended sentences. he was send to Germany for medical treatment, and after leaving the hospital he stayed there for half of the year which is a violation of russian law. he putted himself in this situation.  


Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. it happened in zone of war conflict in Eastern Ukraine. there is a civil war between pro-nazi ukranian government and the people of Eastern Ukraine. Russia is not even a side in this conflict. there is no russian troops. there is no russian forces. blaming Russia for this accident is pure propaganda forced by western media. you should ask why ukranian air services not closed the air and why they send the plane in this region, usually it flied above the Black sea.  


don't trust the media, check the facts and try to use a critical thinking. Russians have seen a lot of horrible things and believe me a war and death it is a last things what russians wants to have on their borders.

3003,"&gt;Do you really believe this? You really think in the next 2000 yearsEurope's borders are not going to change at all, and that we'll live insome kind of magical peace that will last forever? I highly doubt itconsidering how much the borders changed over the last 2000 years, shit even the last 300 years.

I- I am honestly dumbfounded by the level of your stupidity. I was talking about **continental** borders, not national borders. **Europe's eastern frontier has been delimited by the Ural Mountains in Russia since at least 500-600 centuries** by now I think... how do continental borders of Europe change? Huh? You just draw a random line in a country, just cause they wanna join an organization. Are you a toddler?

National borders of Europe have changed countless times even in the last 100 years. Crimea recently got annexed by Russia. And obviously, more changes to the map can happen.. obviously in the east, where Belarus might unify with Russia, and eastern Ukraine can also join Russia, even though the chances of that are thin.

&gt;And yes, I draw my line at the European aligned Ukranians.

So your point is that whoever wants to join EU, an organization, is a part of the continent or whatever, and whoever doesn't is not a part of Europe?

""It's immoral"" -&gt; According to who? You are free to never engage in such acts if you really feel bad about them. But what other people do concerns only themselves. I don't like how people abuse alcohol and tobacco and I don't ask my government to ban it.

Outgoing Prime Minister Rutte calls on airline company KLM to avoid the airspace over Belarus. Rutte emphasized that airlines cannot be prohibited from flying over Belarus, but said he would like to insist on it. Earlier, KLM said it would continue to fly over Belarus. KLM will respond shortly, the company told NOS.

Ahead of tonight's European summit on the arrest of blogger and journalist Roman Protasevich in Belarus, calls for diplomatic measures against the Lukashenko government are growing louder. Countries are outraged over the forced landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk after a false bomb threat, after which the journalist was detained.

Shortly before the summit meeting, Rutte said Belarus' action goes beyond all limits and must have consequences. ""Saying that there is a bomb on board to land an aircraft is life-threatening,"" he said. He calls for an investigation. In addition to insisting on avoiding Belarusian airspace, he wants European sanctions against all those involved in Belarus.

Even before the summit in Brussels could begin, things got tough in diplomatic circles. Latvia and Belarus expelled each other's ambassadors and other diplomats. Lithuanian President Nauseda also suggested on camera that a closure of European airspace and the extension of sanctions against Belarus were on the table tonight.

**'Abduction'**

""An abduction"" for which Belarus must be held accountable, the Italian Foreign Ministry wrote this afternoon about the journalist's arrest. ""This transgression cannot be without consequences,"" thinks the German foreign minister, Maas. Chancellor Merkel also says Protasevich should be released immediately.

Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, speaks of an ""international scandal"" and lets it be known that sanctions will be on the agenda at least at the EU summit. ""I hope we can take decisions tonight,"" Michel said.

The European Commission, through President Von der Leyen, already condemned the ""hijacking"" of the Ryanair plane and the arrest of the journalist yesterday, as did many European leaders. Today the commission speaks of ""an obvious attempt to silence all opposition voices in the country.""

Von der Leyen wants to freeze 3 billion euros of European investment in Belarus ""until Belarus is democratic."" She also wants to see talks on sanctions against individuals, companies and organizations that fund the Belarusian regime. Rutte also suggested these kinds of sanctions prior to the summit.

**Flight bans**

There was also a shocked reaction outside the European Union. ""Lukashenko's regime must be held accountable for such reckless and dangerous behavior,"" believes British Foreign Secretary Raab. ""What is now being reported is a shocking attack on civil aviation and on international law. It also poses a great danger to civilian flights everywhere.""

Raab has also summoned the Belarusian ambassador and informed him that aircraft belonging to the Belarusian airline Belavia are no longer welcome in the country. Furthermore, British aircraft are advised for the time being to avoid Belarusian airspace for the safety of passengers. Ukraine also wants to completely suspend air traffic to and from Belarus.

The White House reports that President Biden has also been updated on the arrest of the journalist. US Secretary of State Blinken called for his release yesterday.

**'Lukashenko to Sochi'**

Meanwhile, the Russian newspaper Kommersant reports that Belarusian President Lukashenko will go to Russia on Friday for a meeting with President Putin. The two will meet in Sochi. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov says that what happened needs to be carefully sorted out and believes there is no rush to come up with a response.",,/r/europe/comments/nk48t8/dutch_pm_rutte_calls_on_klm_airlines_to_stop/gzas5fs/,CardboardElite,1621879828

3168,"On 2, in regards to secret service, you can never know but at a population of cca. 80 milion I can assure you that Germany, in regards to secret assassinations, from let's say 2000, has carried quite a lot. That's the power play every state does to mantain control and avoid possible chaos( spies, diplomats, business men, terrorists etc). It happens here quite often as well. Regarding Poland, I was implying that there's the sentiment that the Germans had before WW2, of getting the land inhabited by their own population. I don't think the state should be having a monopoly on education, but I do think that European state funded education is the best (whether directly or indirectly). Shouldn't I be concerned who were the people that formed the political elite in my country and in Europe? I think I should.

On 1, even with NATO, the constant fear they're pushing onto people is not organic but rather media driven, I feel safer here in Eastern Europe than I felt visiting France, Italy or Spain. 

On 6, indeed, so why not make the parliament (which was directly elected by the people) the sole legislator? Why do you need the council and the comission in regards to enacting legislation? I don't think that's a true democracy in the senes that we know it. 

On 7, why not create a body that elects judges based on an exam(with certain criteria)? And why not create a specialized school to form the very best? It would increase the value of jurisprudence in that area.  There are many improvements to be made to create a meritocratic system. 

On 8, sure but let's not forget that law is subjective and can be interpreted in various ways. When fairness is being dictated by the interpretators of the law (which have an allegiance towards the EU) I don't really find it fair, but hey, that's my opinion.

On 3, what I'm more concerned is about monopolies. Tax evasion can be a problem as well, but when huge foreign corporations can saturate the market to the detriment of the local populace, that's where I've got zero tolerance.

On 5, well it was envisioned as just being a market. If it was just that, I'd be fine with it. But I certainly don't like the way it changes citizenship law or border security.

On 4, GDP isn't really a good metric but it is the best we have, but I don't think that renouncing sovereignity for comodity is a balanced road to be taken.

I do admit that I buy from the supermarket, but I buy the made in Romania brand, that incentives the shop to buy local. ( but that has been demonized by the EU because certain people can't have complete monopoly no more, fuck them in their rich urban lobbying assholes ). 

Romania has been through communism. We have seen how bad it can get, because we lived it. Free market and protectionist policies are very important to not cause famines ( see history ). It's better to have an overabundance of food, and keep the population fed in comparison to the alternative. 

You will hit a brick wall when you pitch : a stand that it's 100% local to a supermarket.

Also, to add. We still have food markets with local products. Tastier, fresh, and a tomato tastes like a tomato. Not plastic, rubber or stylophome. But that requires that the farmer knows his land, practices no pesticides farming and, in case shit, he has liquidity to rely on.

3377,"&gt; Vote counts, lobbying, expenses, decision making.. The EP is not great across most of that by any standard and various member states do far, far better. The EU institutionally and the EP itself is not particularly transparent.

That's still pretty vague, and moreover, the same practices exist at the nationa level and nobody minds. I do of course think that the EP ought to be elevated to the highest standards in the EU, and as such its a good opportunity to increase all standards of accountability.

&gt;Firstly that simply isn't true and...

In the ordinary legislative procedure it is. There is the exceptional consultative procedure, but that is the exception rather than the rule now, and the court tends to interprete it in favor of maximum influence of the EP rather than a formality. Then some decisions are the prerogative of the Commission, but that's not different from what other executive organs in member states have.

&gt;It is the deliberately imposed limitations, but they effectively fracture the power structure. Yes, there is something akin to an executive, the courts and then the Parliament, but the design and where power sits and where member states have influence (vs an EU electorate) are all pretty important points.

Of course, but the basic structure exists.

&gt;No.. The difference here is that the party, or parties that you might vote for that are part of S&amp;D or the EPP in Spain are presenting very different potions when compared to those who are part of S&amp;D or the EPP in Germany or Poland, or indeed France (if you consider LR). They are very broad umbrellas and people are voting for national parties.

The CDU and CSU also have different positions on issues. And other parties do have to compromise between their regional branches too, even when they aren't formally a conglomerate of regional parties. This is more a matter of presentation than content.

An improvement, actually, in comparison to a unitary party. If regional groups disagree with the party leadership it's easier for them to join another group. This ultimately increases the stability of the system.

&gt;Depends on the country. That said, my point would be that at a national level you tend to find all the elements that exist within the EU, but generally in isolation. The EP in that context is relatively weak, there are other weak parliaments within EU member states of course, but they generally see more accountability and direct democratic involvement in the other bits of government.

And my point is that this is a deliberate choice rather than something inevitable and unchangeable baked into the institutions.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/ngu5ut/polish_schools_will_teach_that_eu_is_unlawful/gz9wh90/,silverionmox,1621865718

3428,"&gt;True. It's not the same. I do agree the bomb threat made it more difficult for the Ryanair jet.

Also the fighter escort and being made to land at Belarus which was actually further away than their destination. 

&gt;At the same time, increasing risks for a head of state, surely that must count for something a bit ... you know ... more.

I disagree, I would say risking civilians is worse and generally there are more people and therefore lives at stake on a civilian aircraft. Though this gets into moral grounds about if some lives are worth more than others and so on.

&gt;At the same time, let's assume Ben Laden is flying in Air Afghanistan across the US without landing. I highly doubt the US would be powerless to do anything.

Well they would probably shoot it down long before it reached US airspace. I doubt they would want to take a chance with that for obvious reasons.

But when it comes to legality I have no idea. When you agree to let a state aircraft enter is it with the concept that it can be revoked at any time? Do you agree on rules about this? If it is revoked then what ? If you make an agreement to let them enter but then while they are on the way you revoke it is that allowed or do you have to respect the agreement when the flight is on the way?

Laypeople who like cats and dogs (those *not* involved in animal rights NGOs) feel like sterilisation is a form of animal abuse and that all animals have a fundamental right to reproduce. It's a bit of anthropomorphism, because cats and dogs are seen as metaphysically closer to humans and there's a strong religious taboo against both abortions and sterilisation when it comes to humans.  

Most people with pets wouldn't accept sterilising their pet if it doesn't reproduce at least once.

3615,"&gt; Not about the topic but I went to those islands and Greeks who left after Cyprus crisis were coming back and even their school was now open. So it was nice to see people together. But that was like 8 years ago.

It is a sensitive issue because the Turkish state has already violated much of the Treaty of these islands. The Civil Law of 1927 revoked Greek rights and later on with the Eritme Programmi and settlement of the islands from Anatolia, the issue got even worse. After 2015 there was much pressure on Turkey from the international community because the Greek minority was getting erased step by step so the school you talk about were established. 

&gt; in Turkish media there were reports about Greece claiming more water in Ege sea from 6 to 12 mile to be exact, Turkish authorities claimed such distance in a sea like Ege is disproportional (unlike an open sea or ocean) and cannot be made. So what is the reason behind that?

12 nautical miles is the international standards all nations enjoy. Turkey too. Turkey claims that 12 nautical miles would ""block"" Turkey but the reality is that is just rhetoric as there are provisions about this already in law. Specifically, Turkey, even with 12-nm will still have a connective corridor between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean and safe and innocent passage of Turkish ships will be guaranteed exactly as it is now. 

Disproportional is mostly rhetoric. I am pretty sure you are aware of Cavusoglu going around in interviews showing some maps. Those maps don't have a legal basis but serve to create impressions. The Greek equivalent would be for the Greek foreign minister to go on an interview saying ""here is are anadolu vatani dogma. Look at how much Anatolia Turkey has. It is disproportional and we need to safeguard our rights there"". I am pretty sure you understand how that would be ridiculous. 

What Turkey asks for is basically for Greek to reject what every other nation on the planet enjoys and Turkey to get more than what every other nation on the planet has the right to have. ""What's mine is mine and what's your is negotiable"". This is why Turkey is isolated on the issue. This wasn't the case though back in the day. It is impossible to find such Turkish claims earlier on. It is a modern chauvinistic invention. 

&gt; if two pieces of land in this case Anatolia and Greek islands are closer to each other than lets say 3x miles and coastal water by int law is 2x, then what happens?

These cases are again defined by Treaties. Take for example the Ayvalik Islands or the Foca Islands. Less than 3 nm from the Turkish coast. 

&gt; Also can Turkish ships, obv except war ships, go through between Greek islands freely or to what extend? Is it completely bound to Greece or ships with some properties can go or is it completely free?

The word Jew comes from Judea, the ancestral land of these people. Jews lived there always and the second world war made it clear why Jews should have their own country.  They accepted the partition offer by the Brits, which Arabs rejected. It led to Israel's independence war in 48'.

3751,"&gt; Sure you can argue that Turkey has access to Black Sea, but Black Sea only pours into Aegean and thus Mediterranean making it a non factor, if a degree of control isn't reached in Aegean and East Med

The thing is though that even with the international standard of 12 nautical miles Turkey *still* has access to the Mediterranean Sea and a connecting corridor from it to the Black Sea. That's a non issue but Turkey brings it up for rhetoric. Have you seen Cavusoglu showcasing his maps at interviews? They are legaly and logically baseless but he needs to win over the propaganda game and the minds of people who don't have expert knowledge on the issue. 

The only actual issue between the two countries is the delimitation of territorial waters (which is not the same as EEZ so that we are specific). 

&gt; implementing UNCLOS EEZ always has been a challenge throughout the world, leading to major disputes. In such cases UNCLOS advises that disputes should be solved through bilateral agreements under the principle of fairness, effectively agreeing on a delimitation agreement

The only major EEZ dispute has been the South China Sea one. And China, as most nations on this planet (including the US - which has not ratified but is a member which accepts it and enacts it as customary law), is a part of the UNCLOS. What you see though is China defying the law and thus we have the problems that exist there. 

To the Greco-Turkish matter now. Turkey's claims (modern Turkey's claims to be specific - this issue did not exist back in the day), that is the extreme position of land not having EEZ because it is in a form of an island (shouldn't New Zealand/Cuba/Britain have an EEZ?), results in problem only from the point of view that accepts the notion that islands don't have EEZ. Which is a position only Turkey takes further isolating itself from the international community. What Turkey does is to ask Greece to give up what all nations on this planet enjoy just so that Turkey can have more of what the rest of the nations have the legal right to have. What Turkey says is ""what's mine is mine, what's yours is negotiable"". 

To add to that, EEZ delimitation and territorial waters as defined by international law already have the provisions needed in place for every issue that Turkey raises.

The Russian play would be: foreseeable EU sanctions on Belarus drive Minsk closer to Moscow.

3813,"The Kingdom of Greece (Greek: ŒíŒ±œÉŒØŒªŒµŒπŒøŒΩ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ºôŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ) was established in 1832 and was the successor state to the First Hellenic Republic. It was internationally recognised by the Treaty of Constantinople, where Greece also secured its full independence from the Ottoman Empire after nearly four centuries.

In 1831, the assassination of the first Governor of Greece, Count Ioannis Kapodistrias, created political and social instability that endangered the country's relationship with its allies. To avoid escalation and in order to strengthen Greece's ties with the Great Powers, Greece agreed to become a Kingdom in 1832; see [Treaty of London (1832)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Conference_of_1832).

Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was initially the first candidate for the Greek throne; however, he turned down the offer. Otto of Wittelsbach, Prince of Bavaria was chosen as its first King. Otto arrived at the provisional capital, Nafplion, in 1833 aboard a British warship.

The Kingdom of Greece was dissolved in 1924 and the Second Hellenic Republic was established following Greece's defeat by Turkey in the Asia Minor Campaign. A military coup d'√©tat restored the monarchy in 1935 and Greece became a Kingdom again until 1973.

The Kingdom was finally dissolved in the aftermath of a seven-year military dictatorship (1967‚Äì1974) and the Third Hellenic Republic was established following a referendum held in 1974.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/njpcb0/24_may_1832_the_first_kingdom_of_greece_is/gz8mqtz/,filosoful,1621830128

Army nurses can be deployed but they work in a medical setting that are less military styled than most military positions.

We joke often in Serbia that if we were to send the trashiest turbo-folk song that we would kill it and receive 12 points from all the Balkans.

From the point of view of many of its members, it is the same as with Czechia and Slovakia. It is just a platform, where they overpromise, then underdeliver.   
I honestly googled and I am not sure what our membership gave us besides an opportunity for some minor politicians to impotently jerk off over how much business they for sure will bring to us in the future.

4155,"&gt; And to what criticism is this poster response to exactly? Why are people calling it ""whataboutism"" if they don't know the answer to that question?

I couldn't tell you what criticism this poster is in response too, considering that I can find nearly nothing about this poster when I reverse search it... I'm not entirely sure it's even genuine, but I'm not trying to make a definite statement there. And I'm certainly not trying to defend some of the other points in this comment thread. My understanding of whataboutisms in response to criticism with this propaganda is from the comment up above.

&gt; Certain Russian nationalists still sometimes spew it out whenver they can't think of another rebuttal to criticism of their ''perfect'' state that never did anything wrong of course.

If a similar talking point is a clear example of a whataboutism, it's not hard to make the inference that propaganda posters expressing that talking point are intended to do the same. Which would probably explain some of the comments here, but I'm not in people's heads.

&gt; But whatabautism is only used when it benefits USA. A simply look at the wikipedia article will tell you that it's used exclusively for fighting criticism of the USA.

I would disagree. I see several examples under the ""Prominent Usage"" tab of the Wikipedia page for whataboutism that don't serve to benefit the United States. It mentions Northern Ireland and the Troubles, which is unrelated to the United States. (In fact, [this article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-roots-of-the-what-about-ploy-1497019827) cites the origins of ""whataboutery"" as comjng from the Troubles.) It mentions Turkish politics, which would not primarily revolve around America. And it even mentions American politics as often engaging in whataboutism, particularly through Trumpism. Also, according to that Wikipedia page, Edward Lucas coined the phrase ""whataboutism"" in [this article](https://www.edwardlucas.com/2007/10/29/diary-day-one/). Not every example provided their deals with the United States, such as deflecting to South African blacks when asked about Soviet Jews.

And even if it really was only used to block against criticism of the United States, that doesn't actually make an argument for why whataboutisms should be accepted. If anything, the only point that makes is that more people should be calling out whataboutisms, because it's a still an invalid response to criticism.",,/r/europe/comments/nj0gco/american_freedom_soviet_propaganda_poster_1960s/gz7jx75/,Sheyren,1621808051

If as you say the struggle of black success is relevant then why write your deleted comment at all? Or did the racism just jump out in that moment? If you are not well versed on American history I can suggest some relevant reading. Then you pivoted into how Russia was directly responsible for the rise of the BLM movement I corrected you and now you are trying to play it off with whataboutism. 

Your views that racial justice is the west is simply a sore spot and that outside actors are stoking the fires are entirely wrong because it negates the fact that the history of the racial justice movement in America has spanned about the length of the existence of black people in America. 

Every generation of black people in this country has had to fight for rights, from slave rebellions down to the BLM protests today.

&gt;we were the first country IN THE WORLD to allow gays to marry

*That* was out of left field, but it's funny you should mention that. Setting aside the Ancient Romans that had very lavish and public marriages with men, the people in Egypt and the Levant that the Bible complained about, the examples Heian Japan and in XVIIIth century China... [etc, etc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_same-sex_unions), and more informal ""tolerated"" cases like the so-called [Boston Marriages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_marriage) (see r/SapphoAndHerFriend and the example below)

&gt;[1807](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19th_century_in_LGBT_rights) - One of the early known same-sex couples in American history, Vermont residents Charity Bryant and Sylvia Drake, begin their relationship.[2] This couple is most strongly documented in historian Rachel Hope Cleves' 2014 book Charity and Sylvia: A Same-Sex Marriage in Early America.[2]

The first modern example of a State allowing gay marriages, without explicitly writing new laws for them but simply by removing the pre-existing ban, was

&gt;[In November 1917, after the October Revolution, the Tsarist criminal code was abrogated by the Bolsheviks, **thus legalizing same-sex sexual intercourse between consenting adults in the Russian SSR and the later Ukrainian SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_and_LGBT_rights#Soviet_Union). The Bolsheviks took an official position at this time that homosexuality was not of harm and was more a scientific concern than a legal concern.[7]** Like a lot of wonderful initiatives in the USSR didn't last very many years. However, if we want to make this into a ""competition"", the record for ""a modern government allowing gay marriage"" is theirs.

&gt;[1975](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_LGBT_history,_20th_century) - Clela Rorex, a clerk in Boulder County, Colorado, issues the first same-sex marriage licenses in the United States, issuing the very first of them to Dave McCord and Dave Zamora, on 26 March 1975.[100] Six same-sex marriages were performed as a result of her giving out licenses, but all of the marriages were overturned later that year.[100]

&gt;1986 -  **The Dutch Remonstrants are the world's first *Christian* denomination to perform same-sex unions and marriages.[153]**

Well done! 

&gt;1989 - Denmark is the first country in the world to ***enact* registered partnership *laws* (like a civil union) for same-sex couples, with most of the same rights as marriage** (*excluding* the right to *adoption* (until June 2010) and *the right to marriage in a church*).

&gt;1989 - Braschi v Stahl Associates Co was a landmark case in which the New York court ruled that a gay couple that had lived together for a decade could be considered a family under New York City's rent control regulations. The decision in favor of litigant Miguel Braschi said that protection against eviction ""should not rest on fictitious legal distinctions or genetic history, but instead should find its foundation in the reality of family life.""[162][163][164]

&gt;1993 - Civil Union/Registered Partnership laws: Passed and Came into effect: Norway (without adoption until 2009, replaced with same-sex marriage in 2008/09).

&gt;1995 - Civil Union/Registered Partnership laws: Passed and Came into effect: Sweden (with adoption, replaced with same-sex marriage in April 2009)

&gt;1996 - Civil Union/Registered Partnership laws: Passed and Came into effect: Iceland (with step-adoption, without joint adoption until 2006, replaced with same-sex marriage in 2010)

&gt;1999 - Civil Union/Registered Partnership laws: Passed and Came into effect: US State of California (without adoption, without step adoption until 2001, same-sex marriage in June 2008-November 2008): France

&gt;2000 - Civil Union/Registered Partnership laws: Passed and Came into effect: US State of Vermont.

&gt;[2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_LGBT_history,_21st_century) - **Same-sex *marriages* laws: Came into effect: The Netherlands (*with* joint adoption).** Civil Union/Registered Partnership laws: Came into effect: Germany (without adoption until Oct 2004, then with step-adoption only) - Passed: Finland (without joint adoption until May 2009, then with step-adoption). 

&gt;[2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage#Timeline) Belgium follows suit,

4396,"&gt; Gender dysphoria and gender identity are scientifically proven concepts that are innate to human existence.

I mean, sure. But as I said before somewhere else: lobotomy was a scientifically accepted practice for decades (so much so the guy who invented it won a Nobel Prize), as was phrenology. Last year with the pandemic, scientists from the WHO said masks were not necessary even though they knew they were (meaning, they did it for political reasons). 

Just three years ago [three scholars wrote 20 fake papers using fashionable jargon to argue for ridiculous conclusions.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/new-sokal-hoax/572212/) and they got published and even acclaimed. 

What do I point out these? Not because I am anti-science but because I think that social science isn't always clear, and more importantly can be affected by politics and biases. 

In this very thread, someone claimed that female and male brains are different. I looked it up to check what the consensus on that is and I found several articles with conflicting evidence. Some neuroscientists say they're the same and gender brains are ‚Äúneuro-sexism‚Äù, others say that they're indeed different and have studies to prove it, the others say the studies are badly done or biased, etc. 

I'm not a neuroscientist, nor am I going to read decades and thousands of pages of research. So whoever I end up believing (the camp who say they're different or the camp who say they're the same) is probably going to be political and biased by my life experiences. 

Which is all to say that I take modern social and gender studies with a grain of salt. I think we're in too deep and it's all very personal for a lot of people. 

I'm neither claiming that it's true nor untrue. Just that I'm skeptical either way of what science is putting out nowadays because I can't tell what of it is political and what isn't.

&gt;There are no psychological internal definitions of race or species as it's a purely phenotypical condition

Isn't ‚Äúpsychological internal definitions‚Äù just another way of saying ‚Äúhow you personally identify as‚Äù? 

&gt;it's a purely phenotypical condition

No, they're genotypical too. Just like gender used to be until it got split from sex.

&gt;But society still has plenty of scenarios where gender plays an important role independent if your personality is ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" in a traditional sense: stuff like having the right gender in their IDs, having people address them with masculine/feminine pronouns for gendered languages, having access to the right gender segregated spaces like toilets, being addressed as a mother or father when you have children.

The gender in the ID (which where I live literally says ‚Äúsex‚Äù which is apolitical and shouldn't be affected by someone's gender) and the toilet segregation are the biggest non-issues ever. 

I fail to see why an ID needs to specify whether someone is one sex or another. 

And bathrooms are not a problem in houses with female and male members. 

And as for how they're addressed in forms at school, they could just use non-gender words like parent.

I don't think they should be given as much importance as they're given. 

The issue with gendered pronouns is more complicated.

&gt;Being a father r is not about how you perform the act of parenthood, it's about being a man and raising your child.

There are a lot of people who would cancel you for saying that to be a father you need to be a man. 

&gt;It's fine if you don't believe it internally and still see them as a man internally.

No. Externally, too. I just won't pop their mental bubble and keep it to myself around them, but I don't see why I should hide my opinion. Eventually, I might have to, anything that goes against woke left ideology will be labeled a hate crime and become punishable by law. But for now it isn't.

It's just like a mental pregnancy. You treat the woman as if she's pregnant and roleplay in her delusion, because if you don't she would have a mental breakdown. But you don't actually believe she is pregnant. 

At least for now. Maybe in 10 years, pregnancy will also be a social construct. 

&gt;Not only is he not respecting the subject's gender identity,

You're implying that disagreeing with the way someone identifies is not respecting them. This might be a given to you, but it isn't to a lot of people.

A politician could identify themselves as an honest person, but still steal money from the public. Should we all just acritically accept that they're not a thief because they don't identify as such?

&gt;he deliberately called him a woman because he knew that's the opposite of who he is

No. He called him a woman, because he is a woman. Biological women are women, are they not?

To someone who thinks of themselves as different sex, that might be a bothersome notion to come to terms with, but a truth doesn't become a lie just because it hurts your feelings. Which is the main point I'm trying to argue against here.

By saying ‚Äúthe opposite of who he is‚Äù means you're denying that biological women are women.

Even if you accept that he identifies as a man and should be referred to as man (as I do), at the end of the day he is still a woman in the biological sense. So a woman. And denying that is denying reality. 

You can condemn the attitude and the motive, but not the statement. Or in the words of The Dude: [gif](https://media1.tenor.com/images/2df998371c24c21ba3b8bdb06cf1e3b4/tenor.gif?itemid=4575092)

&gt;People can be racist and not say anything, they won't be punished. But if they reply to an article of an interracial couple saying they don't believe black man can be romantic partners of white women then they're going to get backlash. People can be homophobic and not say anything, but if they refuse to call a gay man who adopted a child as the child's father, because a child can only have one father since it was like this since the dawn of time, you're going to get backlash. If you refuse to call a lesbian's partner her wife, because women can only be wives to men since it was like this since the dawn of time, then you're going to get backlash.

The comparisons are inflammatory.

Disagreeing with the way someone identifies themselves is nothing of the sort. It doesn't imply that you think of them as inferior, think they should be treated differently, should have fewer rights, etc. 

Thinking a fat person who sees themselves as skinny is still fat, or that an ugly person who thinks of themselves as pretty is still ugly doesn't receive the same level of condemnation as disagreeing with one's gender identity.

They don't have a [positive right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights) to force other people to participate in their mental perception. 

Nobody but trans- people have that right. Everyone else has to suck it up and deal with the reality they were given. 

You're short and you want to be perceived as tall, tough luck; you want big dick energy but you have a small one, tough luck; you want to be treated like a bimbo but you're flat and plain looking, tough luck. 

You want to be a different sex, and suddenly it's completely different and everyone has to indulge you. 

Because being tall, having a big dick or being hot are not perceived as ‚Äúprotected social roles‚Äù¬†the way ‚Äúgender‚Äù is. 

&gt;But that's an outdated notion that has changed for the better

*Or*, *or*, *or*,,, it's a new political ideology that has caused far more issues than it's solved such as placing feelings over reality. 

Not all progressive trends are good or stay forever, you know?

I don‚Äôt think either side will be able to budge much on this issue. What the Swiss can do, is vote on the future framework, even if that means that they automatically accept future changes. Alternatively, Switzerland will gradually slip out of the single market to the point of relative isolation. However other than UK, Switzerland is completely surrounded by EU so the disadvantages for them would be even greater.

4587,"&gt;I'd say that sort of soft propaganda is a little different than state mandated propaganda, but you're absolutely not wrong that this sort of thing is deeply entwined with social media and fiction.

My interface is acting weird so I can't copy and paste the appropriate links, but [just have a look at this long, long, looooooong list](https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/). In particular, I suggest you check out [Episode 59: National Pastimes: Mindless Militarism in American Sports](Episode 59: National Pastimes: Mindless Militarism in American Sports), as well as the Hollywood and Copaganda episodes.

&gt;It's, in a way, propaganda to have western, American, or Hollywood values put in a movie about fighting space nazis, but it's not quite the same as a Cold War era propaganda movie paid by and for the US government. Plus we could argue that a lot of those values are good values that are also shared by Europeans who then wouldn't argue with them on r/europe.

You're dramatically missing the point. The values shown tend to actually be pretty universal - be kind and forgiving to the redeemable, defend the weak, especially children, against the predations of those that would abuse them, respect the Law as long as it's reasonable, stand by your friends, stand up for yourself, don't hesitate to be ambitious but be aware that you must put in the work, etc, etc. It's the fact that what is shown onscreen are *lies* that exploit those values to promote actions that are, in reality, antithetical to them. 

Real Life cops do *not* behave like those on TV and movies - they lie, they inflict violence on the innocent, they do not treat people fairly, they defend the interests of the rich and powerful, they look out for themselves and each other above everyone else, to the point of killing hostages, blowing up homes, or running away from a school that's being murdered by a spree shooter, rather than risking their necks in the slightest, **about 40% of them *beat their wives***, etc. 

Real Life militaries do *not* sweep in to rescue innocents and ""fight the bad guys"", soldiers from the boonies that are deployed at ages eighteen and nineteen are played by thirty-year-old actors, the extremely boring, corporate-absurdity bullshit nature of the job is completely glossed over, slaughter is glamorized... 

Real Life governments do *not* act like the folks in *the West Wing*. The *values* the West Wing shows, while questionable in some details, are, in spirit, quite commendable and universal - do a good job, be knowledgeable about your area of expertise, argue in good faith, and gracefully acknowledge when the other side's arguments are stronger than yours. **That is not remotely how anything in DC works.**

I could go on. In short, people get the wrong idea about how bad things are in reality, which allows the bad stuff to continue on unnoticed. I'm among them - up until last year-ish, I wasn't convinced that police were *that* racist, shitty, or morally bankrupt.

I challenge you to find an article where DHS went after someone for making ""anti-american sentiment"" also I believe it's not even their jurisdiction to go after an American for making anti-American sentiments. That goes to the FBI.

I can show you link where the political opposition of the heads of states of Russia and China were imprisoned just for speaking out against their government. I have my links post yours.

4692,"&gt;What does that even mean? What process is particularly hidden in the EP that is visible elsewhere? It's committee meetings all the way down in every parliament, you know. Heaven forbid everything had to be discussed in the plenary, they would never get anything done.

Vote counts, lobbying, expenses, decision making.. The EP is not great across most of that by any standard and various member states do far, far better. The EU institutionally and the EP itself is not particularly transparent. 

&gt;They can leverage that into informal power just as well. Without their approval nothing passes....

Firstly that simply isn't true and...

&gt;, so if they're willing to force the issue they refuse to approve anything that didn't include them in the decision making process to begin with.

No, they can't. More to the point, the EP often doesn't make use of the powers it does have very effectively, it isn't very good at holding the commission to account, it is (and arguably it is designed to be) a relatively weak component compared to the others.  That should change (arguably it absolutely has to) as integration continues, but right now the EP isn't able to influence the direction of the EU as a matter of design, it has limited powers to hold what is effectively the executive to account, it isn't really like a Parliament in terms of powers and scope.

&gt;Again, the whole power structure, the trifecta of powers, is present and functional. The problem is not the EU structures, it's the deliberately imposed limitations.

It is the deliberately imposed limitations, but they effectively fracture the power structure. Yes, there is something akin to an executive, the courts and then the Parliament, but the design and where power sits and where member states have influence (vs an EU electorate) are all pretty important points. 

&gt;Is the Bundestag a fa√ßade because the largest party (for now, watch the next elections) is a composite of CDU and CSU?

No.. The difference here is that the party, or parties that you might vote for that are part of S&amp;D or the EPP in Spain are presenting very different potions when compared to those who are part of S&amp;D or the EPP in Germany or Poland, or indeed France (if you consider LR). They are very broad umbrellas and people are voting for national parties.

&gt;Besides, voters are free to take the allegiance of that party in the EP into account. If they aren't that's their choice.

Of course they are, and there has been a push for trans-national parties at an EU level,  but again the system is sort of set up in a way that almost creates an abstraction layer and a lack of political discourse union wide. It is more fragmented than it needs to be

&gt;And that's not even considering because most people vote for the local representative of the party anyway on the national level too, not necessarily for the party.

Depends on the country. That said, my point would be that at a national level you tend to find all the elements that exist within the EU, but generally in isolation. The EP in that context is relatively weak, there are other weak parliaments within EU member states of course, but they generally see more accountability and direct democratic involvement in the other bits of government.",Ulster,/r/europe/comments/ngu5ut/polish_schools_will_teach_that_eu_is_unlawful/gz5jk41/,marsman,1621772054

Just look at the absolute other level demonstrated by 8 people going out of their way to mildly protest invading of Czechoslovakia in 1968.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Red_Square_demonstration

&gt;The protest began at noon as eight protesters (Larisa Bogoraz, Konstantin Babitsky, Vadim Delaunay, Vladimir Dremliuga, Pavel Litvinov, Natalya Gorbanevskaya, Viktor Fainberg, and Tatiana Baeva) sat at the Lobnoye Mesto and held a small Czechoslovak flag and placards bearing various slogans:

&gt;* ""We are losing our best friends"" (""–º—ã —Ç–µ—Ä—è–µ–º –ª—É—á—à–∏—Ö –¥—Ä—É–∑–µ–π""),
&gt;* ""A≈• ≈æije svobodn√© a nez√°visl√© ƒåeskoslovensko!"" (Long live free and independent Czechoslovakia),
&gt;* ""Shame to the occupiers"" (""–ü–æ–∑–æ—Ä –æ–∫–∫—É–ø–∞–Ω—Ç–∞–º!""),
&gt;* ""Hands off the ƒåSSR"" (""–†—É–∫–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—á—å –æ—Ç –ß–°–°–†!""),
&gt;* ""For your freedom and ours"" (""–ó–∞ –≤–∞—à—É –∏ –Ω–∞—à—É —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥—É!""),
&gt;* ""Freedom for Dubƒçek"" (""–°–≤–æ–±–æ–¥—É –î—É–±—á–µ–∫—É!"").

&gt;Within a few minutes, seven of the protesters were assaulted, brutally beaten and loaded into cars by KGB operatives. The Czechoslovak flag was broken, and the placards were confiscated.

&gt;...

&gt;Vadim Delaunay and Vladimir Dremlyuga were sentenced to three years in a penal colony. Victor Fainberg, who had his teeth knocked out during the arrest, did not appear in court but was sent to a psychiatric prison. Larisa Bogoraz was sentenced to four years of exile to a remote Siberian settlement in the Irkutsk Region. Konstantin Babitsky was sentenced to three years of exile. Pavel Litvinov was sentenced to five years' exile.

&gt;	he totally failed to challenge rising anti-semitism in Labour,

He pressured the governance and legal unit to suspend Red Ken (who had helped establish Corbyn‚Äôs career, and who was instrumental in launching the careers of many of the rest of the old left wingers in his front bench) for antisemitism. That was itself illegal, because the LOTO is not allowed any part in decisions about discrimination complaints once the matter has been referred to the GLU. 

&gt;	Under the complaints process, the GLU should decide whether or not to suspend an individual complained about, pending the investigation of their complaint. LOTO staff should not have any role in these decisions.
&gt;
&gt;	However, we saw an example in our complaint sample where LOTO staff were involved in the decision-making process.
&gt;	
&gt;&gt; In July 2016, the Labour Party wrote to Ken Livingstone, confirming that administrative suspension had been imposed in relation to an antisemitism complaint ‚Äòafter conversations between the Leader of the Labour Party and his staff‚Äô.

When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is in some small way to become evil oneself. One's standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control.""

I agree our submissions never take in the spirit of Eurovision. We either go too far with shit like Scooch of whatever they were called, or we only have pub level singers willing to enter now. His song was just meh, didn't stand out at all, and to do well with Eurovision you have to have some different and something to catch the eye and ear.

I disagree about being bitter and whiny. That redditor you are replying to is obviously making a satirical reply to an idiot making an obvious inflammatory comment. Have a look at the official Eurovision thread and all the UK pisstake comments in there. Replying back to comments like that isn't bitter and whiny, its reacting against dick heads being obviously antagonistic which is fair enough in any walk of life.

UK and to a lesser point Germany and Spain are often down the bottom. So especially from the UK, seeing all the zero and bottom of the table finishes, it's not an appealing motivator for people of talent putting their name forward.

My American ex-wife proudly claims Scottish heritage even though genetically she might be as Scottish as these people are Polish, as she is a mixture of various different European ethnic backgrounds.

5070,"My understanding is that the principal issues they hit causing shortfalls were at the Novasep facility, which would have had capacity but had yield issues when they tried scaling up.

I have seen no serious argument for AZ intentionally overselling capacity.  That is, one can say that they failed to predict how much they'd be able to turn out, but not that they sold what they knew they wouldn't have.

There's also the issue that AZ didn't send the EU doses from the UK facilities when the EU wanted AZ to do so.

Of those two issues, if it's not politics, I think that the latter is *actually* why the EU government is pissed.  Sanofi has delivered nothing at all, is just starting Phase III trials on a second go, so Sanofi's significantly worse as regards their projection of where they'd be, but there's no noise about a lawsuit there.  No yelling at Sanofi.  What Sanofi didn't do that AZ did was have the physical ability to produce in another country and fail to turn over that production to the EU on demand.

Saying 'We may not fit some strict definition, but the government clearly, and openly pursues a similar policy' doesn't even make sense. You can't be 'similar' to a tax haven - you either are or you aren't (and we're not). We're a low tax economy, same as half the EU (and with higher corporate tax than many of them).      

Consider the sources from whom you have heard we're a tax haven - they are pretty much entirely American, French, or German. We're a tax haven to those for whom it suits to call us a tax haven.  

France, for example, are pushing for tax harmonisation within the EU (which conveniently centralises power towards France and Germany) and have often pointed towards Ireland (geographically and politically isolated) as being a 'tax haven'. They do this while our ETR sits around 10.7% to 11%. Meanwhile the World Bank‚Äôs Comparison of Effective (Corporate) Tax Rates for OECD Countries report of 2014 shows the lowest country studied *worldwide* was... France.  

So we must therefore apply the only definition that actually exists and that was drawn up by an objectively neutral body (the OECD). By that definition we are not a tax haven.

Well, this is just incorrect.

Most Polish legionnaires  on Haiti died from tropical illness.

A  smaller number (but still significant) were killed fighting in the French ranks against Haitans.

Some defected to insurgents and died alonside them, but this were few dozens at most.

The rest (about 700 troops) left the island together with other Napoleonic forces.

It was commonly known, that insurgents used to torture to death captured Napoleonic  soldiers, and this factor generally discouraged potential defectors.",,/r/europe/comments/nihkqv/in_1802_napoleon_added_a_polish_legion_to_fight/gz2u00c/,abdefff,1621706834

5578,"&gt;The Clauses
So now we know what these defined terms mean, how is AstraZeneca obliged to make the vaccine? Usefully this has been set out at clause 5 (Manufacturing and Supply).

&gt;Clause 5.1
The clause says:

&gt;‚ÄúAstraZeneca shall use its Best Reasonable Efforts to manufacture the Initial Europe Doses within the EU for distribution, and to deliver to the Distribution Hubs, following EU marketing authorization‚Ä¶‚Äù

&gt;The key words here are ‚Äú‚Ä¶within the EU‚Ä¶‚Äù. The contract is clear that the intention was to manufacture the Initial Europe Doses within the EU. One may question why this was the EU‚Äôs intention given the knowledge that the UK sites were further ahead in ramping up production, but you may want to consider the situation back in August 2020 with ongoing negotiations on the EU/UK Free Trade Agreement and the very likely possibility of a no-deal Brexit. The last thing the EU would have wanted was the delivery of vaccine to be used as a bargaining chip in EU/UK trade negotiations.

&gt;Clause 5.4
&gt;Here is gets very interesting. Clause 5.4 says:

&gt;‚ÄúAstraZeneca shall use its Best Reasonable Efforts to manufacture the Vaccine at sites located with the EU (which for the purposes of this Section 5.4 only shall include the United Kingdom)‚Ä¶‚Äù

&gt;There appears to be a conflict between the obligations to manufacture the Initial Europe Doses in the EU which does not include the UK (clause 5.1) and to manufacture the Vaccine in the EU including the UK (clause 5.4). The EU argues the use of the broad term ‚ÄòVaccine‚Äò in clause 5.4 includes the ‚ÄòInitial Europe Doses‚Äò in clause 5.1, but if so why did the contract include the specific wording for Initial Europe Doses in 5.1? What is the purpose of 5.1 if not to limit AstraZeneca‚Äôs Best Reasonable Efforts for manufacturing the Initial Europe Doses at AstraZeneca‚Äôs sites in the EU alone?

&gt;Clause 5.4 has further interesting conflicts, such as the use of the term ‚ÄòEurope‚Äô where it also uses ‚ÄòEU‚Äô. Use of such confusing and contradictory terms when the interpretation of what constitutes ‚ÄòEU‚Äô (i.e. to include or not include the UK manufacturing sites) is so crucial seems odd to say the least, particularly when you consider the strengths of the respective legal teams at their disposal.

&gt;What does it mean?
&gt;My view is that clause 5.4 requires AstraZeneca to manufacture the Vaccine in the EU and UK (not surprising given it is a UK-Swedish company and has large manufacturing capability in the UK), but specifically the Initial Europe Doses (the EU‚Äôs first 300 million doses) were to be manufactured solely within the EU, not the UK. Clause 5.4 says that the UK is included within the EU only for that clause, not clause 5.1. As I say above, I suspect the EU took this measure back in August 2020 to secure its initial supply in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

&gt;Developing vaccines and ramping up manufacturing is extremely difficult, costly and time-consuming. I have negotiated and drafted Master Research Agreements for clients in the last year for similar drugs and treatments where the research term alone envisaged a 10-year process. The fact that AstraZeneca and Oxford University have done this all in a matter of months is quite simply astounding, and it is hardly surprising that there are some delays to the huge orders that the EU have placed. It is also worth remembering that they are not alone with experiencing production difficulties, and the EU‚Äôs US-German Pfizer/BioNtech order is also delayed.

5617,"&gt; You answered that yourself. 

I stick with my position that AstraZeneca should've promised less doses if EU ordering late had such a big impact on their manufacturing capacity. If AstraZeneca had been more modest in their schedule, this would never had become such a problem.

Had AstraZeneca estimated only 30m doses or even 60m doses by end of Q1, this would never have become such a large problem because the EU could've then done more to get vaccines from other manufacturers early. This only became a problem because AstraZeneca greatly overpromised and were very late to communicate the shortfalls.

&gt; And they shouldn't have screwed over other countries to mask their own incompetence.

Is it the EU's fault that AstraZeneca was not able to uphold its own time plan, or communicate the shortfalls in time? If you think so, then I can understand your point of view, although I do not agree.

How is this true when From the 772 ground losses suffered by Armenia, at least 535 were caused by Bayraktar TB2s. Keep in mind Azerbaijan had only 12 Tb2s. Although an impressive number in itself, even 69.3% fails to reflect the actual worth of the TB2. In addition to striking 535 targets with MAM-L munitions, TB2s identified more targets that were subsequently engaged with loitering munitions, TRLG-230 guided rockets and artillery.

Think of it as a fighter with a sword and a shield. You need to use both in unison to defeat the enemy. Everybody is focusing on the fact that Armenian shield failed after repeated attacks, but not on the fact that they had no sword.

5753,"AstraZeneca shouldn't be making such unrealistic goals if it cannot meet them. I mean, falling short would be acceptable if it meant only delivering 60-70% of the expected amount, but the shortfalls have been huge (29m out of 120m expected doses by end of Q1) and have continued for a long time. As it looks now, they will probably fulfill their original Q1 commitment sometime in Q3. ""EU ordered late"" is a bad excuse, since a) if ordering late means less doses being available, AZ should just promise less doses instead of overpromising and underdelivering, and b) AZ has gotten plenty of time to fix their issues.

Also, falling short is far from the only problem. Another large issue is how the issues have been handled and communicated. Had AstraZeneca flagged about their issues earlier and not just before the first shipments then the EU could've done more to either help or secure vaccines from alternative sources. AZ then proceeded to fall short even of their adjusted target (40m doses in Q1), and there are still heavy week-to-week fluctuations in deliveries and projections, making planning very difficult.

Still, even with these shortfalls, there have been no bans towards exports to COVAX, and all other manufacturers are free to export as well. The EU is supplying the world with lots of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, which are generally more sought after in developed countries than AstraZeneca since the latter have been restricted to certain age groups in many countries.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/ni36ho/eu_persuades_us_to_ease_covid_export_restrictions/gz234qn/,Jacc3,1621693246

I am really lucky because I was in a position to not having to lay people off and I could transition all of us into home office. All our customers also worked from home.

5809,"&gt; Lmao no? It is Israel that is expelling Palestinians from their homes.

In the case of Sheik Jarrah it was the opposite. You fell for their propaganda campaign, congratulations.

&gt; Why? How?

Because they place Arab unity in front of everything else. It is a covert way of telling you they are going to strife for a Pan Arabic Islamic state, which has been their goal since day one. The Palestinians does not want a Palestinian state, they have never wanted that. The first steps toward a Palestinian state was done by an Egyptian and a Lebanese with affiliations to the Muslim Brotherhood that aimed to use Palestine as a way to create a union between Egypt, Palestine and Syria. Get it? It is all a ploy. It has nothing to do with the Palestinian people.

&gt; Why does that matter again? How other countries define their capital in their constitution is irrelevant here.

Answer why it is important to have it in the constitution instead. If Palestine is the only country that does it, why do you think they do it?

&gt;  Still not ethno-state. Ethno-cenctric is still questionable as ""Arab"" includes many different ethnicities in it too. Even though Arab is used as a common denominator ethnicity, it is not as narrowly defined as other some other ethnicities and can and does include many different ethnicities from different Arab countries in it. The comparison to a Jewish ethno-state is not the same as the two ethnicities aren't so easily comparable.

Wh000t? You mean it is not an ethno state when Arabs does it, but it is when Jews does it? Meanwhile, where are the Jewish military commanders in the Palestinian army? Where are the Jewish police chiefs? Oh I forgot, the Palestinians killed them, how stupid of me.

&gt;  Straight up lie as I have already posted and linked many times.

The fact that you have the fucking nerve to say it is a lie when Palestine pays their citizens 300k EUR in reward for killing Israeli children is soo fucking outrageous. They even use my tax money to do it.

&gt; You are grasping at straws here. SPECIFICALLY Sharia no, but the way that that article is written is the same. If Sharia was your point, should have focused on it, dude, if you want to discuss Sharia so much.

Yeah, state upheld Sharia is racist towards Jews. Sharia prevents non Muslims from becoming equal citizens to Muslims. Which is why Christians have to pay Jizya on the West Bank and why Christians in Gaza has to hide their Christian identity from being killed by Muslims.

&gt; Then you are even justifying imperialism, colonization, population resettlement and ethnic cleansing and genocide with your last sentence

Good luck with your life with that attitude.

&gt; You ignored the part about you being Islamophobic, because of course, you continue being Islamophobic even in this comment.

You started by calling me a racist for telling you that having sex with 14 year olds and killing your wife is legal in Palestine. Then you shifted to ""islamophobe"". Yes, I am afraid of Islam.

As you said, technocrats without vision or ideology were given power, and so our governments became unable to think outside the box.

The best example is 2008. After the recession, instead of challenging the free market like it was done after the Great Depression, they doubled down on a failing system. Now, as globalization, wars, immigrations and COVID have stressed it immensely, people search for an answer to why everything is failing.

5837,"&gt;Breton is one of the alive-and-well languages in France. 

In what world is Breton 'alive and well'? The Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg, the official public organisation that looks after Breton, states:

&gt; L‚Äôabsence de statut l√©gal et l‚Äôexclusion quasi totale de la langue de la vie publique et de l‚Äô√©cole jusqu'√† tr√®s r√©cemment ont conduit √† un arr√™t de la transmission familiale du breton √† partir des ann√©es 50. C‚Äôest pourquoi l‚ÄôUNESCO classe le breton parmi les langues en danger s√©rieux d‚Äôextinction.

In other words, that until recently it had no legal recognition, almost no presence in public life and in schools which caused most Breton families to stop transmitting their languages in the 1950s (most native speakers of Breton were born in the 1950s or before that time) and that UNESCO classifies Breton as a language in serious danger of extinction. According to the latest survey that was done, there are around 200,000 native speakers of Breton, most of whom are over 70 years old (meaning that in the next decade or two, we're going to see this number plummet). There were a million native speakers at the start of the century. Breton is actually in REAL danger of completely going extinct, which is why linguists classify it as a language in SERIOUS danger of extinction.

&gt;If anything, it is encroaching on other languages in Brittany, such as Gallo.

Breton is in palliative care, there's literally no way that Breton can 'encroach' upon Gallo, aside from opening up Diwan schools in the East of Brittany, which in no way takes away speakers from Gallo anymore than opening a school that teaches in English (and yes, there are schools in France that teach in English immersion model) would take away French speakers. The Gallo speakers are still there, being completely ignored by the French state and national education. It has even less support than Breton does, and that's saying something.

 In fact your suggestion that Breton as an 'alive and well language' which is eating up Gallo is not only absurd, it's so funny that it's offensive. Have you ever talked to a Breton or Gallo speaker in your life? Every single French language other than French on the European continent is endangered, and it's because one - yes, precisely one - language is killing them all.

&gt;Nevertheless, the new bill introduced the ability to teach french like English or German would be taught. That would create significant issues with the ability of student in their superior studies and to participate in their country's political life.

Immersion schools have already existed in France for decades, we know what level of French that students have when they leave, they get the same or better results in French than the monolingual French kids. There's no 'significant issues with the ability of student in their superior studies and to participate in their country's political life'. 

By the way, the LREM deputies who submitted the appeal did not talk about the level of French of students in immersion schools. They wanted to challenge the forfait scolaire, the fee that communes have to pay to students who want to study a language in another commune.",,/r/europe/comments/niakqj/frances_constitutional_council_rejects_bill/gz1r88e/,paniniconqueso,1621685792

I spent most of my life in Alsace, and I'm yet to meet someone who wants independence or even thinks about it. A lot of Alsatians are proud of their history, most would like the language and culture to get more love, but all consider themselves French (Alsatian first ofc).

I don't know how it is in Brittany but I suppose it's probably between Corsica and Alsace. It's big enough to support itself, it has a distinct cultural identity, yet it's been French for too long.

In the Catalonia topic, France showed strong support to the Spanish government.

5843,"&gt; But what if your true authentic feeling IS that it attacks you?

Then the person should work on it, as feeling attacked by someone else's harmless tastes/features is not a healthy thing, especially if it then brings a negative response that hurts the other physically or psychologically.

&amp;nbsp;

We should all have the possibility to wear our true selfs, exist for what we are. However we live in a civilized society and, as such, this way of life imposes some restrictions which are mainly ""don't hurt the other.""

Bringing it to the extreme: it could be a true self for someone to maim people, this person would act to hurt (more or less intentionally) for no reason other than some feeling of satisfaction, and that is not acceptable. The person is faced with a choice then: work on such feelings and suppress them, or respect them and maim people.

A person who perceives themselves as a man rather than a woman (or is another colour, or sexual orientation), on the other hand, is not performing an action, and even more so not acting to hurt people. This person is existing, regardless of you.

Working our way down, we can see how there is a parallelism between the first example and someone who would discriminate the other for their skin colour, sexual orientation, or gender identification, as they act on the other person to hurt in some way. This person acts *because of you.*

&amp;nbsp;

So, to conclude, if the basis of feeling hurt and respond negatively is the *existence* of the other person, then that is not a feeling that has a place in society",Italy,/r/europe/comments/ng679m/spanish_politician_temporarily_suspended_by/gz1ra9z/,Clapaludio,1621685836

5896,"&gt; simply reflects a difference in average wealth and welfare

Kinda like exactly the same way as when you compare Norway and Romania? Yeah that's the point. It ""simply reflects a difference in average wealth and welfare"".

&gt; WHY would someone persistently push the misleading ""PPP"" data as an alleged indicator of wealth and welfare, instead of the nominal data? WHY?

Because while still flawed, it reflects purchasing power and standard of living far better than nominal GDP per capita. 

[*GDP \(nominal\) per capita does not, however, reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore, using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity \(PPP\) is arguably more useful when comparing living standards between nations, while nominal GDP is more useful comparing national economies on the international market.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product#Standard_of_living_and_GDP:_wealth_distribution_and_externalities)

I answered your question, now answer mine:

- What's the difference between a Heineken in Norway and one in Romania?
- As I mentioned, safety is generally higher here than in WE countries. How does that fit within your theory?
- A majority of US states have higher nominal GDPs per capita than most Western European countries. Yet it's well known that the US falls behind on a majority of statistics (infrastructure, services, quality of life, safety, etc.) when compared to European countries. Why do you believe nominal GDP is still a good way to measure standard of living in this case?",Romania,/r/europe/comments/nie2f0/gdp_ppp_per_capita_in_europe_in_international/gz1s7j0/,RoHouse,1621686533

&gt; How will the two sides cooperate on migration and mobility issues?

&gt; Migration is a global phenomenon that requires global solutions. Partners are committed to a balanced, coherent and comprehensive approach, guided by the principles of solidarity, partnership and shared responsibility. The new Agreement addresses migration and mobility in all of its facets and dimensions, as partners recognise the need for enhanced cooperation to ensure effective management of migration.

In short. We will coorporate.

&gt; Building on article 13 of the Cotonou Agreement, the new commitments balance the need to fully respect international law, with the equally important necessity of respecting the dignity and human rights of all refugees and migrants.

What does that mean? Human rights are a broad concept. A French court found it was against a Bangladeshi migrant's human rights to be sent home because he had asthma and air quality in Bangladesh is too poor. ECHR's article regarding respect for family life stops a lot of deportations of criminal migrants. So it would be nice to have a clarification before getting entangled in yet another international commitment. It is mentioned that this will effect family reunification, one of the hottest topic regarding immigration. But I can't find anything about what commitments EU member states are giving.

&gt; In line with the EU's new Pact for Migration and Asylum, the Agreement sets outs commitments from partners, recognising that migration and mobility can have positive impacts when well managed and the need to address the negative impacts and root causes of irregular migration. This implies working with partners in various areas from peace and security, human rights, to poverty eradication and education to provide opportunities and support partners in developing effective migration management capacity.

Pretty vague.

&gt; Improving cooperation on return and readmission of irregular migrants is a crucial element of the new Agreement and the comprehensive approach to migration management. It will be accompanied by an Annex with operational provisions on return and readmission.

That part is interesting. But overall, it's a bit odd we are signing deals effecting possibly national member states ability to set non-EU migration laws without the details being broadly discussed.
