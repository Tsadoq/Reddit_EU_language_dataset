The very idea that we said you cant. After having broken the promises of the last referendum just is not a restriction to them voting. A vote is basically just a poll. Legal or not. There is nothing boris can do to stop scotland voting. 

If they vote without government support and if that vote goes drematically for leave. Then that is the evidence that most of the points you mention do not mater to the scotish people.

46,"&gt; The ICE facilities are for arresting people who willingly break the law. The chinese ones take literally a million people for their ethnic belonging. How the fuck is the gaping difference between the two so bloody hard to understand?

The point is that ""being worse than the ICE facilities"" still doesn't make something as bad as the Nazis. What the Nazis did is quite documented and if China would do what the Nazis did, there wouldn't be any Uyghurs left. That doesn't mean what China does is ok, far from it, but comparing them to Nazis is factually wrong and only downplays what the Nazis did.

&gt; Yes, and I'm sure they're doing the same with the Falun Gong because of their terrorist activity...

I agree, but adding more examples of bad stuff which happens in China, doesn't somehow amplify said bad stuff. Also, as with the organ harvesting of prisoners, we still cannot say whether it is planned by China or not. Again, the amount of money it brings is too little for China, while it can make individual people or groups very rich.

&gt; Millions of prisoners is not a ""bunch of corrupt officials"", that's a nationwide decision. No, it's not China as a monolith, it is it's reprehensible leadership

What? It is known that the imprisonment is planned by China. I was referring to the organ harvesting. There we do only know that it happens. Again, we do not know how much harvesting happens, since even though there are many reports, there are still about 1 million prisoners. We do not know whether it is directed by the government. We also do not know whether or not organ harvesting also happens in normal Chinese prisons at the same rate.

Those are pretty important details. 

Also my ""monolith"" comment was more referring to trend that when the US does bad stuff, people don't say the ""US does X"", but ""corresponding agency does X"", while in case of others the governments are always treated as one monolith. For example, for the whole conversation we had, you talked as if the ICE thing is separate from the US-government, while you did not do the same with China. The same applies to other stuff, for example when it's about US doing stuff in foreign countries it's the CIA which is responsible not the US, while in other countries it is the government, apparently.

&gt; But this is all all deflection. None of this was the original thesis. The issue is still putting what America does on the same moral level as what China does. The gaping chasm between the two is obvious. To put those two on the same level is nothing but moral relativism.

No it doesn't. Saying that both things are ""Not like Nazis"", isn't putting them on the same level. China is still several times worse than the US, which I also mentioned several times, it still doesn't make them as bad as Nazi Germany.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/e93865/77_years_ago_the_polish_government_addressed_a/fas8yrn/,CDWEBI,1576324834

Personally I think the referendum should have had the requirement of a supermajority, for both results, and if one wasn't reached then it would be repeated in X years until one was reached.

What law allows england to use troops to attack scotland. So how dose England d look whe  it dose anyway. How do english troop raised on ""Iwas only following orders"" stories respond whe told to attack civilians with no violent intent. 

No that idea really is stupid and impractical and any UK gov doing it is gonna face bigger issues then scotland.

Maybe revolution and massive redistribution is actually not in anyone's interest and most people know it.

There's a far left idea which is that people should use democracy in order to ""democratize economy""; in other words use their vote to rob the rich through the democratic process and they consider this a legitimate way to use democracy. It's a ""might makes right"" type of thinking where might comes from having a democratic majority.

Without the MFF however, the member states cannot agree on any detailed plan either since such a plan would immediately force it to become MFF negotiations.

While I have not run the numbers, take for example PESCO and Green Deal commitments together. Can they even be financed with the MFF if you additionally impose a 1-1.1% of GDP budgetary limit?

1) To hold a firearm license in Germany, you already need to go through a ""Zuverlässigkeitsprüfung"", a reliability test. If authorities don‘t deem you reliable enough to own firearms, you‘ll lose the WBK (Waffenbesitzkarte = license) and your guns are confiscated and destroyed. It‘s a good system and works well. 

2) The idiot who tried to shoot up the synagogue used homemade, improvised guns (the article is not correct. Only a few parts were 3D printed, the submachinegun and shotgun were tooled). He wouldn‘t have been affected by this law, and no law in the world could prevent somebody else to do the same thing. Luckily, handcrafting firearms is extraordinarily difficult and the guy‘s incompetence saved a lot of lives. Again, this is uncontrollable.

3) Every couple of years police confiscate weapons from neo-nazis, preppers, ""sovereign citizens"", criminal gangs. Giant piles of rifles, shotguns, handguns, sometimes explosives, even rocket launchers. These weapons are all, without exception, illegally obtained. 

This law addresses a very specific, rare case but ignores the vast amount of illegal firearms in Germany (estimates at roughly the double of legal firearms).",Germany,/r/europe/comments/ea50vp/germany_approves_stricter_gun_control_laws/far286x/,8DDD,1576311161

The kicker of course is what *selected* means. It could be a blanket tariff based on place of origin (unlikely and useless), or it could be tariffs applied based on some other criteria such as fulfillment of EU green minimal standards during production. 

In case of the latter, it won't even single out particular countries but particular producers. Whatever it may be, the US is not being singled out at all.

321,"If nations with developed freight train networks were to generate tools that analyzed the stock market implications of traffic disruptions on the valuations of companies in this market, and were then to make this information (or better yet, the toolset) widely available, people would discount stocks by their exposure to risks in the rail freight network.  Individuals who correctly or incorrectly believe that their economic wellbeing is tied to the success of the rail freight network and/or stocks with high exposure to risks in the rail freight network will then become more attentive to the frequency and causes of traffic disruptions in the rail freight network.

This pressure from a fraction of the public likely to be both erudite and competent can serve as a useful impetus to enable beneficial system reforms if any suitable candidates for reform can be found.  This opportunity correctly utilized should increase the economic efficiency of the rail freight network in affected countries.  This tactic may also be used at somewhat greater risk and somewhat greater reward to enable technological reforms of the rail freight network, due to such factors as the optimism associated with investments in new technologies, ,and the availability of multiple experimental rail technology candidates in the modern world.

Carbon tariffs..?  If we build the industries that support ultra-modern low-pollution transportation processes, and I do mean *build the industries* in a trim efficiency-oriented sense, the emissions profile of developed nations can be reduced even as it becomes possible for rising nations to efficiently modernize in ways that tend to reduce rather than exacerbate the carbon consequences of their growth.  The more we can crack the efficiency issues surrounding transportation at the largest scale, the more we can invent things that generations preceding would never have imagined.

We should consider taking the possibility of Zeppelins into consideration as well.  Slow transit of good cargo and extreme fuel efficiency could gradually replace seagoing ships, protecting the oceans from multiple forms of pollution (acoustic, trash, leaching) while saving funds over the very long-term due to their lack of fuel costs.  While the very slow rate of return makes Zeppelins intrinsically difficult to launch as a practice, requiring as it does investors of exceptional patience and foresight, the potential for free movement provided by harnessing global wind energies is a possibility not to be ignored.

332,"Not so much. More like 5 terrible candidates and 1 decent one if you’re lucky.

You’re supposed to vote for the MP for Con, Lab, LibDem, SNP, UKIP, Green , PC, SF, APNI, DUP, BRX, IND etc. who you think will do the best work in your area.

Instead of that people vote for the party they hate least that also has the best chance of winning. Normally Conservative or Labour (or SNP in Scotland, SF/DUP in Northern Ireland and PC in Wales).

This year, Brexit was a hot topic and the people who kept arguing about postponing it and begging for a second referendum lost favour with most voters. We’ve decided, for better or worse, to leave the EU and the people who aren’t okay with that just come off as people who aren’t happy to not get their way.

On top of this though, Labour was always the counter to the Tories (conservatives). They were the party of the working class, of the everyman. They were a lot more centrist than left wing. Recently they’ve swung far to the left and a lot of their voters weren’t happy with that. To make it clear, a lot of Labour voters go for policy that makes them feel more comfortable; free school meals to take some of the strain off, the NHS to take the worry out of health issues, University grants to allow everyone the chance to go to University without crippling the family. “Casual” Labour voters don’t really go in for ideology which is what Labour brought a lot of this year.

People were also unsure about where Labour were going to be pulling the funds for their miraculous schemes from which lead to a lot of uncertainty

Add to that the terrible “First Past The Post” system that we have which makes voting for a third party (unless it’s the SNP) pointless and you really have only one option, vote Tory.

If you look at a map of the election, the swathe of yellow in the north (as well as green/purple in the NW and green in the SW) stands out and that stands as a testament to how terrible the English two party system is.

Yes, and I'm sure they're doing the same with the Falun Gong because of their terrorist activity. ""Several researchers—most notably Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas, former parliamentarian David Kilgour and investigative journalist Ethan Gutmann—estimate that tens of thousands of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience have been killed to supply a lucrative trade in human organs and cadavers and that these abuses may be ongoing.[2] These conclusions are based on a combination of statistical analysis; interviews with former prisoners, medical authorities and public security agents; and circumstantial evidence, such as the large number of Falun Gong practitioners detained extrajudicially in China and the profits to be made from selling organs.""

Millions of prisoners is not a ""bunch of corrupt officials"", that's a nationwide decision. No, it's not China as a monolith, it is it's reprehensible leadership.

But this is all all deflection. None of this was the original thesis. The issue is still putting what America does on the same moral level as what China does. The gaping chasm between the two is obvious. To put those two on the same level is nothing but moral relativism.

Yes.  But my point is not only that it would not persist, but that doing so as far as is possible doesn't benefit the UK.

&gt; America is unique in that they are the closest thing to an autarky on this planet. Their 50 states compete in an integrated environment and under one language and federal legal framework.

We have few barriers to internal trade.  And having few barriers to internal trade is indeed advantageous, because it increases economic efficiency -- people within one state are not forced to buy within just that state, but can take advantage of producers that exhibit comparative advantage in other states.

But that's not an argument that running a trade surplus with the outside world is advantageous.  The same reasons that economic efficiency rises as barriers to internal trade go away cause economic efficiency to rise as barriers to external trade go away.

&gt; The American is the consumer who fuels the planet's economy, which is why tariffs are less effective against them.

So, okay, you did hit on an over-simplification, and that's that national security is an externality to the market for goods and services.  That is, there are cases where one wants to avoid trade because having a dependency at *all* is disadvantageous.  That's typically why one only sources military hardware domestically or from countries that one is committed to trusting, or why one only sources goods that one cannot go for long without a supply of (natural gas being one popular subject around here) from countries that one is committed to trusting.

And if you don't internalize that externality, yeah, you can get inefficient outcomes.

But broadly-speaking, that factor doesn't dominate the merits of trade -- that is, I don't normally say ""I refuse to trade with *anyone* in anything because it would expose me to external factors"".

In the US, the US Constitution *guarantees* certain powers to the state and the federal government *may not infringe in those areas*.

547,"&gt;The link says that there's not much empirical evidence that small parties dominate coalitions 

But I didn't suggest that they dominated coalitions, but rather that they get a disproportionate influence from being part of one. I don't think that's really in question, a junior coalition partner is going to have more influence and power than a larger party that isn't in a governing coalition. We saw that with the Lib Dems i the CON/LIB coalition..

&gt;If a minority of the population gets a majority of the seats in Parliament, and that majority effectively gives them complete control over the government, it is fundamentally undemocratic.

No, it's not, its just not proportional. Democracy doesn't require majority rule (indeed lots of systems specifically implement mechanisms to minimise that) nor does it preclude things like FPTP that are designed to create larger majorities while ensuring people have their own representative in parliament.

&gt;No one votes for their local MP unless their local MP is nationally famous. 90% of voters vote for their favourite party/leader.

And yet that is the system we have (and I voted for my local MP despite the party leader..).

&gt;Northern Ireland has PR (sub-nationally), and it's still based on constituencies. Constituencies just have multiple representatives.

Yes, and return a proportionally larger number of MLA's than MP's. I'd assume you aren't suggesting that the UK go for a system with 3250 MP's?

573,"&gt;But I didn't suggest that they dominated coalitions, but rather that they get a disproportionate influence from being part of one. I don't think that's really in question, a junior coalition partner is going to have more influence and power than a larger party that isn't in a governing coalition. We saw that with the Lib Dems i the CON/LIB coalition..

That's because the other party isn't part of the government. That's not a fair comparison. A fair comparison would be comparing a small member of the coalition to a bigger member of the coalition. 

&gt;No, it's not, its just not proportional. Democracy doesn't require majority rule

It does though. By definition, minority rule is undemocratic. Democracy means ""rule of the people"" not ""rule of some people."" 

&gt;(indeed lots of systems specifically implement mechanisms to minimise that)

There's a difference between minority rule and constitutional limitations.

&gt;And yet that is the system we have

And most people don't use the system the way it was designed, because the system was designed before organised, ideological, political parties even existed. 

&gt;Yes, and return a proportionally larger number of MLA's than MP's. I'd assume you aren't suggesting that the UK go for a system with 3250 MP's?

No, but the House of Lords has 800 members. We can afford to expand the Commons by a couple hundred members, at least.

593,"&gt; Oh, fuck off. There's nothing to argue here anymore. A million people are in camps and you're arguing semantics while simultaneously comparing it yourself to ICE determent facilities. Either that's someone with an agenda, or so myopically pedantic as to not see the parallels.

The irony of you calling me myoptical and pedantic. I read your opinion of the US situation and you also seem to disagree with the notion that the US is like the Nazis because of that. People who do think that can use the same rhetoric you use against me right now to discredit you, by saying ""you are arguing semantics"". China is much worse than the US in that regard, but the same principle applies.

&gt; This ain't Godwin's law, when you target an ethnic group with the express purpose to wipe out their culture in ""reeducation camps"", and yes, harvest their organs, evidence of which is aplenty, the comparison is absolutely fair.

I'd be interested where you have this ""express purpose"" from. The camps exist to deter any separatist forces plus deter terrorism, since Uyghurs are China's biggest source of terrorism (whether you personally feel it is ""justified terrorism"" or not). If they wanted to wipe their culture out, much more Uyghurs would be in those labor camps. Plus, I think, if the goal was to ""wipe them out"", China could have used various incentives to motivate Han Chinese people to immigrate there, so that Uyghurs could be silenced ""democratically"", how it happened in the US, Canada, Australia etc.

Yes there is evidence of organ harvesting, but there is no evidence of whether it is regular or whether it just happens sometimes, but since there are so many prisoners, the volume is huge. Plus we do not have any evidence whether it is mandated by the Chinese government or whether it is the doing of corruption. Simply from the financial standpoint it would make more sense that it is done by corrupt officials, since the money made is a big amount for individuals but not for a country. Not caring about those details and lumping everything together as if the Chinese government is a monolith may be fine to you, but it doesn't represent reality, no matter how enraged you are.

&gt; The idea that these are political prisoners is ridiculous.

865,"**Poles are helping an Iranian truck driver. The biggest problem turns out to be... the Law**

For several days now it has been loud about the fundraising campaign for an Iranian driver who regularly drives between his country and Poland, but had to make a longer stop due to the breakdown of his truck. It is now known that he will not return home with his tractor. What's more, the amount collected by the Poles is not the end of his troubles.

Although the media have only been broadcasting for a few days, 40ton.net has known the Fardin Kazemi truck tractor since the middle of last year. In 2018, this editorial office received the first photos of an exotic International truck on our roads, which the readers saw in Poland. This 30-year-old veteran of roads comes from Iran and his every journey to Poland is about 4-5 thousand km (depending on the route). What does he drive? Raisins.
The truck finally surrendered.

An old Iranian truck stopped on one of the courses in Siedlec Duży. Fardin tried to start the engine but failed. Quite soon his Polish colleagues became interested in the subject of the accident. It was amplified by the aforementioned 40ton.net service.

Initially, it was supposed that the starter had failed, but finally, after a deeper check, engine wear was detected.

The truck comes from the years 1986-1987 - at that time such internationals 9670 were exported to Iran. These are American, very durable vehicles, but in such demanding conditions as this one had, finally surrendered. It is worth noting that in the Middle East countries trucks are not as well maintained as in Europe.


**Why a collection and not a phone call to the carrier?**

Those involved in helping an Iranian have decided that they will not leave him now, when there is nothing to go home with. The aid was initiated by Wojciech Głąb, joined by Henry Hill, Łukasz Bzdura, Andrzej Ostrowski, Bartosz Sołtys and Grand Service. A collection of money was organized in order to collect 99 thousand zlotys for the purchase of a used truck for the driver.

There may be a question about the meaning of the collection, because an Iranian can call his company and ask for help. Unfortunately, the situation is that he is the company and the tractor and trailer are his. Nobody can help him in this situation. Repairing a vehicle is all about it - that's what a truck driver in this country does.

Fortunately, Poles have already collected over 150 thousand zlotys, although the campaign called Help International is to end only on 10 January 2020. Already now there are doubts about the sense of buying a truck, because it turns out that the money is no longer a problem.
Iranian may have problems after buying a truck

As I was able to determine, the money that Fardin Kazemi did not initially have to repair his tractor is now the least of his worries. The real thing is the choice of vehicle, and it's not about taste, but... the rules.

It is difficult to clearly determine which tractor to buy, especially at what age, so that the driver can legalise it in his country when he returns. This is about customs and local regulations. About one third of lorries in Iran are over 35 years old. Although you can buy a much newer vehicle for the collected amount of money, it is for the too advanced age of the vehicle that our hero can pay a high price. In this case, it will be the import of a car. It is even supposed that he will not be allowed to enter the country.

Another problem is the embargo imposed by the European Union on the export of 'dual-use' goods to Iran. It is about any equipment that could be used in the military and in the energy sector. Admittedly, in theory, vehicles are not subject to this provision, but apparently the practice is quite different. Services can simply stop any equipment with an electronic system.

That is why it is already being suggested to go to Iran and buy a lorry on the spot. What about the one that is broken in Poland? Can it not be repaired?

Initially, it was said that it was too expensive and above all time-consuming, but unofficially I learned that with the amount of about 150 thousand zlotys, which may still increase, such an Internation can be not only quickly repaired, but even restored. But for the time being this is not a topic that torments our guest.",,/r/europe/comments/ea91dn/poles_are_helping_an_iranian_truck_driver_the/faom602/,andrzej1220,1576267440

941,"China actually makes stuff that people want to buy. Sweden doesn't have much going for it by comparison and has a stagnant, declining economy with an aging population. Ericsson doesn't even make anything that anyone wants, while even in Sweden, Huawei has a 10% market share in the smart phone sector.

Huawei is a ***PRIVATELY OWNED COMPANY*** and has absolutely nothing to do with the Chinese government***.*** Sweden itself has its fair share of state-owned enterprises. Swedish Telecom is a state-owned public utility, responsible for Sweden's telecommunications system, so it looks really strange to be attacking China for having state-owned enterprises, among which Huawei is not one.

&gt;Sweden is a functioning democracy with one of the highest qualities of life in the world

Sweden literally has an unelected, hereditary monarchy, while the Chinese got rid of their monarch more than 100 years ago. 

&gt;, a very high HDI, and very high freedom rankings.

What does this have to do with anything? Japan has a higher GDP and HDI than China, but China is absolutely killing Japan in the realm of consumer electronics, and Huawei is doing a way better job than Sony in making phones. Somalia has no taxes, no regulations, no troublesome rules to prevent Somali businesses from reaching their full potential, but that doesn't make Somalia better than Sweden, now does it?

&gt;Or they can pick the state owned Enterprise of an authoritarian dictatorship that has the largest concentration camp network for ethnic minorities since the nazis.

You're comparing China to Nazis now? Perhaps take a look at the European Union.

There's the Brown Book, which lists the Nazi Party connections of 1,800 business leaders, politicians and leading officials of the Federal Republic of Germany. In the third edition of 1968, more than 2,300 people - including 15 ministers and secretaries of state, 100 generals and Admirals of the Bundeswehr, 828 judges, prosecutors and high court officials, 245 senior officials of the Foreign Office and 297 senior police officers and employees of the constitutional protection authorities were shown to have Nazi Party connections.

China is conducting legitimate measures self-defense and counter-terrorism in Xinjiang. China has proven that the most effective way to combat religious extremism is to transform and educate people's minds so that they lead healthy, productive lives. China does not need counter-terrorism lessons from European countries that seemingly get hit with radical religious extremist terror on an almost bi-monthly basis.

&gt; Consequently, the same state owned Enterprise helped build the dystopian mass surveillance system 

So, China must be denied the right to have a security system? CCTV surveillance cameras are in the number of 4 million to 6 million in England, seems like every street in London has a camera monitoring you.

&gt;It also got it's start in Telecom equipment by stealing IP from Nortel which eventually bankrupted the company.

What a ridiculous thing to say, he's actually a somewhat competent politician, it's impossible to call him a good person but he's nowhere near as bad a person as Trump. He's a fucking weirdo, I'd call him eccentric but he is much more mentally stable than Trump. He takes his job more seriously than Trump. I don't agree with his politics but he is nowhere near as bad as Trump. His politics are basically left wing compared to Trump. Are we forgetting Trump literally is orchestrating mass child neglect on the border. Johnson doesn't have anywhere near the ego of Trump, the absurd ideas of Trump. Johnson likely won't even be as bad as the last prime minister Theresa May, possibly the worst PM in modern history. Useless, ineffective and a spineless coward. Johnson has said some offensive things but even that isn't even in the same ballpark as Trump who is literally an open racist, at least Johnson pretends he's not and even then it's more old posh cunt thinks he's better than others and it's just banter rather than vile, evil hatred.

I dislike Johnson, I think it's an embarrassment to the country that he is PM. I dislike his politics and I think there is a real risk of no needed changes, Brexit going badly and the NHS continuing to be run down. I voted Labour and thankfully I'm part of a constituency that always does vote Labour. However saying stupid things like Brits can't talk about Trump just ruins conversations and makes you look stupid.

956,"&gt; Russia interfered in the 2016 election 

Nobody is claiming that they didn't. This is a fact, and in no way whatsoever corroborates any allegations of collision. 

&gt; The Mueller report showed that Trump's campaign attempted to establish communication with Russia

No, it did not. This is a lie.  It showed they were reached out to about damaging information and Trump campaign turned it down. FBI failed to desiclose exculpatory evidence in which Papadopoulos, when asked about Russian intel that could be damaging to Hillary's campaign, said that it would be treason. 

&gt; The Steele dossier was opposition research with potential avenues for investigation into Trump, that then found the light of day.

Paid for by Hillary Clinton's campaign, relying on Russian intelligence, unverified and and since utterly discredited on all fronts, by the FBI itself. 

&gt; What was Roger Stone, a Trump advisor, convicted for again? Even if Trump himself wasn't involved, there's a pretty clear pipeline of information

Stone lied to congress. He bragged about having access to WikiLeaks when he did not. 

Also, Julian Assange is a hero to all of mankind. He's the definition of a patriot. 

&gt; Again, Trump conveniently surrounds himself with criminals, who do what is in the best interest of Trump. The media should be asking questions to find the truth

1172,"You are quite historically and geopolitically uninformed. Can't blame you,

1. UK is much more alligned militarily with the US than Europe.
2. Ever since the beginning of the Cold War, the Western alliance would have a soft split between the US-UK axis and French continental interests, which lead to  the US-UK denial to give France more voice in the Western defence affairs and then culminated in the Elysee Treaty of 1963, geopolitically separating the US-UK axis and Franco-German axis of Continental Europe. Here, just read the transcript of a meeting that took place between J.F. Kennedy and French minister of mr. Malraux in 1962:  [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v13/d249](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v13/d249) 
3. UK is so alligned to the US militarily that it doesn't even have an independent nuclear deterrent. Both UK and US fingers are on the button when it comes to UK nuclear capabilities. The French have their own, because they always opposed such dependence on the US + defence integration with it. Even when it came to an ideological enemy - the USSR, the geopolitical perspective in France still prevailed.
4. The French Presidents since De Gaulle have been calling to be friends with Russia (yes, that would be the USSR at the time), Macron is talking about a ""Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok"" and yet somehow UK is giving gifts to Russia? Macron is shouting everywhere he can so people would hear that ""Russia isn't that bad and we need them"", and you don't make conclusions out of that? So you just close your ears to fit your ""Trump Putin slave"" narrative? Not like European sanctions are de facto void at this point or anything. But I guess European policy masks work best on European public very well.
5. China's long-term goal in Europe is to make Europe a ""geopolitically independent player."" The real reason for that is so that Europe wouldn't be an unconditional supporter of the US, which would be extremely beneficial to China. Especially when China is so dependent on the US. 

Just a note note because everyone likes to pull that card, I've learned most of these things in a political science class taught by a French professor who is very pro-liberal-world-order+pro-French guy and just basic pol science studies. I can't blame people for not knowing things because nobody teaches geopolitics at school, but it's crazy obvious why that is the case. 99.9% of European knowledge of geopolitics on the scale from 1 to -1 is not even 0, it's -0.9 or something.",,/r/europe/comments/ea25us/this_is_the_only_picture_you_need_to_see_to_help/fann0cb/,Gremlinator_TITSMACK,1576245492

1178,"&gt;You know that Thatcher also met with the IRA

I know that pretty well, but Thatcher was still officially a unionist, while Corbyn has said on record he supports a United Ireland. Corbyn opposed the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985 with explicitly stating that he wanted a United Ireland and that agreement didnt help, link to source below.  Only the unionist and republican parties did not support the agreement. Guess why the republican parties and the IRA didn't support it - for the same reason that Corbyn didn't - they wanted a United Ireland. So comparing orbn's negotiations with the IRA and Thatcher's is not very approariate, they seemed to have different end-goals in mind. One of which does not include preserving the union of Great Britian and NI, which, as yo ucan imagine, was and still is a highly controversial topic in NI.

The SNP are an extreme example of the other direction, where they benefit from this system.  They only run in scotland, meaning their votes are all concentrated there, and end up overrepresented because they are the single biggest vote-winner in almost every constituency.

1345,"&gt; But at the same time, I can't deny that right now, European politics (at least in my country) is mostly an afterthought of people, and there is no united discourse among parties. The european conservative block for exemple is anything but united, and its talking points aren't the same everywhere.

That will only happen afterwards as a result of having to cooperate in a union. Besides, that's not a bad thing. Conservatives are at a competitive disadvantage to the left in such a situation because of their narrow local focus, while the left has the ideological predisposition to cooperate across borders (unfortunately also one to fracture ideologically). So either the left has an advantage, or the conservatives are forced to overcome their narrow provincial focus by seeking common ground across Europe. It's a win-win situation. For example, look at how the discourse shifted from hate against foreigners which could as well include European states to a discourse of Europeans vs Non-European immigrants. They have been forced to adapt a broader, more inclusive view.

&gt;Creating a credible leftist domestic position in a world with barriers to enacting leftist policies (nationalisation of railways could lead to opposition regarding other matters) is already pretty difficult. Creating a transnational platform that answers the needs of the Polish factory workers, the Swedish teachers, the German artists, the Croatian students is a whole other order of magnitude. And while I can think of solutions at the national level, I can't think of european solutions that I could argue for. And I've never seen any intellectual, politician, ""expert"" or twitter political commentator to help me either.

That seems easy to me. For example, social dumping practices need to be tackled at the EU level, resulting in higher social benefits standards for the more recently joined members. But one of the key elements that needs to be done is that labor unions and the like need to overcome their dependency on national governments to fix things for them. They should also be willing to strike across the EU, for example if they're having a conflict with a company, then it's much more effective to apply pressure if they can hold a strike in all branches of that company across the EU, rather than only in one specific country or factory.

&gt;Unfortunately for me, ""Workers of the world, unite"" isn't enough to create transeuropean policies :)

Socialism is such a broad sprectrum of ideas in a number of catagories; economic, political and philisophical. They use this word as a knee-jerk reaction that fits their own resentments.

Some ideas that support the economy are indeed socialist, such as the monetary policies Reagan used to recover the US trade market. Yet these are the actual policies people agree with.

Brexit is also equally misappropiated. People have too much of an absolutist view of the problem; leave completely *OR* stay forever. There several options to consider, such as Denmark choosing leaving the EU but staying in the Euro.

This is the problem. Our goverment is not being clear on our options, giving disinformation over stupid issues like immigration. It's not actually a question of just leaving, it's actually just renegotiating a contract.

&gt; You and your community can impact, flip and decide that seat. 

These words have no meaning. You're just describing how the system works. Plus, that's how half of all seats are decided in the German system anyway.

 In the German system, half of all seats or slightly less are constituencies and the rest is filled by party list votes to make it fully proportional. It's a system that has the best of both world and is, in my opinion, far more preferable than straight up FPTP.

I don't think the popularity of PR or FPTP is a convincing argument. I'm sure most Germans would vote to keep PR in a referendum and Brits FPTP. People are usually unwilling to change and more likely to vote for something they are already familar with. 

PR does not favour urban voters. Assuming constituencies are roughly the same size in terms of population, which is true in most FPTP systems, urban voters don't have a bigger impact than their share of the populationy regardless which system is used.

Under straight up FPTP, people are practically forced to choose between 2 or 3 parties and there is a large discrepancy in the way people want to vote and the people actually vote.

1574,"You really don’t know how? Well let me tell you something about tax breaks then.

Ok say I made $50mil in 2019. That would require me paying approx $20mil in taxes. So I hire an artist to paint me a “modern painting” or just slap some cow shit on a canvas. I pay this guys $20,000 for getting his hands dirty (pun intended).

Well next I get my best friend Joe, who is an official art appraiser (and he spend time becoming an expert for this very same reason), to appraise this “art” at $40mil.

In turn I donate this $40mil to a museum of my liking. In return I get a $40mil tax deduction, living me with only $10mil of taxable income (if I am not greedy enough to call it a $60mil donation and carry over the loss to next years taxes).

There are versions of this where I may hype up this artists career for years or pay a publicist to make him famous overnight, making his “art” worthy of million $ pieces. The options are different but the scam is the same, the rich get to deduct their “art” donations.

That my friend is how you get bananas stuck to the walls or monkey shit on canvas. Even if this particular stunt was not specifically a tax write off, the tax write off scams have deteriorated “art” so bad that somehow this is now acceptable.",,/r/europe/comments/e9nmgm/albanian_volunteers_march_past_austrohungarian/famyu7b/,ManVSReddit,1576217157

Biden has already regained a 10+ lead in the poll averages and even the Bernie guys who appearing to be pushing the most damning bashes of him as neoliberal this center right that on social media *don't actually hate him* like they do Pete Buttigieg so I expect that nomination locked up soon.

1607,"Okay, I agree the term is loaded, I misunderstood what you meant sorry.

Regarding the edit since I don't agree with comparing what was said to the example you chose:

 The 'demand' which was really just a request and the EU serving the interests of some of its citizens. The US does the same with for a recent example being the US threatening EU countries and placing tariffs in retaliation for the french GAFA tax to 'make an example' of them. There's also the Boeing/Airbus dispute. Both the US and EU do it. There's times when it's more or less  egregious and I feel like this particular isn't that bad.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Which is entirely irrelevant to the usage of the phrase, as it deals with them having American citizenship at all.

It is related as the renunciation is mostly that they don't want to be liable for taxes they only legal are a citizen of and have no other affiliation with. The scenario exists with for example being born to american parents outside of the US.  All they are asking is for reduced cost for individuals to renounce citizenship by choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand how the edit  is a relevant comparison, the EU asked :

&gt;  leading European Union official asked U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to reduce the cost for renouncing U.S. citizenship. 

I don't see how it compares as here it's a question of renouncing citizenship, it's not as if they asked the US to give citizenship to all EU residents in the US, which would of course be pretty unacceptable to demand. It's all a question of point of view, but the point of view of the concerned  'accidental americans' who maybe had american parents but have no ties to the US or the desire to move there, they shouldn't have to pay exorbitant fees to get rid of the tax liability. 

I see the reasoning behind wanting to tax citizens abroad but if you want to renounce the privileges you get as an american citizen in exchange for not being taxed abroad, then it should be your right in my opinion.",France,/r/europe/comments/e9mouu/eu_asks_us_treasury_to_cut_cost_of_citizenship/fampaym/,camomanef,1576209333

**""We call on Poland to explicitly condemn discrimination against LGBTI people""**  


At the end of November Jakub Gawron, Kamil Maczuga and Mirka Makuchowska hosted the EP, where together with MEPs discussed the situation of LGBTQ people in Poland. Politicians and politicians have announced the preparation of a resolution in which they will address to the activities of Polish local governments adopting ""anti-LGBT declarations"". As Gawron informed in social media: the project was published and included the comments of Polish activists.  
Jakub Gawron, LGBTQ activist responsible, among others for co-organizing the Equality March in Rzeszów, he announced in social media that the European Parliament's draft resolution on the situation of LGBTQIA people in Poland is now ready.  


Gawron adds that his and Paulina Pająk's suggestions regarding the activities of some Polish local governments, which in recent months have adopted the so-called ""anti-LGBT declaration"".  


SEE ALSO  
""Atlas of hatred"" - a map of ""anti-LGBT"" resolutions Several dozen local governments are still working on similar declarations  


""Since the beginning of 2019, about 80 communes, poviats and voivodships in Poland have adopted declarations describing them as"" free from LGBT ideology ""or adopted the so-called"" Local Government Charter on the Rights of Families ""or adapted its key provisions that are openly discriminatory in relation to families monoparental or created by same-sex couples; whereas the provisions of the said resolutions call on local government authorities to refrain from taking any action on tolerance towards LGBTI persons, providing support to non-governmental organizations working to promote equal rights, organizing anti-discrimination education, or in any other way a way to support LGBTI people; whereas these resolutions are part of the wider context of attacks on the LGBTI community in Poland, which include increasingly hate speech by authorities and public media, as well as attacks on equality marches and issued for bans on their organization, as well as other events raising awareness, such as Rainbow Friday ""- we read in the document.  


**In addition, the resolution called on the European Commission to check the expenses related to grants awarded to local authorities. They appealed to remain in constant contact with national, regional and local authorities in order to remind them of their duty to act to combat discrimination and remind them that EU funds cannot be used to discriminate against selected social groups.**  


**""We urge Poland to explicitly condemn the discrimination against LGBTI people, also if it is a manifestation of the actions of local authorities, and to repeal resolutions that hit LGBTI people, including local declarations' against LGBT ideology ', in accordance with national and EU and international law,' it was written in the resolution.**  


In a conversation with us, Jakub Gawron announced that the vote on the project will take place on December 18, probably around 2:00 PM, and the groups have time to submit amendments by December 16. He added: ""I am happy with the resolution. All my and Pauline suggestions have been taken into account.""  


Gawron wrote about these suggestions:  


    *- listing not only resolutions against ""LGBT ideology"", but also the Local Government Charter on the Rights of the Family, adopted in the form of not only entire resolutions, but also its key elements implemented into local law. Such an example is the newly adopted voivodship Podkarpackie cooperation program with non-governmental organizations. It has a provision (Chapter III, point 1.8, pp. 4-5) excluding support for organizations ""which undermine the identity of the family and marriage"" (Chapter II)*  


    *- an appeal to the government to repeal resolutions in accordance with local law (i.e. by means of province governors or administrative courts)*  


    *- an appeal to the government to monitor these resolutions. Despite the obligation of local governments to send information to the voivodship supervision authorities on adopted resolutions, in practice voivodes have incomplete information on adopted anti-LGBT positions. For example, the Podkarpackie voivode, upon my request for public information, sent me a list containing only six self-governments with adopted resolutions, while in reality there were already 17. In addition, most voivods refused to disclose information on the list of these resolutions. They make me show my public interest*  


    *- an appeal to the European Commission to verify compliance with anti-discrimination provisions, which local governments have committed to comply with when signing contracts for projects financed from EU funds. Local government officials are awaiting talks with EU officials about how their resolutions relate to anti-discrimination provisions in e.g. educational projects.*

1737,"&gt; Are you stupid? I guess I should already know the answer to that, you're a Trump supporter. Let me quote your own article back to you: ""What’s happening here? Donald Trump hasn’t sprinkled MAGA pixie dust over the U.S. economy. In fact, his trade war has clearly diminished employment growth in industries, that are sensitive to foreign markets, such as manufacturing. Rather, a tight labor market and state-by-state minimum wage hikes have combined to push up wage growth for the poorest workers. The sluggishness of overall wage growth is concealing the fact that the labor market has done wonderful things for wages at the low end.""

That is the journalist's own take. Tightening immigration inflows and putting a stopgap on outsourcing absolutely creates a tighter job market with higher demand for workers on the lower end, raising wages. The data speaks for itself, it's simple math. If you have a smaller labor pool, there is higher negotiating power for that pool.

&gt; I'm starting to think you can't read. Again, the article you quoted doesn't say anything about a 700% increase in manufacturing jobs. In fact, there's plenty of evidence that reports of manufacturing jobs coming back are overblown, and that foreign investment in the US has decreased

Here you go, that data is in another article:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckdevore/2019/01/04/312000-jobs-added-in-december-manufacturing-growing-714-faster-under-trump-than-obama/

&gt; Not to mention, this is all short term. What is Trump doing about the long term issues we're facing with automation, jobs lost due to climate change, etc? Nothing except tweeting attacks agains 16 year-olds. 

Automation is an inevitability, but climate change? Are you 13 years old? No jobs are getting lost due to climate change, Jesus Christ.

&gt; Oh my god, 1000 bucks! Really? What a life-changer. 

For a family or individual on a tight budget? Absolutely. You sound like Pelosi with your elitist attitude.

&gt; ""The Tax Act is so complex it affects each family differently depending on their personal situation. If you have a very high income, the tax plan helps you the most. The Tax Foundation said those who earn more than 95% of the population would receive a 2.2% increase in after-tax income. Those in the 20% to 80% range would receive a 1.7% increase. The Tax Policy Center said those in the bottom 20% would only receive a 0.4% increase. If you inherit a lot of money, the larger exemption for the estate tax will benefit you.""

You're absolutely right that, as a leftist, the best case scenario after having the whole world unite and libetate its workers, which is not happening soon, is to unite the European in  way that allows States to enact nationalisation policies, actual wealth repartition and solidarity in the institutions and social benefits.

But at the same time, I can't deny that right now, European politics (at least in my country) is mostly an afterthought of people, and there is no united discourse among parties. The european conservative block for exemple is anything but united, and its talking points aren't the same everywhere.

Creating a credible leftist national position in a world with barriers to enacting leftist policies (nationalisation of railways could lead to opposition regarding other matters) is already pretty difficult. Creating a transnational platform that answers the needs of the Polish factory workers, the Swede teachers, the German artists, the Croatian students is a whole other order of magnitude. And while I can think of solutions at the national level, I can't think of european solutions that I could argue for.

1854,"&gt;However, with the [Roman conquest of Britain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_conquest_of_Britain) the Latin term [Britannia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britannia) was used for the island of Great Britain

&gt;Britannia was used by the Romans from the 1st century BC for the British Isles taken together.

Is this a Wikipedia quote contest? The roman province was not Britain it was Britannia since they spoke Latin not British. And yes that now refers to everywhere. Just as before the 1st century the whole place was Britannia, the Romans might (debatable) have used Britannia for their rule, then the next 1500 years Britain meant the whole island. Wik

How about an 11th century source in Historia Regum Britanniae? Or is that too recent for you?

A dictionary was, since modern everyday usage is apparently not relevant for you? 

https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/britain

Looking in my passport I notice it says British, not Great British. Weird, huh. I guess I'll check in the future whether the people I'm talking to are roman administrators of Britannia from millenia ago.

1914,"&gt;GDP increase rate is no. 1

Mainly from EU fundings and western european corporations. Life conditions meanwhile one of the lowest, even Romania is catching up, which is something that most hungarians would have laughed 20 years ago. Productivity is literally lower than it was in 2010, most of the gdp growth comes from the crash of our currency + the fact that people working more and more. 

[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tesem160/default/table?lang=en](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tesem160/default/table?lang=en)

&gt;  crime rate is among lowest in EU 

Murdering rates double than western europe, while the government media constantly making drama about how people are in constant terror in the west cause immigrants. 

&gt;  the stop migration policy was copied by Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, tourism is on a rise, etc. 

Isnt the reason why 200k immigrant was stuck in hungary for a week was that Austria closed down the borders INSTANTLY? Hungary was never a target country by immigrants, they just walked through it like they did with 20 other countries. After austria closed down their borders, there was no point entering hungary. 

Tourism on the rise in every single central european country, hungary isnt doing any better than other central european countries.

&amp;#x200B;

1920," &gt;I am deeply skeptical, not of the idea that the planet is getting warmer, but of what people propose to do about it, and what their real motives are.

'Real' motives? I am sympathetic to the movement, purely because the evidence is overwhelming that humans are causing climate change and severe consequences can occur due to a changing climate. My motive is 'stop the bad thing happening so future generations have a chance'. That's not to say I'm doing that much personally, but I support action being taken where it can.

&gt;The greenhouse effect, to the extent that it's man-made,

Well, it's not just the greenhouse effect, but many other problems. Air quality is one, and there's good evidence that pollution is damaging to developing brains.

[You need only google 'hockey stick graph' to get a good idea of how obvious the effect is.](https://climateaudit.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/2014-bas-hockey-stick.png)

&gt;India and China are the big ones here, but there are others. More will continue to join.

I'm not sure why we have to wait for them to do something before we do anything.

We can switch entirely away from fossil fuels. We can invest in green technologies. Storage solutions. In the future we won't be using any fossil fuels. Wind and solar are already becoming cheaper than coal and that trend will continue. The largest offshore windfarms are being built around the UK coast and these will continue to grow. 

Nuclear may well have it's place. I'm not ideologically opposed to it. Certainly it provides constant energy at theoretically little environmental impact. There is of course the waste to consider, but if we're going purely on the now, it's worth considering Hinkley Point.

Self interest, as you point out, is a fantastic motivator. 

The problem with Hinkley of course is that by the time it is built it will be many times over budget. 

Worse, it will also cost more to buy energy from than offshore wind. Thats not going to benefit the public who needs the energy.

Yes, wind and solar are variable, but storage options are increasing and costs continue to fall. 

Power generation is of course not the only issue. Transport, food production and all kinds of issues are involved.

1933,"So your proposition for resolving the conflict is us giving away a huge part of our EEZ? Hell, why don't you just.. idk.. let go of that part of the Med? That would also resolve the conflict, right?

Again, Greece is well within its rights when it comes to its EEZ. Turkey not signing the treaty doesn't bind it but practically it only affects Turkey since everyone else in the world backs Greece in its claims. Turkey can start denying all kinds of international laws but that won't remove the legitimacy that everyone else has according to these laws. We can both keep it like that but if things do turn ugly, chances are it will be only the expense of Turkey is it the party that is the odd one out, not to mention diplomatically isolated. 

The deal with Cyprus was messed up in the last moment when Turkey pushed for extra terms that big even the TC has asked for. Up until that point the two sides were agreeing and at that point the GC side had to reject the final draft of the plan. 
50 years ago there was EOKA, Greece was a dictatorship and the Enosis idea was still alive. None of these exist today and if you're saying that you're afraid that the same thing would happen again if Turkey withdraws, you're either brain dead or just a liar. Last time it happened the Cypriots lost half their country and Turkey is still right next to them. Honestly why the fuck would there be violence again? Who would it be benefit?

1935,"&gt;The gas pipelines were a political security feature and Germany threw a budding democracy

The gas pipeline were a political security liability for Germany. Ukraine decided previously that their gas supply was more important than Germanys gas supply when it decided during one of the many gas price problems it had with Russia to extract gas meant for Germany for itself.

*Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.* is very true in this regard.

Now, i don't fault Ukraine for doing this. The 2 top reasonable reasons why countries go to war with each other are food and energy. I would fault no country for starting a war if there were shortages.

&gt; in which people by and large just wanted to live like Europeans, under the bus in the name of saving a few bucks. 

This was not about money, the little transit fees didn't matter. It was about energy security.

Counter question, if Germany would not build NS2, in case Russia shut down alle pipelines going to the EU for some reason, would anybody here be willing to freeze in winter and send their gas to Germany? No i don't think so.

And not least of all Poland, the planned Baltic Pipe is also an off-shore pipeline conveniently evading Germany.

You have to remember that the guy had no interest in getting elected, it was basically a comedian doing a publicity stunt of sorts. Apparently some voters thought it'd be hilarious to get him elected though..


Here's a small ""article"" thing from ""Forsvarsavisen"" (The defence news paper) where they're writing about new MREs and stuff (not from Jacob's time but way later in 2015 when they're making some new changes again) and they have some ""Did you know?"" or ""Fun facts"" type stuff on the side.. I assume you can throw it into Google Translate or whatever. :P

&gt;NEJ, JACOB HAUGAARD
&gt;INDFØRTE IKKE NUTELLA

&gt;De  fleste husker nok Jakob Haugaards valgløfte fra
&gt;folketingsvalget i 1994 om “Nutella i feltrationerne”.
&gt;Den folkekære komiker blev som bekendt valgt ind, og
&gt;umiddelbart efter kom der faktisk et nutellalignende
&gt;produkt i feltrationerne, hvilket - fejlagtigt - kobles til
&gt;hans ellers sympatiske hjertesag. Sandheden er nemlig,
&gt;at chokoladepålægget allerede var under indfasning
&gt;da valgkampen rasede, og at det blev indført imens
&gt;Jacob Haugaard sad i Folketinget, kan tilskrives et rent
&gt;tilfælde. Chokoladecremen blev i øvrigt udfaset igen i
&gt;forbindelse med den forrige revision af feltrationerne
&gt;i 2009/2010.

According to them it was planned before Jacob was even in politics, and they were already implementing it as the older MREs were used. It was apparently just a coincidence that his election and their plan to try out ""chocolate spread"" (not Nutella) in the MREs happened in the same period. They've since stopped using chocolate spread again. They obviously do find his ""Nutella in the MREs"" idea a nice one though. :)",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/e99cks/the_suns_subtle_preelection_front_page_uk/fal9amt/,Dnarg,1576180540

In my opinion DNA does not make someone Greek, German, Italian etc. Populations mingle and mix. However there is something that we have common with Ancient and medieval Greeks, shared and common identity based on language and the feeling of a continuity. You can not deny it, I cannot deny it, noone can deny it , no matter how hard someone tries. If you want to go that direction though, I would he glad. But I dont care about genetically and this is not what connects me.

The ancient kingdom of Macedonia is different from the providence of Macedonia during the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman Empire. Yes slavs are here for centuries and they are as macedonians as anyone, but I'm too. And since states are based on ethnicity and not something else, we need to draw distinctions because other problems might occur. They are slavs from Macedonia ( This Slavomacedonias) and we are Greeks from Macedonia. No matter how much you try to change it, that's how things are. 

And here we come to the main problem. Historical revisionism. None can come and claim part of my heritage and history just because it fits their agenda. None. That's why I'm so ""dense"".

* The Proto-Slavic clusters \**kť/tj* and \**dj* become palatal *ķ* and *ģ* in Mk but produce the clusters *št* and *žd* in Bg. So ‘night’ is Mk *noķ*, Bg *nošt*.
* The vowel \**ě* (jat) becomes *e* in Mk as in the Western Bg dialects, but alternates between *ja* (*’a*) and *e* in Standard Bg as in the Eastern dialects. So ‘snow’ is Mk *sneg*, Bg *snjag*.
* Schwa is a full-fledged vowel in Bg but not in Mk, where it often corresponds to other vowels, or is pronounced but not written.
* Literary Mk has fixed stress on the antepenultimate vowel; in Bg stress is free.
* The forms of the definite article in Mk (and some Southern Bg dialects, but not Standard Bg) distinguish three degrees of remoteness: Mk *kuķava*, *kuķata*, *kuķana* ‘this house, the house, that house’, Bg only *kəštata* ‘the house’.
* Clitics (short forms of pronouns) are always in second position in the sentence (and the noun phrase) in Bg; in Mk they can start a sentence.
* Regarding basic vocabulary, Standard Bg is based on the Eastern dialects, whereas Mk is closer to Western Bg.
* Macedonian uses a triple system of indicative pronouns (this/that), i.e. **овој, тој, оној**; as well as a triple article system: **-ов, -от, -он** depending on the distance to the speaker. Bulgarian uses a two-member set of indicative pronouns (**този/ онзи**) and a single article: **-ът/а, ят/я**. This is the case in literary Bulgarian, in the western and southern (Rhodopi) dialects, however, there is the same triple indication and triple article system (i.e. in Rhodope dialects).
* Macedonian uses a single set of interrogative and relative pronouns/ adverbs (what, who, when, where, how): **кој, што, кога, каде, како**. Bulgarian differentiates the interrogative from relative pronouns/ adverbs: **кой? какво? кога? къде? как?** vs. **който, каквото, когато, където, както**. This is the case in literary Bulgarian, in western dialects the interrogative pronouns are used as relative pronouns, just like in Macedonian. Macedonian has a way to distinguish relative pronouns by adding the pronoun **што: кој што, како што, каде што, кога што**, but it is not mandatory.
* In Macedonian, it is mandatory to double the direct and indirect object with the object pronoun: I gave the book to Peter: **Му ја** дадов книгата на Петар. \[“I gave **him it** the book to Peter”\] Іn Bulgarian this is the case only in spoken language. The literary language avoids the doubled in/direct object: **Дадох книгата на Петър**. \[“I gave the book to Peter”\]
* Present tense: verbs of all three conjugations in Macedonian have unified ending **-ам** in 1st person singular: (пе**ам -еш,** од**ам -иш,** им**ам -аш**) for 1st person singular. In Bulgarian, 1st and 2nd conjugation use -а (-я): пе**я -еш,** ход**я -иш**, and only 3rd conjugation uses - ам: им**ам -аш**.  
Endings for 1st person plural are -еме, -име, -аме in Macedonian **пееме, одиме, имаме**, and -ем, -им, -аме in literary Bulgarian **пеем, ходим, имаме**. However in spoken Bulgarian, not only in Western Bulgaria but also in the East, the same set -еме, -име, -аме is used.  
In 3 person plural, Macedonian verbs of 1st and 2nd conjugation use the ending - ат (пе**ат**, од**ат**), while 3rd conjugation has the ending -аат: им**аат**. In Bulgarian, all three conjugations of the verb use the same ending ат, ят: - пе**ят**, ход**ят**, им**ат**.
* Future in the past: Macedonian conjugates the main verb and puts it in imperfect (past continuous) tense, while the future tense particle (**ќе**) remains unchanged: **јас ќе дојдев, ти ќе дојдеше**. Bulgarian conjugates the future tense particle as an auxiliary verb: **щях** \+ a subjunctive **да**\-clause for the main verb: **аз щях да дойда, ти щеше да дойдеш** (I would come, you would come).
* Future tense clauses denoting possible action in Macedonian use **future** tense, perfective: **кога ќе дојдеш, јави ми се** (when you \****will*** come, call me), Bulgarian uses **present** tense, perfective: **когато дойдеш, обади ми се** (when you come, call me = same as in English).",Da Norf!,/r/europe/comments/e9lnm1/bulgarian_academy_of_sciences_there_is_no/fakurxv/,dedokire,1576173480

2146,"* Past participle: Macedonian uses only the Slavic passive (**-Н, -Т**) participle, which is transformed into a general past participle, similar to Greek, Romance, Persian, Germanic, etc. languages: **дојден, повикан, срамнет.** As this is formally a passive participle, the change is that it can be used with intransitive verbs also (such as **to come, дојде**). In Bulgarian, the passive participle is only used with transitive verbs, while with intransitive verbs the so-called past active participle (L-participle) is used: **дошъл**; **повикан (been called)** but **повикал (have called); сравнен (been leveled)** but **сравнил (have leveled)**. *Correct me if I’m confused here, as I don’t know 100% the rule in Macedonian. \** Serbian here resembles Bulgarian: **позван** (been called) **позвао** (have called).
* Present perfect tense. In Macedonian, the verb **имам + past participle** is used **имам дојдено** (literally the same as English **I have come**), which is completely unknown in Bulgarian. In Bulgarian, only the verb **СЪМ** \+ past active participle (the L-participle) is used: **дошъл съм**, just as in Serbian: **дошао сам/ došao sam**.
* Unaccented pronouns and the verb to be, the so-called (en)clitics. In Macedonian they can take 1st place in the sentence, in Bulgarian they follow the first word. Example:  
Bulgarian: Видях **го** на улицата. Macedonian: **Го** видов на улицата.
* Formation of plural of the nouns. The neuter nouns ending in -**e** in Bulgarian form their plural form by adding **-та** or **-на**: пол**е** \- пол**ета**, врем**е** \- врем**ена**, човеч**е** \- човеч**ета**. In Macedonian neuter nouns ending in -**e** change it to -**иња**: пол**иња**, врем**иња**, човеч**иња**. Most masculine nouns of one syllable form plural in Bulgarian by the ending - **ове**: дом - дом**ове**, град - град**ове**, син - син**ове**. In Macedonian, they add the ending -ови: дом - дом**ови**, град - град**ови**, син - син**ови**.
* Phonetics. Generally, Bulgarian (and Serbian) is “phonetically conservative” within the phonetic framework of the Eastern Bulgarian dialects. It tries to preserve the etymological and phonetical link to Slavonic / other Slavic languages, within reasonable limits. While Macedonian is “phonetically revolutionary” - it denotes phonetic changes that only exist in very conversational Bulgarian (also in Serbian). Such are the disappearance of **Х (H)** sound, the transformation of **ХВ (HV)** to **Ф (F)**, assimilations of **ВН (VN)** into **МН (MN)**, etc. Examples: MK: **ајде, алиште, апсен, фаќам, рамно**, **фала**, BG: **хайде** (spoken: **айде**), **халище, хапс** (a Turkish word, obsolete), **хващам (**conversational: **фащам**)**, равно, хваля се (**spoken: **фаля се)**. For comparison: Serbian **хајде (**spoken**: ајде)**, \_\_\_\_ (word doesn’t exist), **хватам**, (у)**хапшен**, **равно, хвала (**spoken: **фала)**.
* Accent. In Macedonian, the accent follows a rhythmic rule, whereby it mostly falls on the third syllable from the end of the word. In Bulgarian, there is no comprehensive rule and the accent can be anywhere.",Da Norf!,/r/europe/comments/e9lnm1/bulgarian_academy_of_sciences_there_is_no/fakusik/,dedokire,1576173488

You will get very different results for who emits the most depending on how you group people.

That's not how convictions work. Similarly if a person is sentenced to prison for X years, but later it turns out that he is innocent, that doesn't mean that the judge and the jury are going to be convicted to a prison sentence.

Also even if we were to apply your way of thinking, I disagree that the judge and the jury should be put to death because I don't believe that the murder of 1 man warrants a death sentence in the first place.

If as some example someone A is forced to sit at an table for 26 hours without drinking or eating and after 24 hours they receive a glass of water and they believe this glass of water has poison on it and wont drink it, if you keep telling the person A that drinking this cup of water would be a good thing (assuming the world where this water dont has poision inside) and they stupid for not doing it (and waiting 2 extra hours to drink water), what you are doing is worthless. This because at the alternate world they think they are (where the cup of water has poison at it) drinking the cup of water would be a bad idea, try to convince them first that the water has no poison at it or every argument about how spending 24 hours without water is bad, will be futile.",,/r/europe/comments/e9k5kb/polish_state_television_tvp_info_is_not_happy/fakg2c3/,spaceman06,1576166533

2335,"As I said elsewhere, two or three years ago France was ahead of Japan &amp; Finland, and now they ranked it below Spain. How  could France fall from its rank like that? I think it might be because of ""statistical inflations"". They put Spain above France because the Spanish have a longer life expectancy and apparently a higher rate of schooling. However, that doesn't mean anything, since unemployment is twice as high in Spain and some of its regions (especially in the south) are much poorer than any region of France, not to mention the related opportunities and the average income. So I think it is mainly related to statistical inflation: similarly, three years ago, France was above Japan and Finland, which was very probably wrong if we compare the state of development of those two countries that were well above France, already at the time.

Looking at 2018 in the EU we have the following: 

1) Air Italy (IT): Meridiana and their subsidiary Air Italy merged to form this new company, so actually not a new company. And they only merged to replace Alitalia which filed for bankrupcy in 2017 as main Italian airline.

2) Air Leap (SE), was founded by the owners of FlyViking after FlyViking went bankrupt. They also took on the assets of Nextjet which also went bankrupt

3) Blue Air Moravia (CZ), was founded and shut down within months. Never had a flight take off

4) air FISCHER (CZ) - relaunched from former Fischer Air / Charter Air that went bankrupt in 2005. This is their newest attempt at an airline, but it seems doubtful that the company will survive for long

5) Freebird Airlines Europe (MLT) - subsidiary of Freebird Airlines from Turkey

6) Great Dane Airlines (DK) - this one is a real startup it seems that works

7) Laudamotion (AT) - renamed / relaunched from previous Amira Air. Acquired by Ryanair when their main partner ceased cooperation

8) Norwegian Air Sweden (SE) - new subsidiary by Norwegian Air Shuttle

9) Ryanair Sun (PL) - new subsidiary by Ryanair

2469,"If you look at the other comment I made here I basically lay out my proposal but I can go into more detail.

The key points are that yes, indeed it is reasonable to not decommission existing nuclear power plants if they're not of i.e. the Chernobyl type.

 It is a fact that building new nuclear power plants is prohibitively expensive in the West and likely very expensive  everywhere in the world. 

It is also a fact that building them takes a long time up to over a decade. Since carbon emissions must imperatively be reduced now to a significant extent, time is simply not on nuclear powers side at all. In addition, even if safety standards were reduced significantly - which is bound to result in *extremely* bad press and citizen resistance - we must accept that most countries and regions in this world lack the resources, workers, capital and experience with nuclear power to render it a viable option for significant and fast global decarbonisation. This is excluding the potential dangers of proliferation and drastically increased numbers of UF6 transports (and thus of catastrophic accident chances).

All in all, existing nuclear power plays a role but new nuclear power is very unlikely to be the answer. Fusion will not play a role.

Stable green sources of electricity are available. The challenges of a regenerative energy system do not really involve technology. To a large extent it is economy and to a greater extent absence of political will. Renewable energies can be inserted into existing grids without problems up to a certain penetration. Beyond, the grid must be strengthened and expanded but this is feasible. 

Once very high levels of penetration are reached, means of storage and dispatchable power sources are important. Here batteries hold a lot of promise for short-term storage while P2G technology can take care of long-term seasonal storage. CH4 can be generated by hydrogen reacting with CO2 in the air. As much of our daily lives as is humanly feasible must be electrified. Only where this cannot be done at all, we can rely on synthetic fuel for now and hydrogen in the mid to long-term. In general we must also become more energy efficient and avoid useless consumption through sector coupling and a smarter and more conscious lifestyle. Policy change must accompany all of this.",-6 points 9 minutes ago,/r/europe/comments/e9k9b6/conservatives_take_1m_in_election_dirty_money/fajr8vz/,Bojarow,1576152061

It is just beautiful how the PiS done it and how stupid the Polish peasants are. Most of the people that vote for them are the ones that lives in small village, have no internet and the only tv station they have is TVP. After winning 4 years ago, first thing they done was to get the power of the only free public TV station that everyone has - the TVP. Every evening, they put only good news about how good they do, how good Poland looks in Europe and how nice is to get ""free"" 500 Polish zloty for having a single baby. (They receive another 500 when they get their 2nd baby and so on - BUT STILL they pay more for that in taxes). 

You can imagine that those people are thinking - let's make another baby because we will have more free money for alcohol. I don't even want to start about the conservative religion, the woman's rights, the LGBT rights, the racism and discrimination or nevertheless - rising imports of coal and other fossil fuels.

2569,"Some initial reactions from someone working in the field:

&gt; he found that 65% of this funding winds up in the hands of only five organisations: the UN agencies for migration and refugees (IOM and UNHCR, respectively), German development agency GIZ, the Italian government, and French organisation Civipol. 

That still leaves 35%. But anyway, the concentration is a consequence of the EU's policies in grants. In the early 2000's, there were dozens of contractors, bidding for hundreds of small scale projects. EU delegations found out that it takes less effort to manage one big 10 mio countract than 10 one-million contract. So they started publishing larger block.

Granted, there were a lot of cowboy among the small fish, but since you need 10 million in cash before you are allowed to run a 10 million project, the small contractors were pushed out of the market. Contracting has become more complex, auditing is crazy. As a team leader, I spend 90% of my time simply doing the admin of a project: if we want to build a school, we need 3 months of approvals for the budget, and have to justify every euro spent to 3 sets of auditors, both locally and in our EU office. Yes, the Big Six make good money on EU projects.

The concentration means they are putting all their eggs in one basket: if one of the 10 small projects fails, meh, if your one big one fails, yeah, that sucks. So hence the audit requirements and micro-management.

&gt; But as things currently stand, these organisations never even get the chance to try. In addition, African countries aren’t even allowed to vote on EUTF projects, but can only sit in as observers at meetings where projects are chosen. 

Yeah. I can give you a million reasons why getting the local administration involved in where money should be allocated, is a baaad idea. But mainly corruption. And graft. and Nepotisme.  It's not that we don't take local needs into account, far from it: delegations spend a lot of effort on working with beneficiaries and agreeing country needs. This then becomes a Framework Agreement between the EU and the receiving country ""EU to build more schools"". But where that school is built and by which contractor, is best left to the experts.

&gt; But in stable countries such as Ghana, Senegal or Kenya? A crisis?   
&gt;  
&gt; Since when are projects such as improving border control in Ghana,  creating more jobs in Senegal,  or helping refugees in Kenya to become more self-reliant  a matter of life and death? 

They are not a crisis for the countries, per se, but irregular migration has been declared a crisis by every man an their dog, from the UN to The Sun newspaper.

&gt; And even in countries such as Mali, where the northern region is indeed in crisis, many EUTF-funded projects have no direct link to the actual source of the emergency. Surely there’s no way of framing the improvement of civil registration in Mali  – an issue that the government has been putting off for years – as the result of an unforeseen disaster that exempts it from normal procurement procedures? 

In a health crisis, you can treat people or build a hospital. I see a direct link between resoling irregular migration and ""improvement of civil registration"". How can you monitor irregular migration in Mali, if you can't see who are residents and who are migrants?

&gt;  “For example, through the EUTF, the EU may have indirectly funded ‘security forces’ in Sudan that brutally suppressed peaceful protest marches in Khartoum, resulting in bloodshed. This was certainly shocking news and a major scandal, but it was frankly the result of hasty and ill-considered standing policies.” 

Not ill-considered, but a prioritising driven by public opinion. We are funding the Turkish government for housing migrants, we have basically handed over a tenth of the Mediteranean to the Libyan government (if such a thing exists). The migrant crisis has put a freeze on human rights. That's what makes the migrant crisis so hard to resolve: it forces us to make hard choices between protecting our borders or upholding human rights.",Flanders (Belgium),/r/europe/comments/e9fpgg/how_the_eu_created_a_crisis_in_africa_and_started/fajm3u2/,Kingfisher_ybw,1576144853
2570,"Honestly, its not. And its not surprising as well. That declaration gives legal way for EU fund to act immediately and respond without additional red-tape. For all the talks about bureaucracy in beginning of article, this move cut it out by wide margin.

And you see how IOM receives the largest funding? Think for a while why is that. Why does UN agency have to receive such a large chunk of money? Perhaps because its Director General please for increase funding have been ignored in New York for years and years and years and only one who stepped up to help IOM is EU?

And at the end of the day, you have very, very large chunk of European population who believe that spending 4 billion in Africa on some projects that prevent migration is 4 billion wasted, just as the mythical ""Marshall fund for Africa"" is. And that solution to migration lies in full-on militarization of border and handing over authority over maritime lines to navies instead of coast guards and SAR agencies. If various professors of migration want to take this under fire because they are irked that money is channeled to agencies that EU can control and audit, instead of african ones which are notoriously corrupt, then I don't want to hear him being upset when the result will be scrapping of that and Australianing the Med, with warships patrolling the seas and Tunisia being bough off for maybe quarter of this expense in order to go full Nauru.

&gt;No matter what the EU says, this so-called “migration crisis” isn’t an African crisis – it’s a European crisis. A crisis of how much solidarity EU member states owe one another, who is responsible for taking in asylum seekers, and exactly how to go about “protecting our European way of life”.

All completely legal and accepted things to do in your free time, as long as you fulfill your duty towards society.

For school aged children, this duty includes going to school. By refusing to go to school and instead protesting, they go outside of their own ""private hobby"" sphere. Their message is ""society fails to fulfill its duty towards us, so we won't fulfil l our duty towards society"", and ""why should we go to school and study science when you're not listening to the scientists anyway"".

In a deep sense, this makes the protest very radical, while it is at the same time completely peaceful and nonviolent.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/e9k5kb/polish_state_television_tvp_info_is_not_happy/fajm5rl/,muehsam,1576144932

That's how conflicts emerge. Both sides are convinced they are right and think the other side is maliciously denying them their rights which must be retaliated and it then escalates from there because everyone thinks the other one is the true offender. Yugoslavia in the early 1990s was a perfect example of this. Conflicts of interest are unavoidable but can only be resolved peacefully if both sides are willing to negotiate and to consider the validity of other side's perspective.

I'm not invested in this conflict but simply from looking at the maps it seems to me that Turkey's claims are not totally unreasonable in comparison to the status quo where Greece's claims look rather unfair towards Turkey.

Largest increase in air passenger transport in Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Slovakia

In 2018, the largest number of air passengers was recorded in the United Kingdom (272 million passengers), followed by Germany (222 million), Spain (221 million), France (162 million) and Italy (153 million).

The number of air passengers carried in 2018 rose in all EU Member States compared with 2017.

Among the top 5 Member States in terms of air passengers transported in 2018, the highest increase was registered in Italy (+6%).

London/Heathrow remained the EU’s busiest passenger airport in 2018, with 80 million passengers handled, slightly up (+3%) compared with 2017.

If the EU is serious about becoming a geopolitical player in any respect(which they've publicly failed at, several times since Trump was elected) they need to prove it. A great example would be subsidizing and building out an industry that can battle out with Huawei. The US is not actively competing with Europe on this, and is in fact BACKING Nokia and Ericcson. The US has planned investments because it knows that these companies are it's biggest hopes to battle with Huawei. But if Europe isn't stepping up the plate, the US investment is not only going to go to waste, but eventually the US is going to subsidize homegrown 5G companies that can compete with Huawei in the Americas. 

I just don't understand why Germany, why Europe is allowing such an obvious geopolitical opportunity, one that can help add a pillar to western support and the transatlantic power, go to waste.

Spain registers more deaths than births as native population heads for collapse




  
MADRID, December 11, (LifeSiteNews) – Spanish authorities revealed that tens of thousands more citizens died than were born in the first six months of 2019. The alarming statistics not only reveal this time period to have the lowest birthrate in almost 80 years, but they also highlight the country’s trend toward what observers are calling the country’s “demographic suicide.” 

According to the Spanish National Statistical Institute (INE), between January and June of this year, Spain saw only 170,074 children born. In this same time frame, 215,478 citizens died. This means that there was a decline in Spain’s population by 45,404 persons during that period. Having a death rate higher than the birth rate indicates a shrinking population.

According to the INE, the number of births registered for January-June this year represents a drop of 6.2% in comparison to the same period in 2018. This is the worst birth rate ever registered by Spain, which began keeping birth statistics in 1941, just two years after the devastating civil war in the country that caused as many as 2 million deaths in just three years",Spain,/r/europe/comments/dc6l9s/greece_hit_by_low_birth_rate_negative_net/faj6pyf/,madrid987,1576126122

You are correct that opinion pieces follow looser rules than factual reporting. BUT putting an opinion piece on the front page and marking it as an editorial stance is shady as fuck.

Don't get me started on the current obsession with opinion pieces. They are page-fillers. They are McJournalism. BUT even if they take less time than boots-on-the-ground, seek-out-primary-sources flat-footed journalism, they still need to follow the rules of a proper and complete argument. So a good OpEd still has some value.

BUT THIS IS A FUCKING BOLD LETTER TORY CAMPAIGN AD. No matter what you do, if you are blatantly partisan, you give up all lofty claims.

And before you argument that proper journalism is biased against the neo-fascist alt-right, then all I can say is that the known facts are biased against them.

The term ""fake news"" got popular around 2014/15. And it was exactly that. Websites with made up stories bat-boy style popped up to get that sweet, sweet adsense money. Only bat-boy was replaced with heroic firemen who rescued cats from burning trees which had been set alight by evil muslims. They tried to sell similar stories to non-rightwingers. But the rightwingers was where the money was at.

Fast forward a year and Trump and his lickspittles used the legit temr for real faked news reporting and employed it to describe factual reporting they didn't agree with.

So don't get me started on ""fake news"".

The emphasis of opinion pieces are a sign of journalism being in trouble. Lazily inviting flat earthers and geographers to the same panel show are a sign of journalism being in trouble. Blatantly picking soundbites out of context are a sign of journalism being in trouble. Politicians producing those soundbites so the attached media can cherry-pick it is a sign of journalism is being in trouble. People not noticing that my last two point describe propaganda is a sign that journalism is being in trouble. Fuck Fox and Sky.

 Illegal, discriminatory, restricting rights and freedoms - the  Ombudsman found resolutions adopted by local governments aimed at ""LGBT  ideology"" as an unacceptable violation of several principles of the  Polish Constitution.  Adam Bodnar complains about resolutions in administrative courts 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In  over 50 communes, poviats, as well as in some self-government  voivodships, resolutions were adopted on counteracting the ""LGBT  ideology"".  And the number of these resolutions is still growing.   The Ombudsman stated that they were ""contrary to the constitutional  principle of legalism, according to which public authorities operate on  the basis and within the limits of the law"", and ""discriminate against  non-heteronormative and transgender persons by excluding them from the  local government community.""

The Ombudsman lodged the first complaints against selected resolutions to five different voivodship administrative courts. 

 The Ombudsman has statutory powers to lodge a complaint with the  Provincial Administrative Court in a matter of general interest.  Now he has exercised this right.   Complaints refer to the resolutions of the municipalities: Istebna  (Śląskie Voivodeship), Lipinki (Małopolskie Voivodeship), Klwów  (Mazowieckie Voivodeship), Serniki (Lubelskie Voivodeship), Niebylec  (Podkarpackie Voivodeship). 

[In the Ombudsman's opinion, the resolutions](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.rpo.gov.pl/pl/content/rpo-skarzy-do-sadow-uchwaly-samorzadow-o-przeciwdzialaniu-ideologii-lgbt&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700256,15700259,15700262,15700265,15700271,15700283&amp;usg=ALkJrhit9dg-3dOKN9Z1dfAsBqo6U9WQBg) : 

* are contrary to the constitutional **principle of legalism,** according to which public authorities operate on the basis and within the limits of the law; 
* constitute an **imperious order**  for the executive bodies of the commune and other subordinate bodies to  which the municipal councils were not entitled to formulate; 
* **discriminate against** non-heteronormative and transgender people by excluding them from the local government community; 
* **limit the rights and freedoms of the commune residents  - their right to private and family life, freedom of expression, the  right to education, the right to teach and the right to raise children  in accordance with their beliefs - in an unlawful manner, because  restrictions on these rights and freedoms can only occur in the Act .** 

## Where did LGBT free zones come from? 

For the first time the idea of ​​resolutions appeared in the Lublin region.  On March 26, 2019, councilors of Świdnik almost unanimously adopted a [resolution](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://spswidnik.bip.lubelskie.pl/upload/pliki//stanowisko.pdf&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700256,15700259,15700262,15700265,15700271,15700283&amp;usg=ALkJrhgAZrLa0bsuNnJBWcutV6aP8NgfXA)  in which they protested against ""a cultural revolution that violates  freedom of speech, innocence of children, the authority of the family  and school, and the freedom of enterprises.""

2905,"Similarly homophobic and transphobic messages are expressed in documents in different ways.   Some local governments are opposed to ""LGBT ideology"" or ""gender  ideology"", others - in harsher words - postulate the fight against  ""promotion of homosexuality"" or ""homoterror"". 

## ""Tomek's freedom in his house?"" 

 Although the documents adopted by local governments are not acts of  local law and have no direct legal consequences, they should be treated  as ""resolutions within the meaning of the provisions governing the  activities of local government"" and ""political expression of the will of  public authorities"". 

And in this case one cannot speak of freedom in creating similar policies. 

""In accordance with art.   7 of the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the Supreme  Administrative Court, local government is to operate on the basis and  within the limits of applicable law.  This protects citizens against excessive interference by authorities **in areas that should not be affected.** 

The Constitution - specifically art.  32 - prohibits discrimination against anyone for any reason in political, social and economic life.  Therefore, public authorities have a duty to build a society that is equal. 

**Similarly, no provisions can be found that would authorize action against minority groups;  those whose aim would be discrimination or exclusion ""- said OKO.press Councilor and lawyer Marek Szolc.** 

&gt;  ""Today, instead of the principles of legalism, rule of law and  non-discrimination, Tomek's principle of freedom in his house applies.  This is unacceptable, ""adds Szolc.

On the day the arbitration results were announced, I guessed that the following would happen:

Croatia and Slovenia will start bilateral negotiations. They will agree pretty much identical solution to the arbitration ruling. Croatia will present it as a result of bilateral negotiations and Slovenia will present it as forcing Croatia to accept the arbitration.

But before that, Slovenia needs to use every legal way to force Croatia to accept the arbitration or the government will lose face. 

I think we'll wait for that until the final days of Croatian Schengen or Euro negotiations. Slovenia can prolong Croatia joining these institutions, but not forever (year or two at most), it doesn't have the diplomatic pull. Sooner or later the bigger EU countries will force the two to sit and discuss it before the whole thing becomes an embarrassment for the entire Union, like Croatia's EU entry. 

So we'll be stuck in this for another 5 years at least, and in the mean time we'll be creating more bad blood with useless provocations, trials and bullshit.

## Voivods should intervene 

Is it possible to challenge actions of local governments undertaking similar documents?  In the opinion of Marek Szolc, voivodes should take care of this.  ""They supervise the legality of local government activities.  Resolutions that violate the law should be appealed to the courts, ""says Szolc. 

Resolutions against LGBT ideology can be compared to documents adopted by local governments during the constitutional crisis.  Then the voivods appealed to the court, and the Supreme Administrative Court held several times that 

&gt;  this form of expressing one's opinion and declaring a direction of  political action goes beyond the competence of local government. 

 **""We can only guess why voivodes are silent when more than 30 local  government units conduct illegal activities and violate the core of the  system of protection of human and citizen rights in Poland and the  European Union"" - says Marek Szolc.** 

In a situation where the regulatory body does not respond, you can also consider other legal paths.  ""One can imagine a civil claim filed by a resident of a commune who accepts a similar document.  Personal rights would be infringed. 

**However, we must remember that the civil path in Poland is not as effective for protection against discrimination, ""says Szolc.**

A member of the Gowina Agreement saw a ""rainbow ideology"" in the figure of Nicholas and the reindeer

Robert Szatkowski accuses the city of promoting LGBT ""ideology""  


Robert Szatkowski, vice-chairman of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement in Bydgoszcz, shared his insights on Facebook about the figure of St. Mikołaj climbing on the back of the reindeer, which stands at the Bydgoszcz Christmas Market. According to Szatkowski, the figure ""promotes rainbow ideology."" How did the would-be councilor see the bestiality there and additionally compare it to LGBT people whose sexuality implies attraction to other people? They comment on the director of the city's promotion department and a representative of the Equality State Association.  
At the Bydgoszcz Christmas Market appeared, among others figure depicting St. Santa climbing to the back of a reindeer. The deputy chairman of the Jaroslaw Gowin Agreement in Bydgoszcz, Robert Szatkowski, in the figure saw ... references to LGBT people and accused the city of promoting ""rainbow ideology"".  


Szatkowski wrote in the already removed Facebook post: ""When for several years in a row the Town Hall stubbornly served the Bydgoszcz residents Jesus in a stable with the appearance of a starling politician, I thought that Bydgoszcz would be no worse for the image of the city. I was wrong.""  
SEE ALSO  
The Council for Equal Treatment was established in Bydgoszcz! Its composition includes LGBT people  


He added: ""I don't know what's worse in such a case. Is the stupidity and lack of control over what arises in public space, the lack of Christmas taste, and maybe even a conscious consent to the activities of the rainbow ideology, which is not lacking in Bydgoszcz.""  


Łukasz Krupa, the director of the city's promotion department, who co-organized the fair, responded to Szatkowski's words: ""Thousands of fair visitors see Mikołaj who is climbing a reindeer. If anyone sees something wrong in these figures, he probably has a problem.""  


The matter was also commented on by the representative of the Association of Equality, Agata Polcyn, who stated that Szatkowski's statement ""is not worth the attention of any reasonable person"". She added: ""This is a sign of great ignorance. Because Szatkowski is a public figure, his ignorance becomes harmful.""  


This was not the first time in which Robert Szatkowski commented on LGBT people. Earlier, he published on his profile the already famous graphics depicting the family under an umbrella protecting her from the colors of the rainbow. He wrote then: ""I really like this graphic. It explains the essence of the matter very well. I hope, finally, that most people will reach, that the United Right Governments are not a backward backwater, but really a defense of traditional values ​​against the flood of ultraliberal rainbow mud.""  


    Why is this obsession with sex at the right and, for some reason, also bestiality? They accuse us - LGBTQ people - of ""living their own sexuality"", ""bringing everything into sex"" and ""obsessive sexing"", and every time I see words on the internet about ""putting things in the anus"", bringing multidimensional relationships and identities people for sex or for associations with bestiality when someone looks at a figure of St. Nicholas and the reindeer, it is always someone with right-wing views. I agree with Mr. Krupa - if anyone in St. Mikołaj and the reindeer see bestiality, this is not a problem for adults living in loving relationships with the consent of both parties - this is the problem of a person who has these bestial associations. And I think that it would be worth addressing this problem.  


    Anyone can explain to me what's going on? This is quite an interesting topic for deeper research - maybe a student is looking for a topic of thesis? Investigating this strange right wing obsession with other people's sexuality and sexual disorders such as bestiality has the potential for interesting conclusions.

2972,"What a lousy slosh of word porridge.

&gt;Yes, and the Taliban is just fighting for the establishment of an Islamic State in Afghanistan, defending their countrys integrity from the evil imperialist Americans who wish to make them into a puppet state they can extract for resources.

This isn't about the Taliban, IRA or anything else. Those are different topics to dissect. Stick to this topic matter, you obviously have a habit of moving the goal posts to try and validate yourself, ironic you started off with attacking me and my comments, only to show the ""salad"" you indulge yourself in now? Painting everyone with the same brush does not work.

It's ironic you didn't mention ISIS or Al-Qaeda, which would seem ironic and show the massive nonsense in your examples. It also isn't about Al-Qaeda (which I'll add the Turkish state thinks is a totally legit organisation to sponsor in Syria and is contributing to their growth). Nor is it about ISIS, which Turkey once tried to argue aren't terrorists. Get off your high horse. Don't talk about terror, it's not used correctly from your side, it's a buzzword to Turkey.

&gt; Like I said, you can do this kind of mental gymnastics to justify any terrorist organization. Do you believe that terrorists have no cause? That they're merely doing what they're doing out of spite, or evil intent? 

No. It's you who is doing the mental gymnastics. One who addresses the points would be the one who doesn't take such a route. There's no meat to your posts, just ramblings and whataboutism. Mental gymnastics, whataboutism, it's all things you've probably been accused of and now you're projecting. Similar to Turkey accusing Kurds of ethnic cleansing and terrorism. It's the usual projecting your crimes to them.

&gt; Terrorism is a method, not a goal. Terrorism is merely a technique to achieve said goal, a means to an end. 

Terrorism is an act, an act which I'll say again; Turkey is quite obviously committing. It's used on civilians to achieve their political goals, simple to see.

&gt;Just because the Kurds have a right to self-determination, which I think they do, doesn't mean they thereby have the right to butcher civillians. So yeah, saying the means justify the ends (which is, verbatim what you're doing here), is pretty disgusting, and you're trivializing the people who have been killed and terrorized by the PKK. 

The Kurds are not butchering civilians, neither is the PKK. Notice the use of the word butchering, you ripped that statement from my very previous post above, similar to what I mentioned about taking things and rehashing them.

&gt;Two wrongs do not make a right. You realize this is a circular argument right? You're saying that the PKK aren't terrorists, and that they're justified in doing what they're doing because they are threatened. Well doesn't that same logic apply to Turkey then? 

I never said two wrongs make a right, no where does it state that. In fact what you should have understood from my post is you're a hypocrite for considering the PKK terrorists, but having zero callus to call the Turkish state a terror state for what they have undeniably done and still continue to do. If you had actually come with this argument, this conversation would be short. The important thing here is the PKK are not committing terror, or you would point to where in the world the PKK is committing terror on people, while in reality we can see how Turkey is using jihadists to kill civilians, loot and pillage.

&gt;Unlike you I am consistent in my anti-violence stance.

No you are not.

&gt;Turkish repression of Kurds is bad,  
&gt;  
&gt;and the PKK's terrorism is bad.

Clearly these two are not consistent.

&gt;Unlike you, I don't have to stuff in a bunch of word salad to justify my two contradictory positions. 

You just said terrorism is a method. You are dodging the fact Turkey has used it and uses it. Today it commits it using jihadist proxy forces. War crimes, Ethnic cleansing, check, check.

&gt;I also like how, again in your ""us against them"", bigoted worldview, you pretend I have ever justified or excused Turkish discrimination against Kurds. Despite having no evidence of it, in your eyes anyone who disagrees with you is a shill. 

Not relating to me, not going to respond to that, unless you want to highlight where this is us versus them I project. I am talking about important topics here, not your what you think is unfair treatment on reddit. I do not care and I think it's not true one bit.

&gt;I am in favour of Kurdish self-determination, and condemn Turkish repression of the Kurdish people. Kurdish people in Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria are owed fair and free referendums to decide their status, whether that be more autonomy or even outright independence. 

Well, thanks for clarifying a sane position, maybe you think I need to admit to some kind of wrong statement Maybe we're getting somewhere in our conversation. I guess accusing me of terrorist apologism, now suddenly Kurds have some legitimate reasons to their struggle.

It's all nice and dignified to say Kurds deserve this and that, but realistically what you said is achieved via politics and when Kurds have tried that, you know the answer. Like I said, how many political parties have been destroyed since the formation of the HDP (which is the closest thing to representing Kurds in Turkey)? How many were accused of being the PKK, all of them.

It is delusional to assume that they'll get to achieving some kind of self-determination, while all the doors are closed on them and always have been.

&gt;Yes, I am perfectly willing to make personal attacks occasionally at someone who dehumanizes and trivializes civillian deaths. Let alone someone who is incapable, as you have demonstrated, to see people who disagree with him as anything else than bots, or shills. I will admit that I will not refrain from personal attacks when arguing with someone like this, although I will try to keep it at a minimum. 

You can be as violent and insulting as much as you want, not surprised when talking to Turks on this topic.

&gt;Yes, they do. But it's not directly their fault they're there is it? That doesn't make it good, but to ignore that this is a direct consequence of foolish, short-sighted American imperialism is to ignore the entire history of the Syrian Civil War.

3018,"\&gt;  I'm obviously talking about the non-desert areas.

As we said, it's not only desert. You referred to the Po Valley, that's a good example of a non-desert area but that's pretty boring. 

\&gt; Cultural sites is much more than architecture. 

Yes, it includes figurative art and city planning. But still diversity requires different styles.

\&gt; Ah, like that. Well, compared to Europe it's obviously less diverse culturally speaking. It's a continent with dozens of different countries, all with their own customs and cultures.

Well, China is a sort of continent, so it's not unfair comparing China and Europe. 

\&gt;  think that Chinese architecture is as you say, diverse across the country, but more or less stayed the same throughout time. There's more to culture than architecture though, so I'm not convinced that Italy is more diverse than China.

I was referring to architecture and art, not customs, traditions and languages. I doubt that China is more diverse artistically and culturally talking because of this and because its most important cities are basically American megalopolis with some Chinese temples. I don't know about rural villages tho.

\&gt; Lol, honestly Florence and Venice look quite similar to me, the latter just has much more water. HK and Beijing also look similar, but HK has more water.

...

\&gt; Ah you used the wrong word. Odd because your English seems pretty good, you'd think you'd know what uneducated means in English. I think I've been about as polite as you've been.

You started calling me ignorant, that it's true but t's not a good way to carry on a debate. Thanks for English tho, but it's too much Italian based.

\&gt; What cultural superiority did I assume? I think I took a fairly nuanced and balanced position. You're the one who started off with ""Italy is culturally more differentiated"". Now that's assuming a cultural superiority.

I am talking about cultural heritage superiority, not cultural superiority. China could have lots of cultural sites, but large parts of them are lost. You say that I am overestimating this lost, but look at the Chinese cities and the Italian ones. Who best preserved its heritage? 

\&gt; Art, disagree. [Do some reading.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_art) I'd like to know how you came to that conclusion though. Maybe you even have some sources or evidence to back that claim up, for the first time in this thread.

Here we go with impoliteness... I came to that conclusion with the same argument: Chinese cities didn't preserve their heritage and too many archaeological sites were flooded with the Three Gorges Dam. Not a country that particularly care about its heritage.

\&gt; I guess you wanted a ""gotcha"" moment, even if it's irrelevant.

3049,"A lot of innocent people are killed in wars regardless of supposed good intentions. Also, the Iraq war has been extremely controversial from the beginning. For the most part, the population there was fine, he tried to keep the many different groups there from killing each other or running under their religion / ethnicity (his government was secular and pan-Arab nationalist and centre-left economically). He became a problem for the US when he tried invading Kuwait, who is a close US ally. The Gulf War addressed that and there wasn't an issue again until George Bush Jr and his neoconservative foreign policy team decided they wanted to go further than his father did and get rid of Saddam. Since then, there has not only been deaths and destruction from that war but many years of instability, constant issues with the government, the birth of ISIS and it spreading from Iraq to Syria and elsewhere, and now people are mass protesting due to the fucked up economic situation there.

&gt; The 2019 Iraqi protests, also named the Tishreen Revolution[12] and 2019 Iraqi Intifada, are an ongoing series of protests that consisted of demonstrations, marches, sit-ins and civil disobedience. They started on 1 October 2019, a date which was set by civil activists on social media, spreading over the central and southern provinces of Iraq, to protest 16 years of corruption, unemployment and inefficient public services, before they escalated into calls to overthrow the administration and to stop Iranian intervention in Iraq. 

&gt; Starting on 25 October 2019, mass protests took place in many cities in Iraq, including Kerbala, against corruption and a national government that protestors saw as unaccountable for its actions. After the U.S. occupation (2003–11), oligarchs and warlords were perceived to have taken control over Iraq. While the country produces more oil than the United Arab Emirates, the oil revenues were seen by protestors as failing to be spent on maintenance of hospitals and roads. A widely used slogan in this phase of the protests was: ""We want a home land""—reflecting a longing both for a sense of unity and for a self-determined life in dignity.[57]

Quote:

&gt; Journalistic objectivity is a considerable notion within the discussion of journalistic professionalism. Journalistic objectivity may refer to fairness, disinterestedness, factuality, and nonpartisanship, but most often encompasses all of these qualities. First evolving as a practice in the 18th century, a number of critiques and alternatives to the notion have emerged since, fuelling ongoing and dynamic discourse surrounding the ideal of objectivity in journalism.

&gt; Most newspapers and TV stations depend upon news agencies for their material, and each of the four major global agencies (Agence France-Presse (formerly the Havas agency), Associated Press, Reuters and Agencia EFE) began with and continue to operate on a basic philosophy of providing a single objective news feed to all subscribers. That is, they do not provide separate feeds for conservative or liberal newspapers.

3139,"&gt; I didn't draw any better or worse comparisons, and I don't care to. It has nothing to do with whether or not the Confederacy was fighting over slavery. 

Then why did you use that as an example? You clearly thought that somehow the founders should represent the whole country. By that there is not much difference between the founders of the US and CS, only that during the founding of the US slavery was such a fact of life that it wasn't much talked about it.

&gt; They weren't fighting to find other ways to make money. They were fighting to preserve the slavery part. Just because slavery impacted the economy doesn't mean they weren't fighting to protect slavery. 

But then they didn't fight solely for slavery, which is what you said.

&gt; Nobody said that.

You did. You said they singularly fought for slavery and nothing else.

&gt; No, I'm not generalizing that notion. But just because governments can and do frequently lie doesn't mean that should be the default assumption of the Confederacy here. Given the specific circumstances, if the Confederacy had reasons beyond slavery, it would have made all the sense in the world for them to include them as they justified the extraordinary step of secession, especially given that not every single Southerner owned slaves.

Why? Slavery was rather acceptable back then, thus they didn't need ""better justifications"", that would be arguing from a today's standpoint, similar how it was convincing enough for many Europeans to fight in Crusades for Christianity back then. They want to take our property/slaves away is a general enough statement that the most influential people (probably slave owning farmers) would support that. They didn't need to convince the people from the US (since they weren't asking for permission to leave) nor the people who didn't own slaves (because most probably they weren't influential any way). Also, CSA secession wasn't that extraordinary, considering that about 100 years ago the US seceded itself from Britain. The US basically did what the UK failed to do.

Also, I didn't say they lied, I said they don't tell the whole story, thus acting like their official documents are somehow the reasoning for everything is rather naive. What if for whatever reason they wouldn't have even mentioned slavery as an official reason (let's say they somehow cared what future people would think of them)? Do you want to tell me that you wouldn't try to argue that they still mainly wanted independence because of slavery, since that wouldn't have been the official reason?

&gt; If the contention is that they left out these other important reasons- what were they? And why were they left out?

Because that is usually the case. More complex reasons are usually left out of official and public explanation. That's the same way how the official reasons of many wars in Europe were because of religion, while in reality they were mainly wars for power.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/e93865/77_years_ago_the_polish_government_addressed_a/fai7q4j/,CDWEBI,1576101589

3182,"You are correct in one regard: As I said in my original comment, there is a spectrum of literacy (people are literate to varying degrees).

Where you are wrong is your statement that functional literacy in the US is shockingly high compared to most of the developed world.

According to the statistic you have provided, approximately 32 million Americans are functionally literate (out of roughly 325 Million Americans), a fact I do not dispute. However,  7.5 million Germans are also functionally illiterate (out of roughly 80 million Germans). That means that 9.375% of Germans are functionally illiterate, while 9.846% of Americans are illiterate. This means the US has a comparable functional literacy rate to Germany (The US has a higher rate than the German figure, but it is a difference of half a percent, I would say it is within a margin of error).

This also holds true for France, who also has a rate of 9%, and Switzerland, who has a rate of about 9.5%.

While it is true that the US has a problem with functional illiteracy, the rate of functional illiteracy is remarkably similar in both Western Europe and the US. 

Bringing us back to the original comment that I replied to, he/she stated  “US poor masses neither can nor want to read”. The only conclusion that is supported by the data is that this is conception is only as true in the United States as it is in Western Europe.

3260,"&gt; First, it's a little different when that Vice President is one of the Founding Fathers of a brand new country describing the reasons for its founding. 

Weren't most if not all the Founding Fathers of the US slave holders? So, because the founding fathers of the US didn't put that much emphasis on slavery, they are somehow better than the founding fathers of the CS?

&gt; And I'm not saying every last person in the Confederacy only cared about slavery, but that is all the leaders who founded it actually cared about.

You kind of did though.

&gt; Let's go to the Articles of Secession from various Confederate states.

I'm not sure how that matters. Official statements are often not the truth or not the whole truth. Brittan officially attacked China because China somehow harassed British opium traders or something along those lines. Most people agree that those weren't the motivations but the pretext to wage war and get the UK into a better geopolitical situation.

In regards to Georgia, even though the underlying theme is slave heavy one can quite easily see the more socio-economic reasoning. **They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property, and by the use of their power in the Federal Government have striven to deprive us of an equal enjoyment of the common Territories of the Republic.** The real underlying theme is that, the south was economically reliant on slaves and removal of slaves would cause economic hardship. That is quite different than simply saying they want slaves for the sake of it.

&gt; Preserving slavery wasn't just one of the goals of the Confederacy, it was their reason for being. Any other goal was just a drop in the bucket

Again, that is just the usually ""the people I dislike are one-dimensional beings"". You act like official statements cannot be false or not tell the whole story. One of the many official stories the US likes or at least liked to tell why it wages so much wars around the world is because they want to spread democracy. So is that true now? 

Russia officially said it annexed Crimea because of the wishes of the people in Crimea. Is that somehow the whole truth now because it is official? Sure most Crimeans prefer being part of Russia, but it's surely not the only reason Russia did that, since we all know Russia has not a good track record of caring about democracy. But hey since it is official and does on the surface level seem to be true, it has to be the sole reason. That is the logic of your reasoning.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/e93865/77_years_ago_the_polish_government_addressed_a/fahw3za/,CDWEBI,1576094713

In fact I believe there is a scientific study done that said that the number of Jews killed during WW2 was so much so in such a short amount of time that it has permanently altered the DNA of living descendants in some way.

3439,"I lived in Germany for about 18 months (11 months in 12. Klasse, and then 5 months for a semester in university). 

It was quite apparent to me that there was a flaw in the way fascism/Third Reich, propaganda, and the Holocaust were taught to the youngest generation. 

Don’t get me wrong—I think that the elements of the German education system that I observed covered the topics quite well and were extremely comprehensive. These are significant elements of German history/social issues lessons. 

My observation was that the schoolchildren were just plain oversaturated. Seemingly from day one of Gymnasium elements of Third Reich history were incorporated into lessons. There’s a constant, drumming reminder of the past atrocities. It’s worked into TV programs, museum exhibits, books, etc, etc etc. Schoolchildren have to attend special workshops and visit two concentration camps in their course of education. My village had *Stolpersteine* in front of each building where Jews had resided or worked. If Germans travel outside of Germany, it doesn’t take long before Godwin’s law takes effect and someone brings up Hitler/Third Reich/Holocaust/etc. 

On one hand, it’s vital that there’s a constant reminder. I’m of Polish descent and ~60% of my Polish ancestors living during the time were directly killed by German action (SS, Gestapo, and Wehrmacht). I grew up hearing stories from “the other side”,  which were sickening stories of brutality and callous disregard for human life or culture or dignity. Internally I was screaming *fucking good that this is beaten into you*, but I began to see the...uh...”toll”...it was taking on youth learning about this. Am afraid that the oversaturation will work against the whole goal of the lessons. 

These education measures manifest themselves as guilt. But children born in the mid 1990s—2000s are, what, four generations separated? They feel that they had nothing to do with it and wouldn’t do it anyway, and neither were their parents or grandparents involved. 

I think the natural reaction when oversaturated and told to feel guilty for something you weren’t directly involved in is to either just shut it all out (most common reaction I observed among Oberstufe students...it was pitiful how little they paid attention during such lessons and workshops) or in extreme cases, totally snap and flip the other way. 

Now, in rereading what I wrote above, I realize that I used a lot of “they”—there’s some generalization here, but I don’t think it’s too bad. Please let me know if you find the generalization egregious in any way and I’ll edit to fix.","USA (Lived in DE, also citizen of PL)",/r/europe/comments/e93865/77_years_ago_the_polish_government_addressed_a/fah6bj2/,Superiorem,1576080128

3523,"&gt;But what about climate? Labour have internalised the need for the huge programme of public investment necessary to keep temperature rise anywhere close to targets.

I think Labour's plans are good in parts. Others are terrible. For example, they want to fund the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon, despite it costing several times as much per KWH as nuclear power, output dropping to zero 4 times a day, and the requirement for flexible backup power to run most of the time.

Likewise they plan to massively expand wind power. Last weekend wind generated so much power overnight that the UK had a surplus people had to be paid to use (the wind generators still get paid their subsidy, though). Conservative plans will already mean the UK will frequently end up wasting power, Labour's plans will mean that will happen even more.

The Energy Research Partnership (which was set up by the Labour government in the mid 00s) has calculated that wind and solar can only reduce UK emissions to 180 grams of CO2 per KWH, whereas nuclear can get our emissions down below 50 grams. As a result I'm in favour of nuclear.

The former chief adviser on energy to the government, David MacKay, said in his final interview a few years ago:

&gt;“Then if you ask what is the optimal amount of wind and solar to add in then the answer is going to be almost zero,” he said. “I love wind turbines – they are the cathedrals of the modern age – but they are a waste of money if you have a low carbon solution that gets you through the winter … because when the wind blows you are going to have to either turn them down or something else down that you have already paid for like nuclear or CCS.”

I haven't looked at them in depth, but too many of Labour's promises don't add up. They talk of businesses investing in green energy, at the same time they plan to increase their taxes and nationalise energy assets at below market rates. They promise a massive increase in solar which is pretty counter productive in the UK (because solar produces little in winter and nothing on winter evenings, when demand is highest, and produces most on summer days, when demand is lowest).

&gt;I'd have a bit more confidence in the right's ability to meaningfully deal with climate change if they actually deployed any of the market based solutions. But where's the fuel duty escalation? Where's the kerosine tax? Where are all of the externality corrections? I suspect they're ideologically at odds with dealing with an international, intergenerational externality almost by definition

Possibly they are. But the fuel duty escalator I think is a good example of what's possible. Labour abandoned the escalator back in 2000 because of the fuel protests, France has recently done the same. I don't think the public will accept some of the extreme changes necessary, which is why I believe only technological solutions to climate change will work. We can decarbonise electricity with nuclear, because for roughly the same price the public can get a reliable supply. We can decarbonise transport because electric cars are becoming competitive for most (if you count in the tax breaks they get). There is reluctance and delay with governments (not just in the UK, but worldwide) to tackle the difficult issues around climate change, and I don't think Labour would be any different.",,/r/europe/comments/e947s7/the_dirtiest_uk_election_ever_here_are_some_of/fagvqf9/,WhiteSatanicMills,1576072692

Now first at point blank you are right in saying the UK and USA did not join the war for humanitarian reasons (sort of) and depending on how you define it never really had that as there only goal. Funnily enough however very few people would claim that and considering the situation britain and France found themselves in in 1939 it would have been exceedingly strange to do so.

Britain and France joined the war to curtail German expansionism that is not a selfish reason to join the war nor is it selfless its just a reason. The Germans embarked on a period of gross imperialistic and conquest driven expansion of Europe which yes did attract their attention.  The UK's continental ambitions ironically were practically non existent and we can see they went to great lengths to avoid conflict with Germany. It's strange to paint the British as the bad guy for finally getting involved or as selfish people when they continued the war. It is true they wanted the continuation of the polish state and the preservation of these various nations sovereignties but we would argue that isnt the most selfish reason.

Now I won't lie I find it hard to address your claims becuase they are quite honestly very fucking weird so to move on to an easier one. The allies were reluctant to act to curtail the holocaust but as is stated above this was much more due to strategic necessity rather then sheer apathy. The problem with bombing railways is they are exceedingly easy to bomb and if you try to bomb the camps infrastructure its very possible you could just attack the targets you are trying to save rather then the ones you are trying to destroy. Sadly this caution led to a little too much holding back with horrifically tragic results but the Allies made the prevention of the holocaust and the destruction of the German Nazi state down to the fucking roots one of its top priorities.",,/r/europe/comments/e93865/77_years_ago_the_polish_government_addressed_a/fagw2pr/,AlmondAnFriends,1576072966

Usually the new 'parasitic' building is deliberately designed to look as visually and stylistically different to the host structure as posible to communicate the design philosophie outwardly.

A good example is to have living units attached high up on a commercial skyscraper.

3625,"It’s two related reasons. The main issue is EU common agricultural policy, which gives western (namely French) farmers larger subsidies for the same produce than Eastern European farmers. So they are half way protesting that (although everyone in government agrees with the farmers that this is unfair treatment and are trying to protect our farmers).

The other issue, is that since EU understands that they are being somewhat unfair to EE countries, they allow the countries with below average EU CAP subsidies to add additional agricultural subsidies on their own, I.e state aid to cover the difference between EU subsidies. Estonia is allowed to give further 15 million euros a year to farmers. Government promised it, but in the 2020 budget it was only 5 million.

3650,"&gt; Yes. It was called the ""Attlee consensus"". By the time it ended in 1979 the UK had gone from being the largest car producer in Europe to being behind Germany, France and Italy. The UK car industry had been nationalised into a rump that had to assemble kits of parts from Japan because they could no longer afford to design their own models. The UK had gone from producing more than 40% of world ships to 3%, with empty order books for the future. Steel production had declined when it had boomed everywhere else. The UK, which had been richer than the Western European average since the 17th century, had declined to 80% of the Western European average.

Hmm it's almost as though those governments had to deal with the final collapse of an empire, that used to span over a fourth of the landmass on the planet, to not even the biggest country in it's region... 

If you ask me the UK would've sunken a lot deeper if it hadn't been for the Attlee consensus. 

You mention Germany and the like, but you realise that the Attlee consensus wasn't just a purerly British phenomenon, right? All of Western Europe was dominated by social democrat governments and conservative governments that enacted Keynesian economic policy. You fell behind Germany, but that wouldn't have happened nearly as quickly without the Wirtschaftswunder. 

Similarly, all European countries abandoned Keynesian economics and started adopting monetarist and neo-classical economics when stagflation hit the Western world. This is no proof that the policies enacted in the time before stagflation were all a waste, it merely suggests that Keynesian economics wasn't viable anymore when it hit or simply weren't the right policies to be effective against this new scenario.",,/r/europe/comments/e947s7/the_dirtiest_uk_election_ever_here_are_some_of/fagolja/,tiisje,1576065757

3657,"Those 'swimming pool 'type arguments don't even follow any basic logic that leads to their implicit conclusion.

They then stripped them of every right imaginable and put them in slave labor camps where they were worked to death and slept in filth-riddled bunks next to each other with high rates of disease as a result of atrocious conditions, which is a part that even Holocaust deniers don't challenge ( The extreme, uncaring slave labor and death from widespread disease ).

3688,"&gt;when so little American history is taught

Yeah, I'm pretty sure Americans are taught plenty of American history in their classes, at least in half-decent schools that actually abide by the approved curriculum. I'm not American, but I am using Reddit and American websites for years and have American friends where they speak of which historical events they've been taught. Maybe I'm wrong, so I'll just leave an open offer to make a thread in any of Reddit's 'Ask an American' subs inquiring whether they learn as 'little' American history as they do Holocaust history.

&gt;no other museum trip will be ever offered, let alone required.

Can you provide me a citation on the idea that American kids aren't offered any other museum trips, or that the Holocaust trip is somehow ""more mandatory"" than any other external activity that is part of the children's curriculum and important for finals?",Israel,/r/europe/comments/e93865/77_years_ago_the_polish_government_addressed_a/fagoyae/,Pingerim,1576066174

3716,"&gt;What the comment actually says is that Poland is more sexist, and that therefore men are more trapped in traditional roles, and suffer more from toxic masculinity.

Again, if that were the case then why is Poland higher than much more traditional countries such as Russia and Ukraine? ""Traditional roles"" are undesirable no question there, however blaming those as an umbrella term should never be a detractor from tackling the actual issues. And sadly it is.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  For example, take your point 1 and 2. These are examples of men being forced into the role of provider 

If that were the case than doesn't it mean the causes of this role aren't really ""traditional"" as of now and groups claiming to fight these gender roles are doing the exact opposite? The issue of family courts and alimony has always been labelled as a ""men's rights activists thing"" and people fighting for it have been branded as sexist. The very same groups that claim to fight against ""toxic masculinity"" have fought against joint custody law proposals in the US for example. ""Masculinity"" is obviously not what's causing these laws then.

The same happens with the way workers are treated. Every fight for fair treatment in the workplace as a gendered issue always talks about women's treatment in the workplace, despite men usually getting the short end of the stick here.

Both these cases are of modern causes, modern ideologies and modern movements in the fight for human rights. How can we call these issues ""traditional"" then? If the issue is men being mistreated in the workplace then we talk about men being mistreated in the workplace. If the issue is biased family courts then we talk about biased family courts. That way we deal with the issue regardless of the cause and whether it's ""traditional"" or ""modern"". Using ""traditional sexism"" as an umbrella term instead is a warranty that society will remain unaware and inactive on these issues.",,/r/europe/comments/e91jcy/male_suicides_to_female_suicides_ratio_in_europe/fagjf1z/,TheSpaceDuck,1576058232

3747,"I'm just going to put this here to show some examples of arguments they use:

One big one is the fact that some gas chambers had wooden doors. And as every high schooler knows, wooden doors let through gas because they don't seal properly. So it is impossible for a gas chamber to function with a wooden door. But if you go beyond high school logic you realise that actually you can definitely create a seal with a wooden door. Just because your wooden door in your barn is shitty doesn't mean they all are. And even then, if you have a large gas chamber where you put in a large amount of people then a bit of gas seeping out is fine, just as long as the door isn't wide open, there is still not enough clean air coming in to save you. In the US they had 1 person gas chamber execution booths. Here gas seeping out was a much bigger problem so that is why they had very good sealing doors made of metal.

This really shows what happens when you take a puzzle piece and examine it with a microscope outside of the bigger picture until it makes no sense. Yes, wooden doors generally aren't good at creating seals, but they definitely can be 'good enough'. None of this argument explains what actually happened to the jews that vanished once they got to the camp. But it doesn't have to because that is not the point.

Another one is that concentration camps weren't that bad because they had swimming pools. Yes, it is true that there was a concentration camp with a swimming pool. This swimming pool was mainly used for the guards but also sometimes to reward the good prisoners who ratted out others or something. This was a converted water storage pool, so not really a big affair. It was basically an accidental swimming pool. There was a pool of water, they added a ladder, that is it.

Note how the swimming pool doesn't even do anything to discredit the holocaust. It isn't as if swimming in a pool makes you immune to Zyklon B gas. The swimming pool argument is a clear example of how holocaust denial doesn't have to make sense. All that argument is supposed to do is make you go ""yeah, jews didn't have it so bad. They were just normal prisoners of war"". I don't think people were complaining about whether or not concentration camps had enough swimming pools. I think most of the complaints centered around the mass murdering of innocent people thing. But that doesn't matter. The goal isn't to disprove the holocaust. The goal is to create doubt, and use that doubt as a tool to create hate.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/e93865/77_years_ago_the_polish_government_addressed_a/fagjkut/,Leprecon,1576058494

As far as I don't like Bibi, he actually backed this law partially (""Polish death camps"" were not Polish actually, here I agree with the law). Controversy was becasue of ""...accusing Poles as genocide perpetrators"", because some of them actually were serving Nazis and commiting war crimes, and saying so would put man for 3 years in prison.

3763,"&gt;And most likely Boris will win once again because the voters in the UK seem to absolutely love being conned

If he does win it will be because voters in the UK don't want a socialist government that will try to turn the clock back to the failed policies of the 70s. Labour is promising to take UK public spending up to the level of Germany or Denmark and also promising only businesses and ""the rich"" will pay extra. 

Currently corporate taxes amount to 1.9% of GDP in the US, 2% in Germany, 2.2% in France, 3% in the UK. Labour's plan is to raise them to 5% of GDP in the UK. They tell people that this will make the rich pay, and won't affect most people. But most people work for companies that will have to find a lot more money to pay the tax, they have pensions that have shares in companies etc. 

Labour's plans would bring financial disaster to the UK. That's why so many people will be voting for the Tories (hopefully enough). I've voted Tory most of my life, but given a choice between Brexit and a moderate Labour party, I'd choose Labour. But a Labour party promising a massive increase in spending accompanied by massive tax rises on businesses? The UK already has an enormous trade deficit because we spend more than we produce.

You know...

Vampires really jelled in, I guess, Eastern Europe.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire

&gt; The notion of vampirism has existed for millennia. Cultures such as the Mesopotamians, Hebrews, Ancient Greeks, Manipuri and Romans had tales of demons and spirits which are considered precursors to modern vampires. Despite the occurrence of vampiric creatures in these ancient civilizations, the folklore for the entity known today as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th-century southeastern Europe,[1] when verbal traditions of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. In most cases, vampires are revenants of evil beings, suicide victims, or witches, but they can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire. Belief in such legends became so pervasive that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even public executions of people believed to be vampires.[18] 

Then my impression is that the British kind of popularized it via *Dracula* and similar and spread it via written media to the US.

In the US, vampires entered movies.

I'm pretty sure that it was the US that spread it to Japan, which developed the first *Castlevania* in the mid-1980s, where Konami developed titles in the series for some decades.

Then it looks like starting in 2010, Konami started working with the Spanish developer MercuryStream that is apparently doing the current series...and it's back in Europe again.

3872,"I was a bit confused myself and as not everyone can be bothered to click on links:

To just say what is behind those links, with a little bit of context. (tl;dr at the bottom)

On January 1st 1942, 26 nations (not all of them on January 1st, but within the next few days) under the leadership of FDR signed the first contract that used the phrase ""United Nations"". It was in its essence a contract vowing to continue the fight against the Axis Powers. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;(1) Each Government pledges itself to employ its full resources, military or economic, against those members of the Tripartite Pact and its adherents with which such government is at war.  
&gt;  
&gt;(2) Each Government pledges itself to cooperate with the Governments signatory hereto and not to make a separate armistice or peace with the enemies.  
&gt;  
&gt;The foregoing declaration may be adhered to by other nations which are, or which may be, rendering material assistance and contributions in the struggle for victory over Hitlerism.

The UN claims that this was the first step towards what then became the United Nations. However, I really just see the name as a link. It is a great example of the importance of wording. This whole thing could have been called ""Vow to defeat our enemies"", and in that case, nobody would show any interest. FDR pushed for the term ""United Nations"", and that not only blazed the trail for a real organisation after the war but it also makes FDR's role appear more important. 

Moreover, because they called themselves ""United Nations"" and not ""a bunch of countries really sick of fascism"" Poland had the opportunity to ""address"" them. This is an important point as the League of Nations had practically ceased to be at this point. (And has never been that powerful in the first place. We claim that the UN has no real power and doesn't do anything that is of practical relevance. Nevertheless, compared to the influence of the League of Nations the UN is almost a world government.)

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: 

The United Nations mentioned in this document are not the organisation ""United Nation"" that exist nowadays.

3921,"&gt;“They were saying that they reckon there’s a butter mountain in Europe, that there’s a grain mountain in Europe, and that Europe is the worst thing that ever happened to the world, that they’d be much better trading with America because they’re far more honest,” he recounts.

You don't have to leave the EU to trade with the US; the two are not mutually-exclusive.  Less than five years ago, we were looking at a world where Brexit could not have been avoided and TTIP could have happened, an environment in which it was likely that all parties involved would have done more trade with each other.

That world was one that the UK was generally-expected to be more-prosperous in.

And while I agree that the agricultural subsidy situation in the EU is both economically-inefficient and has been disadvantageous to the UK, it's also a situation that is and has continued to be addressed internally to the EU without need for the UK to bail out of the system.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy

&gt;The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the agricultural policy of the European Union. It implements a system of agricultural subsidies and other programmes. It was introduced in 1962 and has undergone several changes since then to reduce the cost (from 73% of the EU budget in 1985 to 37% in 2017[1]) and to also consider rural development in its aims.

-

&gt; Oversupply and its redistribution
&gt;
&gt;To perpetuate the viability of European agriculture in its current state, the CAP-mandated demand for certain farm produce is set at a high level compared with demand in the free market (see § CAP as a form of state intervention). This leads to the European Union purchasing millions of tonnes of surplus output every year at the stated guaranteed market price, and storing this produce in large quantities (leading to what critics have called 'butter mountains' and 'milk lakes'), before selling the produce wholesale to developing nations.[73] In 2007 in response to a parliamentary written question the UK government revealed that over the preceding year the EU Public Stock had amassed ""13,476,812 tonnes of cereal, rice, sugar and milk products and 3,529,002 hectolitres of alcohol/wine"", although the EU has claimed this level of oversupply is unlikely to be repeated. This point was actually proven in January 2009, where the EU had a store of 717,810 tonnes of cereals, 41,422 tonnes of sugar and a 2.3 million hectolitre 'wine lake', showing that the stocks had diminished dramatically.[73][74] 

Finally, some of that agricultural aid effectively benefits poorer EU members like Bulgaria.  And were there to be no funds in the form of agricultural subsidies, my guess is that there would be greater aid in another form.

It's your own god damn official stats on this conflict. What shit do you smoke for you to be oblivious to this and talk so arrogantly? Blame your nerves heating up on your own ignorance.

Not only that, most of those deaths are Kurdish civilians and the barbaric way they were attacked by Turkey for simply being who they are. Lets not kid anyone here. 3000 villages, homes and including towns were not destroyed, millions of Kurds did not flee to Europe, some remaining in Istanbul for no reason. They were literally barred from going back, they fled to larger cities. Read a book for once in your life on the topic.

It happened again in 2017, it's happening now in Syria on the Syrian Kurds. You can't deny reality, maybe you can lie to yourself, but nobody believes your lies.

The UK is similar to a nation like Spain, where differing groups are united under one crown, not to a nation like a federal republic like Germany or America. I've never **once** stated that you don't have regional culture in Germany - not ONCE have I stated that, I'm simply stating the truth backed up by BOTH OF OUR SOURCES that not only is it not as keenly felt, but it is a *regional* culture, not a *national* culture like Scottish, or Basque are a *national culture*. You have to think of the UK like an outdated monarchy like the Austro-Hungarian empire, lots of countries all ruled under one monarchy. 

Look at your comment, how condescending it is, how few points you have made, how it isn't supported by even your own sources. You have an opinion, and you're kicking and screaming that other people don't agree with it. You love to throw around this ""typical British"" thing like the Swedish guy was, but you're just showing all the worst arrogance and sneering attitude that people hate no matter what country you come from.

And **no** by the way - this shows how little your understanding of British culture is, ""Mainlander"" is not used to feel  superior over Europeans on the mainland, it is used to feel closer to them, as many English people often state ""We're not Europeans we're our own thing"" but I feel like we're only 26 miles off the coast, we're not our own thing, we're just European islanders, whilst the mainland has European mainlanders. Sicilians or Corsicans would also be Islanders. Get it? Its not a condescending term, its a term to say ""we're part of Europe, we're just off the coast, not floating in the middle of the Atlantic like some people on both sides seem to think"".

You have completely the wrong idea about me and my ideas, but hell, you keep thinking whatever you need to think to feel secure about yourself. Let me know when a part of Germany feels so serious that they actually *hold* an independence referendum. And no, not have a tiny minority party with like 10-20% independence support, actually hold a serious referendum about leaving Germany like Scotland did. That is how different people feel here, just like Catalonia. Germany doesn't have that. Cool, Bavarians have strong accents and strong dialects. But they're still speaking a form of German.

But if you expect the Serbs to cooperate with Mr.'Snake' and Haradinaj brothers, you're delusional - just as some Serbs North of Ibar are, believing that they are better off by blindly isolating from any cooperation. There is a huge discourse about this here in Serbia, and it will erupt in some time soon. Vucic is a disgrace to our country, and i close my eyes and try to deafen my ears when i see him speaking with some foreign politician about something. But this is my problem and the problem of people here. The people are also afraid of your new president, who is openly using the Albanian flag in official meetings, which is kinda inviting for fear of Greater Albania. I am not saying this is what frightens me personally (i am not from Kosovo either), but many people will be rubbed off the wrong way.

The pathetic part is, that the criminal syndicate, yours and ours, work together like the best partners ever. You can bet that all tension building in the past 5 years is the result of their mutual agreements. We are both doing nothing to reconcile with each other.

4009,"&gt; You’re telling me the English &amp; the Germans have more historical sites than the Greeks who existed since 5000 BC?

If you've ever had a look at the tectonic plates in Europe, you will see that Greeece sits on one of the most active fault lines on the Eurasian tectonic plate. Its history is littered by earthquakes. The very first Greek and European civilisation, the Minoan civilisation, was ended by a disastrous series of natural calamities that started with the violent eruption and subsequent collapse of the volcano on the island of Santorini, which was followed by a tsunami that destroyed all coastal cities on the Greek archipelagos and Crete.

Germany and England need to worry about floodings at most.

&gt; And how the hell does England &amp; Germany have more historical sites than India &amp; Russia?

Russia at least is justified in that it was for a long long time a sparsely populated and underdeveloped land. Most Russian cities emerged from obscurity only after the golden horde invasion. Moscow was little more than a fortress when Ivan the terrible proclaimed himself as tsar and that was in the middle of the 16th century, when cities like Trier, Cologne or London had already a millennium of history.

As for natural sites, the Russians are not exactly a prime example of care for the preservation of nature. Neither is India for its historical sites.

Having a worthy site in your territory does not grant you automatic enlist in UNESCO. You need to produce a dossier that demonstrates that you can take care of that site. Germany lost one of its sites (Dresden and the Elbe valley) because the city of Dresden chose to build a modern bridge for car traffic on the river Elbe that ruined (for UNESCO) the integrity of the site and its skyline.

Wrong. Moscow was already considered the ""3rd Rome"" by many scholars, artists, and clergymen in Europe &amp; the Middle East by the 13th century before the fall of Constantinople. 

Also geography favors ""historical sites"" and the geography of Russia and India both dwarfs Western Europe. We always talk about Moscow but what about Astrakhan? It was the capital city of the Golden Horde. And what about Vladivostok? It was an important city in Manchurian China for centuries until the Russians conquered it. 

Yet for some reason these historical places are excluded yet every tiny ass village in Germany is included.

4075,"This is so disconnected from reality, it's quite frankly amazing.

&gt;For one, we should start an information campaign to disprove the lies that people traffickers spread that everyone who gets to Europe gets free money, free car and a free house. We should also inform them that to get a job you either need to be unique specialist or you need to know the local language. This is something that would do good to everyone - fewer people would come to Europe, only to be later disappointed that they cannot find place on the labour market or that they are poor.

So your plan is to do that in every single african country and most of the middle east ? Good luck with that. And as someone already mentionned, you don't realize that most of those people don't care about ""handouts"". Any job in black they can have in Europe will pay 10 to 100 times better than anything in their country. Not to mention it's massively safer.

&gt;Second, we should have a common EU biometric database to prevent identity fraud among asylum seekers.

I don't necessarily disagree with that, but that's the kind of things that would never pass our democratic process.

&gt;Third, once this system is in place, we should give these people a free ticket home.

This is where you (and so many others) really don't understand how any of this work. You can't just put people on a plane and drop them where they come from. The target country has to agree to it first. Otherwise it's quite literally an act of war.

&gt;Four, failing to comply with and order to leave the country should result in detention until the person is put on a plane home.

We are already doing that, but it's the same problem as above. And yes, while we could technically work around it, it would clearly be some form of neocolonialism, where we force sovereign countries to take people that don't want to live there back. Again, I don't personally have a problem with that, but it's a nightmare for implement to pass something like that trough our democracies.

4106,"&gt;Well, simple question: Did they surgically (or with other treatments like radiation) have their cancer removed?

Because no, you don't cure cancer with chemo. Chemo will always be administered in combination with another treatment UNLESS the cancer is considered already advanced enough (stage 4) that surgery won't help anymore.

This ""unless"" part should be all the evidence you need. If chemotherapy could cure cancer on it's own, stage 4 cancer couldn't be the absolute death sentence it is. How can any cancer be terminal from the get go, if there is the chance (even 1%) to cure it.

Stage 4 means the cancer has grown so much neither chemo, meds or surgery can help. No treatment can guarantee you a 100% chance of preventing cancer from coming back anyway, either your body fights off the remaining cancer cells, or another cancer develops. Chemo is no different. Tumors can be removed in a variety of ways, and chemo is most definitely one of them, specially in places and situations where the tumor is inoperable. Chemo can reduce tumors to the point your body can sort it out, and while it's probably not as safe as straight up surgery, saying treating cancer with chemo only without the need or possibility for surgery means another cancer will inevitably develop is still flat out wrong. I mean, what would be even the point of even saying your cancer is cured when you know it's coming back sometime later? Makes absolutely no sense at all.

&gt;Edit: I just noticed that maybe i haven't been clear enough in my first post. I didn't mean that cancer is incurable. But chemo itself won't cure cancer. The cases where cancer can be cured, chemo therapy is administered because it extends the life of the patients if the cancer was not entirely removed (it delays the cancers noticeable return) and because it can make removal of the cancer easier.

Chemo is never meant to extend the life of the patient if the doctors know it can't be cured. It's just a waste of time, resources and quite frankly it's so horrible in itself that it's just not worth it the vast majority of the time.

4113,"  ""Populism is easier to succeed in a political environment where  pluralism does not exist,"" says populism researcher Ben Stanley. 

**Tomasz Sawczuk: What is populism?** 

**Ben Stanley:** It is a kind of ideology according to which the basis of politics is the conflict between the elites and the people.  Added to this is the moral dimension - right is always on the side of the people.  The people are authentic, and the political elites are by definition inauthentic, corrupt, unworthy of their position. 

**And if the elites are really corrupt?** 

It happens.  Sometimes the people are also corrupt. 

I think the division into elites and people does not come from nowhere.  You can understand why some people think that way.   The easiest way to describe the complex world of politics is to say  that there is a ""caste"" or ""arrangement"" that controls everything.

  Orbán.  New model   
  leadership in Europe   
  PLN 33.60 

**These are a few basic issues.**  **Some say that populism is an anti-pluralism position.** 

This is a logical conclusion by definition of populism.   If we assume that the people are homogeneous, the elites are  homogeneous, and the people are right - then pluralism becomes  suspicious. 

**In political debates, populism is said to describe complex matters in a simplified way.** 

One can say that this attitude is correlated with populism, but it is not closely related to it.   I am able to give numerous examples of politicians who are not  populists but use simple language and communicate with voters using  simplifying slogans.  This way of communicating with people is attractive to populists, but as such it is not populism. 

**Some say that the concept of populism is simply vague and useless.** 

It used to be this way.  The concept of populism was poorly defined.   When I started researching populism 15 years ago, every scientific  article on populism began with a ritual apology for not having a good  definition of populism.  During this time, however, something like a working consensus appeared.  Not all researchers accept the same definition, but we have a common ground of agreement. 

There was another problem instead.  Over the past few years there has been a huge increase in interest in the topic.  Everyone writes about populism, often having little idea about it.  That is why, again, the belief that this is a fashionable concept that does not explain anything has become popular.  And that's not true. 

📷

**Is populism cool or not?** 

As the subject of the study the most \[ *laughs* \]. 

**And as a political position?** 

Some say it is pure evil.  For me, populism is a kind of ferment that is needed in democracy.  As a liberal and pluralist, I am convinced that populist policy is nowhere.  But I understand why populism exists. 

**Why?** 

 Research conducted in recent years shows that populism responds to the  need among people to understand the world of politics just as populists  present it. 

**So there is a demand for populism?** 

 What's more, some people hypothesize that in a sense we are all  populists or we could become them in the right conditions - if this  populism, which is deep inside us, is well articulated by political  leaders. 

&gt;  Populism is a kind of ideology according to which the basis of politics  is the conflict between the elites and the people - and the right is  always on the side of the people.   
  Ben Stanley 

**Can populism improve democracy?** 

I'm not sure what to think about it.  I look at populism negatively because of what is happening now in the world.  Populism has a bad effect on our policy.   However, it may prove useful in the sense that when it appears in the  public sphere, political elites begin to devote more energy to  formulating new ideas and seeking solutions to social problems that they  were previously inclined to ignore. 

**It's probably not in Poland?** 

Exactly.   It can also be said that in Poland the left was able to effectively  bring into the debate some issues that were previously ignored - I do  not know if this is due to populism. 

 However, in some cases it may be that when a populist party appears, it  forces competitors to think about whether they represent society well.  The problem arises when a wave of populism arises - and this is beginning to gain popularity in many countries simultaneously. 

**Is populism dangerous?** 

It can be dangerous.  First of all, because it is a denial of pluralism.  In democratic societies, people's opinions cannot be reduced to the uniform will of the people. 

Populism is therefore always a threat to minorities.  In populism, the concept of people means a majority that excludes minorities.   Some are allowed to identify with the people, but others cannot  consider themselves representatives of the people, because of views,  origin or beliefs - ""people"" are never the same as the general public.  For example, there are real and untrue Poles. 

**Is the concept of populism an ideological stick of liberals for politicians they don't like?** 

It happens.  I would say that this is a concept of populism from the weekly The Economist.   When I read editions of the magazine from a few years ago, the word  populism almost always refers to party policy that did something  unreasonably or contrary to its editorial line.  Today, the authors of the weekly use this term more cautiously. 

**Can you be a liberal populist?** 

I often hear about it, but I've never seen it.  Since liberalism presupposes social pluralism that must be respected, it cannot be populist. 

 I think that when people talk about liberal populism, they often mean  economic liberals who think that in politics and economics everything is  simple - just let the market operate freely. 

**Some say that Emmanuel Macron is a populist.** 

To be honest, I don't know where it comes from.  His style of expression and expression seem to be rather a negation of this thesis. 

 One of the problems with populism is that some people use the term as  it is accepted in science, while others just want to discredit the word  with an opponent, as it was used 20 years ago.  Not only liberals use this concept to discredit and make fun of opponents. 

**And should populists be called populists?**  **Isn't  it that when we speak in this way, we only help them say that - yes -  they are the people and we are apparently the elites?** 

It used to be that nobody wanted to be called a populist.  It has changed over the past five years.  Many politicians now believe that you can talk about yourself in this way.  Marine Le Pen has done it even before.   Nigel Farage says that since he is to be described as a man who stands  on the side of the people - please, he can be called a populist.  Identifying politicians as populists is therefore risky, especially if the term is not used very carefully. 

I think, however, that you should name things by name.  When we are dealing with a vivid example of populism, one should not be afraid of using words.",,/r/europe/comments/e90t0v/kaczyński_has_just_one_view_hes_right/faft54l/,bm52oc,1576031227
4114,"**Who is your favorite populist?** 

I still have sentiment for Andrzej Lepper.  This is an example of a man who really thought the way he said.  When I look at PiS politicians, I wonder if they are truly convinced that politics is divided into elites and people?  When I look at Jarosław Kaczyński, I see a man who perceives the world in a completely different way.  Kaczyński understands that populism is a very good way to reach some part of the electorate.  Lepper was authentic. 

**And which populist is the worst?** 

As a British, I have to say Nigel Farage.  He was able to create the impression that he is a folk tribune that expresses the views and values ​​of ordinary people.  In practice, it has nothing to do with this world. 

**Is PiS a populist party?** 

This is always a problematic issue for me.  I don't know if this should be said, although in the literature literature PiS is written in this way. 

In my opinion, PiS is a party that uses populist language strategically, and this is not always the case.  This was evident, for example, before the 2015 election, when PiS wanted to show that it was a moderate and responsible party. 

**So what party is PiS?** 

The most important features of this party are nativism and statism.   Populist language allows you to create a coherent electorate from many  social groups that do not necessarily have something in common.   Thanks to it, the problems and frustrations of various people can be  described as if they came from one source - the enemy is the same,  thanks to which PiS voters can feel part of one community. 

&gt; The most important features of PiS are nativism and statism.   Populist language allows you to create a coherent electorate from many  social groups that do not necessarily have something in common.   
  Ben Stanley 

**And what is the political goal of the leaders of this community?**  **Is it about value or power?** 

My observations show that Kaczyński is a politician who has one constant view: that he is right.  He understands that there are certain topics or views that must be referred to to gain support. 

**The same question arises in the context of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.**  **Paul  Lendvai shows in Orbán's political biography, which the Liberal Culture  just published, that the Hungarian prime minister began in the early  1990s as an irreligious liberal, and then made a strong turn to the  right.**  **Orbán has only recently defined his political goal in terms of defending tradition and building illiberal democracy.** 

Experts of Hungarian politics believe that this change is instrumental and is intended to maintain power.  Orbán became rich using power instruments. 

In the case of Kaczyński, the Hungarians ask the question what does he get from all this?  Orbán is all about access to the fruits of power, not just power itself.  It seems that Kaczyński is motivated only by politics.  It is more important for him to win and bring competition. 

**Or maybe their intentions are not important?**  **They may be cynics or maybe not, but they are gaining high support.**  **So the idea works.** 

 It is true - regardless of Kaczyński's intentions, the political  division existing since 2005 is a social fact that will have a big  impact on Polish politics for the next decades. 

**If illiberal politicians get such high support in Hungary and Poland, maybe they just answer some real needs of people?** 

Some say that this is how politics work in this part of Europe.   It cannot be excluded that the last 30 years in Hungary and Poland have  been a liberal interregnum between various forms of authoritarianism. 

**Is populism in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe just like everywhere or does it have any characteristics?** 

Populism is the same.  But the environment is different. 

 If you look at Great Britain, the liberal-democratic institutions are  much stronger there, and therefore they have much more opportunities to  oppose the new political situation.   The success of populism in Central and Eastern Europe has shown that  although there are similar institutions here as in Western Europe, they  are unable to defend themselves. 

&gt;  It cannot be excluded that the last 30 years in Hungary and Poland have  been a liberal interregnum between various forms of authoritarianism.   
  Ben Stanley 

**How to respond to populist policy?** 

First of all, they must be treated as a serious threat. 

There is a tendency to underestimate this threat and treat populists as a new political mainstream.   Some liberal commentators say: it's bad that populists are gaining  support, but there is something to be said about what they say.  Liberals are afraid to defend their case.  And in this way they give the field to populists. 

Instead, you have to give it to them and tell them openly that they are wrong.  Liberal democracy is good.   Pluralism is a value worth defending and we are all its beneficiaries -  regardless of whether the elites did any harm to populists. 

**To do this, you must have liberal views.**  **And our ""liberal opposition"" is a bit conservative.** 

I agree, but you don't have to be a liberal to defend the institution of liberal democracy.   Reasonable conservatives do not always criticize PiS as much as I would  like, but they do not accept the attack on the political system, even  if they agree with PiS on social policy or culture. 

**So, first of all, don't be intimidated.**  **Secondly?** 

 It is important to take seriously the fact that in a pluralistic  society some citizens will have views that are not in line with the  canon of liberal values.  Liberals sometimes tend to behave as if only they were right.   The pluralism on which liberal culture rests is then transformed into a  kind of monism that is characteristic of populist policy. 

This has bad consequences.   Not only in Poland, but in many modern democracies, liberals were  afraid to enter into a discussion with people who did not share their  views.   If people can say what they want and even publish it in their  newspaper, but they don't talk to each other - it's not pluralism yet. 

**E.g?** 

In Great Britain, such a topic was the approach of a part of society to the issue of migration.  It was not worth waiting for this topic to become popular as a result of populist actions.   It could have been said much earlier that we are positive about  immigration and are ready to defend it - and our society is doing better  with it. 

 Instead, the liberals have hinted that this is a topic that must not be  discussed - that if you have any doubts about it, then you are a racist  and xenophobe.   Liberals, conservatives and socialists should recognize that populism  is easier to succeed in a political environment where the practice of  pluralism does not exist.",,/r/europe/comments/e90t0v/kaczyński_has_just_one_view_hes_right/faft5p5/,bm52oc,1576031238

Nobel celebrations. Ethiopian PM did a good speech in Norway (where the peaceprize is given and celebrated). 

The Swedish prom went without any faux pas. 

There's been a huge debate, and it's still ongoing, in regards to the Nobel prize in literature. Nobel himself loved literature, something his father hated and thought unmanly, which is why he added it. It, being a subjective art, isn't really in good company among empiric sciences. It's usually hilarious to see the ""morning brunch"" where all the winners talk to eachother during a brunch and the writers are usually clueless or malplaced. The year that graphene won the writer was basically told to shut up by the Russian-born winner (who had made the graphene) when the writer was talking about things she/he had no clue about in Russia. But I digress; This years winner is a Austrian who's basically a edgy cunt and always have been. Only he's refusing to call a legally-defined genocide just that: A genocide. 

Sweden has had a long tradition of peace-keeping and a long service with UN-peacekeeping. As such a great many swedes served with the UN during the Balkan-wars and saw firsthand the things there. As such the Battalion-Doctor, the first female one at that, was with the people protesting the literature-winner today. She was literally in the areas of massacres and was one of the people who reported said things to the world. A lot of people were saved by these reports, as even those committing the slaughtering knew that if they get caught redhanded they're done for. The peacekeeping-corps got a collective Nobel peace-prize for their work in the Balkans. That doctor now went up on stage and renounced her part of that Nobel prize, and removed the medal that had been awarded to her. 

So **TLDR** the Royal Academy has been in a clusterfuck for the last two years with #metoo ofcourse finding out that old, rich and powerful men do horrid things so two of the members left due to relations with said people. With more leaving in protests, to the point the academy didn't have mandate to even pick new members. Which is why there was no such prize last year. Now the new members gave this award and at that a fucking abhorrent defense of their pick where they basically made it worse with their wording, having members boycott the prom.

No one is bombing ""The Kurds"". Kurds are not one united entity Turkey. And the group you refer to as ""The Kurds"" in Northern Syria is YPG. Which is known to have direct links to PKK, which is an internationally recognized terror organisation. Saying Turkey is bombing the Kurds because it bombed YPG is like saying USA is bombing Muslims because it bombed ISIS. 

The total Kurdish population in Syria is estimated to be around 2 million, only a little portion of these 2 million people live in the area of ""Operation Peace Spring"". So it is clearly not intended to be a genocide.

Let's get to the numbers. UN's confirmed civillian death toll showed that less than 100 civillians died in that offensive, but that report was a while ago so let's assume it is like 150 now, and the operation is already finished. During that operation hundreds of shells were fired, there were also hundreds of airstrikes. 150 civillians are the collateral damage and even though it is sad, that is an impressively low number, when you take into consideration that Dutch somehow managed to kill 70 civillians in one airstrike. That means Turkey is probably the most sensitive side regarding civillians. 

&gt;he is going to send one million Turks to replace them is a genocide and he described it on TV.

That means if the civilization stops to exist, surviving humans are doomed: without oil and coal they with high certainty will be not able to rise to the same heights. But the civilization is still there. We can build complex things. If we don't do some it's because we actually have a plenty of energy, so much free energy we can exhaust it carelessly on stupid things. The stick works better than the carrot, as soon as it will become clear that there is not enough oil anymore to run for another 10-20 years, billions of dollars (representing human attention, labor and products) will go into thermonuclear reactors, the Launch Loop building, word-wide power grid.

Borysławsko-Drohobyckie Zagłębie Naftowe - the largest region of oil and wax extraction in Galicia, and later the Second Republic of Poland.

History Edit
The history of the Basin begins in 1896, when Władysław Długosz learned about the deep oil deposits and began its exploitation on an industrial scale. Earlier (certainly as early as the first half of the 17th century), shallow oil deposits and earth wax were exploited here[1].

In 1817 Josef Hecker began to extract and distil crude oil from wells and supplied a distillate for lighting Drohobych Street, military barracks in Sambor and salinas in Truskawiec.

In terms of oil production, Zagłębie on the world market periodically won fourth place after the United States, Russia and Romania. However, within a short period of time, due to the discovery of efficient oil deposits in Venezuela, Iran and Iraq, and as a result of the monopoly policy, it fell to one of the last places as a producer.

The Borishian ozokerite deposits, discovered in 1854 by the Lviv entrepreneur Robert Doms, were among the largest in the world in terms of extraction and resources.

In the second half of the 19th century, the Borishian ozokerite was used to insulate the first transatlantic telegraphic cable connecting Europe and the USA. In 1861, oil fields (including Robert Doms) were exploited, and in 1909, 5% of world production was produced here.

In 1866, mechanical drilling of oil wells began.

On December 31, 1872, the railway connection between Boryslav and Lviv was commissioned.

In 1905-1907 new, highly efficient wells were discovered, and the lack of tanks and the limitation of oil acceptance by refineries caused a sharp drop in oil prices and a crash on the oil stock exchange. The crisis accelerated the process of monopolisation in the oil industry and the concentration of both refining and trading in crude oil and its derivatives. As a result, in 1911 production was reduced to 1.5 million tonnes, and in 1913 to 1.1 million tonnes, i.e. to the level of 1907, while prices were almost tripled at the same time.

In 1928, Drohobycz district accounted for about 84% of the then Polish oil production, in 1933 - 76%, in 1937 - 67%[2].

4521,"&gt; It would be nice, if instead of this, you would try to stick with on topic arguments. 

It is entirely on topic, asking what your position is about, I do recon I could have used a different tone though.

&gt; Yet, when my representatives who do it, EU leaders demanded to stop that. So considering the current status of conflict between EU and Hungarian government, this is a topic where EU violated an essential freedom.   
&gt;  
&gt; Too bad they have ignored this. And there is a further issue there. You claim there is valid contact. Maybe. But when our decisions are held against us it is only fear if we are heard. Not only our politicians who only execute our will, but us, who want them to act in one way or other.   
&gt;  
&gt;Yet plenty of people who have contacted EU level officials were ignored. And I have yet to hear about anyone who wasn't ignored. 

You can't make an argument such a this one without backing it up. Who did your candidate adress to? Not ""EU"" I suppose, but a specific institution and a specific part of said institution with a specific administrator talking back to him.

ALSO, you do have directly elected representation in EU institutions, and indirect representation too, so I don't really know what you mean here.

&gt; Without that the **EU political decisions violate human rights and replace justice with political agenda.** I am sure that isn't excuseable at any circumstances. 

This is just false, EU institutions uphold the highest HR standards around. They have, in fact, raised them exponentially in states such as yours and mine and are actively maintaining them.

 [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/chapter/human\_rights.html?root\_default=SUM\_1\_CODED%3D13&amp;locale=en](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/chapter/human_rights.html?root_default=SUM_1_CODED%3D13&amp;locale=en)  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So when China ignores rights for some groups, that is better for some others and huge population and ""china as a whole can profit"" means it is all right there too? Or you have double standards? 

That is not what I said, rearranging priorities is in no way, shape or form the same as ignoring the needs of others, much less taking away rights.

 

&gt;This is why I have pointed out the issue with cab over engine trucks. Because that is a pretty simple and clear case where this authocratic behavior didn't help people. It only hurts and kills people. There are plenty of such decisions. Yet you decide to ignore them and make a false statements combined with a personal attack.

Didn't make a single false statement, and if I did please do underline it and come up with a proper refutal. I didn't emit personal attacks either, even if I do reckon I did not use a friendly tone.

4525,"Differences in other areas don't make this similarity false. 

Single party systems we don't have, that is true. In communist regimes, the decision making was made in a single party, but they had ""platforms"" that were similar to parties in a multi-party system. 

It was a system to ensure ""whoever disagrees with them cannot vote"". The moment where you understand that Article 7 system is built on political decisions, and they don't want to hear from some people, just lock people out of voting because they have a different opinion you would see a striking similarity.

On the abuse of human rights topic: It is easy to prove that the EU does that too, but the democratic process should be there to fix those issues. Human rights violations can be the result of honest mistakes and basic human behavior. Holding that against the EU would be unfair. 

But we should also understand there is a turning point. When EU leaders and EPP leaders decide they don't want feedback, want to take away voting rights without listening to the other side (without due process, etc), it quickly gets worse.   


The key difference between the EU and the Soviet Union, that we can still believe that the EU tries to act in good faith and correcting most problems are possible. It is a system worth fixing. Soviet rule was different. For some time it was universally bad. The rule of Mr. Kádár of Hungary or Tito of Yugoslavia was far more mixed as some leaders tried to act more or less in good faith, but plenty of others in the leadership acted in bad faith.",,/r/europe/comments/e8ple7/concerning_the_eu/faehrvf/,Enerla,1576001071

There's a list of countries in Africa in which China invests. To prove your claim you need to compare gdp growth of african countries without chinese investments with growts of african countries without chinese investments.

Don't blame Europeans for that. They fought to become independent from Europeans and they won. All the results after decades of independence are absolutely on them.

It only shows which propaganda works better.

Im fine with being in the single market. being in the EU is another thing. 

But why wouldn't it be fine? Nobody will enter in the next few years anyway,so what should we do? wait for the EU to change its mind on expansion instead of seeking out other options?

&gt;More trade deals with more countries might sound better on paper but those deals combined aren't worth as much as a proper EU deal.

These deals are guaranteed, the EU isn't guaranteed even if we make the criteria. 

&gt;Not to mention that the EU does in fact offer more trade agreements. Not only the invaluable Single Market, which is much more than an FTA, but also FTAs with Canada, Japan, MERCOSUR, etc. etc. If I remember right the EU's has the most trade agreements. 

Maybe, but it didn't offer any.

I totally get the economic reasons. China is emitting because it is, like everybody else, on a crazy race to increase GDP. I get it. I also absolutely get that Western nations need to bear much of the responsibility for the shitty situation we're in.

None of this absolves China from the fact that they are a major polluter. That their economic model is extremely dirty and they have absolutely no intention of doing anything else than paying lip service to the environmental question. That China is in a bid to undercut Europe and America through slave labor, IP theft and non-existent environmental laws.

What I know is that when Erdogan appeared in front of the cameras at the airport during the coup you can see he is pale and looks very shocked and he wasn’t comfortable at all, while he was trying to look like he was not worried and still strong. It didn’t give me the vibe he knew it all along and was fine with it.

On top of that, coups are political things and I am also sure he knew it was going to happen but there is no proof whatsoever that it was planned and staged by him or his government. I’ve also been to a Gulenist school in Germany because my maths wasn’t really strong and I have seen and heard how they think and operate and I more then 100% expect those cultists to do such things.

The Supreme Court has _never_ specifically found that persons born here to _illegal aliens_ are citizens, just that the same responsibility to US Persons exists (in _dicta_ in the 1982 case, not a holding).

The author of the amendment:

&gt;During the original congressional debate over the amendment Senator Jacob M. Howard of Michigan—the author of the Citizenship Clause—described the clause as having the same content, despite different wording, as the earlier Civil Rights Act of 1866, namely, that it *excludes Native Americans who maintain their tribal ties and ""persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers"".*

Even if we (and we did) passed laws recognizing Native Amerindians as Americans, as US citizens, there's no real case for continuing to issue US birth certs to foreigner's children, when they aren't here on an immigration visa, except habit.

4706,"If Humanity will continue to multiply itself by 2 every 50 years, then it will run out, yes. The limit example is demonstrated by Stanislaw Lem in his thoughts on Dyson sphere. The quadrillions of square kilometers of ""land"", enough place and resources for quintillions of people, and more, and more, and more. The question is why.

No matter how much land there is, Humanity will grow exponentially and therefore faster, quickly limiting itself just because of lack of space and sense. But if it's inevitable and come soon, why to bother and not limit our population right now, when we're mere billions of people, not quadrillions of suffering beings denied even the right of one unique thought for all of their life?

Currently we work as an open system that takes resources from outside and turns it into trash that can't be used. But it's not entirely true. When we digest food, carbon from it doesn't vanish but just changes its chemical form, the same about all other elements we use, it's still there, we just don't use it much. No doubt we will learn to build closed systems in the future, the cities that can run endlessly while energy (the only thing we lose) is available, and luckily we have nearby a thermonuclear reactor that gives us free energy for next couple of billions of years.

4748,"I'm aware of sola fide. Sola fide is not in contrast with the teachings of Jesus. Rather, the teachings of Jesus are the first point of sola fide. Jesus taught that you must be good to get into heaven. Specifically, you must feed every hungry person, clothe every naked person, house every homeless person, etc. (Matthew 25:35-40)

Sola fide simply starts by pointing out the obvious: that nobody can claim to have done what Jesus says is necessary to get into heaven. Sola fide does not deny that somebody could get into heaven by doing everything that Jesus commands. Sola fide is simply realistic about the capacity of flawed people to do that.

This leads to the more fundamental point that nobody stands condemned for not believing in Jesus. Rather, people stand condemned because of their selfishness and hatred. However, it is by having faith in Jesus and what he achieved on the cross that we can have our sins atoned for by his sacrifice.

And this relates to the final point that actually... Christianity is not based upon the teachings of Jesus. Jesus was a Jewish preacher who spoke to the Jews. Jesus obeyed the Old Covenant and encouraged his fellow Jews to do the same. Jesus, by his death, established the New Covenant.

This New Covenant is not elucidated properly until Paul--a former persecutor of the Church--shows up and begins to teach Christian doctrine. By the way, Paul's epistles actually come before the gospels and the earliest account we have of the gospel is in Paul's letter to the Corinthians, which was written ~15 years after Jesus's death.

Point being that the genesis of Christianity wasn't really with the gospels describing the life of Jesus, but rather with the letters of Paul describing the New Covenant. And yes, one of the things that Paul is very clear about is that salvation is by faith alone as per Ephesians 2:8-9.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/e8nq8d/this_day_501_years_ago_martin_luther_burned_the/fadup0n/,FriendlyCommie,1575986793

4828,"Venezuela isn't a good example, because it has been a mess for all of its history. The decade before the 1999 bolivarian revolution was an economic mess, which in part caused people to vote for Chávez. His rule was from an economic standpoint okay until 2010 or so, with good economic growth until the 2008 economic crisis, then some growth again after that until his death in 2013. 

There are several obvious problems with his policies that any half-decent socialist eonomist could easily point out. Setting prices for products, for example, is a completely nonsensical policy that doesn't in any way account for changes in demand and supply, forces companies (worker-owned or not) to sell at prices that might not make sense, which forces black markets and corruption and so on. He also replaced the people in charge of the oil industry with unqualified corrupt stooges. Worst of all, he and later Maduro destroyed the democratic system which caused international sanctions on Venezuela. 

Instead of Venezuela, we could look at for example Bolivia. Personally, I find it very alarming that there is such a personality cult grown around Morales, and he was very wrong to try to keep running for additional terms, but regardless at least until the latest election Bolivia appears to have been a geniune democracy with socialist policies. And what did those socialist policies achieve? Constant high economic growth since 2006 when Morales was elected. 

Moraels' policies also could've been much better, but they seem to have regardless worked. Mind you, I don't think South America is a good place for any sort of experiments: Almost no country in South America has been free of dictatorships and constant coups and massive corruption - In part due to policy by USA to orchestrate coups against anyone implementing policies USA doesn't like.

What you don't seem to understand is that the number of Croats in partisan ranks was constantly growing throughout the war. So also *before* Italy capitulated. I wonder how those thousands of dead Croatian fighters got to Neretva and Sutjeska 🤔

Mentioning that Croat numbers in the partisan army swelled after Italy's capitulation like it's some damning revelation just shows your ignorance on the topic of partisan warfare in Yugoslavia. It's banal. Like mentioning how the number of Serbians in the partisans skyrocketed after the liberation of Belgrade. Of course it did. In both cases the partisans took control of large cities and large quantities of weapons - a logical consequence would be that their numbers would rise.

Until late 1943 the partisan army had big problems with equipment. That, together with very strict conspiratorial principles, meant that you couldn't just walk out from, say, Zagreb to some partisan-held village and join the army. It was a complicated procedure, and there's a ton of sources for that if you'd like.

4855,"&gt;Yeah, all the Nordic countries are so awful.

As someone living in Denmark I don't see how Luther is responsible for the welfare state at all.

&gt;Because of Lutheranism the literacy rates among Northern Europeans skyrocketed. How is that intellectual damage?

I don't think the reformation can have sole credit for literacy, as it rose outside of reformed countries as well. It was primarily the printing press that made literature more cheap to produce and thus more accessible. 

The very fact that people were able to read Luther's writings across countries was due to literacy already being on the rise due to the printing press. Otherwise you are claiming that the reformation made people more literate retroactively. 

&gt;What on earth are you trying to say? You think Lutheran priests weren't educated? 

Try to consider this, most education and universities in Europe were run by the Church, in fact they still are in Latin America. Once Catholicism was banned in certain protestant states it left many countries including Denmark empty of teachers. The same thing is true for hospitals. It took a while before the secular state could man those positions and in some instances had to invite the Catholics back into the country to provide their social services. In Denmark it wouldn't be until the 17th century that there was a public school system. 

Immediately after the reformation however the educational responsibility were given to the nobles who the king charged with educating their underlings, many nobles sidestepped that obligation, and those that did provide never put in any effort into it.  

&gt;No he didn't. In fact, his views on women were rather positive considering the era.

Isolating ourselves, creating division between euro countries is counter productive and short sighted. When other countries in much more ""safe"" geographical areas start to follow this strategy, shit will hit the fan at fantastic rates.

Let's face it, he needs this crisis, it's his entire platform.

And another reason I can't trust him is his incredible whoring out to southerners. He was saying incredible shit about them just a few years ago. Now it's ""Prima la Sicilia"".

5078,"Trump works as a ""fuck you"" because he's perceived as bad *for the establishment*. It's a form of /r/maliciouscompliance : we can't have who we want so here, have fun with this asshole.  That's essentially why the majority of people who vote for Trump will vote for him in 2020. They don't like him. They simply don't like the establishment more.

Those women are not a ""fuck you"" for the establishment. They are the ""oh fuck me"" *from* the establishment because they are Obama - a clown, a puppet and a complete narcissist who will sell you out while blaming you and calling you names for being unhappy about it.

That's the difference between Trump and Obama. Obama was elected by the establishment to silence criticism over the policies they wanted to make and use minority turnout to stay in power.  This is why turnout in 2008 and to lesser extent in 2012 was bigger. Trump was elected against the establishment and on a very low turnout, just barely above 50% and many of the people who voted for him were backing Sanders until he was Clintoned.

By backing those women here you are not electing directly some argumentative woman who is going to annoy the old boys' club who disregard the complaints of the people. You are electing a prostitute who is going to do the same stuff as before but this time she will scream at you if you criticize her and pull out all the imaginary victimhood she can come up with, as well as trying to appeal to dumber women by trying to divide them away from men.

This is also why whenever the left goes for the woman card the right tends to follow - to deny them the ""woman card"" argument, which is sad because it really shows how dumb women can be. Oh she's a woman, she cares about me.

No. She slept with the party secretary to get higher on the list or with some major donor to ensure patronage.  That's what she cares about.

&gt;So this govt in Finland too is a result, not the problem. 

No. It's still the problem because nothing changed. You are just dumber than you thought you were if you are telling yourself this bullshit to validate some idiotic bias that you hold on to.

&gt;So my point was you call ppl idiot for voting a ”pretty face” but not if they vote for the ugly fucker? I dont think either are idiots.

Do you really think you are making a point here?  Other than demonstrating that indeed you are dumber than you thought you were?
 
If you vote for some ""ugly fucker"" then you are not voting based on their looks.  Voting based on looks is dumber than voting based on false premises about their intentions.

And if by ""ugly fucker"" you meant Trump then you are even dumber than I just wrote.  I just said the exact opposite in the previous comment but you twisted my words.

5099,"The narrative of Danzig as a German city was fueled by the anti Polish sentiment and German nationalism of the 19th century and used as a Justification for the annexation of the city. Following WW1 when both Poland and Germany wanted the city the Nazis were more then happy to keep promoting this myth, and now in the 21st century with more neutral and unbias historians around, parroting this same myth, what else is it if not repeating Nazi propaganda?  

Why is it that out of the 1000+ years of the cities history and the 700+ years of which were spent as a part of Poland, you are so focused on the time following WW1? After a century of Germanisation policies aimed at forced assimilation, diminish the use the Polish language and destroying what ever sense of Polish identity the people had? They even tried to cover up its beautiful hansiatic architecture by promoting the ""national architectural style"" of neogothic to make it look like any other German city. 

Did you know that in 1813 Gdansk petitioned the Prussian government to allow the city to be returned to Poland? Why not stop at there, the city did not want to be separated from Poland. Full stop. Yet you choose the time period when Polish communities were being eroded as what defines the city as ""German""? You reek of bias and ignorance. 

I see you edited your comment, that is progress, but still wrong. 

As I already pointed out the city was not built by Germans, From 1563, for over a century, the post of town master builder was held by architects from the Netherlands.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Gda%C5%84sk#cite_note-21) Entire streets were designed in [Dutch Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_architecture#Netherlands/Flanders) style. After Germany conquered the city development stagnated and the cities no longer flourished, which is why they wanted to remain part of Poland. 

What do you even know of its cultural identity? Do you imagine a bunch of people dressed in Lederhosen eating sauerkraut running around the street with mugs of Beer? WTF do you mean by the German majority formed its cultural Identity? Its culture was its own. Would you believe American's are still British even after they broke off?

Did you even know that this city of the center of the Polish Lutheran movement? 

&gt;Beside a majority of German-speakers,[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk#cite_note-Zamoyski-46)  whose elites sometimes distinguished their German dialect as [Pomerelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomerelia),[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk#cite_note-47) the city was home to a large number of Polish-speaking Poles, [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) Poles, [Latvian speaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_language) [Kursenieki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursenieki), [Flemings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Netherlands) and [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people). In addition, a number of [Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_people) took refuge or migrated to and received citizenship in the city. During the [Protestant Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation), most German-speaking inhabitants adopted [Lutheranism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism). Due to the special status of the city and significance within the [Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth), the city inhabitants largely became bi-cultural sharing both Polish and German culture and were strongly attached to the traditions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk#cite_note-Chwalba-48) 

For comparison, in the 1530's  from Church records, 1/4  of Konigsberg were Lutheran Poles, not taking into account Catholic ones. Given that unlike Konigsberg Gdansk was actually part of Poland for much longer and that many would have been bilingual, how much of ""cultural identity"" do think Poles contributed to one of Poland's most important cities? I bet you don't even know what Sarmatism was. 

My point is the city was neither built by Germans or formed its ""cultural identity"" by Germans and if you are actually interested in having an ""civilized discussion""  you should do some actual scholarly research and not say things you aren't sure of on such sensitive topics, I would recommend the book ""The Other Prussia"" by Karin Friedrich if you are interested.",,/r/europe/comments/e7rrcv/gdansk_poland/fad80ap/,anon086421,1575958841

5168,"Yes? The term ""German"" usedto mean ""German speakers of the HRE"" as opposed to modern times where it's meaning morphed into ""Citizen of Germany"".  Which is why some people still get confused about Austria even today. Even the Dutch were once called German hence the similarity between Dutch and Deutsche. Which is funny considering how much a big impact the Dutch had on Gdansk's development and how Germans like to take claim them as their own. 

The Czechs were quite distinguished in the HRE since they were a Kingdom, and they spoke, Czech. And although  the Austrian Empire was a multi ethnic state and there were definitely  many Slovak's and Croats who were happy to call themselves Citizens of Austria the comparison is still very different because your talking about Austria conquering a another state whose speakers were unique to that state while German speakers were not exclusive to Germany. A better example would be like how America broke off from Britain and created its own separate culture and identity and it would be absurd to claim that even now Americans were still British  in 1970 for example.  Just like how Gdansk broke off from the Teutonic Order and formed its own Identity within Poland that was very much influenced by the culture of Poland, Sarmatism is just an example of it.  It would be idiotic to deny there would have a strong Polish identity in the city especially since it was part of Poland for so long and literally wanted to remain part of it.

5216,"A lot of older historical analysis of the Anglo-Saxon migration into Britain should be taken with a grain of salt. Victorian historians looked at it through a lens fundamentally saddled with early-modern notions of colonialism and conquest, so they assumed that the natural result of movement of one cultural group into a new region was inherently violent. Anglo-Saxon chroniclers were keen to present a version consistent with legendary warriors like Hengist and Horsa sweeping away the “worthless” Britons and seizing their lands, and these texts largely support such an approach.

The genetic and archaeological evidence suggest a more complex picture. We know that the Britons were not wiped out, but adopted Saxon customs almost entirely. There’s good reason to believe that the contact was between a number of fragmented Anglo-Saxon kin groups settling in Britain without coordination, and who had a variety of interactions with the local Britons - sometimes violent, sometimes commingling and trading. There’s not a *clear* inference to be made from the facts that the Saxons conquered the Britons, since greater success in farming might also explain why many Britons gradually chose to fold in with Anglo-Saxon groups and adopted their customs and language over the course of generations.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/e8f40g/the_approximate_spread_of_the_gaels_britons_and/fad2zk0/,Keyserchief,1575953741

&gt;32:37 Then starting in about 2009, things began to go south.
&gt;
&gt;32:41 And I think in 2016 with Brexit, a hammer blow was delivered to the EU.
&gt;
&gt; 32:48 And now if you just sort of look at what's going on in countries like Italy and countries
&gt;
&gt; 32:52 like Greece, and you look at the differences between France and Germany over how to run
&gt;
&gt; 32:57 Europe, it doesn't look like a happy future is in store.
&gt;
&gt; 33:01 It's so fascinating because this brings us back to what you said at the beginning, which
&gt;
&gt; 33:06 was really how we went from the 1990s to where we are today.
&gt;
&gt;33:10 And the 1990s was such an optimistic time, not just in the US but Maastricht was passed
&gt;
&gt;33:16 in the early 90s, Germany reunification happened.
&gt;
&gt;33:19 The Euro, monetary union, when they were...
&gt;
&gt;33:22 It's remarkable to go back, because I had studied this period in college, when the technocrats
&gt;
&gt; 33:27 in Europe would debate...
&gt;
&gt; 33:28 As you know, I'm sure, the technocrats in Europe were debating Maastricht and the Euro.
&gt;
&gt;33:33 They saw the problems that they could encounter, but they saw them as opportunities.
&gt;
&gt;33:38 They saw the discrepancy between fiscal monetary policy, the tensions it would create as crisis
&gt;
&gt;33:43 opportunities for further integration.
&gt;
&gt; 33:45 They saw it optimistically.
&gt;
&gt; 33:47 Now, these things are sources of instability on the continent.
&gt;
&gt; 33:50 Yes.
&gt;
&gt; 33:51 It's quite remarkable.
&gt;
&gt; 33:52 It is quite remarkable.
&gt;
&gt; 33:53 I think the article, one of the most important articles written in modern times, it was Francis
&gt;
&gt; 33:59 Fukuyama's piece that appeared in the national interest in 1989, entitled, The End of History.
&gt;
&gt; 34:08 And basically what Fukuyama argued in that piece was that the liberal democracies had
&gt;
&gt; 34:13 defeated fascism in the first half of the 20th century.
&gt;
&gt; 34:18 They had defeated communism in the second half of the 20th century.
&gt;
&gt; 34:22 And now the only viable political form of government that was left for every state on
&gt;
&gt; 34:28 the planet was liberal democracy.
&gt;
&gt; 34:31 So Fukuyama's basic argument was that over time we were going to have more and more liberal
&gt;
&gt; 34:38 democracies until we reached the point where the planet had nothing but liberal democracies
&gt;
&gt; 34:41 on it.
&gt;
&gt; 34:42 And in a world like that, we were going to live happily ever after.
&gt;
&gt; 34:46 And if you read the Fukuyama piece carefully, he says at the end that he believes the greatest
&gt;
&gt; 34:52 problem that we are likely to face in the future is boredom.
&gt;
&gt; 34:56 Boredom.
&gt;
&gt; 34:58 Because he thinks that liberal democracy is on the march and it's for everybody.
&gt;
&gt; 35:04 And of course it's not turned out to be the case at all.

5220,"It is a myth because the perception of Gdansk as German was motivated by German nationalism, hatred for Poles, and as a justification for the partitions of Poland, in the 19th century. Similarly how Austria invoked an old medieval treaty between Hungary and Poland as a justification of annexing Galicia, even though Hungary never tried to claim it them selves.  A similar thing existed with Copernicus, you did not find people arguing ""Copernicus was German"" , on the contrary you do have accounts of contemporary Germans, who lived during the same era, literally referring to him as Polish. But I did read, mid 20th century texts, by German ""scholars"" actually arguing he couldn't be Polish because Poles were too stupid.  They even ignored the fact that he spoke Polish and claimed ""every word he uttered was German"". Clearly you can see how nationalism twists history and that the motives here were anything but honesty. 

You can't from a more neutral 21st point of view seriously argue that people who lived in Poland for centuries, did not call them selves Germans, and actively tried to remain a part of Poland, were ""German"" biased solely on that they spoke German or a large part could trace its ancestry back to Germany. It would be like arguing that to this day, Americans are still British. Its just blatantly wrong.  Imagine in 2050 the UK conquers the USA 

And it  wasn't a majority German city by 1271. according to wiki, which isn't the best source either, but seems to be much better than that website. 

&gt;Around 1235 the settlement had some 2,000 inhabitants and was granted [Lübeck city rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BCbeck_city_rights) by Swantopolk II. Merchants from the [Hanseatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League) cities of [Lübeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BCbeck) and [Bremen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremen_(city)) began to settle in the town after 1257, although a significant German population was not present until the 14th 

Massive German immigration happened during the mid 13th century after the Mongols and civil war depopulated the country and Poland needed people, which is when it started to become a country of immigrants and its trough this lens you should view Poland, ironically like the USA today, where you have immigrants forming their own communities where they maintain there old language as well as learn the new language of the country they settled in. Although in this case this was before a national standard education system, German remained the dominant language and Polish became a secondary one. Which is why most people still had German(Dutch names were the same as German names), that was the language they spoke. Notable people who were relevant outside the German Speaking areas had a Polonised version of the name just like Poles in Prussia had Germanized names. Does Johannes Hevelius sound Polish to you? How about ""Jan Heweliusz"" ?

&gt;Hevelius considered himself as being citizen of the Polish world (*civis Orbis Poloniae*)[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Hevelius#cite_note-29) and stated in a letter dated from 9 January 1681 that he was *Civis orbis Poloni, qui in honorem patriae suae rei Literariae bono tot labores molestiasque, absit gloria, cum maximo facultatum suarum dispendio perduravit*\-""citizen of Polish world who, for glory of his country and for the good of science, worked so much, and while not boasting much, executed his work with most effort per his abilities 

He was the mayor of Danzig btw. 

The city was literally built by Dutch architects, and yet you believe it was ""history was shaped mainly by German settlers""

&gt;from 1563, for over a century, the post of town master builder was held by architects from the Netherlands.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Gda%C5%84sk#cite_note-21) Entire streets were designed in [Dutch Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_architecture#Netherlands/Flanders) style.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Gda%C5%84sk#cite_note-22) 

See the problem of believing myths? 

The city was shaped by Poland. It gave it many freedoms and treated it as its main port, it was only allowed to grow and flourish as it did thanks to Poland,  the TO attacked the city because it was competing with the orders city Elblag and tried to put restrictions on its trade. That is why the city originally asked Poland the retake it. And the same thing happened after Prussia annexed it, it suffered economically, did not develop and industrialize like other cities in Germany, **that the city even petitioned Brandenburg Prussia to return the city to Poland.**",,/r/europe/comments/e7rrcv/gdansk_poland/fad35um/,anon086421,1575953895

*What*

&gt;They committed genocide again during WW2 and were allied with the Nazis.

Fun fact, there was a shitload of Croats in the partisan resistance. People just tend to forget that bit around here.

&gt;Their national holiday is based on ""liberating"" Croatia in the 90's by forcing out all of the Serbian civies living on its territory (over 250K), the literal definition of ethnic cleansing.

I have my qualms about our political leadership's role in the 90s war and operation Storm itself (I do think the Croatian state tried to make everything very difficult for any Serbs that wished to return) but what is celebrated is liberation of occupied territory. The war didn't start in 1995 you know? 

This is the sort of selective historical blindness that Balkan people are unfortunately well known for. For a Croat nationalist, nothing problematic happened in 1995.

5280,"I think the American problem is twofold. One is shared with the British: constitution and convention that have become simply too old or too unwieldy for effective politics, thereby clogging the system. Once you're several layers deep into wilful misinterpretation, something somewhere is going to give. In the US, the Constitution and all the different meanings ascribed to it mirror debates within Christian canon law (and don't get me started on the Second Amendment -- everybody forgets the Eighteenth was repealed easily). In Britain, twenty years of total administrative overhaul from Good Friday and devolution in the '90s to the failed referendum to change voting laws in 2011. And what have they got to show for it? A state that barely even functions (or doesn't, in the case of N-Ireland), breaking down over the simplest international negotiations. All the pageantry in Westminster can't get themselves out of this one -- the Rebate this is decidedly not.

The other problem is presidentialism and what it does to a political culture (see also: France). Why does the head of state need to waste his time scoring legislative goals? Presidents (especially in less-than-democratic countries) are usually strongmen, whose main job is to tame the political beast by having the media focus on themselves. This takes agency away from the Lower House, the logical democratic center of a government, leading to more corruption and inefficiency. (That's why I said: look at McConnell and Pelosi.) Public opinion is telling: Americans sometimes have a good opinion of their president (that's media coverage), but Congressmen are invariably portrayed as corrupt and obstructive.

""Leprechaun Economics"" has become a loaded term pushed by certain hostile sources, exaggerating it far beyond Paul Krugman's throwaway remark. The original Krugman article was based on speculation regarding the anomalous 26% 2015 growth rate - once broken down his assumption that it was down to tech re-domiciling proved false - it was a single, huge aircraft leasing company which accounted for 17 percentage points out of 26% growth that year, and the remainder is attributable mostly to domestic GNP recovery post-recession.

5301,"&gt;*Polish-speaking Lithuanians* ***often*** *found it outrageous to be called 'Poles*

Lol ok. Sounds more like the person who wrote the quote is the one outraged by the label Poles due to some nationalist driven hatred of polonisation then the actual nobles who literally 

&gt; began to call themselves *gente Ruthenus, natione Lithuanus*.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_nobility#cite_note-2) A good example is the [Chodkiewicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chodkiewicz) family, which attributed its ancestry to the [House of Gediminas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Gediminas). 

Or, 

&gt;Over the course of time, the Lithuanian nobility  increasingly developed a sense of belonging to the Polish nation.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_nobility#cite_note-Kotljarchuk-15) During the 19th century, a self designation, **often** represented using a Latin formula *gente Lithuanus, natione Polonus* (*Lithuanian by birth, Polish by nationality*) was common in the [Lithuania Proper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania_Proper) and former [Samogitian Eldership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samogitian_Eldership)

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm not going to claim language determines nationality but not only did they willingly adopt Polish,  they adopted Polish coats of arm and actually married Polish nobles, meaning they could trace some ancestry back to old Polish houses. So yes, they were Polish to some extent no matter how much it hurts some nationalists to admit, which is why Historians call them Polish-Lithuanian nobles. If anything Lithuanians should be grateful for being able to claim some of them  even as half Lithuanian and half Polish and not just Ruthenian considering how much of them were from Ukraine or Belarus. Even Jogaila was half Russian :)

Do you really think Pilsudski, the dictator of Poland, would be outraged at being called Polish? LOL you already proved you are a bias Lithuanian nationalist who called the Polish Identity ""shitty""

&gt;We're trying to save them from their shitty Polish identity

This is not correct. The colour system groups countries based on their language family or branch of the Indo-European language family. 

Indo-European is the predecessor of nearly all European languages (all Romance languages like French, Spanish, Italian; all Germanic languages like English, German or Swedish; all Slavic languages like Polish, Czech or Russian; and also all Celtic languages like Irish or Gaelic) If you were to colour all countries that have Indo-European roots in the same colour, nearly the whole map would be the same colour and be essentially meaningless. 

That is why the different branches of Indo-European get different colours: Romance languages get orangy-red, Germanic languages get green and Slavic languages get blue.

Celtic languages are not Romance languages. Celtic languages are not Germanic. Celtic languages are not Slavic.

&gt; But you can be against that while still being pro-military.

You're the one that incorrectly identified my stance as being anti-military, by reading your own version of my thoughts into my position.

Not spending money on keeping the Jews of Israel safe while they brutalize their dumber cousins, or one group of Asians safe from another fundamentally identical group of Asians, at American expense, doesn't imply not spending that money at all on keeping *Americans* safe.

&gt; Usually (far) righters are either for ethnical unity, religions unity or economic freedom.

Economic freedom like prostitution and porn being legal? Like bulldozing beautiful American landscape for Godless degenerate cities to expand ""affordable housing"" for some third world imported labor? Economic freedom like foreign goods which displace American labor experiencing no tariff?

5371,"No. 

Different countries have very different economic structures and cultural expectations of government spending. One-size-fits all is a horrible solution and will suit nobody. Taxation as a sovereign right of each member state is enshrined in the EU by design. If you force taxation on a bloc-wide basis, you remove a key tool in fiscal management. What do you do if one country is running a large deficit and others are running a large surplus? You've taken away their ability to determine an appropriate rate of business tax, the books would have to be rebalanced with much more disruptive adjustments to income tax. The EU already has rules restricting member states to keep deficits reined in, and that's as far as it needs to go.

It absolutely has to be made clear also **not one single large business has relocated from Europe to Ireland for tax reasons**. The multinationals in Ireland are overwhelmingly American. They could accuse of tax piracy if they want, but Europe can't. Tax competitiveness is a perfectly valid basis for attracting foreign investment, and forcing a unified tax rate basically forces governments to collect revenue it doesn't need or want. Say Ireland did raise it's tax rates, the primary impact would be the collapse of domestic indigenous exporters, who would fail because operating costs in Ireland are 20-40% higher due to geography and economy of scale. Maybe US multinationals would pack up, take their 10% of the workforce and high wages with them, and take all that revenue back to the US. Instead of being booked on Irish GDP, and contributing to EU funds, Ireland ends up with a massive government deficit *less* tax collected, and less employment. Great. But France doesn't have to worry about making it's economy more competitive.

What nations need to do is what the OECD says they should do - actually start taxing revenues in the state, rather than allowing them to be extracted elsewhere tax-free (this is the change Ireland made after wholesale conduiting to zero tax British overseas territories). If you're unhappy with the single market operating the way it was designed to, with capital and people moving freely, then they should utilize the national-level tools they already have at their disposal and legislate to tap it. There's absolutely no reason to do this at a bloc-level unless the goal was to cripple any upstart threat to the status quo ""core"" economies.",Connacht,/r/europe/comments/e8cpn7/gdp_per_capita_ppp_2018_world_bank/fac9s4p/,Shy-Talk,1575935776

Funnily enough, *herceg* was used as a noble title for a while, and it gave the name to Herzegovina. Its Slavic calque, *vojvoda*, is also used for dukes in the western feudal context, or as a slightly poetic word for a medieval army commander.

How fortunate for the EU that Ireland lobbied to get these industries in at a very early stage of their development, so that we could become net contributors, rather than them remaining in the US, leeching all their sales from Europe back to Uncle Sam's purse, while Ireland remained a drain on EU funds.

5424,"&gt;Handke has often spoken out in defense of Milošević, including stringent denials of concentration camps and war crimes in Bosnia, including Srebrenica. 

So ? So have some of the US generals. So have some of UN people from at the time. So have some scholars.

Should you boycott these people as well and take away their rewards ?

&gt;Phillip Corwin, former UN Civilian Affairs Coordinator in Bosnia, advisor and contributor to the work of the Srebrenica Research Group[355] said ""What happened in Srebrenica was not a single large massacre of Muslims by Serbs, but rather a series of very bloody attacks and counterattacks over a three-year period.""[356]

Exiled from the UN ? Put on trial ? Fired ?  What do we do ?


&gt;Lewis MacKenzie, former commander of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia, was continuing to challenge the description of genocide in 2009 on the grounds firstly that the number of men and boys killed had been exaggerated by a factor of 4 and secondly that transfer of the women and children by bus contradicted the notion of genocide – the women would have been killed first if there had been an intent to destroy the group. 

Let's take all the medals form UNPROFOR commander ? 

&gt;Portuguese retired general Carlos Martins Branco published ""Was Srebrenica a Hoax? Eyewitness Account of a Former UN Military Observer in Bosnia"" in 1998, and his memoirs ""A Guerra nos Balcãs, jihadismo, geopolítica e desinformação"" (War in the Balkans, Jihadism, Geopolitics, and Disinformation) in November 2016. He said ""Srebrenica was portrayed – and continues to be – as a premeditated massacre of innocent Muslim civilians. As a genocide! But was it really so? A more careful and informed assessment of those events leads me to doubt it""

Let's take his medals too.

&gt;The Srebrenica Research Group, a group led by Edward S. Herman and including two former UN officials,[360] claimed in their conclusions published in Srebrenica And the Politics of War Crimes (2005), ""The contention that as many as 8,000 Muslims were killed has no basis in available evidence and is essentially a political construct"".[361]

These two UN officials should be fired I guess ? 

&gt;Ibran Mustafić, a Bosnian politician in the Party of Democratic Action party (SDA), claims that more than 500–1000 Bosniaks in Srebrenica were killed by Bosnian soldiers, and that the Srebrenica massacre was an ""agreed genocide"" between Alija Izetbegović and international powers.

This one is just amusing, cause he was on the other side. Does he now lose his position in SDA ruling party of Bosnian Muslims ?

Trump is a product of a completely different political system and the dynamic there is upside-down from Europe.  There you vote against things, not for things.

Trump's actual base is small and they are just as retarded as the woke crowd or the never-trumper crowd. So yeah - his backers are fucking retarded. But that's not how American politics works.  

You could argue that not even people who supported him in the primaries are his base. He was elected because of the pathology of American political system and because of Clinton.  

Honestly?  I hoped Trump would win just to spite the dems.

There was a map doing round on reddit a day or two ago which showed that if ""nobody"" was an option then in 2016 it would be one of the greatest landslides in history.

If you look to the presidential election statistics you will see that people who backed both Clinton and Trump in the primaries constitute below 10% of electorate. Actually IIRC they are closer to 7-8%.

This is how absolutely pathological American ""democracy"" is.

So people don't vote for things they support because they can't.  They vote against people they oppose.  And this is why people back Trump.

5488,"Still the best election in the history for PD, 14 milions of votes. They managed to mobilize pretty much all their electoral base. And well, the party was divided even more than today. That was a good start but they were fool and they didn't understand that.

Anyway, we are talking about a different thing here: Salvini use the ''famous'' Morisi TRT - Television, Rete (web) and Territory - and you can't fight him on TV ignoring him, because people want to see him, he is divisive and for television channels he is perfect (Berlusconi had the little advantage to own three of six/seven major TV so he was in another league...but his televisions are very kind even with Salvini if I may). 

On territory Salvini's strategy is simple but effective, and you can't do nothing because meetings and ''selfie hours'' (it's mad the amount of selfies he makes) are for people who are certain to vote for someone. Contest him has no effect on this side of Salvini's strategy, it could be good a paralel meeting to reinforce the opposition - and that's why he fear Sardine, because these events could bolster a wide an divided front - but you don't move a single vote: these are electors who are certain to vote for one side. There aren't unsure voters to conquer, only your electoral base. Than if you make a big effort you can demotivate electors of other parties that can decide to not vote because they think they have not chances, but it's risky, you could have the opposite effect (the ''fear of fascism'' someone try to evoke every election)

On web you can do what Veltroni could't do; to go viral everything is good, if you ignore him you are boycotting him, so he is less visible for how social media works. It's a side, the only side of Salvini's strategy, where you can make a difference. Visibility is everything on web. The only effect you make criticizing him and using his hashtags is to make him viral.","Lucca, Italy",/r/europe/comments/e897ub/italian_farright_leader_salvini_swears_off_eating/fabtz1z/,LanciaStratos93,1575928789
5489,"Expelled ? No.  That's misleading, and even straight up lying.

It's a number of civilians (albanian civilians) displaced from Kosovo because of an ongoing conflict. Civilians can become displaced for any number of reasons, even if nothing happens to them, they just need to feel unsafe and leave. 

Expelled implies they were forced out (with force), which is not true for the vast majority of 862, 979 people. 

For example every other ethnicity also left in droves too during conflict, Serbs, Roma, Gorani also left in 230 000 (which was the vast majority of non-albanian population). They were displaced also, not expelled.

in this situation, greece did not do anything, turkey tried to have an agreement which is quite aggressive to put it politely. if you are talking about negotiations and how important they are, perhaps you should direct your thoughts elsewhere.

it was quite a dumm decision from tyrkeys part, not only the agreement cant pass from libyan parliament, the particular goverment may not be the goverment soon, the opposite political parties that control the parliament already published to un that they consider the agreement illegal, and above all, such a violent diplomatically agreement turned everybody against turkey. until now, many people in the west were not supporting greece because they believed turkey has valid points, now they dont.",,/r/europe/comments/e89s0q/greece_wants_eu_fullcourt_press_on_turkey_eu/fabu7gx/,cupid91,1575928896

The U.S. system is set up to be anti-urban. Rural votes count for twice what urban ones do in many ways because it was set up based on land, not based on humans. In my home state last month, there was a statewide vote on matters that only affected the city of Seattle for example. Sections of the state of washington can vote to raise their car tab tax to pay for nice things, so the ""urban"" parts of King, Snohomish, and Pierce counties voted for extra taxes to pay for public transportation, and the city of seattle separately voted for an increase of the car tab tax to pay for more busses in the city limits.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-trump-won-in-two-dimensions-1502320256

Socially conservative, fiscally 'liberal' (rather, in relative 'excess' exertion by the State, not that the contours of life should be shaped by laissez faire economics) characterizes far, far more of the American public that does the reverse, and probably more than socially liberal, fiscally liberal.

&gt;likes to have borders

Yes - America is for Americans, not wayward Guatemalans. I could hardly expect to just go to Japan and demand they provide for my basic needs like they do a citizen of Japan - and they'd have every right to refuse that and boot me out. Japan is theirs, and I am not Japanese.

Probably to return to this state of affairs where the demos is actually taken care of, we will have to restrict demotism in choosing our government. 

No one is too heartbroken , for instance, that we don't have direct democracy with *every* American, *all* of the American public,  for interest rate decisions from the Fed.

I had lessons for 9 years. I absolutely suck at it and at the same time I've enjoyed it very much, because my dream was to learn to play the violin. Being good at it would have been a bonus. Meanwhile my teacher had another adult student who started at an older age than me and he managed to do pretty well.
