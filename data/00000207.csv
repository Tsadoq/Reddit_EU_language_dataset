The medical condition is known as Gender Disporia, and is a very real condition like schitzophrenia. Many undergo sex changes and are still unhappy and want to revert after taking unhealthy drugs.

The main argument judgment is that while it is fair to question child marriage, which also happened during Europe and Roman times. The context in which she made it, her intent, etc was not to criticise and question, but to ""arouse justified indignation in Muslims"". 

Remember, our ""freedom of speech"" is not the same as the US understanding of ""freedom of speech"" due to europe's history. Just try the following examples


- Hold a swastika banner saying ""Hitler was right"" in front of Auschwitz Birkenau

- Walk through the centre of Riga waving a USSR flag.. 

- Goose step and Nazi salute in front of the Kremlin.
 
All actions will get you arrested, and rightfully so...    

I think the best analogy would be if I gave a speech in a ""Death to America"" conference that stated that the US founding founders, most of them were slave owners and there are documented cases of slave women give birth to their master's children. I would then compare these people to today's standard, to consider them as racist, rapist, slavers, least not mention how old the slaves were when they slept with their masters (below 18).

Marxism, just like Christianity have a problem with evolution. For Marxists, evolution stops for humans, 50000 years ago and there is no difference between anyone above the neck.

In reality, evolution didn't stop, it accelerated massively since agriculture massively changed the environment leading to new evolutionary pressures. A century is enough for large differences. A good chunk of evolution is the change of ""market shares"" of alleles, this happens in a handful of generation. New mutations take a few centuries to propagate, but it's still quite rapid.

And by the way, even in the NYT there was article about recent genomics data for predicting intelligence. 10% of high school grade variance. Top 20% scorers have 65% chance of getting a college degree. Bottom 20% have 15% chance. Just from DNA.

The hundred of mutations linked to intelligence race specific (British racial sample) and don't exist in Asian, Pacific Islanders and Africans.

155,"Thanks! It seems ""violent crime"" includes property damage there, hence the huge difference. Personally, I'm not too concerned about that, what I worry about is assault and murder, but ... YMMV.

&gt; They focus on the far-right... or rather whoever they deem to be far-right and nowadays that can be anyone. When I think of demonstrates being attacked around the world, examples of the left doing the attacking comes to mind, they are the ones that want to stop marches, conferences, etc. I really think you are giving the far right too much credit here (organized, some deeper ideology, etc.).

It's more of a case of not giving the ""left"" much credit. Looking at the G20 summit as an example for what you are pointing out, I don't see the hand of an organized left, but rather the chaotic [black bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bloc) who don't seem to have much of a plan other than to express their disaffection with the status quo and cause trouble. Notably, they arrive to such meetings from all over the globe, greatly inflating any statistical influence of crime statistics tracking over the ""days of chaos"" surrounding these anarchist riots.

The last serious left-wing terror group in Germany was the RAF, and that was decades ago. It's a statistical fact that right-wing extremists are more active when it comes to high-profile crime. They get more people into the hospital, they cause more murders. And again: they regularly explicitly target ordinary folks, deemed opponents for not conforming to their twisted worldview.

If you feel that the left is more prone to attacking peaceful demonstrators than the right, I can only point to what we've seen in the news. Who was driving their car into a group of protestors? Which groups were drawing firearms in front of protesting opponents? Not the left, who aren't even sporting the same level of organisation.

And to stress this again: that is not to excuse those nutjobs on the other end of the spectrum who likewise feel compelled to reach for violence in this ever-escalating public division. I'm just pointing out which side seems more prone to do it more often, with more preparation, and greater consequences.

&gt; If their mission is to fight against racism, they will find racism everywhere, if they are against Right Violence, they will want/present the number of these incidents as high as possible (bigger problems = more funding, support, people, power, etc.).

Perhaps, yet they are also tracking those cases which government agencies are dismissing for no discernable reason whatsoever. We have evidence of high-level officials of both the German police and the interior intelligence sugarcoating the statistics. Just last month, chairman of the interior intelligence [Hans-Georg Maaßen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Georg_Maa%C3%9Fen#Chemnitz) was removed from his post as he flat-out denied a mob of right-wingers was hunting immigrants, in spite of video evidence being readily available. Just another ""coincidence""?

&gt; Hahaha, sorry but that is ridiculous, pluralism in Poland actually never has been better. I can go into detail if you want of how stupid that link is.

No, thanks. I've read extensively on the subject when I was a neutral observer from the outside, and I think we're simply not on the same level on this subject and others. As mentioned earlier: perception. Neither of us will be able to convince the other.

&gt; Could you give some examples because as far as AFD goes, I can only recall a couple news articles from reddit where their marches were stopped/cancelled due to counter protesters, not the other way around.

[The riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Chemnitz_protests#Protests) connected to the aforementioned Maaßen affair are the most recent example that springs to mind, though my comment was not limited to the AfD but the far-right in general. The AfD at least struggles to maintain a civic image so to better point fingers and claim a moral high ground -- that is when there *aren't* any [leaks of internal chats and emails](https://www.morgenpost.de/politik/article210976999/WhatsApp-Nachrichten-setzen-AfD-Landesverband-unter-Druck.html) where they joke about putting people in camps or suggest cleansing the press after, to quote, seizing power.

""Not very good to see this published in an election year"", as AfD parlamentarian Mrosek comments.

Amazing it's come to this.

&gt; Do you really think thats what he believes?

No, but a number of his fans do. That's how normalization works: person A makes an offensive joke, and persons B and C agree, taking it serious. Because ""finally someone says it"". It's considered ""edgy"" and suddenly all the cool guys are doing it. See 4chan and its penchant for using homophobic slurs in everyday lingo, even outside its /pol board.

You know how peoples' personality is shaped, yes? We grow up and end up a product of our surroundings; our parents, our neighbors, TV, the internet. The influence of social media has increased considerably, to an extent where I actually consider the misinformation propagated on those channels as a threat to democracy. Already, elections were stolen on the basis of lies and populism. This is going to become an even bigger issue in the near future, and occasionally I do sit back and wonder how to best approach this challenge before society has radicalized to a degree where we revert to authoritarianism.

&gt; Thats your opinion, humor is subjective, you dont have to find it funny for it to be a joke.

By that logic, *everything* can be sugarcoated and dismissed as a joke. That doesn't make everything okay.

This is a fundamental difference between our positions, though, and as such yet another point where we'll just have to agree to disagree.

&gt; I disagree, is this(""are we the baddies"" sketch) normalizing nazizm?

No, but that's why context matters, and why we have courts to rule over individual cases of breach of the law.

And this is also not about *changing* peoples' mind, it is about influencing those who do not have a strong opinion to begin with. This is how propaganda works.

&gt; Thats what you strongly implied, you basically summed up the left as kicking trash cans and burning cars, ""whilst"" the right-wingers consolidate political support, murder or maim their opponents and radicalize the political debate. Thats an extremely dishonest presentation of the situation.

Perception once more. I'm looking at the statistics and see the left mostly engaging in property damage. I look at the news and see right-wing extremists hunting immigrants, attacking politicians and journalists, and (as linked earlier) getting away scot-free for assaulting citizens, whilst parts of the police and interior intelligence are caught collaborating with right-wing parties and downplaying the security risk, whilst they focus on watching the left.

From a political point of view, I know which side I consider more dangerous. Poke me again once you find those elusive left-wing terror groups that go around assaulting ordinary people, propagating hate and segregation. To me, most of the alleged left-wing punks are just aimless youths trying to find an outlet for their rage. It's actually the same with most right-wing thugs -- except that the latter unload their rage in a more targeted manner.

&gt; I guess we will have to agree to disagree, only time will tell which one of us was right.

One is general criticism of a religion, the other is very personal and directed towards real people. Normalizing hate speech towards specific groups, and dehumanizing others, is a slippery slope that leads to racism, racist attacks, violence against minorities, and a general worsening of society.

However such people completely neglect other well sourced Hadiths that claim she was 19 or 21 depending on the narrative you choose to believe in.

272,"&gt;My understanding is that it'd be able to carry lots of ordonnance but would have to give up on stealth mode to do so. And that without stealth, it was a good plane but not that good and a F-22 (maybe even a F-15?) or a Rafale could very well win a match. Am I wrong?

That is correct. For full stealth each of the F-35's two weapons bays can only carry 2 AIM-120s (soon to be 3) or an AIM-120 and either a single weapon of up to 2000lbs (1000lbs in F-35B due to bay size constraints) or a set of 4 SDB (small diameter bomb). 

Without stealth each wing has a 5000lb hardpoint, a 2500lb hardpoint, and a hardpoint for a AIM-9x (though the current F-35C outer wing doesn't have enough safety margin with an AIM-9x for some maneuvers so its not currently certified for use but that's just the carrier version). They can also carry a greater number of smaller munitions by using multi-ejector racks on each external hardpoint (ie. 5000lb hardpoint carries rack with two 2000lbs bombs). The B and C can also carry a stealthy center-line gunpod and that hardpoint on may be used for future systems on all versions.

As to external what do you mean? If it were doing an A2A mission the F-35 probably wouldn't be carrying external munitions except maybe if it were operating as a missile truck with other F-35s with internal loadouts. If it were doing ground support it would probably ditch its remaining external load to become stealthy again and just bug out while maybe using one of the AIM-120s it carries to take a pot shot while the enemy is still at range (or take the pot shot to force them away temporarily and run towards friend fighters or SAMs if the enemy doesn't have the fuel fraction to use afterburners to catch up before it does/it has the fuel fraction to use its afterburners to run). 

If you're talking sensors (assuming everything is upgraded) they all have AESA radars with the F-22's AN/APG-77v(1) being the most powerful and having the highest module count and and the v(1) version includes most of the better tech of the F-35's radar (mainly for anti-ground modes). The F-35's AN/APG-81 almost certainly has the best technology out of all of these radars but has fewer T/R modules (and correspondingly lower power) than the F-22 but that's still more than the Rafale's RBE2-AA. The new radars of the F-15C and F-15E are the AN/APG-63(V)3 and the AN/APG-82(V)1 but there is less info about them, I'd guess they're similar in level to the RBE2-AA. 

Kinematically the F-22 is ... just unfair. It destroys everything else in turning and thrust. The only other plane that's comparable is the Su-57 if they can ever get the engines meant for it working and not just using older ones. The Rafale almost certainly has the best low speed turning performance of the other planes though might struggle in sustained. The F-35 has similar sustained turn rate to the F-15C but can reach a higher angle of attack so it can pull its max 9gs at lower speeds than the F-15C can so its probably a bit better there.  The F-15E is the only one of these (if were counting only the land based versions of the F-35 and Rafale) that doesn't have 9g turning ability so it loses. 

In gaining back/maintaining speed while turning the F-22 still beats everything else as with no fuel and no weapons its thrust to weight ratio is over 1.62 (exact thrust figures are classified) and it's also the only one of these aircraft with true supercruise (though the F-35 can kinda) and its 5th gen internal carriage is very low drag. The F-15C is next with nearly 1.7 but again the F-22 engine's thrust is not publicly known (if it go the more advanced version of its engine the F-35 has it would exceed 2). The Rafale has a TWR of 1.56 and might have better transonic drag character than the F-15C though probably not enough to beat it's sustained turning there. The F-15E is 1.5. The F-35A is 1.48. Of these the F-15s are the fastest exceeding mach 2.5. The F-22 is limited by skin heating to somewhere a bit over mach 2 (btw with the F-35's engine it could probably reach that speed without afterburners). The Rafale gets to 1.8 and the F-35A reaches 1.6. Though these speeds are almost never reached, for instance the fastest a coalition aircraft flew in Iraq was mach 1.05. That's why the F-35's DSI which prevent it from manipulating how it intakes air (limiting it's max speed) but are lower weight, drag, and RCS than normal intakes aren't that harmful and why its performance in the regions where combat is done is better than its TWR implies especially because of lower drag internal carriage since with external weapons max speed decreases a lot and which is what allow it ability approaching supercruise.

306,"Don't get me wrong, I totally know where you are coming from. It's just that, for me, a clear-cut criterion for what qualifies as hate-speech is needed. 

Otherwise, you risk being inconsistent in the application of the law, and it is also not fair to be put on trial for something that you did not know was illegal because the law is unclear in that respect. 

You could set your criterion for hate speech as ""anything that might be damaging to the lives of other individuals [or just protected groups if you prefer]"", but then you enter into other problems, because we won't agree on what instances are ""damaging"" on all cases. If we were to choose a fixed set of things that are considered ""damaging"", then we would soon find loopholes, cracks, things we missed, etc. People could argue, for example, that any proposal to secularize X or Y is an attack against their faith, and therefore hate speech because it would make their lives worse if they could not do X or Y. In Spain we have had plenty of case where Catholic associations have sued for blasphemy-type charges against different people, and they have won their cases.

Then there is also the question of whether someone deserves jail or a fine for thinking/saying something that could damage others if implemented. If a person simply thinks gay marriage should be illegal, and has no violent feelings towards gay people, well, I obviously disagree with him, but I would not curtail their free speech over that. 

And why should protected groups be the only ones protected under hate speech laws? Hate speech directed towards protected groups being punished harsher, sure. But why should a black citizen be protected more than a white citizen with respect to these hate speech laws? Doesn't this break the equality of rights before the law of citizens? In Spain, for example, we have a Gender Violence Act that only considers gender/domestic violence cases where a man attacks a woman, meaning that if my girlfriend attacked me, or your husband attacked you, we would receive less protection under the law that if I attacked my girlfriend. Is that fair?

So suppose you extend hate speech laws to encompass everyone. Well, it turns out many things would be damaging to the common person. Want to close that polluting factory? Sorry, one thousand workers would lose their jobs, you are committing hate speech. Want to lower taxes? Sorry, that would mean decreasing welfare spending, hate speech! Want to raise taxes? Sorry, higher taxes would damage my life, hate speech!

Not saying that all of these examples would be sentenced guilty, but they could be prosecuted if you set the criterion to ""anything that might damage"". You can see how this trail of events could lead to a collapse in democracy and individual freedom. 

This is why I believe hate speech laws should only forbid calls for, and threats of, physical violence against individuals and groups, as well as harassment and coordinated smears (psychological violence). If the act being investigated is against a protected category of people, or the identity of the person is the object of the attack, the charges faced are worse (i.e. saying ""I will kill you, faggot"" is worse than ""I will kill you""). 

Again, I understand where you are coming from and really simpathize with you. It's just that, foe me, hate speech laws can easily creep into other speech, with the consequence being that free speech is severely restricted and we lose one of our most fundamental and most fought-for rights as citizens.

320,"&gt;So maybe, just maybe, the fact that we don't have the level of racial tension you guys have (also reflected in Europe) means hate speech laws are actually effective?

It's because we're a violent people, plain and simple. I'm originally from the deep south, but I've never experienced anything in my life that I can lay at the feet of racism. Maybe because I'm white, I dunno, but racial tension is stoked by poverty, not free speech laws. 

Americans are just more violent as a people, and that's due more to the lack of a decent social system than the fact that the Klan can hold a parade. Universal healthcare and education would solve most of our social problems in the US, and in fact it's the reason I've lived in Europe for the past decade or so and also why I won't move back until the US adopts such a system. I firmly believe it is the key to resolving most of our serious social issues. It's not hate speech laws that ban freedom of speech that reduce racial tension, it's the social systems in place that take away the fear and desperation that push people to their breaking point. I live in Italy and I see this every day; it's not like there aren't fascists or racists or bigots here, and it's not like Italy's hate speech laws have curbed anything. Like I said, it's just made it all more insidious, so instead of seeing it head-on, it surprises you because you don't see it coming. 

&gt; I have never been witness to people advocating violence or murder of Americans

Again, advocating violence or murder of anyone in the US is illegal. It's REALLY illegal. Go to jail illegal. US hate speech laws do not protect that, they protect the right to insult people with nasty, hateful language, that's all it is. What the groups stand for in secret may be another thing, but as long as they aren't expressing that publicly, they are protected by the First Amendment. 

&gt;You should be conscientious of the fact that the majority of criticism I see leveled at the United States is related to the fact that often you guys don't live up to your promise on the world stage. I can give you plenty of examples if you want.

You don't have to, I'm not here to defend the many mistakes the US has made, and I am a strong critic myself. I mean, I did take up residence in a foreign country, after all. I'm just here to debate the issue of hate speech.

The anti-Americanism comment surprised you, didn't it? You had to actually stop and think about it for a second, didn't you? I see it every day. We've been dehumanized as a people because everyone's just used to railing against us and using us as their scapegoat for all the world's problems. It's true that the US fucks up a whole lot, but it's also true that it doesn't, but you'll never convince anyone of that. 

This is what happens when they dehumanize you as a country: you just become part of this faceless machine to them and any explanation that doesn't coincide with their preconceived notions is immediately jettisoned. Now take that feeling and send it through social media on the internet where everyone has an opinion, and highlight only the perceived mistakes without giving any reasoning or context whatsoever, and you have a perfect storm for hatred and bigotry and even violence against an entire people. And nobody even notices because it's fun to hate Americans. Not only that, it's encouraged by entire cultures, from the citizen to the politician: it's ok to hate the United States of America and the Americans who dwell there because they deserve it. Why? Because they voted for an embarrassing politician who may not even make it to the end of his first four year term. The irony of this is the anti-Americanism hasn't gone up since Trump; everyone hated us just as much during the Obama administration, so what does that say? That says that bigotry is ok only when it's against Americans. 

Do an experiment: listen for all the hateful shit you hear about Americans. Not about Trump, not about some idiot they saw on Jimmy Kimmel who can't find Australia on a globe, just ""Americans"". Listen to what people say. Don't get involved, just let them talk. Let them rant. Let them fire each other up and listen to how the conversation goes from ""America bad"" to, ""I wish someone would just destroy the US so the world would be rid of it"" or ""Americans are the scum of the Earth and should all be sterilized"" and so on.

This is why we have hate speech laws, and we believe that those people should be able to say those things, as horrible as they may be. ",,/r/europe/comments/9rauo0/switzerland_rules_transphobia_and_homophobia/e8gdjau/,doomblackdeath,1540507135

361,"&gt;The international agreement on naval territories and more specifically mentions that countries have the right on an NEZ of 12nm.

You have to sign that first. Turkey is not obligated to sign it. 

&gt;In the past though to prevent issues about it, there has been (I think it was unwritten) agreements between Greece and Turkey that Greece will keep to 6nm near Turkey's borders, and Turkey won't cause issues over the islands.

I would like to see an article about that, because that would be news to me. 

&gt;Yet Erdogan keeps on pushing that Turkey should own several of Greece's islands

Never happened. 

&gt;which are nowhere near have an legimate claim besides in the head of the Turkish government.

Turkey agreed on the borders with Greece in the agreement of Lausanne. 

&gt;So this is more kinda like an pushback from Greece after multiple years of Erdogan's fear- and warmongering. In this case only Greece is right.

That´s some hardcore bending right there. There is simply no interest or any kind of disbute about anything important. There might be some disbute about some rocks, but besides that, neither Turkey wants any greek territory, nor was there even an attempt to get any greek territory. 

Nothing is stopping Turkey to occupy some islands close to the turkish coast. Currently the army is even in Syria, Iraq and Cyprus. You can´t possibly argue that there is anything stopping Turkey regarding the aegan. 

Also:

&gt;like an pushback from Greece 

Assuming for a moment that all of your claims are right: How is that an appropiate action? This will just worsen the relationships with all turks and all upcoming governments.

There are strategic benefits to be had by doing the extension. That's why Greece wants to do it. So it *does* benefit us.

 Turkey stands to lose from said extension. That's why Turkey doesnt want Greece to do it. 

The ""right"" is not a moral one, it's -arguably- a legal one. We do not deserve it because we're ""Greeks"" nor should you lose it because you're ""Turks"". The law -that you do not subscribe to though,  but we do - gives us the *right* to do the extension. Since you do not subscribe to that law, you're not the ""baddies"" (well, apart from actually threatening war) either. It's simply a case where our interests are opposing.


There's nothing in here about spite, about hate, about our past history. 

Will our government/military be glad should it passes that Turkey loses their ability to conduct navy excersises in the Aegean? 

Sure. But that's not the real reason, because it pales in comparison  to the actual gains.

You know, France, for a country that is always concerned about encroaching American culture, you sure seem comfortable with John Birch Society stuff.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order_(conspiracy_theory)

&gt;The New World Order or NWO is claimed to be an emerging clandestine totalitarian world government by various conspiracy theories.[3][4][5][6][7]
&gt;
&gt;The common theme in conspiracy theories about a New World Order is that a secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government—which will replace sovereign nation-states—and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails the establishment of the New World Order as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been purported to be part of a cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies, at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination.[3][4][5][6][7]
&gt;
&gt;Before the early 1990s, New World Order conspiracism was limited to two American countercultures, primarily the militantly anti-government right and secondarily that part of fundamentalist Christianity concerned with the end-time emergence of the Antichrist.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9r90hs/call_for_a_europe_of_solidarity_for_a_europe/e8g57kk/,vokegaf,1540499719

The KLAs purpose was not to attack or defeat Yugoslavia. It was the independence or autonomy of Kosovo. They achieved their goal therefore they were successful. Also its disingenuous to imply they never won a battle, you can wiki search for the battles won by either side. Were they stellar? Course not, they were a bunch of civs armed with stolen guns from Albania and barely a month of training in some cases. 

&gt;So now you're claiming there thousands more dead Albanians and that their bodies have been hidden? I'm willing to believe the number is by maybe 100, but more than that seems far fetched.

There are some couple thousands lost. They are to this day referred as that : Lost. There is a monument about them in Kosovo. Now if 2 mass graves discovered had somewhere around 100 bodies in them that already dilutes this point.

&gt;And I'm not arguing that more Serbs died, I'm arguing that the claims of genocide and us wanting to kill all Albanians are simply wrong and that ultimately the KLA was no better than we were. That's all I'm arguing, and that's what the original comment was about. That guy claimed we wanted to kill all of Kosovo's Albanians, the fact that we only killed 0,52% of them in 4 years clearly proves we did not.

Milosevics goal was not to kill all albanians, his goal was to erase albanians from Yugoslavia. First he removed autonomy, then he removed albanian from the state, then he fired albanians from all jobs and army. Then he pushed for albanian exodus in various ways and for the ""colonization"" of Kosovo by pushing random villagers to settle. All of which are well documented. The fact that they destroyed as many Kullas,Villages and libraries as possible is evident to what their end goal was. What he wanted to do was the total eradication of anything Albanian from the region, like we never existed. That is worse than killing us.

441,"Article text due to the paywall:

The president of a student union at one of Britain’s leading universities has apologised after saying that she wished to paint over a 100-year-old picture commemorating the fallen in the First World War because it contained white men.

Emily Dawes, who is running the University of Southampton students’ union during a break from her astrophysics degree, declared that she would take down the 10ft by 4ft work that hangs in a meeting room on the university’s Highfield campus.

Ms Dawes, who is white, was attending an event that was part of Black History Month when she wrote: “Mark my words — we’re taking down the mural of white men in the uni Senate room, even if I have to paint over it myself.”

The event was not held in the Senate Room but she has attended other meetings there as part of her duties as president. The message was part of a series she posted on Twitter during another event named All Things Black. One of them read: “As white people, we are so ignorant and closed minded without even realising it. Listen to your black friends/colleagues/students and ask how you can be the ally they want!”

The painting in question is The Rothenstein Mural, painted by William Rothenstein in 1916 that shows dignitaries from numerous universities conferring an honour on an unknown soldier. Rothenstein, a former principal of the Royal College of Art, depicted 28 people in the portrait including Robert Bridges, then the poet laureate.

The artist’s son gave the painting to the university in 1959 and it was displayed in the staff club room before being rededicated in 2014 to commemorate the centenary of the start of the First World War. Emily Dawes had said it was irrelevant that Armistice Day was imminent Emily Dawes had said it was irrelevant that Armistice Day was imminent

Ms Dawes, who was head of the university’s feminist society before being elected this year to lead the students’ union, lives in London but attended school in the US. She said in another tweet that she was aware that Armistice Day on November 11 was imminent but that this was irrelevant. She posted an image of the mural with the caption: “One of the women just said, ‘It’s nearly Armistice Day so are we covering up this tapestry??’ And Holy Shit. F*** Yes. Grl Pwr.”

Her declaration prompted strong criticism from the local MP and from the artist’s grandchildren. Lucy Carter, 84, the artist’s granddaughter, who lives in Crewkerne, Somerset, said: “I think it’s very sad, people trying to change history. It’s sad that people should be overtaken by these concerns. Painting over it would be unnecessary.”

Julian Rothenstein, the artist’s grandson, who runs a publishing business in London, said: “It seems ridiculous, utterly ludicrous to me.”

Ms Dawes’s union distanced itself from her remarks. “We apologise for the recent statement from our president regarding The Rothenstein Mural and any upset this may have caused,” it said.

Ms Dawes wrote an apology on Twitter this afternoon. “I would like to apologise for the offense and upset I have caused with what I have said,” she wrote. “I never meant the disrespect to anyone past, present and future. I had no intention of the tweet being taken literally, and upon reflection have realised how inappropriate it was.

“My intention was to promote strong, female leadership and not the eradication and disrespect of history. I do not believe that to make progress in the future, we should look to erase the past.”

Royston Smith, the MP for Southampton Itchen, said that Ms Dawes’s declaration about the painting was in poor taste. Mr Smith, 54, who served in the RAF for ten years, said: “It is disappointing, especially as we approach the centenary of the Armistice, that the president of the student’s union feels it is acceptable to disregard the heroic sacrifice of soldiers who sought to defend the very freedoms, including free speech, which Miss Dawes has chosen to exercise. With freedom comes responsibility, and considering the president of the student’s union holds a position of authority she has clearly overstepped the mark.

“I hope she will reflect on what she has said and realise it has been conducted in poor taste. Those who know the history of our island are fully aware and appreciate the involvement of black and Asian soldiers against tyranny.”",,/r/europe/comments/9re315/feminist_student_emily_dawes_apologises_for/e8g5k3a/,JohnKimble111,1540500056

IIRC It also had better grade than the Eurofighter in different bid (Netherland, Swiss, Brasil, Corea, Singapour and India).",France,/r/europe/comments/9r9tit/belgium_confirms_choice_of_lockheeds_f35_over/e8g5xjj/,E404BikeNotFound,1540500410
487,"&gt; but do at the very least implicitly call for discrimination

I can't agree with that.

We all have some characteristics that are different from others. I am left handed - just because someone will say to me it is not normal it does not mean he explicitly or implicitly call for violence or discrimination against me.

Another example - my sister have both eyes with different colour. Some people find it weird and unnatural. If they will say to her they think it is illness it is mean and shitty thing to do - but it is not hate speech and they should be allowed to say their opinion. 

And just to be clear I strongly believe calling for discrimination and/or violence is wrong and should be punished. But I am also sure that preventing free discussion and expression of opinions is never good idea and never end up good (many examples in history).",,/r/europe/comments/9rauo0/switzerland_rules_transphobia_and_homophobia/e8g5xjp/,Morgana81,1540500410

497,"&gt; ""Far""? No. One usually leads into the other. For the sake of argument, however, we can agree to disagree on this point; it's not really material to my point. I consider either dangerous; promoting violence and undermining the democratic order.

Using the dictionary definition of fascism, for example [here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism) there isnt anything about racism or populism, fascism/nazizm is so much worse than that, thats why I said its far from it. 

&gt; Apart from being somewhat misleading (right-wing criminality had spiked massively in the years before, so a drop even by 13% in one year should not be overestimated), it should be noted that 

I disagree, I wasnt suggesting there was a trend of it going down or anything like that, simply you claimed its rising, I gave an example where it fell in the last year. **IF** this becomes a trend, those 2 lines from your graph will meet up relatively quick.

&gt; This means, in conclusion:

&gt; * Right-wing incidents have dropped somewhat, but still massively outnumber left-wing crime

&gt; * Right-wing violent incidents have risen, with simple propaganda delicts having become less significant

&gt; * Left-wing violent incidents have dropped

And that the total number of violent acts motivated by:

* right-wing politics = 1,698 

* left-wing committed = 1,702 

&gt; So what should the average German citizen be more concerned about, I ask?

Exactly, what should they be worried about if the number of violent crimes from both sides was almost identical? Do you know the numbers for 2017?

&gt; Maybe I'm just out of the loop. What kind of threat do you see from the far left, exactly?

Just look at the above number. 

&gt; Not really. I just can't help but notice a certain readiness among parts of the populace to ignore the one side that is louder, more aggressive, and more violent. Most notably, this level of tolerance - normalization - has also allowed them to make their messages more popular and increase their reach, having a hand in the rise of various right-wing politicians in Europe and in the US.

I disagree with this whole premise that fascism/nazizm is being normalized, its not and I havent seen anything to confirm that. On the other hand I have seen how those terms are being more and more  incorrectly thrown around. Hell, Ive been called a fascist a couple time in the last year, simply for referring to the the actual definition of the word and pointing out when someone stupidly calls someone/something fascist/nazi.

&gt; Gamergate, Pizzagate, Charlottesville ... wake me up when the horrible extreme left conspiracy that gets invoked again and again throughout decades of history actually gets its act together instead of being content with kicking over trash cans and burning cars, whilst the right-wingers consolidate political support, murder or maim their opponents and radicalize the political debate.

Oh please, this is not one sided as you like to present it. radicalization and violence is happening on both sides. Violence? Republican shot at baseball practice. Radicalization? Clinton talking about how you dont have to be civilized towards Republicans, etc. Even when you look at Poland, PiS is supposedly the violent, hateful and dangerous one. but in recent history we had 1 serious attack on a political office and it was one of theirs in Lodz, a PiS member was killed and another seriously injured during it.

596,"&gt; And? 56 years ago laws of physics or basic geopolitics were different and nuclear missiles were deadlier than now or what?

I believe the laws of physics are constant, at least in this universe.

And yes, geopolitics *were* different 56 years ago. The geopolitical landscape has changed &amp; what is considered acceptable has too. Russia would not put nuclear missiles in Cuba, and Cuba would not accept them.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Also US routinely starts a war almost every year.

That's hyperbole.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;  Nicely smiling Nobel Peace Prize winning Obama was leading 7 wars.

Not a fan of President Obama or him being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for giving amazing speeches, but which 7 wars was President Obama leading? The Iraqi insurgency, the War in Afghanistan, the Lybia intervention, and arguably Syria? What are these 3 other wars the U.S. was in lead of?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; says that it will deploy it's nuclear missiles near your border

I don't recall the U.S. saying that.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; what would be a sane reaction to that?

De-escalation? The U.S. hasn't initiated a nuclear attack since 1945 (and understandingly then). The U.S. public, let alone its allies, wouldn't abide a nuclear strike accept in the most extreme of circumstances, and no American president would want that kind of stain on their conscience.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; May be saying ""don't do it you are provoking nuclear war, nuclear war is bad, remember?"" No?

Oh, yes. Totally agree with that. In Russia's case, there is a [substantial push](http://nvo.ng.ru/concepts/2015-11-27/1_stairway.html) to modify their nuclear doctrine to allow for limited tactical strikes. The general idea is that the era of MAD is over; the United States would never trade New York for Riga, and should a tactical nuclear attack be launched on Ramstein or the Sulawesi Gap? NATO would be scared of a Russia so brazen, or so the arguments have gone. Thank God the Kremlin has, at least in public, not bought into that idea.

&amp;nbsp;

Russia is in its irredentist &amp; revanchist phase. The Kremlin, at least, feels Russia has been unjustly robbed &amp; humiliated, therefore justifying their actions as for the good of the nation. That worries her neighbors, who have no clear idea how what Russia wants &amp; how far it is willing to go to get it.

There's the IMF that helps anyone and it's quite possible that the EU or China or the US will bail out Serbia anyway.      

 Saying Serbia's economy won't last a decade is very stupid considering Serbia's economy has already lasted decades without EU help and there are over a hundred economies out of the EU not crashing.    Saying that Serbia not being accepted into the EU is blackmail is stupid and false and does not correspond to what that word means.

643,"&gt; And the abuse is large scale because there are many laws stifling fredom of expresison austria, some leading to jail time.

You mean this guy?: 
&gt;After Irving denied the Holocaust in two 1989 speeches given in Austria, the Austrian government issued an arrest warrant for him **and barred him from entering the country.**[101] In early 1992, a German court found him guilty of Holocaust denial under the Auschwitzlüge section of the law against Volksverhetzung (a failed appeal by Irving would see the fine rise from 10,000 DM to 30,000 DM), and he was subsequently barred from entering Germany.[16] Other governments followed suit, including Italy and Canada,[102] where he was arrested in November 1992 and deported to the United Kingdom.[16] In an administrative hearing surrounding those events, he was found by the hearing office to have engaged in a ""total fabrication"" in telling a story of an exit from and return to Canada which would, for technical reasons, have made the original deportation order invalid. He was also barred from entering Australia in 1992, a ban he made five unsuccessful attempts to overturn.[103]
...
&gt;**On 11 November 2005, the Austrian police in the southern state of Styria, acting under the 1989 warrant, arrested Irving.** Irving pleaded guilty to the charge of ""trivialising, grossly playing down and denying the Holocaust"". Irving stated in his plea that he changed his opinions on the Holocaust, ""I said that then based on my knowledge at the time, but by 1991 when I came across the Eichmann papers, I wasn't saying that anymore and I wouldn't say that now. The Nazis did murder millions of Jews."" Irving had obtained the papers from Hugo Byttebier, a Belgian who had served in the SS during the war and had escaped to Argentina.[115] Irving was sentenced to three years' imprisonment in accordance with the law prohibiting National Socialist activities (officially Verbotsgesetz, ""Prohibition Statute"").[116] Irving sat motionless as judge Peter Liebetreu asked him if he had understood the sentence, to which he replied ""I'm not sure I do"" before being bundled out of the court by Austrian police. Later, Irving declared himself shocked by the severity of the sentence. He had reportedly already purchased a plane ticket home to London.[117]

&gt;In December 2006, Irving was released from prison, and banned from ever returning to Austria.[118] Upon Irving's arrival in the UK he reaffirmed his position, stating that he felt ""no need any longer to show remorse"" for his Holocaust views.[119] On 18 May 2007, he was expelled from the 52nd Warsaw International Book Fair in Poland because books he took there were deemed by the organizers as promoting Nazism and antisemitism, which is in violation of Polish law.[120] 

He is not only a sick person but veritably stupid. And if you refer to him you are of the same mentally ill disposition.

But this ruling is a big fucking deal. Don’t see it on cnn or bbc.

Trumps policy towards Europe has been good for us on multiple front, to get our heads out our arses. It’s not just this.

He put sanctions on turkey for illegal detention of foreign citizens. Has openly critisised oppressive non western values. Sorry not all cultures in terms of personal freedoms are equal.

Europe has been laxidasical. They do not even protect their own resources. Cyprus sovereign gas is being threatened by turkey. The Eu ‘big players’ respond by giving ‘bail outs’ and closer unity with turkey.. 

It’s the Americans that send warships to protect exxonmobiles interests in Cyprus.

Islam has been making gains in Europe and attacking everything that is not negotiable. Including free speech.

So although I started thinking trump was prude and even a racist. The truth is, he was right all along. Myself not being a nationalist but rather a globalist I should be at odds with trump? Well yes and no.

657,"Yes ny argument was in the past used to justify racism and slavery. But my point is that the vegan argument is the same, just with another arbitrary line in the sand (animal instead of human). Because in the end there will always be some trade-off and to help X you need to harm Y. I choose the separation at human, racists in the past put it at white people, vegans put it at sentient or animals.

And there will always be moral inconsistencies, no matter what you choose to do. If moral was easy we wouldn't have over 2000 years of philosophers arguing about it.

If you want to go to hypothetical edge cases would it be more moral for a vegan to eat a GMO animal that was never sentient and can't feel anything or eat a plant that was made able to feel pain ? There are no clear answers in my opinion but here the meat eater as myself wouldn't see any isssue in both case since we are far from my line.

So in my opinion, the moral argument for veganism is poor because there are no moral truth to base your choice around, just arbitrary line in the sand. However the ecological argument is solid and I fully take responsability for my weakness and shortsightness here.","BZH, Bienvenue en Zone Humide",/r/europe/comments/9qs21w/baby_cows_stabbed_in_front_of_each_other_sold_as/e8fnqus/,C0ldSn4p,1540485736

About this case: 

&gt;Stating that the court had found that ""the applicant's statements had been likely to arouse justified indignation in Muslims"" and ""amounted to a generalization without factual basis"", the ECtHR said that the woman's comments could not be covered by the freedom of expression.

Lol. First of all that woman accused a historic figured from 1500 years ago for being a pedophile, it's not like she said all Muslims are pedophiles. As for the factual basis it's right there in the fucking Quran. It doesn't even matter if it's true or not, because Muslims certainly think it is, because it's their fucking bible! 

But I don't even have to make this argument. It's just too obvious to point out the double standards here, if someone says something bad about Christians, no one gives the slightest shit, say something bad about Muslims, well then you're fucked, cuz' you'll be stuck between a rock (angry Jihadis) and a hard place (leftist animals).

&amp;#x200B;

Properties are often sold on 99 year leases, the thing is, many of these properties have changed hand multiple times over the decades and the leases are down to 30-60 years left. In this situation its plausible the lease might run out during the occupants lifetime. In theory this means the property would revert to the freeholder, and presumably the person living in the flat would be asked to purchase a new 99 year lease at full market rates of $400,000 or so. The government who owns most of these properties however is facing pressure from its citizens not to do this, many citizens paid a large sum for the house, without taking into the account the low number of years left on the lease. They are afraid that they won't be able to buy the property again when the lease runs out around the same time they are retiring.

&amp;#x200B;

An example might be someone bought a house with a 50 year lease, when they were 25. When they reach age 75 in retirement, the lease will expire, meaning they will cease to be the owner of their property anymore. But often they have not budgeted money to pay rent during retirement or buy another home. In theory the government will evict that pensioner making them homeless if they don’t have savings to afford both rent and living costs, but this looks bad politically and elderly voters make up lots of voters so its uncertain what the government will choose to do.",,/r/europe/comments/9r1kjg/eu_home_ownership_rates/e8f23n6/,Acnmq11,1540464184

952,"&gt; The thing is that large industrial areas weren’t the main point of focus during the bombings. During the raid the focus laid on the city center which wasn’t used much for industry.

That's something the RAF learned from Luftwaffe attacks on the UK. From the Luftwaffe's orders: 

&gt;In addition to destruction of industrial targets, it is important to hinder the carrying out of reconstruction works and the resumption of manufacturing by wiping out the most densely populated workers' settlements.

From briefings to Churchill's war cabinet following the raid:

&gt;the fact that the attack had been concentrated on the centre of the city and that far less damage had been done to the factories, which were mainly on the outskirts of the city.

and

&gt;On the whole damage to munitions production was less extensive than had been feared. Work was considerably impeded by damage to public utilities. The water and gas positions were both bad, but the main structure of the electricity supply remained.

And some time after the raid:

&gt;We are also having difficulties about machine tools. These do not spring
from the actual damage done to the tools. On the contrary, it has been found
that the machine tool stands up to the blast of the bomb remarkably well.
In the attack on Coventry, where 50,000 machine tools were concentrated,
only 700 were destroyed. In Birmingham, where as many as 70,000 were
assembled, 700 were destroyed.
But while the machine tools in our possession might give very good results
when the men worked them by night as well as by day, it is now very hard to
persuade staffs in some centres to do night duty.
The general effect has been to cut down the proportion of men employed on
night work. In many directions night shifts have been abandoned.

And from a US diplomat, reporting back to the US Secretary of State:

&gt;The big raid on Coventry took place during the night of November
14-15, 1940. Since that time some weeks have elapsed and great
strides have been made in the direction of make-shift repairs
to damaged working-class residences. But there is not a sizeable
industrial enterprise in the whole of Coventry whose production
is not still being adversely affected by raiding has wrought
in the lives of Coventry working people. There hovers over that
city an apprehensiveness which has lingered since the raid took
place. This apprehensiveness is born of a realization that the
Germans can at will again do to Coventry what they did to it
during that one horrible night in November.

&gt;Intricate, costly, and heavy machine tools can be extricated
from the cellars of demolished manufacturing plants. Many of
them can be repaired and installed in new plant. But the workers
who man these machines, so long as they live as they do today,
can never attain the efficiency which, before the events in question
took place, they maintained as a mere matter of course.

Having been on the receiving end of German attacks for many months, that killed tens of thousands of people, the British experience was that damage to a city from an area attack was much worse than damage to individual factories. That's what informed British tactics later in the war (and eventually USAAF tactics as well).",,/r/europe/comments/9r6sv7/visited_dresden_and_caught_this_spec_of_colour_on/e8f26vu/,WhiteSatanicMills,1540464341

What I know is that we delivered a ""permis de séjour"" (which gives the right to stay in France) to 262 000 (so that does not includes the illegal migrant). That's 13,7% more than in 2016, and the number of migrant we welcome is growing since the very start of the migrant crisis. So it's a lot.

Among this number, the number of refugees has blown: 35% more than last year, wich make them be more than 100 000 for the first time. The fact that for you we are ""hypocritical"" is because the number of people we don't accept at our border has doubled since last year. But that's mainly because they are a lot more migrants this year than last year, not because we stopped welcoming them.

Actually, many french want to stop welcoming them: as you said, we were terrible at integrating migrant, and now the grandchildren of the migrant (we always had many migrants) are a big problem (they are poor, victim of racism, violent...) but we don't stopped yet.

Finally... well I can really argue with the whole complotist idea that we take only doctors and engineers... Of course, that's donne with the ""economical migrant"" (those who come here for a job), but not for the refugees. But yeah... you can't argue with a complotist idea, that's the point of those idea.

1020,"&gt;In any case, I find it incredibly far fetched to draw the conclusion that people knew what monstrosity the EU would become, based on a few lines of political unity, closeness and solidarity

Specifically the present form of the EU? Nobody did. But that a path was set for further moves towards a more united Europe is something that seemed clear in the articles I read. The specific form of this ""united Europe"" is of course something no one was clear about. It's more about intent than specific form by this point in time.

&gt;I make her responsible for the crisis becoming European and growing out of control.

The article that you posted doesn't really prove the position.  The article mainly talks about the suspension of the 1990 protocol, which wasn't being enforced by this point anyway. The member states of arrival were just passing on refugees to the rest of Europe. Either Merkel tried to stop the flow at the borders (which would have failed like it did anywhere else) or open the borders. 

The turning point where migrants were given a free reign to push into Europe was much earlier than you think, when the border states proved completely unable to stop migrants from entering illegally. Neither ""bouncing around"" Orban-style (more acuratly described as giving illegals a lift to go into any other country that isn't Hungary) or following protocals was working. That's why we had a crisis in the first place.

Lets go trough you post here.

&gt;No, for solving the problem of an ageing population this would have been a stupid move. The refugees are way to little qualified and face severe problems of cultural integration.

I dont know how to repopulate aging population than with people that tend to have 3-4 or more children.

Refugees,unless you are hardcore xenophobe,are people like you,that go to school,highschool,and then to university in some cases.Thinking that German education system is better than 3rd world country one is falling when you just take a glance on how much easter european doctors Germany imports every year.

&gt;To fill the problem of an ageing population you need a different strategy. Such as offering an extra 50000 EUR to properly qualified migrants who are willing to move to Germany longterm. This is a more successful approach and a cheaper one.

OOOOOOOOOOOOOR

Bring millions of them on their own expense,check their education background,pick what you need,and give them jobs.

Keep the rest on wellfare for a while to not make this human selection obvious and than request from member states for lets say ""refugee"" quotas.

&gt;Doesn't make sense at all. Germany never dumped any excess all over Europe. And never intended so.

Oh wait that happened allready.

&gt;The refugee crisis in 2015 started when Greece and Italy could not handle the influx of refugees anymore.

Bull shit.

If there was a clear EU message to Greece to stop boats,boats would be stopped.Simple as fucking that.Same goes for Italy and Italy is no new to this problem since they have such a coast they get invaded and are dealing with this issue for decades.

&gt;Not true. Noone prevented Greece and Italy from protecting their border.

They also bombed the Großer Garten, a park, which was used to house refugees at that time but that’s another story. 
 
Churchill himself said that “The destruction of Dresden remains a serious query against the conduct of Allied bombing.” and that he felt “the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives such as oil and communications behind the immediate battle-zone, rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction, however impressive.”

We should also offer ways to make using environmental friendly ways profitable.

Why not just put a tax on straws, if it is actually polluting a lot when correctly recycled?

1454,"In Romania, it's pretty much a mixture of the following:

1. The majority of Romanians from urban areas live in commie blocks. Before 1990, all of these commie blocks belonged to the state. After 1990, when communism collapsed, the government wanted to get rid of these commie blocks fast, so they offered the people who were living in them the option to buy them, really cheap. I'm talking $800-1000 for an apartment cheap. But ofc, these prices were only available to the people who were already living there, so it wasn't like one guy with more money could buy an entire city. So, as you can imagine, lots of people bought their apartments from the state. 

2. Before 1990 there were around 300,000 Germans living in Romania. After 1990, most went to Germany, so they sold their houses, again really cheap. The price for a house in Timisoara at that time was between 10.000 and 30.000 DM, in smaller cities and towns it was much cheaper.  

3. It's a cultural thing. If you don't get married and buy your own house or apartment, you are seen as a failure. Also, most parents will at least partially pay for their children's homes, many will pay for it entirely. Government programs like ""first home"" also help, because young people can get loans of up to €70,000 which are backed by the government.

4. Those who are too poor to afford their own home will generally live in their parents' house forever. It's not uncommon in Romania to see houses where three or sometimes even four generations live under the same roof, in fact this used to be sort of the norm in rural areas, at least until all the young people from the countryside went to work abroad.

1486,"The previous lines are about growing up and becoming a hussar. The circled part says that ""indeed I'll do this, then marry Kata, she's gonna work and I'm gonna sleep, then beat her at night"".

The weird part is that they chose this version of the folk song (it's the lyrics of a folk song) instead of the milder, child-friendly one AND they stopped here. It goes on. The dude becomes a Hussar, comes home from battle, marries a girl, sleeps as long as he wants and can beat his wife - then falls ill, gets treated. After that it goes on in first person but tells about the girl's side who is also small, wants to grow up, then continues in first person (the singer's gender goes unspecified), saying that the singer grows up (""go out from the bowl like the dough""), grows flowers, becomes stronger than his/her parents, so strong then (s)he can beat up giants and take their castles, becomes a hero, so rich that (s)he gives golden dwellings to all his/her siblings, then the last verse is that (s)he will be happy and the best person on the whole planet.

I actually checked the details and it's supposed to be about the children daydreaming about growing up and becoming strong and heroic and an adult based on what they see but decide that instead it's enough to just be good and happy. (That kinda explains the husband's control over the wife, too. Growing up, from a kid's perspective means that you can do whatever you want.)

But the book cuts it off right at the part when the hussar, coming home from battle, is beating his wife. Why on earth? In folk traditions the elders actually explained such stuff but what is the plan here - is the teacher supposed to explain the whole thing with over half of the lyrics missing...?

It's all about exposure to information and how it frames one's worldview: off the top of my head, I think Hungary has the lowest rate of being conversational in a foreign language. Some 25% reports they are that in English, but how many of them are active speakers who could jump into a discussion like this one without much sweat is anyone's guess, but probably not more than half or so. 

You've probably also heard about our media landscape and how state-funded propaganda is the norm now. Well, the independent media's total reach is estimated at around 3 million people out of 9.7. That's another enormous portion of people in the dark, being conditioned by not much else than their day-to-day life experiences and the government influence they encounter there. 

If someone Western would systematically examine the communication tactics of Fidesz, their first though would be how rudimentary it is and question whether this was aimed at cavemen. That's what's proven to work with people who don't have much disposable mental capacity to orient themselves in the work, because they barely manage to do that in their own lives. They want simple questions with simple answers. 

Any country worth living in has societies where this isn't a norm, and where the majority of citizens have proper agency, and are their own individual persons.

Most property developers in the 5 or 7 magnet cities are former Securitate oligarchs, and now you understand why the state of Romania's road and rail infrastructure is what it is... because it creates demand for apartments and an opportunity to make fortunes off of mortgage serfs who need to sleep one hour away from where they work, which in Romanian terms is less than 30 kilometers.

Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union

Title VIII

Article 126:
&gt;1) Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.

&gt;2) The Commission shall monitor the development of the budgetary situation and of the stock of government debt in the Member States with a view to identifying gross errors. In particular it shall examine compliance with budgetary discipline on the basis of the following two criteria:

&gt;(a) whether the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to gross domestic product exceeds a reference value, unless:

&gt;- either the ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes close to the reference value,

&gt;- or, alternatively, the excess over the reference value is only exceptional and temporary and the ratio remains close to the reference value;

&gt;(b) whether the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product exceeds a reference value, unless the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace.

&gt;The reference values are specified in the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaties.

&gt;3) If a Member State does not fulfil the requirements under one or both of these criteria, the Commission shall prepare a report. The report of the Commission shall also take into account whether the government deficit exceeds government investment expenditure and take into account all other relevant factors, including the medium-term economic and budgetary position of the Member State.

&gt;If you read the article, you’d know that Italy isn’t even violating the 3% rule, and even if they did the Commission has no authority to stop them. France routinely violated the 3% rule and faced no repercussions.

The issue is not the violation the 3% rule but that Italy has a debt-to-GDP of 130% and are doing a massive deviation from the planned budget amount. Second, and the most important factor in this is what they are choosing to spend this deficit on, which is tax amnesty, pensions, and other social welfare. If Italy was running a deficit on things that actually improve GDP growth then they wouldn't have their budget rejected. This is the difference between Italy's budget and other member states. 

If you still don't understand consider this: ""My brother used our dad's credit card for tuition so why is he upset that I spent it on sushi?""

&gt;And I say they hate Keynes because the EU has followed the German example and completely rejected the notion that deficit spending is an effective way to bring economies out of slumps.

I agree completely that deficit spending on investment, infrastructure, and education are exactly what Italy needs to bring their economy out of its slump. But that is not what they are spending it on. They are not in line with Keynes. If they were the EU wouldn't reject the budget. 

You're basing all your assumptions on the idea that this Italian deficit will grow the economy just because its a deficit and not focusing on what they are actually spending money on.

&gt;Of course, *one might reasonably argue that Western investment enabled the productivity of the economies concerned to increase and therefore everyone benefited.* But the East European leaders never miss an opportunity to recall that investors take advantage of their position of strength to keep wages low and maintain excessive margins (see e.g. this recent interview with the Czech prime minister).

&gt;In the same way as with Greece, the leading economic powers tend on the contrary to consider inequality as natural. They work on the assumption that the market and ‘free competition’ contribute to a fair distribution of wealth and consider the transfers resulting from this ‘natural’ balance as an act of generosity on the part of the winners in the system. *In reality, property relations are always complex,* particularly within large-scale political communities like the EU, and cannot be regulated uniquely by the goodwill of the market.

Both of these also state along the lines of ""detected in europe"" not new arrivals. Not ""cumulatively to the previous years total"". The same way the original article cites. You put something in quotes though, where is that from?

&gt;Last year, 618,780 non-EU citizens were illegally present in the EU. This figure is dropped 71% compared with the peak of 2015. (euronews article)

Otherwise, don't you have a problem with the internal consistency of your argument? If those are 'novel illegal migrants', meaning the total would sit at around *6million* illegal refugees, and that the amount of detections of illegal migrants, far outstrips illegal border crossings? Are we recording illegal births of illegal migrants? You can't have massively fewer illegal crossings than novel illegal refugees...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis

I'm also interested, how would the EU keep a running track of who is a new illegal migrant, and who was tallied the previous year?

If they found 2mil one year, and 600 thousand the next, did they really have the records of 2.6million refugees at the end of the year? Are the illegal refugees giving them contact information for follow ups?

Seeing as you give of a reasonably strong anti-migration vibe... Isn't this welcome news to you? The problem is going away?

Nice job poisoning the well! Duly noted as the vapid and antisocial posturing that it is.

&gt; They removed the upload filters from the language but describe a bunch of requirements that can only be solved realistically by upload filters.

Either you haven't actually read the directive, you're cherry picking or you've become convinced by people who do.

They didn't remove the upload filters from the language. They moved it to the bit where it says that ""automated blocking of content is [to be] avoided."" But just pretty words, right? Easier said than done. Fine. One of the requirements states that: ""Cooperation between online content service providers and right holders shall not lead to preventing the availability of non-infringing works or other protected subject matter, including those covered by an exception or limitation to copyright.""

The burden that this directive puts on copyright providers and large media platforms is to find a way to distinguish non-infringing works from infringing works. That's not possible with ""just"" filters. I'm not saying that this is definitely the reason why YouTube is against this Directive, but it's a damn good reason because it'll be a tall order to fulfill.

So no, your memes are not in danger. Don't worry, you can still post a picture with a caption in Impact font.

Absolute nonsense. False flagging is caused by *mass* flagging and copyright bullies who can do this because there are no laws punishing the abuse of such systems.

1650,"&gt; ROMA (Reuters) - One of the most radical proposals in the programme of Italy’s anti-establishment coalition is to issue securities to pay off individuals and companies who are owed money by the state as payment for services or as tax rebates.

&gt;  Following are some questions and answers about the so-called “mini-BOTs”, named after Italy’s short-term Treasury bills.

&gt; HOW WOULD IT WORK?
The Treasury would print billions of euros of non-interest-bearing, tradeable securities which could then be used by recipients to pay taxes and buy any services or goods provided by the state, including, for example, petrol at stations run by state-controlled oil company ENI.

&gt; According to Claudio Borghi, the economics chief of the far-right League, who is the main proponent of the scheme, the certificates would quickly become accepted more widely and used as a form of money to be “spent anywhere, to buy anything.”

&gt; Initially they would be used only domestically and would not be traded on international financial markets.

This is how you exit the Eurozone, not by announcing it a year ahead of time, or expressing your plans to do so before actually doing so.

In Portugal for decades, perversely we had such pro-tenant legislation that the rental market dried up. We had many frozen rents for decades of high inflation, people with a rental contract had their place for life. If they stopped paying rent, it could take many many years before they were evicted for example... 20 in cases I can think of. There are still people paying 50, 100 euros for places in prime locations in Lisbon. High inflation and frozen rents led to a market where nobody was going to buy to rent out, nobody built to rent out, it was buy only. In the 70s to 90s suburbia expanded a lot and many people were able to buy out their houses.

Also for a while banks gave out 100% financing and were Ok with overvaluing houses. rental laws changed since then, though current government is trying to appease populism by trying to put restrictions on landlords on future contracts (and in the era of airbnb it is dangerous..). But the banks got new post crisis restrictions, they can only loan 80% of their own evaluation - many people not able to save are taking personal loans for the rest, which is worrying indeed.

Your people clearly didn't forget history. But it seems that these two nations haven't only not forgotten their history with Russia, they've applied it to the current time. 

As much as I understand it all, it's unhealthy. Yes, we can justify it all, saying Russia hasn't changed, naming Ukraine, Georgia, but this isn't the full picture. I am not going to justify Russia's actions as they were clearly wrong, but in geopolitics, there is no black or white nor right or wrong. There are only national (and alliance) interests - NATO really wanted Crimea. And EU - Ukraine (NATO did too, imagine being so close to Russia with tank divisions, the only thing dividing you from Moscow are 'a few' kms of plain - an indefensible geographical and geological location, this would create an enormous geopolitical tension on the scale we've never seen) . But a country that has a turmoil on its own land cannot be accepted into either of alliances. Which is what Russia had to do (the uprising) in order to preserve its backdoor - a red line Putin talked about in his Munich speech in 2006 if I am not mistaken. Clearly the West wanted Russia to react, as they did, punishing it for its actions. But I don't think they expected a sophisticated non-violent takeover of Crimea.

Our debt was already high in 2008 and the spread between our titles was double than the current one and we had a technical governament which only barely managed to keeps us out the terrible hands of the troika.

 The only sensible difference from  ten years ago is that we used to love Europe and now we dislike to be kind. Why? Years of : austerity , increasing poverty, racist insults at various degrees of openness (from protestant morals bullshit to the wine and women crap) and the absolute sad show which has been the migrant crisis and still is.

&gt; you think Russia would work hard toward the goal to prep up poland to a point where it can join as equal to the club of powerful established countries? with equal voice and respect?

If you think the goal for Poland or any other such country was to join as an ""equal to the club of powerful established countries,"" you are not thinking critically. The end goal is for these societies to behave according to Western expectations. The entire fit that was thrown over the allocation of refugees is proof enough of that. And the lack of effective ability to centrally regulate this sort of thing is a beloved argument of federalists.

Also, do you expect me to believe that Serbia, a country of seven million voices, will be fairly represented as a constituent part of your giant federation, as opposed to some other giant federation? I find the idea of being ruled by local incompetents far less insulting than the suggestion that some dusty German bureaucrat understands what my country needs. That person thinks he knows what's best for our country, and his opinion is that we should behave as suits the Western European political class. 

Of course in this case, for political reasons, the EU is supporting these local incompetents, despite its touted lofty standards. The ends justify the means, am I right?

&gt; on the other hand i really dont care, because nobody flees to russia. or hungary. all the smart people go west anyway. i wonder why?

So you're essentially threatening us with ""join or die"" here, but joining will only kill us faster as the flight of the population is further facilitated, just like what's happened with Romania or Bulgaria or any other country that's joined the EU.

Joining any political bloc is a disaster for any small country. We would be cowed into subservience one way or another.

&gt;You have provided no evidence.

If I provided none, you neither supporting your point, prove me how France or Britain screwed it more in Libya than Italy? You have not a single example for now.

&gt;You are a Romanian and many Romanians have a chip on their shoulder  because Italians don’t like them because tons of Romanian criminals  migrated to Italy and contribute heavily to the crime rate,

Oh I see now fully your way of thinking. You are oversimplistic, xenophobic (that at least I knew it since the beginning), hypocrite and arrogant.

Tell me dear Italian friend, if Romanian criminals really migrated to Italy and supposedly contributed heavily to the crime rate, I think they didn't need any effort to make your crime rate so awful: Italians are basically worldwide known for their cancerous mafias, you have no lesson to give to us in terms of crime and shithole places plagued by mafia and crime organisation. If we're that good in crime as you're thinking, then you're our mentor. Fix your southern dysfunctioning regions that your government has no authority on, before blaming foreigners for your shitty scores in crime/corruption would you.

&gt;meanwhile Britain and France installed dictators right up until the 1980s

&amp;#x200B;

And you maintained and helped one of the worst dictator ever in this continent: Gaddafi. Why did you forget to mention that Italy was the only Western country to help Gaddafi in his beginning, financing his state and buying alone his oil in vast quantity in the 70s? Yeah convenience all over again. You seem to be quite insanely focused on France or Britain for no reason, I mean, everybody here knows they wrongdoings in Africa, that's no secret, but what strikes me here is your full autistic manner to close your eyes on Italian wrongdoings, particularly in Libya (since you talked about this country in particular) where it is known Italy was a great ally of the dictator, supported him, and is a direct cause of the Libyan revolution having letting Gaddafi to stay in power way too long, ultimately creating tensions and the current situation.

All your ex colonies were fucked up by France and UK? That's new to me, never heard of neocolonialist actions led by France or Britain in Ethiopia, Eritrea or even Somalia, or at least not as significant as Italy then. As for Libya, I know what you're talking about, after Italy surrendered in WW2, Libya was divided into 2 parts administrated by the British and French, for how many years? 7 years at best. And they granted independence to Libya in 51. At the meantime, Italian colonists still lived there for more than 20 years after the independence day.

1975,"&gt; Selling is only allowed after consent of other states. So much of the worlds' gold is held by states, that a sell-off could tank the value.

That is not the main concern. The main issue is that today when you buy gold, you dont actually get gold, but a certificate.

Most gold reserves are stored in NY (This happend after WWII, as US seemed to be the safest place, trading was done there, and also because US promised to help finance the rebuild and was asking for something in return). In order to keep reserves intact people actually trade gold certificates which represent the gold locked in the vaults. The issue is that there are now probably more certificates than there is actual gold. So some of those certificates aren't actually backed by anything.

It is believed that this is the main reason why Germany decided to step-by-step bring all the gold home by 2020 (if i remember the year correctly), as the last one who does will probably end empty handed.",,/r/europe/comments/9qzite/gold_reserves_of_european_countries_in_tonnes/e8d0uld/,KrainerWurst,1540392242

Because you are not supposed to fight for freedom in a weird way in civilized countries, only Russia is the right place for such activities, how could he not understand that.

Now he might regret that he is not in Russian jail instead, cause I bet he will not be awarded dignity prize for bein in French prison.

2190,"&gt; This is not true. Russia apparently still sent the amount for WE through the pipeline even when they cut off Ukraine.

Depends when, for example in 2009 because of Russia/Ukraine gas dispute, many European countries had large shortages.

&gt; But why do you even care whether Russia cuts off Ukraine or Poland? You guys are, or at least want to be independent from Russian gas anyways, so why is this an issue? If you don't buy from Russia, why would you be worried about getting cut off?

Firstly, diversifying takes time. Secondly, Poland isnt the only CEE country affected by this. Imagine that, caring if our neighbors and allies will be under threat of Russia.

&gt; Shows that indeed it's just about transfer fees, delivering some form of payback to Germany, or simply building up potential to blackmail Germany in the future.

Shows you have no clue what you are talking about or you are just being willfully ignorant. Fees? A couple million $ per year for Poland from transit fees is nothing to our budget. Payback? Sure and NS2 is really Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact ver. 2.0 (this is the level of your ""arguments""). Poland blackmailing Germany?

2299,"&gt; I see . So I'm supposed to take your word for that word salad (still no links to back up anything) , but my 2015 OECD report is out dated . Got it . :)  
  
I provided you with keywords you didn't ask for, for answer you don't actually seek (and never will since you work backward to fit your conclusion), but I didn't try to pass hypothesis for facts.  
I might be lazy, although still less than you, but unlike you, I'm not dishonest.  
  
Sure your link is outdated, but the point is mostly your conclusions are bullshit and no link in existence supports them, regardless of the year it's from.  
  
&gt;None of which you linked . I'm beginning to see a pattern here  
  
I'm not the one making ridiculous claims here, I don't have to provide anything since I'm not trying to prove anything, other than the fact you are wrong, which doesn't really requires a link.  
  
&gt;Are you saying that a lack of a belief system is not a belief system ?  
  
No I'm arguing the lack of a religion is not a lack of a belief system, not only because an atheist belief system doesn't necessarily care to define itself against religion. (People were murdered in the name of the Soviet Union, not in the name of ""there is no god"".)  
By design but also because religious power historically had actually more to do with politics than religion.
  
&gt;Sorry to burst your bubble, but this has actually been a debated topic for centuries (and I'm not expecting a resolution here) , with the ""Torcaso v. Watkins"" , United States Supreme Court case siding with the notion that secular humanism is a religion. This assertion is based on a court case where organized groups of self-identified humanists, or ethicists, meeting on a regular basis to share and celebrate their beliefs, have been granted religious-based tax exemptions. Now how do you get granted a religion based tax exempt status ? You apply for it . Meaning that said Atheists have applied for tax exemptions based on the notion that their Atheism was equal to the legal status of religion based tax exemption .  
  
From what I gather, this is mostly a matter of interpreting the law, and in that case to grant secular movements the same tax exemptions, and protection than church and its members, which has very little relevance for anyone who isn't an american lawyer and about zero use for any philosophical purpose.
  

&gt;Agnosticism is not a religion . Atheism can be perceived as such , especially the vigor with which Soviet Communists hated religion .  
  
Then again, and although the Soviet regime fought religion from an ideological standpoint, all of this was done in order to pry power out of the church and drive the masses away from religious power, but very little people dies because of their religion under the Soviet regime.  
  
The deaths caused by Stalin's purges, agricultural policies and forced relocations in the 1020s – 1930s, are hard to calculate, but may be 10 million people intentionally. If you count all deaths as a consequence (intentional and unintentional) of every Soviet policy from 1917 to 1953, the total could be as high as 81 million people. But very few of those deaths had anything to do with religion: most were from starvation due to agricultural policies and forced relocation for political reasons.  
  
By comparison, the deaths throughout recorded human history suffered as a result of religious beliefs or religious persecution are equally impressive. The Thirty Years' War (1618 - 1648) alone caused as many as 11 million+ deaths, and the French Wars of Religion (Catholic vs. Huguenot, 1562 - 1598) caused up to 4 million deaths. Human sacrifice to the ""gods"" in the Aztec empire claimed from 300,000 to 1.5 million lives. The deaths during the various Crusades are estimated to be from 1 to 1.7 million. Add to that the millions killed in Europe (especially Germany) as ""witches"" in the middle ages, and the victims of the various Inquisitions…  
  
The most important distinction is that religious wars cause deaths explicitly BECAUSE of religion whereas Soviet (and Chinese, and Cambodian ) mass killings were never motivated by religious belief OR lack thereof.  
  
Trying to suppress religion and its leaders was a matter of cultural war for regimes, most germans and soviets remained privately religious under their leaders, but nobody was allowed to challenge the party, especially not in the name of god.  
  
And be that as it may, religion keeps killing to this day, just not in countries you care about, and even by inflating numbers as much as you want, the death toll for religious leaders dwarfs anything any modern atheist regime could ever do.",,/r/europe/comments/9qbcux/for_the_first_time_nonreligious_people_in_the/e8ckoqi/,Y_Sam,1540371380

If 2015 parliamentary elections had never happened, PiS could have considered these results a modest success. But 2015 elections happened and one cannot treat 2014 and 2018 local elections in isolation. Therefore, despite populist policies, a lot of money poured into the elections, heavy propaganda machine, they have not won more is a huge blow to them and a message that they are not unstoppable.

Face the facts, the colonies Italy left behind were the closest to fully functioning countries right from the 50s in all of Africa and it wasn't until the French and British took them over that they turned into the total fucking mess the rest of Africa is.

We neither converted them nor forced our language upon them.

Libya was the most developed country in Africa, way more than even white South Africa, it was prosperous and had a fully functioning medical system and ambitious infrastructure, whereas the rest of Africa was spending billions on fancy cars and other nonesense thanks to Anglo-French kelptocracy.

And today Italians are expected to clean up the mess of the British and the French? Fuck that. and Fuck the french for arming fucking terrorirsts to overthrow Ghadaffi.

&gt; 
&gt; 

Really, it's not.  What happens when the people decide they don't want socialism?  

Obviously this is an invalid result.  And when the people choose this, as they inevitably must at some point, the government must step in to correct their error.  Since it's an error and socialism is the only solution.  

See how authoritarianism is inherent to socialism?  If the people choose another solution, it is wrong and the government must crush them.  This isn't a new observation.

&gt;In fact, **the Polish Cossacks** considered themselves PRECISELY as an intrinsic part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, as its citizens and associated themselves with it and that's why they wanted to be treated equally as other members of the same nation.

You turned cossacks into polish. I'm just dreaming right now! The rest of your paragraph is pure history revisionism. They saw themsepves as human beings first and wanted to be treated equally. How surprising! Yet it doesn't mean they considered themselves as pole and wanted to be part of the Commpnwealth?

Sweden could beat Poland because it was so fragmented, it could beat saxony because it was weak, it could beat Denmark because of allied Dutch and English fleets. It couldn’t beat Russia because of numbers. 

Sweden armed 4, for Sweden large field armies of about 30-40k, after that it was drained in manpower.  The invasion of Russia 1707 was for Sweden the largest army it has ever put on its feet until 20th century, an army of 45.000 men. For Russia that was nothing, Sweden captured an army that large in Narva, beat one in holowcyn and Russia just replenished the losses in the nearby territories. 

In 17th century warfare it was about how many men you could manoeuvre effectively, in 18th century it was about how many you could arm. Which is one of the reasons for the Swedish decline, low population numbers. All the great powers had large populations, France, Russia, uk, Holy Roman Empire. The exception is the Dutch, but they weren’t an warfare empire as much as a naval and commerce empire. If they, like the uk needed soldiers they bought an army.

The thing with same-sex marriage it that Paul mentions it as a sign of moral corruption in Romans 1, so it features in both the OT and the NT.

2563,"&gt;The Burdenko Commission was hardly independent in this matter, since the same Politburo gave their authority that was accused of ordering and approving the crime.

The Burdenko Commision was oversaw by an independent reporter, daughter of US ambassdor, Kathleen Harriman and she believed that Germans did it.

[https://youtu.be/Jnbnd5gwsDk?t=14m4s](https://youtu.be/Jnbnd5gwsDk?t=14m4s)

You can see her listening to a witness who is describing how she saw a partial execution of Poles.

And the finding of this commision are independent of anything.

&gt;That is totally inconsistent with the Nazi behaviour. They covered up all their crimes as good as they could, and tried to destroy every piece of evidence regarding them. In the case of Katyn they not only didn't do that but they invited the Red Cross and Allied POWs to investigate the crime scene.

This is perfectly consistent with subversive Goebbels propaganda. They didn't try to cover up the Katyn crime - they tried to cover up their involvement with it and use it to cause rift withing the Allies.

Red Cross was smart enough to bother with this sh`t, btw. Seems liek humanity mentally degraded since then.

&gt;That would be a very stupid move for small political gains. The Katyn massacre is but a small one in the list of the crimes committed by the Soviet Communist Party, and it is a very dubious way to garner internal support by proving that the Soviet State gave orders to execute foreigners. *(As your case doubtlessly shows it too.)

That would not be a stupid move if they properly forged the documents. Instead they are full of logical fallacies, inconsistencies and outright blatant formatting mistakes

2602,"&gt; I did not say it is a ""gift"" or something you ""deserve"", I said it is something of value and accepting means accepting responsibility. If you get it by birth then as you become an adult you accept the resoncibilities or you should renounce it.

First off: as said a lot of countries do not allow people to renounce citizenship or make them go through ridiculous hoops to do so.

Second off: We're talking about criminals who already break the law: there is no responsibility under citizenship to ""not break the law""; that's absurd.

&gt; As for jurisdiction, if he entered my country and committed a crime serious enough to be jailed for life then I do not care what his home country thinks. If they try to use it against us then I would use that against them.

Well that's in general not done; tourists without citizenship who commit crimes are typically delivered to their home country and tried there; this is vital for diplomatic relationships on both ends. Countries rarely try to punish the citizens of other countries even if the crime is committed on their soil; it's just bad for diplomatic relations to do so. You can say ""use it against them"" all you want but it weakens your country's standing in the international arena to dos o.

I eat pretty much only meat. I have type 1 diabetes, so it helps me to maintain stable blood glucose levels. 

It's interesting how diet can become such a tribal thing. Vegans hate meat eaters and meat eaters hate vegans, i'm generalising obviously. But it's not uncommon to find reddit threads where a full blown war has broken out over what people prefer to eat. It's weird. 

Personally, I think that what diet works for people is highly individual. It's the only conclusion i can come to after having heard contles anecdotes and read many studies contradicting each other. 

The only thing that I dare to say for sure is that if you have diabetes, a vegan/vegetarian diet might not be for you, or at least avoid foods containing really fast carbs like pasta or white bread.

Did I say anything along those lines? No.
All I said was that I did not take it into account for my argument *because it doesn't matter*. 

Again, you completely fail to address my actual argument.


&gt;Its not like deportation of Germans was purely Czech decision... its not like it was not decided beforehand...

The discussion is not about whether or not the Czech people made some decisions or not, I never made any claims whatsoever about this. I'm questioning your statement about the grounds for deportation, and this is entirely irrelevant to that. 


It's about whether or not they were deported because they were traitors. And that isn't what happened.

And to that end *it does not matter who made the decision or whether it was decided beforehand (whatever that means).* All that matters is whether or not there was a fair trial according to the principles of the rule of law. And there wasn't.

Again, you completely ignore my actual point. **Deporting people based on their ethnicity (with exemptions), based on the fact that almost all of them were traitors is not the same as deporting traitors. It just isn't. Even if 99.999999% of them were traitors, it's not the same.**

The principle of the rule of law states 'innocent until proven guilty'. And until everyone that was deported has been tried based on that principle and been proven guilty, they have not been deported for treason. They have been deported for 'likely treason' or something similar. But imo, that difference is important.

2671,"&gt; There is no tech in the world that can autonomously dogfight an Airplane, or do complex maneuvers

Arhm, the Eurofighter already does that. For example if a missile if going after an EF2000 the computer calculates the perfect route to evade the missile and projects the path into the pilots HUD. All the pilot has to do is flying the pre-calculated manoeuvres as the computer tells him. There really is nothing complex in such things. Complex maneuvers? Its not the pilot but the fly by wire system which is keeping the plane in the air anyway. Because all modern jets are aerodynamic unstable and a human would crash them seconds after the take-off. Its the FBW system translating the nonsensical commands of the pilot into the things which actually have to happen.

The problem with autonomous system is the decision making. Can a system judge if a group of people on the ground is friendly or the enemy? Is it responsible to let a computer make the kill decision? And if yes, how can a computer get the nessesary informations to ""understand"" a situation which it is observing. In a unespected situation there are all sorts of things involved when it comes to the questions ""Drop the bomb? Yes or no? You have 7sec.!"" And those things include the pilots ethics, his sense for a certain situation and subconscious paramenters we cant even specify for a given autonomous system.

2744,"Europe has a recurring theme of immigrant families from Islamic nations like Morocco (1st, 2nd gen mostly) committing acts of terrorism in Europe. Do you think Morocco should have a moral issue with that, especially when those immigrants are still citizens of their country? 

I mention this because it is likely a motivator behind his revoked citizenship. Morocco as a nation had nothing to do with his circumstances, but Belgians likely attribute his religious zealotry and intolerance in part to Moroccan culture because of it's strong ties to Islam and the tendency of Moroccan immigrants to live in their own micro-communities that strongly mimic Moroccan society instead of a ""traditional"" Belgian's.

Ultimately I would agree that there is a moral issue with dumping him to the Moroccans since they are technically removed from the situation. But it also is far safer for Europeans if he is no longer on the continent. Deporting him to Morocco largely confines where he can go (if/when he is released), and sends a message that those who commit terror in Europe will not enjoy the comforts of European prisons. It's not morally airtight, but few things are in the real world and ultimately it's what Belgium thinks will protect its citizens in a time where such acts of terrorism are occurring frequently.

One of the reasons Italy does not have as many tall churches as Northern Europe is that the Italian Gothic style was the least influenced by French Gothic architecture (which was the benchmark for many of its neighbouring countries) and still retained a certain preference for large spaces. 

What many architects wanted to achieve in Italy are spaces where the aisles and the main naive can be seen altogether. Compare that with the French, English, German Gothic, where the ogive  arches and the supporting columns are so narrow that you can barely see the from one aisles to another.

Also, antiquity never really went away completely in Italy even during the middle ages, so the Italian architects wanted to imitate classical architecture. This meant that horizontal lines and vertical ones were not massively skewed toward the latter as in Northern Europe.


Finally, because Italy urbanised earlier than Northern Europe, there were already quite a few large cathedrals (e.g. Modena, Verona, Venice, Parma, Genoa, Pisa, Lucca, etc) built in the Romanesque style, a style that did not emphasise vertical lines and were the technical possibilities were not as advanced as in the gothic era.

The reason BENELUX has so many tall churches is because the low countries was, together with Northern and Central Italy, the most urbanised, richest and decentralised area of Europe (i.e. flemish cities had more power than French, German or English cities, where the feudal authorities retained most of the power). Textile industry in particular generated a lot of cash that partly went to finance the construction of big churches and competition between the various flemish cities.

&gt; Yes, cause thats all this budget does.

If you’re not willing to discuss in good faith as your tone indicates, there’s no point in continuing 

The fact that it's even a part of the budget is absolutely unacceptable. You don't have a cent to spare and your hill to die on is letting people *stop contributing to the economy earlier and go on government support earlier*.

You are free to tell me how the budget will actually save your country but the great thing about your government is that they are so ridiculous that the sheer uncertainty of them being in charge will probably cancel out any benefits their good policies should have.

You turn "" Cossacks were usually organized by Ruthenian boyars or princes of the nobility, especially various Lithuanian starostas. Merchants, peasants and runaways from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth"" into ""cossacks were mostly peasants and thieves"" so yes you are obviously making shit up

Absolutely, because everybody knows that countries produce everything themselves and do not need to use other currencies at all. And of course if somebody is thinking how to deal with you, they do not think about how do you compare with them nominaly. 

&amp;#x200B;

PPP is usefull when you want to have better look at growth of countries without getting wild fluctuation due to exchange rate fluctuations.

2828,"That's a matter of: bond interest rate - inflation.  
If the bonds give 5% of interests, and the inflation is of 3%, you effectively gain 2% from that bond (that works for nationals buying their own debt, as it happened, no idea how that changes for extra-nationals with a different currency buying). Keeping that difference in the positive is the work of who manages the bond emission market for that nation.  
  
The inflation being high as a result of devaluation is a disincentive to keep money into a deposit, and an incentive to invest in goods with resell value. That's one of the reasons why the housing sector in Italy has been historically big, people would buy houses as physical deposit, the housing prices would follow the inflation, which means being able to get back the money spent adjusted to inflation at a later time by reselling the bought house.

&gt; The Polish Press and Armenian Genocide from 1895 to 1920

&gt; The Armenian Question was a very popular topic in the European press in the 19th and 20th centuries. Many articles were published in the English, Italian, French, Russian and German newspapers and magazines. Interestingly enough, interest in the issue extended beyond the countries directly involved in affairs of the Ottoman Empire. Information regarding the Armenian Question was also published in the Polish press, a press that belonged to a nation without its own territory. Poland had not existed on a political map of Europe since 1795. Polish lands were a part of the German, Austrian and Russian Empires, and Poles were citizens of those countries. Polish writers, poets, politicians and noblemen were forced to emigrate, the Polish language was abolished in official political life, and the Polish press was censored.1 Even though facing many difficulties since the Congress of Berlin (1878), the events relating to the situation of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire were widely known to the Polish public.

I did not realize the German government held Greek debt prior to the crisis, do you have any source for this?

&gt; And contrary to what the article says, this 2,9 billion hasn't been integrated into the German budget but is still ""on hold""; 

-----

&gt; The answer provided by the German ministry of finance shows that between 2010 and 2017  benefits generated by interest rate amounted to a total of €2.9 billion. These benefits were first transferred to the Bundesbank and then into the federal budget.

I take it this means something different in German. 

&gt; And even if they don't; this money is only a profit if Greece pays back its debt - which it probably won't.

They don't have to pay it back, they'll simply have to service it on the market eventually.

&gt; Also, one has to consider the interest Germany could have gained with the money it lent to Greece if it would have done something else with it. This would have certainly amounted to much more than 2,9 billion.

Opportunity costs is not the same as real costs.

Lol. No. In fact the nobles were among the first to look to be like the occupying powers.

Polish culture often remained stronger in the lower classes where it had *less* and not more exposure to Prussian or Russian efforts to eradicate it. Also the efforts were only started after the 1860s with the Kulturkampf and with Russification efforts. And despite the effort they failed.

If there is a ""carrier of our cultures"" then at least in Poland it was the Roman Catholic Church. This is also where the modern idea of Poland being Catholic or vanishing off the map comes from.

2938,"Yes, I know the argument, and we have all seen the problems with excessive austerity throughout the Eurozone crisis. The issue with Italy is that with so much fiscal pressure, its spending needs to be allocated with extreme efficiency if it's going to simultaneously boost growth and keep the deficit under control. 

You point out that Italy basically can't spend to boost growth because its debt repayments force it to run a constant large primary surplus. That's a huge problem, but there's nothing that can be done about that situation. Italy in the late 20th century decided to spend the future's money and now, unfortunately, its current generations are paying for what Italians enjoyed in the previous decades. There's no way for the current generations to get out of having that burden, because their parents chose to force it on them. As such, Italy *has* to remain in a state of perpetual austerity, because it has no way not to be. If it decides to put paying off for future generations again, things will just progressively get worse and worse for every new generation of Italians. That's not OK - Italy is already feeling massive brain drain because young Italians realise that their careers will do nothing but pay for the pensions of a generation that chose to retire at 50.

What Italy needs to be looking at is ways to boost growth that aren't simply ""let's let people leave the workforce earlier!"" (???). There are a million things they could do if they were willing to push them through - just look at France's education and training reforms and the massive simplification of labour and general business laws. Unfortunately, Italians have never been interested in strong government, so reformers aren't viable politically, and the guys promising to give everyone free money (that previous governments just didn't want to give, because they were just stupid, right?) are much more appealing.

It's unfortunate, especially for us Slovaks, but I believe Russia will not want to lose Slovakia's government's friendliness. But I can see that happening nonetheless. Gas transit is giving us quite the revenue, so it'd be a huge blow to our budget if they stopped. They have no intention in doing so, but if Ukraine starts throwing a tantrum about how they're not going to pay for the gas, and with Turkish Stream and Nord Stream 2 being built by then, we'll have a problem. And I am pretty sure people will know who's the culprit. Given Ukraine is continuing in taking loans from the IMF, I am not sure if they'll be able to be paying Gazprom. The history of Ukraine's payments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia–Ukraine_gas_disputes) for gas tell us a good deal about how bad things go, and we Slovaks have and will probably feel it again. I read a Slovak article about how Groisman said Ukraine will have to pay a significant (1/3?) part of their budget to pay off debt next year. If that's the case then God help us and our gas supplies: http://www.tellerreport.com/news/--groisman--ukraine-in-2019-will-have-to-give-a-third-of-the-budget-to-pay-off-the-national-debt-.B1NBt9l57.html

2960,"You failed to understand what I tried to explain in my comment.

Most nationalist ideology comes from the attempt of the middle-class politicians to gather enough support from the lower classes to get into power. Upper classes were traditional elites and they used feudal traditions, monarchy and religion as instruments of the legitimization of their power.  Middle classes were up-and-coming elites and they had nothing so they invented this new phenomenon where people were becoming more alike linguistically and culturally and called it a ""nation"".

In Poland the nobles were twice as numerous as the nobles in places like say France and they had greater degree of autonomy and power. In cities close to 50% were typically Jews. The country was heavily agricultural.  So not only the elites were stronger, the cities were more Jewish than Polish but also more people lived in the countryside and when there were cities often they would lie within nobility's lands so no legal protection like cities on king's lands.

So the middle class in Poland was very limited - mostly stemming from the cities in the crownlands. It never managed to become so strong as to be able to consider whether they could rule the country.

If that happened it would have to have happened about a century earlier at the latest. But it only began with the enlightenment movement in mid 18th century - mere decades before partition and *after* Poland became the de-facto protectorate of Russia.  The first attempt to use nationalism came after the first partition but it was too late.

So nationalism only emerged later when the elites of the former country tried to re-gain power.  Since most of them were nobles then the type of nationalism had very strong heritage of nobility's culture and with that certain ideas, way of looking at the world  that is different from how city-based middle-class looked at the world. 

And this is why our nationalism is more stupid than nationalism in other countries in Europe.",,/r/europe/comments/9qlfi9/what_do_you_know_about_the_polishlithuanian/e8b9tm2/,vzenov,1540320426

2979,"Jews were not the middle class. They were part of the middle class. Plenty of Jews would fall into the upper lower class.

The Jews did nothing out of the goodness of their hearts. They counted every grosh and zloty and ruble.

In 18th century plenty of them turned hostile to the idea of being part of Polish society since they developed their own nationalism that was at odds with Polish nationalism.  Many of those Jews were Jews from Russia who were forcibly re-settled into the Pale. They had very antagonistic attitude to Poland and often were supportive of Russian Empire despite being forced to emigrate.  Jewish Zionists would stir up conflict with Poles to divide the population and would find unlikely allies in that among Polish nationalists on the right.

This is the root of ""Polish antisemitism"" which is based in political adversity to Jewish ethno-cultural chauvinism within Poland. Poles did not see the rights given to Jews as a foundation for their political autonomy or even independence. They saw Russian Jews as a direct threat and Russian Jews did not see Poland as a host nation but as a place where they could carve a country of their own within the Empire.

The share of Jews that were overtly hostile to Poland was equal to the share of Poles who were overtly hostile to Jews. The share of Jews who were friendly to Poland was equal to the share of Poles who were friendly to Jews. Most people were minding their own business.

Your comment of ""and how they were thanked"" is right from the Zionist playbook.  Considering how Russia treated them and how later Germany treated them and how they themselves treated Palestinians I'd say they were thanked the right way.

3009,"achberlin.txt

&gt; Ach Berlin. Was ist Berlin? Berlin ist die Stadt für die man sich als Deutscher auf internationaler Bühne schämen muss. Wenn man Berlin mit anderen europäischen Hauptstädten wie London, Paris, Madrid und Amsterdam vergleicht, treibt es jedem anständigen Menschen die Schamesröte ins Gesicht. Selbst kleine Länder wie Österreich, Belgien oder die Schweiz haben mit Wien, Brüssel und Zürich international vorzeigbare Städte mit hoher Lebensqualität. Deutschland ist gestraft mit Berlin, der Hauptstadt der Versager. Berlin beheimatet mit Abstand am meisten Arschlöcher in der gesamten Republik. Deutsche Bahn, Bundestag, Air Berlin und der Axel Springer Verlag sind nur einige Beispiele für den unfähigen Abschaum der hier beherbergt wird.
&gt; 
&gt; Glorreiche Zeit sind schon längst vorbei, diese Stadt liegt am Boden. Der Berliner an sich ist durch und durch ein fauler Lump. Charaktereigenschaften die in jedem zivilisierten Kulturkreis als pure Faulheit, Unfreundlichkeit, Unfähigkeit, dissoziale Persönlichkeitsstörung und Dummheit gelten, erklärt der Berliner kurzerhand zur Berliner Wesensart. Ein weiteres zentrales Merkmal ist der alles beherrschende Minderwertigkeitskomplex. Deswegen projiziert der Berliner auf jeden der in irgendeiner Weise besser ist als er, massive Hassgefühle. Besonders die ihm in allen Belangen haushoch überlegenen Süddeutschen sind ihm ein Dorn im Auge. Er neidet ihnen den Erfolg und München steht ganz oben auf seiner Hassliste. Diese Stadt ist alles und hat alles was der Berliner gerne wäre und hätte. Das München dem Berliner sein Lotterleben finanziert, interessiert den Berliner nicht, er glaubt sogar insgeheim er hätte es verdient. Anstatt sich aus seiner aus Neid und Missgunst entstehenden Lethargie zu befreien und seine Stadt umzukrempeln, ergeht er sich in asozialen Schmarotzertum und hält noch große Stücke auf seine vermeintliche Weltstadt.
&gt; 
&gt; Kulturell ist Berliner eher schwach veranlagt, große Werke liegen lang zurück. Auch gilt hier bereits das Aussprechen des Buchstaben »g« als »j« als große Kulturleistung. Fortgeschrittene beherrschen sogar das Anhängen eines »wa?« an den Ende eines jeden Satzes. Das Leistungsniveau in der Küche bewegt sich auf überschaubarem Niveau. Eine Wurst aus gemahlenem Seperatorenfleisch mit Ketchup und Currygewürz wird hier als Currywurst und als kulinarischer Geniestreich verkauft. Jeder vernünftig denkende Mensch hält eine Wurst mit Ketchup wohl kaum für den heiligen Gral der Küchenkunst und wahrscheinlich noch nicht einmal für ein Rezept. Großzügig lässt der Rest der Republik den Berliner in diesem Glauben um seine Minderwertigkeitskomplexe nicht überhand nehmen zu lassen.
&gt; 
&gt; Wirtschaftlich ist Berlin ein einziges Desaster, selbst die späte DDR stand solider da. Ansonsten fußt die Berliner Wirtschaft auf alternativen Blogs, irgendwas mit Medien und Genderstudies wenn man den Universitäten glauben darf. Ungeachtet des wirtschaftlichen Bankrottes leistet sich der Berliner trotzdem Prestigeprojekte wie das Stadtschloss und einen Flughafen der mangels Funktionstüchtigkeit als Kunstprojekt gelten soll. Ebenso beherbergt diese Stadt sämtliche Zentralen der Volksparteien, die aus Marketinggründen auf das »Verräter« im Namen verzichten. Bürgermeister dieser Stadt war lange der lustige Wowibär der mit seiner Prestige&amp;Prosecco Politik alles in den Abgrund riss, was noch halbwegs präsentabel war.
&gt; 
&gt; Kurzum: Berlin ist der Fliesentisch Deutschlands. Es ist das für Deutschland, was Griechenland für die Europäische Union ist und hätte Berlin eine offene Kloake, wäre es das Rumänien Deutschlands. Berlin ist ein Schandfleck, der Pickel am Arsche Deutschlands. Berlin ist der Typ der ohne Einladung auf deine Party kommt, noch nicht mal Alkohol mitbringt und auch nicht versteht dass er nicht erwünscht ist wenn man ihm ein paar Zähne aus dem Gesicht klopft und die Treppe runterwirft. Berlin ist das Detroit Deutschlands und gehört für 200 Złoty an Polen verkauft.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/9qkizj/german_states_by_human_development_index_in_2017/e8azzyg/,Isuckatnicknames,1540312653

3014,"The Maastrict treaty means that any member of the EU should have a debt-to-GDP ratio below 60%. If you are not below this, you should at the very least make serious efforts to get there. 

Your own country - Portugal - is certainly reducing its debt load very systematically, though from a high base. The core complaint is that the previous government had begun a debt consolidation and deleveraging path but since M5S-Lega came to power, they ripped all of this up in favor of unsustainable populist measures like lowering pension age, massive tax cuts etc.

Now, the defenders of Italy's government will point out that Italy's primary surplus is on par with Germany's, so Italy really isn't ""irresponsible"" according to these people. But this misses the fact that Italy's debt load is twice that of Germany and their growth rate is around half.

Italy's main problem is fundamentally productivity growth - or lack thereof. That has resulted in a very weak economy which is barely growing. So even a low deficit will not do much to reduce debt since growth is anemic. The current Italian government maintains that more deficits will ""pay for themselves"" with higher growth. But this can only be true if it is invested in productive stuff (like infrastructural investments etc) and not social gibs.

USA feeds itself on internal debt, educational infrastructure is crumbling and the political discourse is laughable from both sides.

France and Germany have a crumbling health infrastructure just as ours ( just that theirs falls from a higher level ) and EU beaurocrats think that not letting the population shrink to manageable levels by an inflatepd economy that cannot keep pace is the better idea.

 You keep identifying Poland and Hungary with Russia as if these countries would ever align themselves with Russia again. You are like the liberal American that thinks Russia is orchestrating every political event in the West. Have you ever thought that maybe there is an independent, national thought and action taking place, corrupted by local politicians?

First off it's not even a strawman argument, I never said that Poland is necessarily better, just that together we might actually improve something. They aren't rich and never have I called them rich, you completely ignore the point I am making which calls for improvement via collective effort, not mooching off some countries, but glad to see that the idea of mooching is embedded in our conscience.

Since our independence in 1989 we have not become one step closer to France or Germany: the purchasing power of the poorest is laughable, prices for food rose to levels where some basic food is cheaper in Germany.

The Romanian wants his country to be like the US or Germany ir France without realising that his country can never be like those, and even if he tries, he is driving towards a crumbling city with no real opportunities. We mooch ( and we are really bad at it ) off of the EU via funds while even Poland and Hungary have been a lot better at using them. Even more, the Romanian will accuse Russia of creating instability.

1st, with regards to why I chose 1990 as the starting point for this MapChart, nothing special, it's the year I was born in;     
2nd, in 1990, the Pope John Paul II visited what was then Czechoslovakia, so to make things less burdensome, added a point to each country (mainly because the Pope went to both Prague and Bratislava during that visit, that is the present-day capitals of these two countries), and, finally,     
3rd, Italy, what's I supposed to do with you?! heck, it's a category of its own.    
Sorry for any mistake, error in this map.

Germany was in a very comparable position to Greece, we weren't called ""The sick man of the Euro"" for nothing. So changes were made that did hurt many people, reduction of unemployment benefits, creation of an entire economy based on low-income jobs, making the job market more fluid (= making it easier to fire people). All that was started by the Schröder government.

But now more than a decade later i say it was worth it. The SPD might never recover from the lost trust of the electorate in that the workers party massively reduced workers right, but still it was worth it i think.

So especially from the side of Germany, it's very reasonable to think that what was good for Germany would also be good for Greece. The difference remained the time that was required to let those changes work just wasn't there anymore.

But then again, what could have worked given the little time that was available?

What i would have liked to see would have been if Germany would have financially supplemented the Greek unemployment benefits system to offer the same as it does locally, so that even people who are long term unemployed would still received social security money (as i think that in Greece even social security is time limited, might be wrong though), that could have prevented people from going into early retirement and meant money injected into the local economy.

Just because winged hussars were parading in 18thC, that doesn't mean they weren't using the same equipment earlier. Just look for some modern example - like queen's guard.

Again, I'm pro weed though, because alcohol has greater negative effects on vulnerable people and if that flies than this has to too.

My problem is with the line of thinking that ""if there is no victim there is no crime"". Sometimes it's the self that is the victim and the abuser is not aware of it, so this line of thinking leads to victim blaming.

3438,"&gt;You understand that the US has had the North-South split, since its creation, yes?

Yeah, it was generally a conflict about state sovereignity. Care to remind us all how peacefully and justly that conflict ended? It didn't. It ended with the North using the excuse of slavery to step on the throat of the South, massively expanding Federal power at the expense of the power of the sovereign states (and to a certain extent in violation of the constitution). And before I get this accusation thrown at me, I'm not a fan of slavery at all. I just believe the southern states indeed had sovereignity, including the sovereignity to split off from the union if they so desired and form their own, looser union.

&gt;In the early 1840s [Lajos Kossuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lajos_Kossuth) pleaded in the newspaper [*Pesti Hirlap*](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pesti_Hirlap&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1)  for rapid Magyarization: ""Let us hurry, let us hurry to Magyarize the  Croats, the Romanians, and the Saxons, for otherwise we shall perish"". In 1842 he argued that Hungarian had to be the exclusive language in public life. He also stated that *in  one country it is impossible to speak in a hundred different languages.  There must be one language and in Hungary this must be Hungarian*.  The slogan of the Magyarization campaign was *One country – one language – one nation*

You are right. The minorities forced the hungarians to magyarize them. /s

The one that should go to school is you, cause that guy is spot on. And I had 10 out of 10 in history in school. Why don't you tell me to go back to school too? Learn a thing or 2 about magyarization then talk.

&gt;The Hungarian Nationalities Law (1868) guaranteed that all citizens of the [Kingdom of Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary) (then part of the [Austro-Hungarian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Empire)), whatever their nationality, constituted politically ""*a single nation, the indivisible, unitary Hungarian nation*"",  and there could be no differentiation between them except in respect of  the official usage of the current languages and then only insofar as  necessitated by practical considerations. In spite of the law, the use of minority languages was banished almost entirely from administration and even justice. Defiance of, or appeals to, the Nationalities Law met with derision or abuse. The [Hungarian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language) was overrepresented in the primary schools and almost all secondary education was in Hungarian.  
&gt;  
&gt;By the end of the 19th century, the state apparatus was entirely  Hungarian in language, as were business and social life above the lowest  levels. The Magyarization of the towns had proceeded at an astounding rate. Nearly all middle-class [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) and [Germans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans) and many middle-class [Slovaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovaks) and [Ruthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruthenes) had been Magyarized.  The percentage of the population with Hungarian as its mother tongue  grew from 46.6% in 1880 to 54.5% in 1910. The 1910 census (and the  earlier censuses) did not register ethnicity, but mother tongue (and  religion) instead, based on which it is sometimes subject to [criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Trianon#Criticism_of_the_1910_census).  
&gt;  
&gt;Between 1850 and 1910 the ethnic Hungarian population increased by  106.7%, while the increase of other ethnic groups was far slower:  Serbians and Croatians 38.2%, Romanians 31.4% and Slovaks 10.7%.The Magyarization of Budapest was rapid  and it implied not only the assimilation of the old inhabitants, but  also the Magyarization of the immigrants. In the capital of Hungary, in  1850 56% of the residents were Germans and only 33% Hungarians, and in  1910 almost 90% declared themselves Magyars.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to census data, the Hungarian population of Transylvania  increased from 24.9% in 1869 to 31.6% in 1910. In the same time, the  percentage of Romanian population decreased from 59.0% to 53.8% and the  percentage of German population decreased from 11.9% to 10.7%. Changes  were more significant in cities with predominantly German and Romanian  population. For example, the percentage of Hungarian population  increased in [Braşov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%C5%9Fov)  from 13.4% in 1850 to 43.43% in 1910, meanwhile the Romanian population  decreased from 40% to 28.71% and the German population from 40.8% to  26.41%.  
&gt;  
&gt;The notion of a Hungarian political nation increasingly became one of a  Magyar nation. ""\[A\]ny political or social movement which challenged the  hegemonic position of the Magyar ruling classes was liable to be  repressed or charged with 'treason'..., 'libel' or 'incitement of  national hatred'. This was to be the fate of various [Slovak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovaks), [South Slav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Slavs) \[e.g. [Serb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs)\], [Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanians) and [Ruthene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruthenes) cultural societies and nationalist parties from 1876 onward.  
&gt;  
&gt;Beginning with the 1879 Primary Education Act and the 1883 Secondary  Education Act, the Hungarian state made more efforts to reduce the use  of non-Magyar languages, in strong violation of the 1868 Nationalities  Law. The number of minority-language schools was steadily decreasing:  in the period between 1880 and 1913, when the number of Hungarian-only  schools almost doubled, the number of minority language-schools almost  halved.  
&gt;  
&gt;The process of Magyarization culminated in 1907 with the *lex Apponyi* (named after education minister [Albert Apponyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Apponyi))  which forced all primary school children to read, write and count in  Hungarian for the first four years of their education. From 1909  religion also had to be taught in Hungarian. ""In 1902 there were in Hungary 18,729 elementary schools with 32,020  teachers, attended by 2,573,377 pupils, figures which compare favourably  with those of 1877, when there were 15,486 schools with 20,717  teachers, attended by 1,559,636 pupils. In about 61% of these schools  the language used was exclusively Magyar"".  Approximately 600 Romanian villages were depleted of proper schooling  due to the laws. As of 1917, 2,975 primary schools in Romania were  closed as a result.  
&gt;  
&gt;The census system of the post-1867 Kingdom of Hungary was  unfavourable to those of non-Hungarian nationality. According to the  1874 election law, which remained unchanged until 1918, only the upper  5.9% to 6.5% of the whole population had voting rights.  That effectively excluded almost the whole of the peasantry and the  working class from Hungarian political life. The percentage of those on  low incomes was higher among other nationalities than among the Magyars,  with the exception of Germans who were generally richer. From a  Hungarian point of view, the structure of the settlement  system was based on differences in earning potential and wages. The  Hungarians and Germans were much more urbanised than Slovaks, Romanians  and Serbs in the Kingdom of Hungary.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 1900, nearly a third of the deputies were elected by fewer  than 100 votes, and close to two-thirds were elected by fewer than 1000  votes. Transylvania had an even worse representation: the more Romanian a  county was, the fewer voters it had. Out of the Transylvanian deputies  sent to Budapest, 35 represented the 4 mostly Hungarian counties and the  major towns (which together formed 20% of the population), whereas only  30 deputies represented the other 72% of the population, which was predominantly Romanian.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hungarian authorities put constant pressure upon all non-Hungarians to  Magyarize their names and the ease with which this could be done gave  rise to the nickname of *Crown Magyars* (the price of registration being one korona).  
&gt;  
&gt;Together with Magyarization of personal names and surnames, the  exclusive use of the Hungarian forms of place names, instead of  multilingual usage, was also common.  For those places that had not been known under Hungarian names in the  past, new Hungarian names were invented and used in administration  instead of the former original non-Hungarian names.  
&gt;  
&gt;The eagerness of the Hungarian government in its Magyarization efforts was comparable to that of tsarist [Russification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russification) from the late 19th century.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Magyar national reawakening and the magyarization process triggered national revivals among the [Slovak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_people), [Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_people), [Serbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs), and [Croatian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_people) minorities within [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary) and [Transylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transylvania), who felt threatened by both German and Magyar cultural hegemony. These national revivals later blossomed into the nationalist movements  of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that contributed to the [empire's ultimate collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary#Dissolution_of_the_Empire_in_1918) .

3490,"&gt; Catalan has a significant presence in Spain that Irish cannot be compared with.

Presence within a country has nothing to do with how languages are chosen.

Its a bit egregious saying Catalan should be given preference over another language just because they think its more valuable.

It wasn't. It was peripheral country. Poland proper (Lesser and Greater Poland) was ok but far from northern Italy or Nederlands levels. But rest of the country was quite backward.

&gt; It had a war against Russia

Which one? :)

&gt; they almost won it which would have changed the history entirely.

More details would be great. I suspect 1920 but it wasn't PLC, then.

&gt; But on military perspective they were in a shit geographical position since everything is flat land while also having 3 big powers around them that were greedy for the rich land

It was ""a bit"" more complicated. 3 big powers is late PLC theme. We were fighting with Muscovy/Russia, Sweden, Ottomans to name the most important (and they were not exactly ""these"" 3 powers).

3518,"I don't know about Romania but with regards to other countries there is a ""dominant region"" that usually stands in for the country.

There was no such thing in Poland. There were three dominant regions because from 1795 to 1918 Poland was split between three occupying powers and each power had its ""Poland"" with its Polish cultural centre. In Russian part it was Warsaw (Masovia), in Austrian part it was Cracow (Little Poland) and in Prussian part it was Posnan (Greater Poland). Only after 1918 Warsaw began to rise to prominence but it was modern times and folk traditons were irrelevant and Warsaw was the centre of a new industrial Poland. Before then nobody cared about folk dress and it was the culture of nobility. So when the rise of popular movements in the 19th century 
began we had three popular movements and not one.

Perhaps in Romania it could be the same with the split between the Kingdom and the parts in Austria-Hungary?

Anyway - that is why I am saying that this dress is not representative. Because it would be like going to the US in antebellum and insisting that Yankees from Massachusetts  represent all of America or vice versa.

It was all sort of a bloody sport for the nobility.

As usual - elites play their games and the people pay. Until it became a thing for the masses where the average Turk/Pole/Russian/German was your enemy nobody took it too personal.

For those who don't know, Catalan is spoken in Italy in the city of Alghero and is recognized as a minority language. While the number of speakers is low (it is understood by an estimated 26000 people and spoken by 9000, of which 6000 people use it as a day-to-day language), it has been present in the area since the XIV century when the aragonese kingdom expelled the genoese from the area.

The large blocks of concrete barriers (the ""barriers of peace"" as I've seen them called) being deployed randomly and permanently in European capitals .



Social agitation and distrust , a disconnect between the desires of the rulers and the ruled -- all leading to the rise in Right wing sentiment .



The social ""awakening"" depending on politics , with one side championing intersectionality and 78+ forms of gender , while the other side reverts more and more towards traditionalism, tribalism and the general notion that apart from the right to vote , ""feminism"" was a big fat lie that told women in pretty words to be men -- while at the same time telling them that men were bad .

Google (and u/Antiochia )did point out that in some countries you have to pax a part of your taxes to the church, so I guess you have to inform the government during your next tax declaration? Coming from a secular country, where we don't pay a church tax, I didn't think about it in my previous comment. 

Over than that I can't see any other steps necessary to leave the church than symply choosing not to be part of the church anymore, and living your life in whatever way you feel is best. You can simply ""ghost"" the church, there is no need to officially ""quit"". They are not going to be coming in  to knock on your door every Sunday  morning to bring you to mass, nor is your soul going to be going to Catholic heaven/hell after your death because you stopped believing years ago but didn't sign out. At worst, I guess, your family might give you a religious funeral if you kept your decision it a secret from them. The only reason I could think of to want to be officially deregistered would be if you were abused by a priest and need the closure as part of your healing process.

Do you have any idea how long it takes new fighter aircraft to enter service? And this is not just a normal aircraft, they are trying to build a stealth aircraft. The reason that the Russian, Chinese, and American stealth programs were so delayed is because it's a completely different type of airframe. The entire structure of the plane needs to be designed around minimizing the radar signature. 

&amp;#x200B;

And that's assuming the project even gets approved. How much money will Germany and France be spending on this program when half of Europe will be flying F-35s in 10 years?

*So, dear Lands (or states...I'm sorry) what about secede from ours respective nations/states and join Confoederatio Helvetica? Like, the velvet thing they made in Czechia/Slovakia...if I'm right, not French-feeling-guillotine-related-stuff, no blood, no main battle tanks in squares, not even walls to tear down, just a friendly, PRODUCTIVE, secession, nothing less, nothing more...*

*P.S: if all works out, we could even get others cool regions from others states, like, Emilia-Romagna, Trentino A.A / S. Tirolo (but you must talk with AUT...you know, some still bitter, they don't listen to us) even with France (Bourgogne-Comtè, G.E, Rhone-Alps, just for some wines...).*

*I hope you are going to think about it, on the paper, is not so bad, we all become ""CH"", with all the pros and little cons.*

3842,"&gt; i wouldn't trust the AFD but lets not forget it was the German media which delayed the reporting of the infamous Cologne sexual assault case on new years eve and downplayed any link between the identity of the perpetrators and the recent influx of refugees. 

This is a misconception repeatedly being propagated by Pegida, an anti-islam organization close to the AFD. German media **did** report it on the same day (e.g. https://www.express.de/koeln/silvesternacht-hauptbahnhof--junge-frauen-sexuell-belaestigt-23251504) . Some might have taken some days longer, because, guess what, it was New Year's Eve. Not many people usually work around that time, and sometimes extra time is needed for fact-checking.

Please stop falling for their lies.

3910,"That was really one of the things that the US was really worried about when developing the F-35. Everyone knew that it was going to be a big program and there was a tremendous pressure because people got worried that if they cancelled it after only a few years tons of money would be wasted. The whole project was based on spending hundreds of billions of dollars up front to research and design it so that it would be ""too big to fail"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Even the really successful fighter aircraft like the F-15 or F-18 had a lot of trouble getting developed because unforeseen problems always arise. The F-35 had even more problems because a lot of the design was around stealth and having a vertical takeoff variant which are newer technologies. Everyone knew that it would be delayed, so they had to spend a giant amount of money up front so that it would be politically impossible to cancel the program later on. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Regarding FCAS (or SCAF), the fact that there had to be a battle to  convince the Germans to get Dassault to be the lead on the project is  insane and tells you all you need to know about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that the German military wants to buy the F-35 (the head of the Luftwaffe was fired by Merkel for openly supporting the F-35), but German politicians do not want to buy it because the French government really wants to limit F-35 sales in Europe since they think that it will soon be the only plane that countries buy and will kill off the opportunity to build any new SCAF plane. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the flip-side is that it would take 20-30 years to actually develop and build a SCAF plane while many European Air Forces need to replace all their current planes today which are so old and outdated.

3979,"Honestly reading that graph, it seems that it rose as a result of an economic rebound (as expected, the economy would inevitably be reorganised) and is now continuing expected trends (including the crash of 2008 and the subsequent rebound), so really nothing happened with the collapse in the long term.

Also it should be expected that the economy grew 100% in ten years, the economy started functioning again and people started working at that point, economies don't recover at the same speed that growth occurs as the potential for growth (factories, manpower, resources) are all still present and easily retrieved. Infact, if the economy didn't double in that amount of time I at least would be very surprised, as that would indicate some serious issues with Russia in general.

Infact a very similar thing happened after the bolshevik revolution (as demonstrated here https://antontarasenko.com/2015/08/15/growth-diagnostics-in-russia-2-introduction-to-russia/) as the economy collapsed due to a lack of organisation. Infact it was fixed in much worse conditions considering that they were literally in WW1 and as a country were too reliant on resource extraction that was taken in the treaty of Brest-Litovsk (90% of coal mining, a quarter of industry and agriculture was lost, keep in mind i'm not advocating for Russia keeping nor regaining the countries lost in the treaty such as Finland and Ukraine). The recovery being a a result of the stimulus of the NEP and the later five year plans pre-WW2. Infact the actual economic growth overall rose as industrial production became easier world wide.

3982,"At first, the film seems a straightforward bit of propaganda. It follows the Churrucas, a military family from the countryside. In the first act, set in 1897, the patriarchal father dies heroically in the defence of Spain’s Cuban colony against the United States, leaving his wife to raise three sons and a daughter on her own. Decades later, one son seeks money and power in politics, while the other children pursue more traditional vocations, as soldier, priest and homemaker.

When the civil war arrives, the family is split. Pedro, the wayward son, sides with the Republican government. The others are firmly on the side of Franco. In the end, however, Pedro sees the error of his ways and recants, proving himself a true vessel of the Spanish Raza — just like the rest of the Churruca stock. Ultimately, the family is reunited by the heroism of the anointed son, José, who has risen to power as a military leader for the fascists.

portrays himself as the Spanish national family’s divinely ordained son.

**But Raza was more than just a vanity project: it was an early attempt to shape public memory through film.**

Franco wrote Raza in 1940, just after the end of the civil war. By some estimates half a million people had been killed. Both sides had committed atrocities as they purged their enemies; **after Cambodia, Spain has the second largest number of mass graves in the world.** Although Franco railed against foreign influence in Spain, he had received vital assistance from Italian and German fascists. And, crucially, **he had toppled a democratically elected government.** In other words, the war was complex. **Franco wanted to provide a simpler narrative to serve his purposes: Raza would be the official version of the war.**

Yet Franco’s satisfaction was short-lived. **He had started rewriting history to suit his needs — and, in time, his needs changed. By the end of the decade the fascists had lost World War Two, and Franco’s version of the civil war had to be rewritten to legitimise his power. So in 1950 Franco censored his own film and destroyed every old copy he could find. The title became Espíritu de una Raza (‘Spirit of a Race’). All fascist salutes were cut out. The enemy went from being republicans, masons, bourgeoisie and politicians to simply communists. And the jabs at the US were removed — they were soon to become Spain’s allies. Now, Raza was compatible with the new political contours of the Cold War**.

**It was a fittingly Orwellian twist. Franco’s myth building, of which Raza was just a part, smudged the historical record.** Even now, more than 40 years after his death, there is no consensus on what the civil war and his dictatorship mean. The few polls carried out reveal a lingering ambivalence. One from 2008 showed a majority believed that Francoism had “both good sides and bad sides”. The same poll showed the public opposed to prosecution of former Franco officials, and lukewarm about a truth commission to assign responsibility for the civil war. **Only a tiny minority now believe the Raza version of history, but it may have sowed just enough doubt and confusion to protect its architect’s legacy**.

4033,"&gt; Because Voivodeship Assemblies have pretty narrow and unexciting responsibilities.

Sejmiki have a budget and they are more or less free to spend it. That's enough to be relevant in politics.

&gt;The oversight on executive branch of the government in voivodeships belongs to the voivode (who is not elected, but appointed by the central government). 

Now talking about narrow responsibilities, since 1999 most of central agencies in regions are independent from voivodes and their powers to supervise self-government bodies are limited.


 They are an archaism of times when they had more powers and communications was more problematic.  

I get it, Poland is not a federation but your dichotomy of irrelevant sejmiks and powerful voivodes is simply strange.

&gt; Do you remember any party focusing on winning seats in Masovian Assambly?

Yes, PSL focused on Adam Struzik being a marshall of masovian   sejmik.

Many times.
&gt; What you did hear about was parties battling over Warsaw (and other big cities).

Mostly because media in Poland are centralized in Warsaw (and some other big cities).

&gt; That's because the president of Warsaw has real impact on how things will look locally

I can agree with it.

&gt; he'll also have impact on policies for the entire region.

It also does not help that tonnes of content laws and discrimination of content between Member States makes it a huge bitch to navigate and adapt to (think of the chore it must be for Netflix, a relatively very straightforward simple service) to adapt to each and every location.

I also think that we just do not have much in the ways of innovation, sure we do quite a lot of new discoveries, but innovation in online venture? Not Europe's forte.

Some others also think Youtube will try to crack down on in-video sponsorships, which you could argue work just as good as adverts, but Youtube makes no money off of them.

There also were some small changes made to the video player to make more users go to Youtube pages/apps directly rather than settle for watching embedded videos on other pages.

An interesting thing is that Youtube, albeit its net profit is going down, still has a growing revenue (costs are just growing faster apparently), but it still has one thing Google wants: your information as a consumer; by using Youtube you let Google build a profile of you, what you like, what you care about, etc... which just helps out massively their advert services (the more accurate and widespread network of profiles Google gathers, the better their targetted advert services will become)",LusoFrench citizen living in the Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/9qf9sw/people_could_be_banned_from_uploading_videos_to/e89ayur/,RafaRealness,1540241573

4059,"&gt;Your argument: Economics are the most important thing in life.

No it is not my argument.  
It is a *response* to your statement of:  
&gt;Secondly economy is sub-servant to people which means it is secondary subject to whole debacle.  

If the disatisfaction and employment status of british people is one of the primary drivers of the leave campaign, how will fucking up the economy for even *more* people solve that issue?  
Or is it more that you're a believer in the mantra of ""Burn all the houses and we'll all be equally cold outside.""?  

&gt;when you are occupied you should just let it go and don't fight because it is more economically viable to continue occupation than fight against it.  

You're comparing a nazi occupation in the last world war and a voluntary membership in the EU and expecting people to take you seriously?  

I'm going to leave this and then stop replying to you.  
You need to decide what it is you want to argue in favour of. Democracy, or totalitarianism.  
If a nation stops listening to its people after one vote, it's no longer a democracy.  
You get to keep on voting for what matters to you in a democracy, even if it is a hopeless cause.  
Winning one vote by a razor thin margin after a campaign of misinformation, electoral finance fraud and lies by the campaign leaders does not justify telling half the nation that they have to shut up and take it.  
To quote your you *own argument*:  
&gt;If this is true then when you are occupied you should just let it go and don't fight because it is more economically viable to continue occupation than fight against it.  

This is why I say your argument is failing. You keep arguing for the thing you just said you disliked in previous comments and you fail to see how it's hypocritical.

Since the government can't favour one religion over another it had a choice - either remove the law or create a one that applies equally to all faiths.

People in China have Mao shrines in their homes where they burn incense and put place sacrificial food on special occasions.

These are cults of leadership, they have A LOT of similarities with organized religion like Islam or Christianity. Obviously they see religion - or any other rival ideology really - as competition to their totalitarian rule. When you look at it closely these regimes crack down on everyone, even former allies with similar ideas.

Another thing that bothers me, maybe even more so: OP said ""we"" as in non-religious people. You automatically equvate that with atheism. The article didn't say anything about all those people being atheists, instead it spoke of people ""not affiliated to a religious group"". I'm not an atheist, but I'm not religious. There are many others out there who aren't either.

And yet none has declared the treaty illegal, otherwise it wouldnt be in force.

And I know a thing or two about little judiciary independence. I also know that opponents could up the ante and bring the case to ECHR as was the case in Italy when it rejected migrants back to Libya during Berlusconi government. I am not aware of any ECHR pending cases on Spain in regards to this issue, but I dont keep a full track so I might have missed something.

Spain is part of many international organizations. But you specifically mentioned EU resolutions and CoE has no authority over EU resolutions. Neither does CoE for that matter, what you linked to is report of one of CoE agencies, but not a resolution that has to be adopted by CoE itself.

4214,"No, this is just the common misinterpretation of these words, as the original meaning is sadly lost for the common people due to the media is just throwing them around. Sorry for the incoming wall of text.

Republic is a form of government, not a description of democracy or representation. It means that the government is the elected representation of the citizens of the nation, and positions are not inherited (and have term limits). It is in direct opposition with monarchy (which still can be a democracy). Direct or indirect electoral systems are independent from the republic.

A republic is also not equal with presidency, where the leader of the administrative branch (government) is also the head of the state: the president. Presidencies usually have quite high amount of power in the hand of the president.

Democracy is the form of an electoral system (rule of the people). It means that the citizens vote for representation under law. A democracy is not necessarily a republic, there are democracies that are monarchies, where the head of the state is a non-elected monarch. It is expected that in a democracy every voter have the same amount of power (their votes worth the same), if that is not the case we are talking about a weighted-voting system.

Some examples:

The US is a presidential republic, because the president is elected with term limits. The US is not a democracy because the votes are not equal due to the Electoral College which bears two hundred years of political deals which makes certain states to have votes worth multiple times than some other states. It's also a gerrymandered mess of a winner-takes-all system, where the ones lost get zero representation (instead of proportionately lower) within their own district. It is still somewhat democratic as the distortion is fairly low and one could argue that the intention is not necessarily anti-democratic behind it (stop the silencing of the smaller states).

France is a democracy and presidential republic.  
The UK is a democracy and monarchy.  
Germany is a non-presidential democracy and a republic (Angela Merkel is the head of the government as the chancellor (prime minister in many countries), while the head of the state is the president).",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/9q654p/an_aerial_shot_of_the_700000_brexit_protestors_in/e88s1ry/,ede91,1540226283

4261,"&gt;I'm from a part of England that voted heavily for leave, like many of  those areas they will be the hardest hit should manufacturing/EU focused  export industries be damaged by this. That's not looking out for  ourselves, it's self harm.

The self harm occurred while being a member of the EU. The number of UK companies that were sold off to foreign businesses was scandalous e.g. Jaguar. Now we have that company's CEO, a German, scaremongering about the risks of Brexit.

&gt;As for ourselves, there are parts of England that probably have more in common with Scotland and NI than other parts of England.

I agree. There are large parts of England that have been overrun due to high immigration levels that they barely resemble England anymore.

&gt; Maybe England can also start breaking into little bits till it's just some street with a pub full of angry blokes.

I don't think we have to go that far but perhaps some separation would be of benefit. Westminster has always favoured the South of England and while that is allowed to occur the rest of England and the UK will continue to suffer as a result. NI has its assembly while Wales and Scotland have their own governments. Northern England has nothing and has suffered the most with a lack of investment and no power so change is needed.

&gt;Whilst the UK has had its problems and also historically caused a few, I  think largely in the last century it's been a positive arrangement for  both ourselves (we're collectively one of the worlds largest economies),  and also positive in terms of our impact on the world.

This has been in the main due to England. I'm not saying the other union members don't contribute anything but they're quite tiny by comparison.

&gt;I'm equally sure many people would disagree about the value brought by Scotland &amp; NI, not least the people who live there.

I would expect so too since they're heavily biased.

&gt;If you see the future of England specifically, as being a comparatively  small nation, with a medium gdp and very little influence on world  affairs then fine, nothing wrong with that as such. I don't see how it's  an improvement on what we have now, which is an awesome, fairly unique  collection of countries with shared culture, history and even family.

We are not a small nation. Without us there is no union. What we have now isn't working. Outside of the EU maybe we can stay together, minus NI, but if not then it will not be the end of the world, for us at least.

The reality is that people are irrational and no amount of artificial knowledge will ever change that. Abandoning religion and other traditions is only a sign that we are focusing our irrationality to somewhere else. 

By the looks of it, in our modern society we focus it on embracing hyperactive materialism and rampant individualism where everyone has an irrational feed of media in their pockets and they build their own personal bubble of irrational preferences and behavior according to it... Morals are basically driven by social media. 

Why does this new ""rational"" and ""enlightened"" human behave more irrationally than ever before in history, even if he was more religious?

You would need to pick a different time range definition in order for Islam to be the only faith on the rise. However, looking only at a one year period by comparing 2016 to 2017, Islam remained constant at 5.1%, so it is not on the rise.

So, in order for your claim of Islam being the only faith on the rise to hold you would need to cherry pick the definition of a faith ""being on the rise"" quite a bit: it holds only when taking a time window larger than 1 year but smaller than 5 years.

If they are found by the school to be routinely trying to influence the politics of the children then they should face some sort of sanction by the school.

4421,"&gt; The budget/role differences between the two airplanes is not disputed, but that doesn't mean no-one would buy the F-22.

Never said nobody would, I just implied more countries would be interested in an aircraft of a role more comparable to that of the F-35 than the F-22. Specifically Western countries. 

&gt; The F-15 is also fulfills an air superiority role, and it got bought by Japan, Korea, Singapore, Israel and Saudi.

Indeed but those countries have very specific needs that don't translate that well to European/Western countries, hence why nobody but the countries you listed bought the F-15. 

&gt; These American allies would probably have considered the F-22, were it available.

Oh yeah, little doubt about that but again, these are highly specific cases and this does not hold true for Western countries(ignoring Israel). The Americans also refused to sell it for obvious reasons so :/

&gt; But it isn't, and at least Japan, Korea and Israel are getting F-35s, partially because there just isn't anything else in the market if you wanna buy American.

Or perhaps more importantly because the F-35 is fifth generation multi-role fighter without peers? Its an aircraft role any decent country would wanna fill provided they've got the dough. 

&gt; Not so sure about the F-35 being less stealthy than the F-22, however. Wikipedia quotes an Air Force General saying the F-35 ""compares favorably"" to the F-22 in that regard. Although that stuff ain't exactly public record so who knows, could be a sales pitch.

Sales pitches doesn't count for much as buyers put the aircraft to grueling tests. Any person with rudimentary physics knowledge can put stealth capabilities to the test. They test the RCS of these aircraft, couldn't get away with lying about stealth capabilities. 

The Americans would never get away with bullshit claims about the stealth capabilities of a stealth aircraft. It would be highly detrimental to every facet of America's relationship with the world. 

They are indeed very stealthy. To begin with not as stealthy as the F-22, which is ridiculously stealthy but stealthier than anything else of a comparable role. 

There has been a decent amount of talk of the F-35 using new breakthrough radar absorbent materials that would negate some of the less stealthy aspects of the design and perhaps make it even stealthier than the F-22, provided the F-22 can't utilize that same technology.

Even in the [""High Migration"" scenario of Pew Research](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/11/29/europes-growing-muslim-population/), the share of Muslims in the EU in 2050 is projected to be 14.7%, in the Netherlands 15.2%.  
With the current border closings, Merkel's Turkey deal, the Mediterranean route becoming more hostile etc., I personally view it as quite unlikely that this high migration scenario will come true. So we're looking at even lower numbers.  

People just have no idea how few Muslims are in Europe right now relative to Europeans. There are over 500m people in the EU. Currently the share of Muslims in Europe is 4.9%, any birth rate difference in order to get to &gt;50% would have to be absolutely unreal. Furthermore, as Muslims in Europe tend to be centered in a few countries and almost nonexistent in Spain, Portugal, Visegrad, the Baltics, Finland, Norway, Ireland, Romania ..., they'd either have to spread to these countries (unlikely) or make up a **massive** majority of France, Germany, Belgium, UK etc. - which is even more unreal.

So up with the Russian Military Budget from $70 flat to $175 billion. While this is now closer to the ~$230 billion of EU NATO countries that value also would increase since I would have to increase the non German budgets by the respective factor. Which I wont.

But the Russian Military Budget of $70 billion is already at over 5% of their GDP. The estimate for tax revenue in 2016 was $200 billion. So ~35% of the tax revenue goes into defense. ~30% if you take into account credits instead of only revenue.

4485,"&gt; a 'uniform European identity'

That is something created in the last 3-4 decades, it was not there ever before, not even as back as in the Roman Empire. When we are learning about our history in schools we basically learn the long list of wars that were happening locally for centuries, and some of the notable wars that were happening at the same time in other parts of the continent.

&gt; Europeans enjoyed great advances by learning from Roman, Greek and Mesopotamian sources.

This happened through trade, not some exceptionalism of europeans. African kingdoms did just as much trading with the arabs just as indians and europeans did (the arabs were holding and distributing large amount of knowledge around the first millennia, including mathematics and modern numbers).

&gt; The Romans and Greeks would view them higher than their European brethren of their proximity.

Are you talking about North African and coastal Middle East cultures, like the late Egyptian Empire (Ptolemaic Kingdom), Chartago and such? Because before the 6th century these cultures were so largely influenced by greeks (and later romans, also conquered) that they were largely greek settlers who funded city states in these areas. The greek influence in the Mediterranean Basin before the turn of the first millennia was insane (only overtaken by the roman influence).",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/9qbcjo/the_world_economy_in_2017/e88czdh/,ede91,1540212394

&gt;Responding to a reporter's remark that at the EU summit on Thursday Mogherini had said that Zeljko Komsic was elected in line with existing law, Plenkovic said that he was not speaking in terms of legality.

&gt;""My intervention was not in terms of legality, but in terms of a serious, major political problem, where the political will of a constituent ethnic group can be circumvented because of an inadequate legal framework. Their equality must be reflected in institutions,"" Plenkovic said.

&gt;Plenkovic has mounted a diplomatic offensive to draw attention to the fact that Zeljko Komsic has been elected the Croat member of Bosnia and Herzegovina's presidency with Bosniak votes, what he said was ""against the spirit of the Dayton agreement"" which ended the country's 1992-95 war. He discussed the matter with French President Emmanuel Macron during a visit to Paris on Tuesday, and raised the issue again at a meeting of EU leaders on Thursday.",,/r/europe/comments/9qcmas/croatia_has_a_responsibility_towards_bosnian/e8882gh/,badblueboy146,1540204969

This is because Catholics more than most Christian denominations identify with their denomination more than it simply being a denomination.

4645,"&gt;So basically the past British governments have been pushing for policies  within the EU institutions but since you don't like them, instead of  being honest and saying ""we don't like those policies that our past  governments help implement"" you choose ""the EU is persecuting us""  erasing your own sovereign responsibility regarding those policies and  nicely erasing the fact your State was able to get several exceptions  regarding those EU policies. But somehow your are caged and persecutes  by the EU,.... not your past governments.

It isn't simply a case of the government being at fault and free movement is only one issue. Our government should be able to be held accountable all of the time but this isn't possible while being a member of the EU. There have been tens of thousands of laws introduced by the EU in the last 25 years. Sovereignty is about bringing power/control back to the people. Controlling the way our country is run and having the ability to directly influence this is key.

&gt;Can be more vague and propagandistic than that. According to you want  will change specifically regarding borders than isn't implemented today?

It means the end to free movement. Choosing who and who isn't allowed in as I said in my earlier comment. I don't consider that vague at all.

Our political parties base their manifestos on those things that their membership vote for, and what their party believes in. The people then vote for the party.

So, to fit your question into how our government works. If a party stood on a manifesto of not leaving the EU, or holding another referendum, and they were voted for by a majority and formed a government, then yes I would reluctantly support it as what the majority of this country wish to do.

However as one of your other replies put it - the Lib Dems did exactly that just over a year ago, and they could not be further from forming a government. They don't even have enough MPs to cover the inner cabinet.

The other thing I would accept would be a formal petition to the government, having verifiably more than 17.4m votes from those eligible to vote.

&gt;The appeal court based its decision in part on the fact that PVL says  it does not consider all races to be equal. The ruling also noted that  PVL idealises fascism, is anti-Semitic and has infringed on the rights  of sexual minorities.  
&gt;  
&gt;The court stated that the neo-Nazi group has  embraced violence and criminal offences committed in the name of the  organisation and its values, and therefre ruled that this kind of  activity is not protected by law.

----------

4911,"&gt; It seems like, in your haste to post that, you missed the target intirely. All of your points work towards my hypothesis. The more countries use the F-35 the lower the costs per plane/maintenence, so it makes sense for the US to direct allies into buying F-35s than F-22s.

As I said, this principle applies to *any* equipment, including the F-22. Whether its exported or remains exclusive to the US wouldn't matter much to the US military because they would still be the primary buyer by a huge margin regardless, just like the F-35. 

The F-22 would have gotten somewhat cheaper if it was exported. But the F-35 would still be much cheaper even if it wasn't exported at all.

A lot of work was done to try to make the F-22 cost effective most notably the addition of air to ground capabilities to expand its use beyond the very limited role it excelled at, but none of it justified the price in greater numbers than whats currently fielded. Even if the actual unit price was much closer to the F-35 and twice as many F-22's were ordered something similar to the F-35 would still have been designed and adopted at much greater numbers.

&gt; I did not ""complain"" about the JSF program cost, and it seems a bit strange that you thought I did. Yet it was more expensive than the F-22, I'm sure you'll agree.

The fact you brought it up at all shows you have the same misconceptions that most people who shit on the F-35 have regarding economics. And yes, a program that results in an aircraft that costs half as much as an aircraft from a different program that has 1/15th as many sales *is* in fact more ""expensive"", on that we completely agree.

&gt; I also don't see where I suggested anyone was obliged to buy F-35 or support its development. It sorta seems like you just wanted to throw shade at the European aerospace industry and were looking for an excuse to paste that wall in f text

Well according to the comment I replied to the ban on F-22 exports made it so that allies ""had"" to ""buy into"" the F-35 project. Meaning they wanted the F-22, were denied by the US, and had to go for the F-35. 

An aircraft portrayed as the biggest piece of shit military boondoggle ever conceived of, yet still apparently has a technological edge that's just as far out of reach of European aerospace competitors as the F-22 was.",,/r/europe/comments/9q65d7/belgium_seen_picking_lockheed_f35_over_eurofighter/e87risl/,76DJ51A,1540176959

Brod, Bojkovice, Ostrava, Brno, etc... Some cities had scars from the war till 70s because they were not a priority for a reconstruction unlike Ostrava or northwestern Bohemia. Both of my parents survived air raids in 1944-1945 and talked about it.

Moravia was more targeted than Bohemia, because RAF and the USAF wanted to disrupt railway connections between Silesia and Vienna/Lower Austria. Moravia was a secondary target for raids to Silesia. In Brno, about 1/4 of all homes were destroyed or damaged. The city center was totally burned from the main train station up to Ceska street. There is a book called 'Bomby nad Brnem' by Milena Flodrova published 14 years ago about this subject. 

RAF promised Benes that it will not bomb Prague, and Brits upheld the promised to the end of the WWII. Only USAF and Luftwaffe targeted the city. Otherwise from the large cities in Bohemia under the Protectorate, only Pilsen, Pardubice, Kolin, and Ceske Budejovice were targeted, and some smaller cities that had a strategic value like Kralupy due petrochemical plant. Sudetenland as a part of Germany, was targeted from Cheb to Chomutov to Most to Usti to Decin. Generally, Czechs in Bohemia felt that WWII spared them, but Moravians and Slovaks did not share the same feeling.

Get what, I posted an example that shows why what you say is ridicules, want more, how about Greeks, they will tell you they are not Scandinavian, is it because they feel it is a shameful thing to be Scandinavian?  

Czech, besides speaking a vaguely familiar language, have nothing more in common with countries like Russia or Bulgaria than East Germany does. **Nothing** .The architecture is consistent with that of Austria or Germany, the geography is the same, the weaponry and armor (knights) has been consistent with Austria and Germany, The food, and beverages, specifically beer, is similar to that of Austria and Germany, the way the people have dressed throughout history s similar to that of Germany and Austria. They have even been part of the same country, Holy Roman Empire and Austria-Hungary. Even Ethnically they have tons of German heritage. If it they spoke German hen nobody would deny they are just another Austrian/Bavarian like state. And somehow the [sorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbs) are Western European? Calling Czech EE is simply ridicules, and a result of ignorance about their culture and history. 
The same applies to Poland although that have more in common because of their Sarmatism movement although only a fraction of their history and that's why Central Europe is more appropriate, because it includes elements of both east and west.

&gt;who think countries like Russia or Ukraine are some sort of nuclear wasteland and they would never want to be put with them in the same basket

Wow hold on, where are you getting this. show me where someone wrote this, prove it or stop making up nonsense to fit your narrative. But EE is generaly poorer. How suprising that fairly wealthy countries like Czech and Poland dont want to be called a term almost synonymous with poverty and Orthodox Christianity. which they are not. 

&gt;And please don't try to tell me this is simply a geographic issue, because it is not.

Its a geographic issue. And you will prove its not how? Consider this if brick gothic archetecture originated in Saudi Arabia and minarets came from France, would minarets still be an eastern thing? Culture gets associated with certian regions because it is in that region, this should be obvious to you based on the fact that geographic terms are being used. Now the geographic center of Europe is in Lithuania, the only way countires **west of that** can be *Eastern* is if they were culturaly, which they are not.

5064,"&gt; It's not a hypothetical, his disapproval rating is over 50% which is unusual for Presidents. Trump's approval rating is at a relative high of 42% right now. If I remember correctly he has literally never been popular with half the population. Even among the 42% that ""approve"" right now, he's only very popular with part of that cohort. That number of Americans that he is ""insanely"" popular with is probably 30%.

you did not understand a thing I wrote - my main point is - biased media will find some way to pump up numbers in direction they want it to be. Thats why nobody cares about polls.

If you were Trump supporter and you saw a poll that he is very unpopular - would that make you change your mind?

&gt; I dunno wtf you're talking about, but I know plenty of places where it's cool to be a Trump supporter and people who don't like him keep their mouths shut.

really?

&gt; But if there's no candidate at all he has no one to attack.

? so the idea is not to nominate anyone until the day of elections?

anyway - you do know that there will be democratic primaries - unless its Hillary and nobody chalenges.

Trump will have plenty of time to attack, so what is the point of delaying - if iits not Hillary.

&gt; &gt; This piece of conventional wisdom is not true at all. Every time there's a scandal Trump's approval ratings drop. The GOP has already suffered catastrophic electoral defeats since 2016 because of Trump scandals.

let me guess - you have poll numbers to back this mantra up.

&gt; Trump cares enormously what people think of him, tons of people who worked or have worked for him have said he's obsessed with approval ratings.

yes - he cares when it matters - on election day - right  now? he doesnt care 

let me guess again - you heard read and watched rumors on TV that he is obsessed with approval ratings?

&gt; What do you want to bet that Hillary will be the Dem nominee? I'd stake a decent amount of money on it because literally no one wants her.

I am not betting anything. I dont care if she is or if she is not. I am just presenting my own opinion and discussing politics on internet.

why are you so invested in ""its not going to be Hillary"" ?

5071,"... that statements so absurd it falls into the ""not even wrong category"".

The overall cost of *any* large military program is a useless metric because increased program costs typically mean more of the product is being used which lowers the operating cost of individual pieces of equipment. The more F-35's (or any other piece of hardware, but especially aircraft) there are the more parts will be produced and put into circulation which lowers the maintenance costs.

People who complain about the amount of money we're projected to spend globally on the F-35 over the next half century just can't comprehend basic economics. By the logic they employ the fact that Japan, South Korea are importing the F-35 and a lot of other nations like Belgium considering it is a horrible development for the program because it's costs will rise for every new order, even though it will drive the cost of the plane itself down.

And allies didn't ""buy into"" anything, there was never any obligation to purchase an F-35. They payed minuscule fractions of their defense into R&amp;D and in return relieved themselves of some of the political poison of admitting European aerospace would never cooperate enough to mach the scope of what Lockheed was offering by granting their own industry access to contracts worth vastly more.

And the contributions of partners amount to nothing when you consider the're mostly wealthy nations with multi-billion dollar a year defense budgets. About 60 billion was spent in the R&amp;D phase of development and the US was over 90% of that, and that money was spent over 15 years.

3-rd citation from your source:  


&gt;In January 1945, there were 2,888 deaths at Dachau and 3,977 deaths in February 1945. By the time the American liberators reached the Dachau camp, there was no more coal left to stoke the crematory and bodies had been left lying on the ground. Their clothing had been removed and given to still living prisoners.

&gt;Hugh Carlton Greene, a journalist with the BBC, reported that there were more than 2,000 corpses lying on the ground inside the camp in various stages of decay. He said that he witnessed some of the US soldiers vomiting.

&gt;Dan Dougherty said that there were around 8,000 corpses at Dachau, including the dead bodies on the train, the bodies stacked outside the crematorium and the pile of dead German soldiers who had been shot by the liberators. Lt. William Cowling thought that there were 1,000 corpses. Other estimates ran as high as 10,000 bodies in the Dachau camp, a number that was comparable to what the British had found at Bergen-Belsen on April 15, 1945.

5311,"The United Kingdom cannot be described in the same terms. It is a union of different peoples who form one nation, a nation that exists only because those peoples who comprise it wish it to. Whereas the European Union is a union which exists above, and rules supranationally over, 28 nations.

&amp;#x200B;

Fundamentally, there is no single European demos, you claim there is, but you must surely know there isn't. Pro-EU civil society groups only exist because of European Union funding. If that funding wasn't there, they wouldn't exist.

We saw this with the EUYO, something claimed by President Juncker as 'the best possible ambassador for the European Union.' When the orchestra was informed it wasn't to receive funding it announced that it would 'cease operations.' A month later some money was found by the European Union to keep it up and running.

In the TFEU (Art. 167) it is stated that the EU's role in this area is to, 

&gt;contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and *at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore.*

To the fore, at the front, in a place of primacy. 

Everything the European Union does in these areas is to create the New European Man, but without its funding its civil society groups are unable to sustain themselves. I feel that they will eventually succeed in getting their United States of Europe and that's why I wish to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know it is you're claiming 'one of the most often state reasons (for leaving)' is, no doubt it is something pulled out of a hat to solidify your own position.

To me, Britain should leave the European Union for mainly one reason, to ensure its survival and independence as a nation. Something that, along with English law and our parliamentary democracy, is greatly under threat in a union which seeks to form a single European nation. The United Kingdom is a subordinate of the European Union, our Houses of Parliament cannot reverse a decision taken by the European Commission.

No most people who voted Remain are in well off areas and less likely to be effected by Brexit. Leave was actually areas most likely to be effected. Strange as it might seem that is what happened.

&gt;Then parliament pretended it was binding and let May dig the UKs own grave like there is no representational democracy at all.

No it was said before the vote by the Prime Minister David Cameron who sided with Remain that this would be a final vote on the matter and the final say. It may not be legally binding but it was put to the public as a one off vote with no going back.

&gt;It's two years later and the people know more. Why is it a problem to have another referendum? why not double-check before you follow through with the decision of the century?

Because there are no polls showing any significant change in opinion. If there had been a large shift in opinion towards Remain then the government would be under huge pressure to have another referendum but that hasn't happened.

5375,"Re: WWII, not accurate. [Aid was being sent as soon as the months following Barbarossa in mid-1941, long before Stalingrad/Kursk.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease#US_deliveries_to_the_Soviet_Union) And I agree that Stalin was a garbage military planner, but he was still in the best position to assess who was helping or hindering the war effort from the Soviet perspective. 

Re: NATO expansion, the world doesn't run on non-binding personal assurances. If it was such a critical security need for Russia that NATO not expand, they should have formalized it in a binding treaty. Not that Russia has demonstrated any particular respect for treaties that they've signed, as we saw from the recent U.S. withdrawal from the INF following numerous Russian violations, or the Budapest Memorandum guaranteeing peace with Ukraine if they gave up their nukes.

Re: ""hostile military alliance,"" I'm not sure you can name anything NATO has actually done to directly undermine Russian security. Again, you just seem define our presence as inherently hostile, but NATO is a defensive treaty: an attack against one is an attack against all. Unless Russia was planning on carrying out offensive action against the current NATO members like the Baltics (which wouldn't surprise me), NATO's presence has had precisely zero effect on them. To genuinely threaten Russia would require major land forces to be present in eastern Europe, but I'd be surprised if there are even 20,000 troops stationed further east than Germany. The Nazis invaded with 3 million and still lost, so it's pretty absurd to portray 20,000 as an existential threat. 

Re: Yugoslavia, you've gotta work on your friend group. NATO got involved b/c of U.N.-confirmed ethnic cleansing, later formally designated to be a genocide. I understand that Russians don't seem to think that's a big deal given all the killing inflicted on them by their own leaders over the 20th century, but it is for western Europeans who aren't prepared to accept that kind of slaughter on their doorstep. And as an aside, you'll notice that once again many of your ""friends in Yugoslavia"" rushed to join NATO as soon as they could following independence. I'm sure there's still some Slavic affinity, but they don't want to be your friends in a geopolitical sense. 

Re: Georgia, only five countries recognize the existence of an independent Abkhazia and South Ossetia, with Russia being one. Nobody else seems to agree with your version of events, which should prompt a rational person to reassess their understanding of what happened. 

Re: Ukraine, if the Russian definition of a military threat extends to handing out cookies and making speeches, you're more vulnerable than I thought. Russia is free to use those same tactics, provided they identify themselves as Russians unlike their attempts to influence U.S. elections. But they realize they can't win in a war of ideas with the West, which is why they resort to little green men and motorcycle gangs.

I never said that. I said that a democracy has mechanisms to address its problems and malfunctions without breaking the law, and that is definitely the case in Spain.

&gt; Let me also mention how the whole victim blaming rhetorics in politics is a term that was coined in the US to describe the treatment powers gave to the racial struggle.

Sure, you can mention it, but that does not mean that it is related at all with the discussion.

&gt; Lets remember how we have many Spanish leaders saying how Catalan independentists (which account 8% of the Spanish population) must be ""disinfected"" of their political feelings, so go figure...

It was not ""many Spanish leaders"" but one Catalan politician (funny how he suddenly becomes Spanish instead of Catalan when it suits you) and he did not talk about ""disinfect political feelings"" but about healing the wounds. I recommend watching [this interview](https://youtu.be/dq1yEAWHJJ4) (he talks exactly about that at around 4.15)

&gt; Which leaves us with the actual dilemma: How can the actual right thing happen, if the people who are in power (and that are a consistent, unsurmountable demographic majority) aren't ever going to allow it —because they reject reality, because it doesn't suit their interests, etc?

Well, we won't know if it can be done unless you at least try. And if it does not work today, that does not mean that it won't happen tomorrow.

THAAD is not effective against ICBM, only against warheads, Therefore if you need to destroy over 5000 warhead (real and fake) you would need to shoot maybe 20-30 thousands of THAAD and Patrirot missiles, as you can see, clearly impossible.

However, if NATO destroys Russia first with a nuclear strike, then the retaliatory strike would carry maybe only a couple dozens missiles which could be neutralized by such systems. Then that is what those systems are for.

5468,"Do you consider the Samsung's appstore an alternative to the Google Play store? Again, not even relevant anyway. 

You aren't forced to use GApps, but that isn't the issue either. You seem to misunderstand what the issue is. 

The commission received complaints about anti-competitive behaviour from Google. They investigated and found 3 cases. I'll explore the case of bundling software.

1. Google has a monopoly on mobile operating system licensing. They don't face any significant competition in this area. Google bundles all their software together. This is a fact. 
2. Ship one Google application, most notably the Play Store, and you have to ship all of them. This is a fact.
3. It is nearly impossible to ship a competitive phone in the EU without the Google Play store. Again, this is a fact. Even phones that do have their own alternatives also ship with the Play Store. Some people like to claim Apple also has their own app store, but Apple doesn't sell mobile operating systems. Only Google does. 
4. As a result, pretty much every phone ships with applications like Google Search and Google Chrome. This is a fact.
5. Consequentially, and the Commission has evidence for this, Google Search and Google Chrome have a disproportionally large market share on Android when compared to platforms like iOS. This proves that Google's bundling requirement gives them an \*\*unfair\*\* advantage over companies that don't have a monopoly over operating system licensing. 
6. As a result, Google must decouple its Play Store from its other apps, so other companies can compete fairly.

You can keep saying ""but other companies make their own alteratives"", but that's not the issue here. The issue here is that Google has an unfair advantage because their alternatives will always be included. This unfair advantage is furthermore demonstrable, as pointed out previously.

Exactly how has the EU Commission done a poor job here? It did exactly what it should. I don't think someone can claim this isn't anti-competitive without claiming that anti-competitive practises don't exist. 

Another common misunderstanding is that Google is being anti-competitive to the consumer of the phone. That's false. The consumer of a phone can just buy an Apple device. Google is being anti-competitive towards their clients - the phone manufacturers. ",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/9oq755/google_to_charge_phone_makers_for_android_apps_in/e86nkj4/,JBinero,1540140819

[Read this for a start](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/)

Personally I don't know if I should call Trump a fascist. Maybe he is, but his actions make him look like a conman to me, like a sleazy  salesman, rather than a fascist.

But I do think Bannon is a fascist. Why I think that is complicated, it is because of many actions he has taken, it is not something that I can point to.

I tried to explain it in [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/9q1urw/nicola_sturgeon_quits_bbc_event_over_steve_bannon/e86ee2k/). I don't know how much of a good job I did. But basically if all he wants to do is take power away from the corrupt elites and give it to the people, then why all the lies, why all the deception?

What has he done to help the people while he was Trump's strategist?

To me it seems that the most mild interpretation of his ideology is some kind of paleoconservatism, basically he wants to go back to how capitalism and US society used to be, with very little state interference. In my opinion this would only make the elites stronger, and things would be worse for the average person.

He also said that he thinks the judeochristian west is in the early stages of a very bloody war against islamists. This is the worst case scenario, where he sees himself as some kind of warrior in a religious war against the islamists. This would make him a fascist in my opinion.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/9q1urw/nicola_sturgeon_quits_bbc_event_over_steve_bannon/e86ff2p/,bobama123,1540133252

Another person might primarily see himself as a European. Citizenship is never an absolute guarantee of having a palpable sense of belonging. Otherwise the movement for Scottish independence would be a nonentity.

But that’s not here nor there. Your assertion was that the EU is an empire because it is a multinational entity with a central governing authority. However the UK can clearly be described in the very same terms which alone easily shows how insufficient your definition of ‘empire’ is. What it’s most obviously lacking is the fundamental inequality of rights that is inherent in any imperial configuration. That’s what’s supposed to make the charge of ‘imperialism’ sting after all. A voluntary union of equal member states who’s populations all share the same rights and potential to shape the way they’re governed can never be an empire, unless of course that union also rules over some third party as a colonial possession. The UK though is no such third party, no ‘vassal state’. Otherwise you wouldn’t have the right to vote in EU parliamentary elections or have a say in how the commission is composed.

(Either that or someone else can take over their nesting plot.)

Year-round setup especially applies to urban geese: there's always a thawed lawn somewhere. Even a few populations of strictly migratory greylag geese started to adopt the year-round pattern in big cities.

Anyways, where did you get the idea that I personally was afraid to debate him?

&gt; That is what democracy is built on free speech and open public debate.

That's a nice sentiment, but ancient democracies would ostracise people for speaking openly in public. Plato never could forgive democracy for electing to kill his teacher Socrates, who at his trial for corrupting the youth with dangerous ideas made a principled argument for something that we today would say resembles free speech. Democracies come in many variations, they're not some pure concept. Unless you're a Platonist.

I doubt Bannon is an advocate for free speech except where it concerns himself. Traditional societies do not have free speech, that's something that came from political modernity. And with free speech followed secularism, which was no longer suppressed by traditional authorities, and secularism was another mistake, according to Bannon, because it eroded away the traditions of Judeo-Christian enlightened Capitalism. 

&gt; If Nicola had wanted to legitimize right wing opinions then she should have been listening and debating them all along.

Wut? Maybe you should read your sentence again.

and non-racists wouldn't ""take pride"" in being called racist, in fact they would attempt to shed that badge of shame and not wear it as a badge of honor......unless you really are racists

And there wrong democracy is messy because it must be to solve difficult problems. If your democracy isn't a constant battle ground of opposing view points its not a real democracy.

The main give-away is that they usually describe Paris as some uniform monolith of a city - Paris is monstrously huge, and very diverse in its settings, architecture, people, and places. There's a world in difference between, say, Montmatre and Belleville, or Batignolle and La Defense.

That said, I spent three months living in Paris and returned multiple times on vacation, and I've rarely ever experienced a lot of trash in the city anymore than in my own country's capitol (Copenhagen) which is quite clean, almost never encountered particularly rude people, and found it relatively affordable if you take some time to look around rather than barging into the nearest and most convenient store/restaurant/bar near you.

&gt;Italy’s populist government has relished defying the European Union, and its latest showdown with Brussels could threaten the continent’s fragile recovery—and the global economy.

&gt;*Article by James McBride*

&gt;Italy’s expansionary budget plans are drawing the ire of the European Union (EU). A confrontation could destabilize the Italian economy, one of the EU’s largest, and potentially plunge Europe back into crisis.

&gt;**What’s going on?**

&gt;EU members are supposed to follow the bloc’s budget rules limiting government debt and deficits. But Italy’s new proposals for 2019 ignore previous commitments to reduce both of these, in favor of expanding welfare and cutting taxes.

&gt;Italy’s leaders have been on a collision course with the EU since taking power earlier in 2018. They say the bloc’s technocratic rules have caused economic malaise and blame EU-imposed austerity for the country’s double-dip recession after the 2008 financial crisis. Since then, Italy’s growth has trudged along at under 1 percent, behind most other European economies, and its youth unemployment still tops 30 percent, exceeded only by Greece and Spain. Rome wants more spending, which it says will boost growth, productivity, and employment and, in turn, make servicing the debt easier in the years ahead.

&gt;Meanwhile, the government’s borrowing costs are rising. Government bond yields—a measure of how much the government pays to issue debt—have nearly doubled since May to their highest level in four years. This means investors see Italy as an increasingly risky bet.

&gt;**Why does this matter outside Italy?**

&gt;*There are several big reasons.*

&gt;Systemic financial risk in the EU. At more than $2.6 trillion, Italy has the world’s fourth-largest total debt load. At roughly 131 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), it’s more than twice what EU rules allow. If investors get spooked and bond yields spike, as happened to crisis-ridden European economies in 2010–2012, Italy’s debt payments could spiral out of control. That could mean an Italian default, which would hit banks across Europe that hold Italian sovereign bonds. Italian banks, still weak from the last crisis, hold a lot of these bonds. If they continue to lose value, banks could fail, lending could dry up, and economic growth could plummet again—the so-called banking doom loop. And if Italy takes the unprecedented step of leaving the euro currency and returning to the lira, it would cause massive losses to investors across the continent, potentially triggering another financial crisis.

&gt;**2.6 trillion Italy's government debt in dollars**

&gt;If the eurozone is threatened, Italy would be too big to rescue. In 2012, the European Central Bank (ECB) stepped in with a dramatic promise to do “whatever it takes” to prevent contagion. The EU and the International Monetary Fund bailed out Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus. The largest bailout package, to Greece, topped $300 billion. But with a GDP of nearly $2 trillion, Italy is the bloc’s third-largest economy—there simply aren’t enough funds to bail it out. There are also concerns that the ECB used up all its firepower fighting the last crisis and has few tools left to make cheap credit available or buy up troubled bonds.

&gt;**What happens next?**

&gt;The EU has several weeks to approve or reject the budget—the latter is a step it has never taken. Brussels could eventually impose fines and other sanctions if Rome refuses to change course.

&gt;Eyes are now on how markets will react. Bond yields have not yet approached the levels they did in 2012, when the ECB hit the panic button. But Italy’s growing fiscal imbalances may soon lead ratings agencies to downgrade its creditworthiness, which could push yields up further and make debt payments still more expensive.

&gt;The Italian government insists that these concerns are overblown and defends its right to make its own decisions. But with Euroskeptics across Europe ramping up efforts for next year’s European Parliament elections, Rome may be itching for a fight with Brussels—a showdown with unpredictable economic consequences.",,/r/europe/comments/9q37ut/does_italy_threaten_a_new_european_debt_crisis/e86939g/,NeoSupaZupa,1540125997

5663," Egyptomania gripped Rome in the wake of the conquest of Egypt in 30 BC.  Both massive original artifacts and inspired copies cropped up all over  the city, but only two actual pyramids were known to have been built,  and only one remains. 

The Pyramid of Cestius was most likely built between 18 and 12 BC. The  36 meter (about 120 feet) high pyramid was built as a tomb for a  wealthy Roman under the sway of all things Egyptian. Little is known  about the man who may have once been buried here, since the tomb was  long ago ransacked and the land around it has changed dramatically over  the centuries. Now at the edge of a busy traffic intersection near a  major train stop, originally the pyramid was well outside of the center  of the city, surrounded by stately columns and two bronze figures (now  in the Musei Capitolini).

The pyramid rises at a much sharper angle than the famous pyramids in  Egypt. This may have been due to incorrect information on the Egyptian  front, innovation on the part of the Roman builders who, using concrete  as a building material, were able to more steeply, or they may have been  inspired by the steeper Nubian pyramids near Jebel Barkal, now in  Sudan. In any event, the unusual proportions of this pyramid close to  home has been credited as the source of oddly proportioned pyramids in  European art supposedly depicting the Egyptian originals.

During this craze for all things Egyptian the famous obelisks began  to appear in the city. Two of them dating from this period still stand -  one in the Piazza del Popolo, and the second in the Piazza di  Montecitorio (though neither one stands in its original location). In  addition to obelisks and other Egyptian imports there was actually  another, larger pyramid in Rome, known as the “Pyramid of Romulus” near  the Castel Sant’Angelo. This pyramid did not survive the building crazes  of later generations, and its marble was used in the building of the  stairs at St. Peter’s Basilica.

The Pyramid of Cestius is constructed of brick and cement, covered in  white marble. Originally the interior of his tomb was decorated with  lively frescoes, described in detail by early travelers, but now mostly  gone. Between 271 and 275 it was built into the fortifications of the  Aurelian walls, which likely helped it survive the centuries.

The inscription on the southeast side of the pyramid reads: “Gaius  Cestius Epulo, son of Lucius, of the Poblilian district, praetor,  tribune of the people, official of the public banquets. According to his  will, this work was completed in three hundred and thirty days; it was  executed by his heirs L. Pontus Mela, son of Publius, of the Claudian  district, and his freedman Pothus”

By the middle ages, stories about the two pyramids named them as the  tombs of the legendary founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus. The actual  tomb and inscriptions were not (re)discovered until tunnel builders  found it in the 1600s. It was restored first in the 1600s, later in  1999, and again in 2015. It is the only pyramid of its kind in Europe.  Today the tomb can only be accessed by special permission.

For a view of the pyramid with less traffic, go inside the Aurelian walls to the Protestant Cemetery to the northwest side.

They absolutely would, and absolutely should have continued to campaign for it. Because that's what fucking democracy is.

Apparently there is around 100 Czechs any given time in Singapore, quite bit of bartenders scattered around.

haha, that's a lot of questions

* Your  very own MoM called me if I want to work here, I work in cybersecurity  and there is not enough of us, so they hunt us like deers in season.  They did not offer me any jobs directly, just pointed me to few portals  with companies looking for expats.
* I  know Anglo-sphere culture from usual popular western entertainment  production and the Internet, so in that regard, there was not much  surprise, also been a little weeb in my teens and been in Japan before,  so I am familiar with some Eastern Asian stuff which is apparently  popular around here, like anime or Korean dramas and of course kpop.  That being said, lot of small daily things are different around here and  even after few years I am still surprised here and there by some small  stuff.
* First  thing that really struck me when I first landed was how is everyone  here glued to their god damned phones. I am mean, people watching dramas  on their phones when walking in the morning to MRT, really? Next shock  is complete lack of pub/drinking culture. I was expecting immediate cold  one grabs with my new co-workers and nothing happened until official  new-joiner dinner with boss. I understand it is expensive as hell to go  out around here, but still. I am used to go multiple times a week to  just unwind over a couple beers, eat something and go home. In Singapore  people just go out and eat then go home play games or something, nobody  follows eating meeting with drinks, I miss that a lot. Additionally to  that, when people go drink here, they go to get shitfaced instead of  building up a nice tipsiness and trying to maintain it.
* Longer  I am from home, more I am convinced my country is the best country, it  has that nice crossover of being developed and connected with the world  enough while still being laid back, relaxed, somewhat rural and people  still value having a good life doing what they enjoy, instead of chasing  degrees and monies and higher positions at known big companies. I  really struggle to hit common ground with some people here because I  just don't chase career/wealth and I am the weird one around here with  that kind of attitude.
* I  just came back from visiting home after almost two years, so I am not  homesick at the moment, but was quite a lot before I went, was really  looking forward to see all my family and buddies, since I moved to  Singapore on my own.
* I can barely speak Czech and English lol, I am terrible at languages, can say ""ni hao"" and ""xie xie""
* Singapore  has the best god damn food on the planet Earth, I mean it is national  sport to eat well around here, while I do love few Czech signature  dishes I can't get here (can cook them though, so no real problem),  Singapore is steamrolling even Japan when it comes to food.
* Honestly  lot of people around here has no clue what Czech Republic is and where  it on the map, funnily they know Prague way more often, my own boss here  though Prague is a country and never heard of Czech Republic before.  Can't blame them though, I didn't know anything about Singapore and  where it is on the map before I got that call MoM either

Hope  you got your answers, feel free to hit me up in messages, if you have  more, or we can grab a drink or laksa or something eventually. I still  don't know that many people around here, so any new buds are always  welcome for causal hangouts.",living in Singapore,/r/europe/comments/9pxof8/znojmo_czechia_my_hometown/e8696i5/,n4775u,1540126120

It appears there's a long and uphill battle ahead of us, sadly.

&gt; Its just differences in language.

This is such bullshit claim I actually find it insulting. 

First, by that narrative those Polish death camps, called Polish, because they happened to be located in Poland, were operated by Polish crew (because location), the prisoners were transported by Polish trains (because location) and exterminated due to Polish orders (because location). Clinging to the fairy tale that ""it's just how German language works, bro"" is ridiculous. It's comparable to Russians claiming Soviet troops were ""liberators"", because they freed CEE nations from Nazi occupation. Technically it is not false, but we all know it is hardcore manipulation. So is using the ""Polish death camps"" phrase.

Second, if we leave the phrase uncontested, it will spread like cancer among those, for whom German atrocities in Poland is hazy detail of increasingly ancient history - so for people outside Europe and North America. Someone, for whom both Germany and Poland are distant countries, will take the phrase at face value. Eventually we will reach the point, where it will be a TIL moment for people, to hear Poland actually was NOT running the death camps. We absolutely can't allow that to happen.

So yeah, good luck with trying to dismiss the issue. ",Holy Cross (Poland),/r/europe/comments/9pulcf/protest_as_german_daily_refers_to_polish_death/e869a81/,miauracjusz,1540126264

-Breitbart, 2015

&gt;[Former editor-at-large Ben Shapiro wrote that under Bannon's leadership, ""Breitbart has become the alt-right go-to website ... pushing white ethno-nationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness, and the comment section turning into a cesspool for white supremacist mememakers"", describing the website as ""Trump Pravda"". (...) According to BuzzFeed, ""These new emails and documents ... clearly show that Breitbart does more than tolerate the most hate-filled, racist voices of the alt-right. It thrives on them, fuelling and being fuelled by some of the most toxic beliefs on the political spectrum—and clearing the way for them to enter the American mainstream."" In 2017 the Mueller investigation examined the role of Breitbart News in Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and its role in both amplifying stories from Russian media and being amplified by Russian bots in social media. In 2017, a Breitbart News reporter left the company to join Sputnik.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News#Accuracy_and_ideology)

5726,"Ok, so you do not want to say that Spain is not a democracy yet you claim that Spain is ""shitting against a minority"", this minority being, I take it, the Catalans.

That is a very comfortable position for you, because the only counter-argument for someone that does not believe that Spain is ""shitting"" against any minority is to point out to all the democratic mechanisms of the Spanish state that guarantee that the rights of all minorities are preserved. Your strategy is, when confronted to those arguments to say ""hey, I never said Spain was not a democracy"". That is a nice sophism you have there, but I do not buy it.

Like I said before, the strategy of secessionists is to flood the conversation with all kind of claims of abuse by the Spanish State. When these arguments are rebutted and shown as baseless (as was the case when the German court rejected the claims of political prosecution towards Puigdemont) you fall back to a legalist approach and simply argue that Puigdemont and the Catalan leaders have not done anything illegal. To that I can only answer that all the Catalan leaders will have a fair trial, and the court will decide, eventually, whether they are guilty of the charges or not.

Politically, there is nothing in the Spanish law that prevents Catalan parties to advocate for secession, but that will not be possible to realize until there is a Constitutional reform. You should stop playing dirty games and focus your efforts towards that goal.

Like cars having start-stop system which is consequence of car emission regulations. Which saves small amount of gas but damages car-battery. So the emissions are shifted from the car to the manufacturing where EU doesnt care about it as much...

One thing might be that EU doesnt presents itself as it should. I was trying to find what is EU doing about plastic garbage in seas and oceans I have found some programs but I couldnt find much.

When I was trying to find EU parliaments voting in easily digestable form (filter by country, party, politician name, see statistics...) I had to use stupid 3rd party website that let me see one stat and then blocking me until I do something specific.

The threshold for any referrenda should be 50% +1.

Say the question was ""Should Britain leave the EU” with a requirement of %66.66 to pass.

And lets say the result was
40% remain.
60% leave.

In that hypothetical situation, those wanting to remain have won, despite doing barely anything.

The 60% of people wanting change have been trumped.

Obviously any referendum involves a question that boils down to.
-Keep the status quo
-Change the status quo

So if you introduce a 2/3 requirement to pass then that is bias towards maintaining the status quo.
