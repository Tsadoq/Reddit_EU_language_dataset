19,"\&gt; \*The nuclear phase-out had been part of the red/green coalition's manifesto right from the beginning, that's why they went ahead fairly quickly with its implementation.

Now here's the part about the *original* plan (from 2000/2002) that only few people in here seem to be aware of:

* Phase out nuclear power *until* 2030.
* Phase out coal *before* 2030.
* Invest in renewables (through surcharges and taxes on power) to make up for the power generation differential and phase out nuclear and coal on a step-by-step basis: Once certain thresholds of renewable power generation are reached, switch off a group of plants; and the next one, when the next milestone is reached, etc.\*

&amp;#x200B;

See now that actually seems quite reasonable. I mean, personally i would've still kept nuclear as part of the mix, but closed older plants in favor of newer ones. My understanding is that new plants essentially fail into a ""passive state"", where there is no risk of meltdowns. Granted i'm sure this technology is expensive, and i'm not a nuclear scientist so i could be misunderstanding what they mean, but it appears to me that new reactors are going to be the key to getting rid of electricity generated with fossil fuels. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;\* The thing that annoys me the most is that people love to dish out on the Greens because of that. Think about them what you will, but they've had no hand in any of it since 2005.\*

&amp;#x200B;

Haha i love to dish on the Greens personally, even though I've voted for my local Green party in the past. Its kind of like the libertarians for example, where the idea of do no harm and everyone respects everyone's rights and is free to live as they please seems like a great idea, but always tends to attract the fringe looney types that refuse to get a drivers licence. I'm happy that the Greens are playing a bigger role in the European Parliament with this last election, but a bit saddened that its at the expense of the centre-left. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;\* You probably know the old saying ""Germans are the most rational people around - until they aren't"". When they go astray, they really *do* go astray. They've always had a romantic infatuation with forests and greenery, and despite the fact that they were among the first to study radioactivity, its effects have always caused nightmares for some of them. I suspect it's because it plays right into the worst parts of their national psyche if viewed through a certain lense: A strange, invisible force somewhere out there which seaks up on you anytime and from every direction, from which there is no escape, slowly siphoning off your very life energy until you face a gruelling and inevitable end ... That's probably every single thing Germans have ever dreaded since the Thirty Years War folded into one.\*

&amp;#x200B;

That's a great point. I think its something that's not common to just Germans, but is a bit of a wider phenomenon. While i feel that nuclear has great promise, i'm still reticent for the exact same reasons that you mentioned above, mainly the fact that something sinister and unseeable can come down from thin air and poison us. It does sound a bit superstitious when i look at it in written form but its hard to shake that feeling of vulnerability in case of a nuclear catastrophe. And knowing humans, we are fallible, so i cant 100% remove that feeling from my head. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;\* It definitely is. However, one of the upsides of our species is that we can sort these things out in quick order by talking them through. Seems as though you and I are successfully doing that right now, and I like us all the better for it. Particularly because I feel sorry about the fact that I might've come across as brash and abrasive in my first comment up there, which wasn't my intention at all.\*

&amp;#x200B;

Don't worry about it my friend! Reading back my reply it sounds very abrasive as well, it looks like we just got off on the wrong foot! I'm glad it didn't devolve into an argument though as I've learned about a completely new perspective on the German nuclear question. As long as we are willing to keep talking, our differences eventually melt away. It's probably my favorite part of reddit, and the Europe subreddit that i get to talk to other Europeans and see a different point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;\* The thing you have to remember about Germany when it comes to politics is that the German system of governance is consensualistic, not confrontative in nature. Which doesn't mean that everyone is nice all the time, but that nobody and no institution can dominate the process, whose usual result is that nobody gets everything, everybody gets something, everybody can save face and take it from there in the next round, when it's the same all over again.

That's why Germans are so good at navigating the EU. And it's also why they despise Trump more than other Europeans: Because he seems to embody everything they don't want to see in politics.\*

&amp;#x200B;

Yes i quite admire the German ability to keep their politics very moderated. When you look at Germany compared to the rest of Europe, they seem like a veritable paragon of stability. Basically the AfD at around 12% is as bad as it gets. Add Die Linke if you'd like to describe them as populist, and maybe there is around 20% (at most) of the electorate willing to vote for extreme parties. Where goes Germany, there goes the rest of Europe so i'm glad that they're at least a modicum of stability for the rest of us, even though its a common trope in Eastern Europe that ""what Hitler couldn't do with his army, Merkel did with her economy"". 

Its funny how different Donald Trump, with his partial German ethnic background, could be from Merkel in style and temperament. On that note, a part of me is glad he got elected because it appears that everyone is closing ranks in the EU against him, and even people like Macron that tried engaging with him first are more openly speaking against him, or at least some of his actions.",,/r/europe/comments/bx8tah/german_nuclear_power_plant_operators_against/eqcb4a0/,EuroDemos,1559965579

The Scandinavian (or European) approach is to lock people who did a crime away to teach them how to be a functional member of society again. This works well, but is often seen as ""unfair"" by the general population, who wants those that brought suffering to them to suffer for their wrongdoings.

The other philosophy is to have prisons as a deterrent. If your stay is harsh and terrible, it will scare you from ever doing anything illegal again, since you don't ever want to go back there. These harsh prisons are popular by the general population, since they impose the idea of eye for an eye type of justice, however they work really badly for reducing crime and rehabilitation.",,/r/europe/comments/by087y/a_prison_cell_in_the_newly_built_storstrøm_prison/eqbyjm9/,kalesaji,1559958993

173,"&gt;It doesn't matter what you call it, it's also the risk. The open field is not something we should be experimenting with.

Then you stifle research into GMOs but promote research that is more random like mutagenesis and hybridizing. We know more about what we've done to GMO plants than any other technique, yet because of irrational and emotional fear we don't get to make crops that may potentially help us in the fight against climate change. Tell me why can't we do field test with GMO's and can do field tests with hybridization? The answer will likely be superficial and insipid, something along the lines of either putting frog genes in tomatoes isn't the same as taller wheat. Or if I'm lucky you'll hide your scientific ignorance and also just fear monger and say "" GMO is much more powerful then these methods and we don't know the long term consequences"". Your songs has been attacked and debunked by an army of research and science, yet you keep singing it.

&gt;GM fans keep bringing up this straw man. Nobody said that they would. The risks of GMO are first and foremost ecological disruption, to a much lesser extent creating harmful food, but we test pretty extensively for that. But we can't do that for ecological problems.

Yes they did, in fact if you ask consumers if GMO are as healthy for you as non GMO they say no. And on the environment if you just watched the hearing the address the over 2000 studies that pertain to both the environment and human health. There is no inherent reason to ban testing of all GMOs because of environmental concern, scrutinize the ones that interact with the environment like BT and HT ( which they did and found net environmental benefit) but obviously don't scrutinize to the same level a tomatoe that produces anti oxidants. Judge by the specific trait not the fact that they are GMO but what is the GMO doing.

&gt;Surgery isn't inherently harmful either, but that doesn't mean it should be legal to experiment with random surgery experiments on people.

It's not and neither is GMO. But in the EU today I can pour chemicals and radiation into a plant without testing it at all and if I have a good trait I can not only sell it on market, I can label it as organic. The EU policy on GMO's is discriminatory and is not grounded on any logical principal. 

&gt;DNA mutations can propagate and multiply, unlike eg. chemical pollution, that can accumulate in some cases but that's all. We should not experiment with the entire ecology. Find a way to test specific GMOs in more controlled conditions.

Guess what, there DNA mutations in the non GMO plants you're eating right now, there are DNA mutations in your own body. Yes it is exactly the same as putting frog genes in a tomato because viruses have put genes in you. There is no inherent harm in GMOs over a non GMO product, hence no need for special mandatory regulation. If you want to regulate all crops this way then fine. But singling out GMOs has no merit.


&gt;Or, you know, just concentrate on the millions of applications of GM in controlled environments like growing organs or using bacteria for industrial processes.

Or try to help people with serious food shortages who's crops are being destroyed by blight. Or harden on crops for incoming changes in climate that will frustrate agriculture. The uses of GMOs are many and there is no inherent danger in putting a non GMO crop in the environment vs a GMO one. This is stated by every significant national academy and science org in the world. Including the ones answering ecological questions. The case against GMOs is unfounded and irrational. Please watch the NRC hearing or read the publication of any scientific regulatory body, if you want non company funded papers then look for those. The conclusion is the same, GMO foods are as safe for the environment and health of humans as any other technique. They arguably provide more environmental benefit by replacing dangerous pesticides with more benign alternatives.

&gt;There is no intrinsic risk with using cars, medicine, even fire but that does not contradict we have clear and strong restrictions on where and how to use them.

Yet we don't have restrictions on plants that are much more uncertain in their safety to both the public and the environment.

Now you are the one basing your opinion on a controversial subject on only one article (or at least only one you cited) but wait... there's more like I said the original economist David card actually found no evidence for decreased wages and others have backed him up on that.

&gt;How can businesses have cheap labour without lowering the wages for native workers?

Well easy the immigrants are the cheap labour and because there are more people now the old workers can work as managers for example.
Or because there is more demand for products now, new businesses can open up and employ the displaced workers. 
There are dozens of ways that can happen and it is not at all paradoxical because economies are dynamic

&gt;We can't just retrain 60 year olds for new jobs 

That is right but a lot of people aren't 60 years old and can be retrained and for the people who can't we have welfare

&gt;Cheaper products benefit the middle and upper class and the poor will just be hurt

That is just wrong poor people benefit the most from cheaper products because they have to spend most of their income on food, gas,....

Do you want to literally pay them less? In my country it's illegal to one group of people less. 

And no, if you think that magically every worker is going to promoted to a management position...you just clearly have absolutely no fucking idea what you're talking about. 

&gt;Or because there is more demand for products now, new businesses can open up and employ the displaced workers.

Automation is increasing productivity. That means less workers are needed to produce goods.

371,"Khrushchev: 

&gt;Nikita Khrushchev, having served as a military commissar and intermediary between Stalin and his generals during the war, addressed directly the significance of Lend-lease aid in his memoirs:

&gt;I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin's views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were ""discussing freely"" among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.[41]

Zhukov:

&gt;""""Now they say that the allies never helped us, but it can't be denied that the Americans gave us so many goods without which we wouldn't have been able to form our reserves and continue the war,"" Soviet General Georgy Zhukov said after the end of WWII.

&gt;""We didn’t have explosives, gunpowder. We didn’t have anything to charge our rifle cartridges with. The Americans really saved us with their gunpowder and explosives. And how much sheet steel they gave us! How could we have produced our tanks without American steel? But now they make it seem as if we had an abundance of all that. Without American trucks we wouldn’t have had anything to pull our artillery with.""

More about Stalin: 

&gt;According to the Russian historian Boris Vadimovich Sokolov, Lend-Lease had a crucial role in winning the war:

&gt;On the whole the following conclusion can be drawn: that without these Western shipments under Lend-Lease the Soviet Union not only would not have been able to win the Great Patriotic War, it would not have been able even to oppose the German invaders, since it could not itself produce sufficient quantities of arms and military equipment or adequate supplies of fuel and ammunition. The Soviet authorities were well aware of this dependency on Lend-Lease. Thus, Stalin told Harry Hopkins [FDR's emissary to Moscow in July 1941] that the U.S.S.R. could not match Germany's might as an occupier of Europe and its resources.[32]

378,"Correct answare is both, yes and no.

There are many types of guns and many types of 'gun owner law'. There are 5 types of guns.

- Black power gun before 1845 (I don't remember year, but there are few rewolwers that work quite good) - witchout any permission

- gun for safty reasons - this is hard to get, but if you have you can walk on street with gun &amp; ammo loaded

- gun for collections / historical period / museum - quite hard, but avaible if you really like this (you can't walk on street with loaded gun)

- hunters - you need to be in 'hunters broterhood', be part of broterhood', go for hunting with your pals, etc.

- sport - it's about 6 month course + 2 egzams (teory + practise). It's similar to driving licence. You need to be part of 'sport club' and take part in at least 2 sport competitions / year for each type od weapon that you have (pistols/rifles/shotgun). You don't have right to walk on street with fully loaded gun (but you can have ammo somewhere else) 

As you see, it depends. Easiest way is to have sport permission. Then you can bought any type od weapon that have single fire mode (even sniper rifles or assult rifles with single shot regulation).",Poland,/r/europe/comments/bxtd8n/school_shootings_in_europe_since_1988/eqb1wkl/,zchpit,1559943724

382,"&gt;Or just go ahead and explain it..

Okay, let's try getting through this together: 

Let's go step by step.

&gt; ""Close your eyes and think of all the oligarch money"",

I was making a witty referencing a supposed anecdote from the Victorian period: 

https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/close_one%27s_eyes_and_think_of_England

So basically, it means you should let yourself be fucked for a higher cause. In this case, the cause is all the Russian money that is poured into London. 

Get it yet? 

Moving on: 

&gt;Radioactive materials, chemical weapons on British soil

The Russians used radioactive material and chemical weapons in assassinations in Britain.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexander_Litvinenko

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Sergei_and_Yulia_Skripal

&gt;one wonders if there's anything the Brits won't take lying down.

So how serious is this? Well, let's say that the Russians used two of four kinds of weapons that are classified as weapons of mass destruction on British soil. 

What was the British response to this? Could it be characterized as doing almost nothing (taking it lying down? ) considering how serious this is?

445,"But that's a really tough question to ask. Sure, the Soviet Union bore the brunt of the war effort for many years, but they would not have succeeded without the presence of the other warring countries. 

The Soviets were reliant on American and British aid in order to supply part of their army. When the Allies invaded Sicily and Italy, the Germans had to send some of their most elite troops there in order to prevent them from just walking into Rome. This, in turn, relieved the pressure on the eastern front for the Soviets. You also shouldn't discount the effects of the strategic bombing campaign conducted by the British and Americans on German industry and civilian morale.

491,"&gt; Which one?

The edit where you felt that mentioning the prevalence of African immigrants engaging in illegal activity aided in demonstrating that a comment on the higher level of illegal activity among immigrants was “disingenuous and misleading”.

&gt; But the question must remain why, generally, the proportion of people helped must always remain constant and small while the nature of the issue goes completely against such a concept 

Immigration is fundamentally a process intended to benefit the State; it includes elements of humanitarianism, it does not centre around humanitarianism. An immigration process focused on humanitarianism would disadvantage the State significantly. 

&gt; I never claimed so. 

In other words, the point raised with respect to America was tangentially related, reflecting little with respect to the present question, that of immigration in Germany. 

&gt; Germany and other countries faced with demographic changes have spent billions upon billions in incentives for decades without hiking the birth rates over sustainment levels. It's a pipe dream unless you have more than pious hopes on how to change that.

Source? 

&gt; And actually, even if that were the case, the effects would be only noticeable in twenty to thirty years and workers are needed now

This is not an argument against policy designed to increase the native population, plenty of Governmental projects are initiated with the understanding that the positive impact will not immediately be felt; climate change policy, for example.

&gt; Third, even if your demographic engineering works, someone from Ukraine or Ecuador will still be more willing to work in low-income by far if you don't suggest to deliberately worsen German citizens living standards and expectations of quality of life.

Presumably, yes. However, assuming a self-sustaining native population, the necessity for immigrants to fill low-skilled employment positions would decrease. 

&gt; Fourth, it's low-income. It isn't or shouldn't be low-skilled, especially in elderly care.

It is generally classified as low-skilled, you’ve an issue with the classification itself, that’s fine.",,/r/europe/comments/bxv42s/germanys_crime_rate_fell_to_lowest_level_in/eqansc2/,newcount22,1559936504

If the first generation arrived in 1970 (Wervingsverdragen in late 60s by CDA+VVD), got their first kid in 1980 (family reunification policy late 70s by CDA+VVD), who got their first kid in 2000 and then their first kid in 2020, that means the fourth generation just doesn't exist yet. Most of the second generation is only now getting children. We can't say anything about the third generation till there's a noticeable amount (say, 10 thousand) that's over 15 years old - right now it's only 2 thousand, or 0,5% of the total population with a Turkish background in the Netherlands.

Brno before WW2 can be considered multicultural because Germans and Czechs were to a degree separate/parallel cultures, mainly because of their languages.

There's a finite amount of leverage available there.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Pass_rare_earth_mine

&gt; The Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine is an open-pit mine of rare-earth elements on the south flank of the Clark Mountain Range, just north of the unincorporated community of Mountain Pass, California, United States. The mine once supplied most of the world's rare-earth elements.

-

&gt; In 1998, the mine's separation plant ceased production of refined rare earth compounds; it continued to produce bastnäsite concentrate[7].
&gt;
&gt; The mine closed in 2002, though processing of previously mined ore continued, in response to both environmental restrictions and competition from Chinese suppliers.[8]
-

&gt;In 2008, remaining reserves using a 5% cutoff grade were estimated to exceed 20 million tons of ore that averages 8.9% rare-earth oxides.[5]

-

&gt;The House Committee on Science and Technology scheduled on September 23, 2010, the review of a detailed bill to subsidize the revival of the American rare-earths industry, including the reopening of the Mountain Pass mine.[18]
&gt;
&gt; As a result of the US-China trade war, MP Materials has said it will start its own processing operation in the United States by 2020, after China doubled import duties on concentrates to 25%.[19] According to Bloomberg, ""China Has a Rare Earths Plan Ready to Go if Trade War Deepens""[20].

https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/05/australian-rare-earth-ore-processor-wants-to-build-a-plant-in-the-us/

&gt; This week, two rare-earth mineral-processing companies announced a new joint-venture whose aim will be to establish a rare-earth ore processing plant in Hondo, Texas.

-

&gt; Currently, the only rare-earths mine in the US is in Mountain Pass, Calif. But Trump administration tariffs, designed to protect US miners from competition with cheap Chinese raw materials, have actually been hurting Mountain Pass because its primary ore processing plants are in China. Mountain Pass must ship its ore to China to be processed, opening it up to retaliatory Chinese tariffs. According to the The Wall Street Journal, Mountain Pass currently pays a 10 percent tariff on rare-earth ore shipments to China, and on June 1, that's set to increase to 25 percent.

-

&gt; If the Hondo plant does move forward, the companies expect that it would ""become the lone major producer of separated medium and heavy rare-earth products outside of China.""",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/bxjyx7/russias_sechin_accuses_us_of_using_energy_as/eq9zgc6/,vokegaf,1559921571

Still, I'm going to go against the other comments here and say that people with substantial criminal cases against themselves from another country should face trial in that country, regardless of nationality.

The complication here is that China isn't above falsifying accusations, and doesn't have a trustworthy justice system. The first I doubt is the case here. The second is the issue.

Slightly different ? Every single family has a slightly different culture. Some might have dinner at 9pm, some at 6pm.

Every town has a different use of a language. Every village. 

That's why when any sane person defines culture it doesn't make a new culture for every slight difference. 

We look at the culture of all the people that are ethnically czech for example, and get the median from that. And then we do the same for slovaks, and saw that they're basically identical. Meaning they share the same culture

&gt;You're using arbitrary language that suits your agenda, black and white, no wiggle room, and that's what makes you wrong.

You didn't tell me anything about his cultural preferences though. Saying ""has czech friends but hangs out a lot with Vietnamese family"" is like ""I'm not a racist, I have one black friend, I can't be"". Having friends from somewhere else is not culture at all.

We are talking about 1500 and this was already the period when state documents were written in Ruthenian (or some equivalent of it; like Ruthenian written in Arabic script) - even before official adoption of it as such.

This is the time when state officials were not expected to *speak* Lithuanian (there was a recorded case of someone trying to speak in Lithuanian to hide the content of discussion from state official who arrived from Vilnius; IIRC it was 1520s).

There is a very solid case for saying that Lithuania has even less rights to the name of Lithuania than Macedonia.

&gt; In the end, they were all subjects of a lithuanian ruler

That's a far cry from ""nobility spoke in Lithuanian"".

&gt;But if they‘d be dictating foreign policy than I‘d be worried, because while I agree with more defensive policies and a reduction of US influence in Europe, I‘d rather have the EU take that position like Macron has asked for.

I mean, it's not like the Bundeswehr is an aggressive army in the first place; only remotely aggressive interventions they were involved are IIRC in Kosovo and Afghanistan? Former one was legally dodgy, but I'll awlays not that it was with the intent to avoid another Bosnia massacre/genocide. And in Afghanistan IIRC the german army only offered material help in the original invasion, it basically only went there as a security force (around 2005 it became more of a combat mission). Oh right, and Syria; but ISIS had a state that literally went to slaughter civilians in Germany, so yeah, sending a pitiful amount of jets there that was still a defensive reaction. 

So with that in mind, it's not like there is much to change, at least for me. Only real issues is the equipment and personal situation.

[Russian girls were legally allowed to be sold in Novgorod to Tatars from Kazan in the 1600s by Russian law. Germans, Poles, and Lithuanians were allowed to be sold to Crimean Tatars in Moscow. In 1665 Tatars were allowed to buy from the Russians, Polish and Lithuanian slaves. Before 1649 Russians could be sold to Muslims under Russian law in Moscow.](https://www.academia.edu/2971600/Slave_Trade_in_the_Early_Modern_Crimea_From_the_Perspective_of_Christian_Muslim_and_Jewish_Sources) So yes, Russians *did* partake in the trade, and they didn't just sell either. They used slaves extensively for themselves.
Russia then went on to ""abolish"" slavery in 1723, which just meant that slaves were turned into *serfs,* which was the **exact same thing** since they had no real rights and could be bought and sold freely by their masters. And Russian serfdom was among the most brutal through all of Europe, and serfdom was not abolished until *1861.* So congratulations, Russia at least beat the US, though at no point did slaves make up the *majority* of the entire population there like they did in Russia.

Six media companies dominate all of US media - entanglement with US media corporations and the government has been proven time and time again since Operation Mockingbird.

What convenient coincidences.

1043,"This is an Austro-Hungarian military graveyard from 1916. 1100+ soldiers are buried here, of which 730+ are Hungarian and 11 are Romanians.

The cemetery is a pilgrimage site for local Hungarians who wish to pay their respects, and it's protected by a pact signed by the Hungarian and the Romanian governments.

Few weeks ago the cemetery was annexed unlawfully from Hargitha county (Hungarian majority) by the neighbouring Bacau county (Romanian majority), violating the law at 6 points.

They've started by installing dozens of Orthodox Romanian crosses, many of them on Hungarian graves because fuck the dead in particular. 

Following that, civil activists from the nearby Hungarian majority counties pulled bags on these crosses in defiance - after which the Romanian media picked up the story saying that ""these evil Hungarians are desecrating Romanian graves!"".

A bunch of vandals threatened to assault the cemetery, to which the Hungarian community responded by forming a human chain in front of the entrance to prevent further desecration.

Romanians then started assaulting the peaceful civillians with rocks and flagpoles, shouting at them to ""run back to Budapest!"" (these Hungarians live closer to the cemetery than the Romanians who came here but ok).

They eventually broke through the chain, knocked off the crosses of multiple graves, planted Romanian flags on them. 

After all this the Romanian government has the nerve to tell Budapest to ""calm down the Hungarians"" and paint them as victims. Fucking degenerates.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/bxqwga/romanian_nazis_break_in_to_a_hungarian_military/eq98dyp/,Raknel,1559892964

1171,"

&gt; 55-year-old Dariusz Piontkowski is a historian at the Faculty of Humanities of the Białystok branch of the University of Warsaw (currently an independent university - the University of Białystok). He completed post-graduate studies in human resources management in public administration and education management. For many years he worked as a teacher in the Białystok I General Secondary School. He taught history and WOS. Graduates of this school say about him that he was a demanding teacher.

&gt; After President Kaczyński anointed Piontkowski as the plenipotentiary of the Law and Justice party in Podlasie, he started to be invited more and more often as a discussion partner to the public media. He willingly took up almost every subject. On March 18, on TVP Białystok, on the sidelines of the discussion that took place in the studio about the LGBT + declaration signed by the President of Warsaw in February, he announced: ""What the PO and Nowoczesna are trying to do in Warsaw, but also in other large cities, is to try to sexualize children forcibly according to the leftist standards that have been introduced in some Western European countries. After all, the sexualisation of children from the age of two or three should lead to what? In fact, it is an attempt to bring up children who will be handed over to paedophiles at some point. Unfortunately, the slogan of adopting children by homosexual couples is heading in the same direction. It aims at raising some children in non-standard sexual behaviours [...]. These programmes [concerning the upbringing of children - ed.] applied in Western Europe, England or Scandinavia have led to many tragedies and to the brutalisation of this type of behaviour.""""

&gt; Shortly afterwards, a wave of accusations against him swept through social networks. He was accused of homophobia. In April, on the occasion of the teachers' and other educational workers' strike organized by the Polish Teachers' Union, Piontkowski announced in ""Minęła 8"" TVP Info in the programme ""Miniła 8"": ""Today's ZNP is in fact a post-communist organization that took over the name [about the pre-war ZNP, which has been operating under this name since 1930 - ed.] and in fact has little to do with that union, just like many other organizations that the communists once appropriated.""",,/r/europe/comments/bxr4sm/polands_new_education_minister_warsaw_lgbt/eq95b6q/,c12xp,1559886852

1225,"&gt; What you're missing is that Srebrenica was a crime conducted by Mladic, not Milosevic. In fact, Milosevic was very much in conflict with Mladic and had little control over him. I hate the guy, he ruined the best years of my life, but we should not oversimplify his role in the Bosnian wars. Also, the Bosnian conflict should not be condensed into Srebrenica alone; years of hunger, disintegration, sieges and death have plagued that region as well. While it is a great tragedy and a tipping point, let's not use it as the sole reference to the overall conflict. Tens of thousands of people have died elsewhere in Bosnia.

Ratko Mladić is definitely a terrible war criminal. I don't know enough about the power struggles in the Yugoslav/Serbian government at the time.

&gt; YOU. ELECTED. TRUMP.

I have the hardest time with Serbs for some reason who seem completely unable to 1.) stop with whataboutism and 2.) who can't admit that there is something wrong with their own nation. I don't have this problem. As evidenced above, it's not terribly difficult to focus on one thing at a time and to also admit that the place where I was born has problems. Maybe someday you'll get there, too. As to a way to get there, as I suggested, a truth and reconciliation committee would probably be a good start and meeting EU standards would likely also be good.

&gt; Furthermore, Milosevic was a dictator who rigged the polls on the regular. He tried to do so in 2000 as well, but he failed as he underestimated the overall turn out.

Thank you and I am a cunt by most definitions, I act like a cunt but i  think I phrased my words badly, subjectively and opinionated in this instance and I apologise for that. I always try to work by facts and my first comment was opinion and emotional.

&gt;I’m really not going to change your mind about anything, 

If you have evidence to suggest anything I said was wrong, I'll change my mind about it. But I'm not going to change my opinion over things like the War on Terror.

&gt;Its part of being a good citizen instead if some nihilistic criclejerking jagoff.

Being a good citizen is acknowledging war crimes, and injustices against your fellow citizens and educating others that they are happening and holding your government accountable. It's about believing you can change things for the better. Taking action. That's the opposite of nihilism no? You don't have to feel guilty for them. It's not you that's responsible. (Hopefully)

&gt;Trump lost the popular vote in an election only like 45% of our population even voted in. Most of us never wanted him to be president in the first place. To white wash all of us together as these fox news boomer retards is just flat ignorant.

I want to emphasise this. I never mentioned Trump once during all my comments. You can check them. I specifically did say though that the issues weren't relegated to Republicans. One of the things that greatly annoys me is the ""TAN SUIT"" meme that people post about obama. As if that was his only controversy. They forget the drones, Guantanamo, expansion of the police state and intelligence services, bailing out the banks, and a few other things. Overall he was one of the better presidents. But a product of how far the overton window has shifted to the right. He even said so himself. ""A few decades ago I would have been a moderate Republican."" 

This is a multi -faceted issue that's been brewing for 70 years. And to some degree even longer with things like the reconstruction era being cut short and groups such as United Daughters of Confederacy been given legitimacy to spread propaganda throughout the south as Well as a hundred other things unique to the US that has guided Domestic and Foreign policy... in the wrong direction. But they can be fixed.  

&gt;Keep in mind that the US government developed the same internet you're using to communicate with me, and maybe dial it back

This is the thing. Governments aren't like people. If the US government was a person it would be a case of weighing up their positives versus negatives and coming out with a final opinion of them. But it's not quite like that. All the contributions to science that have happened under the US doesn't change my moral compass or my opinion on things like the public officials who feel comfortable openly admitting to murdering hundreds of civilians, or police blacksites, or a million other things. You have to criticise the wrong. 

Now admittedly any foreign person would be an absolute bastard to nitpick over every single mistake the US government were doing if things were going swimmingly. Or even to bring up irrelevant things from decades ago to criticise. But the fact is the world, and the American people themselves are currently suffering in large ways due to decisions made in Washington.",Leinster (Ireland),/r/europe/comments/bxe58t/poll_in_france_which_country_contributed_the_most/eq8yf56/,AbjectStress,1559879262

1397,"I mean, I guess I respect your tenacity to keep on making up stuff and imputing on me but it's definitely exhausting and makes me question if you're even reading what I wrote.

&gt;     Sounds good. I never justified NATO intervention (which was internationally legal in 1995)—I'm a pacifist. All I did was ask you to justify a claim you made. Your weird hang-ups about how the world is conspiring against the Slavs are your problem, not mine.

&gt; There was no international intervention against FR Yugoslavia in 1995. FR Yugoslavia was no legally or otherwise involved in war in Bosnia. Yugoslav army left Bosnia before the war began.

I never said that FR Yugoslavia was involved in 1995.

&gt; You must have missed the entire paragraph about NATO still having troops and bases there and being the only army to do so. And doing it illegally, since Kosovo can not give you permission, since it's not in the UN, and half the UN doesn't recognize it. The permission you obtained from Serbia was obtained using force, illegally against the security council.

You say this, even tho [UNMIK has troops there](https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/mission/unmik). I'm not sure why you think that only NATO does, since that's obviously untrue. No one is legally obliged to be in the UN or have recognition from the UN, so that's an irrelevant distraction. Your claim that Serbia's acquiescence ""against"" the Security Council is also baseless: please show me a citation that the Security Council opposed Serbia allowing NATO into Kosovo.

&gt; You made it a point. You said they wanted to ""prevent another srebrenica"" . Except there is no evidence of anything like that happening. In fact number of ""crimes"" only rose AFTER nato started it's campaign. Who'd have guessed that ?

Yes, that was their rationale. Again, I'm not going to debate the validity of their rationale, I'm just stating it.

&gt; And how many of them were created by the USA ? or by USA bombing ?

How many sovereign states were ""created"" by the USA?... Cuba and the Philippines, maybe? The United States certainly did not *create* Egypt, Germany, Korea, or Niger.

&gt; How many of them are protected only be USA without their own army ? How many of them have their foreign policy dictated by the USA ?

Several. Again, not sure what your point is: yes, the Pax Americana provides security in international waters and for small states such as Iceland. I never defended this nor even tried to justify it, so why you're asking me these accusatory questions about Japan's (lack of a) military is perplexing. Foreign policy is dictated by bigger states against smaller states all the time: Iran to Lebanon, Russia to Uzbekistan, the United States to a lot of the Western hemisphere, etc.

&gt;How many of them raise monuments to Bill Clinton and name their children Tonibler ?

One?

&gt; I'll ask instead, how many of them have terrorists as their president/prime minister. Friendly reminder, in the 1990s, USA itself put KLA (of which leaders are in Kosovo government) as a terrorist organization. Now it props up their government, amusing.

There's nothing ""amusing"" about an organized crime syndicate that made itself rich off organ trafficking forming a government.

&gt; At best Kosovo is a protectorate of USA. Incapable of leading their own foreign policy if it conflicts with USA one.

Again, please explain *how*. I'm not asking you to derail about how the United States has committed war crimes. I know we have. I want some details on the topic at hand, please.


&gt; You brought it in. As I said, the reason you gave was ""preventing another Srebrenica"". My retort was, let's prevent another Vietnam too, by bombing USA. Or another Iraq. It's the exact same situation. Why is it okay to ""prevent another srebrenica"" but not to prevent another iraq ?

What is ""it"" in this sentence? Again, please re-read what I wrote.

&gt; If it was a right thing to do which you try to paint it to be, why aren't we all bombing the USA ? They're the most aggressive state in the world.

So let me get this straight, red-green is SPD-Green coalition? So that wouldn’t have been Merkel and the CDU that started the nuclear phase out?? I was definitely not aware how far back the procedure went.
My understanding was it was a knee-jerk reaction to Fukushima, and that generally the public was for it and that’s why they went ahead with it, even though it was pretty clear emissions would go up in the short term.

In either case, why did they begin phasing out nuclear so long ago? Is it because the plants were too old/uneconomic or was it a more general dislike of nuclear?

I think the “force” thing I’m going to have to chalk up to language difference/cultural.

1608,"4th generation reactors are also emerging technology, china is build very first power plant based on 4th generation reactors.

progress may seem slow(and was slowed down by  nuclear fear) but thats because progress of nuclear technology is different from for example solar power progress, instead of making smooth progress its actually happening in leaps, in big leaps, we are currently at gen 3/3+ of reactors and 4 generation would have 100-300 times yield of 3/3+ generation from same amount of fuel.
and scientists are already thinking about 5th generation reactors, like for example:

 - ""Nuclear fusion–fission hybrid"" which is generating power by use of a combination of nuclear fusion and fission processes. The basic idea is to use high-energy fast neutrons from a fusion reactor to trigger fission in otherwise nonfissile fuels like U-238 or Th-232. Each neutron can trigger several fission events, multiplying the energy released by each fusion reaction hundreds of times. This would not only make fusion designs more economical in power terms, but also be able to burn fuels that were not suitable for use in conventional fission plants, even their nuclear waste.

- Fission fragment reactor. A fission fragment reactor is a nuclear reactor that generates electricity by decelerating an ion beam of fission byproducts instead of using nuclear reactions to generate heat. By doing so, it bypasses the Carnot cycle and can achieve efficiencies of up to 90% instead of 40–45% attainable by efficient turbine-driven thermal reactors. The fission fragment ion beam would be passed through a magnetohydrodynamic generator to produce electricity.

1618,"Aye, I'd like to chime in to bring another point of view to the way Dunkirk was seen by some.

&amp;#x200B;

My great-grandfather was an officer in the 2nd World War and fought in Dunkirk. When things started going south and the British started leaving the majority of french troops started swimming to reach the boats, my great-grandfather was one of those swimmers.

He managed to grip onto the ledge of the boat with both hands and like many others screamed for help, the British didn't have enough space and prioritized helping their own troops. They used their weapons to smack the hands of the french away, my great-grandfather got smacked on the head which nearly led to him drowning at sea. 

A good portion of those who didn't make it or were rejected ended up captured by the Germans and brought into camps. Those weren't death camps, mostly facilities used to keep the prisoners grouped up and with menial duties such as peeling potatoes. My great-grandfather being an officer got sent to an officers camp. 

I realize I've talked about why the french weren't always fond of the British up until now, from now on I'll simply be talking about the life of my great-grandfather for those that may be interested.

He spent 4 years in the camp, the thing that got the most to him and other inmates was the boredom. He witnessed escape attempts, the change of attitude of the Germans as time passed. I possess a drawing of him made by an other inmate that I would gladly share with you if I ever find it again.

One thing that shocked him was the arrival of the Russians. The Germans outright hated them and they were treated like scum. They were half dead from the trip and were pushed out with pitchforks which gave place to a few deaths.

Once the camp was liberated he had to walk through half of Germany to reach France and meet his daughter he had never met before.

Those events changed him in some ways, he never played the violin ever again and his view of the English was very intense to say the least. There is an old way of describing the English in France :

""La perfide Albion""

There is a lot to be said about the anglo-french relationship which spans over decades of war and backstabbing but I don't think now is the time to go on about it. My family never let his prejudice get to them as we always had our own view of the world but I very much understand his feelings. 

Me being half french and half Irish doesn't give me the most unbiased point of view concerning the English. I never really shed a tear when I hear the English are struggling and don't have much love for them but I admire aspects of their culture and don't hate them either.

The Americans however are an entirely different beast but that is for another time or comment I think.

I'll post an update when I find the picture of my great-grandfather.",,/r/europe/comments/bxe58t/poll_in_france_which_country_contributed_the_most/eq7mjm9/,Mersaye,1559849445

The US contributed about half of all equipment used by the allies. They started supplying support long before they officially entered the war.

1754,"You don't need to view things in a vacuum to question their morality.

It's very easy to emotionally distance yourself from specific events by going ""but X happened which was worse, so we shouldn't take the intentional deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians seriously"".

The Rape of Nanking is a great example, because it illustrates my exact point here - just from the perspective of the Japanese. If they even acknowledge it, they will severely downplay and rationalize it to protect their own self-image and perception of justice - exactly like the US will do with their own actions in the pacific theatre.  
Regardless of wanting to view things ""in context"", the main purpose of M69 incendiary bombings were to spread panic, deliberately kill civilians, and destroy civilian homes. Which they did - hundreds of thousands of them.

&gt; Now you're just posting your characterizations as if they're fact. 

What do you mean? This particular bombing has been fully documented.

1756,"&gt; Not very far right things, yet the only thing you focus on is immigration for some reason.

I'm talking on immigration positions, not the whole programme (although I'm sure it's not very ambitious as its usual from Third Way Social Dem parties).

&gt;And fixing immigration issues is protecting the working class, since they live in the more affordable neighborhoods that are changed first by immigration (and not always for the better), are the ones suffering lacking wage growth due to more cheap competition coming in and need to pay for the integration and other issues if taxation is not being targeted towards corporations. Fixing immigration also does not mean ""close the border and built a wall"" but actually having sensible policies there.

There's not ""fixing"" immigration as there isn't ""fixing"" healthcare or education, there will always be developments its not a static thing. But coming back to my point making immigration or being openly against refugees is not conducive with a party that supposedly wants to uphold internationalism, human rights and societal solidarity. If we look into class sections we'll find that those who are struggling at a job are at a very considerable % immigrants or out of immigrant backgrounds. As you said we have to focus on the labour aspect which goes hand and hand with my assertion that going the same narrative of the far right only empowers those ideas (a bit like cultural hegemony

&gt;What you do is straight away link any mention of immigration - that you yourself brought up even, not me! - to the far right instead of seeing there might be actual issues for people that a left wing party can tackle just as well without going all extreme nationalist and racist.

Again I'm only about it because I think it's sad and dangerous for a center left party to adopt the same position of a populistic nativist right wing party regarding one of the most vulnerable groups in our societies.

1799,"A simplistic explanation:  
There was a conference of the states (which are parties to the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions - these are environmental conventions) in Genova. They agreed on a bunch of measures (mostly amendments or additions to the existing conventions) and agreed on a ""Partnership on Plastic Wastes"". Some UN body/working group usually makes a draft of terms before the conference and countries debate the draft during these conferences. They can give their opinion, make changes, disagree with certain terms (they make reservations - i. e. express that they don't want a certain term to apply to them) and so on. If the countries come to an agreement at a conference, all of their opinions, changes and reservations need to be integrated and published as a coherent whole which takes some time.

I think that at the moment the only thing available is still just the [draft of terms](http://www.brsmeas.org/2019COPs/MeetingDocuments/tabid/7832/ctl/Download/mid/21618/language/en-US/Default.aspx?id=24&amp;ObjID=21227). A draft [report of the conference](http://www.basel.int/Portals/4/download.aspx?d=UNEP-CHW.14-L.1-Add.1.English.docx) was also published and you can read brief notes about (some) of the debate that was going on regarding the changes to the existing conventions and there's also a mention of the Partnership as well, however, this report is only a draft and also unfinished.

You could read the draft of terms that was written before the conference, but considering that there were probably significant changes to it at the conference itself, it's best to wait for the official version to be published by the UN.

[This article](https://sdg.iisd.org/news/basel-cop-considers-partnership-on-plastic-wastes/) is a nice summary of the Partnership and [this one](https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/governments-agree-landmark-decisions-protect-people-and-planet) explains other measures the states have agreed upon at the conference. This is a [website](http://www.basel.int/) for the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions.

US rarely signs any of the most important international conventions - it loves to avoid any restrictions or responsibility. Just signing also isn't enough for an international agreement to have an effect, a state needs to ratify it as well for it to apply to that state. The most universal agreements are usually open, which means the US could still sign and ratify it in the future (though unlikely).

UN is not ""Europe specific"", btw. It's a global/world organization. The ""United Nations"" or the ""world"" subreddits would probably be more appropriate for this question.",,/r/europe/comments/bxiiua/what_does_the_un_pact_on_plastics_actually_say/eq79jm5/,meowmystery,1559842908

If anything, your 'argument against me' has only further my original point that national identity in Wales doesn't correlate to who voted what in either the Referendum or the EU elections, as I didn't know Anglesey voted Leave but has voted for Plaid Cymru. I guess it got bunched up together for the vote as it's odd that a Leave majority area voted a Remain-favouring party in the later EU elections.

From your own article:

ensions increased because of Germany's support for the Fascist Spanish Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War, while the Soviet Union supported the partially socialist-led Spanish Republic government.[11]

Economic reconciliation was hampered even further by political tension after the Anschluss in mid-1938 and Hitler's increasing hesitance to deal with the Soviet Union.[12] Soviet exports to Germany fell to 47.4 million Reichsmarks in 1937 (approximately one fifth of the 1934 total) and 52.8 million Reichsmarks in 1938.[13] In short, the important trading relationship between the countries that existed in the 1920s essentially collapsed with Hitler's rise to power.[14]

Throughout these years, the bulk of the imports from the Soviet Union consisted of raw materials equivalent to foreign exchange. For example, in 1937, 95 percent of imports to the Soviet Union were raw materials.[15] Germany lacks natural supplies of several key raw materials needed for economic and military operations. In 1938, two thirds of German oil supply came from the United States and Latin America, while 52 per cent of German steel used imported iron ore originating from Sweden[16] Germany's imports by countries (in Million of Reichsmarks) were as follows:

Sometimes you’ll see people sniping at other nations soldiers, implying that their own were “better”. All completely ludicrous. 

We never remember how incredibly close the western alliance was- how effective it was. How both the British and Americans placed their men under the command of foreign leaders. It was an unprecedented how close that alliance was. All the western allies shouldered the burden that they could bear and fought well for the most part. 

We never remember how it was the western allies that destroyed the Luftwaffe. What the eastern front was for the German army the west was for their air force. From the Battle of Britain to the Battle of Germany they inflicted crippling losses on the Germans- allowing for Soviet air dominance in the east. Operation Bagration benefited greatly from that. Allied bombing of petroleum refineries starved Germany of oil and gas. 

The massive Soviet contribution is well-understood and I feel most here are aware of it. Their resistance is one of the great stories of history- but that shouldn’t make us dismiss the efforts of others. The east deserves more attention from us, but it isn’t the whole story.

1933,"&gt; On 10 dead nazis soldiers, 9 were killed by the USSR, 1 by the US.

This is primarily because, compared to the USSR, the US and the UK were more likely to accept surrender - and having done so, more likely to keep the prisoners alive.

The numbers of Axis soldiers taken captive on the Eastern and Western Fronts are about equal, at 4-5 million.  It's only the number *killed* that is so different between the two: about 4 million in the east, and 1 million in the west.

The USSR did suffer more deaths than any other nation in WWII, and was responsible for defeating just over half the total German manpower.  But it wasn't quite as dominant in that respect as you've implied.

And that's reckoning in terms of manpower.  In terms of industry, Germany put most of its effort into opposing the Western Allies: battleships and anti-bomber defenses take more effort to build than rifles, or even tanks.  So the US and the UK were primarily responsible for overwhelming German industry - even before you factor in the Lend-Lease aid they sent to the USSR.",,/r/europe/comments/bxe58t/poll_in_france_which_country_contributed_the_most/eq6euut/,starswirler,1559827852

I can say that personally most French people I met fucking *HATED* Americans. So that checks out. Some of the most heated arguments I've ever had were about the absurd hostility most Europeans have towards Americans. 

People need to start treating the US like a much better armed North Korea. Would you scream at an indoctrinated North Korean because of the actions of their government?

People don't understand how well developed the system of control is in the US. There's financial control, moral control, thought control. The list goes on. Everything is perfectly engineered to make people pick sides and think things are changing. Thousands or years of social experiments have gone into the development of our 'democracy'.

Every time I talk to angry Europeans, it always boils down to them thinking that they're better than Americans and that we're all evil, stupid, easy targets for their self aggrandizement. Well unfortunately for them, they're not special. 

Everyone, everywhere is exactly the same. We're all susceptible to the same bullshit.

1943,"&gt; They were very modern and pro-America before the ayatollahs

No they weren't. You're talking about the Shah and the elite of the country, not the average Iranian back then. People say this on Reddit because they saw some pictures of Iranian women wearing bikinis or something. 

When those pictures were taken the majority of Iranians lived in rural areas and didn't know much about the West, the majority were poor and conservative. Illiteracy rates were very high. The elite from some urban areas were the ones taking those kinds of photos, they were absolutely not representative of Iran at the time. They were the wealthy educated class of the country (i.e a small minority), who were profiting from the way things were under the Shah.

Furthermore, the shah was brutal, disappearings happened often and people were tortured by the tens of thousands. Life wasn't good at all for the rest. Reddit doesn't care about these things as long as they get to see some women wearing bikinis, because they think that's what makes a nation truly worthy of praise and a beacon of prosperity and human rights. The government in Iran today may be terrible, but going backwards to the days of a brutal corrupt Western puppet isn't the solution, just because he let women wear bikinis. There is a reason there was a revolution.

&gt; It's not like everyone suddenly became pro-sharia

Rather it's the other way around. A region that has been majority Muslim and conservative for centuries isn't going to suddenly become pro-west in the 20th century because they had a Western puppet ruling them. On the contrary, his ideas weren't popular with the working-class people.

What people forget is that the soviets won the eastern front using equipment supplied by the Americans under lend lease. Had they not been supplied, they never would have had a chance. The French probably didn’t.t know this in 1945.

In total, the U.S. deliveries through Lend-Lease amounted to $11 billion in materials: over 400,000 jeeps and trucks; 12,000 armored vehicles (including 7,000 tanks, about 1,386[54] of which were M3 Lees and 4,102 M4 Shermans);[55] 11,400 aircraft (4,719 of which were Bell P-39 Airacobras)[56] and 1.75 million tons of food.[57]

Map US Lend Lease shipments to USSR-WW2.jpg
Roughly 17.5 million tons of military equipment, vehicles, industrial supplies, and food were shipped from the Western Hemisphere to the USSR, 94% coming from the US. For comparison, a total of 22 million tons landed in Europe to supply American forces from January 1942 to May 1945. It has been estimated that American deliveries to the USSR through the Persian Corridor alone were sufficient, by US Army standards, to maintain sixty combat divisions in the line.[58][59]

The United States delivered to the Soviet Union from October 1, 1941 to May 31, 1945 the following: 427,284 trucks, 13,303 combat vehicles, 35,170 motorcycles, 2,328 ordnance service vehicles, 2,670,371 tons of petroleum products (gasoline and oil) or 57.8 percent of the High-octane aviation fuel,[32] 4,478,116 tons of foodstuffs (canned meats, sugar, flour, salt, etc.), 1,911 steam locomotives, 66 Diesel locomotives, 9,920 flat cars, 1,000 dump cars, 120 tank cars, and 35 heavy machinery cars. Provided ordnance goods (ammunition, artillery shells, mines, assorted explosives) amounted to 53 percent of total domestic production.[32] One item typical of many was a tire plant that was lifted bodily from the Ford Company's River Rouge Plant and transferred to the USSR. The 1947 money value of the supplies and services amounted to about eleven billion dollars.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease

Nikita Khrushchev, having served as a military commissar and intermediary between Stalin and his generals during the war, addressed directly the significance of Lend-lease aid in his memoirs:

I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin's views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were ""discussing freely"" among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.",Bavaria (Germany),/r/europe/comments/bxe58t/poll_in_france_which_country_contributed_the_most/eq6f7mr/,joecooool418,1559828044

Although RISC-V is an open ISA under BSD licenses, whoever builds accelerators around that (external accelerator providers) also will have their own patents and licenses. Although the EPI EPAC (custom RISC-V) might also be open-sourced for everyone to contribute into it (even though the BSD license protects the custom implementation - that's a choice the EU has to make, but they might open-source their core).

For now, it seems to offer a large portfolio of accelerator solutions, embedded in multi-chiplet designs. More on this : 
https://sos23.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/VII-4-Denis-EPI.pdf

What is expected seems to be mostly ARM general purpose processors in most of the nodes, but some nodes also share 1 chiplet for a GPP and 1 for a custom accelerator (for now, it seems FPGAs are compatible, as well as Kalray's Manycore MPPAs). It also seems to be relying on HBM memory, on the chip interposers (state-of-the art bandwidths and energy efficient with high memory capacities).

&gt; If you want a bleeding-edge chip, you cannot wait for patents to expire.

If the application is large scale inference/training, the RISC-V approach simplifies a lot of the process. Although you still need to license a lot of software to go from the first designs to the actual manufacturing (likely TSMC 7nm), you use a completly free ISA for most of the in depth work.

Throw out all that is good about the EU (and yes, Eurosceptic as I am, I *do* think there is much about the EU to be admired) for the sake of economic rules which, when you get down to it, are essentially ideological — or change the rules and find a different way of doing it?

Fiscal policy union is not the only solution, but it's the only solution that doesn't involve radical restructuring of the [Fiscal Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Fiscal_Compact).  Either way, it involves making an admission of policy failure which will not be easy to do.

Inflation is bad for asset holders (so bad for investors, especially foreign) and bad for price stability, but price stability isn't worth the price of crumbling foundations.

German ordoliberalism has a good basis, but it's not the end of the argument because it fails to address cases like Italy or the consequences to unemployment rates.  Further, there's no point in ignoring the faultlines because eventually they'll crack open and bite those who benefit from the status quo hard enough for them to wish they'd cared enough to address them earlier.

2204,"I asked around, and if needed be, everyone I asked would go to a new referendum on the matter, hands down. 

The referendum is consultation only, it's very different to the UK referendum, as in black and white. It's more in the line of: now you cannot make laws that legitimize corruption. Of course the politicians will try and swindle shit. Political prostitution is common. And making laws that protect themselves, gimme gimme gimme. Make laws that are made to protect the politicians friends, family, colleague from kindergarten. Ow yea. 

And of course you barely hear about Romania, we hold the EU presidency, our politicians are smart when they have to be. But fuck me if they give a shit about the people who voted for them. That's the dream, become untouchable for 4 years, steal everything like no tomorrow, them live comfortable for the rest of your life, because you're a politician. Fuck you peasant.

And, from a peasant point of view, you get to choose who will steal your money. So pick whoever you want, all are the same. 

Now, the EU actually build roads in the middle of fuking nowhere, and the peasant asks who da fuck got rich? Nobody, the EU paid and foresaw the constitution. 

Then, our President, in a rare moment that he actually spoke something different claimed he will launch a referendum on corruption. 

Yea right. 

Then he did? Dafuck? Ok peasant, time to vote. And vote for the EU while at it. Done deal.

Now, we are after the elections. The referendum passed, and nr 1 party did a nr 2 on themselves. And the leader is sent to jail. And the romania subreddit went drinking.

Now, the constitutional court has a dilemma. Dafuck? 

The EU took a step, the peasant took a step, now, either the politicians take a step or they're going to break they're nek.

Operation Neptune, from D-Day up to 30th June 1944  involved huge naval forces, including 6,939 vessels: 1,213 naval combat ships, 4,126 landing ships and landing craft, 736 ancillary craft and 864 merchant vessels.

Most of the troops who landed on the D-Day beaches were from the United Kingdom, Canada and the US.

You're rather ignorant about the history of the region, or don't know what country and nation means.

&gt; they were not independent countries.

Many of were, and an ""independent country"" or ""independent nation"" is not equal to ""country"" or ""nation"". 

&gt; by those standard - Germany is very diverse because two million Turks live in Berlin area.

You do have Tatarstan and Bashkorstan, Chuvashia line for staters, then the whole Caucasian countries. They're enough to make country diverse and pretty much a continuity of a multi-national state rather than a nation state.

&gt; by those standard - Germany is very diverse because two million Turks live in Berlin area.

If you're not able to grasp the difference between some second generation immigrants and whole nations and countries being included into a federation, I can't help you really. Yes, it's just like Germany. /s

But again, it seems like you don't even know the difference between multi-national and multi-ethnic Russia, federal nation state Germany, and immigrant based federation US.

&gt; or that would be a news for you?

&gt; [here you go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_states)

&gt; spoiler: they were not independent countries

Wait, I can get you not being able to differentiate a country and an independent state, but if you're not just ignorant, but also with some weird courage to claim Russia was even not being multi-national when it was the Russian Empire or Soviet Russia, I will just laugh and move on.

&gt; are they still immigrants after three generations living in germany?

That's why there is a term called second gen or third gen immigrant. True though, they're now just bunch of Germanised folks who just have some symbolic left-overs. But I'm not sure how it helps to your argument.

&gt; maybe they too deserve some autonomy in areas where they are majority.

Ok, and are you advocating doing the same thing to their children and grandchildren? 

&gt; Cyprus is one thing Turkey is another. How long will Turkey be able to keep 40k troops to occupy a state with shitty economy that no one recognises? And Turkish Cypriots are people they care about having a good life. Like Berlin wall fell this one will fall aswell. At this point im like 90% certain Cyprus will be reunited without a deal.

I am 100% behind the reintegration of the north back into the republic. This can be done without ethnic cleansing.

Turkish Cypriots are Cypriots too.

&gt; Thats true but i also see people that are going to jail in Turkey simply for saying theyre Greek.

You won't see me defending the actions of the Turkish state. What I'm saying is that you can't just ignore the last 500 years of history and restore the Roman borders. Constantniople fell in 1453, as did Trebizond a few years later.

If there is an underground movement of Crypto-Greeks (really, a Greek-speaker in the city would probably self identify as Roman, not as a Hellene), awesome, but there's not. It's, as you said, mostly Turks, Kurds, etc. So what are you restoring? And to whom?

&gt; Current Turkey is stronger than Greece. Turkey is aggressive and doesnt respect status quo. Last year invaded Afrin and ethnic cleansed Kurdish people. Now they sent drilling ship in Cyprus and say that Greeks stole their Islands. Every single day our media shows us something about Turkey. Will Turkey leave us at peace? Doesn't look like it. Should they start a war over nothing we need to teach them a good lesson.

Do you not actually know and are making things up as you go along, or are you trying to mislead people? Wikipedia is not laways good, but a simple visit would at least have taught you the basics.

&gt;A - Socialdemokratiet/Social Democrats: One of the oldest parties, the party for the ""working class"" and center of the red side with socialism

The party haven't been for socialism for nearly a century.

&gt;D - Nye Borgerlige/The New Right: A party more liberalistic than Liberal Alliance.

Nothing of the sort. They are a breakaway faction from the Conservatives, and hasa focus on being antiimmigration.

&gt;liberalistic party in the Danish government (not counting the two new ones of D and P).

Neither D nor P have anything with liberalism to do, nor are they in the government.

&gt;O - Dansk Folkeparti (DF)/Danish People's party: A center party

Ok, now I know what your agenda is. No, DF is the main rightwing populist party in Denmark and is mostly known for blaming all problems on immigrants.

&gt;P - Stram Kurs/Hard Line/Strict Course: \[…\] They are classified as blue side liberals

They are far right. Only someone like you would pretend they are liberals.

&gt;V - Venstre/Left: One of the oldest parties on the blue side. They are the center of liberalism

They are not the centre, and while historically liberal, are largely economic Conservatives these days.

&gt;Ø - Enhedslisten - De rødgrønne/Red-green alliance: This is the most socialistic party formed by a fusion of various socialistic parties and the Danish communistic party.

Some of the member parties are directly antidemocratic.

&gt;Å - Alternativet (Alt.)/The Alternative: A new green party that has been voted in from 2015.

This is the same shitlord who gladly threatened anyone who dared even imply that there should be negotiations with the Albanian people in Kosovo. And now we're supposed to applaud him?

The person who shut down news outlets and threatened journalists during his short term as ""Minister of Information"" during the NATO bombing of 1999? Fuck him.

Kosovo is a dump, even more so than Serbia. Kosovo has been de facto independent for 10 years, and for quite some time before that, and yet it has done little to better its situation. It's leaders are pumping the idea of unification with Albania and are imposing sanctions against Serbia, mostly for the purposes of stirring shit up and shifting blame for their failed state to someone else. Vucic gladly takes any bait and proceeds to do the same - distract his constituents from the dreary reality in Serbia and give them a *reality show*. Economy slowing down? Journalistic freedoms took a nosedive? Oh, look - Kosovo!

Squawk all you want, but if Serbia recognized Kosovo this very moment, both Serbia and Kosovo would still be corrupted, unwanted, failed states, and they would remain to be so for decades to come. They would never enter the EU nor would they realistically open any chapters.

Greece debt to GDP went from 176.2% to 181.1% in 2018 while Romania's decresed from 35.2% to 35%, while also having one of the lowest debt to gdp ratios in EU.

So, im not sure Greece is the one laughing in this situation. 

But those german economists surely know how to spread their propaganda that surpluses is all it takes to decrease the debt to gdp ratio.

2510,"That should be difficult to swallow, considering the Leave vote won out (by a slim majority of 80,000 people...by comparison Scotland's 'minority' Leave voters outnumber the Welsh Leavers by ~200,000).

Interesting still is the national identity and ""Welshness"" of voters doesn't tie in to who voted what. For example, Pembrokeshire, known colloquially as ""Little England"" for its proportion of English Retirees and historical present of English people (to the point that the English names of the towns there are cleary misread Welsh ones, i.e. *Dinbych Y Pysgod* became Tenby) had a majority Leave vote, whilst neighboring Ceredigion (having some of the highest amounts of Bilingual and First language Welsh speakers) had a majority Remain vote. So ""Welsh"" people really wanted to Remain right? If you look at the Valleys (an area North/North East of the capitol, Cardiff, famous for it's Coal industry in days past and considerably Welsh),they voted mostly to Leave. 

Similarly in the MEP elections, the national Welsh Remainer party, *Plaid Cymru* won only 2 counties (Ceredigion and... whatever the North one is called where Snowdon and Anglesey are), whilst the Brexit Party won in every other, gaining at least 30-35% of the vote these counties.

The Welsh subreddit is going to half froth at the mouth and half jump in glee from this decision, but I imagine in any upcoming General/Snap election, the voters will polarise but most likely the leavers will win by a small majority again and show their displeasure to the *Senedd*.",O Eire i Gymru,/r/europe/comments/bx5vkz/welsh_government_will_now_campaign_to_remain_in/eq4t3j0/,Superirish19,1559785177

Descent means nothing. There are tons of Greeks of Slavic descent from when the Byzantines lost almost complete control over Greece, but blood means nothing.

Not to be confused with the city of Los Angeles in America. And with ""Los Angeles Times"", which is one of the best selling newspapers in America. This is the village of Losov-Angelevsk in Western Russia, whose local newspaper spreads the obvious Russian propaganda.

2615,"I said Kosovo and Serbia have nothing else to fight about.

I have no idea about RS independence and situation.

Do you understand the issue here? What is pushing these groups to demand independence? Do you understand that something must have gone wrong there? Do you see Albanians demand independence from Albania? Or let's say Belgrade from Serbia? Why don't these random groups of people demand independence from their nation? BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BEING MISTREATED.

The only reason Albanians in N.Macedonia would be tempted to put their life on the line, or any human for that matter, and keeping in mind that it is NOT a religion driven desire - is because they're facing systemic oppression in one form or another. 

I may bitch and moan about the place I live, just like many Albanians who went to Italy bitch and moan about racism/xenophobia, but yet no one is actually willing to pick up arms.

So ask yourself: If you believe Albanians settled in these ""foreign"" lands out of nowhere in the last century (which is obviously not true) why are they willing to die in battle to separate from their ruling government?
Why isn't the same thing happening in Italy where a large wave of Albanians really did poof over there in the last century? Is it because they're not being poisoned in hospitals? hmm maybe? Heck, why don't these Albanians go and unite with their 15th century cousins (Arberesh) and start an Albanian revolution? is it because they have no real complaint against italy? Hmm maybe!

Why don't the Arbanasi in Croatia pick up arms and rebel against the Croatian state? Is it because they don't have any real issue with the SLAVIC Croatia? Hmm....maybe.

Long story short, the only reason anyone would be willing to die for something is because the alternative is a worse choice than one's death.

For America’s first 70 years, private entities, and not the federal government, issued paper money. Notes printed by state-chartered banks, which could be exchanged for gold and silver, were the most common form of paper currency in circulation. From the founding of the United States to the passage of the National Banking Act, **some 8,000 different entities issued currency, which created an unwieldy money supply and facilitated rampant counterfeiting**. By establishing a single national currency, the National Banking Act eliminated the overwhelming variety of paper money circulating throughout the country and created a system of banks chartered by the federal government rather than by the states.

* The Liberal Party (centre-right) benefited from the collapse of the Danish People's Party. 

* Social Democrats slightly improved their results from 2015. 

* The Social Liberals may have hovered up some votes for those opposed to the migration policy of the Social Democrats, and a give-or-take percentage outcome of around 8% does not break any historic ceiling. Danish People's Party also polled higher than they did (11.0%) which doesn't suggest another centrist renaissance.

* Overall, the next Danish Folketing (parliament) is generally in favour of tougher immigration rules with 107 seats falling in their column in a 179 seat parliament.

You linked some pictures, with a Kremlin First channel logo on them, without any context claiming that is the notorius grozny slave market. It had 2 Russian pows there, so what?

Yes, I deny them. There was no slave market in Grozny. Burden of proof is not on me. I can show you a million and one ex Russian facility where they tortured Chechen civillians, care to show at **least one such confirmed notorious salafist slave market haven?** Apparently they were so widespread wow!

2674,"&gt;South Italy has a deep hate for Salvini when he is starting to win or reach close second everywhere.

He has won in provinces which are known for being a shithole, if you compare education and votes you can easily see why Salvini is rapidly becoming the second party around here. Also M5S is a sort of failing party as of right now and most people who voted has switched because their populist propaganda had failed. As of large cities (Turin, Rome, Naples, Milan, Bologna, Florence etc..) PD is still the strongest party, and in general the left-wing gather 90% of their votes here. M5S and Lega have their power grasp in provinces for the most part not really in cities. 

&gt;Why do you hate Saviano?

Just a shitty person, I mean some people appreciate him, but here in Naples for the most part is hated. Mainly because he has been profiting on a social phenomenon (and No, he is not an hero for have spoken against that, there's A LOT of people before him who have done and continue to do the same thing); Also Gomorra is really not that much of an actual reality, is very fictional, and tend to make an hero out of these people who are generally considered the worst human beings. Also it doesn't account a lot of local activities especially in older neighborhoods associated with organized crime for clearing out what is remaining in the city of the work done by the ""Camorra"" (Which by the way nowadays operates away from Naples itself and is dislocated in the metropolitan area and other parts of Italy). There's a lot of cultural activities all the people here are engaged in actively trying to fight Camorra and the general perception Saviano has done of that. It has impacted us deeply and nowadays the popularity of his work is not doing good to Naples.

Oh boy, if only you knew how wrong you are. My parents are completely apolitical and have not bothered tainting me with such issues. All the views I have I formed on my own by doing my own research.

&gt;  Only a complete fool would NOT want peace and co existence. 

The majority of your kind doesn't want peace and co-existence with mine, and vice versa. Albanians and Serbians are literally identical, but on the opposite ends of the spectrum and that's why we will never, ever, in a trillion years be able to co-exist.

Instead you'll claim you already paid your price. Why was that so difficult to admit right at the start? You don't want a compromise.

What I don't understand is then why even flaunt the word compromise so much if you never intended to live up to that in the first place and at least try to meet us half way?

I mean literally your whole argument is that our compromise will be the friends we made along the way and i find that incredibly funny.

The Liberals are desperate to do so, but the Social Democrats have denied that ever since it was suggested by the current Prime Minister.

Greek aggression isn't really the fault of AKP. Greece has never been an ally of Turkey in any decade. As a matter of fact I see kids on Ekşi Sözlük missing the old days when ""Greece was the biggest enemy"".

I think you don't live in Turkey or you are really born in 2002. 

That ""getting rid of all officials"" happened in 2000s, probably when you were a minor. They're called ""Ergenekon trials"". Gulenists made up a fairy terrorist organization called ""Ergenekon"" and accused them of planning a coup. And this led the way to cleansing the army of Kemalist officials.

2967,"One of the first major steps of treatment of depression is deciding if it's a medical or enviromental issue.

&amp;#x200B;

If you treat it as a medical, while it's enviromental, you basically rob the person of the coping mechanism he built while making him feel unjustly guilty over any lack of progress as enviromental factors continue. This is fairly obvious when dealing with a degenerative and/or fatal disease, which genuinely effects their quality of life without doubt or argument.

&amp;#x200B;

If you treat it as an enviromental issue, while it's actually a medical, then you're frustrating and confusing the person, as the depression follows them despite the fact they're ""supposed to feel happy"", and leads to undue feelings of hopelessness which compounds the issue.

&amp;#x200B;

And depression might also be a set of learned behaviors and perceptions, with no medical foundation, that continue in life past the point the original enviromental cause.

2969,"Actually the brothers grimm don't have a bust there! The choice of the Walhalla was always a bit peculiar. Especially in the beginning, it was the greatest Germans with a certain Bavarian view. And in the 20th century, there were only 27 additions with a somewhat renewed interest to honor people in the Walhalla in the late 1990ies. 

There are many people in it which are forgotten. One of the few people in there of my home state, Hesse, is Countess Amalie Elisabeth of Hesse-Kassel. She was a tough women who had to save her realm in the 30 years war and took regency, and to date she is one of the few women in history who was supreme commander of their forces and actually took part in the war council with her generals and developed strategies. Still, totally unknown even here. 

There is another women, Karolina Gerhardinger, living in the 19th century, which is likely to anyone outside of Bavaria. She was a nun who founded a new nun order and obviously Bavarian Catholics lobbied to get her included in the 1990ies. 

There is preference of some professions over others. For example, there are many artists, but as far as I know no architects. With the exception of maybe Justus von Liebig, all the technical inventors and pioneers of Germany are missing who are the fathers of our core industry. 

The Walhalla had insofar a good hand in the selection, that no personality there had to be removed yet.

3042,"Kurds are a blessing when compared to Afghans &amp; Syrians, though. Excluding some very secluded parts of the country where the local population of Kurds are very conservative and nationalist, most Kurds find it easy to blend in and integrate into the society. Kurdish kids growing up in western &amp; central Turkey in particular are almost undistinguishable from their Turkish peers. They are Turkish citizens, they speak fluent Turkish with no accent. They're basically just Turks of Kurdish origin. Turkey has had tons of artists and politicians of Kurdish origin, it's nothing too interesting.

Afghans and Syrians are a totally different story. First, unlike Kurds, they are coming from outside. Second, integration process is almost non-existent and they find it extremely difficult to be part of the society even if they want. However, as far as I see, they don't have such a concern - they prefer creating little Syrias while organizing into mobs and gangs, with no real intention of learning Turkish or being a part of the community.

All in all Kurds are not ""foreigners"" here and we can find ways of living peacefully together. With refugees, this is impossible. You simply can't integrate over 5 million total strangers into the system. They also suffer terribly because of our government's retarded policies but Turks take the biggest toll.

3077,"&gt; The opposite works as well. Just because regulations say it should be below a certain level doesn't mean it's harmful above that level.

You are missing the point so hard: The effects of radiation, even low-level radiation, are **cumulative**.

It's the same point people keep missing when they say ""You are also being exposed to radiation when you fly long-distances!/Bananas are radioactive!"", because while that is technically true, it completely disregards the factual reality that these exposures **keep adding up over time**.

It's like saying taking an X-ray is totally harmless and then proceeding to take 20 X-rays every day for months because ""It's so little radiation, it's harmless"", not it's not, it all adds up over the lifetime of a person.

This isn't even debatable, this is a firmly established scientific consensus. 

&gt; I actually read the report, not just the abstract.

If you'd done that you would have realized that it's a commentary on the report and not the report. Did you also read it's suggestions? Because it suggests **actually doing such studies in more countries** as they haven't been done, as such this represents a massive blind spot, blind spots of which many exist because long-term epidemiological studies are time-consuming, expensive and complex. See:

&gt; The work itself proposes that the observed increase in early postnatal leukemia (the only statistically significant result) is due to a much higher radiosensitivity in fetal cells than is agreed upon by science so far.

Just for you to then go:

&gt; The study doesn't prove this, and it's questionable that it could ever be proven by any ethical testing, although having a look at Chernobyl and Fukushima affected populations might work.

As if studies like that [don't exist](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/30/1/125/619052). But good on you for setting the bar so high that causation could never be proven by any ""ethical testing"", which quite bluntly just translates to: ""You will never be able to prove it!"".

&gt; In fact there is a lot of counterevidence as well, considering the studies that are conducted on populations that live in naturally higher background without the discovery of such effects.

Because it's not like populations living in such areas have always been living there and as such actually had time to physiologically adapt to a certain degree. The same does not hold true for populations living near nuclear reactors because those nuclear reactors haven't been there for hundreds of generations and thousands of years. 

Just like your ""counterevidence"" does in no way ""counter"" the possibility that even these populations would be affected if their background radiation keeps increasing at higher rates than what would naturally occur. It's exactly these dynamics that make epidemiological studies into the effects of long-time exposure so difficult: There's a ton of background noise, cutting through that takes **decades** and requires **actual willingness to do so**, instead of just hand-waving it away because ""There's radiation everywhere anyway, so it must be totally safe"".

&gt; This is disingenuous and nothing but an attempt to poison the well.

It's absolutely not, the NIMBY mindset if prevalent everywhere: A whole lot of this discussion boils down to people from outside of Germany pointing fingers at Germans for not wanting to live near one of these reactors/a waste disposal site. Yet I doubt many of the people pointing fingers are living near such structures/sites themselves because there isn't such a high density of these sites, particularly outside of densely populated Western Europe.

If you have no issues living close to such sites, that's great, enjoy those low rent prices. But don't expect everybody else to just agree with you and gamble with the lives of **their** families because in the end that's still **their** decision whether you like it or not.

As somebody working in cancer-treatment, with children non-the-less, I can completely understand these people. There's nothing worse than watching your own child slowly die in front of you, with literally nothing you can do against it except watch. If there's a chance people can minimize the risk of that happening to their children, then people will take that chance because hindsight does not cure cancer.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/bwp8qy/germany_is_wrong_about_nuclear_power_volkswagens/eq34wxi/,Nethlem,1559749604

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Government of Carles Puigdemont planned for the first moments of an independent Catalunya capture 4.200 million euros in social contributions to companies, spend 499 million euros to activate their own treasury and confiscate real estate to the Spanish State for 19,134 million euros .  
&gt;  
&gt;Among the elements of evidence presented, a draft of a Catalan constitution that foresees important limitations of political rights for parties and officials who do not share the independence movement.  
&gt;  
&gt;For example, and to subtract legitimacy from possible resources or protests from within, the Catalan constitution project seized from Vidal foresaw the limitation of rights to those who implicitly consider internal enemies: ""Catalan citizens will not be able to obtain, nor keep, those people who, not being Catalans of origin, have been military professionals and / or forces of public military or civil order of the Kingdom of Spain and / or have been part of a foreign government "".  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition, the basic rule of the new republic would impose, according to the papers seized, all officials the obligation to choose a single nationality, and would give them six months to decide whether to practice in Catalonia as Catalan citizens or not, but neither exercise.  
&gt;

3097,"Wolfgang Petritsch, the European Union former envoy to Kosovo and ex-High Representative to Bosnia, said on Friday that any Kosovo solution should be European, adding that territory swap was not excluded as a possibility, the FoNet news agency reported.

According to him, Brussels is in position to play openly and not refuse that option.

“It’s been a year since I was deeply engaged in closing on the idea of the two presidents (Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia and Hashim Thaci of Kosovo) who are obviously ready for a compromise in a peaceful way, meaning to cement a big historic compromise between the Serbs and Kosovars,” Petritsch told Deutsche Welle in an interview.

However, he added, Germany suddenly stepped in against the regulation of some things now, “though a Berlin representative was a member of Federica Mogherini (the EU High Representative and the mediator in the Belgrade – Pristina dialogue on normalisation of relations) team and supported her strategy. And then, out of the blue, Germany, (Chancellor Angela) Merkel say – We don’t want that’.”

Petritsch said Brussels was in a position to lead an open dialogue and that it decided there were no ‘red lines’, and that the exchange of territory was possible.

""I don’t think that is the best possible solution, but in given circumstances now, there is no best solution. There are always only tough compromises necessary to calm down the situation,” he added.

He insists that any solution “must be European. I wouldn’t like Washington and Moscow to take part. Anyway, this is a European problem. That’s why Europe has to lead the process.”

Petritsch said a parallel between Serbia and Kosovo and Bosnia and Republika Srpska would not exist even in the case of a border change between Belgrade and Pristina.

“If there is a border change as a result of Kosovo issue negotiations, both sides must accept it. The international rules would be implied, and bilateral border changes are possible only between two sovereign states by consensus,” he explained.

""The negative example of Bosnia and Herzegovina and imposed Dayton Agreement can be seen in the fact that neither side gets along with that after 25 years. The international community, Europe must learn from that example. We want a solution for Kosovo; we want a compromise accepted by both sides,” Petritsch said.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/bx44h2/eu_former_kosovo_envoy_brussels_decides_no_red/eq35jrh/,ChieftainBumblebee,1559749905

&gt;Support Ukraine to join EU/NATO is just as much extending our sphere of influence as reducing Russia's.

But it's not Germany's sphere of influence, is it? It's EU's. You see EU flags flown in Kyiv and not Germany's. Besides, countries like Poland or Lithuania are much more vocal about Eastern partnership countries than Germany.

What is more, it's only natural that the EU which defines itself as a regional alliance, sees every country in Europe as if not a potential member, then at least a close partner. So if a country wishes to pursue closer ties to the EU, of course we'll do that. From our point of view, it's natural and it's not aggressive, it's based on mutual will. If Russia doesn't like it, well, they're a foreign power and as I said, EU has no obligations to make any concessions.

&gt;I don't think sensitivities matter in foreign politics. This is all about national interests and strategic military and economic decisions.

It's naturally in EU's interests to not allow foreign powers to carve spheres of influences in Europe. Nothing about sensitivities here.

&gt;I don't agree. Since we have our own interests, e.g. preventing an open war with Russia, we can not just give a sh\*t and not consider consequences and actions and developments.

Do you really think this country, which is a lot weaker than USSR was, while West is much more powerful, would consider an open war against EU just because it stands for sovereignity of European countries?

Still, calling Spain a nation state is misleading. Spain has to work hard and give all kinds of concessions to its autonomies. Like, all public schools in Catalonia have to have Catalan as their main language of instruction. Despite the fact that 37% claimed Catalan as ""their own language"" in the last linguistic census and that there are actually millions of Castilians also living in the place. Not exactly a nation state if you ask me. 

&gt;true for UK though it’s more clearly divided there and doesn’t create ambiguity. “Brits” don’t feel like some nation

I'm not sure what you're saying here, but it's not a clear cut thing in the UK. There are people who feel British and those who primarily identify with their own nations.

&gt;Overall, the majority of Scots consider themselves their identity to be more Scottish than British. 28% consider themselves to be “Scottish, not British”, whilst another 28% say they are “more Scottish than British.
&gt;A further 29% say that they are “equally Scottish and British”, whilst just 10% believe they are either British or more British than Scottish

https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2016/09/07/what-makes-person-scottish

&gt;Most people, of all ages, feel both English and British and they do so strongly, even when it is not a particular source of pride. But there are some important shifts taking place. The oldest generation feels its Englishness more strongly than its Britishness (68% feel very strongly English, but only half feel very strongly British). As we move down the generations, the balance between English and British identity becomes more balanced. When asked whether people are more English or more British, the ‘more English’ are ahead of the ‘more British’, but less and less in each age group:  until amongst the 18-24 year-olds the ‘more British’ move ahead of the ‘more English’.",Russia,/r/europe/comments/bx0rjm/russian_with_knife_shouting_allah_akbar_attacks/eq2ps7e/,Aga-Ugu,1559741844

It was Viktor Orbán's government that actually paid back IMF by throwing out templorary taxes on all banks (not the people) and ensured by law that the banks cannot push these taxes on their clients in various ways.",,/r/europe/comments/bwzowb/a_climate_of_fear_hungary_inside_a_dying/eq2dame/,_Constellations_,1559734401

The burden of proof is on you, you rabid idiot. You said earlier that all or most of the anti-immigration parties deny climate change, **you have to prove that**. 

&gt; Objectively wrong again, Malta?

Fair enough, he was wrong. Tiny little Malta took in a higher percentage number than Sweden lol Unfortunately for you, it doesn't change his point. It just makes you look like a bigger quarrelsome cockhead than you already are. 

&gt; No go-zones.. you sound like a dumb American brainwashed by FoxNews.

Are you even real at this point? Surely you must be trolling... God, you're cunt-y :P

Depends on how no-go zones are defined. Literal no-go zones I don't think there are any evidence for. 

The Ambulance union in Sweden described areas they can't go without police protection as 'no go zones' in 2017. Again, they can go there but only with police protection. So would you call it a no-go zone? I don't know. 

Police officers(in Sweden) have themselves referred to the worst ghettos in Sweden as 'no go zones'. 

Police take special precautions going into certain ghettos in Sweden but they still go there so yeah maybe 'no go zones' is a misleading term. 

&gt; Sweden has one of the lowest murder rate in the world

Whereas Norway has pretty much halved its homicide rate since the late 90s and early 2000s(from 1 to 0.5/100,000, Sweden's hasn't declined much or at all, with the homicide rate hovering around 1-1.5/100,000 recently like it did in the early 2000s or 90s. 

Still low, granted but again maybe not the decline they should have seen? Gang violence(usually non-natives) remains a problem in Sweden and its responsible for quite a large percentage of murders in Sweden. So there is nothing wrong the statement ''gang shootings are normalized'' even though it might not be as bad as other places.

I don’t particularly like to barter, and tbh for anything beyond basic bartering it takes longer than the item is worth. 
The problem is that when I go to SE Asia or other similar places I have budgeted for a lower price to offset the flight costs, so part of the reason to come was the lower prices. Second, I don’t mind paying western prices if I get western service (warranty, regulated products etc), but most of the time it’s not as good. 
And finally, I hate feeling ripped off. Yeah, that taxi that should cost £2 cost me £10 it’s not the end of the world but man I feel like I’m being taken advantage of, and I hate that feeling.

The navy is not regarded as a strategic tool of military policy. Quite the opposite. The defence concept emphasises that equipment is generally only planned and procured for direct national defence.

3347,"&gt; We do indeed put it to a vote, what do you think the Law is? We essentially put it up to a public debate for the sake of seeking ""justice"". If the decision seems too disconnected from the public then it gets changed, either through protests, rioting, whatever.

  


My point is that even collectively choosing a method to decide is impossible without basing yourself in reason. The only way around using reason is perhaps violence Indeed. But then again, if you riot with a group of people you probably used reason to rally them to your cause.

  


&gt; my problem is that people in the modern day, especially on reddit, seem to only be aware of the utilitarian argument and nothing beyond it.

  


Well feel free to present an alternative then. It's just that saying ""but emotions"" doesn't really cut it. There are good reasons why utilitarianism is so widespread, but I think my arguments would also hold from a deontological point of view.

  


&gt; Is the soothing of the victims and public not precisely a real positive outcome? How come for example, in assault cases where the victim agrees to take money from the perpetrator, this is seen as ""restorative"" and not ""retributive""? Are these not effectively the same thing taken with a different attitude?

  


Soothing of people's pulsions is way too subjective a goal for societal justice to begin with. If the culprit's brother feels wronged on account of the punishment being way too harsh for the crime committed, is it also justice's duty to soothe him? Again, feel free to present an argument in favour of vengeance in our justice system, but I think you'll quickly realize there is good reasons why we steered away from it and don't use whippings for example as a punishment.

And restoration has a goal in mind, restoring the victim. If ""harm"" is done to the culprit (like a fine) it is with goal in mind, while in vengeance the harm caused is precisely the goal.

&gt; How can we possibly measure this harm? I'm sorry, but isn't this precisely the issue? Utilitarians only suggest a proxy, a proxy that clearly only works in their own point of view!

We don't measure it in the strict sense of the word. A society decides the scales of such things through debate, reason and democracy like you said earlier.

  


&gt; It seems to me that our common ground is precisely our emotions; both of us feel rape is bad, that murder is bad, that freedom is good, ect. whilst we can of course attempt to change these via arguments, these are \*still\* emotional judgements. We can't exactly argue if one of us thinks suffering is good and should be maximised instead of happiness, can we!

  


Even agreeing on such points necessitates the same understanding of ""rape"", ""murder"", ""freedom"", ""suffering"" or ""happiness"", and that is only achievable through communicative reason. Emotions are purely subjective, and while we may sometimes tend to have the same emotions for the same objects of thought (and that's a risky assumption to make), the only way to make it intersubjective is to abstract your emotions through reasoning.",Challenging Reddit narratives since 2013,/r/europe/comments/bwr0l7/teen_girl_legally_euthanized_after_brutal_rape/eq23vo0/,NuruYetu,1559727540

&gt; By the summer of 1943, the transports to the Sobibór death camp were slowing down. The veteran Jewish prisoners sensed that the end was quickly approaching. In July, the prisoners organized an underground unit. 

&gt;  They devised a daring plan. SS officers would be lured into storehouses on the pretext that they were to be given new coats and boots. Once inside – aided by the bold efforts of Thomas (Tuvia) Blatt—they would be attacked by the prisoners and killed with axes and knives. Nazi weapons were to be seized, and at roll call the camp would be set ablaze. All prisoners would have a chance to bolt for freedom. Once outside Sobibór’s gates, they would all be on their own.

&gt; At 4:00 p.m. on October 14, 1943, the first SS soldier was killed with an axe. Ten more SS men were killed, as were several Ukrainian guards. Telephone wires and electricity lines were cut. Within an hour, the camp was burning, guns were aimed at the guard towers, and the first group of prisoners fled across the German mine fields surrounding the facility.

&gt; By dusk more than half the prisoners—about 300 people—had escaped. Most were killed by their Nazi pursuers or died crossing the minefields. After the revolt, some joined partisan units; others found shelter among sympathetic Poles. It is estimated that just 50 of the escapees survived the war.

The result will be a French-Italian company registered in Paris and Milan with access to America via Fiat (which will remain and Italian brand) and Japan via Renault (which will remain a French brand).

I just believe all the red tape stops lots of companies from doing it.

I do not think most people understand the waste and byproducts of nuclear power. Sealing up nuclear waste is an extremely small foot print and easy to do. I suppose the downsize is the foot print will be there a long long long, at least until we figure out how to deal with it. Which i agree with.

3460,"Don't misunderstand me, I completely agree that there are cultural differences between different people from different regions. And yes, indeed, it would be hard if not impossible to create a society as you describe it. But nations, even though they may have intended to preserve culture, also destroy many regional cultures in name of the nation. Here are some examples. At the time of the French Revolution, only about 5% of the country spoke French. By the mid twentieth century, more than a hundred French regional languages had vanished after centuries of centralised, homogeneous education. Why do you think Slovakia and Poland could only become nations when both were relatively ethnically homogeneous? Like the rest of Europe, Central Europe was an extremely heterogeneous region with numberless different peoples most often living in peace with each other. Only after mass deportation and genocide, nations could be created there. Moreover, only in the name of nationalism, Germany could kill so many innocent Jewish people.

This is really nothing new I am saying. Many historians agree that the nation is extremely ambiguous: it is supposed to emancipate a people and partly does so, but for which price? The price of a lot of blood. That price is paid by those who cannot fit the narrowly defined 'nation' in which they have been living for centuries (Jews in Germany, Germans in Poland, Turks in Greece, etcetera).","Limburg, Netherlands",/r/europe/comments/bwlay5/a_girl_looking_at_the_ruins_of_warsaws_ghetto/eq1vqsq/,biendeluxe,1559720689

If they win elections more often at the regional level the reform would benefit them but that doesn't make it fascist. It's a perfectly legit system that many democracies have.

Authoritarians consider that if they can win just one election of the vote they should be able to do whatever they want, but that's not how democracy's supposed to work. Which is why when an authoritarian party control one branch of government they always do everything they can to subjugate the other branches, such as the judiciary (we've seen that in Poland itself) but also local governments (if you'll allow me a Godwin point in Germany it's generally considered that the Nazi dictatorship really starts when they illegally removed regional governments by decree).

And this happened because everyone had some dirt on theselves. Babiš operated during that time and he got rich during that time. He is no different. It is also no secret that Babiš was part of STB (CzechoSlovakian variant of KGB). The only thing that is conspiracy are death bodies around him. You can find few people including Mrázek that were very problematic for him during that time and only thing you can not do is link him to their murders which means that he is innocent in that but death bodies showed around him in the past when he was on his way to become rich by being part of Wild West privatization.


The reason why I would not be surprised in the slightest is because I know what kind of person Babiš is and how he has systematically destroyed small bussinesses.


Anyway it is easy to write it off all as conspiracy and honestly I it was because reality is trully depressing however I would suggest you to read book Boss Babiš and only then make your opinion.

Just like the radiation exposure thresholds were way lower than they needed to be, that's why they [were raised](http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-Japan-to-raise-worker-emergency-radiation-exposure-limits-2101154.html) when it was impossible to stay below them, [even for children](http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2011/s3225020.htm).

A decision that isn't exactly [uncontroversial](https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23772&amp;LangID=E), because there's already plenty of evidence that even reactors that didn't suffer a catastrophic failure pose a health risk to certain risk groups living near them, like [children and pregnant women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2757021/).

3610,"People regularly misstate the facts about the electricity situation in Germany and almost always it is done by non-Germans who only know of the decision to phase out nuclear energy and nothing more. It is a decision made with broad support in politics, society and science debated over many decades. Yes, you will find few scientists with deep knowledge about the situation who criticise it and many who support it. Just like the new decision to phase out coal by 2038, the main point critisized was, that the phase out could have been done faster and renewables could have been built out faster (i.e. subsidized more).

Of course on reddit, the decision is mocked by armchair 'specialists' who have no idea about the decades of debate, etc. and think they know everthing better. Mix that with half knowledge of a supposedly safer and better nuclear reactor design that by the way was also tested in Germany and failed a long time ago.

With renewables we have a good way forward, we have a set of known problems to solve and a set of options to solve them with research going on to find out the comparative practicality of the solutions, etc.

Points I heard on reddit when the phase out was decided:

1. Soon Germany will be a (net) importer of electricity by a large margin. Instead of producing its own nuclear energy, it will be imported from France. None of that happened. Actually the opposite seems to happen: Germany regularly leads the statistics of biggest net electricity exporter.

2. Coal usage will 'skyrocket'. As I have shown, that hasn't happened either. Coal usage decreased and continues to decrease.

And even know, years after the fact, people find more and more ways to criticise it.

It’s self-centred in the extreme to think that people making different choices to you are irrational or hypocrites (if that’s what you were getting at with the driving comments), because it dismiss that other people might have experience, preferences, risk tolerances and considerations that you don’t share. Just because *you* are okay with hitchhiking does not mean everyone else has to be.

As for your driving analogy, what the actual fuck? *Being fine with a difficult to avoid risk doesn’t obligate people to take every avoidable or minimisable risk simply because it’s less likely to occur*. 

Am I now not allow to wear a helmet when riding my bike, because an accident where I would get a preventable head injury is less likely than a car accident? What about walking through streets after dark when there’s no streetlights? Crime is so low here that I will probably be fine, am I obligated to take that risk just because I have taken a bigger one by being in a car?

Oh, and “if your uncle was in a car accident would you say you shouldn’t drive, haha gotcha”? He’s also attended hundreds of car accidents and scraped brains off bitumen (along with dozens of murders, suicides and assorted accidents), because that’s literally his job.

3663,"Debate is growing in Italy about the suggestion that a new domestic currency could be introduced by the government to pay its debts — and the possibility that Rome’s Eurosceptic coalition might use it to facilitate the nation’s departure from the euro. 
Prominent members of deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini’s ruling League party have floated the proposal — which was endorsed by a vote in the Italian parliament last week. But how would it work, and how likely is it to happen? 

**What is this parallel currency idea?**

The Italian government should issue debt in small denominations which can change hands as a medium of exchange — that, at least, is the view of key advisers to Mr Salvini.
Claudio Borghi, one of the League’s most influential economic advisers, has championed the idea, as has Alberto Bagnai, president of the finance committee in Rome’s Senate. Mr Borghi, who has been strongly critical of Italy’s membership of the single currency, is president of the budget committee in the lower house of Italy’s parliament. 
The proposal involves creating a new type of Treasury bill — dubbed mini-bills of Treasury (mini-BOTs) — which could be used by the government to pay the arrears it owes to commercial businesses, and by citizens to pay their taxes, Mr Borghi has suggested. 
Thus it would have the scope to grow into what would in effect be a parallel domestic currency, separate from Italy’s official currency, the euro. 
Although there are no detailed proposals, Tommaso Monacelli, professor of economics at Bocconi University, said that mini-BOTs could range from €1 to €50 in face value, and have no interest rate or maturity date.
Mr Salvini did not tap Mr Borghi and Mr Bagnai for ministerial positions that would give them any power to implement their radical ideas, but their rise to legislative posts has given them a platform to set out their policy proposals.
The League, which governs in coalition with the leftwing Five Star Movement, included mini-BOTs in its election manifesto last year, and the coalition agreement also mentions them. 
The idea received wider attention last week when markets took fright after the Italian parliament passed a vote calling on the government to consider using mini-BOTs as a way of paying its debts to suppliers.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bwyodh/italy_revives_alternative_currency_proposal/eq1i7tn/,FriendOfOrder,1559710079

3665,"**Why would this be controversial?**

The introduction of what could in effect constitute a parallel domestic currency would undermine Italy’s membership of the euro, Marcello Messori, director of the school of European political economy at Luiss University, said: “The issue of mini-BOTs is a way to facilitate the creation of a double monetary circulation.”
Riccardo Puglisi, an economist at the University of Pavia, said the proposal was “a way to facilitate the exit of Italy from the eurozone”. 
That would leave Italy in breach of European treaties, some argue. 
“A legal tender can only be made by law, but this would contravene the treaty on the euro,” according to Lorenzo Codogno, a former chief economist at the Italian Treasury. 
The Bank of Italy has rejected that suggestion on the grounds that “since it would not be legal tender, it would not violate the provisions of the European treaties regarding money issuance”.
“No one wants it to be made legal tender now. There is no uncertainty about that,” said Mr Codogno. “Still, once in circulation it could become legal tender in the future.”",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bwyodh/italy_revives_alternative_currency_proposal/eq1iah1/,FriendOfOrder,1559710134

Placing controls is not virtue signalling that's not what virtue signalling means. It's to help people think their thoughts through properly. A lot of people on here will instinctively shout something down as racist (say returning boat migrants back to Libya through the Libyan coast guard) without actually thinking through why. Should anyone be allowed to move to Europe without need for a visa? Most people would say no. So we've then accepted the premise of controls we can get away from the jingoistic language that's used to polarise the debate. Everyone is on the same sliding scale and it's just what you choose to control. 

I don't see a need or a gain for a higher ethical standard. It's unobtainable. Europe cannot save the world by bringing the world to Europe. African problems need African solutions. Asian problems need Asian solutions. Driven by the people of those continents. The developing world needs to develop and build its own institutions.

&gt; I am not voting for the guy, but the people saying that Stram Kurs (Hard Line) is calling for ethnic cleansing are just plain wrong.

He is calling for ethnic cleansing. This is their platform:

""Denmark must expel any non-western person who has obtained asylum and who is not an original citizen in one of Denmark's neighboring countries. Denmark must expel any non-western person who is not a Danish citizen.

""The expulsion must be such that non-western persons with temporary residence permit do not receive their residence permit renewed. Non-Western foreigners with permanent residence permits should as a rule have the license canceled and expelled.""

I'm going to walk you through this real slow since the fact that we are at this point is ridiculous. From this platform you can clearly see that he is calling for the expulsion of minorities from Denmark, yes?

The definition of ethnic cleansing:

""**the mass expulsion** or killing of members of an unwanted ethnic or religious group in a society""

There you have it. He is calling for the expulsion of minorities which is literally ethnic cleansing

3730,"&gt; But your problem then is that we live in a society, and while you can have very personal emotions about the fairness of a situation, justice is a societal concept by nature. Whose emotions then dictate justice and the right punishment for a rapist? Yours? Mine? The culprit's? The victim's? Should we put it to a vote?

We do indeed put it to a vote, what do you think the Law is? We essentially put it up to a public debate for the sake of seeking ""justice"". If the decision seems too disconnected from the public then it gets changed, either through protests, rioting, whatever.

I do see your point; the two are unseperable entirely. Emotions set our base desires, our desires set up our arguments, and our arguments change our emotions; Its all Overdeterministic I suppose. What actually *is* just, or justice, is far more than a simple utilitarian calculation, was my point. There are more theories, philosophical stances and political views on Justice than can be counted; my problem is that people in the modern day, especially on reddit, seem to only be aware of the utilitarian argument and nothing beyond it.

&gt;Vengeance or retribution is harming the culprit with no real positive outcome just to soothe the subjective pulsions of certain people.

Is the soothing of the victims and public not precisel a real positive outcome?  How come for example, in assault cases where the victim agrees to take money from the perpetrator, this is seen as ""restorative"" and not ""retributive""? Are these not effectively the same thing taken with a different attitude?

&gt;It's even more a problem if you factor in the imperfections of justice systems and the possibility of retribution cascades.

Of course, Vengeance from a pragmatic view tends towards mass violence pretty quickly, though I don't think pragmatism excuses ignoring vengeance from a theoretical standpoint.

China is a (very) large country, and one which you can simply not generalize like many people (unfortunately) do. The country grew very fast over the last few decades, and there are major differences in welfare between cities that are relatively close to each other, let alone provinces.

As someone who isn't Chinese, but involved closely with Chinese people. I know several who were born in Shanghai, and their opinion may be biased but perhaps other people can give input on this as well.

In general, the rural people in China are more often the rude and uneducated ones, while people from large cities are closer to ""Western standards"" if you will. Keep in mind that in cities like Shanghai you may still experience people like these, which are typically people who moved to Shanghai recently and do not completely share the same welfare, education and so forth with people who were born there.

Many cities in China have different dialects or even languages, more than a hundred if I recall correctly. The people I know can differentiate rude people bases on their accent, which they say they base their opinion on.

In most of today's advanced societies, that approach is pointless and redundant since the average Joe is knowledgeable and wise enough for the mere thought of the potential consequences to be a powerful deterrent.

3878,"&gt; `Say we can revert CO2 from atmosphere back underground. Then yes we would. Delay what? Are you assuming that we are going to combust it into space again?

You would not solve the sustainability issue because carbon negative forestry is not sustainable. You can't keep storing CO2 forever.

You just delay the problem to when you will no longer be able to store any.

&gt; Where have I suggested this?

It's the premise of the entire discussion. Since Finland cannot easily access renewable energy, they want to use forestry to offset the carbon positive energy landscape. That's not sustainable. Fossil fuels are not and cannot ever be sustainable.

Sustainability requires a closed loop. The only way to create sustainable ""fossil fuels"" is if the resulting product is more fossil fuel. That's called biomass.

Fossil Fuel -&gt; Atmosphere -&gt; Carbon Capture is not sustainable. You'll run either out of fossil fuels or out of place to store the captured carbon.

Biofuel -&gt; Atmosphere -&gt; Forests -&gt; Biofuel _can_ be sustainable if the loop is balanced.

Sorry if the translation is a bit off, English is not my mother tongue.

A euthanasia request can come from patients with a mental illness, and is covered under the law. [...] The patient *must* have a medical condition, people who are world-weary or see their life as complete, but do not have a medical condition, are not covered under the law.

But Finland is currently building new nuclear reactors, and geothermal heating is also growing rapidly, so a part of the transformation to carbon neutrality is already underway. Not sure how high potential for wind energy is here, but I would assume it can also grow to have a decent share by 2035. Solar energy is not that great this north, but it can have a role during the summer. With a bit of subsidy for panels, combined with prices hopefully still going down, there is likely going to be a fair share of solar energy too for non-winter months.

Still, it is an ambitious plan. It will be interesting to see what exactly is the plan for achieving it. 

 Incidentally, my family just recently considered buying solar panels, but our consumption is low that it would've taken 15 to 20 years to break even, so I guess we won't do it just yet.

4072,"&gt; His electorate is probably the most active one there is in this country 

That's not true. His electorate is most of all politically naive and not very ideological – it's composed mostly of people who don't care about politics in the sense of ideas, they care about benefits like higher welfare, pensions, etc. These people used to vote for ČSSD and now they've deserted it for Babiš, because he's better at promising stuff. 

EP elections simply don't interest these people. On the other hand, the liberal/right wing opposition got more mobilised because urban liberal voters care more about foreign politics, the EU, and most of all they hate Babiš so they came and voted in greater numbers than usual, as is clear from the higher-than-average voter turnout in cities like Prague, Brno and others.

These two factors (ANO voters' apathy and the opposition voters' mobilisation) contributed to the bad result for ANO. But there is no reason to believe that in national elections with about 60% turnout he wouldn't get 10% more – especially if STAN and TOP09 fell below the 5% threshold and their votes were lost and redistributed (our system slightly favours larger parties in the calculation).

You are right that surveys are unreliable, but the fact is the society is still fairly evenly split and all it takes is for the liberal opposition to remain disunited and Babiš can win again and perhaps cobble together a new government with the Commies and SPD.

That being said it’s nearly impossible to maintain a culture when the majority of that already tiny population has been destroyed. Especially when much of that culture was not necessarily written and most of it existed within the hearts and minds of the people who perished. Another thing to keep in mind is that the Western and eastern European Jewish culture is not the culture of all Jews or Israel. I think a good metaphor for the state of the culture would be this.... imagine a great novel like Ulysses. Someone sets that the book on fire destroying 75% of the only copy. You can talk about how great Ulysses was, teach future generations about it, remember and cherish the memory but you will never be able to recreate it the way it was, and it will never be the same. Those words would be lost forever in the same way much of the Jewish culture has been lost. Youre right, the responsibility is ours to carry on and survive and many are doing what they can, we have to be self reliant. But I would not blame them for the loss as if they failed to live up to some ideal that was brought about by the actions of the Nazis.

4170,"I'm talking about now, not then. You knock yourself out if you want to invest your time in protesting and fighting a battle that's bigger than you. The rest of us will just enjoy ourselves. You're not fighting communism now, you're fighting corruption, and it's wise to pick your battles. What's your solution to this problem? 

Sure, he's corrupt, but do you think the next one won't be? How naive. It's one thing to identify a problem, it's another to have prepared a viable solution. Half of the people out there want Babis gone but haven't even thought about after that fact. What if the next person is worse? You going to keep protesting? Life continues to pass you by fighting a battle you were never going to win.

In the end you'll get to the point that I did with the UK. You can't save the world, or society, or whatever, without first saving yourself. You can only control yourself and can only do your best by yourself as a link in a huge chain. If more people invested in themselves and made themselves better links the overall chain would benefit, but instead they'll just continue on protesting, blaming the government etc. It's a philosophy and outlook of utter despair.

I left the UK to come to the Czech Republic. Whilst they're all still whinging about Brexit and other bullshit the elites will do with as they please regardless of a democratic mandate or not, I'm having a fantastic life out here, because I took my destiny into my own hands, didn't yell at the government hysterically to fix my shit. These people will never find happiness because they want to continue to be hysteric and yell and not walk away from an abusive situation. When your government is abusing you, just like in any abusive relationship, the best thing is to not give it your time of day, because then it knows it's under your skin emotionally, has you under its control, at it's will.

The simple fact is you will have more peace just accepting and learning to ride each wave thrown at you in life as opposed to trying to play superhero and saving the world. Tomorrow isn't guaranteed anyway. You're protesting and giving up each important moment and tomorrow one of those protesters could die, and what did they do? They spent their last moments of their live on a corrupt bastard like Babis instead of the people that matter, and themselves. 

They are not worth it, and neither are the corrupt bastards who will go in and replace Babis. The same cycle will continue because they're all in cahoots with one another. If it's not Babis it's Farage. If it's not Farage it's Trump. If it's not Trump it's Salvini. If it's not Salvini it's some other self serving corrupt fuck.

Not a single one of them are worthy of my time. Babis is probably looking out at that laughing at all the people he has in hysterics and under his control. They hate him so much and he has such emotional control over them that they give up their free time just to let him know. He's the winner here. All that crowd did today was further validate the government's control over you and how it can make the puppets dance, just like any protest.

&gt;The city of Warsaw, capital of Poland, flanks both banks of the  Vistula River. A city of 1.3 million inhabitants, Warsaw was the capital  of the resurrected Polish state in 1919. Before World War II, the city  was a major center of Jewish life and culture in Poland. Warsaw's prewar  Jewish population of more than 350,000 constituted about 30 percent of  the city's total population. The Warsaw Jewish community was the largest  in both Poland and Europe, and was the second largest in the world,  second only to New York City.  
&gt;  
&gt;Following the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, Warsaw  suffered heavy air attacks and artillery bombardment. German troops  entered Warsaw on September 29, shortly after its surrender.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;On August 1, 1944, the Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa; AK), a  non-Communist underground resistance army with units stationed  throughout German-occupied Poland, rose against the German occupation  authorities in an effort to liberate Warsaw. The impetus for the  uprising was the appearance of Soviet forces along the east bank of the  Vistula River. The Soviets failed to intervene; the Germans eventually  crushed the revolt and razed the center of the city to the ground in  October 1944. Though they treated captured Home Army combatants as  prisoners of war, the Germans sent thousands of captured Polish  civilians to concentration camps in the Reich. 166,000 people lost their  lives in the uprising, including perhaps as many as 17,000 Polish Jews  who had either fought with the AK or had been discovered in hiding.  
&gt;  
&gt;When Soviet troops resumed their offensive on January 17, 1945, they  liberated a devastated Warsaw. According to Polish data, only about  174,000 people were left in the city, less than six per cent of the  prewar population. Approximately 11,500 of the survivors were Jews.

TL;DR: NAZIS reduced a city of approximately 3.1 million (approx 350,00 were Jewish) to about 174,000.",,/r/europe/comments/bwlay5/a_girl_looking_at_the_ruins_of_warsaws_ghetto/epzcmwp/,schoocher,1559663015

I said they are responsible for the continuation of their culture. Every nation is and that's a fact - if you don't want your culture to die off, then you defend it and cherish it. If you as a nation decide that your own culture is inferior to others and therefore you decide to blend in, then by all means, do so. But don't claim it was another nation that led you to this self-destructive path of downfall. It would be self-inflicted genocide no matter what nation we're talking about.

Now, I didn't say they're the only ones who would be blamed for their (future and possible) cultural destruction, after the war they knew it was not the end for them even though they had lost a staggering portion of their people. They had and still have their chance to continue their majestic legacy. If en-masse they decide it's not worth it and decide to destroy the culture of their ancestors for which they were being persecuted to the brink of destruction, only then can we say it was their doing that was the last nail in the coffin. Which it would be, since luckily, the Nazis did not succeed in making them go extinct, but their own moves could spell a disaster for such a mysterious and tragic civilization.

&gt;“It almost certainly will remain deeply distrustful of the USSR and view the Warsaw Pact [former USSR-led military pact] as the only credible threat to its security,” the file reads, explaining that the US can best keep Yugoslavia distant from the USSR, by “giving continued political, military and economic support to Belgrade”.

That was the policy in 1986.

That policy started in 1951 https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/united-states-gives-military-and-economic-aid-to-communist-yugoslavia

This paper is quite interesting: https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=bgsu1206322169&amp;disposition=attachment

&gt;An examination of the
Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter Administrations dealings with a nonaligned and
socialist Yugoslavia shows that the United States during the height of the Cold War could
maintain good relations with a Communist state to uphold a wedge in the Soviet Bloc and to
preserve regional geo-strategic balance.

Until the mid 80s US/Yugo had fairly good relations, with a mutual interest in keeping the Soviets at bay.

The two estimates you linked to show that the US was convinced that Yugo was going to disintegrate, and that armed conflict was possible if not likely.  But I don't see anything about the US encouraging a break up.  Of course the US would try to work the chaos to its advantage for long term gain.

Interestingly, I've heard from a number of redditors that Germany was in favor of a break up, as it would open up new markets for export.  Germany was very pro Croatian independence, which in my opinion was a bad look, considering how well the Nazis and Ustache got along.

Obviously I understand why people would suspect US meddling (and there was), but these Bosnians were saying the primary reason for the US to incite the breakup was because Yugo was such a powerful symbol of communist success and inter-ethnic unity that it couldn't be permitted to survive.  I don't buy that at all.  Communism was circling the toilet by the late 80s, and Yugo was an economic basket case, and as the CIA estimates show, there were already tensions.  These poor folks just missed the days of Tito desperately and had a hard time accepting the demise of Yugoslavia.",,/r/europe/comments/bv4eu2/exactly_27_years_ago_on_may_31_1992_the_bosnian/epyzume/,Le_Updoot_Army,1559655184

4380,"Hahaha woohooo! I absolutely loved your guys bier over there! I remember drinking lemonade and beer (radler?) until I was sick.

I feel like you and I actually share very similar values, but you are more optimistic and I am very alarmist. 

The reason I feel the need to include birthrates is because it is a well founded issue that second and third-generation immigrants are more prone to extremism than their parents. I've been looking for a really good report I read a few years ago on this but cant find it. It argued that second-generation extremism happens for two reasons: 1) feeling they dont belong in their host country nor their emigrated country and 2) rose tinted nostalgia for their parents country, and as they never grow up there they don't know the horrors of extremism. A good proportion of the terror attackers recently have been second-generation migrant. I think increases in this second/third-generation migrant level will result in more extremism. I think its short sited and unfair for the next generation to not address this issue because they will be the ones dealing with it. Whether that's investing in more integration programs, or reassessing immigration rates - looking at the data something needs to be done.

However, as per everything the higher rate of extremism in second generation migrants is most likely a combination of multiple factors: Wahhabi founding, archaic religious customs, inspiration from over seas terror groups, not being welcomed at host countries and so on. To solve on of these issues, I think the fastest way for Muslims to integrate is to reform Islam. [This Pew Research is terrifying](https://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-morality/), almost no non-western Muslims believe Homosexuality is fine while about half people believe honour killings are acceptable. Its hard for host countries to accept immigrants normally, but much more difficult when almost all of them are extremists. 

I also want to say that I honestly have nothing wrong with Muslim people, in my lab I work with many Islamic people and a girl I hang out with often prays in my office. I understand that were all people at the end of the day. But the indoctrination of Muslims to become extremists by the greater Islamic community is what is causing these problems. And until we reform Islam, I honestly think slowing Immigration from Muslim countries is the safest option at the moment.",,/r/europe/comments/bv8mta/danish_muslims_feel_backlash_as_immigration/epz0xk0/,agent_cody_banks420,1559655913

4400,"&gt; What they did in Chernobyl was ignoring safety prescriptions, with the result as known. So proposing to reduce safety regulations is not the way to go

Not ignoring, actively turning safety measures OFF, in order to perform an experiment. With the existing safety measures turned ON it would have never happened.

&gt;If ""it's not impossible"" is good enough, renewables can take that too.

Maybe I should have specified the conditions. I think ideally our electricity production is 100% reliable to deliver power when we need it AND emits zero carbon. That's not something we can do with renewables only, at least not in our country.

&gt;Again, I explained the technical and economical reasons why choosing to build nuclear will still directly necessitate gas emissions in the short term, and discourage investment in renewable alternatives in the long run.

No you didn't. You give a suspicion on why that would happen, entirely relying on how you think the government should make the transition. Again, political choices: we could have a government owned nuclear plant for all I care (as a public service, so no profit incentive needed). The point is that, if we don't go nuclear, carbon emissions WILL rise in the short term. And with the urgency as communicated by IPCC, that's not a good thing.

In general you're still arguing as if a political choice that nuclear is not desireable is a fact we just have to accept. I disagree with that, as do most scientists around me (and as a scientist, that's a lot of people). You're left with economical arguments, and I agree that they make sense, but the cold, hard science at the moment tells us that carbon emissions need to be tackled NOW and that nuclear is the only way to do that if we want to guarantee electricity supply.",,/r/europe/comments/bvvaxx/a_quiet_revolution_sweeps_europe_as_greens_become/epyqexy/,Squalleke123,1559647899

4553,"&gt; Is the only criteria for democracy an election?

Free and fair elections for all citizens without any discrimination is a textbook democratic principle. However, if you think about it the only state that can pass as a real democracy is maybe Switzerland. Every other state is an elective oligarchy.

&gt;The problems with freedom of speech, the denial of contribution of polish citizens to the holocaust, the weird abortion laws,pressure on supreme court, those are all good?

None of which really apply to democratic principles. Maybe republican principles, but certainly not democratic. Let's go through them one by one.

Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech in Poland as guaranteed by the UDHR.

Nobody is denying that Polish citizens participated in the Holocaust. What is being denied is the slander that the Polish gov't in exile and its constituent organisations like the AK participated in the Holocaust. They didn't, it's a fact. Anything said otherwise is dangerous disinformation.

The abortion laws were decided upon with the consent of the masses.

The supreme court as it is in Poland is a relic from the communist gov't and was long due for reforms anyway.

Only the last one really applies to the way the gov't is run and it doesn't really benefit the people and their democratic rights in any way at all.

&gt;There is something strange going on in Poland and it is just amazing considering all the thing this country went through. That is all I am saying.

I'm not sure you understand. The net effect it's describing refers to income groups -- it's not talking about a net positive effect on a household level, it's describing a beneficial effect on an class while noting that a minority do sometimes end up losing out.

&gt; Also it's proposed solution is to just give people welfare which is hardly a good solution as it means an increased tax burden for the average person and the globalist corporations rarely pay taxes.

1. If you'd read the article, you might have noticed that it's not referring to welfare in the sense of a socially informed program, but rather in the sense of household level well being.

2. The article explicitly mentions a stark decrease in consumer prices and supply surges that compensate for the tax burden.

4638,"Using Chernobyl as an example shows where you're coming from. Uninformed. What they did in Chernobyl was experiment with the reactor, no one is proposing THAT.

&gt;Neither is 100% nuclear so what's the point?

It actually is, but we don't want that. We want to eventually go fully renewable at some time in the future. The question is how do we get to that point, preferably IMHO without raising carbon emissions.

&gt;No, the latter is not an option. Both nuclear and renewables have most of their cost in fixed form, so both want to run as often as possible. Neither is going to back down in case of overproduction, their costs are already paid, so we'll get gluts of electricity at some point and the inability to supply at others because neither are flexible enough. Build nuclear, and you still need flexible plants, most likely gas if hydro is not available.

Hydro is possible in our country, but only for a minor fraction. At the moment, the big plants basically are operated as batteries: pump water up with excess current and generate electricity by letting it run out when there's a shortage. There's some additional minor generation using watermills on rivers, but that's about it, and capacity there is limited (especially when you want to conserve the river's flora and fauna).

I think you're also focussing here too much on maximum efficiency. Cutting on carbon dioxide emissions is worth the cost of not running at maximum efficiency, but it's not worth the cost of getting frequent outages. 

&gt;That's not how it works, as explained above. Nuclear does not have an easy time to load follow, it's technically hard, and if to the extent they can it does reduce their capacity factor, and hence, given their fixed capital costs, increases the price. A nuclear plant that load follows and effectively runs at half capacity has appr. double the cost.

It's not easy, but it's not impossible either, that's the point. Again, this is a political choice, and I think it can be justified just by the fact that carbon emissions in the non-nuclear scenario WILL rise.

&gt;In addition the investment dynamics are different: with nuclear behemoths lurking on the electricity market, desperate to recoup at least some of their costs, they'll make it harder to invest in renewables. Renewables drive out gas pretty quickly; a large share of gas on the market is a standing invitation for renewable investors to come make some profit.

Profit, at the cost of at least temporarily raising our carbon emissions. I agree you can justify that choice, but not if you think climate change is an urgent problem.",,/r/europe/comments/bvvaxx/a_quiet_revolution_sweeps_europe_as_greens_become/epyh1wi/,Squalleke123,1559634261

4669,"&gt; The problem is that how the EU regulations for secession work is that you first agree to secede and only then negotiate the details after already having made the decision which is absurd.

It's not EU regulation, it's from the treaties: EU common commercial policy says that the EU has exclusive competence to negotiate for its members on trade matters, furthermore the EU can only negotiate trade deals with third countries. When A50 is activated the UK is still part of the EU commercial policy nor is it a third country. That means the UK has to leave first before the gritty trade negotiations can actually begin.

The problem here, and this has been a very consistent problem in British politics, is that the British people weren't properly informed which means their expectations on what is achievable isn't realistic. To make matters worse the British media never corrected these lies or unrealistic expectations, so these unrealistic expectations are now baked in everyone's minds. Another good example of this is the 39 billion the UK is going to pay the EU, a lot of British will still insist the money is or should be tied to the future trade deal but it's money the UK owe to the EU. Or to rewind the clock a bit Cameron's renegotiation everyone on the British genuinely expected Cameron would be able to end free movement of people. It was never on the cards.

Denying it to them wouldn't really help them rehabilitate so it would only cost the state more money. It also creates a slippery slope - at which point should a citizen be deemed not worthy of help? ISIS yea, but there's plenty other grey areas where this might lead and it will only take away rights from innocent people.

And while many were expelled, many more fled willingly, with the expectation of returning after Israel had been destroyed.  The Palestinians refused the deal, gambling that they could take everything.  They lost that gamble.

4872,"&gt; It's the bigger issue facing Europe. We are wealthy enough to deal with most negative effects of climate change on European citizens certainly for the short term.

It really isn't. If climate change isn't properly curbed, we're going to see massive food shortages that will be felt throughout all first world nations. It's also absurd to prioritize migration over climate change when uncurbed climate change is going to result in massive numbers of refugees rushing into more developed nations.

This is precisely what I mean when I say that people aren't educated enough on the matter -- a huge portion of the population doesn't seem to grasp just how horrendous the consequences of climate change are going to get, and how it will affect the world at large. If we continue as we have been, we are going to see billions displaced.

Worried about the economy? Wait until you see how things are going to look when the combined forces of agricultural upheaval, mass divestment, and unprecedented mass migration crash the global market. Have faith in law and order? Wait until we're one delayed transitional appropriation away from a majority of the European population going hungry.

The only way to avoid all that is to take drastic action, and that won't happen unless we make the fight against climate change our #1 priority.

4908,"&gt; Using an extremely specific meaning of ""trafficked"" which excludes almost all people trafficked.

Using the legal definition, as did the &gt;10k numbers. This is comparing German numbers to German numbers without any change in laws. 

&gt; &gt; If the choice is badly paid truck driver or well-paid sex worker, a significant number might just choose sex work.

&gt; Then why don't they?

They do. That's the point. 

&gt; 90% of legal prostitutes don't file taxes. Either they make barely any money, or they are avoiding tax. Why would they avoid tax? Perhaps their business isn't actually as legal and innocent as you would want to think.

First on: Source. Second, it might be a side gig, [particularly as students](http://www.studienkolleg-zu-berlin.de/files/ProjektEuropa_nebenjob_prostitution.pdf), and thus be below the reporting threshold -- either below the legal limit, or below what the tax offices can detect as the rest of what you file looks sensible enough. Thirdly: At least in Germany practically all sex workers are self-employed due to the strict labour laws (it's impossible for a boss of a prostitute to actually give work orders, much unlike if you're a truck driver). Tough luck avoiding taxes when you're self-employed, the tax office will just assume rather high earnings if you don't report. 

----

Lastly, and I'm going to leave this conversation if you don't answer this one:

4909,"**Spain**

1. **European elections has coincided with municipal** (townhall, major) **and autonomic** (regional parlaments and presidents) **elections**. There is kind of a game of thrones between the different parties. In Spain, when you dont get the majority of the votes, it's possible to create alliances with other parties to construct mixed goverments. So, knowing that, you vote also thinking about the possible coalitions. I've voted for the **Left party (Podemos**) hoping they are stronger enough to force **Socialdemocrats (PSOE**) to make real reforms. The thing is that, now, all the spanish parties are having conversations, looking for ideological intersection (in the left-wing) or establishing alliances that could satisfy each other in the distribution of the power (in the right-wing), always in that ''rapport de pouvoir'' mood.

2. **Ciudadanos** (the **ALDE** party in Spain) is reticent to become a regional ally of the **Partido Socialista Obrero Español** (the Socialdemocrat party in Spain) cause they have been constructing their political discours against them and against Catalonia along the last months, and they 've won many many votes because of it. That has complicated also the possible alliance between **Partido Popular** (**European PPE**) and **Ciudadanos**, cause now Ciudadanos are stronger enough to -maybe- win the spanish PPE in the next elections; eventhough they will finilly become regional allys

3. Bad results for the **Partido Popular (PPE**), but probably they'll get Madrid just as a symbolic victory (they are alredy talking with Ciudadanos and Vox so they can make the coalition).

3. Very bad results for **VOX** (**the extreme right-wing party**). They 've nothing, just a few little redneck's villages in the south, no townhalls, no regions, and just 20 deputies in the parlament, which represents the 7% of it (there are 350 deputies in the Congreso de los Diputados).

4. **Socialdemocrats** has won in the Europeans elections, and almost in all the spanish regions. In the townhall of Madrid, the Major Manuela Carmena, a reference for the **Left Wing Party (Podemos)**, will probably leave, just because of a couple of thousands of votes.  :-(

5. Bad results for **Podemos** (**left wing party**); cause, due to the entry of VOX (the extreme right-wing party), everybody has voted to PSOE so the can concentrate the votes in just one of the left-wing parties. Mais bon, ça va, they will support the PSOE in the regions and the townhalls, so i hope they'll make them turn left. :-P

If you can read German or translator of your choice, plus calculator you see to 2016 not much has changed of Muslim born Germans.


But I still dislike going after kill count and going after. I mean this graph is on top on your deadlist terror attacks list.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_Europe#/media/File:Terrorist_Attacks_in_the_EU_by_Affiliation.png

don't understand me wrong, I think radical Islam is a problem and it is still in the top 10 topics in Germany, but it's way down to other topic.

It get's overblown and to the terror that the RAF  did it's minor. This one big successful attack and some Minor are not that worrying, if all attacks on refugee camps were listed as right wing terrorism as it should, I could argue that Nazi Germany is back again.

It's a problem, but saying all Muslim are terrorist and going that far right wing route, will go nowhere in a to solution.  

I served with Muslim to defend Germany and the USA. How do explain that and he wants to get children.
Should I shoot him? Gas him? We killed more Jews, than we have Muslims. Should I shoot my Syrian refugees neighbors, who invite us over to dinner sometimes. Or the other neighbors, which gave my children presents. I mean they have 4 children and I only two.  
I mean there is a nice concrete building perfectly for shooting people. It's a tradition in my town with have a Mass grave with 7000 KZ-prisoners in my town of 16 000 + other Vicitms of Nazi Area, would add right into the legacy of my town. 

Saying Islamistic terrorism is okay is worrying is okay. Saying Migration and integration is a problem okay. Giving statistic how many Muslim we have and how many children we have is going in a wrong direction, especially if going to round then to the negative way. 

If you instead of counting how many Muslim are born in Germany, you showed how much Turkey and Saudi Arabia are radicalizing our Muslims or how in some Regions like Berlin or NRW the integration process is very bad. I would have agreed with you. But blame on Religious affiliations with a broad direction is not enough. Not every Muslim is a Salafist as not every Christian is a fanatic Evangelical.

Bad foreign Influence and failed Integration with Muslim is the biggest problem. Muslim migration to West-Europe started far earlier than the terror attacks in 2000s. Why was the RAF the terror organisation during that time and not the Turkish Muslim migrants. 
Why are the Syrians, our biggest Migrant group during the Migrant crisis, mostly the best integrated group of all of them. Even against Christian African refugees. 


Sorry for this jumpy Wall of text, but I'm drunk and had already a political discourse this evening.

My problem is not what you want to say, but your Argument. I can see your point, but your arguing is right wring cringy shit. 
Radical Muslim are a problem, there are points showing that. Showing how bad integrated foreign influenced Muslim, who fucking can't read their own holy book think, that the favorite past time is to blow themselves up against any humans. 


Bad Integration, foreign Influences from countries, who should fuck themselves and reducing the police has more to do with the problem, than fucking Muslim Birthrates. Against the first ones, you could do a lot and against the second one, a second holocaust is the only solution I heard and I'm not going with that one.

Also crime is a bigger problem with our migrants, than terrorism especially the so called Libanese clan are a bigger topic than terror in Germany.

4988,"Several reasons.


1st: the country was formed as a new democratic national state, and not a resurrection of the old multiethnic monarchy that it was, therefore using monarchist symbols as our flag would have been inappropriate, especially after ww1, when monarchies were dropping dead left and right in favor of democracies.


2nd: the symbol was too complex to mass produce at the time. When we declared our independence during ww1 in 1918, the country had no means to mass produce a complex flag such as this, because most of our country was devastated during the war, as well as being drawn into new wars with the bolsheviks, poles, and the leftover russian whites. And even disregarding all that, most of our country was very undeveloped and rural, with feudalism being abolished only about 50ish years earlier, and only a fraction of the popilation living in cities.


3rd: the horse flag contains a lot of red color, and at the time, it would have been very easy to confuse us with our enemies, the bolsheviks.


All of these things lead to a council that decided to base our flag on the colors foind in our folk clothing, so at first we had a two color flag like Poland or Ukraine that consisted of just green and red colors, but it was quickly observed that this kind of flag looked really dreary so someone suggested we add some yellow to brighten it up a bit.


The flag was quite unpopular during the interwar years, and there were constant proposals to change it into something else. [One such proposa](http://www.epaveldas.lt/recordImageSmall/LNB/C10002443147?exId=425464&amp;seqNr=2) was successful in 1940, but we were annexed by the Soviet Union before it could be adopted. This is where things started changing. The Soviets, naturally, banned our old yellow,green,red tricolor flag as a symbol of the old ""fascistic dictatorial regime"" and replaced it at first with a generic red soviet flag and in the 1950s, with [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_the_Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic.svg). The old, formerly hated tricolor suddenly became a beloved symbol of resistence and lithuanian-ness itself for every person that was discontent with the communist regime. It was then flown in various crucial independence events such as the [Baltic way](http://lsveikata.lt/upload/articles_images/9229/def/baltijos_kelias.jpg) or the [1991 soviet coup attempt](https://austrian.economicblogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Funeral-For-Fallen-Lithuanian-01-1991.jpg), where hundreds of thousands of people stood unarmed against soviet tanks, some being crushed. This has permanently cemented this flag as part of our culture, making it irreplaceable at this point, even though some are still unhappy with it for various reasons.


But the horse flag is pretty widely used as well. It's the oficial flag of the lithuanian state. It's flown over the presidential palace as well as in countless parks, landmarks and private home yards. It's a common thing to see it in sport events as well. So we have the best of both worlds really.",Semigallian,/r/europe/comments/bw8r9q/lithuanian_flag_placed_instead_of_the_pride_flag/epxmy31/,Ziemgalis,1559605180

5017,"The question of ""feeling European"" being equivalent to feeling American or Canadian within their respective unions is still absurd. Go on r/askeurope and browse the multiple threads where this question has been asked, the overwhelming majoirty are still quite apathetic about it. Americans would volunteer by the millions and die fighting to protect their countrymen in another state. Europeans meanwhile, are hesitant to even honour NATO's article 5 to defend their fellow Europeans (The Baltics, in reach of Russia, always being the obvious topic of these scenarios). Hell, there was a genocide going on in Bosnia only 20 years ago, and the Dutch and British forces infamously did absolutely nothing to stop it. You're living in another planet if you think a Swede and a Bulgarian feel the same sort of kinship and willingness to defend each other that an Albertan and a Ontarian feel. There is a reason why Canadians and Americans call themselves such, whereas Europeans use our own national demonyms (German, Scottish, Bulgarian, etc.)


&gt;The problem with UK in my view is that they never really got over the end of the Empire and somehow think the 70s where great....


Oh ffs not this wannabe psychoanalyst shit again. Cant anyone in the EU accept that maybe some people wanted to get out of the EU before it centralizes more? The ""*ever closer union*"" line is pretty blatant. Everyone always complained about how the UK treated it as a commercial thing rather than ""believing in the greater European project"", well now that mistake is being rectified, the UK wont obstruct the Charlemagne hype train anymore, so what are the complaints even over? 


Besides, the fact that *we* are accused of ""clinging to empire"" is laughable. Algeria, Vietnam, Indonesia, Angola and Mozambique had to fight actual wars of independence to become free. We left Indis in 1947 and left virtually all of Africa without any fighting (Kenya being the exception, but that was not an attempt at keeping Kenya, which wasnt particularly important compared to all the other African nations).

5024,"Fox business’ and Forbes’ arbitrary, general rankings are absolutely meaningless. I’d like to see the articles though so I can at least laugh at them. So according to you and those articles it would be wise for me to open a steel plant in the UK, since it is such a great place for “business”. Why do unicorn start ups even matter so much and how are they going to save us and what does that have to do with discussion? It would be much easier for these start ups to sell their products in a European market than anywhere else anyway. That’s like something you would use as an argument against Brexit.

Also you are correct when you say that the UK is a service-based economy. Our three main service are financial services and professional services (primarily) and education. All three were already hit by Brexit and especially the financial industry will suffer a lot more in a case of a no deal Brexit.

I don’t really understand what exactly do you mean by modern economy? You never really specify that and I have never seen any scientific journal dealing with “modern economies”. According to what criteria do you place the polish economy on par with the Venezuelan one? Why are you saying that the Australian economy is more “modern” than the US one and what do you mean by that? 

Also there is no more “miracle” in Australia. They are consistently running a primary deficit, growth is very low now. I don’t see why they are something so remarkable. [source](https://tradingeconomics.com/australia/indicators)  [Also Australia’s main trading partner is China](http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/?country=14&amp;partner=undefined&amp;product=undefined&amp;productClass=SITC&amp;startYear=1975&amp;target=Partner&amp;year=2017). So you are the one who is ignorant. Where are those high product standards you are talking about and how are British firms going to compete with Chinese ones? [Exactly the same goes for NZ](http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/?country=166&amp;partner=undefined&amp;product=undefined&amp;productClass=SITC&amp;startYear=1975&amp;target=Partner&amp;tradeDirection=import&amp;year=2017). Both of these countries literally import twice as much from Germany compared to the UK.

I mentioned India and SA as a bit of a joke but FYI these are the countries that are by the far the UK’s most important trade partners out of the ones you mentioned (excluding the US). As far as “commonwealth interests” go, India is much closer to, say, Russia than the UK.

What do you mean when you say we are more similar to some countries than to other ones. I don’t really feel Strayan or American. If you mean economically then you are even more ignorant than I thought. If two countries produce the same thing why should they trade? Anyway, say, [Straya imports few of the things that the UK exports.](http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/?country=14&amp;partner=undefined&amp;product=undefined&amp;productClass=SITC&amp;startYear=1975&amp;target=Product&amp;tradeDirection=import&amp;year=2017) 

Also the FTA certainly has “junior” partners. An FTA does not just allow free trade in general for all products and markets like the EEA does. It allows free trade for certain products and/or services and maybe labour too. Just compare the NAFTA and the EEA. Which products and which services depends on the what the bargaining power and the interests of the different parties are. E.g. if the US and the UK sign a FTA, the US may demand that the UK allows free trade in the healthcare sector (which the issue the initial post is about) but will not in turn allow free trade of, say, professional services or cars or gold or whatever other thing the UK would profit (and the US lose) the most from exporting, but instead give a smaller concession, such as allowing the free trade of gold products. The UK would accept because, even with such a shitty and one-sided deal, it will be better off than before, but the US gets the most from this agreement.",,/r/europe/comments/bw8drx/donald_trump_visits_the_uk_megathread_live_updates/epxojbn/,SavvyDawi,1559606470

5035,"&gt;\[...\] if we don't do anything about climate change all we'll have is right wing smugness on top of the ruins of our once advanced society

Doing something against climate change doesn't mean that one *has to be* left wing. I just don't want a party with massive socialist tendencies and a brutal lack of economic knowledge and (in part) rational conclusions to run my country only because they are green. A more pro-capitalist, less contra top performer and pro entrepreneur green party would be absolutely possible and I am convinced that this kind of party would do it better with less ideology and more expertise concerning economy and science.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you are irritated when I talk about ""ideology"" - the ideology I mean is not the belief in climate change but the way they are dealing with and reacting to it. Especially when it comes to nuclear physics and nuclear power plants they are - sorry - a complete mess ... Uranium is, in the end, a fossil fuel but they would be an ideal short- to mid-term solution to reduce CO2 emissions (they are not neutral but very good because of their efficiency!) and area-consumption (in comparison to coal mining, for instance; repositories included) in the energy sector extremely fast without driving the electricity to inacceptable highs (we are #1 worldwide in Germany when it comes to electricity prices!). Now, try to convince a green politician to believe that... this is what I mean with ""ideology"" and a lack of scientific knowledge (the latter, to be honest, is far less existent in the outer right space... just aside ;) ).

&amp;#x200B;

The severe problem with a lack of economical expertise is that it is unrealistic since the EU is not isolated from the world. When the Greens are regulating companies much more and intend to tax top performers more heavily (wealth tax in particular since it requires founders to pay out dividends or even sell shares from their *own company* to pay the taxes, thus reducing the amount of money to invest in technology and higher risks) this doesn't attract innovative founders but we need them *especially* because of climate change. E.g. when ""artificial intelligence"" (btw: No, we ... by far ... don't have a real A.I. yet.) is regulated too hard people will found their companies abroad... and then? We will have to rely on foreign servers and technologies in general which are running in foreign countries with less ""green"" standards. Economy simply doesn't work that way and even the EU won't be able to change this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you can understand what I mean. I am not against means to fight climate change in general but in several cases our Greens are too ideological and are lacking knowledge about economy.

&gt;Trash separation at the household level is not wrong. Without this step further recycling would be much more expensive.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Germany there is a system that forces producers of one-way plastics to pay a fee. This fee has to be ramped up dramatically in order to ramp up the real recycling rate, since real recycling in Germany is expensive. The rest should be forced by law to be burned. People have to face reality that a lot of plastic trash can't be recycled even with advanced recycling facilities/intensive manual labour.

5106,"I think you have confused some things. 

&gt; Do you realise Turkey did not sign the UNCLOS convention and do not recognise the 12 nautical mile territorial waters in Aegean sea? We do not recognise the Aegean sea as Greek sea. Violating and not recognising are different things.

There is no 12 nautical mile territorial waters, Greek has 6 nautical miles since Turkey has a casus belli on Greece in case it expands its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles. The FIR is 10 nautical miles, which Turkey does not recognize since its different than the 6 miles. Greece claims that it is within its rights to have the FIR to 10 miles and the only reason that the territorial waters is 6 miles is the casus belli which does not extend to airspace.

Also there are violations. Planes flying over inhabited islands are exactly that.

&gt; Do Thracian Turks went insurgency against Greek goverment so you are worrying about Turkish funding?

Yeah they kind of do. In their gatherings they have flags of the ""Indipendent government of Western Thrace"". They talk about a turkish minority, which Greece denies since people of turkic origin are not the only muslims in the area, and in fact Pomaks have already said that the party does not express them. Of course every individual has the right to self-determination, but this right does not extend on a communal level. 

&gt; Which part of Lausanne violated? 

I don't know what the OP refers to in particular, but the Instabul pogroms against greeks makes the discussion about violation dull. Only around 2000 greeks remain, while Greece with all its flaws have protected the muslim minority.

5187,"&gt; With a GRR government

I stated multiple times now that this would only work if the FDP was a socialliberal party.

&gt; Black and Green

which is more or less GroKo in Green.

Neither of these make any sense as minority governments.

Why are you conveniently leaving out the 2 minority governments that I proposed? The Right Wing Alliance would undoubtedly be more to the right than GroKo and Ampel backed by Linke more to the left and more liberal.

&gt; Yes, the SPD sucks, but they had an impact on the laws that were made, and they have pushed a lot of things to the left

Yes but only ever in a way that was rather convenient for the CDU too. If the SPD was still as left as before Schröder the coalition would have long fallen apart. Their self-reclaimed successes are not much to show for for 10 years in government.

&gt; the government will have to change to not lose their majority [...] Proposed laws always end up somewhere near centre to achieve the necessary majority

They will lose their majority no matter what. And policies don't always end up near the centre, they do so sometimes but hardly always. In Denmark for instance the government just fired 20 % of teachers, hardly a very centre policy.

&gt;The Danes can often choose from two or three options to find a majority without having to water down proposed laws

In practise the options are limited in a very similar way. Among the parties currently in parliament Enhedslisten and SF would only realisticly be part of a left-wing government. Konservative and LA only in a right-wing government. DF could potentially back a centre left-government but this is entirely because they are a different party than the AfD and sometimes left on economics (if the AfD was like that the same would be possible in Germany). Socialdemocrats and Venstre could go into a grand coalition but otherwise they are also relegated to their specific bloqs. This leaves Radikale Venstre and Alternativet (and offshot of Radikale Venstre) as the 2 parties that could back either a left or right government and Alternativet doesn't seem likely in a right-wing alliance. In Germany FDP and Greens fill the same roles already in reality. So they have more or less the same options: bloq alliance, GroKo (+the most centre parties), Greens supporting a right-wing government or FDP supporting a left-wing government. That the Danes have so many options is an illusion.

&gt; I would like to see that system too in Germany, but our political landscape is not fit for that system

Well, lower the 5 % threshold to 2 % and write negative parliamentarism into the constitution. It's actually more stable than what we have now.

&gt; A GRR minority government 

Can we please get over this. I suggested 2 minority governments that could work. GRR would only work with a majority as is.

&gt; You would rather have the AfD involved in the policy making than the Greens in a coalition with the CDU?

Yes, absolutely. The past 14 years have been about clinging to an unstable status quo and if people vote for a right-wing government let em taste the medicine they so desperately desire. Greens/CDU would achieve nothing and be another wasted 4 years, so lets get on with the inevitable sooner rather than later. 

&gt; I would say that of all minority governments a coalition between the CDU and the Greens would have the best chances

It wouldn't work because they have really different policies. How do you intend to bridge a gap like [this](https://imgur.com/a/snJiz4Z) (EU parliament but still pretty telling)? and then you also rely on support from other parties. There's a reason minority governments are build around parties with similar platforms.

&gt; Leaving the EU

This is what Enhedslisten wanted until shortly before the EU elections for instance. Linke does not support such a policy and neither does Melenchon in actuality. His plan was excactly to use it as a threat to be able to change the EU, not to actually leave. I think it's a very poor plan but Macron's plan of getting support from the german government by doing excactly the reforms they would want didn't work either, they just shat on all of his proposals (SPD too mind you, they had every oppurtunity to make it a big deal, they didn't).

&gt; support for dictators

All parties do that when it's convenient to them sadly. However they are divided on Putin and on Maduras they only rejected the foreign preasure afaik which was nothing preposterous excactly (you could agree or you could disagree but it's more a question of not interferring in foreign elections here).",For a Europe of the Regions!,/r/europe/comments/bw7nae/german_government_could_collapse_over_resignation/epx2awg/,tobias_681,1559590350

5201,"&gt;No, the false premise is that those 'ethnic groups' aren't all American.

Never said that.

&gt;Americans have a hard time with this--but they are all American culture. Having more in common than they do different. United under culture that you apparently can't see, but Europeans (and others) can clearly.

Irish whites are the largest ethnic group in Ireland and they make up 82,2% of the population. By comparison German-Americans are the largest ethnic group in the US and they make up only 13,26% of the US's population. Our situations are not at all comparable. 

&gt;Conversely, the ethnic groups in Ireland are REAL ethnic groups. We don't have African Americans, we have Africans. Or German Americans. We have Germans. And French. And British. And Italian. And so on. Same is true in many European countries because of this great thing we have called the EU.

And even when it comes to other ethnic groups, the cultural, ethnic and religious proximity is much higher in the EU compared to the US. As soon as this proximity decreases, tensions start to appear. We've seen it slowly emerge with various Muslim ethnic groups increasing in size in several EU countries. 

&gt;Yet even with this diversity, we somehow manage not to have the problems America has. This is not the case because we lack diversity. It is because we have greater respect, tolerance, social supports, cooperation, and consideration.

I find it astonishing how an Irish of all people can say that. You do know the Catholics and the Protestants were still at each other's throats just a few decades ago in Ireland, right?",,/r/europe/comments/bw8drx/donald_trump_visits_the_uk_megathread_live_updates/epx2j2q/,Fayolunipo,1559590501

The most productive aspect of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement is that it's a commentary on (and the logical end point of) utilitarianism: If the ultimate goal is to bring about the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people in the most efficient way possible, then we should indeed opt out of procreating any further, because it's the fastest way to spare countless future humans the gruesome fate of existing in this world with all its misery, pain and suffering; and since every one of us is going to die anyway at some point, nobody would be worse off. That a compelling argument.

But please note that I'm not a ""extinctionist"" myself, because in the end, our phase-out would also mean that we deprive countless future humans of the possibility of experiencing joy, creativity and consciousness, which is regrettable on a *cosmic* scale because for all we know, we're the only beings capable of those things.

5344,"&gt;It is the same thing. You are only showing your bias by claiming that Brexit is somehow the natural state of affairs and a narrow majority for it is enough, but a narrow majority against it is not.

I'm not suggesting that brexit is neutral state of affairs. It absolutely isn't, its a massive change.

What I am saying is that if someone legislates for you, is able to regulate and acts on your behalf in important areas of policy, they need the consent of the people being governed. It's a fairly fundamental thing, absent that I don't understand how you could suggest it's a reasonable position. And that applies to the EU as much as it applies to Scotland, Northern Ireland, (previously Ireland..), the Falklands, Gibraltar, Ukraine, Taiwan, Palestine and indeed Catalonia.

&gt;No, I think the Daily Mail hired them because they knew that their methodology would give the result they wanted.

Those that qualify for subsidized housing are not rational to begin with. Addiction and mental illnesses are direct contradictions to Rational choice theory.

Theory supports your statement, sure, but empirical evidence does not. Empirical evidence shows that collecting benefits for a basic lifestyle goes out of fashion really fast, i.e. those that are ""unemployed by choice"" don't really exist past the short-term. Instead, it's generally only those that genuinely cannot get out of a limbo of real problems that end up being long term takers. 

However, if we completely forget the above, then sure this system is very unfair.

5472,"&gt;The problem is Greeks claim cultural dominion over many of those groups as sort of a classical era sub-ethnicity. They see many of those groups as cadet branches of, or progenitors of ancient Greece

There are also some stories like how ""the native population"" suddenly disappears into thin air as soon as greeks come. I remember reading about it about a Pontic town but can't remember the name. The native population suddenly ""left"" as soon as Greeks came according to them. And the Greeks also have a story about how Perseus singlehandedly massacred all the ""native"" inhabitants of Isauria with Medusa's head. 

Greeks also never mention Ancient Anatolians in great detail. They only mention Lydians (because they invented gold coin and they were a huge kingdom). And Herodotus mentions them and Herodotus is usually full of bs when it comes to mentioning other peoples.

5473,"GroKo means a coalition between the 2 largest parties merely, regardless of which are the 2 largest one - and it will probably become CDU/Greens at this point.

The governments in Denmark are also NEVER stable but it's not such a big deal really. Denmark has negative parliamentarism which makes it easier for minority governments to form but otherwise there are no real fundamental differences. A government doesn't have to sruvive 4 years. If it does for 2 or 3 and gets a few things done that's perfectly fine.

As it currently stands it would be on the conservatives to form a government. If there is a right-wing majority a possible government could be CDU/CSU+FDP with AfD backing (AfD could possibly be swayed with the threat of a left-wing or Green government and could have a word in who becomes chancellor). The other options would be Ampel with Left backing (could be possible if the Left wants to avoid CDU in government) or GRR with FDP backing - which the FDP is probably too right-wing and conservative for. If they were more like Radikale Venstre in Denmark, Neos in Austria, LREM in France or like themselves before 1982 it could work. As of late they have expressed disatisfaction with the CDU though. I wouldn't find it credible if FDP resists every form of government like the AfD and I don't think most of their voters do either.

5550,"&gt;What? It will show you that we take contracts so seriously that we will only sign those that we intend to keep, and refuse to sign those that we know we would later have to break.

The EU budget was **already signed.** Including by the UK (which got a large discount already). 

Article 50 declares that either an agreement has to be reached within 2 years (plus extension) or the leaving country will leave without any treaty.

 In an other comment, I explained why the UK is in debt towards the EU 28. If they leave without an agreement, those debts will default. If that happens, the EU should confiscate British property in Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

The UK is not ""leaving on WTO terms"". WTO terms apply to the trade rules after leaving.

BTW: WTO terms only apply to states the EU does not have trade agreements with. Although China and Russia belong to that group, many medium and smaller economies do have trade agreements.

5553,"&gt;The RBMK reactor in tjernobyl experienced a steam explosion, talking about nuclear explosions make it sound like it is the fallout of a nuclear weapon. Actually the fallout from a nuclear weapon is less dangerous.

The explosion was, in fact, nuclear. Many people might be confused, because nuclear explosion is usually associated with a mushroom cloud and gigantic yields. It does not *need* to have it. What is important is the nature of it - e.g - the source of the energy. By the way, the fallout from a *fission* device is very substantial and is pretty much linear to yield.

&gt;The first ""bang"" that was heard MIGHT have been a local nuclear jet of plasma that shot a hole upwards (With little evidence, source) . A nuclear explosion is an explosion directly relating to the heat evolved from nuclear fission, but the main explosion that blew off the lid and released radiotoxins into the atmosphere was a Steam explosion, i.e. a very rapid boiling of the water, and per definition NOT a nuclear explosion

The study got much the stuff wrong way around. I think the fact that it bases a lot of its analysis on Chernushenko's ideas (which are, let's say, not very accurate) might have been the culprit. In any way, it is known that the sudden steam expansion at 1.23.47-48 led to lifting the lid (Elena scheme), tearing out most of the transfer channels. This led to a sudden release of pressure, decreasing the boiling point but also releasing a great deal of it into the main hall compartment. And only then, at 1.23.49 did the spike of about 700 GJ happen. Was it a steam expansion that carried that energy to do most of the damage? Was it a immediate gasification of central core immediate surroundings? It is hard to say. It is a sort of a chicken and egg dilemma, since one action recursively amplified another, i.e. positive loop. But there is no doubt that the source of the rapid release of energy is a supercritical fuel.

&gt;Using the incorrect terminology for this accident just helps to spread the misinformation that nuclear reactors can behave the same as nuclear weapons, which they do not. In order to achieve a nuclear blast you need to enrich the uranium to about 90 % U-235 (""weapons grade"", although it is possible with lower enrichment it is impractical), or use concentrated Pu-239. Here is the wikipedia page if you are interested

Oh but they can. There is nothing alarmist or sensationalist in it, don't get me wrong. I am very pro-nuclear myself. But the reactors can explode, as a nuclear bomb. The grade only helps to decrease the required threshold and size of both the fuel and reflectors. There are many, many critical u-235 masses in a fully loaded RBMK. Your typical submarine reactors work at ~90% grade fuel. Grade in itself has nothing to do with it. Its the composition and positioning of fuel, moderators and reflectors. Melt it all in a one compact pile, and suddenly you can't ignore prompt neutrons anymore....BOOM!",,/r/europe/comments/bw2bcn/the_heroes_of_chernobyl_who_saved_europe_from/epw8hd7/,Strydwolf,1559569084

5613,"Uh, it's not even negative, it's completely neutral. Nuclear power *could* be used for a portion of the charging, and it would be useful, but ultimately the percentage of the portion between 0% and 100% will be entirely dictated by the shape of the supply over time, by the shape of the non-vehicle demand over time, by the time-of-use pricing schemes enacted, by the practicality of shifting your charging around ([made possible by having lots things like these](https://insideevs.com/news/332283/finland-has-a-genius-charging-solution-for-evs-use-existing-block-heater-poles-video/)), and by the driving patterns and economic patterns of drivers.

It's impossible to predict the percentage now, but I suspect that decreasing prices of opportunistic charging makes it simply less likely that the increase caused by vehicles will be served by nuclear sources, for the very simple reason of those sources being relatively expensive compared to the ""opportunistic"" sources like the occasional overgeneration from wind and solar power, which can even reach negative price levels in some places these days.

Consider this: ČEZ expected guaranteed feed-in tariffs for the expansion of Temelin [between 70 and 100 Euros/MWh](http://www.enviweb.cz/98027). On the other hand, overgeneration in Germany [can already easily bring power price to the level of -30 Euros/MWh.](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/why-power-prices-turn-negative). In context of electric vehicles, assuming 15 kWh/100 km and 5l/100 km of consumption as equivalents for electric and gasoline vehicles, that difference would correspond to the choice between purchasing gasoline for 28 Kč/l (from momentary overgeneration) and 37 Kč/l (from the guaranteed nuclear feed-in). If you've ever observed vehicle owners shopping around for gasoline a mere Czech crown cheaper, explain to me how they would not prefer the former over the latter at almost all times. I consider it impossible.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/bvvo16/europes_green_wave/epw0xvh/,ObnoxiousFactczecher,1559561606
5614,"&gt; Storage in batteries can only last you a day, if you want to store more, diminishing returns will bankrupt you. The poster example of electricity is France with it's nuclear power and electric heating. In winter the energy demand just about doubles due to that. And in winter your solar panels produce the least energy. Use all your battery capacity daily, and you're looking at 10 cents per kwh, only once a week 70 cents, 1 month each year (again peak demand!) 1,20€ per kWh, nobody can afford that.

Batteries are useful for load balancing in short timescales - up to 24 hours - and for this application they are very profitable, as has already been demonstrated in Australia.

&gt; Pumped Hydro, we have already reached capacity for natural places that we can use, and man-made structures are also damn expensive. 

We are not even close to reaching natural capacity. And there are cheap alternatives for when we do, see Fraunhofer's concrete spheres or Dubai's hollow island.

Just like a place i worked at before, with parking spaces for 500 cars. Besides the cost to equip each one (again my long term goal is solving global warming, not only reducing CO2 emissions) you also have to think about the electric grid that would be required to support such a parking space. You really need an entire transformation station with direct access to the high voltage power lines for that.

A house in Germany is usually connected with 3 phase power with a total transmission capacity of 69 kW (this is the normal upper limit) Meaning if every car needs to charge 15kWh for 100km of daily driving, with 1 of those lines you can charge about 40 in a given 9 hour period. So for those 500 parking spaces you need 13 69kW lines, or to make it easier a single 1000KW power line.

The true enemies are and have always been those that knowing the full consequences of climate change, realize that the only ""valid"" tactic is to defect and consume and store as many resources as possible before the incoming climate collapse.

Of course the region is poor and remote, so that plays a part too, but one could make the argument that in trying to counter leftist Kurdish nationalism, Turkey has at partly made more likely a situation where Kurdish nationalist parties will be able to consistently get in to parliament (because of a greater share of the population being Kurd's) despite the highest electoral threshold in the world, and Kurdish nationalism will play a large part in Turkish politics .

Peer-reviewed research shows renewables are better:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629618300598

""Contrary to a persistent myth based on erroneous methods, global data show that renewable electricity adds output and saves carbon faster than nuclear power does or ever has.""

It is also not remotely economical, as of the latest LCOE (levelized cost of energy) nuclear is over 3x more expensive than wind and solar. This means a given dollar figure of investment will give 3x as much decarbonization if invested into wind and solar instead of nuclear.

https://www.lazard.com/media/450436/rehcd3.jpg

Nuclear has never even been economically viable, it is never been done, anywhere without massive government support:

""Most revealing is the fact that nowhere in the world, where there is a competitive market for electricity, has even one single nuclear power plant been initiated. Only where the government or the consumer takes the risks of cost overruns and delays is nuclear power even being considered.""

https://htpr.cnet.com/p/?u=http://i.bnet.com/blogs/subsidies-2.bmp&amp;h=Y8-1SgM_eMRp5d2VOBmNBw

And after all the subsidies nuclear has received, it is still not viable without subsidies, meanwhile wind and solar have many examples of subsidy-free projects

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/subsidy-free-solar-comes-to-the-uk

With the overall lower subsidies to the renewables industry, they have transitioned to being viable without in a very short period of time, compared to nukes which literally remain subsidy junkies 50 years after their first suckle at the government teat.

Renewables even make better use of subsidy dollars; the same amount of subsidy invested in renewables vs nuclear will give many times more energy as a result.

""Global reported investment for the construction of the four commercial nuclear reactor projects (excluding the demonstration CFR-600 in China) started in 2017 is nearly US$16 billion for about 4 GW. This compares to US$280 billion renewable energy investment, including over US$100 billion in wind power and US$160 billion in solar photovoltaics (PV). China alone invested US$126 billion, over 40 times as much as in 2004. Mexico and Sweden enter the Top-Ten investors for the first time. A significant boost to renewables investment was also given in Australia (x 1.6) and Mexico (x 9). Global investment decisions on new commercial nuclear power plants of about US$16 billion remain a factor of 8 below the investments in renewables in China alone. ""

p22 of https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/IMG/pdf/20180902wnisr2018-lr.pdf

The results of this is that in 2017 there was over 150 GW of wind and solar coming online, but nuclear:

neo-liberalism, according to the wiki, is someone who is a liberal (who believes in restricted government) who believes that government should ""create and maintain markets"", basically, a paradox.

5771,"&gt;No, Dyatlov did not do everything by the book, or close to that. But the book was shit, and what he did against SOPs probably did not aggravate the accident. Moreover, he put himself in harm's way when trying to fix things, that's how he got irradiated. It is indeed wrong of the HBO series to omit that.

That's not true. From the report you link.

&gt;In reviewing information made available since the Post-Accident Review
Meeting, INSAG judges that factors leading to the accident are to be found in the safety features of the design, the actions of the operators, and the general safety and regulatory framework. There is a need to shift the balance of perception so as to emphasize more the deficiencies in the safety features of the design which were touched on in INSAG-1, and to recognize the problems conferred by the framework within which plant operation was carried out. **However, INSAG remains of the view that in many respects the actions of the operators were unsatisfactory.**

&gt;The weight given in INSAG-1 in 1986 to the Soviet view presented at the
Vienna meeting, which laid blame almost entirely on actions of the operating
staff, is thereby lessened. Certain actions by operators that were identified in
INSAG-1 as violations of rules were in fact not violations. Yet INSAG remains
of the opinion that critical actions of the operators were most ill judged. **As
pointed out in INSAG-1, the human factor has still to be considered as a major
element in causing the accident.** The poor quality of operating procedures and
instructions, and their conflicting character, put a heavy burden on the operat-
ing crew, including the Chief Engineer. It has also to be noted that the type
and amount of instrumentation as well as the control room layout made it
difficult to detect unsafe reactor conditions. **However, operating rules were
violated, and control and safety rods were placed in a configuration that would
have compromised the emergency protection of the reactor even had the rod
design not been faulty on the ground of the positive scram effect mentioned
earlier. Most reprehensibly, unapproved changes in the test procedure were
deliberately made on the spot, although the plant was known to be in a condi-
tion very different from that intended for the test.**

The RBMK design was crap and the regulations terrible, but the fact remains that Dyatlov directly contributed to the accident. He was the person who authorized the ad hoc test procedure change, and the person who authorized the unsafe control rod withdrawal.",,/r/europe/comments/bw2bcn/the_heroes_of_chernobyl_who_saved_europe_from/epvwibr/,10ebbor10,1559555283

5792,"Southern Spain here. We get hot wind from the Sahara a couple times a Summer. The air burns even at night or in the shadow. It also doesn't even move. 

In normal hot days, keep house hermetic unless there's some movement in the air. Keep plenty of beverages at hand. Gazpacho is great.

As soon as the air is moving, or the Sun goes a bit down, open EVERYTHING to cool down the house as much as possible.

When the time to sleep comes, keep stuff open. If too desperate, go lay on the floor. We usually have stone floors. My father slept so many times on a towel because it was too hot in bed.

For days with the Sahara wind, keep everything closed. You'll hate everything after a couple days make the air at your home loaded and just too warm, but the air outside is even worse. Don't worry about not being able to sleep or your bed being uncomfortably drenched in vinegar - smelling sweat. After a couple nights you just fall asleep because you're tired. 

Also avoid electronics, lights, and your general presence on your sleeping room. Fucking lamps make a huge difference

So basically get AC in your room or get ready to die. 

 The Sáhara wind usually dissipates after anything between 3-20 days. And sometimes it comes back before you have had time to cool down your home.

Other bonuses of Summer are putting fresh clothes on and have them full of sweat before you've had time to leave home, needing to take the long route everywhere because you need to go through streets in the shadow (of you need to go out around midday), and God forbid you must use public transport (and beg there aren't any obese people aboard because the WHOLE FUCKING BUS becomes unbreathable space, to the point of people sometimes gasping for air after off)",,/r/europe/comments/bw0o6l/weather_in_europe_today_2_june_2019/epvrw7s/,Nomapos,1559547382

5815,"renewables are too dependant on external factors, like weather or seasons, for example wind power not working that great in summer, or solar not being that great in winter, which is problematic since energy demand in those times of the year actually increases, because people are using air conditioners or are heating their homes.

here is interesting article for you, it talks about storage capacity that would be needed, but read it whole, it also mentions that keeping nuclear would significantly decrease how much storage is needed:
https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20022019/100-percent-renewable-energy-battery-storage-need-worst-case-polar-vortex-wind-solar

as you can see even pro-renewables scientists agree that that grid would need a LOT more storage capacity if you want to go 100 carbon-free, they also agree that nuclear would make achieving that goal easier and faster.

also about nuclear I want to add that developing nuclear power further would actually help with its problems:
- Improved operating safety features, such as (depending on design) avoidance of pressurized operation, automatic passive (unpowered, uncommanded) reactor shutdown, avoidance of water cooling and the associated risks of loss of water (leaks or boiling) and hydrogen generation/explosion and contamination of coolant water.
- In some reactors, the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity, that is, a Closed nuclear fuel cycle(next gen reactor would be helping us remove current nuclear waste).

5824,"&gt; Then there would have been costs for nuclear capacity, or more coal emissions. Look at the nuclear plant at Hinkley Point: they had to agree to give a guaranteed electricity price or the plant wouldn't have been built. That price is higher than the price of renewables. 

You are shifting the conversation and are all over the place. The discussion regarding tax was in the context of the German consumer cost for utilities. 

Also you are implying that externalities are not priced in to the energy cost but that is not true. You cannot arbitrarily chose to only look at the negative externalities and not also consider the positive ones. Making energy accessible and affordable for people of lower income is adding a lot of value that you also would need to consider and which in sum makes the energy with given methods of production more favorable than not having the energy available or making it more expensive to deter emission. 

Here is a chart from the World Bank showing corelation of life expectancy and energy usage per capita.  [http://rameznaam.com/2013/11/14/income-energy-use-and-life-expectancy/](http://rameznaam.com/2013/11/14/income-energy-use-and-life-expectancy/)  I would be almost bold enough to state not only a correlation but also a causation. If you reduce energy usage per capita by making it more expensive you will also very likely have an impact on quality of life and life expectancy.

&gt;No, not at all. The peaks you see are the demand peaks, which happen to be filled mostly by renewables because people are more active during the day. 

The graph does not show demand but production. The peaks and amplitudes are driven by the random production of renewables. They can not be tuned. If you would have a demand driven production the chart would be having a rectangular shape. Going on the site you can chose the timeframe to show production in 2010 and you will see a different shape. If you would go to a similar graph for 2000 you would see how a demand optimized production looks like and it would be clearly a rectangular graph. 

The problem is that when faced with scrutiny you are trying to make physical realities untrue just to serve your cause. This will neither help you in your cause and aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions nor will it have any benefit for anyone. The question should be what a sensible and affordable method should look like that successfully lowers emissions and not standing behind a solution that does not work. In that context I think the French model relying mostly on nuclear is clearly much more favorable than what Germany is doing. In France consumer electricity cost is at 17ct per kWh and the average CO2 emission per capita is almost half of what it is in Germany. So you have only half the price and half the CO2. 

If we are talking about genuine options to improve the situation we need to talk about realistic options. Energy cost in Germany is among the highest in the World and the results are not overwhelming. Here are energy prices in Europe  [https://1-stromvergleich.com/download/electricity-prices-europe-2017/](https://1-stromvergleich.com/download/electricity-prices-europe-2017/) 

Here is CO2 per capita  [https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/10296/economics/top-co2-polluters-highest-per-capita/](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/10296/economics/top-co2-polluters-highest-per-capita/) .

Looking at the 2 charts next to each other and still routing for the German model is in my opinion ignorant.

&gt; ... Do you even know how a grid works? If supply is lower than demand, you get brownouts or blackouts. 

That is exactly my point. The demand looks rectangular but since you cannot tune the prduction of the renewables that generate bells you need to fit the rectangular graph inside of the bell to make sure your grid does not break down. The entire amplitude above the top end of the rectangular graph is overproduction which is mostly driven by renewables. Renewables are fairly unplannable and unreliable in their output and you need to do a lot of flexing to make them fit into the picture. That is the reason why electricity is more expensive in Germany than in almost all countries in Europe except Denmark. That is what the entire dicussion revolves around coming from the unsubstantiated claim that wind is cheaper than coal. My point is that it is only cheaper if we are looking at the energy produced per kWH over life time. However, if we consider that there is a lot of energy that can not be consumed as it is hard or impossible to sync demand and supply, wind is very expensive.",,/r/europe/comments/btxb63/power_generation_by_source_in_eu_countries/epvsabs/,Tomboman,1559548006

5870,"You actually understand **zero** about this topic, so no reason to get upset or make your own claims. I'll try to lay out the most important distinctions between a reactor meltdown and nuclear weapons in a simple way:

1. Let's start with scale: The Hiroshima bomb carried 65kg of nuclear fuel. Hard to find how much fuel was in Chernobyl reactor 4 specifically, but it's tons, not kgs. A reactor of that type would go through about 25tons of fuel in a year. That amount may be readily stored close to the reactor. In conclusion: The amount of radioactive material is not like 1 atomic bomb, but more like **1000 bombs.**
2. A bomb serves a very different purpose to a continuous reactor: The purpose of a bomb is still to achieve the most amount of **energy released in one instant**, to create a blast and a shockwave. Radioactive fallout was never the priority, since it would take years to disable a country without the distruction of their capabilities. So the nuclear material in a bomb is highly enriched U-235 (80%) and its first decay is almost spent in an instant and confined to a smaller area. Fuel from a nuclear reactor is enriched to about 5% and designed to release radiation **slowly over time**. Time is a very important factor for the scale of nuclear fallout. With more time, still highly radioactive material can spread over larger distances. Simply. you don't care much about the most radioactive material, as long as it stays in a confined space. That's basically what a functioning reactor does.
3. And last: To compare it with the Tsar Bomb is still ridiculous. It wasn't tested above London, but 1000s of km away from any densely inhabited place. That radius around Chernobyl would have threatened the lives of **hundreds of millions** of people, easily.

And that's why those 3 heroes were needed, to stop the spread of all of the meltdown material into further areas. It would have amplified the catastrophe by an unimaginable factor.

Letting countries have a say and finding ways to encourage participation is the whole point since there is no way nations would join if there was no legal way to leave they way the US is setup. Also remember the wars in Europe have been about having a voice so working together which is at the heart.
