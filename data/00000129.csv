19,"You feel bad about them? Because a handful of people chose to fight back against poisoning of schools and beating up people in peaceful protests? There are 2 sides to this story. And one side suffered tremendously, the other side was somehow always acting lawful. Though I don't know the lawfulness of poisoning people, bashing down student protests, closing down cultural centers, beating patriotic people to shit in every other police highway checkpoint. Doing all this, to encourage mass emigration to vacate your mythological version of Kosovo. If that's lawful, then Serbian laws were on par with medieval laws and that's really beautiful of you to defend medieval laws.

I still am waiting for European countries cracking down houses in Muslim neighbourhoods after a terrorist attack, executing every male member. I can only imagine the backlash this would cause. Imagine them then calling it ""collateral damage"". Holy fuck all hell would break loose. The UCK never even attacked Christians or random innocent civilians with suicide bombers. Many of them were not even affiliated to any religion, much to the dismay of Saudi Arabia trying to exploit the situation. But there are thousands of testimonies from Albanians of Serbian crimes, crimes completely against Yugoslav law. Even criminals have rights in our civilized (and in Yugoslav) society. 

Serbian testimonies have been known to have no follow up, or of being very erratic. Same goes for many gypsy testimonies against Albanians, many came to admit they were bribed to speak up against supposed Albanian oppression.

Don't trust the media about China, why is it China or Russia have zero articles about supposed concentration camps in Europe? Who the hell makes this stuff up? There are witnesses, testimonies, pictures and satellite images. And muslims countries condoning the practice just goes to show the influence China has on these countries.

Here's to my uncle saying he liked life under Yugoslavia, he served in the army and speaks Serbian fluently. He says Milosevic actions in Kosovo are the reason his Serbian friends left Kosovo. They couldn't look each other in the eye anymore. He says Milosevic and his philosophy is as much an enemy to Serbia as it was to Kosovo. The Serbian people have to realise this at some point.

Most of these bombardments were a waste of ressources and didn't do anything meaningfull to decide the war effort. plus the British bombings started in 1942 in earnest, at a point were the germans were long concentrated on the eastern front above all.

The consensus is that since the baby needs the mother to survive and would die if she died, the baby is nothing more than a ""parasite"" of sorts. So it is entirely up to the mother to decide what happens to her body, even if that means destroying the baby. Sure, there's a limit on it, and that limit should be ""how long until you can know that you are pregnant"". 

And it's shown that it can happen rarely but not that rarely that a woman won't or can't know even after 12 weeks. And that the limit of 18 weeks (as it is now in Sweden) is a decent enough time to allow for (almost) any pregnancies to be found.

And another point, this limit is similar in most developed countries that allow abortions, and it's been like that for a long time now. But people don't know about it and when they hear about it they think ""huh it is a long time, why is that?"". Which is a fair question but deciding that it's a wrong limit based on limited knowledge is not a good idea.

&gt; For those that dont know what SD are, its a party of old neo-nazis

24% of the polled Swedes are not neo-nazis.

&gt; They do this as they work together with other right wing parties to dismantle more and more of the Swedish welfare state, lowering taxes especially for the rich elite.

The current S led government is removing the [special tax](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A4rnskatt) on income above $73 000 per year, SD wants to keep it.

&gt; In the municipality they rule

You're referring to Sölvesborg, which is led by four parties, SD being one of them.

&gt; In the municipality they rule, they focus mostly on banning things, like religious symbols, religious clothing, begging. 

I don't know about banning religious symbols or clothing, but that would be illegal laws. Begging is being banned in [several](https://www.dagenssamhalle.se/nyhet/30-tal-kommuner-kan-infora-tiggeriforbud-25592) municipalities though, for good reasons.

&gt; Shutting down art galleries that dont fit their ideology.

Nope, didn't happen. They decided they didn't want the publicly funded art to be [provocative modern art](https://www.svt.se/kultur/solvesborgs-styrande-rostar-om-kontroversiellt-forslag-pa-kulturomradet). No galleries have been shut down, no art is banned. Private citizens or companies are free to spend their money on whatever they want. Right now there's [art of Åkesson crying](https://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/gratande-akesson-stalls-ut-i-solvesborg/) being displayed there as a protest.

&gt; They removed free school meals, forcing the kids to pay a monthly fee.

I can't find anything about this, but it would be an illegal law. School is mandated by law to be [free for parents and students](https://www.skolverket.se/for-dig-som-ar.../elev-eller-foralder/skolans-organisation/avgifter-i-skolan), including [food](https://www.skolverket.se/skolutveckling/inspiration-och-stod-i-arbetet/stod-i-arbetet/mat-i-forskolan-och-skolan).

&gt; Banned the rainbow flag in political offices

Again, a blatant lie. No wonder you're so upset with them, if half the things you believe about them were true they would be an awful group of people. They decided to only raise flags on national flag days, and to only allow the Swedish flag, not other countries' or group's. It's just as much as ban on flying flags with swastikas or SD's party emblem.

413,"They went down there by 3 buses in total and then deployed to different locations. Around 15 of them were deployed in Tovarnik and their task was to hold checkpoints on every entrance to the town along with observation and peacekeeping (as much as it was possible). If you're intrested, you can check it out on google maps, shape of Tovarnik is pretty much square with a main road leading into town on each side of the square. On each one of these main roads there were checkpoints, which was basically just a cover made of sandbags.   
As I said, he was there for 3 months, from June to September, and they managed to retreat deeper towards Croatia just a few days before the Tovarnik massacre (there is no english wiki article for this) on 22nd of September Serbian and YPA troops tortured and murdered 68 Croatian people as well as the local vicar. All of the Croatian population was expelled and 75% of the buildings owned by Croatian people was burned or demolished, along with the Catholic church. One of the Serbian houses in Tovarnik was turned into a torture house and by the end of October a total of 300 people were either killed there or at the mass graves near the town. The tour that came there after my father left was entirely slaughtered.   
Anyway, back to my father. Some of notable experiences I remember him telling me is that they were often under mortar fire and while in cover, if you heard it whistling, it means it went past you. If you didn't, well, then you just prayed.   
For the entire 3 months he never slept inside. They had a place near the railway station where they slept in some ditch, either in sleeping bags or just on the ground.   
They obviously did shifts at the checkpoints, and every time they swapped checkpoints when they started a new shift. We were in Tovarnik a few years back, and every single house where the checkpoints were set looks exactly the same as it looked back then. The rest of the town is more or less rebuilt, but the 4 houses by the 4 checkpoints remained the same. The eastern checkpoint was by far the worst, for 2 reasons. 1. it was the checkpoint towards Serbian border, which was about a kilometer down the road. 2. right across the checkpoint there was a house of some Serbian dude who was regularly threatening that he'd blow them up. Rumours were that he had loads of bombs and ammo in there, but no one ever knew for sure. A couple of times he actually ran out of the house towards the checkpoint screaming he has bombs on him and he'd blow himself up together with the guys holding the checkpoint. Luckily, he never did.  
Only way of communication with his family back at home was a payphone some 100 metres outside the town, northern from the checkpoint. One time he was phoning my mom when they realized a large convoy of vehicles was going through the fields parallel to Serbian border and towards Vukovar. He climbed on the roof of a small building next to the payphone and stayed there for hours trying to not get noticed while the convoy passed by. As he was forced to hang up on my mom, she had no idea what's going on, but she later saw the news that tanks went through Tovarnik. He wasn't able to call back for a week, and during that time she was in constant fear that something had happened to him.  
This is the stuff I can remember from the top of my head.",,/r/europe/comments/dxz9rr/on_this_day_28_years_ago_the_fiercest_battle/f80s2ip/,iScreamEU,1574136747

The Guy Fawkes mask was popularized by Alan More in *V for Vendetta* as worn by V, an anarchist who opposes the government -- which is run by a conservative, neo-fascist party that gained control over the UK and adopts nationalist policy.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norsefire

&gt;Due to the chaotic state of the world outside of the United Kingdom, the party gained power by promising order and security among the population.[11] However, while the Norsefire regime did indeed bring order back to the country, this order came at a cost. Political opponents (namely left-wingers), Jewish Britons, Black Britons, Asian Britons, Arab Britons, homosexuals, Irish and Italian Britons Catholics and people of non-Christian, non-Protestant faith were rounded up and sent to concentration camps.[10] With their potential enemies all removed within a short space of time, Norsefire began consolidating their power over the country. 

-

&gt;In the film, the Norsefire symbol is the Cross of Saint George combined with a Nordic cross in red and black, with the black possibly taken from the flag of Saint David and the Nordic cross representing Scotland. The symbol is shown on flags, police badges, coat of arms, government vehicles, and army beret badges. Two versions exist, one with a red cross on a black background and another with a black cross on a red background.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dyfv8g/we_are_becoming_a_united_kingdom_in_name_only/f80x8uq/,duisThias,1574141197

&gt;For his refusal to rescind the decree, Bandera was arrested by Gestapo, which put him under house arrest on 5 of July 1941[4] and later, between 1942 and 1943,[5] sent him to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp.[6] In 1944, with Germany rapidly losing ground in the war in the face of the advancing Allied armies, Bandera was released, in the hope that he would be instrumental in deterring the advancing Soviet forces.

So he could not , just could not do anything in 1943. 

And Cleansing stopped in 1944, when Bandera got back...

629,"As an outside observer, I’d like to offer a neutral opinion. 

I think that you’re right. We do have to be careful framing these animosities as an “inevitability.” As you said, there was a time when all ethnic and religious groups got along, as far as they could. 

That being said, ignoring any animosities is also ineffective, and perhaps disingenuous. 

Relations between the ethnic Balkan groups were peaceful at times, but that was largely through authoritarian control. Say, during Austro-Hungarian rule or Ottoman occupation. Or even Serb dominance during the days of Yugoslavia. 

One of the most effective ways to quell animosities between different peoples is to bring them under the umbrella of a dominating political force. It’s how Hussein upheld stability in Iraq. And how the Russians upheld stability in the Soviet Empire. And how the Hapsburg crown upheld stability in the AH Empire. And how China currently upholds stability in China. All multi-ethnic and -religious superstates that didn’t, or don’t, tolerate dissidence in the slightest form. 

Those animosities and tensions might have been very real during those times of “peace,” but opportunities for physical contention would have been suicide, as a revolt between, say, Serbs and Bosnians in the Austro-Hungarian Empire would have been viewed as a revolt against the AH Empire itself, and squashed accordingly. 

Empire and occupation can also potentially bring protection, and thus economic stability. People tend to get along when they are not fearful of outside invasion and economic hardship. 

So people can say, “Oh hey, Serbs and Croats and Bosnians etc. got along when the Ottomans occupied the Balkans! See! Everything was fine!” But in reality, that peace might be attributed to the fact that a conflict between any such peoples would have been stamped out by the Ottoman boot of dominance.

Also, there are conceivable reasons for contention. The way Croats aided with the Germans in WWII and treated Serbs and Bosnians. The way that Serbs were left for dead by western powers during the Ottoman invasion, defending Europe alone. The way Croats and Slovenes, as Catholics, seem to receive preferential treatment from other European powers because of their historical favoritism from the Papacy, and integration into larger Europe. The way that Slavs converted to Islam to gain favor during the Ottoman occupation while others resisted. Even in a modern sense, Croats and Bulgarians and even Romanians might be viewed jealously because of their admittance into the EU. 

I’m not justifying these animosities. Just stating that they might be “realer” than we realize, and simply ignoring them is just as dangerous as fanning their flame. 

The real problem is that it’s such a delicate subject, and I don’t know too many people qualified to speak on it. People in the Balkans are often too connected to speak neutrally or logically. And people outside of the Balkans are often to disconnected to speak empathetically or knowledgeably. 

But I’m just a dumb outsider. I’d love to hear your opinion in more detail about how things are going there, and where they may be headed. 

When I traveled there often several years ago, I got the impression that younger generations have gotten better. And it’s probably true that the real answer to issues there is economic development. The idea of France, England, Germany, Spain, etc. cooperating would have been lunacy some time ago. But once you tie economies together and create prosperity, suddenly, everyone wants to have a beer together. And maybe save animosities for a soccer match.",,/r/europe/comments/dxz9rr/on_this_day_28_years_ago_the_fiercest_battle/f807hw1/,giro_di_dante,1574122270

HWRs are superior in that virtually unenriched nuclear fuel can be used in tandem with a deuterium/tritium neutron moderator. You can pull uranium right out of the ground and use it. You can buy thorium, often waste product from other light water reactors, and use it as fuel as well.

Light water reactors require highly-enriched fuel and it will cost us politically in the future - they are cheaper, but we will not be able argue definitively that there is no intent to build weapons. It will harm relations.

National question surfaced during negotiations over that. So Communist party of Croatia ( and public in general) splited into two major camps, confederal leaning HDZ, and centralist SKH/SDP. 


HDZ wanted confederal state mostly out of fear that what happened to Montenegrin leadership will be copied on Croatia, so they wanted to loosen up federation to protect that little power they had by the law. And like I mentioned, confederal idea was abandoned when Croatian TO weapons were handed over to federal army, and federal army proceeded it to Serbian rebels, thats when all illusions of joint state fell apart, and it was clear that there is no hope for joint state, not even for peacefull dissolution.

842,"I think I was fairly unbiased - that is why I said we in Serbia are taught (not in school mind you, we don't talk about that in school at all) something a certain way, to warn that it might be different and that there always are more than one side to the story. Which is something I don't think you are prepared to be open enough to do.

The Germans shipping weapons part was to inform that you don't stop a war as a great western power by shipping weapons to fuel a war. There are so many other non profitable means to end conflict.

You just can't compare USSR with Yugoslavia in a single way. Serbia was never a dictating power as Russia was within USSR. Serbia was and still is (by margin) larger than other constituting countries with larger population and once an industrial production. Serbia fought its way out of Ottoman slavery, Balkan wars and out of WW1 (unlike any other constituting countries), freeing the other Slavic countries when the Serbian king decided not to make a Great Serbia (which he could have done) instead opting to create a kingdom of Serbs, Slovens and Croats. These people welcomed our king as somebody who freed their country with flowers on the streets. The countries name changed to Yugoslavia to better represent the people with a shorter name that would include other Slavic people constituting the country. During the WW2 communistic tendencies were taking over, our king fled the country, the kings loyalist troops fought Nazis at home and the communist Croat (!) leader Tito. Tito and the communists took over the country and made Yugoslavia first into a communist, than a socialist country. This Croatian and Yugoslav leader kept the capital as Belgrade as it was and still is the largest city of all ex Yu countries. He moved some factories from Serbia into Croatia fearing an invasion from USSR so that if that happened, we as a country would still have some industries in the west (thus weakening the Serbian production). He thought republic of Serbia was too big, so he moved some borders around and made it smaller (to even out things) and among other border-pushing created 2 autonomous regions - Vojvodina and Kosovo. Kosovo had never before had autonomy nor was it a country of sort. It was simply a region of Serbia -so, there are no ""Kosovs"". This is enough of a reason for me to just stop replying to you but it seems my drive to reply is stronger.

Our former president Slobodan Milosevic should have been trialed at home and made to suffer more than he did in Hague. Now having said that I don't think you are aware how many accused Croats, Bosniaks and Albanians were let go from Hague that really did some awful crimes. You know that Barack Obama got a Nobel prize for peace right? So get real about some things please.

What happened in Kosovo was something completely different. Hashim Thaci the first prime minister of self proclaimed republic of Kosovo and ex president is accused of multiple crimes, like for example stealing peoples organs. Here you can have a link to the Guardian story about plenty of it: 

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/24/hashim-thaci-kosovo-organised-crime

There too people also suffered on both sides. Now you want to tell me that a historical part of Serbia that mostly consisted of Serbs throughout history separates from Serbia while Serbia is bombed by NATO forces (unlawfully order by Americans without consent of NATO countries) to have a situation that we are in today - the youngest country in Europe with second largest U.S. army base outside of US soil (camp Bondsteel) where criminality, drug and people trafficking are huge is a good outcome. Another US base to surround the ""evil"" Russians with as many rockets as possible.
In the course of the campaign, NATO launched 2,300 missiles at 990 targets and dropped 14,000 bombs, including depleted uranium bombs and cluster munitions (unexploded cluster bombs continued to pose a threat to people long after the campaign was over.) Over 2,000 civilians were killed, including 88 children, and thousands more were injured. Over 200,000 ethnic Serbs were forced to leave their homeland in Kosovo. Now they live in fear every day while Albanians are destroying centuries old churches and Serbian heritage sites. The only thing stopping them from destroying it all are the UN forces and that wont help in the long run.

There are some things you don't know because you haven't seen or heard about them. Have you been talking to me about something that I haven't experienced or witnessed I would have behaved a bit differently than you in this matter. 
And I never defended Serbs for what happened in the wars of 90's. Never. And I never will. I and all my friends and parents and family will always judge the decisions of our leaders and people willing to shed blood. Unfortunately I can't change the past, the same past that made me grow up fearing for my future, living in poverty, have the bombs shake my bed in the cellar of my house where we ""slept"" with pickaxes so that we could get out if we get buried under the rubble, praying to God my father won't get mobilized and die like other fathers did. I went through it and I can sympathize with other children (now adults) who went through even worse things. That's why I would never wish something like this on any single nation or person and that is why I apologized for my countrymen doing horrific deeds to other humans (whats worse is that those other humans were in a way our own people).
But I will also never forget the injustice we Serbs experienced and still are. It's just unimaginable to people that we also had injustice. Some would say rightfully deserved. Maybe so, but some dead children wouldn't agree.

Anyway read up on some stuff and I wish you the best Icelandic stranger. You are very welcome to Serbia, we love guests. Maybe you change your mind about the people (which would be nice).



So I really don't like people like you lecturing me when you obviously haven't got a slightest idea of what actually happened or what people were involved (Kosovs???).",,/r/europe/comments/dxz9rr/on_this_day_28_years_ago_the_fiercest_battle/f7zap8g/,kopiledon,1574107917

Koliko si puta ponovio tu mantru prije nego što si počeo vjerovati u nju? Ako misliš da država danas kontrolira medije, a i u neku ruku kontrolira. To je pičkin dim za ono što je prije bilo. I sve te diskusije u novinama i časopisima nisu razgovori koji su nastali prirodno ili iz želje da se o njima čavrlja. To su sve bili državno sponzorirani događaji u kojima si mogao komentirati o najužim materijama ikada. Vrati se sad u prošlost i probaj nešto loše o Titu reći.

I kad bi išli u inozemstvo, išli bi u države dopuštene od strane vlade, države koje su se nosile sa svojim komunističkim režimima.

888,"&gt;If you're going to call both the surveilling body and the EU propaganda makers, you need reasoning for it.

I gave you the reasoning - the EU statement's framing of the quick count vote. I said it before and even highlighted it with formatting. The EU statement is saying that 'publication of the voting results was unexpectedly interrupted' and that this is a 'shortcoming of the electoral process that undermines transparency and credibility'. Those are lies, I've explained before and I'll explain it again. 

The quick count serves to provide an **estimate** of the voting results that the media can report on. And an interruption in the publication of the **estimate** of the voting results is not the same as an interruption in the publication of the results themselves. So that's the first lie. 

The second lie is the claim that this interruption was unexpected - it was both announced before the elections that the quick count would be stopped after 80% and the quick count has been interrupted many times in past elections.

The third and final lie is the judgement of the interruption of the quick count as damaging to credibility, transparency etc. Quick count has no influence on the outcome of the election, and interrupting it before it reaches 100% is harmless, thus what the EU has said is an unsubstantiated smear.

Three lies. Get over it, the EU lies to further its own agenda just like any other supra/national institutions.",,/r/europe/comments/dy2nlb/eu_says_escalating_violence_in_hong_kong/f7zbugl/,SirSourPuss,1574108400

My point was that you cannot expect an audience to get in the skin of a tragic or otherwise important figure in a couple hour, so the film industry cheats to get us to an experience of the character’s life quicker that the 20-60 years of that character’s actual life. It’s lyric, and some are appalled by that aspect even more than the inaccuracies, for reasons that I could very much agree with. It is impossible to do otherwise, because of the acting. Would you watch movies that *really* depict deaths?

But dude. If you read r/askhistorian a bit in here, you know there is a bunch of tedious aspects too. There is no ""accuracy"" in any non-academic work.

915,"&gt;I stand corrected on court rulings about genocides. We can both agree though, proving a genocide and have a court declare a genocide is almost impossible.

Then don't call it genocide. If Serbia wanted to genocide Albanians, they could have.

&gt;What's your story of 'Albanian retaliation'? Genuinely curious how you suffered from Albanian guerrila warfare?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Radonji%C4%87_massacre

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kle%C4%8Dka_killings

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podujevo_bus_bombing

...

The treatment of Serbs in Kosovo during 1980s was the catalyst for that madman to come to power.

&gt;The problem here is, you are completely void of empathy towards our suffering.

And you think that suffering trumps law, but it doesn't.  

&gt;nother family member of mine had to grab his 3 kids, of which one had asthma, load up his tractor leave his farm and flee to Albania with absolutely nothing but asthma meds and some clothes. When the war ended and the family returned, their home was trashed, liquor bottles all around, and his cattle shot to death. This tells me enough about the motivation of the Serbian fighters. They didn't believe in Milosevic cause, they dehumanized Albanians just like you are doing now. 

The same thing happened in Croatia to Serbs, but unlike Albanians, they don't get to return. Why should Serbia accept independent Kosovo if Srpska and RSK couldn't be independent?

&gt;Historians are very clear in this case. Kosovo was and is majority Albanian. Serbian claims on Kosovo are purely mythological and political in nature. 

Again, that's not true:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Kosovo#17th%E2%80%9318th_centuries

Albanians became a majority around the turn of the 20th century, largely because of the expulsion from the Sanjak of Nis in 1878.

&gt;And now you expect us to ask for Serbia to rule over us? Why do you need your government to rule over such an insignificant population? Serious question, how do you think this will benefit you or your Serbian neighbor? 

Law must be respected, if you want to be independent you should do so by lawful procedures. I personally don't want Kosovo, but I also don't like criminals. 

I could ask you why do you want Serb municipalities, why not let them be self-governed?

&gt;PS: my friends saying I'm innocent at the police station is something different from countless people being displaced, prosecuted and murdered. International law is very fragile.

This perception is really the fruit of one of the more successful propaganda campaigns of Serbia.

Yes, the quisling fascist dictatorship murdered Serbs, Jews and Roma people. However, Croatian people, risking harm to themselves and their families, joined the fight for liberation together with Croatian Serbs, even though they were not in similar danger:

* 1941, 7000 fighters, including 800 Croats (11%)
* 1942, 25000 fighters, including 8000 Croats (32%)
* 1943, 32350 fighters, including 11000 Croats (34%)
* 1944, 121000 fighters, including 73330 Croats (60%)

In total, Croats made 16% of the population of Yugoslavia, and contributed 22% of all fighting troops. Croats were 40% over represented in anti-fascist fight. In Croatia itself, 55% of fighting casualties were Croats. 

Serbia was also ruled by a single-party fascist dictatorship which also performed genocide against Jews and Roma. Royalist and fascist Serbian collaborators massacred Muslims and Croats in Croatia and Bosnia. Many Serbs, living in Croatia or elsewhere, fought against fascism.

By no means I want to suggest that womens rights don't matter, but what I want to say is that, men don't have any rights. Sure there are different social standings everywhere and by now you should understand that in my society, men are considered nothing more than pests or war machines, slaves, toys, dicks etc. Yet again, it might not seem that way at first and not everyone like that and those who aren't like that would just burst into rage if saw me typing something like this. But I worked with risk groups, men are in total chaos, they get drunk out of their minds and they don't care or think and forget and give no second thought about it, women on the other hand who are in risk groups start to act like men just before downspiral, they keep everything inside, try to be more like men, what in the end has the same result as for men, but they go through this process slower and with more comfort.

Scotland currently isn't independent, but only the pro-independence side are wanting to hold an *actual exercise in democracy* when there is a mandate for one.

*2 You can’t flush the toilet after 10pm...This one is apparently at the discretion of landlords who are allowed free reign to set their own rules on many things. You probably won’t be chucked in a jail cell but you could get a stern telling off, and nobody likes that.

*3 You can’t recycle on Sundays...The Swiss love a good bit of recycling and they claim to be the best in the world at it – just not on Sundays. Just ask convicted felon Judith Schulte, a 35-year old German woman who committed the unforgivable crime of dropping off her recycling on the legally enforced day of rest. She was duly reported by one of her neighbours and offered a 250-franc fine or two-nights in jail.

*4 You can’t cut your grass on Sundays...Look, you’re just going to make loads of noise and ruffle up some feathers, best just leave it until Monday. This is part of a much wider campaign against making “excessive noise”. The rules on this are pretty vague and vary canton by canton. The state of Geneva has a handy guide that illuminates some of the other things that are considered too noisy like taking a bath at night, or doing any kind of DIY.

*5 Hanging out your laundry on Sunday...Just stay home, lock your doors (quietly), read a book and forget about leaving the house on Sunday. Closing your door could get you denounced.

*6 You can’t use a high-pressure power hose on your car...Using a power hose to clean your car is “basically forbidden” in Switzerland, due to fears of polluting local water supplies and the wider environment, Reto Baumann, an environmental specialist, said in 2013.

1088,"&gt; Gallic blood is boiling over Netflix's star-studded film of the battle of Agincourt, the King, amid claims it is riddled with historical inaccuracies, dangerously jingoistic and “anti-French”.

&gt; The French have long railed against William Shakespeare’s take on Henry V’s legendary 1415 victory in northern France, which left an indelible mark in England as one of its greatest military triumphs and a high point in the Hundred Years War.

&gt; But the Bard's poetic licence pales into comparison with David Michôd’s feature released in selected UK cinemas on October 11 and on Netflix earlier this month starring Timothée Chalamet, Lily Rose Depp, Robert Pattinson and Joel Edgerton.

&gt; That is according to Christophe Gilliot, head of newly renovated Agincourt museum.

&gt; ""I'm outraged. The image of the French is really sullied.  The film has Francophobe tendencies,” he said,  taking offence at Pattinson’s hammed-up take of the French Dauphin Louis de Guyenne, Henry’s nemesis.

&gt; “The British far-Right are going to lap this up, it will flatter nationalist egos over there,” he predicted.

&gt; English “raping and pillaging” was totally overlooked and the king’s cold-blooded execution of his French prisoners glossed over, despite them having “their throats slit and heads crushed with sledgehammers” or “faces slashed with daggers”.

&gt; On the other hand, the film invents a scene in which the French force English boys to murder one of their own before being massacred, said Mr Gilliot, slamming the depiction as “outrageous demonisation”.

&gt; The film was rife with historical untruths, he complained, including the suggestion that the battle took place in a mountainous area - Agincourt was all but flat with a slight rise - or that Henry had to be talked into waging war by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

&gt; Henry’s depiction as a sensitive leader dragged into a conflict he would have rather avoided was total rubbish, said the Agincourt expert.  Far from being a peace-loving pretty boy, he was a brutal,  bloodthirsty war criminal with a massive scar from an arrow wound on his cheek, he said.

&gt; “He had a sinister look and behaviour to match,” he told France 3.

&gt; Recent research dismisses as well wide of the mark Shakespeare’s claims that Henry’s “happy few” defeated a French army that outnumbered his men by five to one.  The figures were most likely 12,000 French to as many as 9,000 English, they say.

&gt; In an attempt to redress such historical “myths” of English prowess, French First Lady Brigitte Macron this summer inaugurated the newly renovated museum in the village that was the setting for the confrontation on St Crispin’s Day.

&gt; “We are disgusted because in two hours, this type of film demolishes all the mediation work we have been doing here (at the museum) over the past eight years and the research of historians”, including British ones, said Mr Gillot.

&gt; “It’s really worrying that one can re-write history to this extent and it is hard for us to fight against this. The public will always prefer a film to a history book. But here there are people under this earth, people who really died in this battle, that’s what disturbs me the most.”

&gt; When asked about his interpretation of events at its London launch, Mr Michôd said: ""Our version is very different to Shakespeare's and it is very much about a young man being consumed by the institutions of power. There are various version of Henry V basically about a heroic king invading a country. To us, this story needed to be more complicated than that one.""

&gt; The film has had mixed reviews.

&gt; While Variety praised it as an “engrossing royal-court historical drama”, the BBC’s Nicholas Barber called it an overly solemn “diary of a wimpy king” and the Telegraph’s Robbie Collin panned it as a “Shakespeare-mangling death march trudge” that “moves like a rhinoceros through porridge”.",,/r/europe/comments/dy59rr/netflixs_the_king_is_antifrench_nonsense_that/f7yf3sy/,quixotic_cynic,1574093785

Feminism is a good tool for that, while it undermines men's rights we can't move forward, either feminism addresses men and women rights, issues equally or we don't need feminism at all as another warmongering ideology that creates more problems than it solves. I don't know if feminism is a lost cause already, it might be, I hope not, but if feminsim soon won't start working for equality but stays at tits and dicks measuring contest for some corporate and political careerists I will change my mind accordingly and start advocating for patriarchy, and no one needs to be a genius or Sherlock to figure this simple thing out, it's already happening in society.

What Turkey issue? Turkey stopped wanting to join ages ago. There we do have a frozen process, by mutual intention. Seems precisely like a non-issue to me.

&gt; well for me, the current rules aren't good

Legitimate position, but doesn't justify not applying them. Macedonia and Albania didn't make the current rules. We don't stop people getting jobs while we review employment legislation.

&gt; another Romania-Bulgaria situation

Romania and Bulgaria are great examples of why we shouldn't stop accession processes. If they hadn't joined when they did, we would almost certainly have seen them slide backwards, and straight into Russia's sphere. Do you think these countries would really be better now if they hadn't joined? Would it be better to have another 2 Turkeys in our border?

You seem to have a vocabulary problem.

Protecting minorities does not mean letting them rule.

As a matter of fact, the AFD and its members do enjoy a lot of protections. Despite being a minority, they are still a legal party. Their members arent hunted down by CDU or SPD members in the streets for being a minority party, they arent beaten up by random mainstream party voters in the streets either.

They get to express their political opinions despite being a minority party.

Tito was a Croat. Take pride in what your own countryman built. A nation where all our peoples lived in harmony even if only for a time. Do I think secession was a crime? Frankly yes.

1177,"Russia’s top EU envoy has applauded Emmanuel Macron’s opposition to enlargement of the union, in a sign of how the Kremlin has seized on the French president’s “disruptive diplomacy” to highlight divisions among European allies. 

Vladimir Chizhov, the Kremlin’s veteran ambassador to the European bloc, said Mr Macron “has a point” when he argues the EU needs to deal with tensions between its members before starting talks for North Macedonia and Albania to join. 

Mr Macron’s trenchant comments on subjects ranging from EU expansion to the “brain death” of the Nato military alliance have triggered strong criticism from some allies for making Europe appear weak, while other commentators have praised him for confronting fundamental problems.

“President Macron has a point saying that the EU should deal with its own internal matters first before enlarging,” Mr Chizhov, who has been in post since 2005, said in an interview. “And of course objectively speaking, to say that both North Macedonia, and particularly Albania, are ready for membership would be a gross exaggeration — with all due respect to those two countries.”

Russia is one of several rival powers vying for sway in North Macedonia, Albania and four other western Balkan territories that are surrounded by EU countries and aspire to join the bloc. France alone last month opposed starting accession talks with Skopje and joined the Netherlands and Denmark in blocking Tirana’s bid. 

Critics say Paris’s position harms EU influence in the region and fails to reward big steps such as North Macedonia changing its name to end a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece. 

The EU has driven itself into a corner with its Russian policy . . . the number of political leaders who have come to understand that is growing

Vladimir Chizhov, Russia’s ambassador to the EU

Mr Chizhov said he would not comment on the “exact wording” of a separate claim by Mr Macron last week that 29-member Nato was suffering “brain death” because of disagreements and a lack of co-ordination between allies.

But he said the French president “as I understand . . . expressed some concerns that many people in Nato member states have”. 

“Nato . . . in the light of President Macron’s statement, has a lot to discuss in close format” at a summit in London next month, the ambassador said. He added: “We all know what [US] President [Donald] Trump had to say about Nato at different stages of his presidency.” 

Many Nato country diplomats worry about the impact of tensions over Turkey’s military incursion into northern Syria and between Mr Trump and European allies. The US president branded the alliance “obsolete” on the election campaign trail and has since lambasted European allies publicly for failing to spend more on their militaries. 

Mr Chizhov’s comments are likely to fuel anger from some European countries who argue Mr Macron’s interventions are counterproductive because they undermine the credibility of Nato and the EU, including with Russia.

Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland’s prime minister, has branded Mr Macron’s questioning of whether Nato members can still be counted on to defend each other as “dangerous”. He said the French leader was in a “different position” from some European counterparts because he did not “feel the hot breath of the Russian bear on his neck”.

‘Imperious’ Macron tests patience of EU partners

Mr Chizhov said he was “waiting patiently” for the moment when an EU country had the “courage to speak up” to veto the reimposition of the sanctions imposed on Moscow after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea — although the envoy rejected the use of the term “annexation”. 

The ambassador said he hoped an attempt to improve relations with Russia led by Mr Macron and Finland, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, was serious and substantial. 

Some countries, including the Baltic states and Poland, are sceptical about the move, arguing that Russia under President Vladimir Putin has not changed its behaviour. 

“The EU in my view has driven itself into a corner with its Russian policy,” Mr Chizhov said. “And the number of people and political leaders who have come to understand that is growing.”",,/r/europe/comments/dy3opb/russia_praises_macron_stance_on_eu_enlargement/f7y4srf/,2000p,1574086474

1182,"The US will not collapse. It is unlikely to withdraw.

Indeed, the EUs purpose is to remain relevant globally, far beyond just the military. However I and many others do not believe this attempt is fundamentally at odds with the transatlantic alliance. We can have the EU as an insurance, as a central pillar of our security and independence and yet we can recognise that despite all our differences much more unites us with the US than separates us, especially compared to many other powers and regions globally. Thus we can safely say that transatlantic cooperation on a level playing field is the second pillar we can rest on, and that brings numerous advantages.

We would be insane if we were to pretend the US were like Russia or China or India, completely alien to us in thinking and origin. It would be denying history and current reality.

Also, even if you do not agree with this and dearly wish the US to be cast away from Europe: It's not going to happen, the continent with the exception of some in France does not want it.

It’s very clear that you never travelled in France and Germany. These 2 are incomparable. I used to dislike SNCF, then I discovered how much of a pile of garbage DB was. There are tons of trains being removed, daily, for no reason. When I travel in Germany, I always plan in case of extremes, which I never have to do in France. The most you can have in France is a delay, which sucks but SNCF always reimburses at least part of the ticket and gives priority to the TGV (so they will delay a normal train if a TGV with lots of connections to that train is late).

1244,"He was a Croatian and Hungarian general, poet and politician. He was a successful military commander who has been fighting against the Ottomans from very young age, and he was the main advocate of a liberating war against the Turks. While he was loyal to the Habsburg kings of Croatia and Hungary without question, over time he became disappointed in the imperial court of Vienna. 

His military ventures (which he usually funded from his own pocket with other Croatian and Hungarian aristocrats) were often overruled. He was also politically sidelined. In 1655 he was the most popular aristocrat in the country, but the king refused to candidate him for the election of palatine.

The conflict between Zrínyi and the imperial court became the most sharp in 1663-1664. In the winter Zrínyi made a successful military excursion deep into Ottoman territory, and destroyed the bridge at Eszék which was to be used by the planned Ottoman invasion next year. With his success he brought Ottoman retribution on himself, and while the imperial-royal army was in the vicinity, the commander-in-chief, Montecuccoli refused to aid Zrínyi. His own retinue was wore down, the modern and very expensive fortification of Új-zrínyivár, which he built a few years before, was besieged and razed. In the end the Ottoman army and the imperial army fought a pitched battle at Szentgotthárd, and the Christian forces earned a resounding victory. By this time even the very cautious Montecuccoli wanted to go on the offensive, but he was overruled, and a peace-agreement was signed with the Ottomans based on the status quo ante. Zrínyi was the most vocal critic of this peace, but he could do nothing, his was out of money, manpower and he became a persona non grata in Vienna.

A few months thereafter he died in a hunting accident, but given the tensions between him and the imperial court, rumours about an assassination have started almost immediately.

Zrínyi Miklós had no surviving children, and later when his brother was executed for a conspiring against the throne, the family's male line died out. However, Zrínyi's niece, Zrínyi Ilona survived and married Rákóczi Ferenc, one of the wealthiest aristocrats of Hungary. Later her son became the princeps of Transylvania and lead a war against Habsburg absolutism.",Buda is vidék,/r/europe/comments/dy22n8/zrínyi_miklós_or_nikola_zrinski_died_355_years/f7xwtoz/,Timoleon_of__Corinth,1574078917

And if Putin really does use gas a trump card in his political games, it would only affirm European governments in their intent to become more energy independent. So ultimately, any such measure would be self-defeating.

As far as ethnicity goes, the commander of the Yugoslav Partisans, Josip Broz Tito, was a Croat. The Croatian Partisans were prominent in anti-fascist movement and they were overwhelmingly led by Croats Andrija Hebrang, Vladimir Nazor, Ivan Gošnjak, Franjo Gaži, Stjepan Prvčić, Filip Lakuš, Ante Mandić and Svetozar Rittig.
Not only that, the Croatian Partizans led by Croats were the first to organize and fight back against the Ustashi:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisak_People%27s_Liberation_Partisan_Detachment

&gt;On the other hand, Croats loved Ustaše https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ustashe#Usta%C5%A1e_Militia 

No, the Croats loved the Croatian Peasant Party: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Peasant_Party).

Such a bad point to make when Serbs loved the Chetniks and still do.

&gt;and they loved Serbs, you know, they even had daycare concentration camps 

That's a lie, those facilities were orphanages and children homes who saved children from concentration camps led by the Croatian Red Cross.

Thank God for those facilities, otherwise all those children would have died.

&gt;Nowadays you only chant on stadiums, in schools, you have Ustaše apologists in parliament and government, but no concentration camps, so you have that going for you. 

There's no argument like calling out hooligans.

Hearing ""Ustaše apologists in parliament and government"" makes no sense coming from a Serb. You wouldn't be able to name and count them using one hand, while the Serbian parliament has over 100 members from the party of Chetnik Aleksandar Vučić and over 20 from the party of convinced war criminal and Chetnik vojvoda Vojislav Šešelj.

&gt;Also, did you tear down every monument dedicated to liberation of Yugoslavia or is there some left standing? How do Croats see Tito today, you know, when the worst thing you could be is Yugocomunist or Serb in Croatia?

1508,"During the three-year period 2015-2017, the life expectancy of a male newborn in the European Union (EU) was 78.1 years. On average, men tend to live 5.4 years less than women in the EU.

Across EU regions, the Comunidad de Madrid and Inner London — West recorded the highest male life expectancy at 82.0 years during the period 2015-2017. This was followed by regions in Italy and the United Kingdom.

In contrast, the lowest male life expectancy at birth was recorded in central and western Lithuania (Vidurio ir vakarų Lietuvos regionas, 69.7 years), followed by other regions located in the Baltic Member States, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania.

The largest life expectancy gender gaps in Lithuania

At a regional level, the gender gap for life expectancy at birth favoured women in each of the NUTS level 2 regions in the EU. Women could expect to live over 10 years more than their male counterparts in two Lithuanian regions - Sostinės regionas (a gap of 10.1 years), and Vidurio ir vakarų Lietuvos regionas (10.3 years). These were the largest gender life expectancy gaps in the EU.

Gender gaps for life expectancy were also relatively high (over 7.5 years) in the remainder of the Baltic Member States (Estonia and Latvia). The gaps were also high in all but 3 of the 17 regions in Poland, the two easternmost regions of Romania (Nord-Est and Sud-Est) and the French island region of Guadeloupe.

In contrast, the gender life expectancy gap was as narrow as 1.1 years in the French outermost region of Mayotte (data refer to an average for 2015 and 2017). A narrow gap was also see nin the central Dutch region of Flevoland (2.8 years). Five additional regions of the Netherlands (Utrecht, Overijssel, Gelderland, Noord-Holland and Zuid-Holland), as well as three regions in the United Kingdom (Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, Cheshire, and Essex), had gender gaps within the range of 3.0-3.2 years.",,/r/europe/comments/dxz7ms/male_life_expectancy_in_eu_regions_the_life/f7xh1qv/,boemul,1574057274

1513,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vukovar

&gt;Vukovar was defended by around 1,800 lightly armed soldiers of the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) and civilian volunteers, against as many as 36,000 JNA soldiers and Serb paramilitaries equipped with heavy armour and artillery. During the battle, shells and rockets were fired into the town at a rate of up to 12,000 a day. At the time, it was the fiercest and most protracted battle seen in Europe since 1945, and Vukovar was the first major European town to be entirely destroyed since the Second World War. When Vukovar fell on 18 November 1991, several hundred soldiers and civilians were massacred by Serb forces and at least 20,000 inhabitants were expelled. Most of Vukovar was ethnically cleansed of its non-Serb population and became part of the self-declared Republic of Serbian Krajina. Several Serb military and political officials, including Milošević, were later indicted and in some cases jailed for war crimes committed during and after the battle.

&gt;The battle exhausted the JNA and proved a turning point in the Croatian war. A ceasefire was declared a few weeks later. Vukovar remained in Serb hands until 1998, when it was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia with the signing of the Erdut Agreement. It has since been rebuilt but has less than half of its pre-war population and many buildings are still scarred by the battle. Its two principal ethnic communities remain deeply divided and it has not regained its former prosperity.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/dxz9rr/on_this_day_28_years_ago_the_fiercest_battle/f7xhcwk/,badblueboy146,1574057623

1610,"&gt; Sure you can get some growth in your investment, but it's not enough to live on.

Right, lets do the math.

Lets take a German nurse. Average wage is 2405€, assume she manages to save half every month. Thats 14400€ a year. With the average stock market growth of 10% a year we can calculate how much she needs for one million. This average already accounts for market downturns. 

Quick excel spreadsheet says that if her income does not change and she saves half of her wage constantly, this nurse would become a millionaire in 22 year and then would be gaining 102 819,96€ a year, just from the stock market. Thats 8568,33€ a month.

1642,"&gt; Have you much experience in the US healthcare system? Ever been to a rural ER in a poor county? Because people who can’t pay come in every day and get all kinds of work ups. Eligibility for Medicaid is set at $42k a year for a family of three in Texas, for example - well above the 1 percent lowest paid Americans.

There's a monumental difference between ER and healthcare. One is patching you up so you don't immediately die, the other is treating you to live a long and fruitful life.

&gt;As for homelessness, Denmark is at .11 percent. The US is at .17 percent, which puts us at the same level as the Netherlands.

Yeah, the difference is that in Denmark being homeless means you have a place to sleep every night with food, social care, healthcare and everything else.

Practically nobody sleeps on the street, and 9/10 that do actually choose to do, usually due to mental issues or stress issues.

The US literally ships their homeless people to warm places since they can just sleep outdoors. They also don't have any guaranteed healthcare, other than ER.

It's just a totally different scenario and the US just dropped the ball on the poorest citizens - hence the unreal inequality, lack of education, healthcare, childcare and goodness knows what else for the poorest people.

&gt;As for poverty levels, I’d be hesitant to apply them across countries given that they’re based on median household incomes of that country. Taking the OECD numbers for household disposable incomes, the poverty threshold would be $25k a year for the US, and $17k a year for Denmark.

Mate ... the US poverty threshold is $24k for a family of 4.

The worlds richest nation ... $24k for a family of 4.

That's the poverty threshold for 1 person in Denmark - and like I've said 100 times before: there are a 1000 more things that the government provides in Denmark that the US doesn't.

And yeah, you can look at median income and try and argue that's the correct way of doing it - or you can acknowledge that there are millions upon millions of people in the worlds richest nation that have completely fallen through the cracks and that the system in place over there clearly isn't a successful one - unless you deem success as gilding the top tiers of society to degrees that have never been seen before.",,/r/europe/comments/dxjx4l/wealth_distribution_in_germany/f7xe0l6/,upvotesthenrages,1574054095

This is one of the reasons why Federalists want to push for a EU Parliament is to end the power monopoly of France and Germany inside of the EU. 

In it's current state the only government body of the EU that has meaningful power is the EU commission meaning that the ruling parties of the most powerful countries decide how the EU should be run(who are generally France and Germany what a surprise). 

If the European parliament would be directly voted for by the citizens of the EU it would be a counterbalance to the EU commission and the EU as a whole would be more democratic and this would also stip power away from the France, German bloc that has been controlling the decision of the EU for so many years.

1708,"&gt; I’m not sure why you think that. The poorest 1 percent in the US are on Medicaid. Does Denmark not have regressive taxes as well, such as VAT?

Yeah, but those taxes are majority spent on things that benefit everyone in society.

Free university where you actually get paid to study. Free roads. Massively subsidized child care so you can work after having kids. Practically zero % homelessness. One of the worlds best jobless social nets that means work places can fire, and people can quit, very easily. Healthcare for all etc etc etc

And I guarantee you that the poorest 1% of Americans don't receive medical attention the same way the bottom % do in Denmark. If you believe that then you *really* need to go and take a look out in the world.

If we take the Danish poverty rate and apply it to the US (both have very similar GDP/capita) then the US has a 40% poverty rate, versus Denmark's 5%

But of course the bar is simply set a hell of a lot lower over there so it doesn't look as bleak. And that bar is only for personal income &amp; wealth - it doesn't even consider the access poor Danes have to public services that poor Americans could only dream of.

I dont know more than one city in Thuringia but I think its okay that we all fall under the same jurisdiction even some states are bigger than others. Of course federalization wouldnt have to mean that every country has the exact same laws, Scotland and England have some different rules because of their different challenges and advantages, its the same in federalized countries like the US. Of course I still see your problem with it, it makes me uncomfortable in places too and I also think there has to be a better system in place that makes sure bigger countries cant dictate everything by themselves but that the smaller ones should also be able to have some power over the big ones when it comes to matters concerning them. Ultimately the question posed here though is what happens if Europe does not federalize. Whether it is even possible that any of us keep any relevance in the world, not just for the sake of being a global power but to retain the rights that other powers do not offer. When I see China buying seaports in Italy, the US pressuring the UK into accepting lower standards to keep trading or similar cases of outside powers gaining a foothold in Europe I wonder how long this can go well. Then, for the small countries it doesnt become a question of sovereignity vs federalization anymore but what big power controls them, same for the bigger countries. And I do think that if we improve the current system we can at least offer everyone an equal seat at the table to decide together. Of course ultimately, its the countries decision whether they want to get closer ties with China and subject themselves to their influence and in a democratic society noone should tell them what to do, I just wonder whether thats the decision of the people or of some few people who get rich of it...

1816,"&gt; Ok I think you’re taking the meaning on “not speaking” Russian too literally. It’s about being the satellite state...

I have addressed that in my reply to you. 

&gt; That was literally the reason.

USSR's best chance at global domination was in May 1945. Combined allied power was no match for them at the time. Instead they chose to stop in Berlin, which is what their objective was in the first place. They left Austria promptly under the promise of Austria's neutrality. Promise which they keep to this day if you follow their politics. The rest of the countries USSR kept as a buffer until it collapsed. Why it needed a buffer? Grab a history book or two that cover the last couple of hundred years.

Nuclear prolifiration is what stopped any ongoing conflicts. Once UK acquired nukes in the early 50s American backing became irrelevant. France soon followed. So tell me how again did US save Europe from being ran over by the Soviets?

&gt;You mean communists who collaborated with the Nazis. The real army was fighting for liberation all around Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The communists even revolted against the Hellenic Navy in the Middle East, which resulted in the death of patriotic Greeks such as Nikolaos Roussen. Roussen has been honored by the Hellenic Navy by naming 2 ships after him, including the lead ship and class of missile boats (the most modern today in the navy). That's how utterly clueless you are.

EAM was a partisan resisance group and not an official army,  that was communist dominated. Was everything they did good? Hell no, nobody says that btw, along with the rest of your answer you mention irrelevant facts just to promote your anti communist agenda to a guy that told you isn't even communist. The fact that there were Greek soldiers battling abroad doesn't mean anything the context of our conversation. 

&gt;Was PAO a bunch of ""nazi sympathisers""?

From your link:
*In the August of the same year it came into conflict with Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), a communist-led resistance organization. PAO was defeated in the ensuing civil war and its remnants** turned towards collaboration with the Germans**. *

Hmmm. Yup. Nazi sympathisers by interest. Prefering to ask the foreign enemy for help instead of choosing death. So much for nationalism. 

&gt;Both resulted in defeat for the communists. The ""Polytechnio"" brought about Ioannides. Meligalas brought about the defeat and exile of communists. Not sure what education you have received, but you're utterly indoctrinated and ignore basic facts.  Besides that, communism and ""freedom"" together are an oxymoron.

Again, literally noone said anything about communism as this is not the case of today's celebration. Although yourself don't seem too unbiased, do I even dare to guess the party that you voted for the last 7-8 years?

Well, that's the closest I could get to the school, because the whole area surrounding the school is pedestrian only. Which means that all the students here can walk to school and back. That's one of the perks of dense habitat. I spot 4 tennis courts just around the corner. Playgrounds and parks all around, could use some mainenance but do not seem dilapidated.

A small shoping  center and other amenities also withing walking distance

Save and Danube rivers are just next door, which what is maybe a nice park on an island.

The school itself has 29 reviews, total note of 4.6/5, perhaps the students were coerced into this ?


Something that is not visible on pics but that I can infer from previous experiences (although not in Serbia), is that there is a lot of opportunities do meet people (even people you'd rather not meet) and plenty of things to do. A lot of social uniformity too, which can be boring.

Here's a few great quotes: 

&gt;By the tons it is coming into this country — the deadly, dreadful poison that racks and tears not only the body, but the very heart and soul of every human being who once becomes a slave to it in any of its cruel and devastating forms. ... Marihuana is a short cut to the insane asylum. Smoke marihuana cigarettes for a month and what was once your brain will be nothing but a storehouse of horrid specters. Hasheesh makes a murderer who kills for the love of killing out of the mildest mannered man who ever laughed at the idea that any habit could ever get him.

&gt;An entire family was murdered by a youthful addict in Florida. When officers arrived at the home, they found the youth staggering about in a human slaughterhouse. With an axe he had killed his father, mother, two brothers, and a sister. He seemed to be in a daze ... He had no recollection of having committed the multiple crimes. The officers knew him ordinarily as a sane, rather quiet young man; now he was pitifully crazed. They sought the reason. The boy said that he had been in the habit of smoking something which youthful friends called ""muggles,"" a childish name for marijuana.

Fun fact: Anslinger published a number of crime reports called the gore files which detailed brutal murders enacted by reefer addicts. Of those 200 cases, 198 have been proven to not have a causal relationship with cannabis and the other 2 have no documentation whatsoever.

Another problem is that in every ""hot"" real estate market, the market price is much higher than the ""real worth"" the banks will calculate with. The difference you typically have to pay out of pocket as well.

2010,"I believe we're talking about the ""numbers agreement"" here, which supposedly lined out that Greece would for 90% fall into the British influence sphere, Yugoslavia would be largely left alone and the rest of the Balkans for 80ish% in the Soviet sphere of influence. I'd have to look up the actual numbers, they're on Wikipedia somewhere.

Now, whether or not there actually was an agreement is hard to say. If I recall correctly the agreement wasn't much more than Churchill handing a note (or as you put it, napkin) to Stalin, supposedly outlining the future of the Balkans. These spheres of influence could also just be a matter of circumstance, without any premeditated agreement.

Either way, for a few years after ww2 the British Empire was still a world superpower in its own right, capable of acting without consulting the US first. While this power would soon wane, in the late 1940's Stalin was probably in no way eager to be overly aggressive towards a fellow superpower.",,/r/europe/comments/dxje1c/this_day_in_1973_a_tank_stormed_the_gate_of_the/f7vcggw/,Eggplantosaur,1574022540

2019,"&gt;Jazz entertainers are neither fish nor fowl. They do not get the million-dollar protection Hollywood and Broadway can afford for their stars who have become addicted – and there are many more than will ever be revealed. Perhaps this is because jazz, once considered a decadent kind of music, has only token respectability. Jazz grew up next door to crime, so to speak. Clubs of dubious reputation were, for a long time, the only places where it could be heard. But the times bring changes, and as Billie Holiday was a victim of time and change, so too was Charlie Parker, a man whose music, like Billie's, is still widely imitated. Most musicians credit Parker among others as spearheading what is called modern jazz.

This was written by the head of the Bureau of Narcotics, Harry J Anslinger. As a matter of fact, Billie Holiday, who he mentions in this excerpt, had developed a heroin addiction after a rape, an attempted rape, her forced incarceration and being abused and exploited by her then boyfriend.

Anslinger handcuffed her to her deathbed and denied her medical help while she went through withdrawals and barred contact to friends and family.

* **Francia** - France, Germany, Benelux, Austria. High development, much political power, integrationist.

* **Mediterranea** - Iberia, Italy, Greece, Cyprus. Little growth, ties with Turkey, the Levant, North Africa.

* **Baltica** - Nordic and Baltic countries. High development, small population. Smart and enterprising.

* **Slavija** - former Communist bloc. Vulnerable to Russian influence, corruption, and authoritarianism.

* **Brexitland** - Ireland and Malta. Former UK colonies, high English-speaking population, growing economies.

It's not a perfect show, but it shows some of the significant rifts in Europe. Of course Poland would be closer to the Baltics and southern France to the Mediterranean, and Brexitland is a bit awkward without Scotland or Gibraltar in it, but I do think that if these superregions had different policies, you'd see a lot of internal friction disappear.

2073,"&gt;So in a ceteris paribus situation between Bosnia and Hungary a mere presence of Muslims results in a development of a global Islamic terrorist network? Yeah, I think I'm gonna go and keep attributing that to Islamism surrounding Izetbegovic.

You're right, the fact there was a genocide taking place against Muslims in Bosnia definitely plays no part. They should've gone to Hungary instead.

And no, there was no ""global terrorist network"" developed in Bosnia, and you still haven't presented any evidence that there is apart from deliberately misleading statements and Serbian propaganda factoids. 

&gt; On the other hand, you require no evidence whatsoever for your belief that he is a Catholic, the reason you brought him up in the first place. Just oozing bias.

He's a Croat called Nicolas and there's literally not any evidence at all to suggest he's a Muslim, perhaps that's why? I wonder, if your only valid claim of this is that a Balkan tabloid newspaper has reported it, why anyone should believe it at all? 

&gt;When foreign terrorists, for example, are traveling with official Bosnian passports because those of their country of origin are under increased scrutiny from the security agencies, then those passports count as ""a contribution from Bosnia"" 

Prove it please, and not using Serbian tabloids.

&gt;When most of the major terrorists known to the West have connections to Bosnia

""Most of them"" have connections to Bosnia? Which part of your ass did you pull that one out of?

&gt; cause Bosnia is still a security concern with its failed government.

Bosnia has one of the most effective strategies of dealing with returning foreign fighters in Europe. 

&gt; Macron's not gonna sit there hoping that the Bosnian government will investigate itself so that he could ""name a single Bosniak"", he's gonna block your EU accession path.

He doesn't have to, because you can not find a single Bosniak who is linked to 9/11 in any way, shape or form.

&gt;No, it isn't the correct term. There are Bosnian Muslims who aren't Bosniaks. For example, the MENA Muslims that became Bosnian citizens. There is also the Muslim ethnicity which is 12000 members strong in Bosnia and 100000 members strong in the Balkans. Your emotional tirades stemming from your misreadings are hilarious and present in almost every sentence you write. You doing the No Nut November thing or what?

nobody said brazil was liked in africa, 

still, they used africans as slaves, not a popular move in africa, that others were even worse does not make the us popular.

&gt;&gt;if russia did take western europe they would have collapsed even sooner, they would not have been able to hold such a large and hostile population for that long.
&gt;
&gt;They managed to contain half the continent and only US opposition in the 80s managed to crush USSR.
&gt;

the USSR was in stagnation longer then that, largely due to a hostile population that did not want their rule, internal opposition and bankrupty caused their collapse, having to rule a european population that is quitz hostile and larger then theirs would have been impossible without severe repression, wich would speed up internal opposition and stagnation.

&gt;

&gt;
&gt;You are drastically over estimating the results of a crisis Japan is in a stagnation for past 30 years yet they still are a very rich nation

with hordes of people just 1 month/paycheck away from bankrupty, we are not in a good position.
there is a reason our owners bailed out the banks when enough people failed to service their debts, our system is on the brink of collapse and without taxpayer funding would have collapsed allready.

that taxpayer funding comes in the form of even more state debt, leading to austerity getting worse, future generations are expected to pay the bailout when they can't even pay their own homes...

Similarly it was not an uprising inside eastern block that brought it down because in 1956 and 1968 soviets had enough force to crush them but they got exhausted by competing against USA so much that by 1980s they were unable to crush uprisings in Poland and DDR and in 1990s soviet republics declared independence and even with that hardliners wanted to use force in coup in august of 1991 and failed",Europe,/r/europe/comments/dx8bon/us_leadership_approval_in_europe_2018/f7ui9he/,Lox-droplet,1574015024

Persian/Turkish doesn't matter, many of them were from Semerkand or other Turkic land and were Turkic (even today close to half of Iran's population is of Turkish descent). Also were Muslims which mattered more at the time.
    
&gt;By this time Europe had a thriving artistic and literary scene, great inroads in astronomy, mathematics, biology, medicine not to mention it started the exploration age and the age of firearms.    
    
You weren't so bright in the 1400s in late middle ages and could only do what the church permitted you to do. Firearms and gun powder was invented in China in the 10th century. So what the Ottomans purchased the cannons? They used it better while you didn't know how to bathe and conquered half of Europe when you didn't know what to do. What they should've done is invest more into science instead of regressing by the 17th century (which is when Europe began eclipsing the Ottoman empire).",,/r/europe/comments/dxlgdb/oldest_universities_in_europe_by_country/f7uiioq/,janissarymusic,1574015103

Those are the official ones, the leadership is very proud of the Innere Führung and most German Soldiers are proud of Mission Command which runs deep in German military for ages in varying degrees. 

 &gt;A will to fight requires at least a purpose. And if the German army lacks anything, it's a purpose. 

The goal is to defend Germany. Now as you said we surrounded by ally's, but these needed to be defended too, yes Russia seems not be that dangerous, but things can change quick. Otherwise we need free shipping and have a great in interest to stabilize countries close to the EU. And the problem with military is, you can't just make a good one out of thin air, if needed.

&gt;As far as I can tell, the only three sections of the military that do indeed have a sense of purpose are the Medical Corps (who are top-notch and have always been), Special Forces, and the Wachbataillon, which is an elite drill unit of protocol soldiers.

The Medical Corps is top Notch in Missions, inside of Germany it's sometime lacking.
All three Unit's atleast need logistics, which units are also quite good. Naval forces, make even during peace time sense. Refugee crisis, pirates etc.

Also the Bundeswehr trains to fight an enemy. Which enemy is not choose by the Bundeswehr, but by the parliament. Soldiers don't really have an enemy in mind, during training.

&gt;That's basically all the German taxpayer gets for putting up €45bn a year.

2433,"&gt; Exactly, not really a concrete proof that he was an agent 

Yeah, because apparently his files got burned along with the files of actual agents, when the communist Security Service (SB) was liquidating those to shield those people from retribution. And then, shortly after said biography got published, Macierewicz, who iirc never really shied from filing lawsuits, publicly threatened to sue the author and then quietly backed down. That's as much of a confirmation as anyone could possibly expect that the biography is as true as they come and episodes like SB releasing Macierewicz from custody, allowing him free passage to a cordoned off area or limiting retribution for his political activity to confiscating a typewriter add up to something very ugly.

&gt; But he wasn't in the government. And during the last elections he didn't  even get to the parliament. Morawiecki, Kaczynski or Ziobro as a  communist agent would be a comparable situation. 

He was an active (and rather public) member of parliament for the ruling party in the last term. Whether or not he was given a position in the actual government, he was openly tolerated and shielded from critique regarding his past, a far cry from having his balls torn off. Not to mention, the very same party is now trying to put him in Constitutional Tribunal, where he'd have even more influence over the legislative process.

Also, this is not a military conquest, not annexation will happen. The goal of the operation was to suppress the formation of a kurdish state on syrian soil, to prevent instability in turkish kurdish majority regions. Wheter this is justifiable, or not, is something worthy of discussion, but this is NOT a conquest. Stop believing/spreading propaganda, people.

Also, this sub has seen an inxrease in hatred directed towards turks. And this makes just about as much sense as hatting americans for their country's imperialism. Most americans opposed military operations, but they still happened. And, of course, there were americans who supported the idea. But, that does not make them monsters, the world is a little bit more complex that ""category A is right and is good. Category B is wrong and evil"". People seem to understand this, when speaking about americans, or even french, british, spanist and portughese imperialism and colonianism. That what a country does is not always a direct result of what it's people want. 

There are a lot of people on this sub that say ""turks are subhuman"",""turks are destroyers of Constantinople"", ""turks are really good at genocide, lmao"" and activelly spreading fake news about turkey, about the turkish operation in Syria and about the valiant kurdish people, who are exempt  from any moral judgement.

Well - let's get one thing clear - either these things are all universally wrong (and then we have a lot of border adjustment to do, including a few NATO/EU microstatelets), or there's some weird tipping point that we need to reach before independence is appropriate.

Personally, I'm not claiming to have the absolute truth in my possession. I just really dislike American hypocrisy with regards to the issues of national self-determination. And ***if*** we assume that it (self-determination) is a right - then perhaps Kosovo should have it - provided they allow all the Serb population in, and rebuild looted/burned monasteries/churches/villages. Oh, and Republika Srpska and Kraina should be able to join Serbia too, for consistency's sake. And that's just the ""to do list"" for Former SFRJ - there's going to be some serious redrawing of Latvian and Estonian borders based on the same principles, and, perhaps Lithuanian ones too, if Poland cares to (though I could care less about that part).

If you're for all that - I can't touch you. You have a consistent viewpoint that I cannot seriously assault without resorting to rather ridiculous hair-splitting. Somehow I doubt it, though...",Belarus,/r/europe/comments/dx8bon/us_leadership_approval_in_europe_2018/f7qxp8k/,idio3,1573971327

2721,"[Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens_Polytechnic_uprising):

The Athens Polytechnic uprising occurred in November 1973 as a massive student demonstration of popular rejection of the Greek military junta of 1967–1974. The uprising began on 14 November 1973, escalated to an open anti-junta revolt, and ended in bloodshed in the early morning of 17 November after a series of events starting with a tank crashing through the gates of the Polytechnic.

[...]

In the early hours of November 17, 1973, the transitional government sent a tank crashing through the gates of the Athens Polytechnic.[16] Soon after that, Spyros Markezinis himself had the task to request Papadopoulos to reimpose martial law.[16] Prior to the crackdown, the city lights had been shut down, and the area was only lit by the campus lights, powered by the university generators. An AMX 30 Tank (still kept in a small armored unit museum in a military camp in Avlonas, not open to the public) crashed the rail gate of the Athens Polytechnic at around 03:00 am. In unclear footage clandestinely filmed by a Dutch journalist, the tank is shown bringing down the main steel entrance to the campus, to which people were clinging. Documentary evidence also survives, in recordings of the ""Athens Polytechnic"" radio transmissions from the occupied premises. In these a young man's voice is heard desperately asking the soldiers (whom he calls 'brothers in arms') surrounding the building complex to disobey the military orders and not to fight 'brothers protesting'. The voice carries on to an emotional outbreak, reciting the lyrics of the Greek National Anthem, until the tank enters the yard, at which time transmission ceases.

An official investigation undertaken after the fall of the Junta declared that no students of the Athens Polytechnic were killed during the incident. Total recorded casualties amount to 24 civilians killed outside Athens Polytechnic campus. These include 19-year-old Michael Mirogiannis, reportedly shot to death by officer Nikolaos Dertilis, high-school students Diomedes Komnenos and Alexandros Spartidis of Lycee Leonin, and a five-year-old boy caught in the crossfire in the suburb of Zografou. The records of the trials held following the collapse of the Junta document the circumstances of the deaths of many civilians during the uprising, and although the number of dead has not been contested by historical research, it remains a subject of political controversy. In addition, hundreds of civilians were left injured during the events.[17]

Ioannides' involvement in inciting unit commanders of the security forces to commit criminal acts during the Athens Polytechnic uprising was noted in the indictment presented to the court by the prosecutor during the Greek junta trials and in his subsequent conviction in the Polytechneion trial where he was found to have been morally responsible for the events.

The uprising triggered a series of events that put an abrupt end to the regime's attempted ""liberalisation"" process under Spiros Markezinis. Papadopoulos, during his liberalisation process and even during the dictatorship, attempted to re-engineer the Greek political landscape and failed repeatedly. In his biographical notes published as a booklet by supporters in 1980 it is mentioned that he attended Polytechneion, the prime Engineering School in the country, but did not graduate.

Brigadier Dimitrios Ioannides, a disgruntled Junta hardliner,[18][19] used the uprising as a pretext to re-establish public order, and staged a counter-coup that overthrew George Papadopoulos and Spiros Markezinis on November 25 the same year. Military law was reinstated, and the new Junta appointed General Phaedon Gizikis as President, and economist Adamantios Androutsopoulos as Prime Minister, although Ioannides remained the behind-the-scenes strongman.

Ioannides' abortive coup attempt on 15 July 1974 against Archbishop Makarios III, then President of Cyprus, was met by an invasion of Cyprus by Turkey. These events caused the military regime to implode and ushered in the era of metapolitefsi (Greek for ""polity/regime change""). Constantine Karamanlis was invited from self-exile in France, and was appointed Prime Minister of Greece by President Phaedon Gizikis. Parliamentary democracy was thus restored, and the Greek legislative elections of 1974 were the first free elections held in a decade.",,/r/europe/comments/dxje1c/this_day_in_1973_a_tank_stormed_the_gate_of_the/f7r39iq/,Hellotherefriend3333,1573974057

That same crook spoke on record about bribing judges, and the judges in question freely walk around?

The other governing parties are actively stealing EU funding.

We haven't had a government full of thieves, liars and idiots in like forever. Our prices are higher than in Austria or Germany, but wages are half or less. Roads are broken, hospitals tragically underfunded, doctors and nurses are fleeing the country, teachers don't earn enough to afford a rent in the capital and get shouted at by bully parents, while small entrepreneurs are squeezed by the state mafia of underpaid cronies wherever possible?

And people will elect a closeted neonazi gay who is fortunately so crooked that instead of actually implementing his stupid propaganda installs all his friends and close family members in positions where they can steal.

2731,"&gt;if the existence of your people is at stake then i see no issues with self determination. whether it is palestinians, kosovo albanians, crimean russians, uyghurs, or whoever. 

That's nice, but who's going to be a judge of that? Serbia was willing to negotiate about the status of Kosovo's autonomy in '99, but nobody took them seriously - and perhaps rightly so, considering how Milosevic's career started and all that. It's just that most people making this point tend to completely close their eyes to all the other situations - for example the cases of Latvia and Estonia, where local Slavic population is *denied citizenship* and is kept in a pretty oppressive check with regards to schooling (severely curtailed, pure Russian schools don't exist at all anymore), and political activity. I'm not an expert, but I doubt that the situation of Albanians in Kosovo was quite as dire in 1991 as was and still is the situation of Russian-speakers (that includes Belorussians, Ukrainians, and other ethnicities of the former USSR) in Baltic microstates. And that's not even taking into account the deliberate insults towards them with regards to historical monuments (which led to massive protests at the time). All of this was done in order to lower the overall proportion of Slavic population there - which they definitely succeeded in. You could call it a slow, creeping ethnic cleansing.

I'm not suggesting that we should wipe Latvia or Estonia off the face of the Earth. That's rather extreme. I just don't see how NATO can get so outraged at the treatment of Kosovo's Albanians on one hand, while accepting into their fold people that do the same on overdrive on the other. The case of Crimea and Donbass, where NATO/EU is supporting the side of the conflict that has units which quite openly use Nazi symbols and rituals is another case in point of total hypocrisy. If you read their message boards, they (again - openly) say that they don't really want the ""vatniki"" population of these regions, they just want the territory.

But that would require either me to have the patience of a saint (which I don't have) or you to have some basic knowledge about Orbán's regime before making claims (which you don't have) so that we could have a common ground that we can thread.

2969,"So you're telling me there is no regulation in modern Russia about any random douche being able to sell literal animal meat? So from what you've told me here, they didn't just breed rabbits, they sold them. In my country you literally need to licenses to pour people alcoholic beverages. One for selling alcohol, one for serving it. I have a hard time imagining that neither the USSR nor the Russian Federation has business laws like that. I mean, it's not like the CPSU had an interest in sending crazy rabbit dads to ""Siberia"" for no reason, especially during the, as you said, better years.

&gt; As for homeless, addicts, alcoholics, mentally unwell were/are living in the streets regardless of the economic system and ""right to housing"". Despite begging and vagrancy also being outlawed in the USSR. And that right to housing was also linked to the official employment and you had to wait for that housing.

For your first point, no. No mentally ill person or addict will live on the street if they have a place to stay.

&gt; By 1922 there were at least 7 million homeless children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I and the Russian Civil War.[1] This led to the creation of many orphanages. By the 1930s the USSR declared the abolition of homelessness and any citizen was obliged to have a propiska – a place of permanent residency. Nobody could be stripped of propiska without substitution or refuse it without a confirmed permission (called ""order"") to register in another place. If someone wanted to move to another city or expand their living area, he had to find a partner who wanted to mutually exchange the flats. The right for shelter was secured in the Soviet constitution. Not having permanent residency was legally considered a crime. There were also virtually no empty and unused apartments in the cities: any flat where nobody was registered was immediately lent by the state at a symbolic price to others who needed better living conditions. If a person who had permanent registration could not pay for shelter, nobody had right to evict them, only to demand money through a court.

&gt;After the breakup of the USSR and adopting capitalism, the problem of homelessness sharpened dramatically, partially because of the legal vacuum of the early 1990s with some laws contradicting each other and partially because of a high rate of frauds in the realty market. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_Russia

This seems to me that the social reasons for homelessness were largely abolished in the USSR. I'd say they did their best to house everybody, where in capitalism you clearly have the social construct of more empty apartments than homeless people that didn't exist in the USSR. See page 134 in this work about housing:

Wikipedia says there were over 140000 homeless in the USSR in early 1980s: https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8#%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%B4  
This is about 0.053% of the overall population.

Meanwhile Japan, while being only half as populous as the USSR was back then, has less than 5000 homeless people, or 0.0**0**4%: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_homeless_population

3045,"&gt; Wind doesn’t necessarily come with fossil-burning plants. All you need to do is build overcapacity (which is not a problem because as you said we need to decarbonise all sectors so electricity consumption will increase anyway), build solar (which is complementary), hydropower, build interconnectors to other EU countries (the higher the area, the less fluctuations in production), or build batteries.

No, you cannot just build hydropower without the necessary boundary conditions. And no, just building wind farms doesn't help either when there is no wind.

Again, there is a reason why electricity is twice as expensive in Germany as in France while France emits only 50 g/kWh as compared to 350-400 g/kWh in Germany.

Really, just let go of the idea to turn Germany into a country with 100% renewables. It's not going to happen. Even the folks I talked to at the Bundesnetzagentur said they don't even know how the nuclear power pullout in Germany is supposed to take place.

He is smart (in a way) and very very rich (due to his old connections and his willingness to play dirty).

His political movement started out in 2011 as ""Dissatisfied Citizens' Movement"", criticizing government corruption and incompetence. Sure, there was a lot of corruption and incompetence in those days, but still much less than there is now. He dropped an incredible amount of money on public relations and opposition research. He also straight out bought two of the three major newspapers (and some minor ones), which he now uses heavily (while maintaining the pretense of objectivity; the newspapers usually don't lie outright, but help push Babis's agenda and underreport Babis's shortcomings; also, the newspapers informed about today's protest in advance, as it should be, but one of them reported the time of the event incorrectly by two hours).

When talking to his voters, he paints himself as the only person protecting the homeland from European Union's overreaching bureaucrats. When talking to European leaders, he paints himself as the only person protecting Czech Republic from populists who blame the EU for everything.

3239,"You do not need that many batteries, that’s simply a lie. It’s practically impossible for both wind and solar to generate 0 electricity for an entire week, and biomass and hydropower are pretty stable. Just look at wind production in Europe. 189GW installed capacity, and there wasn’t a single time where power production was below 15GW (so 8% of generating capacity, and for a few hours only, not a week), and that with over 33% of wind generating capacity concentrated in a single country (Germany), and offshore wind market share being still very low compared to onshore wind (171GW onshore, 18GW offshore). So we can say that with time, thanks to a greater spatial distribution of generating capacity and greater market share for offshore wind, that minimum 8% could easily turn to 15% if not higher. This year less than 100GWh of batteries will be manufactured for the automotive sector alone. By 2030 battery production for the automotive sector will explode to more than 1.000GWh per year. So there’s your terawatt-hour scale.

But even if we assume no batteries, with a peak power load for the EU of 549GW, you would need 3.660GW of wind generating capacity to ensure that even the minimum wind production (15%) would be enough to cover the peak power load. In the case of nuclear, you would need 610GW of generating capacity to cover the peak power consumption, considering a 90% capacity factor. Onshore wind is 10 times cheaper than nuclear right now, offshore wind is 3 times cheaper. Let’s assume that 3.000GW is onshore, and 660GW is offshore. 3.000/10 = 300, 660/3 = 220, 300 + 220 =520, which would still be cheaper than nuclear, even with that massive amount of wind, 0 solar, 0 hydro, 0 batteries, 0 biomass. Add to that the fact that wind is still falling in price, and the economics are clear. You would also get massively more electricity from wind than from nuclear, in that example (4.796TWh produced per year from nuclear, 9.592TWh per year from wind).

Assuming a much more reasonable combination of wind, solar, hydro, biomass and interconnectors, the amount of batteries required wouldn’t be that big at all, in fact it would be a small percentage of the batteries required for the automotive market for example.

And as for hydrogen, I specifically mentioned it for the industrial sector, not for the transport sector. Hydrogen is the only way to decarbonise the steel sector, for example. And even in the transport sector, power-to-gas technologies could be the only way to decarbonise the aviation and possibly the shipping sectors. Its round trip efficiency is irrelevant when electricity is so cheap (onshore wind and solar cheaper than any other source of electricity generation in most of the world already).

With the electrification of different sectors (industry and transport), supply-side balancing would also be much more pronounced: you would produce hydrogen for the steel, chemical, aviation and shipping sectors when there’s high electricity production from renewables, and you would charge your cars, busses, trucks and home batteries when there’s abundant renewable electricity production too. You wouldn’t even have to do anything, smart chargers and wall boxes for EVs are already a thing, V2G technologies are already being implemented, and hydrogen electrolysis can clearly be regulated by electricity production.

BNEF predicts that by 2030 hydrogen electrolysis will be cheaper than obtaining hydrogen from gas, and both Thyssenkrupp and SSAB think that they will be able to completely decarbonise steel production using hydrogen by 2050. EVs will reach cost parity with fossil vehicles by 2023 at the latest according to BNEF. Add to that carbon taxes and regulations, and the way forward is clear.

As for nuclear, it may have a history of 70 years, but in developed economies its history in the last 20 years is nothing but pathetic failures.

&amp;#x200B;

They shouldn't. That's why there are talks here and there about doing something to be independent from the US. With how things are now and how Trump has been able to fuck a once stable alliance between the US and the EU (Russia is really happy with their puppet), no one in Europe wants to depend on the USA for their security, but we have to because Europe overall just isn't there yet economically. Here's the thing though, before Trump most EU countries saw the USA the same way France looks at Germany now, as an ally. Now Trump looks at EU more like an enemy and you are surprised we don't approve of him? lol

&amp;#x200B;

The part where you said that Europeans are ungrateful is really funny. It's obvious we are very grateful for the help they gave in WW2 and after it. But this isn't WW2 anymore.

3279,"The High Representative of Foreign Policy of the European Union, Federica Mogherini, has supported on Wednesday Jeanine Añez as interim president of Bolivia after the coup d'etat for the holding of credible new elections and in the meantime avoid the ""power vacuum"".

""The European Union supports an institutional solution that allows an interim government to prepare for new elections and avoid a power vacuum that could have consequences for the whole country,"" he said in a debate on the situation in Bolivia held in plenary of the European Parliament meeting in Strasbourg (France).

In the debate on Wednesday of the Eurocamara, a change was requested in the definition of the debate to include the reference that the discussion carried on the situation of the country ""after the coup d'etat"", but this modification was rejected by the full 234 votes against, 41 in favor and 88 abstentions.

Against the MEPs of the PP, Citizens and PNV have voted, while the majority of the PSOE has abstained. Together with United We have voted in favor of referring to the coup d'etat the MEPs of the PSOE Juan Fernando López Aguilar and Jonás Fernández.

Russia also supports Jeanine Áñez
Russia accepted on Thursday Senator Jeanine Áñez as provisional president of Bolivia, although she maintains her position that the actions that led to the resignation of Evo Morales ""amounted to a coup d'etat.""

""It is clear that precisely she will be considered as the president of Bolivia in the period until the new president is elected,"" said Russian Foreign Minister Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Riabkov, in Brasilia, quoted by the official Russian agency RIA Nóvosti.

At the same time, the diplomat expressed Moscow's reservations for the lack of quorum during the vote in Parliament to approve the investiture of Áñez as interim president.

US supports self-proclamation
The United States government said Wednesday that the self-proclamation complies with the Constitution of Bolivia and urged it to ""restore order"" in the country. ""We applaud the interim president of Bolivia, Jeanine Áñez, for assuming this crucial role at a time of great responsibility,"" a spokesman for the State Department for Latin America told Efe.

""We believe,"" he added, ""that his performance complies with the Constitution of Bolivia and that it is important to restore order and maintain legitimate civil leadership."" Washington supported from the first moment the overthrow of Evo Morales.

Latin America, divide after the coup
The recognitions to the interim president Áñez arrived from Colombia, Guatemala and Brazil. One of the countries that is decidedly with Morales is Mexico, which granted him political asylum, and that does not envisage supporting Áñez by relying on one of his axioms in foreign policy: the Estrada Doctrine, which does not grant ""acknowledgments"" of governments that can "" hurt sovereignty. ""

Uruguay also uses its usual foreign policy, after Foreign Minister Rodolfo Nin Novoa assured Efe that his country only recognizes ""presidents arising from elections.""

The Government of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela also denied the figure of the interim president and accused her of ""usurping"" the charge. Argentina also joined the voices of rejection, including that of President-elect Peronist Alberto Fernández, noting that there was a ""coup d'etat"" and explained that ""there was an army chief who requested the resignation of a president"" and ""a police that mutinied.""",Catalan Republic,/r/europe/comments/dxabfb/the_european_union_supports_jeanine_áñez_as/f7oi2ze/,Toc_a_Somaten,1573927804

3297,"What people need to understand here is that established politicians - those who currently occupy positions of power - have a vested interest in keeping the social peace in society, because a peaceful, stable society lends them, their party and their office political legitimacy. The CDU remains Germany's largest and most popular party precisely because it has managed to keep Germany stable and peaceful despite rapid demographical changes and growing economic uncertainty.

Sometimes, in order to keep the social peace, a small injustice is needed. This happened in Britain, where the risks to the social peace of targeting primarily Pakistani perpetrators of rape gangs were deemed too high to warrant rapid intervention. The lives of thousands of young girls were traded not for *political correctness*, but for *a lack of rioting and ethnic riots*, so that those in charge could move on to the next steps in their careers saying ""I did my part, I kept the peace"". As a result, most of those involved in suppressing news of the Rotherham rape gangs are now in more senior political and bureaucratic functions than they were at the time.

The same is happening in Germany now. The integration of refugees *must* work, because all politicians in Germany have staked their careers on it. No bad news should come out, no backlash should occur, et cetera. All must be done to keep the social peace and foster at least the illusion that integration is working, including telling lies, hiding information and blaming victims of crime.",,/r/europe/comments/dx79dh/what_does_a_14yearold_want_at_night_in_ulm_ulm/f7oijy2/,dgribbles,1573928029

What are you going to do? Force Crimeans to return to Ukraine? They won't.    
    
Ukranians want closer relations with Russia too. Not to be forgotten: Ukraine's democratically elected popular president Yanukovych wanted close relations with Russia, his government refused to join the EU, which conveniently sparked the “Regime Change Revolution of 2014”, a specialty of CIA. Yanukovych was overthrown by a minority including neonazi gangs and thugs armed and financed by the US/EU, found guilty of ""treason"" for putting his people's interests ahead of US/NATO interests (and the interests of the corrupt US democrats who are apparently involved in making billions by robbing Ukraine's natural gas, which Trump is trying to investigate, which is another reason the democrats started impeachment hearings).    
    
But the newly elected Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky also wants to turn to Russia. Ukrainians are Russians. The West want Ukraine as their proxy in their aggression against Russia and want to steal Ukraine's natural gas on steal prices instead of buying from Russia (which is also one of the reasons behind Syrian war and the tension with Turkey on eastern Mediterannean).

in the TWh range that can supply several hundreds of MW for several days, which currently don't exist even at a concept stage.

Also note that the best batteries currently available have a rather short lifespan, and are very far from carbon-neutral considering the mine to landfill lifecycle. For a view of the very limited state of the art regarding grid-scale batteries, check the numbers for the Hornsale Power Reserve.


--------------------

Vehicles powered by hydrogen cell fuels do exist on the market, and have been there for decades. However they sell in very limited numbers. One reason is that the logistics of hydrogen is very tricky, one other is that to mass-produce decarbonated hydrogen the main prerequisite is to dispose of humongus supplies of decarbonated electricity. The energy efficiency of the whole chain, from the electric generation to the wheel is highly unfavourable, to the order of 16 %. There are currently no credible industrial prospect concluding to the plausible adoption of fuel-cell on the mass-market in any forseable future.

------------------------

Low-carbon electricity generation with atomic energy has a history spanning 70 years.

Powering a national grid with renewables only does not exist anywhere. It is of course possible to imagine that it may exist at some unspecified point of the future, but this demands very optimistic hypotheses. One group of such hypotheses regards technologies that don't exist, such as grid-scale batteries or a reliable and economically viable hydrogen infrastructure. The other group is societal in nature, requiring to upend the usage of electricity and to shift from a demand-driven market to a supply-constrained market. Don't get fooled by phony promises.

The following article gives you a good, correct, idea what's about. 

Excerpt:
October 7th 2013
The Economist

What is stopping America from ratifying the treaty?

The treaty was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989 and became one of the most rapidly and widely adopted human-rights pacts.

It sets standards for education, health care, social services and penal laws, and establishes the right of children to have a say in decisions that affect them.""

"" Opponents of the treaty say it would usurp American sovereignty, a long-standing fear about the UN among some conservative Republicans.

There is a fear that the social and economic rights established by the treaty could provoke lawsuits demanding that the government pay for these things.

To address such concerns, America generally ratifies human-rights pacts with the condition that they will not overrule existing laws.

Parent-rights groups claim the treaty would undermine parents’ authority, particularly over religious and sex education. Michael Farris, head of one such group, ParentalRights.org, sees the treaty’s principle that governments’ decisions should be in the best interest of the child as a blanket permit for the authorities to override any parental decision that a government worker—such as a school official or social worker—disagrees with.

Jonathan Todres, a law professor at Georgia State University, disagrees:
he notes that the treaty promotes the family as the best environment for children and points out that 19 of the treaty’s provisions acknowledge the role of parents.

Most American laws are already consistent with the pact, but not all.

A notable exception is that in America under-18s can be jailed for life without parole (until 2005, they could be sentenced to death).

The treaty prohibits cruel and degrading punishment, so ratification might curb smacking.

Although America has laws against child abuse, a third of states allow corporal punishment in schools and none bans it at home.

America’s adoption of other human-rights treaties has helped to fill gaps in American law.

Participation in the UN treaty on child soldiers, for instance, prompted America to abolish the deployment of under-18s in military operations.

Ratifying the child-rights treaty could also improve America’s reputation as a champion of child wellbeing, according to Jo Becker of Human Rights Watch, a New York-based advocacy group:
“It is awkward when the US tries to promote child rights in other countries—they all remind us that they’ve joined the treaty and we have not.""",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/dx4qi7/the_austrian_president_has_invited_30_kids_from/f7o3t39/,Marie-Jacqueline,1573920310

It is unsafe. You should never forget that, no matter how old you are or what gender you are. You should use your own reasoning if you're an adult to take care of yourself. There is a reason most adults, no matter the gender avoid small, not lit streets, sketchy places... because they're able to deduce, it's probably safer to go around it.

3377,"The point I was making is that while possible, it's not efficient (P2G conversion is 50~60%) and neither is it 'clean' (batteries).    
And the majority of the carbon footprint of a typical LiPo battery comes from just how dirty and resource intensive is to mine the materials needed to make them. Lithium is actually a very small percentage of their composition, ~3% for most lithium-ion batteries, a much larger percentage being Cobalt, Nickel and/or Manganese (depending on battery type), all of which are extracted in massive strip mines and refining them results in a lot of toxic byproducts. The main sources of Nickel are Norilsk, Russia, DR Congo for Cobalt and China for Manganese, making a battery involves a lot more than just shipping from China, which also adds to their carbon footprint.        
Just look up any of the multitude of articles on environmental damage and human rights abuses involved in the mining of those 3 materials, nevermind Lithium.     
                
Nuclear as a baseline and renewables for the bulk of energy generation is the best chance we have at unfucking this planet, but fully renewable isn't feasible yet due to how reliant we are on LiPo batteries, for that we'd need a lot more progress in energy storage.         
   
On recycling, only 46% of the batteries in the EU end up getting recycled (2017 data from Eurostat), and even if we were at 100%, demand for batteries has been growing considerably in recent years so we still have to rely on said environmentally damaging mining.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/dwq54n/czech_republic_approves_construction_of_new/f7o4guo/,Candriu,1573920660

3443,"After the rape of a 14-year-old girl in Ulm, Lord Mayor Gunter Czisch calls on parents to fulfill their duty of supervision. This causes indignation - the CDU politician rows back later.


After the presumed rape of a 14-year-old girl, Ulm's Lord Mayor Gunter Czisch (CDU) has issued a statement that has provoked fierce criticism. On Thursday, the 56-year-old told the ""Südwest Presse"" how shocked he was. Ulm is a safe city, ""but there is no absolute security"". The local politician thanked the security authorities for their quick reaction. The constitutional state must now ""show a clear edge. No matter where someone comes from"".

But Czisch did not leave it at that in his first statement. Sentences followed, which after their publication caused massive criticism, among others in the social networks.

""However, I wonder what a 14-year-old girl wants at night in Ulm. Parents have a duty to ensure that a minor girl does not run around the city alone. I say this so clearly, because we must all take into the duty, if we want to prevent such cases"", Ulms mayor further communicated.

OB apologizes for ""misleading"" statements
After criticizing these statements, Czisch made a second statement late in the afternoon, apologizing and clearly rowing back, according to ""Südwest Presse"".

He deeply regretted that his original statement had been ""misleading. ""Of course, the girl is not to blame. The blame for this act lies exclusively and unequivocally with the suspects."" His compassion was for the victim and his family.

An employee of the Ulm city administration confirmed to WELT in the evening that Czisch was of course not interested in giving the girl or her parents even a partial guilt for the crime. Nevertheless, the basic statement ""The world is as it is"" remained - nobody could guarantee 100 percent security. ""We must take care of each other."" And women, children and adolescents are particularly in need of protection.

Investigators want to clarify course of events
In Ulm, the investigators are certainly continuing their efforts to clarify the possible course of events. These include questions about the drugs with which the girl could have been subdued, it was said on Thursday. ""This is the subject of further investigations"", said Chief Public Prosecutor Michael Bischofberger to the question of what substances were involved and whether the narcotics were initially taken voluntarily in a group or were forcibly administered to the victim. He did not give details.

Group rape. And criminal law doesn't come with it.
The suspects are between 14 and 26 years old according to the police. Arrest warrants have been issued for three of them, aged 15, 16 and 26, at the request of the public prosecutor's office. Two other suspects, aged 14 and 24, were released after provisional arrest. This was common in less serious cases, according to investigators.

So far, the authorities have not provided any information on the nationalities of the suspects. In order to better understand the requested arrest warrants, however, it had been made known that they were asylum seekers, the spokesman for the public prosecutor's office explained: investigators were assuming a higher risk of flight. The concrete nationalities had not played a role in this.

According to previous information, the 14-year-old had consumed alcohol on the day before All Saints Day (31.10.) when she met one of the later suspects in Ulm, whom she is said to have already known better. She went with him to an apartment in the Illertal (Alb-Donau district) near Ulm. The rape is said to have taken place there. The speaker of the public prosecutor's office referred to the fact that the authorities are obliged to be extremely cautious in their statements about the possible course of events in view of the victim protection for the young people.

Turkey claims these territoires for itself, via its assumption and claim that islands don't have a right for EZZ which is also true for island nations. North Cyprus isn't even close to areas where Turkey have disputes with RoC. Only issue with North Cyprus is, Turkey claiming some disputes with RoC and North Cyprus on the eastern coast, and somehow saying all wealths around the island belongs to both Cypriot communities, while also somehow being against a unification and supporting existence of North Cyprus and inexistance of RoC? Anyway, that was a comment to point out this nuance.

Aside from Turkish government's current greed, the issue of waters also about Turkey's possible inability to operate in Mediterranean after a Cypriot reunification, or even if somehow North Cyprus steps away from Turkey's influence and goes in deep relations with the south prior to a unification. Of course, it's not justified in any sense but that's pretty much the main reason. Recognition of islands' ability to have territorial waters would also weaken Turkey in the face of Greece where Greek Islands are too close to Turkish coasts.

&gt;Eastern Poland was not annexed by Poland in 1921. Poland regained independence after over century of occupation. Poland herself was “annexed” by Poland according to you probably.

That wasn't Eastern Poland in 1919 it was Soviet Russia how it was called then or to be more precise parts the Belorussian and Ukrainian Soviet republics.

Yes, but only partially. 

In this very picture we see the large walls and a tower in the background that were built in 1402 by Serbian ruler Stefan Lazarević, when he moved the capital to Belgrade. We see a side view of the huge Zindan Gate in the middle, built by the Ottomans in the early days of their reign. We see parts of the Leopold gate built by the Austrians in 1690, as well as some of the Austrian walls. Were it not for the Zindan Gate, we would see large exposed sections of Roman walls from the 3rd century (visible from other angles). Finally, we see the ""Ružica"" church, built in the 15th century, destroyed, built again in 1867, destroyed in 1915, built again in 1921-1925.

Noblemen would have lands and feuds across countries, such as the british in france, depending on marriages; they could owe allegiance to more than one feudal lord - and sometimes those lords were at war, so that messed it up.

They fought for personal and family fortune and glory, and that was first and foremost the issue. Any issue of ""this is our land"" would be secondary.

When a feudal lord rebelled against his lord, he was not a traitor to his nation, but to personal oaths.

Part of the change away from early medieval thinking was the centralization of governments and an assertion of authority by the kings; for them, breaking up the exclusive connection of the serf to the lord above meant diminishing the excessive powers of vassals.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/dwpq6s/today_135_years_ago_the_berlin_conference/f7nb6u9/,Tuga_Lissabon,1573893334

4059,"&gt; Yes, of course these crimes were committed because they are immigrants.

Sweden bombing attack article - nobody denies these gangs are largely of immigrant youths 

London article - London’s immigrant population was 37% in 2011, since then they’ve had large increases in the immigrant population because of the ongoing migrant crisis, making it one of the most multicultural cities in the world. Knife crime rose 80% from 2014-2019. 

Article on trafficking - literally spells out how the migrant crisis causes child sex trafficking. 


Rotherham - nobody denies these weren’t immigrant gangs, that was a central part of the story considering they weren’t reported on due to fears of being accused of racism. 

Cologne mass sex attacks article - again, nobody denies these were immigrant gangs, just click the Wikipedia link bud.

Every story I linked is directly linked to the migrant crisis and the ongoing cultural ramifications of this phenomenon.

Protectionism is preferred by populations that suffer from globalization and from international competition: factory workers, people with low education, and also people who live in the countryside in general.

&gt;Full blown conspiracy

Those are facts, not some silly conspiracy theories. Daphne Caruana Galizia is the journalist who revealed the Panama Papers, she died in a car bomb. As for Bolivia, there is solid evidence, in the form of recordings and other ties, that prove it was a coup supported by foreign capitalists, particularly the US. Fpr example, Tesla's stocks increased because ever since that coup they've gained access to Bolivian lithium. 

If you want, I can fetch sources if you're not bothered enough to search it up yourself.

&gt;full blown totalitarian communism

Is it impossible in your mind for communism to be democratic. Would you like me to challenge that? Revolutionary Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War comes to mind.

They dont have to buy government bonds with it.
Inflation is literally just the money supply increasing for a constant economic product. Banks routinely absorb cash from people when it is placed into their accounts, and routinely sum up money out of nowhere to give out as investments. If they do this well then it all matches up. They intentionally produce more than they get in to cause societal 2% inflation rate. 

In order to boost the economy, they simply gave out more than normall allowing people to invest and also putting more pressure on people *to* investdue to the high inflation. This spurred reinvestment and suddenly the money returns.

My problem is that conservatives like to claim labour funding has no origim when modern economics literally routinely just prints money whenever it needs to.
For example, have banks not produce the inflationary 2% and simply give the government 50 billion to invest on its own. The effect is equivalent.",Πρεττανική!,/r/europe/comments/dwoqpm/labour_to_renationalize_bt_give_free_internet_to/f7mhwr9/,TheSirusKing,1573863765

4223,"For the same reason EU doesn't budge and won't sign agreement with the UK that hurts Ireland - betraying one member automatically invalidates the whole group. That's especially valid considering the fact that EU is mostly a group of small countries, even though big countries have the most influence, small countries still have something to say, especially in a group. So while EU army being ordered to invade someone outside EU might raise a discussion, EU army acting against an EU member will immediately cause it to fall apart. My point being, if they attack Estonia, all the other small countries will resist (they would be next), so it would be France and Germany vs everybody else, which is the default scenario if there's no EU army. That's why EU army is no danger to EU members.

Moreover common army is a great investment. France and Germany want to push that to stimulate the industry. Since Estonia has a border with Russia it can negotiate that yes, Estonia takes part in the EU army (again, it won't work if small countries don't agree), but a few bases have to be built in Estonia and Estonia demands access to them (which is a very sane demand). Which works well for both parties - France can produce their helicopters, but in case they stab you in the back you can use their own helicopters against them for free.

In general, I think that while European army doesn't seem to be something we need now, creating one would centralize all the fundings on research and development which would, for example, let us fight against China if the time came without screaming 'mommy USA help' while they would be sending us the words of deepest compassion. Or the other way around. Or whatever the configuration.

This is area in Helsinki with most immigrants, while in general the Finns party got 12,3% of the votes in Helsinki (and 17,5% nationally) here they have almost 20% of the votes. [The sames results in another immigrant heavy neighborhoods](https://tulospalvelu.vaalit.fi/EKV-2019/fi/aluetulos_091047A.html).

The poor and workers generally tend to live in less nicer neighborhoods where immigrants live.

4252,"Dann antworte ich schnell auf Deutsch. Es wird generell schon angenommen, dass die meisten Deutschen davon wissen konnten. Das Problem ist dabei natürlich, dieses Wissen dann nachzuweisen. Gab viele Politiker in der BRD die dann nach dem Krieg gemeint haben nichts davon gewusst zu haben. Aber dann gibt es wiederum viele Berichte von Leuten die von ihren Verwandten auf Fronturlaub Dinge mitbekommen haben oder halt in der Nähe von einem Lager gewohnt haben. Dann noch die Geschichte der Euthanasieanstalten die auch kein großes Geheimnis waren. Da sind dann halt hunderte Behinderte in irgendwelche Anstalten wie z.B. Greifenau eingewiesen worden und dann kam nach 1-2 Wochen ein Brief in die Heimat, dass der Verwandte da an irgendetwas verstorben sei. Viele mussten dann nicht überlegen was da wohl passiert ist. Ich glaube der Faktor nicht wissen wollen spielt aber schon mit. Viele haben sich sicher auch gesagt, die sind im Osten und mehr will ich darüber auch nicht nachdenken aber generell denke ich war es schon den meisten Leuten bewusst, dass da etwas passiert. Die Ausmaße und Zustände in Vernichtungslagern waren aber sicherlich nicht so bekannt. Bis zum Ende des Krieges werden aber die meisten Leute gewusst haben wie es so abläuft mit Regimegegnern. Gerade von der Ostfront wo es ne Menge Massenerschießungen und Strafaktionen gab werden eine Menge Leute erfahren haben. Und Arbeitslager auf dem Reichsgebiet waren nun mal auch bekannt. Ich denke wenn man es realistisch betrachtet und mitbekommt wie viele Leute ohne Spur verschwinden und dann ein bisschen darüber nachdenkt werden den Leuten damals auch die ein oder andere Idee gekommen sein. Auch ohne die Recherchemöglichkeiten die wir heute mit dem Internet haben.

4329,"&gt; What signs are there that the EU is going to 1) integrate further in substantial way anytime soon 

The euro crisis in 2011 made it clear that the Euro required collective debt and large internal fiscal transfers in order to function properly. 

The move towards collective debt has already started with the implementation of target2 for the euro-zone. 

Collective debt will require unified euro zone budget, which in turn requires political union in order to work properly.

&gt;The individual nation decides and they can, of course, say no. What has ever shown this to be false?

That is false veto's were removed for most decisions by the Lisbon treaty in 2007 its all qualified majority voting now.

Even the ability to veto treaty change is questionable now, as in 2011 when David Cameron tried to veto changes to the EU treaty's regarding the fiscal stability pact, the EU just created a new treaty with only 27 members in order to bypass the UK.

Cameron said this new treaty within the EU that the UK wasn't a part of was one of the main reason he agreed to a referendum as it was clear that the same strategy could be used to cut the UK out of any future decision if it opposed further integration in the future.",,/r/europe/comments/dwtg51/where_do_britons_want_to_trade_with_postbrexit/f7m98qb/,SpiritualCamera9,1573857226

Especially before WW2 there was the term ""East-Elbia"" for the parts of Germany east of the Elbe river (including what is now Poland). Those areas were rather different from the rest of Germany, with large land owners instead of small independent farmers. The so called ""Junker"" class existed in this area and had a lot of power, but not west of the Elbe.

Konrad Adenauer, West Germany's first chancellor who had already been the mayor of Cologne under the Emperor and in the Weimar Republic , famously closed the curtains when he crossed the Elbe by train on his way to Berlin. He famously hated Prussia (which was ""occupying"" his Rhineland) and the East-Elbian Junkers. This can be seen as part of the reason why after WW2 he didn't make any real effort to reunify Germany, and instead preferred aligning with the western powers. He paid some lip service to the public by formally demanding a united Germany in the borders of 1937, but whenever he had a choice, he preferred a stronger west alignment.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/dwolvq/population_map_germany_poland_netherlands_belgium/f7lv8d5/,muehsam,1573848721

You answered your own question. If the UNemployment rate is low, the party in power, the media that favors them, and their base will hype that up and pretend it's all that matters. It's up to those not in power to point out how the UNemployment rate is deceiving. I think right parties in general are much better at playing that game, when left parties are in power, they are relentless either pointing out what I said (""that's not the real unemployment rate!!!"") or the opposite, making a higher unemployment rate seem worse than it actually is (when employment rates are actually still high).",,/r/europe/comments/dwm74z/employment_of_recent_graduates_in_eu_regions/f7lvra1/,proudbakunkinman,1573849001

4466,"Dude, you're really off. My arguments are as follows: 1) that tiered societies like in the past were shit and are incompatible with modern democracies; 2) that immigration isn't new, and people have been moving around forever; and 3) that the concept of citizenship we have today is a modern invention loosely based off of the classical era, but wasn't even around before the late-1800s early 1900s so romanticizing how hard it was to obtain in the past is a myth. 

As for Transylvania, you're totally wrong about ""only hungarians having citizenship"". That's some stupid shit Gigel at the local hole-in-the-wall rants about when he gets super drunk. First off, it really depends what period we're talking about in regards to what ""citizenship"" even meant. In the medieval period there was absolutely no such concept. At best you can argue it was tied to the 3 estates based loosely on language spoken, but also largely on religion. It was literally the dark ages, and you could literally get away with murder. It's not even comparable to our modern society. I don't care too much about it. By the time the Austro-Hungarian empire rolled around that's when the so called ""national awakenings"" were happening and people started to see themselves as different ethnic groups, but were still free to move around wherever they wanted under the concept of imperial subjects. Still, passports weren't a thing and you could go and work as you pleased in basically all of Europe. Much of Banat had tax free imperial cities where most of the residents were mixed and most of Romanias multiculturalism was. There wasn't any special privledges amongst people of different ethnic groups in the years immediately prior to WW2. Much of the big palaces at the time were being built by Germans and rich Jewish families, and not really Hungarians.

Modern nations don't allow for tiered societies. It's a thing of the past. Would you like to go live in the medieval Transylvania with tiered societies and nobility? That time period sucked. What the hell are you even arguing about? We don't have, and neither should we have, a tiered society amongst our citizens. Our country has laws. We can't discriminate against other citizens. They have rights. It's literally in our constitution.

They are being though proper sexual education. Not some bird got baby but how sexual intercourse leads to formation of kid and basic ways to prevent pregnancy.

&gt;Sure and that is why you can't get those on demand. However, ruling them out is a very bad idea for a lot of reasons. Usually people don't get an abortion because they feel like it, but rather because there are circumstances which make it necessary. Like if you can't afford a child, of if you are a drug addict or a minor and so on.

?? Currently socialist everywhere want abortion on demand regardless of how old kid is, kid could be 1 day before birth and this is what modern ""left"" wants. Almost all of the nations already have laws allowing for abortion in strict cases like rape. More controversial is kid deformation but still pretty much every nation allows for canceling such pregnancy.

4545,"Oh vey, so here instead of an article that has nothing to do with the subject I give you ""educated"" information:  


Equal pay between men and women has been enshrined in EU law since 1957. It was also part of UK law before Britain joined the EU but in a more minimal way. The British government had refused to incorporate into law the idea that pay should be based on value, meaning a woman doing a more valuable or senior job could legally be paid only the same as a more junior male colleague.  The UK government amended this only after enforcement action by the EU Commission. 

Introduced in the UK in 1998, the EU’s working time regulations (1993) mean employees cannot be forced to work more than an average of 48 hours a week. 

EU rules also secure British workers’ legal right to paid annual leave. According to the Trades Union Congress (TUC), the introduction of these laws gave six million Britons better rights to paid leave, including two million workers who had previously not been entitled to any paid leave at all. 

 UK laws banning discrimination on the grounds of age, religion or sexual orientation come directly from the EU’s Equal Treatment Directive.  

 EU rules adopted in 2008 say temporary workers must be treated equally to directly-employed staff, including being given access to the same “amenities or collective facilities”.  They also say EU member states should do more to improve agency workers’ access to training and childcare facilities. These regulations are not popular with employers and were resisted by the UK government during EU negotiations.  

 The EU’s Health and Safety Framework Directive forces employers to assess and act to reduce workplace risks. Other rules cover issues such as disabilities, noise and specific regulations for staff working with chemicals, asbestos or other potential hazards. The TUC says 41 of the 65 new health and safety regulations introduced in the UK between 1997 and 2009 came from EU laws.

That is exactly how modern countries work and the political parties will always tailor their entire campaign around the groups which get them the most votes, the future be damned.

&gt;You were mostly ruled by some King, whose right to rule was allegedly given to him directly by God himself, who also had the right to expel you whenever the hell he wanted. That's the kind of crazy shit that existed outside of the modern nations state. 

As i said before: you have no idea about history and you've just revealed your inadequate knowledge of human society.

EVERY country that has ever existed, including all the ones that didn't have steady borders and institutions, which had a King was not in fact an absolute totalitarian regime and all of them relied heavily on key figures the King had to placate to. Every time he failed to do so either he got deposed, beheaded or struck a deal whish severely limited his powers e.g. Magna Carta.

Every leader in history was the same in this regard with very few - modern!!! - exceptions: roman emperors, great khans, english and frankish kings, habsburg monarchs etc. they all had generals, family members and every kind of seemingly second-class authority whose support they absolutely depended on. Everything trickled downward and the countries which had the most power were the ones who promoted competent people and it all trickled from the top. 

Kings were not crazy and history wasn't some Game of Thrones-style shiet though even in that show you can clearly locate the lines of power if you pay attention.

&gt;ou think immigration and multiculturalism didn't happen 100 years ago? If you look at Western Romania you'll see it was a huge multicaultural place with Romanians, Germans, Serbs, Hungarians, and Jews all cohabitating in pretty equal proportions. It is true that nowadays we get immigrants from countries from which most people 100 years ago couldn't even locate to which continent they belonged to, and who are culturally very different from us. However, I'm not making an argument about immigration here.

You destroyed your own argument in the same paragraph and lest you forget we were talking about immigration, national values and citizenship because they are all related. 

Multicultural Transylvania is actually an example for my argument since citizenship was nonexistent for anyone but hungarians. Germans and everyone else were second class citizens and romanians were poor serfs with next to no rights for the longest period of time.

25 years to build a NPP would indeed be a quite unusual schedule.

For comparison, building the 2 EPRs at Taishan took just over nine years, *and they are the first of this design*.

&gt; For just 1 plant

Just one, but a big one. Stats for the existing one are as follow :

&gt;Nameplate capacity	2020 MW, Capacity factor	84.7%, Annual net output	14,990 GW·h

The new one will be *at least* as big.

Another comparison of ""big"" : to supply an equal energy and respond to the same load curve, you'd need a combination of 

* 404 wind turbines such as [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine#/media/File:Windmills_D1-D4_\(Thornton_Bank\).jpg)

***and***

* more than 5 gas plants such as [that one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barking_Power_Station)

&gt; China on Thursday threatened to impose ""counter-measures"" on Sweden if the Culture Minister Amanda Lind goes ahead on Friday evening and hands out the Tucholsky Prize to the dissident Chinese writer Gui Minhai, who is currently imprisoned in China.
 
&gt; ""We firmly oppose representatives of the Swedish government attending such an event, and if they decide to stick to what they are doing,  we will have no choice but to take counter-measures,"" Chinese Ambassador Gui Congyou warned in an interview with Swedish Radio. 
 
&gt; ""I believe some individuals in Sweden should not expect that when they hurt the interests and sentiments of China, things will just move on naturally."" 
 
&gt; Lind is scheduled to hand over the prize on behalf of the free speech organisation Swedish PEN at a ceremony in Stockholm at which Gui will be represented by an empty chair. 

&gt; Gui Minhai left China in 1988 to study for a doctorate at Gothenburg University, later becoming a Swedish citizen. He disappeared while on holiday in Thailand in 2015. A video, in which he confessed to committing ""illegal business operations"" was released by Chinese authorities three months later. 
 
&gt; Swedish Pen's chairman Jesper Bengtsson said the ambassador's threatening language would only worsen the dispute. 
 
&gt; ""It just ratchets this up even more. I can only say that they seem very keen to get involved in what people think and believe in Sweden,"" he said.  

&gt; PEN International on Thursday issued a statement in support of its Swedish wing, saying it was ""appalled"" that it had faced threats from the Chinese embassy. 
 
&gt; ""This is not the first time that the Chinese regime has tried to intimidate those highlighting the egregious case of injustice against Gui Minhai,"" said PEN President Jennifer Clement
 
&gt; ""No matter what coercive measures the Chinese authorities employ, they cannot erase the facts of this case: Gui Minhai was kidnapped, disappeared for several months, forced into a televised confession and remains in prison today, simply for publishing books critical of the Chinese authorities."" 
 
&gt; Before his arrest, Gui was a prolific writer and publisher of books critical of the Chinese government, operating through the Hong-Kong based publisher Causeway Bay Books. 
 
&gt; Sweden's foreign minister Ann Linde has earlier pushed back at China over its criticism of Swedish PEN's decision to award Gui the prize. 
 
&gt; ""The Foreign Ministry has explained to the ambassador that there is a freedom of expression in Sweden,"" she said.  ""Sweden's principle of freedom of expression guarantees Swedish PEN the right to freely and without influence award the prize to whomsoever they wish."" 
 
&gt; The Tucholsky award is given by Swedish PEN to a writer or publisher who faces persecution or has been forced into exile.

4714,"&gt; Today is not the 70s. You know none of that applies today.

It doesn't apply today because we've had privatisation. Do you know why BT wouldn't provide sockets so people could connect their own phones? Because the unions didn't like the idea of their members losing their jobs. Nationalised industries end up being run for the convenience of the workers, not the public. 

&gt;Though of there were waiting times is that not an advantage for private companies?

That would depend on whether or not they allowed private companies access to the public network. They didn't last time they set one up, the unions would oppose it, and it would look very bad for the government if the private sector could connect you faster to the government owned network than the government's own company could. 

&gt;Likewise can they not offer improved services or bundles?

Full fibre allows speeds and data limits far higher than 99.9% of the population need. If that's free, there'd be very little market left for private providers.

&gt;They aren't even buying BT, just the network.

And BT's consumer division which is the retail ISP. So everybody would get a free network connection and a free ISP account. It wouldn't affect the market for TV services, it would kill independent ISPs.

&gt;Though frankly, if your argument is ""won't someone think of the corporations!"" you need to think about that.

It's not the corporations I'm worried about. It's everyone getting a free, crap service that drives out all other investment and alternatives. At the moment you have government setting the rules, a regulator overseeing their operation and companies competing for customers. That would be replaced with the government setting the rules, overseeing their operation and providing the service. A top to bottom government monopoly.

4725,"Find me in which country socialized healthcare works great.

I live in Poland and we have socialized healthcare. Just 2 weeks ago my uncle who was diagnosed with terminal cancer was basically showed away from hospital because they didn't have beds for dying person. And instead of giving him painkillers and oxygen (lung cancer) he slowly had to asphyxiate in home in pain because tumors in his lungs spread out and started to push his bloodstream and nervous system paralizing his right leg and hand and causing him immense pain.

He worked nearly 40 years. Almost never gone to doctor and in the end for 40 years of his contribution to socialized medicine (part of taxes he paid) he wasn't even given a week of bed and bunch of cheap pills that could give him at least peaceful death.

And that is not even counting my family who had to do everything themselves like washing him, changing his clothes and so on.

During the campaigning Leave was constantly ""Immigration! Immigration! Immigration!"" While Remain was constantly ""Economy! GDP! Economy!"" I followed them both pretty closely and I don't recall at any point the remain campaign pointing out that we could have reduced EU immigration by 60% with the snap of our fingers. It's why I wish the EU had gotten involved in the campaigning, they could have pointed out these things to the people. 

Instead, the remain side focuses on the issue that people didnt really care about, they've spent decades hearing how the economy is going up and up, all while their wages have stagnated and their quality of life has gotten worse. Of course they didn't give a shit when Remains argument was based around it.

Elections are a very low resolution way of deriving what the public wants on specific issues. You have a meagre selection of viable parties to pick from and unrelated issues get bundled together such that you cannot democratically express a precise desire on immigration without it being coupled with other arbitrary issues like taxation, military spending or in the UK even stupid things like fox hunting.

A healthy democracy would balance the role of elected representatives with more direct means of the public asserting their preferences e.g. referenda. We see this work in Switzerland, it's not perfect but the government is more directly accountable on precise matters that the public chooses.

And specifically on immigration, we have a major issue because all of the parties in my country and others particularly in Western Europe basically have the same policy - lots of it. And that's in huge part because of the economic implications for their campaign donors who want cheap labour.

Demonized unfairly? And even if, that all of a sudden is an excuse to go full bonkers? Sorry mate, I have a lot of understanding for a lot of issues, incuding people being overburdened with immigration. . 

But 1. The people voting for fashists are in the areas ""least"" affected by immigration, as such the shizophrenia of that argument comes to pass. 

And 2. It STILL is not excuse to vote fashist. 

&gt; Again, they have been demonized since day one.  Nobody on the left  waited for any point and there has been no reasonable debate because  nobody on the left is open minded enough to to actually lisen to any  opinion other their own.  Duh 

They have been demonized because they accepted the radical elements within their ranks with open arms. If Pegida and all the stuff was a movement based on people with ""legimiate"" concern, and yes, that includes simple people who are too challenged to deal with foreign people, I am all for it. 

But when you go together with people that openly support national socialistic premises, then all understanding goes out of the window. And demonzing is more then ustified in such a case. 

I repeat, there is no, not one, reason that justifies to vote some of the vilest ideologies out there.

&amp;#x200B;

Poland has been givinen up on constant gas supplies from Russia since 2023. Polskie Górnictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo sent an official letter to Russian Gazprom saying that after the expiry of the contact for permanent gas supplies at the end of 2022, we will not sign another one.

Poland will now take gas further from Russia, but not on the basis of the Yamal contact, which imposes a specific amount of gas for us to take, condemns us to the good will of the Russians and causes large price fluctuations. **From 2023, we are to decide, based on our needs, how much gas from Russia we want and whether at all**.

Russia is to become not our main, but a spare gas supplier. Pursuant to the provisions of the contract, the parties to the contract are required to submit a declaration regarding further cooperation after 2022 three years before the planned end of its validity on December 31, 2022 - explained in a statement sent to Russian Gazprom.

Instead, we will want to import raw materials, for example, by ships from America and other points of the world to our gas terminal in Świnoujście.

The construction of a new Baltic Pipe gas pipeline, which is to connect us with Denmark and Norway, is also underway. This is to be our main source of supply. However, it is still uncertain whether the Russians will block the construction, which - although carried out according to the schedule - is still not ready. However, at the end of September this year. During the National Economic Summit in Siedlce, PGNiG's Vice President for Trade, Maciej Woźniak, announced that in 2023 the company will be able to meet domestic gas demand of over 24 billion cubic meters.

The Yamal contract expires in 2022

The Yamal contract signed in 1996 provides for the delivery of approximately 10 billion cubic meters. gas per year. Pursuant to the take-or-pay clause imposed by Gazprom, PGNiG must collect at least 8.7 billion cubic meters. contracted gas per year.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/dwov7t/poland_officially_resigns_from_furthering_gas/f7kj7vr/,Tartyron,1573813307

5224,"Every European should read this article from Ben Judah :

**London's Laundry Business**

LONDON — THE city has changed. The buses are still dirty, the people are still passive-aggressive, but something about London has changed. You can see signs of it everywhere. The townhouses in the capital’s poshest districts are empty; they have been sold to Russian oligarchs and Qatari princes.

England’s establishment is not what it was; the old imperial elite has become crude and mercenary. On Monday, a British civil servant was photographed arriving in Downing Street for a national security council meeting with an open document in his hand. We could read for ourselves lines from a confidential report on how Prime Minister David Cameron’s government should respond to the Crimea crisis. It recommended that Britain should “not support, for now, trade sanctions,” nor should it “close London’s financial center to Russians.”

The White House has imposed visa restrictions on some Russian officials, and President Obama has issued an executive order enabling further sanctions. But Britain has already undermined any unified action by putting profit first.

It boils down to this: Britain is ready to betray the United States to protect the City of London’s hold on dirty Russian money. And forget about Ukraine.

Britain, open for business, no longer has a “mission.” Any moralizing remnant of the British Empire is gone; it has turned back to the pirate England of Sir Walter Raleigh. Britain’s ruling class has decayed to the point where its first priority is protecting its cut of Russian money — even as Russian armored personnel carriers rumble around the streets of Sevastopol. But the establishment understands that, in the 21st century, what matters are banks, not tanks.

The Russians also understand this. They know that London is a center of Russian corruption, that their loot plunges into Britain’s empire of tax havens — from Gibraltar to Jersey, from the Cayman Islands to the British Virgin Islands — on which the sun never sets.

British residency is up for sale. “Investor visas” can be purchased, starting at £1 million ($1.6 million). London lawyers in the Commercial Court now get 60 percent of their work from Russian and Eastern European clients. More than 50 Russia-based companies swell the trade at London’s Stock Exchange. The planning regulations have been scrapped, and along the Thames, up go spires of steel and glass for the hedge-funding class.

Britain’s bright young things now become consultants, art dealers, private banker and hedge funders. Or, to put it another way, the oligarchs’ valets.

Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, gets it: you pay them, you own them. Mr. Putin was absolutely certain that Britain’s managers — shuttling through the revolving door between cabinet posts and financial boards — would never give up their fees and commissions from the oligarchs’ billions. He was right.

In the austerity years of zero growth that followed the 2008 financial crash, this new source of vast wealth could not be resisted. Tony Blair is the latter-day embodiment of pirate Britain’s Sir Walter Raleigh. The former prime minister now advises the Kazakh ruler Nursultan Nazarbayev on his image in the West. Mr. Blair is handsomely paid to tutor his patron on how to be evasive about the crackdowns and the mine shootings that are facts of life in Kazakhstan.

This is Britain’s growth business today: laundering oligarchs’ dirty billions, laundering their dirty reputations.

It could be otherwise. Banking sanctions could turn off the financial pipelines through which corrupt officials channel Russian money. Visa restrictions could cut Kremlin ministers off from their mansions. The tax havens that rob the national budget of billions could be forced to be accountable. Britain has the power to bankrupt the Putin clique.

But London has changed. And the Shard — the Qatari-owned, 72-floor skyscraper above the grotty Southwark riverside — is a symbol of that change.

The Shard encapsulates the new hierarchy of the city. On the top floors, “ultra high net worth individuals” entertain escorts in luxury apartments. By day, on floors below, investment bankers trade incomprehensible derivatives.

Come nightfall, the elevators are full of African cleaners, paid next to nothing and treated as nonexistent. The acres of glass windows are scrubbed by Polish laborers, who sleep four to a room in bedsit slums. And near the Shard are the immigrants from Lithuania and Romania, who broke their backs on construction sites, but are now destitute and whiling away their hours along the banks of the Thames.

The Shard is London, a symbol of a city where oligarchs are celebrated and migrants are exploited but that pretends to be a multicultural utopia. Here, in their capital city, the English are no longer calling the shots. They are hirelings.

As far as I followed many relatively educated Turks including the well recognized historians no one is denying the mass murder of Armenians, they’re trying to prove it was never an intent to terminate whole race. Then they don’t accept partly destroying it would still be called genocide since they find no executive orders from the empire itself. 

This Armenian Genocide story is actually a very horrible chain of events that whatever you make on the subject you could not satisfy anyone. I personally get mad for seeing deniers and people sink in whataboutism but my views on the subject (as a person with bachelor on history) that it became a political hammer recently and it made it more complex to solve. I hate state sponsored information, the history Turkey was providing was full of it, on the other hand, allied archives was targeting the same propaganda if they search for what they published or recorded at that time. 

In my ideal solution Turkey to admit there was a genocide, but never take full responsibility for it, but still return the private properties to the Armenian families that lived in Anatolia, compensate the new owners of those lands since they were sold to them illegally, then Armenia to admit those rebellious Russian backed militia also targeted ethnic cleansing of Turks living in Eastern Turkey, and apologize for ASALA attacks which were state sponsored terrorist attacks on modern time Turkey, compensate their families, build a monument on the borders, and create fine commerce with a fresh new open borders to help Armenians, our former citizens.",,/r/europe/comments/dvvssd/announcement_provisional_policy_change_with/f7jrcf3/,orderabi,1573784552

You people really are just empty of anything but nonsensical platitudes aren't you? Just completely clueless...

If you choose to not understand the point that's on you. 

Clearly they are burning coal now. At a per capita level there emissions are nowhere near the level of the west. Instead of letting their emmisions get to that level they will move directly to more sustainable forms of power. Now that I have spelled it out hopefully you understand.



&gt; Maybe 100 years from now.

Its already happening. Solar power is way cheaper now due to development by the West. Morocco for example is now using this to develop a huge power plant that will provide a large part of its power consumption.
