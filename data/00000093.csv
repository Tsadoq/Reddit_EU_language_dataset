18,"I'm way too old to engage in an argument about religion, but....

Religious service should absolutely not take precedence over cinemas or any other similar entertainment where people go to de-stress and forget about reality for a while. They are the same thing, escapism. I really don't see why people with certain beliefs should get preference over others, that is really not fair and totally unbecoming of a modern nation. If cinemas opened and not churches, that would be seen as a denial of the rights of a subsection of the population, and rightfully so.

The Church has far more money in the trunk than cinemas. Why should a church  open back up for business when they have colossal reserves to keep the business running into the future while cinemas, especially independent ones, will likely go bankrupt without the same government help. Why should the much larger and more economically stable business get preference over the smaller, yet every bit as valuable ones?

We may disagree on how important religion is, but at the end of the day it fills the same hole in peoples lives as the fantasy world of movies, theater etc. If we disagree on both being different forms of entertainment, at least we can agree that they are both equal forms of escapism.",,/r/europe/comments/glb72i/the_italian_state_is_a_lay_democratic_republic/fqwqc6b/,HungryLungs,1589713987

Certainly, I would not want anyones religion take precedent over anyone elses, so I am just as willing to extend the same liberties to Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and whatnot. 

Also, look, I'm an economist myself, and in many structures the Church(es) certainly are businesses, but allowing them to reopen is less about funding their business than them providing necessary services. The services provided by a church and by a cinema are only similar in the most idealized microeconomic sense, but from a humanitarian perspective they differ by a *lot*. I would never say that cinema, or arts in general, offers the same service as religion because anyone who worships art as a religious person worships god would be met with extreme caution by me. Art is humans expressing compassion to another. Religion is about finding comfort in higher powers. That's just incomparable.

And sure, many will argue that religion is man-made, but that's beside the point as long as religious people so strongly keep it in their lifes and beliefs. Religion is an inequally stronger force in peoples lifes and cultures compared to the escapism offered by arts.

As of this day the opinion polls have him (with 16% of the votes) right after the incumbent president Andrzej Duda (supported by 43,2%). Rafał Trzaskowski is fairly liberal, even for the Party’s standards (which in the end is somewhere in the centre or centre-right).

157,"On the North of England. You are right in that is has historically been Labour and Labour only but over the last 5 years Labour has moved more to the left and almost left the working class behind I favour of things the middle class care about. Things like an overbearing focus on ""social justice"", a push for hate speech laws, the move to a left wing party rather than centre left, etc have alienated those working class voters, imo because its hard to care about what pronoun to use when you are working pay check to pay check. Brexit also was a turning point, labour purposefully didn't express their opinion on brexit which really didn't sit well with much of the north that did vote for brexit, further pushing them away. Even though Labour is seen as the left wing party, the more successful Labour governments (like Tony Blair) were criticised for being tory-lite. Britian as a whole is extremely central on most issues and have rejected far left and far right views almost for the entirety of British history. 

I could be wrong but I'm part of the swing group myself and many I spoke to agree but I can only speak for myself. I only ever voted for Labour up until the most recent election where I voted Conservative, not because I wanted to. Despite voting remain myself, the attempt from Labour and other pro remain parties to subvert the democratic vote really didn't sit well with me at all. To many working class people their vote is the only way they can get themselves heard (they don't have any capital to spur change) and that being taken away from them would've caused riots ime.

You can practice religion all you want in the comfort of your home, nobody is denying that right. Going to the church is a separate question. 

You can't allow random stuff just because it's part of a religion. Think about it this way, what if a certain religion had ""going to the cinema"" as a primary way to worship their deity? Would you then be ok with reopening the cinemas? 

What is your authority to declare that people that want to go to the movies aren't as much in their right as people that want to go to the church? What's the fundamental difference? 

They are all people that feel distressed, have a long tradition of going to their ""church"" of choice, they will feel better afterwards, they will probably spread the virus in the process.

213,"Most social media is biased towards the left wing, reddit especially so it's absolutely not an indicator of the thoughts and sentiments of any age group or demographic.

Left wing view point are often much easier to ""score points"" with as they are often compassionate arguments which take little to no explanation which is suited for short text comments such as these. It's much easier to say I think we should let all immigrants in because think of the women and children, than it is for someone to refute that point in the same amount of time. Same for benefits/welfare. The argument against the compassionate (though not always right) view point is much more complex and takes more fleshing out to be fully understood. This is doubly true for places like reddit that are outright hostile to right wing ideas and if they aren't explained fully (sometimes even if they are) you run the risk of being labelled a racist or some other trope. There's so much of this in this thread alone, the people above defending those that voted for brexit because they are being assumed as xenophobic and racist 🤦‍♂️. 

In my own experience, before I got in to politics and philosophy I was a staunch left winger. I had never really read much other than newspaper headlines and a few articles here and there and because of what I mentioned above I rejected most right wing view points entirely because I never spent the time to understand the reasoning why.

Now I consider myself much better versed in the world of politics, have read many books surrounding politics in the UK and Europe and have definitely shifted to the centre over time. I see the left leaning political alignment to almost be the default starting place for most given how little reading and understanding is needed to agree with the viewpoint, that's just my analysis based on my experience and those I know in real life who occupy those left wing views despite not being ""in to politics"" at all.",,/r/europe/comments/gkqitt/attitude_towards_homosexual_people_in_the/fqwckyh/,q1a2z3x4s5w6,1589699671

The first point is what does that have to do with Germany raping Europe, then the Russians having their way with it for the next 50 years. Both of them destroyed your beastly continent but it is somehow Britain’s fault? Britain was fighting in North Africa and in Italy. Spent the entire wealth of a century of empire to defend Europe and win back democracy, for what? For the clownish countries of Europe to forget about the two previous times Germany tried to take over Europe and hand them the power to do it a third time.


&gt;Even your companies here exploit workers and fight against unions. 

You mean employ them? Just because you spend half a century under the Soviet yoke doesn’t mean that the unions are king. Fighting for workers rights is a good thing but every union by their very nature has a political agenda.


&gt;If that's what respect is then thanks I am choosing the Germans


Doesn’t surprise me to be honest, you chose them in WW1 and then again in WW2, helping them commit their crimes. Perhaps if your people had been more committed to democracy then as you claim to be now, perhaps you could now hold your heads up high.

It's beyond any debate that Reddit is overally left wing, especially in the Angoshpere with Dems and Labour beeing super popular as opposed to Republicans and Tories.

On the other hand I think it doesn't do justice to say that every social media is left wing. It all depends on how much of a representative sample of society a social media site is. In this sense Reddit obviously fails, but in my opinion, every nation has one site that's more or less representative since most of society has people there. For us that's obviously Facebook with a lot of users in the country. That, while not perfect gives a better idea about the society as a whole.

&gt; They could do way better with deportations as well as with controlling who enters in them in the first place.

I'm sure that they could deport more people.  It would probably be economically disadvantageous to the country to do so.

&gt; They could fight trafficking way better than they do today and they could take the number of immigrants they would like to accept through a fair process. They obviously choose the illegal way.

The reason people don't immigrate legally is because they wouldn't be *permitted* to do so.  Even aside from potentially-insurmountable political hurdles (e.g. domestic workers worried that they might see competition and that their wages might be negatively-impacted aiming for a protected labor market), it quite likely would be disadvantageous to the country as a whole if they did so and welfare costs exceeded the economic benefits that their labor generated.

Here's Milton Friedman — Nobel laureate economist, on team that designed US income tax system, arguing that in a welfare state, illegal immigration is a desirable feature, as it permits obtaining labor without paying for welfare.

386,"Text: 

David Frost, the prime minister’s chief Brexit negotiator, has given the European Union a two-week ultimatum to change course in trade and fisheries talks and accused Michel Barnier of putting ideology before getting a deal.

Post-Brexit talks have hit an impasse six weeks before a legally binding deadline expires ruling out any extension to the transition period.

“We made very little progress towards agreement on the most significant outstanding issues,” Mr Frost said. “It is hard to understand why the EU insists on an ideological approach which makes it more difficult to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. We very much need a change in EU approach for the next round beginning on June 1.”

Mr Barnier, the EU’s lead negotiator, said there was “incomprehension on the British side of the conditions for access to our market”. He added: “I’ve invited the UK to change tactics, to change strategy if they really do want to strike an agreement. There seems to be a real lack of understanding.”

The next round of talks is due in two weeks. Both chief negotiators are effectively talking past each other as the June 30 deadline to avoid a no-deal cliff edge in December by extending the transition period approaches.

A British source said: “It’s a matter of EU law and withdrawal agreement, that it is immutable. It doesn’t matter to us because we don’t want an extension and we wouldn’t ask for one.”

Next week the government will publish draft legal texts that have formed the basis of its negotiations this month in an effort to unblock the talks. The problem, Mr Frost said, is the EU’s demand that Britain align with EU legislation under the jurisdiction of the European courts, a “line in the sand” that Mr Barnier knows is politically impossible for Boris Johnson.

“The major obstacle is the EU’s insistence on including a set of novel and unbalanced proposals on the so-called ‘level playing field’ which would bind this country to EU law or standards, or determine our domestic legal regimes, in a way that is unprecedented in free trade agreements,” he said.

British sources said Mr Frost had offered binding independent arbitration in disputes over unfair competitive behaviour. The EU refused to discuss it, they said, and renewed a demand that Brussels state aid rules apply fully on UK territory.

Mr Barnier said: “The United Kingdom has not engaged in a real discussion on the level playing field.”

The EU has pointed to British demands on rules of origin, mutual recognition of products, and food safety rules to argue that Mr Frost seeks all the benefits of single market membership without the obligations.

Mr Barnier said: “If the British still want an economic and trade agreement then there are other conditions which will be linked to our own sovereignty.

“That’s what the British haven’t fully understood. We’re not going to let the third country set the conditions for access to our market.”

British officials have been angered that the EU slowed talks in key areas until Britain makes concessions on fisheries and the “level playing field”. A source said: “The commission obstructed progress on the basis that the discussions were moving faster than other work-streams, and set conditions for discussing services in the next round.”

The CBI said businesses already struggling with the coronavirus crisis would be worried by the lack of progress. Josh Hardie, its deputy director-general, said: “With a recession looming and company Brexit preparations stalled, it is important that a cliff-edge at the end of the year is avoided.

“The best way to help companies is for both sides to keep their options open, seek an ambitious deal and leave enough space to get implementation right first time.”",,/r/europe/comments/gkxpx0/change_tack_or_there_will_be_no_brexit_trade_deal/fqw9oy8/,PastTense1,1589696967

*May 17, 2020 13:24 JST*

MOSCOW -- China's coronavirus aid has earned mixed reviews in Europe at best, but it appears to be working as advertised in Belarus -- apparently at Russia's expense.

Over the past month, China has sent three cargo planes to the small Eastern European nation, carrying over 82 tons of rapid testing kits, masks, protective suits, respirators and other medical equipment. Another shipment is due to arrive later this month.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko sent a telegram to Chinese leader Xi Jinping earlier this month thanking him for the assistance and inviting him to visit this summer. ""Our joint efforts to overcome temporary difficulties have once again confirmed the strong friendship and the special nature of the Belarusian-Chinese partnership, \[and\] have filled relations between the two countries with special trust and solidarity,"" Lukashenko wrote.

The difference in tone -- compared with Lukashenko's recent exchanges with his country's longtime partner Russia -- was striking. Just last month, he accused Moscow of displaying ""national egoism.""

The neighbors' widening rift and the deepening Minsk-Beijing ties make for an awkward and delicate diplomatic triangle on the fringes of Europe.

Belarus has turned to China not only for medical supplies but also financial assistance as the pandemic induces a global economic downturn. Minsk is in talks with the Beijing-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank for a $350 million loan to support two state-owned banks, and has reached out to the China Development Bank for funding as well.

This follows Belarus' emergence as one of China's closest Eastern European partners in recent years. The volume of Chinese investment into the Belarusian economy increased by 200 times over the past decade, as Beijing sought to develop the former Soviet republic into a major hub for its Belt and Road Initiative. The Great Stone Industrial Park, a 112-sq.-kilometer business center just outside Minsk, carries the distinction of being China's largest economic project abroad.

Now, although some coronavirus-hit countries have questioned the intentions behind Beijing's ""mask diplomacy"" and complained about [substandard equipment](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Bad-masks-China-clamps-down-on-suppliers-after-European-outcry), Belarus has only tightened its embrace of China -- and pushed Moscow away.

Russia and Belarus signed a treaty to establish a union state two decades ago, but the project has largely remained on paper. Lukashenko, who has ruled his country since 1994, has bristled at pressure from the Kremlin to pursue deeper integration, accusing Moscow of trying to ""swallow up"" its smaller neighbor.

This year, Minsk and Moscow have sparred over the appropriate response to the coronavirus.

Belarus, despite confirming about 27,000 cases and over 150 deaths, is one of the few countries to avoid the mass quarantines and travel restrictions imposed across Europe and much of the world. Lukashenko has repeatedly mocked concerns about the outbreak as a ""psychosis"" and declared that Belarusians should protect themselves by drinking vodka and bathing in saunas.

This lax attitude alarmed Russia, which closed their shared border on March 16, provoking a furious response from Lukashenko. He said he had not been consulted and warned, ""It is easier to shut down something or to start a war than to find a way out of this situation.""

Moscow fired back, stating it had been forced to close the border because Minsk did not take sufficient precautions.

Then, after Russia donated 10,000 test kits to Belarus in early April, Minsk grumbled that many were inaccurate.

On the other hand, in the interview where he lamented Russia's ego, Lukashenko made a point of praising China. ""This country helps a lot and behaves in a polite and decent fashion,"" the president said. ""China can help through investments and is helping with millions of dollars.""

Arseny Sivitski, director of the Center for Strategic and Foreign Policy Studies in Minsk, said the Belarusian leadership greatly appreciates that China, unlikely Russia, did not criticize their coronavirus response.

Russia, which is [struggling to contain its own outbreak](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Datawatch/Russia-and-Brazil-becoming-new-epicenters-of-coronavirus), ""is trying to seriously push this issue, which Belarus regards as a form of interference in its internal affairs,"" Sivitski said. ""At this same time, China is confirming through practical steps that it regards Belarus as a strategic partner.""

A key question is how this apparent ""soft power"" win for China might affect Beijing's relations with Moscow.

The Kremlin, so far, has refrained from publicly expressing concern about China's growing influence in Belarus. Dmitry Bolkunets, an expert on Russo-Belarusian relations at the National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow, suggested that although Russia increasingly regards China as a competitor there, it remains confident about its own ability to wield influence over the long term.

""Russia understands the capabilities of Alexander Lukashenko and the capabilities of Belarus, and it is fully aware that Minsk won't be able to replace Russia,"" he said.

Moreover, Bolkunets argued, Russia and China are unlikely to squabble over Belarus because they share a common interest in opposing political revolutions in the country. Neither side wants to see Minsk move too far into the West's orbit.

But other experts stress that Belarus is eager to lessen its reliance on Russia by aligning itself closer to China -- an opportunity the coronavirus pandemic provides.

""Belarus wants to cooperate with China because there are no direct threats or political games with them,"" said Siarhei Bohdan, an analyst at the Minsk-based Ostrogorski Centre.

""With Russia, on the other hand, there always is a downside,"" he added. ""Despite our cultural closeness and extensive experience of cooperation \[with Moscow\], we have to deal with numerous political side effects and often times incorrect conduct from the Kremlin, who believes that it can ignore its Belarusian ally.""",,/r/europe/comments/gl9nx7/china_scores_points_over_russia_with_mask/fqw3n9y/,johnruby,1589691924

 Incorrect. From the EUs own website:

&gt;Consultation. The European Parliament may approve or reject a legislative proposal, or propose amendments to it.

The committee that initially draws up the proposal also gets a vote. Those committees are made of MEPs.

And even if they don't amend, they can reject proposals, which has much the same effect.

&gt;Also it isn’t remotely Democratic if a tiny country like Luxembourg has one commissioner and a huge country like France, Germany or the UK also has one commissioner.

One country, one vote. 

That's a form of democracy; that you don't like it doesn't change that fact. Would you rather have the voices of smaller countries utterly outvoted by larger countries?



&gt;What do you mean?

No UK government has won more than 50% of the vote since 1931. And even then they only got 42% of the total electorate to vote for them.

The UK's system allows governments to win majorities on a minority of the votes. That's totally undemocratic.

And that's not even getting into the fact that every single voter in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland (and a huge chunk of the north of England) could vote for the Fukit party and we'd *still* get a Conservative government.

St. Petersburg was not as secure during the civil war either, and during WWII it was really in a precarious position because (although some civilians were evacuated beforehand) the Germans and Finns encircled the city and would not let any food in during the siege. Over a million civilians starved to death and the fighting was intense. They were able to establish what was called the Road of Life by creating paths for trucks and even train tracks over the ice on the massive neighboring Lake Ladoga to provide a measure of relief, but it’s still one of the most deadly battles in all of human history.

Korea and Vietnam were divided up at the end of ww2, with the intent that elections to unify them respectively would be held. Since the Communists were the primary resistors of the Japanese, and the us represented the former colonial powers side, everyone knew the Communists would win the elections. So the us rigged the elections in their zones of control and then denied any unifying elections. The communist halves took this as a breach of the agreement and attacked with the intention to unify by force. In Korea's case the Soviets were abstaining the un in protest at China's exclusion (the PRC, china was then represented by Taiwan as the ROC with us support in preventing the end of the Chinese civil war) so the us got a UN mandate for ""police actions"" to intervene. North Korea conquered the peninsula with the help of Soviet equipment and MacArthur got to retry his disastrous Italy strategy and bisect the peninsula, but when he pushed to China's border he opened his fat mouth and proclaimed he was going onward to Beijing, at which point china poured over the border and pushed the UN back to the starting line. South Korea went on to suffer several dictators that had the sole intent of building up Korean industry to match the west (going from below Mozambique's level of development to past many Western European countries in 40 years with a mixture of protectionism, industrial ""espionage"" and maintenance of the Japanese window guidance method of directing economic investment), at which point they mostly transitioned to democracy. This was largely only possible due to the us only being interested in their survival as a base for us force projection in Asia, and therefore had every interest in allowing and encouraging this development.

Some obviously will have to move most wouldn't though. The money, from the US of course; maybe possible EU if Macron still pursuing pushing EU softpower expansion. Palestinians would have to persuaded by Financial incentives and long term stability mainly, also the hope that one day a large Arab nation will be strong enough to demand more from Israel. 

Now obviously many things can be changed, I just think something resembling that is the most realistic option.

756,"&gt; Poland and Germany should remind each other that both of them share a national obsession descending from a historical reality: Being cleft entwine between the east and the west and having to fight both of them at once.


Poland had to fight both of them at once because it was invaded by both of them at once in 1939 under an agreement between the eastern and western forces to invade at the same time. 

Germany had to fight both of them at once because it made a conscious decision to invade one of them to the west (France and Low Countries 1940), then a year later made another decision to invade to the East (decision to invade USSR 1941), while at the same time making a decision to randomly declare war on another of them even further to the west (US 1941). 

&gt; The only difference is the way both countries are mitigating the problem: For Germany, it was ""strike first, strike fast and fight on foreign soil"" whilst Poland looks out for someone to take care of it.

Because we have three genders in the language, and the middle gender (neutral) is used for things.

All our words have genders (or wast majority of them like 99,999%), and half of the sentence (meaning other words) has to change with the gender. So such proposal is either impossible in slovak language, or trans people would be referred to as of things (which is being used as offensive talk if you talk to someone with neutral gender as of a thing, taking his personality/human scale).

But instead you choose to go through mental gymnastics, which tells me you have an ulterior motive.

&gt;You are delusional man go look at your own history in Africa

There he goes again with the classic:

""Other countries did genocide, so therefore genocide is fine lol""m

Would you be ok if a Neo-Nazi came up to you and said:

""The Holocaust wasn't bad because every country has done genocide, the German people have nothing to apologize for!""

Would this be a defensible statement to you? Because you're literally doing this exact argument.

Any Crimea-like region in the world would do the same. Russia was and is pretty stable with a stronger economy than Ukraine. Not saying what Russia did was okay, it's a pretty scummy thing to do to your neighbor. Its equally pathetic John Mccain giving speeches to Ukrainian nationalists in Maidan. How I see this is: Russia lost control of the EU loving Ukraine so when it was inevitable that Ukraine will not be an ally of Russia anymore, Russia pulled the strings as though running from an collapsing tunnel and as the last escape push - got the Crimea, circumstances were horrible but complete democracy and legal. Wasn't Crimea announced that they are the Autonomous Republic when it was all happening and formally asked Russia to help them from the Ukraine army? I am sure, it was it.

Polls didn’t think the UK would vote to leave, and we still don’t know what kind of relationship we will have with the EU once the current withdrawal agreement terminates. We will have to see. Maybe rep of Ireland wouldn’t want NI anyway because it’s a net tax benefactor and would become the Irish republic governments problem.


2. I’m not denying that the British government encouraged loyalist settlers from Scotland. However at the formation of the partition, majority of the counties that formed NI had majority pro uk pop. Only two counties had slim pro-Ireland pop. And that’s why the pop of NI wouldn’t accept being part of an independent Ireland in my opinion. The fertile farmland may have been the reason why the uk government wanted this area to remain part of the UK, but I don’t think that was the reason the people of NI wanted to remain part of the UK.

&gt;No, the assault on the newly formed nation was not the logical response nor justified, as that was a UN decision on the future of the British territory. 

Israel's independance declaration was not an UN decision, I don't know how you got to that. What the UN voted that day was the infamous UN Resolution 181, it divided Palestine into an Arab and a Jewish state with Jerusalem governed seperately from those 2 states. 

The Jewish didn't agree with it, neither did the Palestinians. Clashes errupted, with Jewish militias acting more violently while acting out more and more terrorist bombings, massacres, etc untill the British left Palestine after which the Jewish had room to declare Israel independant and stole Palestinian land.

Palestinians were forcefully removed from newly formed Israel which lead to refugee problems in neighbouring states, hence the reason why that day is called the Nakbah ('The Catastrophe').",,/r/europe/comments/gk9hc1/united_nations_vote_on_the_territorial_integrity/fqtbgc6/,SaifEdinne,1589635323
1166,"Yes it does. Here's a little bit of reading on draconian measures taken by the Yugoslav state during the 90s on Kosovo Albanians. I'll highlight some important parts.

**Political disenfranchisement**

* “On 23 March, the Kosovo Assembly, born in the Constitution of 1974, voted itself out of existence by accepting the new constitution proclaimed in Serbia. That decision was made against a backdrop of 'hundreds' of political arrests and the stationing of tanks and armoured cars throughout the streets of Pristina, including the entrance to the assembly.”

**Military occupation via police and army**

* “Milosevic disbanded the province’s Albanian police force and replaced it with 7,000 Serb and Montenegrin officers, soon increased to 13,000 and supplemented by 21,000 armed reserves, for a total of 34,000 pro-Belgrade forces.”

**Cultural elimination**

* “In 1991 the Serbian regime began a campaign of Serbianising all public discourse in Kosovo, rendering public signs and processes utterly alien to many Kosovar Albanians. The Serbianisation of public life extended to the media. Television was directly controlled from Belgrade and became a crucial propaganda tool for Milosevic. The most widely distributed newspapers were brought under de facto state control. In 1990, *Rilindja*, the only Albanian language daily newspaper in Yugoslavia, was closed down with the loss of 1,300 jobs”

**Economic impoverishment and apartheid**

* “Unlimited powers were granted to enterprise managers, giving them the opportunity to dismiss Kosovar Albanians en masse from their jobs ostensibly on the premise of their political convictions.”
* “Milosevic provided ample scope for Serbian enterprise owners to remove Albanians from the official economy. According to an Amnesty International report in 1998, 'following large-scale dismissals from state enterprises, most Albanians are dependent on income from small businesses, or, often, money from relatives working abroad'. The authorities often cut off this form of income however, because 'people bringing foreign currency from abroad are often the targets of police road checks, frequently leading to the confiscation of the money and illtreatment'.”
* “As a result of the mass dismissals, it was estimated that by the beginning of 1998 unemployment in the Kosovar Albanian community was higher than 70 per cent. Whatever work was available was most often in the service sector, small commerce and the more lucrative international organisation sector and the black market. According to the Pristina Economic Institute in 1996, money earned by Kosovar Albanians through regular paid work amounted to just ten per cent of total earnings, while the black economy accounted for up to 60 per cent of total economic activity. The economic apartheid imposed by Belgrade was directly aimed at impoverishing the already poor (by Yugoslav standards) Kosovar Albanians. ‘
* “New factories were only built in areas predominantly inhabited by Serbs, and recruitment opportunities in new state-supported enterprises were only offered to Serbs. Elez Biberaj is right to surmise that economic apartheid was part of the Serbianisation plan discussed above. He argues that Serbian policies 'essentially amounted to a man-made famine'. If this was the plan, it appeared to be working. Shortly before the completion of the Dayton negotiations, *Rilindja*, which had relocated in Tirana, reported that between **1991 and 1995 more than 300,000 Albanians had fled from Kosovo to flee Serbian oppression and to find work abroad to pay for basic necessities.”**
* “Economic apartheid also extended to the healthcare system. The dismissal of Kosovar Albanian doctors, producing an 'ethnically pure' healthcare system in which prescriptions could only be written in the Cyrillic script. The result was that between 1992 and 1996 the incidence of preventable disease increased dramatically among the Kosovar Albanian community. In this period there were over 5,000 cases each of measles and tuberculosis. In 1996 it was left to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization and a Kosovar humanitarian organisation, 'Mother Teresa', to provide vaccinations against polio for Albanian children - a vaccination offered to Serbs free by the state”

**Police brutality**

* “By the mid-1990s, institutionalized human rights abuses had significantly devalued the value of life in Kosovo. The state itself was institutionalizing violence and murder. In 1994, the head of the highest court in Kosovo bluntly stated that *'****when an Albanian is accused of violating the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, we can beat them and even kill them.”***
* “Amnesty International reported in 1994 that the police used violence on a daily basis and with impunity. The report continued by stating that 'thousands of ethnic Albanians have witnessed police violence or experienced it at first hand'’
* **“hundreds of cases in which Kosovar Albanians were subjected to systematic torture in custody, a system supported and perpetuated by the judiciary** in flagrant breach of Yugoslav law. ***In five cases during the summer of 1998, police torture resulted in the death of the victim***. The report stated that 'all these cases involved young, healthy men who were seen being taken away by the police, and then were returned to their families dead'”

**Serb Colonization**

* “Additionally, Serbia tried a second hand at altering the demographic situation in Kosovo in 1995, “On 11 January 1995, the Serbian Parliament passed the '***Decree for Colonisation of Kosovo of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia*****'**. For those Serbs wishing to move to Kosovo the state offered loans to erect houses and buy apartments, and offered plots of land free of charge. The dire, and worsening, economic and political situation in Kosovo meant that very few Serbs from Serbia took up the government's offer to return to the 'cradle of Serbian civilisation' (as Kosovo is often referred to). Colonisation thus became a forcible issue. Many Serbian refugees from Croatia were forcibly resettled in Kosovo in 1995. Thus, the government made it illegal for Serbs to sell property to Albanians; imposed hefty sentences on any Kosovar Albanian who avoided national armed service in Croatia or Bosnia-Hercegovina; made it very difficult for Kosovar Albanians abroad to return to Kosovo; and penalised Albanian families that had more than one child, while rewarding Kosovar Serbs for having large families”

In the end the states have control over what mandate they have given the EU based on their own interpretations of the treaties because that's where the sovereignty lies.

The real reason is because we don't give a fuck though, Germany was historically decentralized enough to allow for a multicultural region to work together without requiring you to gain independence from the whole. If anything, small city states and fiefdoms sought greater independence from bigger neighbors that dominated their politics. Like, no one gets angry when you call someone from Bavaria German, but call them Bavarian and they might rip your head off because they consider themselves Frankish instead. They can all coexist inside Germany, but not inside each other. It's the reverse in Spain, a lot of people in the Balears and parts of Valencia consider themselves Catalan rather than Castillian/Spanish due to the hated enemy being the Castillian crown rather than the fiefdom next door. They consider themselves more deeply part of a common Catalan identity than the Spanish identity and don't resent Barcelonians for their cultural dominance because they bond over common rejection of the far greater Castillian cultural dominance coming from Madrid.",United Countries of Europe,/r/europe/comments/gk54vn/i_have_made_a_countryballs_map_of_europe_what_do/fqt2axo/,OneJobToRuleThemAll,1589627544

Things like communalists, anarcho-communists, socialists in general often champion that sort of urban planning. The main idea is to strengthen community bonds, have everything close together within walking and talking distance and you get to actually know your neighbors, create opportunities to form friendships in your community, instead of having everything be atomized and seperated. The idea is also to reduce the use of individual transportation (aka, cars) as much as possible by having things in walking distance. It's convenient, obviously eco-friendly, and the idea is that when you're walking about your communal area, you have more opportunities to get to know people and that even just walking around helps the place feel tight knit and like a community. The communalists and ancoms will tell you that this only works when the community itself can run its affairs without a massive state trying to exert its power and agenda which may not be what the community wants, but that general community principle is the same.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/gkp50k/round_apartment_buildings_in_moscow_russia/fqt2duh/,1800Dank,1589627626

1275,"&gt; When these kinds of referendums happen in western Europe like Scots, Kosovo etc- its democracy 

Oh, you able to put two different stories in one sentence and show it like an ""example"". 

Scots referendum : passed by  the Scottish Parliament on 27 June 2013 and received Royal Assent on 7  August 2013 , taken place more than a year after. The army wasn't involved, all sides were free to agitate. ""White book""  released and negotiation with the government took place in case if the referendum will be positive 

Kosovo: referendum shortly before (in the historical terms) collapse of Yugoslavia, then war, then big players and UN joined and only after 10 years after their recognition was somehow solved. 

Russian style ""referendum"": invade with the army, block all possibilities for another side, suppress all not pro-russian movements/TV sources, blatant propaganda like ""10/100/1000/10000 buses/trains/planes with evil nazis are coming to kill ya, so vote for Russia""  use force on MPs to vote in parliament to initiate ""referendum"", that will take place in 10 days after the announcement, draw result and try to convince everyone that ""everything was legal"".

1496,"From [this academic article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15387216.2019.1593873):

&gt;The state-legitimating Ukrainian referendum of 1 December 1991 on independence for the country attracted only 54% of votes cast in Crimea, dramatically lower than the national average of 91%. The history of public opinion on the peninsula since reveals variable levels of support for joining Russia. Studies from the mid-1990s show majority sentiment for joining Russia among the Slavic population but quite different attitudes among Crimean Tatars. UNDP quarterly surveys (samples in Crimea of 1200) also show a consistent level of support for joining Russia in the range of 65–70%.

So, yes, a slim majority of Crimeans -- tiny margins compared to support in the rest of Ukraine -- voted for Ukranian independence. But since 1991, they have repeatedly reported their desire to either become independent or join Russia. And in fact in a 1994 referendum, 78% of the Crimean population voted to have greater autonomy within Ukraine and 83% voted to have dual citizenship with Russia. The government in Kiev ruled the referendum illegal.

What I said is true: It is absolutely the case that the majority of the Crimean people have for decades been expressing their desire to not be ruled from Kiev; they see themselves closer to Moscow.",,/r/europe/comments/gk9hc1/united_nations_vote_on_the_territorial_integrity/fqsppgc/,New__World__Man,1589614533

What I meant was that a policy decision that wipes out half a population will probably not be repeated in the near future. The same will probably be true for a decision that economically cripples a country. Whereas the policy considerations that finds the perfect balance between population health and economic prosperity will probably be copied en masse.

Democratic systems fail to couple voting behavior to long-term consequences, but a pandemic with such short-term consequences will absolutely result in public uprisings if there is clear evidence one solutions leads to better results then the other. The thing now is, we simply don't know what the best set of policy decisions to tackle these health, social and economic issues are.

So, when this whole ordeal is over the winning set of policy decisions will set the stage for the upcoming decennia whereas the failed decisions will be shunned. 

So indeed. Politics has nothing to do with genetics in its purest sense, but in a democratic system a high-impact event certainly has the ability to dictate politics for years to come.

Workers worked because they wanted to feed their families and live a better life, when the Soviet Union, Romania, etc, couldn’t provide that because of their terrible economic policies, and replaced it with “motivating the workers”. The system slowly corroded into complete and utter inefficiency. It became necessary for workers to steal from the job to survive, for officials to take bribes, etc.

1625,"&gt; So now you're deciding what counts and what doesn't count? Why doesn't Latin count? Hungarian isn't a romance language, it should count double

Because hungarians dont speak latin it was a language used in catholic church all across the continent are you actually so daft as to claim hungarians spoke latin in their day to day lifes!? :)

&gt; We have the word for Christmas from Bulgarian. You should read a lot more on this you have absolutely no clue about the topic.

Yes i do.. read  your own language it sounds like klingon to everybody else. Is the only one that has no common ground to any other languages spoken by europeans despite living together for centuries. If that is not a red flag for you is fine like i said is your little coping mechanism.

And the reason why it has not common things is because the population speaking it made no effort to co-exist but only to asimilate.

Like i said it was 1.5 mil hungarians in Romania in 1920 and 1.2mil in 2011 so your Romanianizations claims are poop.

Sure the population went thru a fascist regime, a 2nd world war, a communist regime that ended up with us shooting the guy, on christmas day, on national television but hey romanians were living grand and converting the hungarians right?:)

In 1989 Romania had 23 milion people now it has 19 milion.

So i guess while we were asimilating the poor hungarians that are still the same number as they started 100 years ago, we were also busy asimilating into non existance 4 milion of our own?

Or was it that because of the social and economical realities people migrated to other countries once the movement became possible?

&gt; If you want me to read more about how Hungarian people resisted all cultural influences then provide me something to read. I think you'll grow old trying to find a source on this bullshit.

1. A Dutch company located in Britain buying UK fishing quotas. 

2. A Dutch company in the Netherlands buying Dutch fishing quotas and catching that quota in the UK's economic waters.    
   
People are mostly referring to the 2nd scenario. But you are correct about the 1st scenario. A fleet in that situation could directly sell their fish in other EU countries. But it's possible that without a single market and open borders the fish would have to go through the UK first. This would not really have all that many benefits, since the UK exports most of it fish to the EU anyway. Selling it directly to a country keeps costs competitive with fishing fleets operating from that country.   
                     
In the second scenario the main issue would be a loss of access to the UK's exclusive economic zone waters. People seem to imply that this would raise the fish quota's for the UK, but in reality the other countries would simply try to fill their quota's elsewhere. For example by fishing near spawning grounds. And such a move would make it very unlikely that the EU would allow the UK to export fish to the EU easily.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/gk8a4z/eus_barnier_says_trade_talks_with_britain/fqrtnq1/,DomesticatedElephant,1589591659

A lot of Russian Jews also hold discrimination by Ukrainians a lot closer to the heart due to WWII. Essentially, a nationalist Ukrainian named Stepan Bandera collaborated with nazis against the USSR to achieve an independent Ukrainian state. Super polarizing figure in Ukraine nowadays.

1825,"“British” refers to people that come from the island of Great Britain rather than *exclusively* people that come from the sovereign state of the UK. So, independent country or not, anyone from the island will be “British” and can’t change that.

So in other words, it’s no more a political demonym than it is a geographical one. 

Sounds rather familiar to the (overwhelmingly) English people that think they’re not “European” because they have left the EU or for some other reason(s). Seemingly that’s not you, based on how you identified yourself. So you should understand the difference between a geographical and political demonym and also if it is exclusive or not. 

Any “culture” that comes from the island of Great Britain is British and you don’t get to decide who you “share” that with and it’s not political. If we stop sharing an island somehow then you can use your own label as you like, whatever that will be. I also do not believe in breaking up the Union, in case you assume otherwise. What you said has the same logic as if a Scottish Nationalist said they don’t want to share the label “British” with you because they disagree with you politically.

The independandist movements across the world are born from multitude of reasons, but often historical (Corsica is more or less the last major territory which was added to France in the late XVIIIth century), cultural (Corsican have their own language, closer to Tuscan than french) geographical (Corsica is litterally 160km away from France separated by the sea and closer to Italy with only being 10km away from Sardinia) their legitimacy or not is in the end often decided by... their success.

I was only merely replaying to this particular statement

""But actually the majority is against independence.""

When latest elections showed the nationalist movement won with a big margin with 56% with the second party at 18% also being regionalist. Mind it doesn't look they are straight up asking for an independance referendum (or are they ?) but it does seem like the end result they are striving for.

i can get how the rest of my post could be interepreted as a rant about being cautious of conventional wisdom,  but wasn't about the particular case of Corsica at all

""Mainland France actually gives a lot of money to help Corsica, which couldn't live on its own realistically, and Corsicans know it very well.""

Of course economically it doesn't make any sense, but I don't think it's about economy at all there, that ""Corsica"" couldn't live on its own is an overstatement though, it ""could"", it would most likely be in for a rude awakening and be in a rough situation but it's not like the island would suddenly be closed of from France and the world overall and unable to sustain itself.

1948,"**A short excerpt from the article off the Ministry's official website:**

*The Minister of Justice has awarded a ""Judicial Merit"" medal to Zuzanna Wiewiórka - a volunteer for the PRO - Prawo do Życia (""A Right to Live"") Foundation - who, fighting in the name of the article 38 of the Polish Constitution that protects Polish people's lives, was met with a wave of hate and threats.*

*""For a loud voice of resistance in a situation where it's easy to stay silent. For a fight for the human life and abiding by the law. For bravery, lack of indifference and determination. There are many reasons for which Ms. Zuzanna Wiewiórka deserves this award. [...]"" - said vice-minister Marcin Romanowski who came up with the initiative to award the Medal.*

**Who is Zuzanna Wiewiórka?**

Ms. Zuzanna has been relentlessly prowling various Facebook support groups for women seeking safe pregnancy termination and threatening to report those who helped provide it (aiding in ""unlawful"" abortions - in Poland, ""lawful"" means ""when the mother's health is in danger, when there is a serious risk of fetal impairment or when the mother was raped"" - is punishable by up to 3 years in prison).

She's encountered a 17 year old girl and - when pestering her did not work - she and fellow ""volunteers"" stalked the teenager and contacted her parents who have forced her to deliver the baby under the threat of throwing her out of home. The desperate teen tried to perform an amateur abortion several times - unsuccessfully. Her physical and mental state are in decline.

Ms. Zuzanna has also made some comments regarding destroying abortion clinics, stating that ""If there are no people inside they can be destroyed just like other buildings built for killing people"" and, regarding the case where somebody is inside them, ""It's up for discussion. You can kill in defense and if the abortionist does X abortions every day then killing him is stopping him from killing innocents. Still, that's a topic for people smarter than me"".

Short note: I don't condone threats and I don't think that saying she should be ""fucked with a knife"" (direct quote) is reasonable, wise or something any decent human being should be doing. While I understand the emotions behind these comments and I believe Zuzanna along with her fellow pro-lifers is a deplorable, evil, horrible person - this is going way too far. I'm merely pointing out that the Ministry of Justice giving a medal for stalking teenage girls and ruining their lives in the name of medieval beliefs is a disgrace.

Turkey, on the other hand, is still in denial of Armenian genocide and other genocides and massacres. Not only that but many Turks still show the same attitude.   
  
&gt;But when our ancestors who we don’t even support do something everyone is blaming us.  
  
Who are your ancestors that you don't even support?  Sultan Selim the son of Roxelana or members of CUP who founded Turkey? The first one (Ottoman dynasty) aren't your ancestors. Your grandgrand parents were mere peasants as their muslim or non-muslim subjects in their domain while the sultans mostly came from non-Turkish mothers and were surrounded by devshirme ruling class by the time they captured Constantinople (although many Turks love to take credit for their glory). It was members of CUP that was running Ottoman Empire in her dying days and were in charge and responsible for Ottoman Empire entering WWI as German ally and also responsible for Armenian genocide.. 
   
And yes, people blame Turks not because the world hates them but because most Turkish people are still in denial about what some old men did 100 years ago and not taking responsibility to correct things unlike Germans which you brought up who took responsibility and corrected things so that Turks and other immigrants can live good lives in a liberal Germany today.  
   
I had a similar discussion with another Turk here sometime ago and cited Turkey's president Erdogan as one guy to have the balls to talk about [another massacre](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-15857429) and the guy quickly dismissed it as a ""conspiracy against Ataturk"".

Earlier this week, the government was still stating that they will declare the end of the epidemic at the earliest on the 31st of May as we still need to see what the effects of the relaxation of measures will be, while yesterday they suddenly did a 180 degree turn and suspended it immediately.

If we take this argument even further and according to you, Turkish people had absolutely nothing to do with the genocides and maybe they were even against it back then, why aren't you against it today?

The Chinese are another issue, but we do not have many Chinese here who come to deny it, otherwise I'd probably have this argument with them too.

I'm not saying it won't hurt them, but what does the UK actually *do* that is so irreplaceable to the Union?

&gt;Its one of the largest European economies and the EU is fucked if the UK reduces its imports from them

Personally I think they're fucked either way, but that doesn't mean the UK has enough leverage to matter in the short-to-medium term, particularly since the UK suffers from the same underlying issues as the rest of the power-players in the EU; bad demography.

&gt;The UK wants a Canada deal, The EU wants to offer a Canada deal but with loads of caveats and extra demands that it has not claimed from any other country it has trade deals with, The UK has refused.

Which is their right, but that doesn't mean their going to get a better deal in the long run. The EU also has every right to play hardball. This isn't to say that neither side will come away better than before, but the UK is going to end up hurting a hell of a lot more than the EU as a result of this.

Yeah the problem is that you're not pointing out that eating meat isn't a necessity, you're trying to justify the killing of wild animals for fun. Because that's what it is, sport, fun.

I don't need to have a counter argument because we are talking about opinions. I consider hunters to be barbaric, useless to society and in general violent people because of what they do.

It is not true that Merkel is the Kingpin in the party anymore, it is clear that there is currently a large power struggle between the different parts of the CDU that do what they want with little regard to Merkel's will.

Also, in Germany, the ministers have resort authority, meaning that, unless Merkel specifically takes an issue on herself, she has little controle over the ministers apart from releasing them from office. So, her being Chancellor has little to do if she supports the law or not. And with her having lost her controle over the parliamentary CDU years ago, she bears also no responsibility for the actions of the CDU as a whole.

Yes, she is the one holding the different parts of the government together, but especially she doesn't do it by imposing her will on them, because she first has no power or authority to do so, and second, that would bust this government in a moment.

Why build, when the old one's there and working?

Thus when they finally and irreversibly decide to turn them off, it's usually at too short notice. Even today, there's a very serious expectation that Belgium won't *actually* turn off all its reactors by 2025. The time scale is too short.

So what will happen is they'll be turned off, whenever it's deemed absolutely necessary, and will be replaced with gas power plants that can be built at shorter notice.

He said: “I should be clear about what I was trying to say, and if I didn’t say this clearly enough then I apologise.  “What I was trying to say was that, in the absence of a therapeutic, the way in which you can stop a community becoming susceptible to this is through immunity and immunity can be obtained by vaccination, or it can be obtained by people who have the infection.”](https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/sage-scientists-herd-immunity-for-tackling-coronavirus-1-6638746) 

As for the take it on the chin. This is not in any bloody way proof of a government policy. It is merely an expression used across the UK when facing hard times. It does not and cannot be framed as an official governmental response. You might as well call the famous stiff upper as an official government policy to starch our upper lips into a solid mass to prevent movement.

-edit- I forgot to mention. The day after the media ran wild with the “herd immunity” misunderstanding, every subsequent press briefing had the scientific advisors, medical experts and government official all reiterating multiple times, it is NOT a herd immunity policy. That we have a very clear policy of entering lockdown at the right time, to prevent fatigue setting in and a second peak.

Now. You can very rightly criticise the British government for relaxing lockdown too early as they are doing as we speak. Because we will probably now have a second peak in the UK in the next few months that will be worse than the first.

This is a very valid and scathing criticism you can level on them, one I would absolutely support you in making. Applaud you even. 

But the “muh herd immunity” LIE is absolute poison that this sub should be above spreading.

Hell, even a regional aspect differed - the experience of one living in a farm, in a small town, in Riga, in Kurland or in Vidzeme - was probably vastly different as well. 

A jew from Riga, obviously, suffered a bit from the Soviets in 1940, but the Nazis arriving in 1941 was hell for him. For Latvians the experience under the Nazis was no cake-walk, but certainly it must have felt like a different, maybe more relatable, demon to deal with. At the same time, the front line moved over us 2 time - the first one was relatively bloodless, but the experience in 1944 was hell for us here.

2686,"&gt;By this logic 20% of hungarians could become english

It's not a first language. I was talking about first language, that's what the century-old cencus counted too.

&gt;But why would a croatian father would not want his child to speak croatian too?

Why would a present-day Hungarian moving to Bucharest want his child to speak Romanian? Because that's the official language, that's what everybody else speaks, and he wants the child to be able to fit in. When you move into an environment where nobody speaks your language you want your child to speak the majority language.

&gt;but you cannot just argue that all mixed families just agreed between themselves to just round themselves up as 100% pure hungarians.

We aren't talking about just one generation. A mixed family will teach a child both languages, but if the child remains in an environment where nobody speaks the minority language he will likely not teach that to his child. Or even if he does, his grandchild might not. It is directly observable even today, assimilation happens everywhere even if there's nobody forcing it.

You simply can't tell if a 3rd generation immigrant counts himself as a nationality or as a Hungarian unless you ask them. That's why referendums would have been better like what they held in Sopron.

&gt;No i am saying that were plenty of non magyariars living inside Panonia too and the goverment just declared what they wanted is not like the grand majority of them knew how to write or represent themselves nevermind know about human rights or nationalistic states.

I won't take this without a credible source.

&gt;while the goverment would tag him and his ancestors as native hungarian

They wouldn't unless he declared at the census that Hungarian is their first language. What you propose here is a falsifying of a census on a gigantic scale that contradicts the reality observable today where there are still ethnic Hungarians living in Serbia and Slovakia along the borders. There were population exchanges with Germany and Czechslovakia too, so it's not like it was all magyarization and assimilation. By your proposal the current Hungarian population of Serbia, Slovakia and Romania (outside Székelyföld) should be counted as Serbians, Slovakians and Romanians against their will, just because hundreds of years ago one of their ancestors was magyarized.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/gj4ltg/romania_passes_law_celebrating_the_treaty_of/fqox491/,Nerevaryne,1589527546

Just because the American mentality is incapable of viewing a country's impact otherwise than through power over other countries doesn't mean what comes out of should be considered intelligent - quite the opposite.

There's maybe more wisdom in that stance than the Anglos give them credit. 

There's plenty of other, non power-politics-related areas where Germany could further the interests of the EU or that of it's friends.

Here is my unsolicited advice: buy a labrador, accept his affection, then when you are finally in a good place try to find an explanation as to why, in  a centuries old empire none of the majoritary non hungarian population living inside the empire's borders moved into Panonia?

The only logical answer is that they did but they got magyarized and the only reason the germans were sticking out was because it was harder to try and forcefully asimilate them compared to the others.

And if we take into account the fact that all those numbers were the ones reported by the hungarian goverment, based on the ethnical compositon of the empire and the fact that they all could move as they wished inside the empire's borders one can easily conclude that there were alot of non hungarians that moved and lived inside Panonia at least 3x the figure of 1.5mil that the hungarian goverment released.

Also could you please find a reasonable explanation as to why full blodded hungarians living inside the Panonia plain would  call themselves Croat? (2nd most common last name in Hungary is Horvath no?)

Here is another very common name: Slavic (Toth). Why would hungarians have Slavic as common last name?

And the list keeps going with: Németh	(German/Germanic), Oláh (Vlach/Romanian), Rácz (Serb, South Slavic)

And this is [the source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_common_surnames_in_Europe#Hungary) that has current data which means is 100 years and ww2 fascist and communist regimes past the situation after Trianon.

In 2001 4.6% of hungarians declared their ethnicity as unknown. [go to chapter 6 here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe#European_ethnic_groups_by_sovereign_state) literally no other country in Europe  had that but Hungary.

And, i repeat, all these figures are 100 years after Trianon, after the fascist and communist regimes and ww2.

Not to mention that the Hungarian goverment declared after Trianon that after living in same country with a multitude of other nationalities for centuries they are fully hungarian except some sandals wearing germans near lake Balaton while after 100 years another world war, communist regime with closed borders to prevent people from leaving the country, somehow, in 2001, just 90% of them are hungarians now!?

So by your logic when living in same country for centuries people did not move to the Panonian plains but after getting own countries and under communist regime where they were shot even if aproaching the border, somehow, roughtly 10% of the population became other than magyar...and 5% of them cannot even remember their relatives (must be from the shock and trauma experienced while trying to get inside Hungary in such draconic conditions).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/gj4ltg/romania_passes_law_celebrating_the_treaty_of/fqomcf4/,cipakui,1589518685

Clubs that have the most money traditionally get CL titles, that’s how it goes. If anything it shows how complacent the rest of Europe is to the rich boys club. There’s no financial fairness whatsoever.

France trains some of the best players in the world and continues to do so since the 80s. Sadly they mostly all play in Spain or the UK where they get more money, better chance at an European title, more prestige, better sponsor deals and better access to tax havens.

""The criminal offense of insult is committed by someone who insults another (Article 147, paragraph 1 of the CC). A fine of up to ninety daily amounts is envisioned as a punishment for this form of a criminal offense of insult.

A qualified form of the criminal offense of insult is committed by someone who insults another through the press, radio, television, computer system, or network, at a public gathering or in any other way, due to which the insult has become accessible to a larger number of persons. A fine of up to one hundred and eighty daily amounts is provided for the qualified form of the criminal offense of insult (Article 147, paragraph 2 of the CC).""

The main argument for it was that it would keep civil discourse alive, but the only time it was used (three times to be exact) it was to punish our media for not towing the party line and asking things politicians didn't want to answer. Since the whole thing is super broad it also used to keep citizens from openly saying anything bad about politicians because politicians could potentially sue you for an insult.",,/r/europe/comments/gjmnvo/french_social_media_law_is_another_coronavirus/fqo2l8e/,HistoricCthulhu,1589506284
2944,"&gt; According to the United Nations, Hiftar Government is an illegitimate regime.

So what? According to the UN, North Korea, Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, and the Central African Republic are all legitimate regimes. UN recognition means fuck all. 

&gt; Hifter is being backed by the Arab League and Russia.

&gt; Hifter, in order to gain support, signed $20 billion contracts with Russian Rosneft.Supplied permission to French oil giant Total to conduct offshore drilling in maritime borders.Agreed on the Greek Naval thesis and gave up 39.000KM2 of its territorial water.

...so? Are you saying that the Serraj regime [didn't](https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-and-libya-sign-deal-on-maritime-zones-in-the-mediterranean-149216) sign military and maritime border contracts with Turkey to gain support? 

&gt; The Tobruk regime utlizes the Sudanese Cancavid militias, the Egyptian Evladi - Ali mercenaries and Madkhali jihadists.Hifter forces are also backed by the Russian mercenary organization Wagner.

The Tripoli regime utilizes Idris Bukhamada's mercenaries, Tuareg mercenaries, Tripoli Protection Force mercenaries, Salafi jihadists from the Shura councils of Derna and Benghazi, Syrian mercenaries under Turkey's payroll. 

&gt; During the illegitimate war conducted by the Hifter leadership, 300.000 people had to immigrate, and 8000 civilians had lost their lives.

Where did you get these numbers? The total death toll of the war since 2014 is ~9000, and there's no way civilians made up 90% of this toll. 

Let's not pretend the GNA existed from the beginning. It was created in December 2015 and the House of Representatives voted against it in August 2016 (meaning that on paper, the HoR and the LNA by extension were part of the GNA for half a year). Haftar's war didn't become ""illegitimate"" in the eyes of the UN until after that; LNA was previously official armed forces of the the UN-recognized Libyan government (half of the deaths took place during this period).",Earth,/r/europe/comments/gjmiks/nato_ready_to_support_libyas_government/fqo2o2u/,wiki-1000,1589506331

Please tell me fans from an american football team that have the same passion of Lazio, Roma, Boca Juniors, River Plate fans. However that being said, this passion also leads to fighting, racism and other types of bad behavior. And as far as NFL and college american players playing in big crowds, doesn't really matter when the only thing those fans do is just say ""wooooo lets go ohio state"" or yell out ""bullshit"" and bring out marching bands to the field LMAO.

We don’t have to sign this deal if we don’t like it. That is the ultimate choice. And we do NOT need a trade deal. We could function quite easily without a deal with the US and see our mutual trade in increase YoY.

In reality, the majority of world trade since the dawn of mankind, has happened without a deal. It continues to happen right this very moment mainly without deals, and it will continue to do so for a long time.

A trade deal is NOT needed, especially one that causes more harm than good. And even the smallest countries on earth have the ultimate power of saying “nah it’s ok” to trade deals, if they think they are too bad.

3104,"If the law supposes that,” says Mr Bumble in Oliver Twist, “the law is a ass – a idiot.”

Judges are prone to unduly legalistic rulings that seem bizarrely out of touch with the real world, but perhaps no more so than in Germany, whose Federal Constitutional Court last week effectively determined that the European Central Bank’s (ECB) bond buying programme was illegal, or to be more precise, that the European Court of Justice’s (ECJ) prior approval of the programme was “incomprehensive” and “meaningless”.

The effect of the judgment is at one and the same time to challenge the higher authority of the ECJ and the independent right of the ECB to set monetary policy. It is an exocet aimed straight to the heart of the European Union and its monetary union.

Are the grey haired oracles who sit on the BVerfG, to give the court its German acronym, idiots or heroes?

In explaining himself, one of them suggested that he was fed up concerning himself with minority human rights issues and was instead siding with the “silent middle” in defending savers and pensioners from those who would destroy them.

Yet whether one sympathises with this mindset or not, this is not the moment to be dynamiting the entire stadium. To deliberately foment a constitutional crisis in the middle of an unprecedented medical and economic emergency is to pile Pelion on Ossa.

It is also a shameful indictment of Germany’s propensity to regard the EU as no more than a conduit for its own self interest, bending the rules when it suits but ruthlessly imposing them on others when it does not.

The Constitutional Court is of course not the same thing as the German government, some of whose members view the court’s kamikaze disregard for what’s going on in the outside world with the same horror as other EU member states. Some face-saving way of ignoring the court’s instructions will no doubt be found. 

The episode nonetheless highlights anew the inescapable fault lines of the Continent’s aspiring United States of Europe.

Let’s side pocket the point of principle here, which is whether it is Germany’s national court, or the European Court of Justice, that rules supreme, and instead focus on the judgment’s practical implications. By challenging the ECB’s right to monetise the debt of member states, the judges are in effect denying those states a perfectly legitimate and effective way of addressing the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.

In Britain, the only reason why the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, can afford to pay furloughed workers, guarantee bank loans, and generally ramp up spending against a backdrop of collapsing tax revenues is that the Bank of England is buying up much of the new debt the Government is issuing to fund the shortfall.

Similarly, its bond buying can be used to ease the kind of punishing post-Covid austerity imagined in an internal UK Treasury discussion paper leaked to the Telegraph this week. The same monetary therapy is being applied in the United States, Japan, China, and everywhere else with its own sovereign central bank.

If the likes of France, Italy, Spain, and Greece are denied that lifeline, they’ll go under as fast as a rusty ship in a storm. Brutal tax rises and spending cuts would indeed be their inescapable future.

It matters less to Germany, which is among the most solvent countries in the world, and can therefore easily afford to bankroll its pandemic response without recourse to monetary financing. 

As it is, and with treaties on state aid suspended, Germany has been throwing money at its economy on an almost unimaginable scale. Its judges seem to want to starve others of the ability to do the same. Far from being a benign economic hegemon at the heart of Europe, Germany finds itself accused of returning to its bad old imperialist ways.

For Americans, the defining economic experience of the last one hundred years was the Great Depression. Their biggest fear is mass unemployment. But for Germans it is hyperinflation, and the destabilising destruction of middle class savings that past episodes of it have visited on them. They have a consequent, almost pathological, aversion to debt monetisation.

The Constitutional Court therefore regards its ruling not as an attempt to weaken Europe, but “to strengthen it”. By defending the principles of sound money, the court lessens the risks of a populist backlash against the EU in its own backyard.

And therein lies the nub of the problem. What may be good for Germany and its immediate economic satellites is very probably bad for everyone else. In its supposed efforts to defuse populism in Germany, the court only exacerbates it elsewhere in Europe.

For all its pretence at solidarity, Europe can seemingly never escape these countervailing, centrifugal forces. If Germans don’t allow less solvent neighbours their monetary tranquilisers, the EU will splinter irreparably. The economic damage the pandemic has already inflicted on Europe will look like a mere war",/,/r/europe/comments/gjv6ah/selfish_germany_is_dynamiting_the_eurozone/fqn8xfu/,1NGR,1589490669

I don't know what you mean by ""capable enough"" or ""navigational systems"". Capable enough to do *what*? 

It *sounds* like this is talking about the British Trident II missiles, which are indeed US supplied. That's not a ""navigational system"" though; it's a delivery system. The rest of the tech on the submarines they're fired from is European.

The French don't use US systems. They have their own missiles (M45 and M51)

&gt; There was however pretty much consensus on the reading that the EU would not even judge themselves capable enough in that aspect if not for NATO (US) protection.

Much consensus by who? This just sounds either like typical US mental masturbation or a misunderstanding of terms. There's certainly an argument to be made that the French (in the wake of Brexit) deterrent is not sufficient for the EU as a whole, or that the EU needs its *own* communal nuclear deterrent rather than rely on a system under the command of a single memberstate.

Don't know means it could go either way: it could pretty much be done in Europe, but we could also have another 10 waves like the last one.

Besides that, MERS and SARS didn't 'fizzle out', they were rigorously 'dammed in', which was a lot easier in those cases since people were only infectious when they were ill, and virtually everyone infected got ill enough to notice.

Are most places ready for easing of some restrictions? certainly, but the damned thing about this virus is that you don't see any effects of policy changes until about 3 weeks later. So any easing should be done gradually and carefully, because if authorities make a mistake, they won't know until the problem is 3 weeks old and in reality about 100x worse (exponential growth over those 3 weeks).

And as for the economy, there was an opinion piece from a virologists who worked on the EU preparedness recently, that very nicely pointed out: it's the virus that's causing most of the economic damage, not the lockdowns. If people are getting infected and dying left and right, people won't just keep shopping for that new car/furniture etc. The economy gets hit regardless of the public health interventions.

Especially as Benfica and Porto being strong teams don't reflect the quality of the whole Portuguese league either. In terms of TV revenue Portugal is statistically the most unbalanced league in the whole of Europe, doesn't give a great impression for those small Portuguese clubs.

That's... *really* questionable. Russia may have a habit of declaring their systems to be the best in the world; but in reality, many experts would question the sophistication and effectiveness. And even if the claims were entirely accurate, it's highly unlikely that they (or indeed, any country's BMD systems) would have a 100% shoot-down rate, which is what you *really* need when facing the possibility of a retaliatory strike involving hundreds of nuclear warheads.

It doesn't matter if they could shoot down 95% of France's nukes. If only a couple make it through, the damage inflicted would still be catastrophic enough to make whatever hostile action precipitated the event not worth it for Russia to engage in. That's the whole philosophy behind the arsenals of France and the UK. One nuke could be shot down. Hundreds of nukes is enough to guarantee *some* will manage to hit their target.

3269,"&gt;Then massacres of Jewish settlers in Palestine in 1948 should be considered a continuation of the Holocaust.

These two things are completely different things, massacres of Jews in 1948 were committed by Arabs, while the Marash massacre was committed by the  same Ottoman Empire right after the Armenian Genocide.

&gt;The detainees in Malta were, for the most part, Freedom and Accord  members who had little to do with the CUP or their atrocities.

They were war criminals who were moved from Constantinople to Malta. Trying to paint them as innocents is whitewashing of history. By the way, your second Minister of Finance and Minister of Defence, [Abdülhalik Renda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd%C3%BClhalik_Renda), was among them, and he was responsible for extermination of Armenians in Der Zor and Bitlis Vilayet.

&gt;Ah yes, bringing people to the modern age by giving them surnames  is...ah yes, discriminatory! What other motive could there possibly  be???? /s

Well, you definitely needed to be brought to the modern age, but we Armenians already had surnames. Shocking, I know. And yet we were still forced to change them.

&gt;Not to add Ataturk did a lot of good for other  nations(signing the Balkan&amp;Sadabad Pacts, forming a stable corner in  the Middle East, backing the League of Nations against Italy,

Apparently these good things didn't apply to the minorities of Turkey.

&gt;and İnönü continued this by saving a few dozen thousand Jewish refugees  during the Holocaust&amp;helped Greece in its war against Italy. If that  is helping Turkey only

And at the same time Inonu adopted Varlic Vergisi.

&gt;you're delusional

Said the person who is trying to convince me that Inonu's obvious racist remarks weren't racist. You are totally not delusional /s

&gt;See above, the Turkish nation was based along civil lines, not ethnic or racial.

You are trying to alter the meaning of Inonu's words, it is pretty clear that in his racist statement he referred to Turkey's minorities, and the fact that the same man adopted Varlic Vergisi only proves my point.

&gt;Clearly these Armenians were allowed to identify as both Turks AND  Armenians and still rose up to rather important places in Turkish  society. This proves that the model of nationality was civic, instead of  the racial nonsense you're putting.

Just because these Armenians didn't face discrimination doesn't mean that other Armenians weren't subjected to it. And I am not even mentioning other ethnic groups. For example, Kurdish nationality and Kurdish language were banned in Turkey until 1990s, and Kurds were simply called as ""Mounting Turks"". Yeah, totally not racist.

&gt;In the end, I get why you hate him, but it is based on sentimental nationalism which probably belongs in the graveyard.

No, the idolization of Ataturk is a sentimental nationalism that needs to die in the graveyard. We hate him because of the massacre in Marash, I doubt you will understand that, cause you didn't get it the first time.

&gt;Just saw the rest of your post, mainly invading ""Armenia"" - well too bad, but that is called history, wars happen, people die.

I have to remind you that you are talking about 12000 deaths

&gt;If we're going to count any and all invasions as genocide we should start with Khojaly.

Ah, the whaboutism, again. Why not start from the massacre of Armenians in Sumgait? Or Baku? Or Kirovabad, or Maraga, or the Operation Ring? Oh, wait, I have a better idea, let's start from the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.

3328,"&gt; As for the Romanian-Hungarian border...It wasn't 100% correctly drawn I agree, but I'd say it's around 85% correct. 

True, and all I'm saying is that it could have been 95% correct instead with some minor adjustments. Same with Czechslovakia and Serbia, but those cases were far worse than the Romanian borders, especially with Vojvodina.

&gt; I want to remind you that the initial Treaty of Bucharest signed in 1916 by Romania and the Entente powers in order to join the war stipulated that the new border would be on the Tisa river. 

That would have resulted in decades of uprisings and possibly another open war during WW2. I hope you agree that the decision to not completely uphold these terms was a godsend to both countries.

&gt; As for the capital cities of those counties...well, they were surrounded by Romanian villages, so they ended up being given to Romania. 

Yes, and that was the right thing to do since the overall population was Romanian around those cities. But not the entire counties were majority Romanian, and that's where some further adjustments would have given a better result with those few Hungarian towns to the west. But again, that's not really the border where the worst of the problem lies, the worst was to the south and to the north.

&gt; Hungary would've been mad even if you got to keep those counties that I mentioned, let's be real.

I am %100 sure that you know Armenian rebellions in Van, Sason, Erzurum etc. and you know they killed civilians deliberately to become majority in the towns. All of these were documented in Niles and Sutherland's report which is also used by Harbord Commission. McCarthy found the copy of this report.

\&gt;  Actually, many historians consider them as a continuation of the Armenian Genocide

Then massacres of Jewish settlers in Palestine in 1948 should be considered a continuation of the Holocaust.

\&gt;  Can you provide your sources? Because, as I remember, Ataturk was opposed to trials against war criminals in Malta. He reasoned about the detainees in Malta on the occasion of the congress in Sivas 4 September 1919: ""...should any of the detainees either already brought or yet to be brought to Constantinople be executed, even at the order of the vile Constantinople government, we would seriously consider executing all British prisoners in our custody.""

The detainees in Malta were, for the most part, Freedom and Accord members who had little to do with the CUP or their atrocities.

\&gt;  Yes, but he was alive when the discriminatory [Surname Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surname_Law_(Turkey)) was adopted.

Ah yes, bringing people to the modern age by giving them surnames is...ah yes, discriminatory! What other motive could there possibly be???? /s

\&gt;  Now this is an exaggeration, the good things he did were only for Turkey and Turks, they didn't apply to all people. He created a Turkish state, which was only for Turks

And a Turk was classified as someone who ""calls themselves Turkish"". It is no more discriminatory in theory than the French model of citizenship. Not to add Ataturk did a lot of good for other nations(signing the Balkan&amp;Sadabad Pacts, forming a stable corner in the Middle East, backing the League of Nations against Italy, and İnönü continued this by saving a few dozen thousand Jewish refugees during the Holocaust&amp;helped Greece in its war against Italy. If that is helping Turkey only, you're delusional)

\&gt;  Your first Prime Minister Ismet Inonu said, ""*Only the Turkish nation has the right to demand ethnic and racial rights in this country*.

See above, the Turkish nation was based along civil lines, not ethnic or racial.

Oh and, I'm going to put this here:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ber%C3%A7\_T%C3%BCrker\_Keresteciyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ber%C3%A7_T%C3%BCrker_Keresteciyan)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagop\_Vahram\_%C3%87er%C3%A7iyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagop_Vahram_%C3%87er%C3%A7iyan)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agop\_Dil%C3%A2%C3%A7ar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agop_Dil%C3%A2%C3%A7ar)

Clearly these Armenians were allowed to identify as both Turks AND Armenians and still rose up to rather important places in Turkish society. This proves that the model of nationality was civic, instead of the racial nonsense you're putting.

In the end, I get why you hate him, but it is based on sentimental nationalism which probably belongs in the graveyard.

No they weren't that spread out. Southern Slovakia and Vojvodina were ethnic Hungarian blocks. Of course I'm not claiming that the 5% villages should have been counted too. Numbers as small as that usually just migrate, it would have sorted itself out.

3401,"&gt; Company bosses fear proposed measures could deprive them of crucial sources of capital

&gt; The details have yet to be finalised. But according to a draft seen by the Financial Times, the government is considering giving the country’s competition authority the power to block non-EU companies from taking stakes of more than 10 per cent in businesses deemed to be providing critical infrastructure, goods or services for a period of two years.

&gt; “We are saying clearly: Poland is not for sale in this crisis situation,” Poland’s deputy prime minister and development minister Jadwiga Emilewicz told Polish radio last month. “Polish companies, often family-owned, which over the last 20 to 30 years have painstakingly built up their brand, their reputation and contributed to the strength of the Polish economy, cannot today become cheap booty for funds, especially from outside the EU.”

&gt; Poland is not alone in looking for ways to block foreign takeovers of companies flattened by Covid-19. Amid concerns that Chinese state-owned groups could exploit the crisis to snap up European groups on the cheap, the EU’s competition chief told the FT last month that the European Commission would have no problem with EU states taking stakes in companies to stave off the threat of Chinese takeovers. Meanwhile, Germany has launched a €100bn bailout fund that will recapitalise and take stakes in German companies laid low by the crisis.

&gt; There are also reasons why Polish groups might be easier targets than those in western Europe. The fact that most Polish companies were founded in the 30 years since the collapse of communism means that they tend to be younger, and therefore smaller than peers elsewhere in Europe. They are also currently cheap: falls on the Polish stock exchange — the blue-chip index has lost almost a quarter of its value since mid-February — have been amplified by the drop in the Polish zloty, which has lost about 8 per cent against the dollar and renminbi since the start of the crisis.

&gt; “Given that the crisis does not have an economic background — it’s a pandemic that influenced the economy — we don’t want to have our companies bought by someone else, just because of this situation,” said Piotr Arak, head of the Polish Economic Institute, a government-backed think-tank.

&gt; More than half of inward investment comes from inside the EU and would therefore not be affected. But business leaders are still justifiably uneasy about the messages being sent to foreign investors. One concern is the fact that, according to the draft of the new rules, Poland would not just be able to block takeovers, but also any stake purchase of more than 10 per cent. This seems a low threshold if the aim is to prevent companies from coming under foreign control.

&gt; Maciej Witucki, head of Lewiatan, the Polish employers’ confederation, said another problem was that the provisions on which Polish companies would be covered by the new rules were so vague that they could be open to abuse. “We may be able to understand the philosophy of such a law. But the list [of companies covered] has to be extremely precise and short.”

&gt; Add to this the fact that investors who fail to notify the Polish authorities of their purchases could face fines of up to 100m zloty, and even jail terms of up to five years, and it is not surprising that Polish business leaders fear the measures could unsettle foreign investors and risk depriving Polish businesses of crucial sources of capital.

&gt; Proponents of the plan argue that such fears are overblown, and that it is similar to measures being taken by Germany to protect its companies from foreign takeovers. But Mr Witucki said this overlooked the huge difference between the capital markets in the two countries. “This kind of law introduced in Germany doesn’t cut German companies off from equity, from capital, because the local capital is extremely strong,” he said. “Poland is much more dependent on foreign investment.”

&gt; The pandemic has delivered such a shock to the global economy that extraordinary temporary measures may be needed to fight it. But they need to be designed in such a way that they do not damage investor confidence. Otherwise the solution risks making the problem worse.",,/r/europe/comments/gjo6hh/polands_plan_to_block_foreign_takeovers_alarms/fqlzuat/,mulgrave2,1589469051

3411,"No, of course it doesn't contradict it, it's a clear downslide. It contradicts the narrative around it though, leading people to believe that the problem is either with Orbán alone or with Fidesz as a party, and an election with an opposition victory would turn it back.

If you're interested in the details read this paragraph, otherwise skip to the last. The second most powerful party is lead by an ex-prime minister who governed the country like it was his fiefdom and treated the people like peasants. The third most powerful party in Hungary used to be openly fascist until just 2-3 years ago. Then comes the party that ruined the economy 15 years ago, then the party of the young liberals who are actually decent, then the one that leans into the narrative that all people on the countryside are either senile old people or nazis, then the actual neo-nazis. The last two are under the parliamentary entry limit.

The focus of Fidesz isn't on attacking the political opposition, they do that to each other well enough. Their focus lies on broadening the power of the government by eroding the checks and balances. They did redraw the voting districts, which were drawn before urbanisation began and heavily marginalised the countryside. Now it heavily marginalises the urban areas. Neither are good. They did turn the news in their favour, but the Hungarian media was never independent. Before they screwed it over it was disproportionately left-leaning, supporting the then ruling government. They turned a broken system into their favour and left it broken. My point is, you can't just 'undo' what Fidesz did and call it a day, all our now problematic systems were broken to start with. Understanding this is key to solving the problem that Hungary presents right now. If we don't get a ruling party that actually fixes these we'll end up with a situation where the shit is going to stop at the border, leading to another Fidesz landslide 4 years later which will release the piles like an avalanche.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/giwzer/poll_72_of_hungarians_approve_of_governments/fqm01rc/,Nerevaryne,1589469155

3443,"Last week, Europe started its liberation from lockdown — and it all feels like a study in national political identity. Belgium took its first step towards ‘deconfinement’ but no one seems exactly sure what that means. France is opting for complexity rather than simplicity. Italy’s national plan for the easing of its lockdown is more convoluted still, but few regions bother to follow it anyway. Spain, goes a national joke, went more slowly and started with a reopening of the siesta. And in Germany, everyone is praising the country’s scientific approach to the pandemic, but as soon as they were allowed to roam freely again, many Germans headed for the beer gardens.

Governments say their approach is ‘guided by the science’. In reality, science doesn’t offer any clear way out of this mess. There is no vaccine around the corner, no answers even to basic questions: how the virus spreads, how many have been infected, why children seem immune. Politics, not science, decides the path out of lockdown. Each country is reopening one step at a time and in its own way, searching for what works in practice, given the lack of certainty. Europe, with all its variety, has become a laboratory experiment in how to end lockdowns.

Here in Sweden, the experiment has involved not doing lockdown at all but instead asking people to socially distance. Gatherings of fewer than 50 are allowed, as are sports events for young people. Church services and dinner parties continue. The distancing has left many of our streets as empty as Britain’s, though, and our economy has suffered. We too have a scandal of too many deaths in care homes. Our guess — and as with everywhere else, it’s not much more than a guess — is that we’re seeing the tail end of it. Our deaths are about average for Europe, albeit higher than the rest of Scandinavia. The virus has spread pretty widely, and we hope it brings immunity in its wake. A study last week suggested herd immunity in Stockholm could be achieved next month, and with an infection rate of 40 per cent.

But Sweden’s experiment has not, it seems, tempted other countries to copy it. Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock are inspired by the testing-intensive German model, and understandably so. Germany has tested about three million people for the virus and its ‘tech approach’ explains how the country has managed to keep its death toll so low. Mass testing is also crucial to Germany’s reopening plan. Bars, restaurants and small shops can now take customers again — provided that staff wear face masks and that people respect social distancing rules. The Bundesliga will restart, but Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and other clubs won’t be playing in crowded stadiums. Later this month, pupils will start going back to schools.

Even Germany’s strategy has at times been held up by Britain as an example of what not to do, however. The UK is judging things by the rate at which the virus spreads: the so-called R number. The aim is to maintain it at below one, so the number of new infections falls. Although ‘the R’ is not published daily in Britain, it is in Germany. And a week after Angela Merkel declared the reopening of the country, it had risen from 0.65 to above 1. This was taken by Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, as proof of what happens to countries that re-open too hastily. But by whose standards?

In Germany there is clear support for phased reopening. Unlike in Britain, German authorities aren’t too alarmed by rises in the R number (which is in any case subject to a lot of assumptions, guesswork and regional variation). Instead, Germans are judging their approach to lockdown by a simpler test: the number of infections. If the number of weekly cases is higher than 50 per 100,000 population in any given area, then the regulations will tighten — but only in that area.

This brings us to an important aspect in the question of ending lockdown: regional differences. We’re all used to seeing virus graphs comparing Britain’s progress with — say — Spain or France. But this disguises a crucial point: there are huge variations within countries. In the past week, Bavaria has averaged 195 new cases a day; Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, however, has recorded only four per day. The north of Italy was horribly affected; the south, hardly at all. A quarter of all Stockholmers have now had the virus, according to official estimates — its Covid rate has been six times that of Malmö. One regional council leader confessed that he had come to the capital to try to catch the virus, to gain immunity.

In the US, Donald Trump has been reduced to the status of an onlooker, cheering on the states that are easing lockdown. There is variety even within those states. In Florida restaurants are open, except in Miami and Palm Beach. And in South Dakota, businesses can reopen in counties that are not hotspots for the virus. Kristi Noem, its governor, says this approach would ‘put the power of decision-making into the hands of the people — where it belongs’.

Even Emmanuel Macron has given up on his earlier idea of France taking a national approach to lockdown. While the reopening of schools is part of a national plan, many parts of France have been given permission to come out of lockdown faster than others. They make up what is called the green zone — the 80 or so départements where the virus isn’t circulating much. Paris and the north-east, however, are a red zone. While Parisians no longer need to fill in a document to leave their houses, they are still restricted. They aren’t able to dine at their local bistros, and nor are the city’s parks and gardens open during this phase.

France wouldn’t be France if the pandemic didn’t inspire new grand attempts to engineer the economy in typical top-down fashion. The French Ministry of Labour has issued a 20-page plan for new safety measures at businesses big and small — adding to the 48 Covid workplace guidelines that were introduced in late April. Thanks to the government, every business owner now knows how to clean their premises and improve workflow management.

Then there is the technological response to the virus: isn’t there an app for that? And if not, can we make one? France, like Britain, has declined offers from Google and Apple to build decentralised tracing apps and instead created its own national app, StopCOVID. The government has promised that it will be ready next month — even though it hasn’t been fully tested yet. The main flaw is rather obvious: if the virus can spread through people who never develop symptoms, how will they be detected by any app? The French Assembly does not look entirely comfortable about approving the app. Just as in Belgium — where the government recently cancelled plans for digital tracing — there are strong concerns in France that the app could preface a power grab. Deputies from both the ruling party — Macron’s La République En Marche! — and the opposition assume that people won’t like having Big Brother in their phone now that they have been freed from their mandatory confinement.

Overall, though, local and decentralised approaches do seem to work better than big national efforts. There are cultural differences to consider as well as the uneven spread of the virus. Bavaria isn’t the same as Berlin, and Bruges isn’t the same as Brussels. Local authorities can move faster than national governments. When power is dispersed rather than concentrated, there is a better chance that successful policies will be found and adopted in other places — and that failures will be spotted.

The reason Germany does so well with testing is, in part, that it doesn’t have a centralised health service: it has 16 strong state governments and, below that, 401 districts, together with a strong private medical sector. Since Berlin isn’t running the country’s healthcare system, hospitals did not have to wait for Merkel or a Reichstag committee to scale up testing. Local authorities could do that on their own and were able to experiment a lot in setting up the facilities for mass testing. And German states that were less quick off the block could catch up by copying what other states were doing.

The idea of a nationally imposed lockdown grates with many of Europe’s regions. A court in the German state of Saarland, for instance, ruled in late April that several of its restrictions were unconstitutional. Last month, there were small demonstrations in several German cities where people were protesting against restrictions on civil liberties; it became increasingly difficult to dismiss such protesters as right-wing trolls, especially as petitions were also filed at other state courts.

Similar rebellions are under way in Italy. This week, for instance, the government in South Tyrol has allowed bars, restaurants and hairdressers to open up again, despite several warnings from Rome that regions shouldn’t allow restaurants to have seated guests before June. In Veneto, people can now sit down outdoors for a drink at a bar and, again against Rome’s instructions, they can travel freely within the region to take care of second homes. Lombardy and several other regions have warned the national government that if restrictions on shops, salons and beaches aren’t lifted next week, they will abolish them anyway.

Everywhere there is political posturing. Many leaders find their opinion poll ratings boosted by the crisis. Some find it difficult to wean themselves off the strongman politics. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán has used the pandemic as an opportunity to grab more power, and he isn’t planning to hand it back. Meanwhile, Denmark’s centre-left Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, has increased her party’s rating by 8 per cent since early March, and she would like to maintain her Iron Lady image. Danes, she seems to think, have enjoyed the firm smack of the government, and want more of it.",,/r/europe/comments/gjoait/league_of_nations_the_race_out_of_lockdown_were/fqm0mnm/,casualphilosopher1,1589469440
3444,"
Local political leaders, too, are enjoying the spotlight. Markus Söder, the state premier of Bavaria, has been labelled ‘Deutschland’s corona hardliner’ — and he is vying for stronger national influence. Set against him is Armin Laschet, the state leader of North Rhine--Westphalia, who is now the frontrunner to take over the national party and succeed Merkel. He has been airing his frustration with national lockdown policies for more than a month. Laschet took a more liberal line than Merkel and couldn’t wait to rid the country of what he considered silly restrictions. In the end, Laschet and other state premiers made it politically impossible for Merkel not to start reopening the country.

Where does all this leave Britain? Staying in lockdown may be a crushingly expensive luxury, but at least it allows the opportunity to learn from other countries about what works and what doesn’t. If the UK wants to recreate Germany’s machinery of testing, it may need to consider how to decentralise things and allow more regional experiments. But overall, the lesson is that any leader seeking to protect their economy and society will, at some point, have to take the plunge. There are no certainties, not enough science, no chance of avoiding risk. But when the time comes to make the break from lockdown, like every other country Britain will be flying in the dark.",,/r/europe/comments/gjoait/league_of_nations_the_race_out_of_lockdown_were/fqm0nae/,casualphilosopher1,1589469448

This statement makes no sense. Isn't the whole point of the lengthy approval process precisely to avoid harmful and ineffective vaccines from existing?

&gt; The real question is which institutions and which scientific studies do you trust. I don't personally trust my government or doctor blindly. 

While the way studies are conducted can change, science isn't a subjective matter - it's pretty exact and objective and part of the lengthily approval process you mentioned. 

While I agree that people should develop critical thinking and never trust anything blindly, it is reasonable to expect vaccine safety studies used by state entities to validate any vaccine to be properly conducted in accordance to the scientific method.

Lowering the requirements by doing it the Canadian way or the way some U.S. states are handling it; merely handing in a document that you want to change your gender identity and name seems like a surefire way to introduce self-diagnosed false positives with other psychological issues (see Jessica Yaniv, who has single-handedly reverted 10 years of trans acceptance progress) but it also causes a lot of legal issues if those persons decide they just wanted to be a woman for a couple months or years.",,/r/europe/comments/gjk48y/poland_ranked_as_worst_country_in_eu_for_lgbt/fqm1z8v/,nastyaxoxo,1589470115

But at this point we just throw arguments at one another. I believe that Russia would supply germany, even with more gas than it needs, because otherwise germany would buy from another supplier and russia would lose its contract. That is something the russians can't afford, because a huge part of revenue would be lost.

And even if we had to pay more for gas to supply other eastern countries, as long as the stability of our neighbors is at risk that would be a valid investment.

3590,"I dont understand why people would push for such a thing, it would render the entire concept of the sexes as nothing more than a personality trait which you can declare on your own.   Its like saying ""Im a black man"" and people having to treat you like one just because you declared it.  Trans people are not actually the sex they wish to transition to, they just use cosmetic surgery, make up, and clothing to imitate the opposite sex.   Somewhere along the way everyone has succumb to social media bullying which crucifies anyone who does not adamently believe that trans people are actually members of their desired sex.  

And activists purposefully use common language to muddy the waters to get what they want.  Right up until recently, being a woman was synonymous with being a female.  Now, activists are trying to get people to think that being a woman simply means you identify as one.  They are trying to push the idea that it means how you dress or identify yourself.  Problem is, its mostly the woke crowd and social science majors from uni that make this hard distinction.  The vast majority of people dont.  I mean, how does a sentence like this make sense ""That woman sure is dressing like a man.""  In this case, suddenly woman refers to biological female instead of how she presents herself.  

Basically, the entire gender theory is built on a house of cards.  Its bad science, if you could even call it that.  It is really simple, some men and women have a mental pathology which requires medical treatment.  The best treatment is for the patient to present as the sex of their choice, and to identify aa such.  Thats it.  It does not suddenly mean that being a man or a woman is a social construct.  It does not mean that a trans woman *is* a woman.  It just means some people have a mental illness and most people are kind enough to treat them like the sex they wish they were.  Trying to redefine the whole concept of what is a man and woman in a strongly sexually dimorphic specied is pure silliness.  I wish some of the social sciences would be reigned in.

Crete had become an independent state in 1898. Before that, there was a brief Egyptian rule supported by British Empire.

Every day my 'woken' (cringe) glasses of the EU gets a bit less foggy. In many ways major parts of the EU are worse than Alabama in the US which is saying a lot like of all the bars to not pass, that's one of them yet we wistfully skip by like its nothing.

The bar, our standards of the EU is extremely depressing but the thing is - it's nothing new. From homophobia to leaders actually kissing the Chinese flag infront of Chinese/European media in the past weeks .. the only good thing about crises like this is the carefully articulated facade pasted on by the government quickly withers away. 

 The fucked up part is that countries like Sweden and Norway that actually stand by our moral compasses have little say in the EU while Germany, Poland, France, etc that seem to have lost their moral compass years ago have almost all the say such as when Merkel and Macron were planning the militaristic and economic future of Europe together.. nobody here was like ""wait, wheres all the other leaders in these talks??"" The reality is no matter what propaganda is fed to us, our little utopia doesn't exist. 

In some ways I think Brexit wasn't the worst thing in the world. I was against it overall and still probably would ultimately vote no if I had a say and went back in time.. but at the same time, UK in some ways can have real say in what it says and does without it being meaningless in the end.

I also make it a point to specifically try as many new restaurants as possible too.
  
Furthermore, Pierogis are a fucking disaster in Poland. They will take something like a potato pierogi (Russian style, as they call it) and BOIL it, then serve it up. Let's just clarify that pierogi is a essentially flour and potato. It's the blandest fucking food you can possibly imagine. If you're lucky you will have skwarki, or fried onions and bacon, but I'm fucking sorry, you put fried bacon and onions on anything and it will taste amazing, that doesn't mean the unseasoned, pierogi base is good. 
  
To take it a step further, I decided to use pierogi as a carb base, like rice, and I began frying up my own mixtures using green onions, roasted red peppers, hot sauce, herbs and seasonings, etc. When I showed it to my Polish friends they were appalled by what I had done, like I had just fucked their mother on their grandmother's grave stone. But, bar none, every single friend that has tried my version told me that it was good if not superior. 
  
Bigos I would actually say is horrible cuisine, it's one of the worst things I've ever eaten in my life. Sour cabbage with chunks of white sausage? Fucking hurl dude, I'm sorry. It's the experience of bland sausage with all the fun of sour flavor, along with the wet slurpy cabbage. 
  
Luckily, in cities like Warsaw, a new breed of young restauranteurs is forming amazing quality cuisine based on global influences. Places like La Sirena, Pacyfik, or Krowarzywa take the concept of a hole in the wall restaurant, and manage to turn it into something that tantalizes your flavor profile, while offering creative new options.

&gt; wearing tracksuits with addidas/puma/etc logos (and fake ones more often than not) and tacky sunglasses as casual street wear

&gt; the ""I know a guy"" or ""I have a friend who knows a guy"" attitude towards public service because of corruption

&gt; maybe on weekends you go to the same spot just outside your town, get a BBQ grill made from 4 rusty pieces of steel, wood chopped off from the remaining 20-30 trees there and dump your trash where everyone else is dumping their trash and pray someone else cleans it

&gt; women caring a lot about looking pretty in the most awkward of circumstances - whether they put on some Victoria's Secret underwear for the aforementioned BBQ, or they'll put on make-up and get their nails done every day before going to shit in a hole in the ground in the backyard because the mayor stole the funds and the nearest bathroom is in the town 20km away

&gt; take loans to buy used cars from Germany and bust your regional turbofolk variant to boast some wealthy lifestyle

&gt; have the ability to extract all the necessary nutrients off cheap beer and sunflower seeds while doing photosynthesis off the TV screen showing 3rd league football games

&gt; make moonshine out of [chicken shit](http://www.ciprianhomorodean.eu/rachiu-din-cacat-si-pufoaica/) if your plums aren't good enough, or just find your local ""bar"" where all the old people drink to forget their sorrows

&gt; kiss the ass of your local orthodox priest for Christmas and Easter and then forget about the church for the rest of the year

&gt; on that note, follow superstitions religiously every time some significant event happens ""just in case"", because sure as shit you'll be damned if you forget to open the windows, cover all the mirrors, etc. at someone's funeral.

What the article fails to explain, is why NS2 would allow Russia to dictate energy supply to the Ukraine.

In all these discussions on /r/europe people always aknowledged that Russia never failed to deliver Gas to Germany, even during the heights of the cold war. So we can expect Russia to continue delivering, even in a hot situation with its neighbours.

All these articles fail to explain why the Ukraine, Belarus or any other country would not be able to get their Gas through Germany, which can redirect it further east through the existing Pipelines.

Germany seeks energy security, which was not a given when the Ukraine [stole Gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93Ukraine_gas_disputes) from the Pipelines leading through their country. It also seeks cheap energy, which can only be achieved if the suppliers need to adjust their prices to one another.

I also expect Germany to not stop delivering Gas to neighboring countries, as we don't have an interest in destabilising them to save our Prosperity.

In Ireland, Malta and Finland, more than 70 percent of respondents said society has become more tolerant in the past five years. However in Poland and France, most respondents said that intolerance has increased overall (68 percent and 54 percent, respectively).

3922," Another liar. It seems that some things never change.

**On April 17, 1991, Ambassador Nelson Ledsky testified before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee that ""most of the 'missing persons' disappeared in the first days of July 1974, before the Turkish intervention on the 20th. Many killed on the Greek side were killed by Greek Cypriots in fighting between supporters of Makarios and Sampson.""** 

**On Nov. 6, 1974, Ta Nea reported that dates from the graves of Greek Cypriots killed in the five days between July 15-20 were erased in order to blame these deaths on the subsequent Turkish military action.**

**On March 3, 1996, the Greek Cypriot Cyprus Mail wrote: ""(Greek)**

**Cypriot governments have found it convenient to conceal the scale of atrocities during the July 15 coup in an attempt to downplay its contribution to the tragedy of the summer of 1974 and instead blame the Turkish invasion for all casualties. There can be no justification for any government that failed to investigate this sensitive humanitarian issue. The shocking admission by the Clerides government that there are people buried in Nicosia cemetery who are still included in the list of the 'missing' is the last episode of a human drama which has been turned into a propaganda tool.""**

**On Oct. 19 1996, Mr. Georgios Lanitis wrote: ""I was serving with the Foreign Information Service of the Republic of Cyprus in London.... I deeply apologize to all those I told that there are 1,619 missing persons. I misled them. I was made a liar, deliberately, by the government of Cyprus. ...today it seems that the credibility of Cyprus is nil.""**

And This is why the Turks continue to live there.

Lol, what attachment?

&gt;That's how simple it is.

Well as is evident, it's not even how it is...

&gt;Estonians decided to side with them and that's unjustifiable.

*Many Estonians

And it was entirely justifiable, considering what had happened to us before. It is just sheer arrogance to think that people should not have rejoiced if they saw the horrible Soviet occupation come to an end or that people should have not fought against the returning of Soviet occupation.

&gt;Again, commemorating nazi volunteers is not a good thing.

Commemorating their fight against the re-invading Soviets is.

&gt;You need to teach that in Estonia cause they currently have a disproportionally high amount of nazis in their country.

What a ridiculous accusation.

&gt;What does ""your claimed motives"" mean? They hated russians.

They hated the Soviets.

&gt;Cool(but not so much).

More like rational.

&gt;Then why did they also hunted jews?

Again, wtf?

You think these commemoration events are about them??

But yes, most of us are tired of the constant noise that Hungary is making regarding Transylvania. 

Trianon simply means the international recognition of the unification, which happened democratically. Even the saxons living in Transylvania voted in favor, because they were tired of the way they were treated. And yes, even if you accept or not, Hungary did not exactly treat the non-hungarians in Transylvania right. Especially the romanian population lacked a lot of rights, etc. And let's face it, according to hungarian censuses, the romanian population was constantly a majority there. Hungary occupied Transylvania, a long time ago.

This is a result of a hungarian census: http://imgur.com/gallery/GfDvWxq

Greek government fears that Turkish-Libyan maritime deal will be implemented if the UN recognised government retakes whole Libya. The Turkish army has changed the balance in Libya, basically saved the UN recognised government and retaken some strategic areas and now are pushing towards inland Libya. French government interest in Libya is about the oil in east and west Libya, these oil fields are important for French companies like Total, Eni and Exon. French fear after the UN recognised government retakes these regions it will exclude these companies from operating in these areas because of the French's support for Haftar. Egyptian governments fears the growing influence of the Turkish government in Northern Africa. It's not a secret that AKP the ruling party in Turkey supports the Muslim brotherhood. UAE has tried to bribe Assad to break the ceasefire and attack Idlib, by doing that to drain the Turkish army to become inefficient in Libya. This small gulf state basically finances the mercenary army of Haftar, uses the club plane of Manchester City to fly Sudanese mercenaries towards Libya. The Emiratis has bought billions of dollars worth military hardware from the Americans, French and Israelis, Chinese and Russians who are used against the UN recognised government. We are speaking about high tech weaponry like Russian pantsir anti aircraft missiles and Chinese drones. Americans recently sold millions of dollars worth of armed vehicles to the UAE that will be deployed soon in the ranks of Haftar's army against the UN recognised government. Let's not forget that French fighter jets like the Mirage series are used to bomb Tripoli. Most weapons are in facts brought from Egypt to Libya not from the Mediterranean sea. Whatever you guys think and say about Turkey. Turkey did the right move to save the UN recognised government that is also internationally recognised government, when EU brokered a refugee deal with North African countries it was with the Tripoli UN based government.

That you say you have no connection to anatolian greeks but we had 1.5 million people exchanged after these event with the request of your state for some reason that isn't racism but okay. It shouldn't be considered something important just because you don't have any connection with them.

\&gt;  The entire Armenian world was a victim of the genocide the vast majority of Armenians have a personal connection to it, they were almost completely exterminated as a race, so obviously it plays a far greater deal in their nation and identity, it was a cataclysmic extinction event for them.

Armenian population was estimated around 1.2 (minimum claim) -2.4m (maximum claim)  people and the genocide claims in between 700k (minimum claim) up to millions (i don't know the max. claim on this)  and then you go ahead check the Armenian population of the First Armenian Republic ""inside modern day Armenia"". Now it doesn't make anything better or the crime to be less brutal at all but they didn't face extinction.

I'm objective enough to say all of this. What about the crimes against us? I've never seen anyone discuss what happened to european turkey in here.

Please show me examples of Anatolian Greeks ever causing any problems for the Ottoman Empire. For the most part they were okay with Ottoman rule and they even welcomed the young turk revolution. Many saw the Ottoman Empire even as preferable to Greece for economic reasons especially the merchant/business class. The Greeks of the Asian Minor were like the Bourgeoisie of the Greek world. They were the type of people who went to schools, and ran companies and industries, commercial activities. Not the type to pick up arms, start revolts, or anything. So even by your stupid logic that doesn't make any sense, they were targeted simply due to racism and butthurt over the stomping the Ottomans received in the Balkan wars events at the end of the day they had no connection to aside from sharing the ethnicity of Greeks in Greece at the time.

That's exactly what I'm telling you. On the one hand we have ethnic conflicts with casualties on both sides (1964) and on the other we have massive extermination of minorities (1914-1923).

&gt;It is genocide because those Turks who were killed were unarmed civilians and were killed by brutal bad people.

&gt;Those you mentioned were the deat 174 Greek-Cypriots soldiers who killed those people. This is the difference.

This is not the definition of a genocide. If it is, then you confirm that the death of the 174 Greek-Cypriots was also a genocide because they were also unarmed civilians (saying that they were soldiers shows the levels of propaganda you've been exposed to) killed by brutal bad people.

Read what you post. Nobody denies that EOKA B was a fascist organization that committed crimes against both greeks and turks. Cyprus officially considers EOKA B a terrorist organization. Still, a genocide is a very different thing. Meanwhile TMT, the Turkish equivalent of EOKA B who butchered the greek civilians, are considered national heroes...

4053,"The tourism industry is currently being affected by the Covid-19 outbreak, due to travel restrictions that have been implemented in response to the pandemic. To gauge the potential loss that the tourism sector will have experienced because of these restrictions, we can examine tourism figures of the previous two years for the periods of March-June (the ‘spring shoulder season’) and July-August (the ‘peak summer season’). For the purpose of this analysis, the ‘peak summer’ season does not comprise June, but focuses on the two months (July and August) overlapping with the main holiday season in most Member States.

Spring and summer are the most popular seasons for Europe’s tourism industry. In 2019, the number of nights spent by residents and non-residents in EU tourist accommodation establishments during the spring and the peak summer season each accounted for nearly one-third (32%) of the annual total for overnight stays.

The share of nights spent in these accommodation establishments was particularly high in the month of June for the spring season, accounting for 11% of the annual total, as well as in the months of July (15%) and August (17%). A similar trend is observed for both residents and non-residents of the countries visited.

Across the EU Member States, the share that the spring season contributes towards annual tourism accommodation stays is relatively similar, ranging from 24% in Croatia and 27% in Bulgaria to 35% in Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands. For the peak summer season, this share ranged from 23% in Malta to 58% in Croatia.

&amp;#x200B;

**390 million trips in spring, 270 million trips during peak summer season**

In spring 2018, EU residents made almost 390 million tourist trips, representing 34% of the annual total. During these trips, they cumulated over 1.8 billion overnight stays and spent €170 billion.

More than two-thirds (70%) of these trips were inside the country of residence, while 22% of them were trips to other EU countries and 8% to destinations outside the EU. A similar pattern was observed for trips throughout the entire year, including during the peak summer season.

In summer 2018, over 270 million trips were made by EU residents, accounting for 24% of the annual total. These trips amounted to over 1.9 billion overnight stays and almost €138 billion in tourism spending.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spain and Italy top destinations for intra-EU visitors**

The EU residents’ preferred European destinations outside their own country were: Spain, Italy and to a lesser extent France and Germany, which together accounted for 49% of intra-EU trips during spring 2018 and 45% in summer.

From March to June, Austria dominated the top-5 of preferred intra-EU destinations, in July and August Croatia was among the most popular destinations for EU tourists.

Your muscles will figured it out in the first month. 

The technical universities are tough here at the master level, you have to be prepared for that ! For any technical master I recommend that you should re use the basic maths apriori entering the study cycle. You can email some professors or the education coordinator of the master to ask what kind of maths are good to be known.

The study cycles are in quartiles: 3-4 modules for 8 weeks of study, then 2 weeks for exams, rinse and repeat 4 times a year. To be onest i don't recommend having more that 3 modules per quartile. each module has 5 ECTS credits and 1 credit is equal to 28 hours of study, so you should expect that for 15 credits you will study at least, and I emphasise on at least, 420 hours in those 8 weeks.

You're right that it's not a right way, but this day is a thing too proud of our history (and, probably V-day celebration have a big role in live of country because we don't have other reasons to proud in our modern history).

USSR was a country with strong dictatorship, that's true. But people were very good, this dictatorship didn't mark them (maybe only a part who worked in special services).

Not true. Israel offered a return to the 1948 ceasefire lines (again, the ones the Arab League has repeatedly refused) and that would become a hard border for Israel and Syria. The sticking point was Israel wanted Syria to stop arming and funding Hezbollah and Syria refused.

Basically, Syria wanted to keep fighting Israel indirectly through an armed group that has launched hundreds of attacks on Israeli civilians. That isn't peace.

&gt; Egypt and Jordan already recognized Israel without resolving the Palestinian issue, so there is no need for Israel to give up land to achieve recognition. 

Israel gave up land to both Egypt and Jordan for a peace treaty, which included recognition. The PLO later took a similar deal, through Oslo.

4121,"I get your point, and it's true, I know that soviet people truly believed they were fighting for their land, and of course it's good for you to celebrate their efforts to win the war against fascim. It's undeniable that soviet union had a key role in defeating nazism. As a russian you are right to remember your dead. Just dont blame other people in other coutries that completely disagree with this way of thinking.

To be more specific, soviet union had a crucial role in defeating nazism materially, physically. Not morally. And this is my point.

In soviet union and some post soviet countries like russia, victory day isn't celebrate by only remembering common people dead to win a war (this is acceptable everywhere in the world). It's celebrated with military parades emphashizing nationalism and military power. And in particular, celebrating soviet military power, a dictatorship military power! Soviet nostalgia everywhere! For me, this is like admitting: ""we've understood nothing"".

Celebrating nationalism for a victory against a totalitarian ideology based on nationalism?!? Completely hypocrite. But this is the spirit with which soviets completely disappointed people living in the territories they occupied: instead of giving them freedom, instead of helping them to get back on their feet, they created an emotial nationalistic rhetoric that was completely false. Nice way to not liberate at all your people /s

I think this is the reason russians cannot understand why eastern europe that have been under soviet occupation prefer to consider americans as liberators, despite both america and russia won the war. There is way less nationalism in european way of celebrating victory day, it's more about remembering a tragedy, it's more about remembering the reasons behind the war, the mistakes that led to ww2, what we did wrong. It all starting here, in europe, not in russia. Communism, ww1, nationalism, fascism, nazism, ww2. Europe has a really good reason to be thoughtful instead of flexing muscles like russia does.  It's impossible to celebrate the end of a massacre in the way soviets did (and russians are doing it), even if it was a victory against an horrible ideology, also couse everybody knows that it was immediatly replaced by another terrible dictatorship.",,/r/europe/comments/gfjiv7/75_years_ago_the_victory_in_europe_day_happened/fqk3xm1/,Proudofhisname,1589419756

4124,"&gt; I don't think so. The famine basically killed the Irish language as the main language here. A lot of Ireland's economic success before the last recession came from having an English speaking work force and a low corporation tax, English would I guess probably have taken over as the spoken laguage but probably not to the same extent and 
corporation tax wouldn't have been possible I think if we were still in the UK.

I disagree to an extent. Look at France for example; many of its citizens spoke regional languages at the start of the 20th century before primary education gained emphasis and was standardized. While I agree that the famine decimated the language, it would have likely slowly lost strength over time due to having class in English only, as well as courts in English. So the Ireland would definitely have the benefit of being an English speaking area. 

Also, if there was more equitable treatment towards the Irish, then I would believe that Ireland would have also received better investments from the crown for infrastructure, education, and commerce.

4161,"I didn't say everything stopped but things like plumbing and organisation weren't the same. Europe never had a city as populated as Rome in its height until London in Victorian times I believe and the next city to even come close to plumbing was Tenochtitlán. I do agree that the ""dark ages"" are exaggerated but the fact that the renaissance improved so much in terms of education, arts and even quality of life just by renewing interest in the Greco-Roman approach to society shows how advanced they were for their time. Of course that also depends on how much you value interest and active pursuit of sciences, arts and philosophy as a mark of being a great civilisation.

Not to mention the quality of life from things like Pax Romana. While it wasn't a permanent fixture managing to secure a good couple hundred years without major warfare within the borders is probably the longest anyone in Europe or the mediterranean went without major conflict ever. Our peace since 1945 is Europe's longest in 600 years or so.

Political engagement (even if very dominated by upper aristocracy) was higher for any random citizen in Rome than anyone else until the Enlightenment era revolution (short of things like the Dithmarschen peasants). Social mobility, especially during the empire, and the chance for plebs to be raised to ministries or even Imperium is very hard to imagine in the ages of feudalism and absolutism that followed. And for most of the history of the western roman empire they were pretty good at religious toleration (until they met universalist monotheists who didn't want to engage in a syncretic pantheon and then that all ended).

So I still maintain that Rome was more advanced than most states that lived in the Europe and North Africa for a good long time after.

I don’t think it will change any time soon to be realistic nor any Turkish politician  will apologize randomly over this incident. It’s also not just Armenians but the Greeks aswell. We don’t see that Greeks crying over genocide because they actually accomplished something. Let’s get back to the Turkish perspective which noone has to care. Turkey would only recognize the genocide on government level when all the other modern day governments of former ottoman empire get to gather and say that we all systematically killed each other because of their nationality or religious beliefs. We all share the guilt equally. Because that’s what it really is. Vast manority of ethnic Turks lived in balkans for centuries. More so than Russians in Crimea. Where is Crimea Khanate today? Extinct.. Millions of Turkish civilians were killed and driven out of Balkans after the French Revolution. These people were no threat to anybody and had all the right to live in their communities. By communities i mean as big as cities. The Ottoman expansion has stopped 300 years ago before it’s collapse. The state just tried maintain good relations and forge alliances especially with France.
Sure it wasn’t modern day Canada but it was still okay. Definitely not evil force to kill and drive out it’s citizens. Anyways this Sickman of Europe failed to protect it’s citizens and turks were killed and robbed out of their land left and right. Ethics aside it wasn’t even good riddance because no Turkish state trough out history ever acted this way. Please kindly check the demographics of all the Turkish states.

Edit because someone claimed 28% as a sensible number and because I already wrote my answer:

According to Fauci:

&gt;We really can’t depend on herd immunity until we get either enough people infected, or enough people vaccinated,” he said during the Thursday interview. That means either a vaccine is developed and the vast majority of people become immune to the virus, or **70-80% of people contract the virus through community spread** and develop antibody protection, indirectly protecting the rest of the population that is not yet immune to the virus.

https://time.com/5825386/herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19/

Or this here:

&gt;The modeling study from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota also says that about 70% of people need to be immune in order to bring the virus to a halt.

4228,"&gt;  treaties clearly made the ECJ the ultimate authority and gave it the ultimate power in interpretation.

Alright, let me just check the ruling from 1993 on the treaty of Maastricht...  

&gt; **The Federal Constitutional Court guarantees through its jurisdiction** (see BVerfGE 37, 271 &lt;280 ff.&gt;; 73, 339 &lt;376 f.&gt;) that effective protection of the fundamental rights of the inhabitants of Germany **is generally assured, also in respect to the sovereign power of the Communities**, and that such protection of fundamental rights is to be considered equal to that which is mandated by the Basic Law, especially since the substance of such fundamental rights is generally guaranteed. In this way **the Federal Constitutional Court secures the substance of fundamental rights, even in respect of the sovereign power of the Community** (see BVerfgGE 73, 339 &lt;386&gt;). Acts of the particular public power of a supranational organisation which is separate from the State power of the Member States may also affect those persons protected by fundamental rights in Germany. Such acts therefore affect the guarantees provided under the Basic Law and **the duties of the Federal Constitutional Court, which include the protection of fundamental rights in Germany, and not only in respect of German governmental institutions** (notwithstanding BVerfGE 58, 1 &lt;27&gt;).  

The ruling on the 2009 treaty of Lisbon is even more harsh.  
You're just wrong, that's not what the treaty does.  

&gt; Germany can't unilaterally change the treaties, no matter what the German court says.

These things haven't been put this way without a reason. So how can it be ok that your government simply signs a treaty and undermines the safeguards?

What I'm more willing to accept is if you say: ""Your constitution doesn't allow you to fulfill the EU treaty, but then you shouldn't have signed the treaty in the first place and will now be forcefully removed from it"". That seems fine.

Yes, the supreme constitutional courts ruled on the treaties when they were introduced and on every amendment. Who else would decide whether the treaty being signed by german parliament is compatible with the german constitution?  

&gt; Then why do we have this thing called the ECJ?  

ECJ rules on EU law.  
The treaties are not EU law, they are the basis that legitimizes the EU institutions and EU law.  
ECJ cannot rule on the treaty that gives it power in the first place.

&gt; Your constitutional court has opened up Pandora's box.  

This has been the legal situation for over 25 years in Germany, and several other countries have ruled against the ECJ before. The world did not end then and it won't now.

&gt; I'd argue that the ones acting ultra vires are them under the sophism that it's only their share in the ECB what they're ruling about.

You would be wrong. The german supreme court is the authority on the german constitution legitimized in the constitution.

They didn't.

From a practical point, while Hungarians still make up some 1,2 million people of Romania, this event can be exclusively rejoiced by the Romanian population of Romania. Moreover despite it being a tragic event for Hungarians they are forced to anticipate the celebrations and are expected to cheer for it.

&gt;	The goal of interwar Hungary was to regain all of the ""historical Hungarian lands"" anyway, and they attempted to do so

I don't think this is in its entirety true.

As of today in 2020, borders doesn't really matter any more. Not a right-wing politician wants to 'regain lands' or to 'secede from Slovakia'.

You're just showing your own ignorance. The Arab League has adopted the ""Land for Peace"" proposal, which is exactly the Green Line territories, it is Israel who refuses to withdraw from Golan, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. 

&gt; Israel offered to return all the land it had occupied in exchange for peace. The Arab League unanimously refused to even discuss it. Israel offered to go back to the 1948 ceasefire lines that the Arab League had refused in 1948, and was then refusing in 1967 even though Israel was offering all of its war gains.

You're lying *again*. In no way was the Khartoum Resolution a response to Israeli attempts to a peace. It was a response to Israel occupying large swaths of their countries, yknow the famous Six Day War? You seem under the impression that the Arab pre-emptive denial of peace with Israel somehow shows that Israel ever had the intention of yknow, giving back the territories. Which is just objectively wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

The EU is destined to fail. There is 0 chance to recover.

The EU's most important foundation is freedom. That's why it became so popular, because everyone like to do anything they wanted. That's what freedom means, to be able to do anything. Now there are few countries which are doing what they want (Poland, Hungary), but what they do paints a very bad image from them in the eyes of those who are still doing things the liberal way.

But the EU can't do anything about it, if they keep funding these countries people will say the EU is shit, they are funding undemocratic values. If they stop funding these countries, people will say that EU is not that free afterall, you can't do anything you want, you have to obey. The EU worked so far because noone felt that we are obeying, thus we felt free.

At this point, any action done by the EU regarding this issue, will backfire, and eventually the EU will fall. Their only chance is not to do anything about it, because that way at least they keep the freedom, and hope these countries will reconvert. However, it takes 1-2 more countries to get on the Polish/Hungarian way, and it's over.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/gj1uth/the_eu_is_undermining_its_democracies_while/fqikhag/,iatesquidonce,1589397200

https://www.irishtimes.com/news/role-of-turkey-during-famine-clarified-1.672383




A COPY of a letter on display at the European Commission office in Dawson Street, Dublin, brings increased clarity to an ongoing debate over the generous role of the Turkish people towards Ireland during the Famine.

The letter, signed by the Anglo-Irish gentry of the time, expresses gratitude to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire for a donation of £1,000 which was sent to the people of Ireland in 1847, when the Famine was at its peak.

According to the Turkish ambassador to Ireland, Altay Cenziger, the correspondence confirms that the people of Turkey did come to the rescue of the Irish during this country’s darkest hour.

“This is proof that the people of Turkey assisted the Irish during the Famine. The money sent to Ireland was sufficient to send 250 people to America,” he said.

The issue of Turkey’s role in assisting Ireland was the subject of a diplomatic difference of opinion last March when President Mary McAleese addressed guests at a State dinner in Ankara.

Mrs McAleese said the town of Drogheda adopted the star and crescent symbol as its emblem in gratitude to the people of Turkey who, she indicated, sent three ships full of food to the Co Louth port during the Famine.

The remarks were dismissed by the Drogheda Historical Society which said there was no record of any ships arriving in the town at that time with cargo from Turkey.

The President’s remarks sparked a debate on whether or not Turkish aid came to Ireland or just Drogheda. Mr Cezinger told The Irish Timesthat research is ongoing to establish further evidence of the role played by the Turkish people at the time.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/giyzt3/population_change_of_counties_in_ireland_from/fqim7vq/,nunchukity,1589397868

countries without 5G having corona doesnt preclude the possibility of 5G causing the disease. for one, it could be that 5G is (a) cause (among others) and that countries without 5G got infected via other, more traditional vectors.

But your ""argument"" shows the problem with conspiracy theorists. Internet theorizing cannot and must not replace actual science, because actual science is complicated and subtle.

The correct way to refute the 5G-causes-corona claim would be to point to the [germ theory of disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease), a well tested scientific theory that has mountains of evidence in support of it and is being named as the mechanism of action by disease research experts in peer-reviewed literature, as being orders of magnitudes more likely to correctly explain the corona disease than a theory sorely lacking in credible evidence that's being propagated by laymen on the internet",,/r/europe/comments/giynl9/false_claim_video_shows_protests_erupting_in/fqi4cui/,pinkp0weranger,1589389872

4536,"**Surprise! I am neither white, male, churchgoing, or politically conservative!**

I also have a visible disability, and was raised in an extremely poor household for a good portion of my life. I don't check the typical boxes you're assuming I do.

I am not as black &amp; white in my opinion of conservatives in the US due to the fact that I understand where my parents and others I grew up with feel. My father worked his ass off for his entire life, and eventually it paid off. He created his own business and has experienced a lot of success. After sharing frozen dinners among 5 people for most of our lives, he was so proud he could provide for his family the life he always imagined for us. I don't look down on him because he believes he should keep the majority of money he earns. I understand his mindset.

I now live in one of the most liberal states in the US. I'm sorry for the negativity you received, I've been called racist slurs in my own state, as well as other dominately liberal areas of the US. I don't excuse the far-right radicals that exist in our area, (but also in likely all 50 states), but it's a product of how they were raised. It's typically more generational. As is the case for all countries- we all have different experiences. The 1950s were different than the 80s, and the 2000s, and now. Political parties have looked fairly different throughout US history, as is the case for all countries' political groups.

Thank you for taking the time to find studies from fairly credible sources, but studies on social problems and issues  like we're mentioning aren't smoking guns. 328 million people aren't included in these studies, bc it's impossible obviously, but also bc the amount of variables not taken into account are staggering, as well as the unlikelihood of a fairly representative sample of a population taken.

I'm not a Trump supporter. I'm not a Republican. I'm not a Democrat. My parents, who are conservatives, didn't vote for Trump. They didn't like either candidate. My parents believe in gay rights, they don't go to church still, but they were raised fairly strict Methodists and still have semblances of beliefs from that experience. I don't believe in a two party system. I don't agree with the US electoral process. I believe we have enormous problems in the US. I'm not in the minority with all of these statements listed above.

I admire your passion for this discussion. I only ask of you to consider that just because one might say they're part of a political party, esp. in a system where only 2 have any pull in politics, not to assume they're soulless uninformed racist idiots. Just like someone who says they're a Christian or a believer in Islam doesn't mean they're wearing white robes and carrying torches at rallies or preaching sharia law.

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ""Linux"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called ""Linux"" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.",,/r/europe/comments/giynl9/false_claim_video_shows_protests_erupting_in/fqi5o2g/,Zennofska,1589390613

Homeless rates aren't a particularly useful measure of poverty rates. Someone can be ""Staying temporarily with friends or family because"" they have nowhere else to go and meet that definition. It's less than 1% of the population.

Actual poverty rates:

Estonian SS actively participated in the German program of massacring what they considered ""undesirable races"". They fought for the victory of Nazism, and therefore calling them ""Nazis"" is fully justified. Nor were they all hapless conscripts, as is frequently asserted by Baltic revisionists. One may recall the [3rd Estonian SS Volunteer Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3rd_Estonian_SS_Volunteer_Brigade), who joined the Nazi cause of their own free will, and were employed to terrorize the civilians in areas where the Soviet partisan movement was active.

The criminal nature of SS is recognized across Europe. Baltic countries are alone in allowing the marches of SS veterans, and even having the officials (such as the president of Estonia Laar) send them greetings.

&gt;&gt;    Estonian and Latvian SS division WAS NAZIS.

Nobody is pretending that they care about absolute freedom of speech, though - you are pulling this out of nowhere to poison the waters with claims that liberal westerners have no real morals, only an agenda to attack their political opponents. Doing so allows you to handwave any criticism against authoritarian governments, because everyone that says a dictatorship is a bad thing is a *hypocrite* (and probably a gay one at that), and we need to avoid them lest they import some muslims on us!

That you refuse to address this specific policy and are talking only in general terms about freedom of speech says much about how much faith you have in your position to actually stand up in an argument.

No, I think the legislation is excessive (and the decision was wrong frankly, more on that obviously..).

The story above is the police using one bit of legislation, and then applying a different standard again (making it about criticism of the government rather than the intended issue..).

It is still making it look like they were somehow pro-Nazi.

You can probably add that people breaking the law online in this manner, using an easily traceable platform, where the evidence of an offence is preserved and it can be reported to the police simply makes it far easier for the police to take action compared to someone say, standing outside your house and shouting abuse.

Don't get me wrong, there are things I think should be changed, but broadly the UK has struck a relatively decent balance (with some outliers..). And generally offences offline track online offences pretty closely (see https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/summary-what-offences-may-be-committed-if-someone-shouted-or-approached-another-person and compare it to posts online.). And of course action for online comments is, compared to all other action taken for harassment etc.. and public order offences, pretty low (despite it leaving more in the way of evidence....).",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/gitcvm/he_criticized_the_hungarian_government_on/fqgypao/,-ah,1589361772

QTR is made of three months... so 6% in one month makes up 33% of that QTR change (in a perfect world where every month is equal).

What you are doing is...

(5.8) + .1  + (.2) = (6%)

Now you might think yes!!! that is right they shrunk by (6%). That is incorrect a QTR is the combined revenue of the three months so the math is to combine three months into one figure and then compare it with the same period last QTR or 12 months ago depending on what is being shown (Qtr on Qtr or Annual change)...

I hope that make sense...  We all make silly mistakes I used to argue with my brother that £1 was worth more than 2x50p... (to be fair i was 6) but they never let me forget it.

Now if you were talking Monthly change yes March 2019 compared to March 2020 has dropped a Massive 5.8%... but were talking QTR and that is the total revenue for that period. The reason they do this is because it even out any changes in a particular month and provides a more stable picture.. in this case it is actually hiding how bad it is as your adding 2 good months into one terrible month = a poor month...

For radioactivity to harm, you need the matter to reach its victim; while CO2 damage the one and only climate we have. No need for a leak, an earthquake or an accident, just normal chemistry: a gram of waste might harm someone someday, while every gram of CO2 in the air do harm the climate.     
Low probability of a local risk VS certainty of a global one.     

Were will your plant be in a million year? is Carbon not Carbon anymore? Would you say that wood is prone to burning or decomposition (at best release of carbon in the form of methane). not exaclty the best ""waste disposal"" for carbon.    

Would you qualify the consequence of global warming as ""below detectable level""? How would you compare them to, say, a +3-4% of increase of cancer risk?    
Because those are what the WHO say about the consequence of  [Chernobyl](https://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/chernobyl/backgrounder/en/) (""there may be up to 4 000 additional cancer deaths among the three highest exposed groups over their lifetime (240 000 liquidators; 116 000 evacuees and the 270 000 residents of the SCZs). Since more than 120 000 people in these three groups may eventually die of cancer, the additional cancer deaths from radiation exposure correspond to **3-4% above the normal incidence of cancers** from all causes.)  or [Fukushima](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/78218/1/9789241505130_eng.pdf) (""The present results suggest that the increases in the incidence of human disease attributable to the additional radiation exposure from the Fukushima Daiichi NPP accident are likely to remain **below detectable levels**"" [or](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/94/11/15-168187/en/)).

That's a dangerous mentality. You don't care about them but we do. If you were a much smaller country and your neighbor was openly preaching that your land belongs to them you'd be worrying too. The ""it's for internal consumption"" argument only works until it doesn't. Who's to say that a party won't stage an event like with Imia for internal consumption and votes? 

&gt; Those claims wont become a real deal so dont bother with stuff like this. 

Again, that's a convenient approach. Since there are more important problems to address, maybe the solution would be that your parties don't make such claims, instead of us ignoring them when they're made.

I am not convinced that the PA is more autonomous than a set of Quizlings colaborating with the occupying power. They rely on Israel to collect taxes for them, generate power for them, their militarized police closely cooperates with the Israeli army. They lost an election to a coalition led by Hamas back in 2006 and rather than hand over power they started a little civil war.

5122,"This story made headlines a couple of days ago in Malta after our local ""BuzzFeed"" picked it up by characteristically reporting only one side of the story, partly similar to this one. Here's what also happened after they contacted the driver after he commented on the article criticising the author for only publishing half of the story:

&gt;The driver claims that tensions rose after dropping the client off at his residence in Sliema. 
The driver informed him about the new regulation for mandatory masks in all public transport including taxis to which the client said the guidelines only applied for buses.

&gt;He also said that the passenger didn’t have children with him.

&gt;When the driver drove to his residence in Sliema, the client allegedly slammed the door and flipped him off. He denies all allegations of attacking him.
Following the incident, the driver immediately reported the Japanese man for being disrespectful.
Bolt has also released a statement following the accusations.

&gt;“The driver involved in the incident has been a Bolt partner for a long time with  a very positive customer feedback record and satisfaction  rating,” they said.

In your post you describe a situation where the person knows their actions may cause death, but if it didn't, you can't charge him for that death.

If we imagine a situation where a reckless driver deliberately swerved to hit a pedestrian (thus consituting attempted murder or thereabouts), but it turns out that pedestrian was already dead, why should he be charged for their death?  Not a perfect example but I hope it gets my point across

You have to prove without a reasonable doubt that:
- He actually carried coronavirus at the time and that he knew he had it (rather than just claiming in anger that he did)
- The act of him spitting on her is what caused her to contract COVID-19, rather than one of the hundreds of other interactions she as a station worker would have had with other people. i.e. what if she already had COVID by the time he spit on her but symptoms had not yet surfaced?

Mostly researchers changing primary endpoint, not having an overall p value&lt;5, bad randomization or other small mistake especially made to hide the failure in the design of the study.


I have to admit there is also gatekeeping from publishers, because obviously they don't want to risk publishing fake or badly written articles, and have a bias towards interesting studies rather than useful ones (it's more interesting to publish a research saying something is true than something is untrue, while both are useful).


But the thing is, if a research is actually false, it will be evident because other researchers are going to replicate the study. If a result is found only by very few studies financed by shady corporations (yes you can see who is funding in the article, also who's quoted), chances are there's a confict of interest. The biggest example is tobacco financed research in the 20th century, denying cancer correlation.

In this situation, the station worker may have already had COVID-19 but symptoms had not yet surfaced.  In this situation, spitting on her would have made no difference to her getting COVID since she already had it.  Her death was already in motion, and his actions made no difference.

For example, let's imagine a situation set in the 1980s when HIV was a death sentence.  If the woman unknowingly contraced HIV from someone else through consensual action, and then this man came, said he had HIV, threated to give it to her and then raped her.

Genocide means deliberately destroying a category of people defined by its racial religious, national or other identity. Napoleon never attempted such a thing.  
By the way, all wars waged by Napoleon were defensive ones except for the Peninsular War (the 1812 invasion of russia resulted from the breaking of the 1807 peace terms by Russia.)  
Napoleon and the french revolutionists were far ahead of the European monarchies that dominated Europe at the time, although a lot of things Napoleon did were wrong judging him by today's standards is presentism and ignores that the Europeans monarchies did the same things but were far worse.  
He wasn't as liberal as modern liberals are, and even though I'm not a fan of neoliberalism, I recognise it is an advancement from feudalism and totalitarian monarchism, and therefore can appreciate Napoleon.",,/r/europe/comments/gdtvht/on_this_day_in_trier_prussia_in_1818_german/fqgcptx/,AlyricalWhyisitTaken,1589342991

Flats were the preferred residence type in nine Member States, notably in Latvia (66%), Spain (65%), Estonia (62%) and Greece (61%). The lowest shares were recorded in Ireland (8%) and the Netherlands (20%).

By contrast, more than two thirds of the population lived in detached houses in Croatia (70%), followed by Slovenia (66%), Hungary and Romania (both 65%), Denmark (53%), Poland and Slovakia (both 50%). The Netherlands (58%) and Ireland (52%) were the only EU Member States where more than half of the population lived in a semi-detached house in 2018.

**7 out of 10 persons lived in an owner-occupied residence**

In 2018, seven out of every ten (70%) persons in the EU lived in a house or flat they owned. There were more owners than tenants in every EU Member State in 2018, with the highest shares of owners in Romania (96%), Slovakia (91%), Croatia and Lithuania (both 90%) and the lowest shares in Germany (51%) and Austria (55%).

5268,"To answer that we must look more closely at the actual ruling. The German constitutional court is of the opinion that the EU broke the EU treaties by giving itself powers that it wasn't granted by the member states (to be more precise, by the ECJ making one particular part of the treaties effectively null and void). That is in conflict with the German constitution simply because Germany is a democracy: All and every power needs to be derived from the people via elections and votes, any institution granting itself powers is obviously unconstitutional in that regard. Now, to take *democracy* out of Germany's constitution is simply unthinkable. Germans will tell you how this is impossible because of the eternity clause, but let's be real, no member state would give up democracy. And there's also a paradoxical element to this as the EU is a democracies-only club. And here's also additional food for thought: If the German court is actually right about the EU giving itself a power it wasn't granted, the EU is not only in violation of the German constitution but *every member's* constitution. So the smoothest solution is (if the ECJ won't budge) to amend the treaties. Some would say, me included, to give the EU the powers it actually needs in the proper way rather than through the back door. But amending the treaties is very hard, and there is a rather more simple solution, at least short term until another and then another constitutional court finds the same thing as the German one: Just have a vote in the German parliament that this is ok. That would restore democratic legitimacy at least within Germany and this whole thing would be over (for now).",European Union,/r/europe/comments/giadfy/the_karlsruhe_ruling_as_a_pretext_for_pis_poland/fqgfmql/,23PowerZ,1589345040

5273,"The range of possibilites for German politics is actually included within the court's ruling: 

&gt; Where measures taken by institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the European Union exceed the limits of the European integration agenda (*Integrationsprogramm*) in a manifest and structurally significant manner, it is incumbent upon the Federal Government and the Bundestag to actively address the question how the order of competences can be restored and to make a positive determination as to which course of action to pursue [...]. Constitutional organs are afforded wide political latitude in this context. They may retroactively legitimate an exceeding of competences by initiating – within the limits set by Art. 79(3) GG – an amendment of EU primary law [...] and, by way of the procedure set out in Art. 23(1) second and third sentence GG, formally transfer the sovereign powers that were exercised *ultra vires.* However, where this is either not possible or not wanted, the constitutional organs are required to use legal or political means to work towards the rescission of acts not covered by the European integration agenda (*Integrationsprogramm*), and – as long as such acts continue to have effect – to take suitable action seeking to limit the domestic impact of such acts to the greatest extent possible [...].

5356,"The square root does not provide the fairest representation. Each voter from a large country will have a smaller say in policy than a voter in a larger country. It's just a slightly less bad version of our senate. But ultimately the real reason why your proposal fails to be truly representative is because it is a single representative system. One election, one winner.

Let's look at the 2019 election in Malta. Labour got 53% of the votes, Nationalists got 40%, Imperium Europa got 3%, and Democratic Party got 2%. Labour sent 4 MEPs and Nationalists sent 2. Suppose there was a imaginary 5% shift from Nationalists to Labour next time around, resulting in 58% Labour and 35% Nationalists. While I'm not expert on the details of how many MEP's get determined, I'm pretty sure that it would still be 4 Labour and 2 Nationalist. So despite quite a significant shift in public opinion, the election result is the same. That is not representative. All your system would do is tweak the divvying and not address the underlying problem. In my system, the real Maltese election would result in 4 MEP's being sent from Malta. The Labour MEP would have 275109 votes in parliament, Nationalists 192043, Imperium Europa 16040, and Democratic Party 10266. Going back to my example of the 5% shift, the Labour MEP would have 300429 votes in parliament, Nationalists 166732, Imperium Europa 16040, and Democratic Party 10266. This means the MEP's voting power is actually tied to those who they represent and shifts in public opinion are more accurately reflected in parliament. Also any election shenanigans that may occur will necessarily only have a localized effect.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/gi6zbw/europe_needs_to_be_a_superpower_not_a_superstate/fqg3h24/,erik542,1589337177

the risk these perpetrators presented to their own children and the
children they met throughout their daily activities. One of our interviewees explained to us: “They weren’t viewed as sex offenders per se, just a group of men of all ages, from one ethnicity taking advantage of kids from dysfunctional backgrounds. It could have overwhelmed child protection. There had to be a degree of pragmatism, the children also had to manage their own behaviour, the education issues were far greater than the enforcement issues.” 
Also the minutes of two different meetings that were held could not be found(nothing shady there)

5447,"Don't mix up the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. For the parliament, I absolutely want one person, one vote (see below). But the council is completely different, and it doesn't even represent people in the first place.

The point of the Council of the EU is to be an intergovernmental body, so the elected governments (executive branch) of EU countries vote on EU wide legislation. That's very much unlike anything that the US has, which may be what confuses you. It's similar to the Federal Council (Bundesrat) of Germany. In such a body, the square root provides the fairest representation, because it gives each voter the same voting power. In a small country, each voter is more likely to swing the national vote. Swinging the vote in a country with more votes in the council is more likely to swing the overall outcome. The square root is what balances these two factors out. Mathematicians worked on this one, it's not something anybody here is pulling out of their ass.

&gt; Now we just need to deal with the simpler problem of fairly dividing political votes. Fortunately the answer is fairly straight forward. Periodically, each country will have a national election that will elect their delegation. The delegation will consist of the top 4 vote earners in the election. Just 4 people per country, be it Germany or Malta. The real magic comes from how votes are done in the parliament. The total voting power for each country's delegation is equal to that country's population. Each delegate's voting power will be based off their results in the election.

That's a terrible idea for so many reasons, and when it comes to the European Parliament, there are much better ways to do it. Hell, even the way we are doing it now is way better.

But my proposal would be to do an EU wide proportional representation. The actual lists of candidates are made for each country, but when it comes to assigning seats to parties, European parties that run in multiple countries have all the votes added up. For the exact assignment, pick one of the methods that slightly favors bigger parties, so the national ones have an incentive to run together with parties from other European countries. EPP, PES, ALDE, EGP, EL, etc. We already have them. But national parties that run in only one country will still get their share of seats. When it comes to actually assigning the seats of a European party to the respective national ones, this can again be done using proportional representation, but this time using a system that slightly favors small parties, so essentially the first 27 seats a party gets go to candidates from every country, if it ran in every country.

The effect is that the total distribution is proportional, each vote counts equally, no vote is wasted even if the respective party is unpopular in your particular country, but citizens from small countries still have multiple local representatives, probably one per major party.

How did you get that data that in all of Bosnia when searching for a specific phrase you get these pages? Also Google doesn't show the most resulted page most of googles front page is cherry picked determined by an algorithm based of cookies and past searches along with sponserd sights who give google direct money. Bing actually does what you claim. 

"" If this behavior is condemned by the Islamic society in Bosnia, then this Islamic society should also make sure that the guy can't preach, and that he has no voice on the internet neither. ""

All mosques and religious institutions not deemed acceptable by the Bosnian Islamic community is subjected to taxes, is not allowed any government funds, can not hold public appearances or debates, has to display a sign saying they are not affiliated with the community, and other measures to stop the spread of these types of mosques and schools. Yes let's give a religious institution the capability to silence speech on the internet that doesn't sound idiotic at all. This can be attributed to any religious hierarchy, Why doesn't the catholic church go around and ban like this one ""[https://www.timesofisrael.com/polish-bishop-delivers-thinly-veiled-anti-semitic-sermon/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/polish-bishop-delivers-thinly-veiled-anti-semitic-sermon/)"", why doesn't the Greece orthodox head Priest ban this church ""[https://eurojewcong.org/news/communities-news/greece/greek-jews-slam-antisemitic-remarks-by-orthodox-bishop/](https://eurojewcong.org/news/communities-news/greece/greek-jews-slam-antisemitic-remarks-by-orthodox-bishop/)"", etc. We live in a democracy with freedom of speech I don't like what they are saying but they have the right to and no religious authority be it right or left leaning has a say on it.

"" The second result is citations from the Quran, also very negative. ""

What a Abrahamic religious book talks bad about certain people, no way. I guess the bible is evil because of this passage  Jhon:44 Ye are of your father the adevil, and the blusts of your father ye will do. He was a cmurderer from the beginning, and abode not in the dtruth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a elie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a **f**liar, and the father of it. Saying jews are the devils people is okay I guess as long as they come out the right book.

And again this sight has direct funding from Saudi Arabia with no Islamic community approved Bosnian organisations.

"" So Bosnia is a country where the most sought after internet sources for how to deal with Jews explicitly speak against Jews. ""

Again you need proof to back this up all you did was post a page post your search result and lets see the pages. because when i search ""quran jews"" in Bosnian in google I get

So what do you think is the most probable course of action for Germany? Changing the constitution or trying to change the EU law?

&gt;Think of it like you're a devout religious person and you live in a country that has a law that demands that you do something.  The country's law is going to say that it is the most-important system of rules and will punish you for disobeying it.  But a true, fervent believer will follow God's law regardless of what the country's law says, even if it means that he has to go to jail or flee the country or similar.  Saying ""the Bible demands that I do X"" is not going to work as a defense in that country's courts as an excuse for not following the law…but God's law is still going to, in practice, determine what you do anyway.  The secular law here is like EU law and the Bible like the constitutional requirements.

Actually buying a handful of the better low cost hosting providers in Europe with decent margins who would otherwise be their competitors would be peanuts for Schwarz and would instantly get them a solid big footprint and a customer base, so if they're willing to use enough capital, they could get big very quickly.

It'd still take a lot of investment to compete with AWS on breath of functionality, but personally I'm a big fan of Hetzners slow and steady approach to it - figure out which AWS services come up as roadblocks to migrating customers over, and build alternatives specifically to those parts and learn from Amazons experimentation.","Norwegian, living in UK",/r/europe/comments/gi6qzg/lidl_owner_launching_its_own_rival_to_amazon_web/fqf4kmh/,rubygeek,1589318620

5582,"Building nuclear power plants is expensive but running them and actually generating energy is cheap. Nuclear generates more energy by area. An average nuclear power plant in the US needs 3.4x.3.4km to produce one gigawatt hours of energy a year. Wind energy would need triple (for wind) or quadruple (for solar) the space to generate as much energy. Plus nuclear isn't as reliant on the weather as wind&amp;solar.

We could reduce costs of building and running a nuclear power plant by a lot if we invested more in LFTR. As if the advantage of regular nuclear wasn't enough, Thorium power plants are even better. Regular uranium using nuclear power plants generate nuclear waste that stays radioactive for tens of thousands of years while Thorium halflife is 300 years. One ton of Thorium also generates 35-200 times more energy than uranium.

5612,"First of all, it’s the hundredth time I’ve said this, Italy and France **already** put EU law above their national one, it’s Germany that doesn’t.

Then, regarding the help you’re concerning yourself with. The supplies Germany sent were help, after having stopped all commerce of medical equipment with Italy and stopped all shipments too. While we were telling everyone this thing was going out of control, they left us hanging dry. Only after the Italian outcry for decency and solidarity amongst members did everyone get their senses back, like Lagarde, van der Layen and Germany too. And like you said, only later did Germany lift the restrictions for medical equipment to be **sold** by a private entity doing business, they didn’t give us anything, they simply lifted the despicable bans on selling them. And it was 100 ventilators in 1 day, not a day. This is what I’m talking about, how Italians feel about this, because that is what happened (without even talking about the Eurobonds and now this). I don’t think Germany should help with supplies, because, to be frank, that is not what Italy needs. I’d be grateful if they majorly helped medically, but it’s not what’s needed. We need a European response, and it looks like Germany and other northern countries don’t want the same, consistently putting themselves solely before others. Germany needs the bloc, the Netherlands even more, we need the bloc too, this is a symbiotic relationship, we should act like it is.

I personally do not support the governments of China and Russia, as I am not stupid and can easily see through their actions. But this doesn’t accredit what Germany did.

Between the eurobonds and this, Germany has consistently been rowing in the opposite directions of finding a united European economic solution.

Italy has been pushing the whole time for being united. It would’ve been incredibile to have shared interest rates with the eurobonds, it would not have been shared debt. Italy would’ve payed for it, like we’ve always done, we’ve never defaulted before, unlike Germany (I don’t mean this as an insult, I’m just trying to put things clearly). Italy hasn’t been hostile, quite the contrary, it’s been pushing for unison. Can you seriously tell me that is not the case? It’s the fact that the sentiment isn’t reciprocated by northern governments that is creating all this eurosceptiscism.

I don’t think anyone would benefit if someone left, but the scepticism is rising in Italy with this crisis, mainly because of the lack of a response. If Italy, a founding member left, the reputation of the Union would fall tremendously, and I don’t want that. I would want Germany to be less difficult when progressing with the situation. 

What do you personally think Italy should change about its stance in respect to the crisis, which I’m guessing your alluding to the fact that it should, I would like to hear it.",Milan,/r/europe/comments/ghkgky/european_commission_threatens_to_sue_germany/fqeoud1/,talentedtimetraveler,1589311142

5676,"&gt;Yes because France is the only European countries with neo-colonies in France

I uh.. What. Theres so much wrong here i don't know how to start honestly.

The only proper ""neo-colony"" France has is French Guiyana. Every other of the only 5 remaining Département et région d'outre-mer is a small island. France has apart from their language lost all direct influence over Africa and is decidedly NOT looking to reexert it.

The country you could rightfully scold in Europe for holding way too much undeserved non-mainland territory is the United Kingdom. The country with actual colonial disputes in Africa is Spain (Morocco). 

&gt;just like NATO ended up fighting in the Middle East.

Which were American ordered and France is the only country who enthusiastically followed. That doesn't really fit into the picture you painted.

&gt;The only difference is that the US showed a clear interest in keeping its defense promise when it comes to my region, France has not.

Has the US?

The US has a clear interest in selling their military equipment one way or the other, thats why they so enthusiastically build military complexes in other countries. That doesn't mean that this is pure goodwill or that the people shouldn't have a nuanced view of them. Just ask Japan and South Korea on that one.

&gt; My country keeps getting blocked from Schengen even if we met the criteria back in 2012 and let's be honest, this hinders our economy more than anything, the argument about ""people invading other countries"" holds no ground

SIS II is not about ""people invading other countries"". It is the centralized database for entity tracing which is hugely important for open borders. And since SIS II went live in 2013, there is a reason you were denied in 2012 for only meeting SIS I standards.

&gt;we are already allowed to work wherever we want in the EU. 

Yes but you are exiting and entering the Schengen Area through border controls which means your data is being taken and could be potentially traced. No such thing with open borders which is why SIS II needs to exist. It's really not a hard concept to understand.

&gt;Yes, some strong-worded letters and economic sanctions.

Economic sanctions which obliterated Russias economic stability. You can't ciriticize the EU for not letting Romania into Schengen citing that it hurts your economy and then hand-wave hard hitting economic sanctions like that.

&gt;yet Germany's argument is that ""it's in our national interest"".

Again, no, it was the opposite. Germany kept arguing that it was an economic interest not a political one and other countries insinuated it was the other way around, which is why the EU commission has now assumed control over the project.


&gt;Look up Macron's speech about his rapprochement theory when it came to Putin's Russia. It's like 2 weeks old, so very recent.


It is 3 months old and he said this:

&gt;*""He said “we need in the* ***long term*** *to reengage with Russia but also emphasize its responsibility in its role” as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.""* ***It cannot constantly be a member that blocks advances by this council***.""

&gt;*He said that* ***he expects Russia will continue playing a destabilizing role in matters such as other countries’ election campaigns, either directly or indirectly***. *“I don’t believe in miracles—I believe in politics, in the fact that human will can change things when we give ourselves the means,” he said*.


&gt;*However, Macron argued that Russia’s military buildup is financially unsustainable. He also says an alliance with China would not be “durable,” in part because “Chinese hegemony is not compatible with the Russian sense of pride.” That, he added, points to the need for a “European partnership.”*

While I don't nessecarily agree with him, **nuance** and **context** are important. You're so dead set on your France is bad attitude that you entirely took his speech out of context. And Long term relations is incompatible with Putins Russia by the simple matter that Putin is 67 years old and can't really afford to pull a Mugabe considering how the economic oligarchy of Russia works.

&gt;Our president supported the German economic interest in the alliance, not Germany's membership.

""Maas even went so far as to propose German membership in the group. Reactions were mixed. Whereas the host, Romania's President Klaus Iohannis, supported the gesture""

We can look at another such example: the 3 seas initiative. It was initially dismissed by Germany and they were against it, unless they could be a part of it, so they could control its policies most likely. However, we're lucky the US has thrown its political weight behind this project and I really hope it will grow larger.

Before his fallout with Fettullah, Erdogan was secretly brokering a peace deal with PKK (which was called the 'peace/solution process').

5761,"&gt; How is getting all the people to agree on a constitution in any way easier than getting all the countries to agree on treaties?  

The point is that they just have to agree *once*.

&gt; The last attempt at an EU constitution literally failed to popular votes in France and the Netherlands, not exactly anti-EU.  

You never know if you don't try. But making the constitution more democratic would definitely be a good start. 

&gt; You realize you are arguing for less minority rights?  

Not really. Also, ""minority rights"" isn't really a factor, because a country isn't a minority, and notably, every single country is ""small"" compared to the rest of the EU.

Giving member states more power rather than the EP mainly means strengthening the strongest member states. This may sound counterintuitive but it's true. Without the EU, bigger countries in Europe would be more dominating than they are today, not less. By giving power from the council to the EP, big countries lose a lot of their influence. Small countries lose influence, too, but not much, because they had less to begin with.

And no, having many MEPs doesn't give a large country like Germany power because those MEPs don't vote based on the German government's wishes. The German conservative MEPs are going to vote with other countries' conservative MEPs, the German socialist MEPs are going to vote with other countries' socialist MEPs, etc. 

Look at Germany's system: it also has a parliament that is elected by the people and that elects the government, and a council that consists of the state executive, with roughly square root voting power. People bitch about different states all the time, but it never gets as vile as in the EU, and part of the reason is that the council's role is a lot weaker than in the EU, so even powerful states like Bavaria can't really push everybody else around to an extent that is similar to how Germany can push small EU members around.

Another problem about the current system for the council is that it doesn't only give small members an advantage by giving each country one vote independent of its size, but it also gives large countries essentially a veto power, by demanding that the countries voting ""yes"" contain 65% of the population. Getting rid of the double majority means getting rid of Germany's and France's dominance. The square root is the most democratic way, and there are mathematical reasons for that.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/gi6zbw/europe_needs_to_be_a_superpower_not_a_superstate/fqebp36/,muehsam,1589304926

That is true, though this could change in the future. First of all, massive demographic changes are taking place, and while immigrants integrate to various points, in general they tend to have far weaker links to their home countries. In many Western nations, up to a third or more of children have a migrant background, and this will grow.

Travel and growing cooperation in numerous work related fields could increase interactions between Europeans, breaking down the barrier of unfimiliarity. This might not always work in the short term (Britain had seen a strengthening of various links with the continent before it left), it is likely to reduce the \`otherness\` felt as pertaining to other Europeans.

5806,"The environmental footprint is far from the only problem stemming from such a dramatic population growth. Africa is already failing at keeping up with the population growth in several ways. 

Firstly, it can hardly provide jobs for its gigantic armies of youth, and that, in turn, is one of the greatest sources of instabilities of any kind (extremism, violence, refugee waves etc). Considering the poor economic performance of the continent, there are hardly any signs that would be changing. Even worse, many economists are estimating that labour-intensive jobs may already be in the process of disappearing, so good luck providing for all those people.

Secondly, its urban areas are unable to keep up the infrastructure development. African cities are already known to be lightyears behind European ones, but they won't be catching up because the masses that keep moving to cities are so huge that not only are slums bound to happen to every major city, it also brings crime and all the other problems with it. The poor urban planning is illustrated by countries like Egypt – which is rather wealthy for African standards – which just decided to give up on Cairo altogether and just build a new capital next to it.

Thirdly, even though in general, we could feed all the people in the world, still, food security might become a regional issue in Africa. Already now, many countries are importing food and the crops are affected by locusts. Add the problem with clean water, climate change (desertification etc). Africa might be big but 4 billion people is a lot, especially for the least developed continent.

5832,"&gt; It's definitely considered a security threat to several EU members and other countries in the EU don't give a fuck about it and either wanna get closer to them (France) or they are already ensuring further energetic dependence on them (Germany). The difference today is that Eastern Europe still has the US when it comes to help against Russia (even if Western Europeans foam at the mouth when they see the word American), but in a ""united Europe"", this might not be the case. For some better deal, they might end up giving Latvia to the Russians, since it has not much of a relevance for them.

Holy Assumptions Batman.

For once, the ""American Security"" that you're referencing is the NATO - which not only most EU countries are apart of, but also which wouldn't necessarily change if one were to federize the EU. A Military Defense agreement on the basis of hostile takeovers doesn't really care about the state the protected area is in. And as it stands, the biggest threat to NATO falling apart is not the federation of Europe and more the systemantic dismantling of EU-American relationships by the US itself with their current administration. You can't blame the Western European Countries for strained relations with the US when the US has had tons and tons of negative interactions with them in the last 3 years. 

Next up, there is none, literally zero reason why a federalized EU would give up Latvia to the Russians. This isn't 1938 and we aren't in Munich here, not only do we know how that ends we also strictly and pretty much univocally condemn that stuff. The EU reaction to Crimea alone was already unanimously negative, and you think the EU as a country would do that voluntarily?

And lastly, Trade relations and certain projects are not equivalent to alignment of world view. We can still do trade with Turkey and reject their territorial claims. And Nord Stream 2 also does not ""ensure further energetic dependence"", it just ensures a more convenient trading route (which by the way is the reason the pipeline is controversial in the first place - not because it's a Russian-German project but because the countries the Gas is currently routed through will be missing out on transit payments [this does not include the South Stream controversy but it's the bulk of the reason why Nord Stream 2 was in the media]). Just like TEN-V 24 doesn't ensure ""further economic dependence"" of the associated countries. Also fun fact, eventhough the pipeline goes to Germany, the European Commission has assumed oversight of the project as it is a trade project with a country in the European Union.

No you don't. Cultural differences don't matter much in a federation because a federation is not a centralized unitary state. What you actually need is some formalisms:

* a constitution that can be changed by the EU itself rather than treaties that everybody has to agree on;
* more power for the EP, in particular the right to introduce legislation and the right to elect the commission, ideally a voting system that counts every vote equally while at the same time making sure small countries have adequate representation;
* less blocking in the council, for example by requiring only a simple majority, and giving each country a number of votes that corresponds to the square root of their population;
* moving a few extra powers to the EU level, namely foreign policy, defense, and basic taxation (leaving room for members to have their own taxes on top)

5894,"Stopping the spread of the virus hasn't been the solution since it got out of China. Covid is closely related to the periodic outbreaks of SARS we've already been having, and developing a vaccine for those has proven to be effectively impossible despite significant interest from countries like China, so we shouldn't have high hopes that an effective vaccine will be forthcoming for the Covid. Sweden is on the right track with its ""isolate the vulnerable, let the rest get it"" strategy, the reason their statistics are so bad is because it got into their elderly care homes early, and because they didn't have a sensible stockpile of medical equipment. Yes, their strategy is going to cause a much steeper curve initially, but with the periodic resurgences the isolation strategies are going to cause, the numbers will eventually even out. It's now been conclusively proven that you can only get sick once, so herd immunity is the correct action.  
  
I'm not just saying that because I've already had it and the lockdown measures annoy me. They cause an inordinate amount of damage to the economy, while we're already facing an economic crisis, and when money starts drying up liberal democracies inevitably turn to ""socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor"" mindsets. The people who already have vulnerable finances will now face an economic depression amplified by the disease. They will lose their jobs and get the corona anyway.  
  
I have a pretty weak immune system, I'm borderline vulnerable myself, but I got less sick from the Covid than I get from influenza. That's not some rare scenario, the vast majority of otherwise healthy people who get it will recover with similar stories, antibody testing has shown that many sick don't even know that their generic cold two weeks ago was actually Covid.  
There are two main reasons everyone is panicking over the death statistics. The first is because the media is reporting about them in the first place (and doing its best to write scary headlines so people will buy newspapers, because that medium has been dying for a long time). If media had similar reports about influenza deaths, or cancer deaths, or traffic accident deaths, Covid wouldn't look that different. But nobody buys those headlines, so they don't bother. The second reason is because the death statistics get inflated by zealous medics. If a 97-year old grandmother dies while sick with the Covid, it gets reported as a Covid death, but in this situation she would likely have died if she'd gotten influenza, or even just a cold. Cancer patients get reported as Covid deaths, heart attacks get reported as Covid deaths, I've even heard anecdotally (from a nurse friend) that someone was run over by a bus and got reported as a Covid death just because he had tested positive. Certainly in many cases the Covid is a contributing factor, but if the same person would have been likely to die without the Covid, or with any other disease, is it really correct to report it as a Covid death? It's no coincidence that as Covid deaths rise, deaths from cancer and heart attack sink.",Россия,/r/europe/comments/gi5k9t/german_court_cancels_mandatory_14_day_quarantine/fqdgjg2/,ShoshaSeversk,1589289179

5948,"&gt;I would say that it depends on what the issue is here. If we can expect China to ""hold Greece hostage"" by not using its port or something like that then yes that would be a bigger blunder. But if the problem is just the size of the debt and the corruptive effects of close relations with China (like I would say Bulgaria is hurt by some of our oligarchs being close with Russian oligarchs and all the economic, political and media influence that creates) then I think Serbia is more vulnerable than Greece. Maybe not considering Greece has to worry more about debt but then I guess it depends on whether that Chinese influence would be outrageous enough to be resisted and require threats or whether it would be consensual. 

True, but that's a bunch of maybes, in real terms, Greece is way more unstable currently and if China would tighten it's politics a bit, Greece would be at risk, i remember reading something about Greece being the only EU member voting against something about China, cant remember what. 

&gt;He also called them hypocrites which is undeniably an insult. This talk of solidarity doesn't stand right to me because it looks like solidarity is a one way street. 

Honestly i don't remember him using the word hypocrite?

&gt;This talk of solidarity doesn't stand right to me because it looks like solidarity is a one way street. Like Italy wants solidarity from Germany even though Germany is experiencing the same problem. Why isn't Italy showing solidarity with Germany? Even if we assume only Italy should be helped because it has the bigger problem then still Italy should be sending supplies to Spain which has had a worse outbreak

But that was the problem, Italy was the hardest hit, yet it was royally fucked over by other EU states grabbing its supplies and EU not allowing export of medicinal equipment. It was a shitshow. 

&gt;Serbia should also have been sending supplies to the EU given that it was less affected. It didn't and you know that's perfectly understandable, of course if there's a lack of life saving equipment you would prioritise your own people first. 

We've sent aid though, specifically to Italy and we donated i think to the EU and UN. 

&gt;I don't have a problem with that but it does seem somewhat wrong to me when others have a problem with other countries doing the same, just because they expect more form the richer countries. Like just because they're rich and can afford to give their friends money, doesn't mean they can afford to give out what is essentially lives. Not like Italy helped Spain either. 

But Italy was as fucked as Spain was at  the moment  

&gt;120 ventilators sounds like very little but this kind of equipment was actually very rare. 120 is nearly 2 per 100k people for Serbia which would produce a visible bumb in graphs like this. 

Indeed, but it was still a small number, for instance our Tennis player that isn't even active bought 35, so really not that much of a number, although grateful for it. 

&gt;I agree (at least among current candidates). What I mean is rather that Albania had problems becoming a candidate (got 3 vetoes unlike MK's 1) so maybe if the EU wasn't a bit more interested in the Balkans Albania might not even be a candidate right now. So that's my one example where maybe more EU interest could have helped a Balkan country. 

Indeed, but they got that candidate status due to increased Russian and Chinese influence, why would the 3 vetos drop now of all times? Do you think things improved in like 6 months enough for 3 vetos to stop?

&gt;Yes it's not difficult but without your explanation about wanting to please the government there just wouldn't be an incentive for a private newspaper to buy such useless for it ads. 

Eh, informer is pretty retarded when it comes to 'newspapering', a few days ago Vucic's son got photographed with criminals for a third time, the reaction of one of the journalists of informer was 'LeAvE tHe KiDs ALoNe' - he's 22 and he's spending his time with criminals, he stopped being a kid a long time ago

&gt;Yeah the EU is beyond bad at PR, the best evidence is its total inability to contest all the lies about it during the Brexit referendum even as it was very important for it to do so. As an EU fan it's sad to see it taking so much criticism for things that aren't even true or aren't objective. I don't see how that can be helped given that I don't want it to be as good at PR and propaganda as China and Russia are, because it wouldn't be a democratic EU then.

Well for instance, they did massively good PR when they helped Serbia rework the Golubac fortress, there was (and i think still is) a massive EU flag on it, next to the Serbian one on the fortress, and it was shown everywhere and people loved it. 
They should invest more in some things that people see. Behind-the-curtain work is good, but people don't actually see it, it's not that transparent as well, but flashy things like that do, and turn public opinion really well (like China showed, 4-5 years ago and nobody here gave a crap about China)","""Свиће зора верном стаду,слога биће пораз врагу!""",/r/europe/comments/ghurz6/chinas_balkan_investments_are_paradoxically/fqdh9gz/,Helskrim,1589289632
