With all due respect, this is not a bad song, but I'll take ABBA's Waterloo any day over this, hands down. Wouldn't even win in 1974. Not a bad a song, but nowhere near as exceptional as you think it is. Not event that unique..

In any case, this is basically the penultimate step in the r/europe merry-go-round of datasets we're witnessing. Someone posts GDP. It's 'more useful to look at income'. Someone posts mean income. 'It's more useful to look at it PPP adjusted'. Someone posts mean income PPP adjusted. 'It's more useful to look at the median not the mean'. Someone posts that. ""That's better, because ...."".

The problem is submarines could not operate effectively if they stuck to the rules of war.

184,"That is actually just a really poorly named machine, lol. Pardon me while I vent...

Plants (on land) definitely do generate O² obviously, but most people don't realize that the plankton in the sea are the primary generators of oxygen. So much so, it would be accurate to say they are *almost* the sole source of it. There is roughly 21% O² in the regular ""room air"" we breathe (as it's called). The vast majority remaining is nitrogen. This ""plant"" pictured doesn't actually *generate* oxygen; but rather, uses a rather simple system to *concentrate the existing oxygen* in the air.

Most commonly, this process utilizes a membrane of silica which traps most of that nitrogen, leaving almost pure oxygen to be captured (or 'concentrated'). This can then be compressed and inhaled directly or injected into gas cannisters (like you often see folks carrying behind them on wheels or in a backpack). It's not perfectly pure 100% oxygen, but somewhere between 94 to 98% in most cases.

Alternatively, instead of the oxygen tanks we're all familiar with, you may have also seen folks also carry little machines with them with cannulas connected to them. This is pretty much the exact same technology but on a much smaller scale to make them portable.

Anyhoo, if too much plankton die from the oceans heating up too fast, we as a species are in for a real bad time. You don't hear enough about this when the topic of climate change is commonly referenced. You'd think it'd be stressed that if we fuck this up big enough, we literally run the risk of suffocating our entire species (and most oxygen-dependent life altogether).",,/r/europe/comments/n6935z/german_air_force_delivered_o2_generating_plant_in/gx8v4v7/,kaprixiouz,1620369275

295,"The [RMS Lusitania](https://imgur.com/a/r4gZunl) was a British ocean liner, the sinking of which by a German U-boat on May 7, 1915, contributed indirectly to the entry of the United States into World War I.

The Lusitania, which was owned by the Cunard Line, was built to compete for the highly lucrative transatlantic passenger trade. Construction began in 1904, and, after completion of the hull and main superstructure, the Lusitania was launched on June 7, 1906. The liner was completed the following year, at which time it was the largest ship in the world, measuring some 240 metres in length and weighing approximately 31,550 tons; it was surpassed the following year by its sister ship, the Mauretania.

Although luxurious, the Lusitania was noted more for its speed. On September 7, 1907, the ship made its maiden voyage, sailing from Liverpool, England, to New York City. The following month it won the Blue Riband for fastest Atlantic crossing, averaging nearly 24 knots.

In May 1915 the Lusitania was returning from New York to Liverpool with 1,959 passengers and crew on board. The sinkings of merchant ships off the south coast of Ireland and reports of submarine activity there prompted the British Admiralty to warn the Lusitania to avoid the area and to recommend adopting the evasive tactic of zigzagging, changing course every few minutes at irregular intervals to confuse any attempt by U-boats to plot her course for torpedoing.

The ship’s captain, William Thomas Turner, chose to ignore these recommendations, and on the afternoon of May 7 the vessel was attacked. A torpedo struck and exploded amidships on the starboard side, and a heavier explosion followed, possibly caused by damage to the ship’s steam engines and pipes. Within 20 minutes the Lusitania had sunk, and 1,198 people were drowned.

The Lusitania was carrying a cargo of rifle ammunition and shells (together about 173 tons), and the Germans, who had circulated warnings that the ship would be sunk, felt themselves fully justified in attacking a vessel that was furthering the war aims of their enemy.

The loss of the liner and so many of its passengers, including 128 U.S. citizens, aroused a wave of indignation in the United States, and it was fully expected that a declaration of war would follow, but the U.S. government clung to its policy of neutrality.",,/r/europe/comments/n6qybj/on_this_day_in_1915_german_submarine_u20_sinks/gx8p3eb/,Vucea,1620364547

309,"The specific words are critical to differentiate, and unintuitive. Propellers are just the fan blades that you can see. They need a power source to spin them. Early planes used something similar to a car's internal combustion engine, with pistons that explode gasoline causing a thing to rotate. These are very heavy for their power output, which limits the size and carrying capacity of a plane.

Modern planes use a jet turbine to create the rotation that drives the propeller. A jet is just a combustion chamber that vents the combusted hot and expanded gasses out to the atmosphere, the afterburners on a fighter are an example of this. Turbojet or jet turbine engines use that exhaust to drive a fan to bring more air into the combustion chamber, allowing more complete combustion, and higher efficiencies. Modern jet turbine cores are efficient, powerful, and lightweight, making them a perfect source for any kind of propulsion based on rotational energy, because it efficiently turns fuel into rotational energy. They are not great at turning fuel into thrust, or rotation into thrust, so they need a fan to turn that rotation into air movement. Propellers do that in a very visible way, and turbofans do it behind a shroud.

So jet engines power a fan, either a propeller or a bypass fan on an airliner.",,/r/europe/comments/n6935z/german_air_force_delivered_o2_generating_plant_in/gx879y0/,prefer-to-stay-anon,1620353765

484,"Living in in New England but coming from Sweden, having lived in Germany, in my experience the eastern US is significantly more expensive than Germany in every regard short of gas and maybe some clothing. Food is exponentially more expensive, as is rent and property. In addition to taxes, you pay fees for literally everything, and the taxes on the whole are only marginally lower. It is admittedly extremely difficult to compare taxes between nations, but I found myself having more left over at each month living in Sweden, the UK, or Germany, compared to living in New England. It's obviously anecdotal in this case. Not to mention car insurance. I have health insurance better than anything I've had in Europe due to my work, but if I had to pay for my own there's no way it would be worth it unless my salary was well in excess of $100,000 a year. 

Doing some research, it appears that both coasts are expensive, as are the majority of large cities or anywhere else anyone actually wants to live. The places in the US that are cheaper than say central and northern Europe tend, though of course exceptions exist, be middle America away from more popular cities and areas.

526,"Okay, if you are going to keep making straw men, this conversation is going to be over real fast. I didn't say religion makes good people do bad things. I said to make good people do bad things, you do need something like religion. There is a huge difference here. Not every religious person does bad things because of religion, and religion isn't the only way to do it. It is a very effective way, but dogmatic ideology and be used as well. In general, you have to convince someone it is a good thing to do something bad, and it is hard to do that when it comes to things like sexism, violence, and other forms of prejudice. It is no coincidence that religion is VERY strongly correlated with such things.

I said that religion mostly prevents progress, but *can* also make things worse. Every single time social progress is being made, the fundamentalists go mad. Sure, some switch sides, but they tend to be the moderates. Most LGBTQ+ friendly churches are moderate, agreed? Well, imagine that: The extent to which the religion is not a problem is to the same extent that it isn't taken seriously. Religion was used to justify slavery, segregation, racism, genocide, preventing women from voting, and even to prevent voting at all (""all leaders are appointed by god"" after all). Today it is still used to justify discrimination against the queer community, but at least most of those others are no longer accepted... Unfortunately, fundamentalists in both the US and Europe are FAR more likely to be racist and xenophobic. 

And then you prove my point by being anti-LGBTQ? And it sounds like you are also avoiding saying racist/xenophobic stuff straight out and instead you are buttering up the belief? 

Ironic... You are demonstrating the exact behaviors I am describing here. 

God doesn't exist, and why would I care if it had a plan for me anyway? No one has the right to plan your life for you. If a god exists, and it was racist, anti-LGBTQ, or sexist, that god is immoral and a piece of shit. Being a god might give it the power to destroy me, but that just proves it is a monster, not that it is right. 

The Bible commands genocide and slavery in the Old Testament. It tells the Israelites to go collect sex slaves at multiple points. It also says that some key figures had thousands of wives and concubines. Weird how suddenly it is now just one man and one wife. I also couldn't help but notice that prostitution was normal in the Old Testament and never once banned... And that marriage in the West was always more about property than family, and that it became a common practice long after the Bible was written. It only started to become a religious sacrament adopted by Christianity centuries after Jesus supposedly died.

Always this broken argument. Majority of your monthly cost of living goes to energy consumption, rent, food and services which, when produced locally are way cheaper here. Yes I can have cheap good food, because food is produced by enormous number of local Polish producers.

562,"&gt; There was not such thing as ""Turkish Cypriot zone"" in 1955.

Not true. There were Turkish zones in all major cities, like Nicosia.


&gt; No Turkish Cypriot was attacked before 1958, unless he was a mercenary of the British forces who fought against EOKA.

Again false info and I see no point on going on this one.


&gt; If we go with your ""logic"" no population of any country is native, since human beings existed for 200.000 years, and people back then did not speak the languages we speak today.

Well man, you just didn't get my point. I am saying that Greeks weren't ""natural native"" population, as you call them. And Cypriot Turks are equally native to Cyprus as Cypriot Greeks.


&gt; Clearly your logic is bullshit

Very mature and science-based argument. Go on like this, show us, barbarians, your amazing culture


&gt; In this discussion you are taking the side of the foreign rulers of Cyprus, while I am taking the side of the native Cypriot people who had been oppressed by those foreign rulers and had every right to fight for their freedom.

No, you speak just for a part of natives, a part of one local community.


&gt; It is the Turks who committed genocide against the Armenians

What this has to do with our topic?


&gt; So being part of the British and previously Ottoman empires, against the will of the majority, was fine and no danger to anybody, but being part of Greece was?

Well under British rules all the people were safe, had their own parliament, were in control of schooling etc. Greece, on another hand, was an open threat to native Turks.


&gt; And somehow partition, which would involve the ethnic cleansing of 100s of thousands of people, was also fine?

Partition can be done in another ways too. Example is the same Cypriot constitution with separate municipalities.


&gt; Don't confuse a constitution with democracy. South Africa during apartheid also had a constitution, one which was not democratic and discriminated against the majority of the population. The democratic thing to do with such racist constitutions is to reform them, and make them democratic. As I said earlier, in Cyprus a racist constitution was imposed, which discriminated against the majority.

So according to you Apartheid is equal to a state with some qualities of a federation?


&gt; And Greece wouldn't oppress Cypriots either. Rhodes united with Greece in 1947. Is Rhodes oppressed?

No, Rhodes wasn't full of Turks. Crete was, and I believe you know what happened to them after Greece to control on the island.


&gt; but you keep ignoring the fact that Turkish Cypriot started it.

Because they didn't.


&gt; Akritas plan was about achieving enosis

Yeah, and this was only possible to achieve after eliminating Turks.


&gt; It was not agreed because we don't agree to it.

Exactly


&gt; Would Turkey give veto power on everything that happens in Turkey to the Kurds?

We speak about Cyprus here, not Turkey.



Tbh I am a bit tired of moving on with you. You give so less argument, you are very racist and insulting. 

According to you, my man, Greeks are like angels, cute and tiny, definetely did nothing wrong. On another hand, Turks, according to you, are just barbarians, conquering everything and starting conflicts. You even deny that Ottomans brought more positive than negative changes to Cypriot Greeks. You deny killings and ethnic cleansing caused by Greeks. You imply that I stated that Turks did nothing wrong, what I didn't. You constantly call them names, you are a racist and turkophobe. In the end, you have no understanding on how a western democracy works, and no it's not at all about ""just a majority vote"". 51% cannot vote for killing 49%. Neither about taking smaller communitee's rights, granted by constitution, or doing ethnic cleansing or mass murders by National Guard lead by general Grivas. This is not a western democracy. I never denied negative things done by the Turkish or Turkish Cypriot side, but they were and still are the victims of this conflict. And Greeks do everything to keep it this way, even when it costs for their own people. I am not sure do I want to reply to your ultra-nationalist (even fascist) rhetoric. It looks just like a waste of time speaking you. Good luck, I wish you not to be so racist. It is ok to be a patriot but please feel some compassion and check about the pain of Turks in Cyprus. If it will not happen to majority of Greeks, conflict will last forever.",,/r/europe/comments/n2mqoe/on_this_day_in_2004_cyprus_became_a_full_member/gx7f9zy/,Zoidbie,1620339706

Just like the EU the US doesn’t produce vaccines, it are the privately owned companies that produce them on EU or US soil. Some countries forbid the privately owned companies to export vaccines created on their territory. The EU does not tend do that and tries to guarantee free trade.

2) yes there is serious beef, tensions are rising again, because the isle of Jersey (very close to france) changed some fishing laws without informing the French gouvernement thus violating a treaty.

586,"&gt;I'm a Slovak from Vojvodina who lived for a few years in Slovakia and then in Czechia and believe me when I say that Croatia is more similar to Serbia and Montenegro than to Czechia and Slovakia. 

I'm from Croatia and I agree. People IRL don't even care about all this. It's just a Reddit thing or even more precisely, r/Europe thing. People do feel closer to Bosnia and Serbia than to Germany, Switzerland or Austria. People will use term ""domaće""(domestic) when talking about movies, music etc. from ex-Yu countries but will never use it for something that's German or Swiss.  

I don't even understand this ""we were in A-H for centuries and less than 100 years in Yugoslavia."" It doesn't matter. Those were just borders. Hypothetically speaking, if Vietnam had been in the same country with Japan before we would still place it in Southeast Asia. That's how regions work. You find geographical space that has similar features and call it somehow. 

International corporations won't open regional office in Zagreb and do business within Germany and Austria but rather within Bosnia and Serbia. Same with market research etc. They won't change that just because you will color Croatia on Central Europe maps.

So how does one judge which Anglo-French wars are important and which are not? In which way is the Hundred Years' War less important/impactful to the history of France or Britain than say the Napoleonic Wars. The result of the Hundred Years is what shaped everything that followed in both countries to begin with. That's why it is universally regarded as one of the most important conflicts in human history.

It would be great if the West would be completely economically free from China, but that is just not feasible right now. What I am saying is that the US/EU should take care of their own business first. THAT IS IT.

&gt;This not a choice between ultimate perfect good and ultimate evil but a choice between flawed democratic states and genocidal dictatorship. But your saying we should stay neutral and or not get involved protecting and containing a genocidal state.

And I choose the flawed democracy lol, I still think you don't understand my point. Why isn't the West concerned with decades long human right abuses in Israel, Saudi Arabia, the US, various European countries...? Because they are allies. Why are they concerned by human rights abuses in China? Because they are competitors. Are you not concerned about a conflict breaking out where neither side cares about human rights? Politicians will laugh their asses of while the people will suffer.

As for the Nazi Germany comparisons, they launched a full on military invasion on Poland, you cannot compare these situations.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It doesn’t matter if you think the West is combating China for moral or economic or for aliens for all I care.

If you look at the Middle East and countless wars for profit, the situation only got worse after they were given ""freedom"". There is great danger about conflicts being won by a side that doesn't really care about the people or human rights. Gadaffi and Saddam Hussein were absolute psychopats, but the middle east was better when they were in power then it is now. Why? Because the forces ""rescuing"" them weren't actually rescuing them, they cared about money and power, NOT human rights. (the whole middle eastern situation is much more complicated then this, but a great deal of responsibility boils down to this).

&gt;Genocidal China needs to be contained and not allow to be the global hegemony.

Absolutely, as well as the West. Only if the West (or part of it), intervenes with a moral imperative (essentially, noble intentions) can any hope for a global hegemony exist.

761,"&gt;The problem, as your British-born compatriot below found out, is that British ethnicity is a subset of British identity. He's getting kicked out, not because he wasn't born and bred in Britain, but because he doesn't have ethnic British heritage. I'd argue that 'British ethnicity' is a mirage but the Home Office have decided that you're not British if you're parents were born elsewhere. Some overlap. This reading of Britishness as having an ethnic component is inherently racist.

No it isn't because we're not the US, we don't have the concept of [unrestricted Jus Soli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_soli#Europe)

&gt;Yes it is, it's the very definition of an ethno-nationalist state. ""nations are defined by a shared heritage, which usually includes a common language, a common faith, and a common ethnic ancestry"" - the kind of country where people ask ""But where are you really from?""

No it's not, Nigeria is a framework with core ethnicities which prop up the concept of a Nigerian, it's not the reserve of one singular ethnic group, this is why I said that if a Korean went to Nigeria, they'd be accepted as Nigerian because plurality is baked into the system, whereas with Korean identity, which is ethno-nationalist, it isn't. 

&gt;You can't have a British identity until concept of a British subject exists. Before that, everyone is Scottish, Welsh, English, Indian. Afterewards they're British.

Wrong, it would be just a diluted form of identity like Scandinavian or Balkan

&gt;Just trying to lighten the mood, I'm not saying that you claim to be a druid.

You were trying to discredit my response by saying was in the realm of fantasy. 

&gt;No, I am trenchantly anti-Imperialist. But you have accused me of being Anglophobic, which is not the case.

It's not like their mutually exclusive positions and you are. 

&gt;We don't have any kind of 'citizenship being open to others who don't come from Ireland'. Anyone who is a citizen is fully Irish. It might stem from that fact that Irish people live all over the world and they often retire here and bring their children.

Irish immigration law is parallel to British immigration law, how do I know this? Because the stipulation of the Common Travel Area arrangements means they have to follow the same direction of travel, if that wasn't the case you'd be in Schengen. 

&gt; Unlike you over in Finchley, I work and socialise with people from Unionist backgrounds all the time. Whatever 'attitude' I have pales in comparison to advocating an ethnic basis for nationality, so I'm not too worried.

Yeah and I'm sure they'd appreciate your utter disdain for their identity masked by mock sympathy to their predicament. 

&gt;I still don't see the significance of England not being distracted when the Fenian risings took place. Are you saying that 1867 was a more convenient time for Britain?

I'm not the one who made the issue of distraction a focal point of the original argument, you did, so to repeat, the inconvienience is based on England being distracted and the time between 1867-71 was an example of that not being the case in geopolitical affairs. 

&gt;Well, why do you think they decided to tell Britain to do one during that timeframe, as opposed to any time in the previous hundred years? 'New Zealand British Subjects' were now not entitled to reside in Britain for longer than permitted by the EEC.

What, you mean over a decade *after* we joined the EEC? British citizens could vote in NZ elections until 75 and until 84 in Australia. You also seem to gloss over the fact that British immigration law changed from one where any Commonwealth citizen could come to the UK in 1949, to the point by 1969 it was in the process of being curtailed, four years before we joined the EU, so I see the situation with Australia and New Zealand just part of a longer ongoing process of dissassociation and a more formalised immigration structure. 

&gt;The irony I alluded to was that the modern Tory party then put a barrier in the Irish sea, they certainly wouldn't do that to Finchley. I don't see how stating that is Anglophobic.

They put a barrier in the Irish sea because they knew that it was easier to control their own Unionists than the para military types who lobbed mortar rounds at Downing street. It's Anglophobic because you deliberately misconstrued the quotation to ascertain that the English don't care about NI. 

&gt;'clusters of DNA groups which can direct a persons ethnicity beyond a reasonable doubt to a particular area.' That is literally stating that you can identify someone's nationality from their DNA. 

So 23&amp;me saying a percentage of a persons ancestry comes from north western Europe and is heavily present in the UK Ireland Denmark and Norway is identifying it as their nationality, erm ok. 

&gt;So the Home Office take the difference between ethnic and identity Britishness pretty seriously too. Maybe he should have told them that they were overlapping concepts.

No, they have restrictions on the application of Jus Soli, *just like Ireland does* we're not the USA. 

&gt;'there are clusters of DNA groups which can direct a persons ethnicity beyond a reasonable doubt to a particular area.' and 'Bullshit, British identity is an umbrella term with its foundation of that being one of the three nations from the island of Great Britain'

Correct, that isn't an ethno-nationalist position no matter how much you try and strawman it into existence. 

&gt;They never got representation in Parliament, like England, Scotland and Wales. You might also remember some other colonies who took umbrage at 'taxation without representation'. 

Wrong again, it had more to do with the antagonisms between the French and English communities in Upper and Lower Canada than it did with British Parliament, case in point [the Durham Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_Report)

&gt;The Jersey government didn't want the gunboats, ""Jersey's government said last night that they expected the protest to be ""peaceful"" but Boris decided on gunboat diplomacy anyway.

How do you know they didn't want the Frigate? The Jersey government doesn't have the ability to enforce the defence of its territorial waters and, the UK is responsible for Jerseys defence ffs. Oh and I love the way in which you completely ignore the threat of France cutting Jerseys fucking electricity supply before one ship even ventured to the island. 

&gt;As I said, the Irish Republic doesn't negotiate trade deals. We get the EU ones that the UK also used to have. Unfortunately the UK has less negotiating power now and isn't getting the same deals. It might pay off if the UK can get deals more tailored to what they produce, but they objectively won't be as good.

I guess Phil Hogan was a figment of Irelands imagination then. 

&gt;This enhanced partnership? Brexit: EU steals march in race for India trade deal as Johnson announces ‘enhanced partnership’

963,"6 killings in 5 weeks is not a statistically significant increase. Given that over the past years [26.5](https://www.statista.com/statistics/533961/sweden-number-of-homicides-by-gender/) women are killed per year (accounting for 20% of murder victims), the expected number of female victims in a 5 week period is about 2.5. The probability that in a random 5 week period 6 women are killed is then 5.3%.

But this is not a randomly chosen period, the period is chosen to start on a killing. So the next question is: if 26.5 killings happen per year, following a Poisson distribution, how often can you cherrypick a 5 week period with 6 killings? Using a Monte Carlo method I found this is possible on average 3.4 times per year.

In other words, there is absolutely no evidence of a surge in killings of women in Sweden.

972,"A sure sign of paying too much attention to politics is when the arguments of your own side begin to grate as much as those of the opposition. Currently number one in my personal sources of ennui is the frequent damning of the SNP by comparing them to Brexiteers, with their claims of self-determination, demonisation of the ‘other place’ (Westminster/Brussels, delete as appropriate), a certain unwillingness to face hard facts, and a tendency to be slightly economical with the actualité. And, of course, there is more than a grain of truth to the accusation.

Understandably, the SNP would reject the suggestion. After all, it is only the rank injustice of Brexit which has converted Nicola Sturgeon, a member of the SNP for 35 years, to the cause of Scottish independence.

But just because it winds up the cybernats doesn’t mean that it’s helpful to the Unionist cause. For one thing, it immediately validates the SNP grudge. It tells them their grievance is justified. Once you start down the path of ‘We can all agree that Brexit is terrible…’ you inevitably provoke people into working out ways to escape Brexit. The fact that the commentator class in both Scotland and England leaned heavily Remain is highly relevant here. Many of them really can’t think of a worse insult to attach to a political campaign than to compare it to Vote Leave. But that’s not a universal sentiment, not even in Scotland.

For one thing, 38 per cent of the Scottish electorate voted to Leave, including a third of SNP supporters. Why ignore or insult them? Also, while Brexit has proved problematic for specific industries and regions of the UK, on the whole it hasn’t been a total disaster. For most people, things have remained much the same. By inviting people to compare Scottish independence to Brexit, even if you suggest it will be worse, you are actually downplaying the impact. The degree of economic and social disruption would be incomparable, far more than just a somewhat larger knock to GDP.

Many observers also regard it as the height of hypocrisy for the likes of Michael Gove and Boris Johnson to argue against Scottish independence. How can they possibly support self-determination for the UK but refuse it to Scotland? It would be understandable if this case was being made by the nationalists, but the unionist cause is hardly going so well that it is free to spurn support from wherever it is offered. However, let’s examine the merits of the argument.

Just because something is good does not mean that more of it is necessarily better. For example, you might think that belonging to the EU is a noble act of pooling sovereignty with others to prevent war and promote harmony among nations. Does that mean that you would also welcome the pooling of sovereignty with Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco in a vastly expanded EU? Or why not just a single world government, where Europeans will have votes proportional to their 10 per cent of the population? You wouldn’t want to be on the wrong side of history, would you?

Alternatively, if you favour independence, why not independence for Orkney, Shetland, the Borders, the Kingdom of Strathclyde, Glasgow, or even Sauchiehall Street? Surely you wouldn’t cruelly deny them the right to self-determination? You might regard these as ridiculous propositions but in each of these cases there is a point on a sliding scale that you regard as optimum. Just because you put your preferred point in a slightly different place than other people doesn’t imbue you with some sort of moral superiority.

And so, if a person happened to strongly believe in the United Kingdom as presently constituted, it is perfectly coherent for them to neither want it to be subsumed into a supra-national organisation nor for it to be broken up into its constituent parts. In fact, a Leave/No voting combination is the most authentically pro-British position.

It is also surely less coherent to believe that the UK is in some way special but also that it could be absorbed into the EU project without any degradation of that uniqueness. Here we may get dragged kicking and screaming into a debate about British (or English) ‘exceptionalism’ and its deleterious effects, but if you wish to argue that remaining within the UK is the right course of action for the Scots, then it must be because the UK offers something more than any alternative option. And so logically you must be open to the proposition that the UK is special in a way that, for example, the EU is not.

That doesn’t necessarily mean the UK is an objectively better country than any other, but if the Scots had to choose to remain alongside anyone, it is surely hard to think of two more similar countries than Scotland and England. As James I and VI put it:

Hath not God first united these two kingdoms, both in language, religion, and similitude of manners? Yea, hath He not made us all in one island, compassed with one sea, and of itself by nature so indivisible?

We still share a language, religious observance is similar, and the British Social Attitudes Survey confirms that our 'similitude of manners' is still high, regardless of what the SNP say. To which you might add that we use the same currency, have the same Armed Forces, the same model of health provision, watch the same TV programmes, listen to the same radio, cheer for many of the same athletes, and any number of other similarities, with the deep family ties and history that befit a 314-year-old union.

But the view of the SNP is that somehow Scotland would more comfortably sit in the EU than in the UK? In which case I would challenge anyone to name an EU member state that is more similar to Scotland than England. (For those tempted to identify Ireland, government spending in the UK is 36 per cent of GDP compared to 24 per cent in Ireland and 45 per cent in Scotland; visits to the GP cost €65, and when did you last watch a programme on RTE or tune into the Gaelic football?)

Also, back in the EU, Scotland would wield a mighty one per cent of qualified majority voting rights. Some nationalists like to boast of being able to wield a veto, on a par with Germany and France, which displays nothing more than a brutal misunderstanding of how power is wielded. When Greece was being economically water-boarded and asset-stripped by the Troika, where was its veto? If the Scots feel ignored by Westminster, wait till they’re being ignored by Brussels, Paris and Berlin.

It’s understandable that people are still sore about Brexit. But membership of the EU is such an incomparably trivial matter compared to being an essential part of the United Kingdom. If that is something you believe, maybe it’s time to lay off the Brexiteers?",,/r/europe/comments/n68dod/scottish_independence_isnt_like_brexit_it_would/gx5itqd/,casualphilosopher1,1620310956

978,"**Brexit: why the situation is tense between France and the United Kingdom over fishing rights**

Paris criticizes the British government for issuing fishing permits in its territorial waters only sparingly, even though they are vital for French boats.

Four months after the conclusion of the post-Brexit agreement, the situation has become tense between London and Paris on the issue of access for French fishermen to the fishy British waters. Until the climax on Thursday morning, when more than 50 French fishing boats gathered in protest outside the port of St. Helier, the capital of the Channel Island of Jersey.

The agreement negotiated in late December in the context of Brexit provides for a transition period until the summer of 2026, when European fishermen will give up 25% of catches in British waters, the equivalent of 650 million euros per year. It then provides for an annual renegotiation.

European Union fishermen will therefore retain guaranteed access to the areas between 6 and 12 nautical miles off the British coast, where they traditionally went, until the summer of 2026. This area is known to be very fishy and often quieter to navigate. However, they must apply for new licenses.

The conditions of access of British fishermen to French waters do not change, said to AFP the director general of the National Committee of Maritime Fisheries and Marine Stockbreeding (CNPMEM), Jean-Luc Hall. But this represents only a handful of vessels - caseyeurs (boats using traps) in search of lobsters or crabs.

**What's stuck**

The French government and fishermen claim that London is breaking out of the Brexit agreement by tightening the conditions for fishermen to access British waters. To obtain their license, French vessels must thus demonstrate to the British authorities that they were already fishing in this area over the reference period 2012-2016.

In principle, there is no problem for large vessels equipped with ""Vessel Monitoring Systems"" (VMS), ""a kind of tracking device that records the positions of vessels"", according to Jean-Luc Hall, of the National Fisheries Committee. But it is much more complicated for vessels of less than 12 meters, for which this geolocation is not mandatory. Another pitfall: when a vessel is recent, entering the fleet since 2016, it must be proven that the boat it replaces was sailing in British waters, a ""painstaking task"", describes Jean-Luc Hall.

According to the French Ministry of the Sea, France has so far received 88 licenses, out of 163 requested, for fishermen from Hauts-de-France, and 13 licenses for 40 requested for their colleagues from Northern Brittany. To fish in Jersey, 41 licenses have been granted out of 344 requests. And according to Paris, these 41 licenses are accompanied by new ""unacceptable"" requirements.

Manche MP Bertrand Sorre (LREM) cited the example of a fisherman from Granville authorized to go to Jersey waters eleven days in 2021, and only to fish for scallops, while he previously went there ""on average 40 days a year"" to also take whelks.

**Vital access for EU fishermen**

A quarter of French catches in volume (about 20% in value) come from British waters. Dependence is even greater for Belgium (50% of its catches by value), Ireland (35%), Denmark (30%) and the Netherlands (28%), according to 2011-2015 figures. Spain, Germany and Sweden are also involved for a smaller share.

The fish eggs settle along the French coasts and as far as Denmark, nourishing areas because they are fairly shallow and sandy. ""When they become adults, they leave for the slightly deeper, colder and more oxygenated waters of the north,"" according to the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (Ifremer). In British waters, therefore.

In a statement on Tuesday, the Jersey government assured that it had ""granted the fishing licenses in accordance with the trade agreement"" reached between Brussels and London at the end of December. The situation is further complicated by the fact that Brussels and London have still not been able to agree on the adoption of fishing quotas for the stocks shared between the EU and the United Kingdom for 2021.

""There is probably a desire on the British side to keep some means of pressure on hand"", within the framework of the negotiations on these quotas, Jean-Luc Hall, Director General of the National Fisheries Committee, told AFP to explain the gradual delivery of licenses.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It’s hard to draw a line between EU and member states, because they are one and the same. If EU officials told numerous times that NMacedonia should change its name for beginning of negotiations and then Bulgaria veto it, it makes EU looks bad because its officials lied.

But they're really not the same. The EU is not responsible and doesn't control what its member states decide. EU institutions  only speak for themselves not the intentions of national governments. Even Luxembourg could stop accession of any new members   for the next 100 years if it wanted to.  That's part of why it's important to make sure new members are on the same page or why there are doubts about adding more vetoes in the EU.


&gt; Not to mention some of conditions sounds hypocritical. Using brake on people’s future to resolve something in favor of your country wouldn’t be friendly and neighborly, as EU paroles all the time.  

Not being friendly and neighbourly is already the perfect reason to veto North Macedonia.  How are we even supposed to have good relations with a country that lays claim to much of our history and turns hating us into a sport? Yes it was our mistake not to make it clear from the start and even trying to work it out with them with a good neighbourliness treaty. Should've just vetoed like Greece.  Now in stead of trying to  resolve issue NM is more focused on spreading fake news about what we want. Its government is even involved with some Slovenian institute spreading hateful and false rhetoric against Bulgaria. Good neighbours my ass. What are they even   waiting for.

Yes any naval coastguards won't work unless supported by multiple boats as many French boats have descended unto Jersey; the Royal Navy aids in that if they were to go into Jersey ports searching for French boats they'd escape and go away as a result of large ships present and if need to be warning shots.

It turns out that when you send people with guns who know how to kill people to deal with the situation, they turn to the tools that they know, and kill people. Even if it is by mistake.

a) the points i said
b) because the german constitution doesnt consider it as that. The constitution has a paragraph how a reunification of both german states is supposed to work.

A reunification by constitution includes the draft of a new ""complete german"" constitution.

1167,"**election results,** opinion polls, qualitative research, **a vote in Stormont**, **seats won at elections** and demographic data.

Assume  you are referring to the bold ones, the first could produce differing  numbers to the latter two depending on how they are counted, % of votes  by actual number across all constituencies to find a total consensus, by  party policy. The Stormont vote would be a simple yes no, but not truly  representative of the population as a whole, seats won would depend on  the policy of the party going into the election.

Others may disagree, but the first is the one that best indicates the will of the voters.

None of them appear perfect and election results are skewed by partisan voting and the non voters.

But, these are all indicators for the need of a referendum the result of which may differ to any result above.

Another  consideration is the agreement specifically states 7 years between  polls so the reunification parties may want a high level of certainty.

While  “the basic question of sovereignty is binary and majoritarian” UCL   says, the peace deal also underlines the need to conform to the ethos   of “reconciliation, tolerance, and mutual trust”, qualities not always   abundant in the entrenched communities of Northern Ireland.

Tanks are meant to primarily directly fight other tanks, so their design is optimized towards that, being heavily armored with powerful anti-tank weapons and with a crew compartment designed to support that role, that is to quickly find and destroy enemy armor. 

SP artillery on the other hand is primarily designed to support other units through indirect fire, so they only have armor that's good against small arms and shrapnel, but a bigger gun and with a cabin design explicitly geared towards servicing the gun and no real focus on direct target acquisition. 

APCs are primarily designed to carry troops, so they maximize carrying capacity, with only limited self defense armament and light armor much like that on the SP artillery. 

IFVs on the other hand are geared towards infantry support with a side of fighting other light armored vehicles, so compared to APCs they have more armor, heavier offensive weaponry, usually an autocannon, and less troop carrying capacity.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/n5xn8t/the_medical_staff_of_the_polish_military/gx4ucnm/,tabulae,1620296496

hurr durr look up lobbying. Dude... you don't get my position. I am NOT saying the UK government is impervious to dealing with corporations, I AM saying, that they are not just a mouth piece, as demonstrated by the digital tax.  


2) Your article just says it will be ineffective at taxing sales. However, if you read the gov article I provided you would see that the digital services tax isn't a sales tax. It's a tax to retrieve some of the value users bring to platforms via other means, such as advertising.  


A business increasing prices to tackle this is nothing new... but I guess that just means you are anti tax increases right? Because I mean... it will just lead to companies trying to avoid it.  


3) So get back on track. Stop trying to segue off into a world where I am pretending that corruption isn't real. YOU are the one who claimed that the tories digital service tax was just fanfare and they were not going to do it. Then when I show they did, you say ""it's not effective vs amazon's sale revenue"".

It can be in the debtor's interest to have the court handling this, because if a country's legal system permits, they can discharge debts and halt payments on debts and some other things.

But it can also be in the creditor's interest.  It isn't *just* a ""get out of debts"" button.  Even in the US, though in the US it's almost always debtors using it.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/involuntary-bankruptcy.asp

&gt;What Is an Involuntary Bankruptcy? 
&gt;
&gt;Involuntary bankruptcy is a legal proceeding through which creditors request that a person or business go into bankruptcy.

1439,"A row between the Irish and British governments is likely to erupt Thursday over British plans to give an amnesty to British soldiers accused of crimes during the Northern Ireland Troubles.

The plans which were leaked to British newspapers Wednesday night will involve a statute of limitations so that prosecutions for crimes committed up to the Belfast Agreement in 1998 are prevented – except for cases involving war crimes, genocide or torture.

The plans were reported as preventing the prosecution of British army veterans of the conflict, but some reports said they would apply to all sides in the conflict, including IRA members.

Reports also suggested that the British government intends to institute a South African style truth and reconciliation commission.

The leaks coincide with local elections taking place in England Thursday.

If the move proceeds as reported, it would be a violation of the 2014 Stormont House Agreement involving the Northern parties and the Irish and British governments.

Irish Government sources were taken aback, stressing it was a unilateral move by the British government.

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis visited Dublin for a meeting with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney on Wednesday, but it was not clear Wednesday night if the issue was discussed

In a statement late Wednesday night, a spokesperson for Mr Coveney said: “The Irish Government discussed with our UK colleagues the commitments of the Stormont House Agreement and strongly advised against any unilateral action on such sensitive issues. We reiterated that only through a collective approach can we deal with these issues comprehensively and fairly in a way that responds to the needs of victims, survivors and society as a whole. Victims and their families are the only priority.”

SDLP leader Colm Eastwood said it would be the “biggest betrayal of victims by the British government and will put a huge obstacle in the way of true reconciliation”.

“This is the most unprincipled and cynical British government in many years and that’s saying something. An absolute disgrace. Shame on them,” Mr Eastwood said in a tweet.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/n5zf4d/british_government_to_give_amnesty_to_soldiers/gx47g20/,PoxbottleD24,1620276599

1467,"Victory over the French at Pavia in 1525 left the forces of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, dominant in Italy. In 1527 these forces stormed the city of Rome and embarked on an orgy of destruction and massacre, terrorizing the population and humiliating Pope Clement VII.

Pope Clement had unwisely formed an alliance, the League of Cognac, to challenge Charles’s supremacy in Italy. Rome was not, however, attacked on the emperor’s orders, but on the initiative of imperial troops angry at not being paid. These ragged and hungry soldiers, including German Landsknecht mercenaries and Spanish infantry, mutinied and marched on Rome, under the command of renegade French aristocrat the Duke of Bourbon.

The walls of Rome were poorly defended, the city’s garrison numbering only 8,000 men, including the 2,000-strong Swiss Guard. On 6 May the rebellious imperial army launched an assault in the face of cannon and arquebus fire. The Duke of Bourbon was shot dead (allegedly shot by Benvenuto Cellini) but the men he had led swept into the city, killing everyone in sight, armed or not. 

The Swiss Guards fought bravely to defend St. Peter’s Basilica and created enough delay to allow Pope Clement to escape down a tunnel into the fortress of Castel Sant’Angelo. There he was besieged while the city was laid waste. 

In the event known as the Stand of the Swiss Guard, the Swiss, alongside the garrison's remnant, made their last stand in the Teutonic Cemetery within the Vatican. Their captain, Kaspar Röist, was wounded and later sought refuge in his house, where he was killed by Spanish soldiers in front of his wife. The Swiss fought bitterly, but were hopelessly outnumbered and almost annihilated. Some survivors, accompanied by a band of refugees, fell back to the Basilica steps. Those who went toward the Basilica were massacred, and only 42 survived. This group of 42, under the command of Hercules Goldli, managed to stave off the Habsburg troops pursuing the Pope's entourage as it made its way across the Passetto di Borgo, which was a secret corridor that still connects the Vatican City to Castel Sant'Angelo.

The Protestant Landsknecht felt particular hatred for Catholic Rome and its idolatrous Renaissance treasures—they stabled horses in St. Peter’s—but the Catholic Spanish equaled them in cruelty and destructiveness. Clement surrendered in June, agreeing to pay a huge ransom and cede substantial territory to Charles V who, although embarrassed by the brutal conduct of his troops, was happy to accept the advantage he had gained.

Often cited as the end of the Italian High Renaissance, the Sack of Rome impacted the histories of Europe, Italy, and Christianity, creating lasting ripple effects throughout European culture and politics.

The Sack had major repercussions for Italian society and culture, and in particular, for Rome. Rome, which had been a center of Italian High Renaissance culture and patronage before the Sack, suffered depopulation and economic collapse, causing artists and thinkers to scatter. The city's population dropped from over 55,000 before the attack to 10,000 afterward. An estimated 6,000 to 12,000 people were murdered.

So, in short:

Monarchism = Pretty dead as an ideology for most people

National Socialism = Alive and well, with some clever rebranding, of course. 

So calling them Nazi actions rather than *""That thing the Germans did 80 years ago and it's totes gone now""* does have some power. It's reminding the very much alive and breathing people who sympathize with it about what they're actually supporting. 

*""Hey shitheads, remember when your ideology was burnt to the ground by the combined effort of the rest of the world? Yeah those were fun times weren't they? See you next year.""*

1573,"He was about 5'4"" which was average height at the time (though most aristocrats and soldiers would be taller due to better nutrition). The ""Napoleon is short"" myth existed for three main reasons:

1) British Propaganda. Plain and simple, this is why most people think Napoleon was short, because the British caricatured him as such. They eventually won the war, so their version of events became more popularized. This is also where the ""Napoleon complex"" term comes in, the idea that someone short overcompensates by being more aggressive.

2) Measurements difference. Back in those days, measurements were not standard worldwide, so a French inch was longer than a British inch, which meant that Napoleon was listed as 5'2"" in French inches, which was about 5'4"" in British inches (and is the equivalent of the modern imperial measurement system). So the British saw 5'2"" and used it for what I spoke for in #1. This would be like someone saying they weigh 150 lbs. and you make fun of them for being fat at 150 kilos.

3) The Garde Impériale. They were Napoleon's personal Guard, akin to a Pretorian Guard, whose main job was to protect the Emperor. They were always next to the Emperor on the battlefield. One of the main requirements for admittance was that they had to be tall, like really tall for the time (5'8"" for cavalry guards, 5'10"" for infantry guards) This would be the equivalent of a 5'10"" man nowadays surrounding himself with 6'5"" bodyguards.

1601,"1. Ethical socialism indeed is socialism not as an economic system, but as a philosophy that is achievable within capitalism itself and serves as the theoretical basis for social democracy - it is closely related also the idea of utopian socialism (as opposed to Marx's scientific socialism), or the idea of liberal socialism (rather than state socialism). A bit about ethical socialism can be read [here](https://www.hillsroad.ac.uk/docs/default-source/summer-word-2020/politics-ideologies.pdf?sfvrsn=2#page=113&amp;zoom=auto,-265,613), in Andrew Heywood's book *Political Ideologies*. They focus on an ethical, or moral, critique of capitalism rather than on an *economic* critique of capitalism, and essentially redefine socialism so it isn't necessarily public/worker ownership over the means of production - rather, they make it broad and values based.

I think you misunderstood slightly what I said - I didn't mean political socialism as in having a dictatorship or something, like China does. I described socialism as specifically a political *ideology*, like conservatism and liberalism are, and they both have both political and economic aspects.

My point is that the economic aspect of ethical socialism is different from the economic aspect of socialism as is generally understood; ethical socialism does not wish to do away with capitalism (which is an economic system, by the way, not an ideology).

Instead, it wishes to humanise capitalism, and wants to see their values embodied in policy that does not necessarily abolish capitalism. So when social democrats expand the welfare state and social safety net, when they're protecting workers' rights and guarantee workers representation, when they're passing policies to combat poverty, ensure free healthcare, childcare, education and so on, when they're redistributing wealth from the wealthier to the poorer, these are the policies that ethical socialists are striving for and are reflected in ethical socialist values. And all of this works within a capitalist system. That's what I meant.

The Nordic countries aren't socialist, that's right. But ethical socialists, such as Anthony Crosland whom I mentioned earlier, from second half of the 20th century, would argue that capitalism, as we truly know it, *has been replaced* thanks to the reforms social democrats, that is ethical socialists, have made. He argued that we do not live in true capitalist economies as they had been known until that point - we now live in *mixed economies*.

You do have private ownership in Sweden of course, but you also have things like worker representation on company boards, you have powerful trade unions, and so on. You also still have public companies in Sweden, and you have cooperatives as well. It's not pure capitalism, it's a mixed economy, and that's what I strive for, and a Nordic-style mixed economy pretty much accomplishes my ideas as an ethical socialist.

The central part of socialism isn't necessarily public ownership; heck, you have ideas like market socialism, which instead seek worker ownership through cooperatives, i.e. a cooperative-based economy, and they retain markets as well. Likewise, socialism is hard to define in general, and throughout history there have been hundreds of different definitions of socialism; some have been extremely narrow, like state ownership over the economy, and others have been as broad as including ""public/worker ownership and **regulation**"", which might or might not be way too broad.

I call myself a socialist because socialist values are those I strive for, but they can be achieved in different ways, and I do not believe that there is necessarily only one way to achieving it. I am a socialist because I genuinely believe in its ideals, which to me represents a more fair society with true liberty for everyone, and I consider myself a socialist who wants to adapt it to the circumstances of today and what we have learned so far; I adhere to the philosophy of ethical socialism, and, for me personally, to me it is also a repudiation of the ""state ownership over the means of production"" conception of socialism.

Also note that socialism predates thinkers such as Marx and Engels, and that the idea of socialism as public ownership isn't the original conception of socialism; or, rather, from the very beginning there were many different ideas of what it would be like, starting with Robert Owen's utopian socialism in the beginning of the 19th century, for instance, revolving around worker cooperatives and communities.

As I said, ethical socialism is to be separated from the concept of socialism as state ownership of the means of production - the second one is specifically a different economic system and yes, can't be had at the same time as capitalism. Ethical socialism however, as a term, simply refers to those values that serve as the bedrock of social democracy and that we as social democrats strive for when we're passing the policies that we do. It doesn't necessarily contradict capitalism, unless we're talking about capitalism in its pure form, complete free market capitalism - and again, nearly no place on Earth has that kind of capitalism and nearly all have mixed economies.

I think we as socialists do stand for getting rid of class boundaries as much as possible, yes. That is done through decent redistribution of wealth as well as ensuring workers have strong labour unions as well as a say in how their companies are run. I don't think we can completely get rid of class but I believe we can minimise its relevance quite, quite a lot.

I understand what you said with regards to Sweden's culture and collectivism vs individualism. As I said, I don't think collectivism and individualism stand opposed to each other, and I think that they should be combined, and your country perfectly reflects that. You said your country can be described as political socialist and the culture is liberal - that's kind of it, that's a good combination. And it is precisely *why* I advocate what I advocate for. I think you can't do just individualism; you can't have everybody being all free, like Americans do, but not have any solidarity. Likewise, you can't have strong solidarity and people tied to each other, while depriving them of all freedom in both political and personal life, in society and culture. You need combining both, and what you described to me with Sweden is precisely that - even though yes, I understand, your culture in general is individualistic. But you worked it out well in spite of that.

Also, as I said, ensuring liberty, justice, and so on are also things essentially all ideologies strive for, in their own way or with different interpretations. Liberals will focus a lot on the idea of liberty, but I think that both those on the democratic left and conservatives too will be for liberty. Conservatives will talk about community, but socialists talk about community all the time too.

Advocates of all those ideologies do talk about the values they advocate. Obviously you don't hear the parties though talking about them quite all the time because they, as political parties trying to win elections, have to propose actual policies, enact actual policies, rather than just philosophise about family values, or tradition, or solidarity, or liberty and so on.

""The road to a collectivistic society ends up fascism"" is very much a slippery slope, especially when I precisely *don't* argue for a collectivist society but rather one involving a mixture of both. You can say in the same way that a party emphasising individualism and its values is one that advocates complete alienation of everybody from each other and absolutely no compassion and solidarity for those less fortunate whatsoever, but that in my opinion would be a slippery slope; liberals will emphasise individualism, but that doesn't mean they will abandon some ideas of collectivism as well (social liberals, at least, don't, for example).

To me, yes, the collectivist values must be emphasised, but 1) that doesn't mean getting rid of individualist values and only going 100% for collectivism, 2) I believe collectivism and individualism both compliment each other and both are vital to each other. Contrary to what Thatcher argued, there is such a thing as a society, and people are better off working together and standing up for each other, caring about one another, than only caring about themselves. And that is important, in my view, to achieving true individualism too; only if we stand together and work together can we achieve true individualism in the sense that we *all* have freedom of expression, freedom to be who we want to be, and so on. 

If we have 100% individualism and 0% collectivism, then we have a society in which those less fortunate wouldn't be able to actually *enjoy* their individual rights, because they live in poverty and there is nobody to help them out, no person or government. If we are 0% individualist but 100% collectivist, then we have strong solidarity and everybody is protected, but we don't have our basic freedoms that I believe are the point of solidarity in the first place; the point is to stand with each other and to guarantee everybody a fair shot at enjoying their liberty. 

Therefore, balance must be ensured, around a 50-50 balance. Some will emphasise individualism more (like liberals/social liberals), and some will emphasise collectivism more (like socialists and Labour's Clause IV), but ultimately they must not disrupt the balance, and neither do. The values outlined the Clause IV do not disrupt that balance, but rather emphasise the importance of solidarity and standing together as a society.

I agree. And that's precisely why what Eduard Bernstein said, that I mentioned earlier in the comment chain, comes into play: it's not the end goal that is the most important, it is the *movement* towards it that really matters.

1642,"&gt; No, again, my sources are from Western world. 

You gave no source that supports your argument. You just repeat the Turkish propaganda to excuse the Turkish actions. No country in the world apart from Turkey recognizes the illegal state that the Turks setup on the ethnically cleansed land their army occupies, and yet you called this part of Cyprus as a ""nation"" like Scotland. That is not the view of the Western world, but a Turkish view. So stop trying to hide.

 

&gt; If you insist we can call it as ethnic cleanising. But take in mind that it was Greek PM Venizelos who asked and AGREED for this. And again it is not related to what we discussed. I always notice some unrelated stuff coming out of the sky when you lack arguments. For division of Cyprus at that time even more humane conditions could be used. And fact is that division was in the constitution of Republic of Cyprus - the separate municipalities and again, who wanted to clean their ass with the constitution? How is messing with agreed terms and conditions of another community while trying to take away their rights sound democratic to you? 

Venizelos agreed because those people would have been all killed by the Turks if they stayed in Anatolia. 

Don't confuse a constitution with democracy. South Africa during apartheid also had a constitution, one which was not democratic and discriminated against the majority of the population. The democratic thing to do with such racist constitutions is to reform them, and make them democratic. 

As I said earlier, in Cyprus a racist constitution was imposed, which discriminated against the majority. The only reason we agreed to it was that people were being killed and Turkey was threatening us with ethnic cleansing. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Well, Scottish nationalist aren't oppresed, even opposite - they form the Scottish government! It is not what Tyranny of majority is. At least not in the Democratic World. 

And Greece wouldn't oppress Cypriots either. Rhodes united with Greece in 1947. Is Rhodes oppressed? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; You mean Grivas, Sampson and others killing Turks for no reason was the way how Greeks ""have no problem""? Yeah, when you kill everyone there is no problem left. And also I believe you didn't know about the infamous ""Akritas organization"" with the goal of eliminating Turks, firstly from government, then from the island? 

And the Turks had people like Denktash and his TMT organization which was killing Greek Cypriots for no reason. All this were part of the conflict which Turkish Cypriots started in 1958. And unlike the many genocides which the Turks committed, Greek Cypriots never ""kill everyone"". Crimes were committed by both sides in that conflict, but you keep ignoring the fact that Turkish Cypriot started it. 

As far as Akritas plan goes, I read it, and there is absolutely nothing in it about ""eliminating Turks"". Akritas plan was about achieving enosis, something which at the time had the support of the majority of the population, and not about ""eliminating Turks"". And that plan was never implemented, as opposed to the Turkish plans for partition.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Not true at all. Never ever it was agreed on such conditions, neither in Cyprus constitution nor Annan plan. 

It was not agreed because we don't agree to it. But this is what the Turks demand. Veto power on everything for their 18% minority. 

Would Turkey give veto power on everything that happens in Turkey to the Kurds? They don't even let them speak their language in the parliament, and jail their leaders. The 18% Kurdish community in Turkey has 0% power share, but for their 18%  community in Cyprus they demand 50% power share.",Cyprus,/r/europe/comments/n2mqoe/on_this_day_in_2004_cyprus_became_a_full_member/gx3e82g/,Ozyzen,1620260765

1657,"And that's exactly why I support ethical socialism and why I believe that my idea of socialism should be relegated into the future. Ethical socialism defines socialism in terms of values rather than as state ownership of the means of production; values are timeless, policies are not. Policies depend on the circumstances of the time, the place, development and so on. So we should orient ourselves in the direction of an ethical socialism, defined in ethical terms, and strive in that direction.

I do not think that being fine with private ownership is against the principles of my understanding of socialism. It's all about values, and I do think you can have those values implemented within a capitalist economy in the form of social democratic policy. 

I think, if a societal clash came between collectivism and individualism, and both options are the most extreme versions possible, then I would rather shoot myself than pick an option, because both would have dire consequences. We see the consequences of extreme individualism in the United States. We see the consequences of complete selfishness, disregard, caring only about yourself, egoism. Likewise, we saw the consequences of extreme collectivism in countries like the USSR; the people are essentially enslaved, have no freedoms, no free space, may not express themselves, their basic rights are suppressed. 

Today, you have even more extreme individualists than Americans in the form of anarcho-capitalists. Their ideal society would essentially lead to the starvation of millions upon millions, incredible poverty, alienation, destruction of human society, community as we know it. 

Picking between absolute individualism and absolute collectivism is a terrible choice. I'm not sure what I would pick. Though, yes, I would say that I would agree with the Benjamin Franklin quote: ""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."" I would agree with that. But again, there shouldn't have to be such a tradeoff. 

Socialism and communism are both scarcely understood terms and their definitions significantly evolved over the centuries. Communism is a stateless, classless, moneyless society, while socialism, as it is generally understood and in the classical definition, is an economy with public/worker ownership of the means of production.

Marxists view capitalism and socialism as the two stages before the achievement of communism. Essentially the phases in the development of communism according to Marx are slaveholder society, to feudalist society, to capitalist society, to ""dictatorship (rule) of the proletariat"" after that and a socialist society, to communist society. He predicted that capitalism was doomed to end, just as feudalism had ended for instance, and that it was bound to be replaced by the rule of the proletariat which would act as a transitionary period towards communism.

At the moment, China would consider itself to be in that transitionary phase. They are socialists who consider themselves to be **working towards** communism. China isn't a communist country - that's an oxymoron, as communism is stateless, classless and moneyless. Communism is the final stage once that transitionary phase I mentioned earlier, the rule of the proletariat, is completed.

Essentially, the Chinese theory, from Deng Xiaoping onwards, is that they skipped the capitalist phase, and that's where the mistake was; China didn't yet go through all the phases as envisioned by Marx. It had gone straight from a feudalist society to socialism, skipping capitalism. What Deng then did, with that in mind, was revert China back one level, to capitalism, and implement market-oriented reforms. This is viewed by them as the capitalist stage of the eventual development of communism.

As for my opinion - communism is supposed to be a classless, stateless, moneyless society, but as you can see, the Chinese communists, and communists overall, behave in a way completely opposite of that claim. They impose the most totalitarian dictatorships imaginable, and then say that it's paving the way to communism. You can't do that - that's not how you pave the way to a stateless society. Giving power to the state and implementing a dictatorship won't pave the way towards the elimination of that state; rather, the power will further concentrate in its hands.

Anyway, with regards to communism, it is collectivism at its most extreme, like anarcho-capitalism would be individualism at its most extreme. But I'm not a communist. Additionally, that was socialism as Marx viewed it - but the idea of socialism predates Marx and it doesn't necessitate establishing a communist society. There are different forms of socialism, and Marx's would be described as ""scientific socialism"" (because he believed that was how things would objectively be, scientifically how they would be) and the kind I refer to would be described as ""utopian socialism"". All these labels are probably confusing you at this point, I know. My point is that it's not the same kind of socialism, like how Christian democracy isn't the same as US style libertarian conservatism.

Anyway, I agree with your last paragraph. I too am more oriented in the direction of class than of race, and I believe it's a more important factor (although certainly not the *only* one). I appreciate this talk with you and it is pretty enjoyable and nice to hear your thoughts on this, and to have such a thorough discussion on it. I believe what's most important is that we stand by our convictions and also respect others' - that we respect their viewpoints and that we don't force everybody to think our way. We all have our own ideas, values, what we believe is best for society, and I don't think any of us, unless we're fascists worshipping Hitler or far-leftists worshipping Stalin, are really evil.

There is simply not enough evidence of Stalin pursuing the destruction of any given ethnic group. 

Famines in both Ukraine and Kazakhstan were part of a broader food crisis that enveloped many regions of the Soviet Union, not just those two

&gt; The main and by far the biggest reason of 1932-1933 was a desire to eradicate any nationality that has shown resistance. Saying it was a ""multitude of factors"" is the same as saying shit like American Civil Was was fought for a ""multitude of factors"".

Your comparison is stupid. Historians have clearly reached a consensus to why American civil war was fought.

There is no  consensus among historians saying Stalin and USSR wanted to exterminate nationalities that showed resistance.

1771,"\&gt; There is simply not enough evidence of Stalin pursuing the destruction of any given ethnic group. 

This is factually not true. I mean, Crimean Tatars come to mind. 

\&gt; Famines in both Ukraine and Kazakhstan were part of a broader food crisis that enveloped many regions of the Soviet Union, not just those two 

The degree was vastly different.  

\&gt; The fact that historians still debate this is proof you can't just blatantly say the famine was a man made genocide. 

It's not so hard to find that people are still technically debating the causes of American Civil War. Or what is now happening in China. The fact that debate is ongoing does not mean ""well, no side is technically correct yet"". Holodomor was a man made genocide as recongnized by the overwealming majority of historians with any shred of credability. This is not a debate at this point. The debate can be about how it was done, what those who perpetrated tried to achive and so on. But the actual fact of it happening is proven well beyond reasonable doubt. 

\&gt; It clearly wasn't black and white as you're portraying it.

He has a banned party on his heels so the strong man act has to come out, he has made claims; which we feel outrageous and rather silly in a way, then

“When 50 Muslim countries will unite and say this, and say that if  something like this happens in any country, then we will launch a trade  boycott on them and not buy their goods, that will have an effect.”

Do you see a likelihood of this, and a trade boycott would be a two way street that is going to hurt smaller Muslim countries way more.

So the EU Parliament goes all righteous and actually puts something into writing which none of the member nations have done. They have also pushed the issue to other EU institutions: ""The resolution also calls upon the European Commission and European  External Action Service to review Pakistan’s GSP+ status, a status which  waives tariffs on European Union imports from Pakistan."" for potential further action.

Imran's inetrnal rioting may get bigger, but he will have deflected the problem onto the bullying EU and then there is the potential of violence against all Europeans in Pakistan not only the French.

Also, is this within the EU competency, because this is foreign policy without working through the ramifications.

How has their been zero substance behind it, it was substantive enough for Varadkar to consider a commemoration for it.

2061,"&gt;Correct, they also *overlap* which is what I have been saying.

You can't identify as an ethnicity. There's a serious problem with you defining a two-tier concept of Britishness and then telling people that aren't ethnically British that they are only *politically* British. 

&gt;No it's not, Britishness was promoted by King James Ist, a Scottish monarch who united the thrones, long before Scotland and England were unified and long before the 19th century.

Fine, it started in the 18th century, but ['the notion of Britishness and a shared British identity was forged during the 18th century and early 19th century'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people) which puts in squarely into the high imperial era, ""what do they know of England, who only England know?” and all that.

&gt;No it isn't.

That's not my first response to you - [this is](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/n4i38b/joseph_plunkett_married_grace_gifford_in/gww56ff?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

&gt;They've been British citizens, but they're not ethnically British as Ireland is distinct from the island of Great Britain, or are you going to disagree on this basic tenet?

Apart from the fact that [British Citizenship came about in 1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1981), neither of my grandparents consented to be British subjects, even though they were born under occupation. They were neither ethnically British nor did they accept a British identity. So, no I would say that they were not British.

&gt;Then Irish people don't exist.

That is correct - presented with a corpse, you'd have no way of objectively establishing what nationality they were. Nationality is just an identity. Equally, presented with a corpse, you'd have no way of establishing if it was of British ancestry - there's no British DNA, or rather there are many kind of British DNA.

&gt;With foreign policy, Canada couldn't even issue its own ambassadors until the 1930's and its foreign policy was permanently aligned with UK interests. Dominion status was a status of semi independence and permanent alignment with the UK.

 Have you tried telling a Canadian that their '*status was a status of semi independence and permanent alignment with the UK'*? I don't think they'd like that. On the whole, it sounds like Irish independence is superior to home rule or dominion status then.

&gt;They're not at risk, you're being hyperbolic.

The actual explanation which Turks and Azeris refuse to believe as fact, is that an old cache of obsolete soviet union license plates was found and instead of being thrown away it was used to make something. 

The odds of two 4-digit license plates being sequential is 1/8000 maybe, taking into account that not every 4 digit combination is used. Now the odds of that happening with multiple license plates with several sequential numbers is next to impossible to accomplish in the aftermath of a 4 year war.

This doesn't even factor in ageing population (and this already is a major factor with COVID - very simple calculations (so this will be only a rough estimate) - multiplying number of people in certain age group with percent of people in this age group who died due to COVID - show Slovenian population is twice as vulnerable as it was in 2000 and it will be 2/3 more vulnerable than now in 2040.

Searched for Fyrklövern Sweden but results were only plates.

As currently is just in the planning phase, yes is understandable that layout is not available yet.

Nice to hear that storage is included in the purchase and is not sold as a separate unit, is a good thing, and yes, storage areas are not big, somewhere between 2 to 6 square meters, depends on the size of the apartment as well. Usually bigger apartments have possibility to buy bigger storage area, which translate in the cost of the purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

Upplands Väsby, Sweden, 25km away from Stockholms Centralstation, 3500 euro per square meter, sounds the same as here (Prague). If is reasonable or not, depends on the income.

I perfectly can.

&gt; Sure it's not all right. But its not he first time this happens... turkish/azerbaijanis done that for more than 150 years now, so its not wrong to say its in their culture to destroy other cultures and later denying it.

Debatable.

&gt; Therefore I have a much higher tolerance for armenian comments than for turkish/azerbaijanis.

So we should stoop down to their level too ? I am not convinced of that.

Especially since a lot of those comments are not made out of a sense of empathy or actual wish to defend Armenians but simply yet another opportunity to disguise pure and simple racism.

I am pretty sure that for a lot of those comments, if you presented them and Armenian and a Turk they wouldn't be able to tell the difference. 

That's the key here, hiding under false pretenses to simply be a racist shitbag.

You can question and rightly point out the continued genocide attempts upon the Armenians, because yes what they are doing still classifies as genocide, without falling into the trap of hate which only serves to fuel trolls the likes of which you can see all The_Donald esque subbredits which are still unbanned for whatever reason (/r/muslim is a prime example).",,/r/europe/comments/n57ucy/armenian_cemetery_in_azerbaijanioccupied_mets/gx05tnx/,warpbeast,1620202474

2447,"&gt;Do you see it where you said ""British identity"" and then ""other ethnic groups""? where you conflated ""identity"" and ""ethnic""? or then where you said ""ethnic identity""? They're the places where you conflated ""identity"" and ""ethnicity"", two completely orthogonal concepts.

Nope, because British identity primarily consists of as I've stated, English Welsh Scottish and Cornish ethnic identities as they are indigenious to the island of Great Britain, there's an overlap with 

&gt;You might not be aware of this, but ""Celtic"" is a loose term to describe similar artifacts from an early historic period. ""The relationship between ethnicity, language and culture in the Celtic world is unclear and controversial. In particular, there is dispute over the ways in which the Iron Age inhabitants of Britain and Ireland should be regarded as Celts.""

You mean they overlap like British heritage does between ethnicity and identity? Colour me shocked!

&gt;""Irish"" is an identity. There are various ahistoric interpretations of Irishness but we're not really that fussy (read 'not racists').

""British"" Is an identity. There are various ahistoric interpretations of Britishness but we're really not that fussy (read 'not racists')

&gt;This is what I meant by ""The clever part is that no scientific criteria exist for proving British ethnicity, so the outgroup can be changed to suit the prevailing climate and create fear through instability"". The Cornish are British now but sorry Isle of Man, you only have a British identity.

The basic criteria is to live on the island of Great Britain, the Isle of Man are a distinct self governing ethnicity from the British mainland. It's also why the official title of the UK is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

&gt;Well it does diminish their Britishness if they're not 'foundation' British. 

Nope

&gt;Also, what constitutes English ethnicity? Part Germanic Angle, Saxon, part French-speaking Norman with a bit of Irish heritage? Doesn't sound very foundational.

2499,"You're confusing social gender with biological sex. Yes, male and female are biologically defined by their role in reproduction and how this manifests in genitals, yes. But man and woman on a social context, including ID documents, are not about genitals as genitals are never a big part of social interactions. Government issued IDs are not a biological or genetic study.

&gt;No one can be identified by their gender, because there are millions of people of the same gender. If the person needs to be identified, then for example a photo is needed. For statistical purposes, genitals do matter.

Think about a police warning of a suspect. One of the first things they will say about the suspect is the gender. True that a picture is needed for full identification, but gender is part of the process. Imagine you present like a woman, society reads you as woman, you want to be seen as woman, but your ID says male - what would be the implications in terms of passport control or even getting into a pub that requires your ID? As you might guess it creates a lot of [problems](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/tsa-body-scanners-transgender-travelers/index.html) for trans people when the gender in the ID does not math the visible gender.

For statistical purposes, what matters is how society treats you. Again if I look like a woman and present as a woman I am treated like a woman, doesn't matter if I have a penis or not because people can't see my penis. My work colleagues will treat me as a woman, individuals targeting women for violent behavior will also target me, because again nobody can see my genitals in the day-to-day activities. Having male in my ID and for all legal statistics will be misleading. 

&gt;If the two people have the required genitals to have children, then they can have children.

Then why are we trying to force a trans woman to change her birth genitals before she can be legally recognized as a woman?",,/r/europe/comments/n4mwvk/a_snapshot_of_transgender_rights_progress_in/gx06kgk/,ENGTA01,1620203161

The Battle of Kohima (together with the intertwined Battle of Imphal) proved the turning point of the Japanese U-Go offensive into India in 1944 during the Second World War.

The Japanese defeat at Kohima and Imphal by the British Empire directly stopped the Imperial Japanese war aims of subjugation of the British Raj, becoming the most vital series of battles in the road to victory for Burma, China, and India.

Granting candidate status and entering all these talks and stuff, while at the same time national leaders would just say No - that's bad from whatever angle you look at it. This is making it so much harder for the forces in candidate countries who really want change.

I remember when Erdogan was just elected and joining the EU was his one big issue afaik. He was all over the media here. This guy went into a 3-way interview at some hardly known program of the Franco-German culture channel with a market share of 5% at best (the channel, not even the program!), just to beat the drum for membership and flash his European credentials. The way he talked and pleaded it sounded almost like begging - I was a little impressed by that. Ofc he was likely putting on a show, but still. Can't blame him for not talking the talk back then. If the EU had been serious and promised Turkey it can join when all criteria are met, maybe history had gone a slightly different way. Not that Erdogan had lost all those traits that gradually turned him into an authoritarian ruler, but it would've been much more difficult for him within the corset of ever closer alignment with the EU.",Hamburg (Germany),/r/europe/comments/n4j1fm/member_states_of_the_eu_efta_european_free_trade/gwzndfs/,Temporary_Meat_7792,1620188387

2622,"Egypt opposed the dam because Britain gave them a piece of paper in 1929 claiming they have veto power over upstream British colonies (Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya).

&amp;#x200B;

Ethiopia reminded Egypt they weren't a colony ever or of Britain so that did not apply to them.  Those upstream nations except Sudan all signed an agreement called the CFA in the 00s basically creating a new agreement on Nile Sharing.  Egypt and Sudan refused because they viewed it as nullifying their 1929 document and 1959 bilateral agreement on how to split the water, where the 2 last countries of 11 to get the water agreed to themselves they'd get 100% of the water ignoring the 9 upstream nations.  Egypt then switched their argument to we will die if anyone touches the Nile.

&amp;#x200B;

Upstream nations paid really fancy foreign firms to conduct water studies, which showed this to be untrue.  The firms pointed out that Rosiers dam in sudan has a 4 year water supply, sudan also gets water from the white nile which comes from outside Ethiopia.Egypt has a 10 year water supply behind the Aswan in the worlds 6 largest man made lake/reservoir called Lake Nasser. Which is about 3 times the size of Lake Tana, Ethiopia's fresh water source.

&amp;#x200B;

Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan now agree on 90% of the points dealing with the dam including a 7 year fill timeline of which we are into the 2nd year.  Sudan's issue are mainly safety and information sharing, fair enough.  Egypt's issue is 1, water sharing agreement; 2, water sharing in  drought ;  3, written agreement for filling and operation.

With Egypt wanting a water sharing agreement saying Ethiopia gets zero, and must send them water in a drought even if ethiopians are dying of thirst and that this must be in written agreement.  Further they want a written agreement which would essentially put Egypt in charge of the GERD which obviously Ethiopia would never agree to because you know, sovereignty and all that.",,/r/europe/comments/n4idq5/france_to_sell_30_rafale_fighter_jets_to_egypt_in/gwzns06/,White_Mlungu_Capital,1620188633

2678,"The Battle of Castle Itter was fought in the Austrian North Tyrol village of Itter on 5 May 1945, in the last days of World War II in Europe. 

Troops of the 23rd Tank Battalion of the 12th Armored Division of the US XXI Corps led by Captain John C. ""Jack"" Lee, Jr., a number of Wehrmacht soldiers led by Major Josef ""Sepp"" Gangl, SS-Hauptsturmführer Kurt Siegfried Schrader, and recently freed French prisoners of war defended Castle Itter (where elite French political figures were being held prisoner by the Nazis) against an attacking force from the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division until relief from the American 142nd Infantry Regiment of the 36th Division of XXI Corps arrived.

Castle Itter (German: Schloss Itter) in the Austrian Alps existed as a fortress since at least the 13th century and was rebuilt in 1532. It was renovated in 1878 and became a hotel early in the 20th century. In 1940, after the Anschluss brought Austria into the Third Reich, the castle was rented out to the German government. In 1943 it came under the administrative control of Dachau, a concentration camp about 90 miles (145 km) away, and was made into a special SS detention facility for prisoners who had potential value as hostages.

The French prisoners included former prime ministers, generals and a tennis star, as well as General de Gaulle's sister.

2813,"Wow! That reminds me of a story shared to my high school history class by our teacher. 

When he was a teenager, he was in Amsterdam with his parents for a family vacation and they were apparently at a rather swanky restaurant. As he told it, the owner/manager happened to be in that night, and making his casual rounds to see if things were well with his customers, he learned that they were visiting from Canada. Later, when they asked for their bill, they didn't get one, and apparently the owner had come to them saying ""No, please,"" waving them off while stating ""You're Canadian; your money is no good here."" This must've been in the early 80s or so -- 40 years later and that man had remembered how grateful he and his country were to those from Canada, and clearly he felt that was the least he could do to thank them.

Ironically, my teacher's father was Austrian and IIRC had several family members who had been dedicated members of the Nazi Party, including one old great uncle who would still say things at family gatherings like ""You know, that Hitler fellow really wasn't such a bad guy..."" I always thought that little detail was funny, given how the restaurateur had no idea.

2816,"&gt;  The entire idea behind Chinese investment by the US was to break them apart

No?

&gt; We've been anti-China for a while.

No?

Are you trying to retroactively change the motivations?

The reason for the massive investments into China was cheap labour and the huge gains that were made. Combined with the idea that a stable consumer-based economy will strengthen democracy and that an interconnected economy will create bonds and prevent wars. All this was a prevailing ideology until very recently and even the Trump's attempts to move manufacturing back to US were painted as stupid nationalistic attempts that will endanger peace as they go against working globalistic ideology.

Your idea that the investment into China was to ""break them apart"" frankly lack any sensible logic and sounds like something you just made up. This as well as that US have been anti-China for a while given the close economic collaboration (through transfer of production into China and growing trade deficit), stuff that started changing just recently as China is feeling powerful enough to apply its economic muscles not just in their region, but globally.",Czech Republic / New Zealand,/r/europe/comments/n4mt5p/china_tensions_spill_over_as_europe_moves_toward/gwyupym/,Unicorn_Colombo,1620173787

&gt;No it wasn't, your original point was uprisings happened when the UK was distracted, it wasn't during the Fenian uprising.

What you have written doesn't make any sense. I never mentioned a Fenian Uprising at all - do you mean the one in Canada? Even allowing for the late hour, this is disassociated rambling.

&gt;You're just proving my point, thank you, yes, power was devolved by Westminster to the Dominion states peacefully

Your point was that Canada, New Zealand and Australia got Home Rule. Your new position is just as fatuous, Canada had at least two open rebellions.

&gt;Permanence of the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government ... cut and paste legalese

Sounds lovely but as the UK has no constitutional protection, Westminister can unilaterally overturn that act. In fact, the government can and does renege on any legislation it likes.

&gt;The argument is that the poverty isn't directed towards people because they're Scottish, but because of a neo-liberal economic experiment.

It's not a 'neo-liberal economic experiment', you don't live in America. It's the natural decline of a former imperial power, now preying on its own subjects.

&gt;I'd call your take delusional.

Or maybe factual, since the Northern executive [was indeed collapsed by Westminister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunningdale_Agreement) and Scotland did take [nearly a hundred years to get their papier mache parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_rule#Scotland). Not that the distinction between fact and delusion means much to someone who lives by their own unsupported assumptions.

&gt;Yeah, whilst I don't doubt economic issues have contributed to it, I highly doubt its the UK's fault for Scotlands eating habits and drinking culture

More casual racism directed at the inferior sort of Brit; the Scots are more than politically British (unlike the Ulster Unionists or the Manx) but less than truly *English* British.

&gt;You're trying to school me on constitutional arrangements whilst confidently asserting Westminster can just close down Scottish parliament.

Boris has openly suggested that Scottish devolution was a mistake that needs to be rescinded. In the real world, if you don't control taxation or policy, then whoever does can shut you down. No matter what nice act they wrote for you.

&gt;lol, here's a suggestion, you're not as smart as you think you are.

I don't think I'm really going to have to worry about your opinion. And if I didn't like it, I'd just have to wait fifteen minutes for the next one. If you could remember the point you were trying to make in the first place. Something about Fenians?

2891,"That makes more sense. But that is how everyone thought that the world works after WW2, during the cold war and especially after the fall of the Soviet Union, which showed that Communism does not work and capitalism and capitalistic democracy is superior. The prevailing paradigm about development and stability.

The idea was that countries cannot be rich and stable if they are not capitalistic democracies (given that only democracies can be capitalistic and thus capitalism leads to democracy) or have oil, in which case the stability last as long as their oil capacities and they are not that stable anyway (especially if USA or Soviets help nudge them into the right direction).

But that wan't anti-CCP, but just an ""understanding"" how world ticket and that through investment, western ideas of democracy, progress etc. will emerge, as if this was some sort of Civilization game with tech/cultural tree where you deterministically progress from one stage to another. So to point investments into the Chinese economy as ""anti-China"" just misses the point as this wasn't viewed as such through this commonly accepted ideological background.

But recently, China showed that this isn't the case and you can have quite a dystopic dictatorship and still be a rich and powerful country. Which motivate other countries to follow their way, instead of struggling to adopt a capitalistic democracy through adopting western ideas and culture.

But slowly, as Western countries are losing their political and economical position, they are beginning to realize that in some ways, global economy *might be* a zero-sum game, especially if some players do not play according to assumed globalistic rules, and a more nationalistic practices are becoming more common. This was after all partly the reason how Trump got elected.

Just look at the relationship of EU with Russia and China. EU used to happily trade with both, but slowly EU countries are starting to realize that the globalistic ideology just doesn't work and starting to adopt a some sort of nationalism, either of nation-states (but this is heavily criticized) or, in other cases, euronationalism.",Czech Republic / New Zealand,/r/europe/comments/n4mt5p/china_tensions_spill_over_as_europe_moves_toward/gwyxkgs/,Unicorn_Colombo,1620175145

In truth, the architects of apartheid wanted a compliant, cheap, and poorly educated black labour workforce to toil in the mines, as maids and gardeners, and so on. 

They did this by making the separate ‘homelands’ economically non-viable and forcing a migrant labour system that saw black people having to travel long distances to work while having supposed homes in places where no real work was ever possible. They also, through Bantu Education, steadily dumbed down education for black African children with the stated purpose of keeping them as labourers. 

Apartheid was more than just a continuation of the country’s segregationist policies of the previous few hundred years, but was substantially different, harsher, crueler, and based on a totalitarian social engineering plan to ensure white domination over blacks for generations.

2966,"&gt;Nicola Sturgeon has dismissed accusations that she will seek to hold an “illegal, wildcat referendum” in the event Boris Johnson blocks a second independence poll.  
&gt;  
&gt;The first minister said she would “not countenance an illegal referendum” in the next Scottish Parliament, even if Westminster declined to grant a section 30 order.  
&gt;  
&gt;The comments appeared to contradict earlier remarks from the first minister, who told broadcasters that Mr Johnson would “would have to take legal action” to stop her indyref2 plans.  
&gt;  
&gt;With polls predicting a narrow SNP majority at Thursday’s election, the Scottish Tories used Tuesday night’s BBC leaders’ debate to warn voters over Ms Sturgeon’s constitutional promises.

&gt;  
&gt;With polls predicting a narrow SNP majority at Thursday’s election, the Scottish Tories used Tuesday night’s BBC leaders’ debate to warn voters over Ms Sturgeon’s constitutional promises.  
&gt;  
&gt;Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie also said he wanted to focus on recovery, adding: “The people who are waiting an age for mental health treatment I think deserve better than this, the people who are desperate for a job deserve better than this.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Early on in the debate their was consensus over Covid-19 and the caution needed with allowing international travel, but leaders clashed over the future of care in Scotland.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ms Sturgeon, along with Mr Sarwar, supported the idea of a national care service going forward.  
&gt;  
&gt;The first minister said Scotland should be “bold about the legacy we want for future generations” as she backed the ambition of a national care service.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Ross however said the idea “demeans and undermines” the contribution of private care providers during the pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;All the leaders were later in agreement that a new royal yacht should not be paid for by public money.  
&gt;  
&gt;Reports in recent days have suggested the vessel could cost as much as £200 million, but Ms Sturgeon has said it would be no more than a distraction.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The only reason Boris Johnson has been talking about this is to distract attention from the sleaze that is swirling around him and his government – everyone should see through it,” she said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie described the idea as an “absurdity”, while Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said: “I could think of probably 500 other things I would rather spend that money on.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Sarwar described the move as a “cheap stunt”, but Mr Ross said he believed the vessel would be paid for by private investment, adding public money should “absolutely not” be used to fund the project.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/n504xw/nicola_sturgeon_denies_claims_she_will_hold/gwygskl/,libtin,1620167169

They could but most countries tax a company's profits not their revenue. 

Large international companies can reduce their profits in a country and at the same time move revenue abroad by paying for the leasing of intellectual properties. So Amazon the legal entity in the UK pays the legal entity in Luxemburg to use the name 'Amazon' which reduces their revenue in the UK but increases the profits in Luxemburg where they pay less tax.

In some cases they also avoid paying tax on worker's wages by keeping the worker's pay and hours under a certain level (e.g. hiring 2 workers on 15 hour per week contracts rather than 1 worker on 30 hours per week).

Countries could tax these companies a percentage of their revenue over a certain amount (e.g £1 million or £10 million) rather than just taxing their profits which would stop this happening.",,/r/europe/comments/n4wj5w/how_do_companies_pay_no_tax/gwxyqev/,FrivolouslyFanciful,1620159395

3045,"&gt;At least you're reading some of the links. I'm not sure what points you're trying to make though;

Yes you are, stop playing dumb thanks. 

&gt;The original point was that the successful uprising was when England was distracted.

No it wasn't, your original point was uprisings happened when the UK was distracted, it wasn't during the Fenian uprising. 

""All the uprisings were at an inconvenient time for Britain, this one was more successful.""

&gt;Is the argument that pretty much all regions of the UK are impoverished at the expense of London and the Home Counties? I'm inclined to agree with you on that one. Glad to see the situation improve in Scotland, sorry to see austerity bite elsewhere.

Stop pretending to empathise. The argument is that the poverty isn't directed towards people because they're Scottish, but because of a neo-liberal economic experiment. 

&gt;Canada did not get Home Rule; Australia, Canada and New Zealand were too far outside Britain's sphere of influence and, following the loss of the United States, were able to acquire dominion status. Considerably better than Home Rule, it involves a constitution that cannot be abrogated by Westminister.

You're just proving my point, thank you, yes, power was devolved by Westminster to the Dominion states peacefully. 

&gt;They didn't even get the basic devolved powers until 1999 and even then the existence of Holyrood is at Westminister's discretion. 

[Wrong](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/11/section/1/enacted)

Permanence of the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government
63APermanence of the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government

(1)The Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government are a permanent part of the United Kingdom’s constitutional arrangements.

(2)The purpose of this section is, with due regard to the other provisions of this Act, to signify the commitment of the Parliament and Government of the United Kingdom to the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government.

(3)In view of that commitment it is declared that the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government are not to be abolished except on the basis of a decision of the people of Scotland voting in a referendum.”

&gt;Maybe they'll collapse it like they did the Northern Ireland Parliament. If I was a Scot expecting self-governance nearly a century ago, I'd call that a shafting.

I'd call your take delusional. 

&gt;Other than being one of the poorest countries in Europe (not even in Europe now), have you seen the life expectency figures for Scotland? The fact that the much of the rest of the UK is as bad or worse doesn't take away from the precipitous economic decline that Scotland is experiencing.

Yeah, whilst I don't doubt economic issues have contributed to it, I highly doubt its the UK's fault for Scotlands eating habits and drinking culture. 

&gt;Just don't reply again asserting that Canada, Australia or New Zealand 'got home rule' and maybe consider reading a modern history of the British Empire; the assertions aren't as wild as you might think.

- you set up a “purchasing company” on a country which allows for a very low tax rate for “intellectual property” revenues. E.g. The Netherlands.
- then, your factories sell all the manufactured products to that company, and also pay royalties for the usage of the “intelectual property” which allows that manufacturing to take place. This ensures NO VAT IS PAID. As the manufacturing costs are made to be equal to the selling cost.
- finally, all profits are declared as intelectual property, which pays minimal corporate taxes. 
- but this is not all. Those countries, and most others, by the way, allow for CAPEX for I&amp;D to be deducted from the final corporate tax. This makes the final real tax rate to be below 10%.

Here is some info to get you caught up.

&gt;The Soviet advance and ultimate capture of the German capital was not opposed by their allies. In an effort to avoid a diplomatic issue, United States Army General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower had ordered his forces into the south of Germany to cut off and wipe out other pieces of the Wehrmacht and to avoid the possibility that the Nazi government would attempt to hold out in a national redoubt in the Alps.

&gt;The western allies left eastern Germany and the city of Berlin to the Red Army. The Yalta Conference had already determined that Germany and Berlin would be divided into four zones of occupation

What are you smoking? Do you have any idea how Slavic languages work? Of course, in Polish you can say ***wziąć ślub*** which means to marry someone, but literally everyone says either ***ożenić się*** (""to marry a woman"", used by men) or ***wyjść za mąż*** (""to marry a man"", used by women).

If there's a family celebration of some sort and you're single, you're asked either *Kiedy wyjdziesz za mąż?* (if you're a girl) or *Kiedy się ożenisz?* (if you're a guy). Nobody says something like *Kiedy weźmiesz ślub?* because it sounds weird. And the act of marrying a woman by a man is called ***ożenek*** while the act of marrying a man by a woman is called ***zamążpójście***.

There are some types of gender reassignment surgery (vaginoplasty) that have better results if orchiectomy is not performed, since the surgeon will use the skin of the scrotum to build the neovagina and the scrotum can shrink without the testicles. They could also be lesbians and want to have the possibility of having children with their wives (freezing sperm can be very expensive), although that is likely to not happen anyway if you're on hormones for a long time. Also some transwomen think that the risks and costs of submitting yourself to a surgery table to remove an organ that can be easily hidden in 99% of your social interactions is not worth taking, even if they would prefer of course to not have testicles.",,/r/europe/comments/n4mwvk/a_snapshot_of_transgender_rights_progress_in/gwx98fq/,ENGTA01,1620145399

However, I think this is a moot point, because these studies are usually based on a bunch of factors, like GDP, that aren't necessarily related to happiness anyway.

I find it strange that most non-Germans focus on the anti-nuclear energy stance of the Green party, although, because of a lot of things that happened since the 80s, this is an absolute mainstream opinion of the majority of Germans and there is not a single serious party advocating it.  
What isn't put into focus, however, is that with the Green party at the helm of a German government, the whole topic of environmentalism will get a huge boost not only in Germany but in the EU.  So disliking the Greens because of nuclear power is extremely shortsighted.

Personally, I dislike a lot of the Greens party program. At the last election, I read all major programs and in an election decision program (Wahlomat) had a 37% agreement as my highest result for a party. I dislike that party intensely and would never vote for it. At the end of the day I will vote for the lesser evil, which might well be the Green party but that is by no means certain now, I haven't started my voting preparation yet.

You're also purposefully leaving out the fact we were at war with Britain in 1920, you spoon. You can't implement home rule in a country that you're currently at war with.

Also, you're acting like home rule is anything akin to the fully independent republic we are today, saying it would have happened anyway is either ignorance or an intentional delusion of facts.

“There’s been a mood shift,” said Joerg Wuttke, Beijing-based president of the European Chamber of Commerce in China and a board member of the Mercator Institute of China Studies in Berlin, one of the entities sanctioned by China in March.

He cited the “perfect storm” of China’s assertiveness toward Taiwan, its move to impose political control over Hong Kong, and international sanctions over alleged human-rights abuses in the Xinjiang region, overlaid by the fact that China hasn’t followed through on its promises of opening up economically.

To be sure, Europe is not uniform in its outlook, with EU members such as Hungary still eager to engage with China. And whereas Biden has said that China can expect “extreme competition” from the U.S. while it also seeks to work with it on global issues such as climate change, Europe faces more of a dilemma as its strives to forge its own path.

Economic ties remain paramount since China is the EU’s biggest trading partner, with a total volume of some $686 billion in 2020 outstripping U.S.-China trade of $572 billion. Yet now even the Netherlands, which is among China’s top 10 trading partners, is growing more wary, protecting its high-tech companies from takeover and enacting a dedicated China strategy. According to the Chinese official, the U.S. has forced the EU to take sides.

The sentiment was different just four months ago when Merkel helped steer the bloc to seal the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, which Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said was “an important landmark in our relationship with China.” Still subject to ratification by the European Parliament, it would provide improved access to the Chinese market for European investors while committing China to “ambitious principles” including on forced labor.

Yet by late March, the EU had joined the U.S., Canada and the U.K. in imposing sanctions on China over alleged mistreatment of  Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, including forcing them to work. Beijing responded with its own sanctions, while a public backlash saw Swedish fashion retailer Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB subject to an unofficial boycott.",,/r/europe/comments/n4mt5p/china_tensions_spill_over_as_europe_moves_toward/gwwbs7z/,quixotic_cynic,1620130392

“The EU has recently added more agenda items tied with human rights, ideology, democracy,” said Zhang Monan, senior fellow at the U.S.-Europe Institute at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing. “This kind of opposition and friction is expected to continue.” She added that the EU is expected to formulate policy independently since it doesn’t want to be subordinate to the U.S.

The European Commission is now proposing rules to levy fines and block deals targeted at foreign state-owned companies, while Merkel’s cabinet approved additional powers over foreign investment last week aimed at high-tech sectors including artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Both measures would hinder China.

China had hoped to separate economic issues from political issues and to bind Europe with its huge consumer market, but that’s increasingly impossible now, said an academic at a Chinese government-affiliated think tank. Ratification of the CAI has become more challenging, said the person, who is not authorized to comment publicly due to rules on speaking to foreign media.

Signs of the tensions were on show during the virtual talks led by Merkel and Li. In a departure from usual practice, the opening remarks were not live-streamed and there was no concluding press conference. A transcript posted several hours later by Germany showed that Merkel addressed human rights, saying there were differences of opinion particularly over Hong Kong.

“China and Germany have different views on some issues, this is a fact,” Li told Merkel, urging Germany not interfere in internal matters, according to a statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Li said he hoped they could “eliminate unnecessary distractions” to maintain “healthy and stable” bilateral ties.

That change could get more pronounced if the Greens convert their opinion poll lead into a strong showing or even victory in September, with Merkel set to step aside. While all coalitions involve policy trade-offs, the Greens have a harsher line on China than the current administration, calling for an end to Beijing’s “blatant human-rights violations” and for closer European and transatlantic coordination on China.

A coalition with the conservatives as suggested by polls would see continuity in German foreign policy but with “different nuances” on China, said Jana Puglierin, head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “The Greens would clearly advocate a less mercantilist policy than we have seen under Merkel,” she said.

For now, Europe is determined to avoid decoupling entirely with China. French President Emmanuel Macron and Merkel held a joint call with Xi in April, and a report in China’s Global Times on April 28 referred to “optimism and confidence in China-Germany cooperation” despite the risk of “some impacts” after the election. Merkel’s would-be successors and business leaders know the “great potential” of Europe working with China, “so they need to ensure healthy ties won’t be interrupted by any third party or internal conservative forces.”

Still, Wuttke at the European trade chamber said that China underestimates the concern over human rights in Germany. Especially after the departure of Merkel, who favored engagement with China, that’s likely to “translate into possibly more assertive policy in Berlin,” he said.",,/r/europe/comments/n4mt5p/china_tensions_spill_over_as_europe_moves_toward/gwwbyfd/,quixotic_cynic,1620130494

And b) germany didnt fire nomb anything. They didnt have the technology fir that in 1940. It was a ""normal"" bombing raid that caused a fire that killed around 800 people and made 5000 homeless.
Not what i would consider  ""absolutely sacked"". By the rest of europes standarts doring the war this would be a best a daily occurance.

3421,"""it's only racist if it shows a negative stereotype""
Uh, no. Definitely not. Assuming someone must be great at maths just because they're Asian is still racist. You can't honestly believe that. Saying ""all black people are athletically build"" is still racist, obviously.

""Breaking news: black people do have black skin"" Aah so Zwarte Piet is supposed to represent a black person after all! It's just not a caricature according to you. I guess the Nazi poster isn't a racist caricature either, but actually very faithful! Or are you now gonna change your position to deny that they're virtually the exact same?

""Just like Saint Nicholas is not represented as a 4th century Byzantine Greek"" he also isn't a racist caricature. That being said, his dress is actually very faithful. Just the staff that's a bit weird there I suppose.

""The nazi poster only proves that they caricaturize black people, not that zwarte piet is intended to ridicule black people.""
Ah okay so now you admit that it is a caricature after all! Scrap my ""I guess the poster isn't a racist caricature"" comment from above. You are aware!

So what, your issue is that people who play Zwarte Piet don't intent to be racist? Because nobody is saying that they are. Nobody is saying ""people who dress up as zwarte piet are racist."" The point is that the way Zwarte Piet is presented, is racist.
Intentionality doesn't determine whether or not something is racist.

""rather than rebuking"" I'm doing both at the same time. Bit of hypocrisy when you're the one who started. Besides, don't even pretend you made a sincere argument there, with your ""Zwarte Piet is older than the Nazi poster though!"".

3460,"&gt;So Britain did cede meaningful home rule then, thanks for contradicting yourself.

By design british subjects are consistently kept in the dark about their own history. Only Ireland, India and Scotland appealed for Home Rule, and none of them got it. In Ireland and India's case they declared independence, Scotland just got shafted, there was a referendum but the result was disregarded because of 'low turnout'.

&gt;Ireland, or Eire, had Dominion status up until 1949.

Ireland established its own parliament in 1919. All this impotent Westminister activity afterwards was purely theatrics for a domestic British audience.

&gt;Only Boris has said that, not Westminster, Blair and Labour in general have consistently championed devolution and why not, it was Labour who implemented it

Boris is the prime minister. I don't know what Labour have to do with it. My expectation is that the UK will dissolve in a matter of years, the devolved parliaments are a distraction.

&gt;By the US in 1924, two years after the Anglo Irish agreement, lol.

The UK obviously didn't recognise the Irish parliament until much later, deciding it was 'illegal' and then unilaterally making statements about 'Home Rule' and 'Dominion Status' to itself.

The Superga air disaster occurred on 4 May 1949, when a Fiat G.212 of Avio Linee Italiane (Italian Airlines), carrying the entire Torino football team crashed into the retaining wall at the back of the Basilica of Superga, which stands on a hill on the outskirts of Turin.

In the worst case it was sloppy work by the guys who developed it.

And that is an issue. 

But it’s easier to cry „the evil west“ then to Fix things.

&gt;And EOKA brutality was against Turks too, years earlier than 1958.  

Where is your evidence for that? Before 1958 the Greek Cypriots were fighting against the British colonialists. Not the Turkish Cypriots. 

This was the reason EOKA was founded, to fight the Colonialists and to liberate Cyprus.

The British first hired Turkish Cypriots as an auxiliary mercenary force to fight Greek Cypriots, and then Turkish Cypriots formed TMT, which had Greek Cypriots as its target and its aim was partition, i.e. our ethnic cleansing from half of our island. 

It is a historical fact that the conflict was started by the Turkish Cypriots in the 50s and they had partion as their aim since then. Whats next? Blaming Cypriots for being invaded by the Ottomans? Maybe you have some excuse for that as well?

3931,"There are several ways and it's purely to hide them in the statistics. One idea is to actually try to find them jobs, no matter how bad. Companies likes this because it's cheap labor from desperate people. Another idea is to redefine what unemployed means. This involves things like saying that if you have an activity of less than 1 hour a week, you're unemployed. After that you can simply invent random activities to keep them busy, saying it's to improve their chances to get a job. All of a sudden people go to activities once a week where they rewrite their CVs for an hour and then go home, which doesn't classify them as unemployed. A third option is to put them in training for some skilled labor like a mechanic, truck driver or baker. It doesn't guarantee a job and is pretty much invented to hide them in the statistics.

To say that countries wouldn't want to have bad relationships with certain EU provinces/states (since they are now a federation) is a bit contradictory. 

A federated EU wouldn't inherit the foreign relationships of France, Germany, etc. since those relationships are based on soft power and are depended on the trust that foreign countries have with France or Germany.

It would inherit problems though. A Russian minority in the Baltics. A border dispute with Morocco. Northern Ireland issues. And much more. Since those are depended on whether the opposing side will back down from disputes, which they won't.

I suspect many monarchists will come in and enclose other reasons why. But allow me to share these few reasons, all picked out of academic research. I´ll share some problems below those and leave the other main arguments for monarchies to my fellow monarchists since many of us have (broadly) the same reasons.

Firstly, according to this study [link](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=414065068026027127030067070117081002017016005008033085110095117005098066122064084004003032103103116031046072068113000018127103055010000046009127001094083092126091023029011005081003010010094024109003094112086125067110087116078086024084020114009096029&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE), monarchies handle large scale reforms better than a republic could. Where the latter experiences a ""valley of tears"" shortly after the implementation, the former stays consistant and even experiences a growth fase sooner than the republic. Small reforms are not affected by either a monarchy or republic.

Secondly, another study called ""Constitutional Power and Competing Risks: Monarchs, Presidents, Prime Ministers, and the Termination of East and West European Cabinets"" (I don't find a free floating pdf of it) shows that, when a democratically elected cabinet fails, a monarchy tends to prefer re-elections (democratic) instead of republics, who will prefer reshuffeling of the cabinet (undemocratic).

Thirdly, [this](https://www.socialcapitalgateway.org/sites/socialcapitalgateway.org/files/data/paper/2012/09/07/pc.pdf) study examined generalized trusts in a country. It showed that the two highest positive impacts for trust among the people were income equality and a monarchy. It is, unlike what people like to say, entirely possible to have both on the same time. [another](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035120#s2) study supports this claim regarding monarchies. Saying that, over time, monarchies either stagnate or grow in trust, but never decline.

Fourthy, [this](http://www.econ.upf.edu/~reynal/Hereditary_BesleyReynalQuerol_2015.pdf) study went into detail about hereditary leaders (monarchs). it makes two arguments, Hereditary rulers lead to economic growth, but only when executive constraints are weak and economic downturn is the main reason why monarchies fall. It also suggests that democracy and monarchy in conjunction enhance eachother by negating the negative effects of the other system.

Fifth, [this](https://faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Symbolic_Unity_Monarchies_Republics.pdf) study looked at the protection of property rights in a monarchy. i'll copy a part from the conclusion: ""Our results indicate that, in the contemporary world, traditional forms of government such as monarchies are not necessarily at a disadvantage when it comes to economic outcomes. Quite on the contrary, we found quantitatively meaningful evidence that monarchies outperform republics when it comes to protecting property rights, which translates into higher GDP per capita.""

Monarchies have issues, like the possibility of tyranny, but these can be (partially) cured by introducing other systems (like a democratic parliament) into the government. The other main issue I see is that of training the heir. Yes, training the heir from birth will make, on average, better rulers than any other system. But no, this system isn´t foolproof. There is little one can do here since the stability of a Kingdom relies on the iron law of it´s succession, altough it must be said that truly terrible rulers are very rare.",,/r/europe/comments/n498av/did_you_know_that_chess_is_a_mandatory_school/gwv8p40/,Germetvov,1620099884

Still, the message that the people themselves have part of the responsibility is resonating, and the main opposition party is lead by a decent man who speaks honestly of what he sees as the government's successes and failures.

The main reasons for discontent are the big peak in infections after christmas (world champions,  ye) and the slow vaccine rollout. But with vaccination rates going up, and portugal now out of confinement ahead of most of Europe, the situation is looking up.

Any Greek might want to chime in, but last I saw their vaccination rate was much slower.

4216,"Before soviets installed their puppet goverments, there were many different cultures coexisting in Poland. Oversimplifying, we had muslims, jews, protestants, roman catholics, greek catholics, eastern orthodox. That was intersected with ethnic diversity (IIRC about 30% of population weren't of polish ethnicity). 

The disastrous fate of Jews from Nazis during the world war 2 is well known. I would add to that, that even before the war there was enough antisemitism in polish society to make life of Jews *difficult*. I've been privileged to befriend one of survivors of these dark times, brother of author of ""Survival Artist: A Memoir of the Holocaust"". It's terrific book that describes Poland's descent into WW2 from jewish kid's perspective. A kid that loved Poland, wanted to feel being a Pole (not only as a citizen), but ultimately wasn't allowed to. I think it's a must read for everyone to see how nuanced these subjects are and that we shouldn't extrapolate individual acts to groups or nations.

Sorry, I digressed a bit.

So since the roman catholics were the largest group, after the war they ""formed"" natural opposition to communist regime. So yeah, perhaps they didn't become monolith as a pro-soviet *design*, but the *causation* is there.  Some historians - even within the RC church - argue that since oppression wasn't working out very well, state agents infiltrated  the church (if you're interested in details, I guess you can search for priest's Isakowicz-Zalewski's work in that regard).

4253,"&gt; TIL I earn more than a Latvian CEO

A CEO can have very high compensation.  But I think what people typically think of when they think of a CEO are huge companies.  And how much they're making is a function of how much they're overseeing.  If you're the CEO of Apple, your company's annual revenue is larger than Pakistan's GDP.  Then, yeah, you're running a lot of stuff.  If you're the CEO of a small chain of sandwich shops, your company isn't making that much money, and so you aren't making that much money.  Most companies are gonna look more like that chain of sandwich shops than they are Apple.

The numbers in the chart are gonna be averages, so the very large number of businesses out there that *aren't* behemoths are gonna be a factor.

And not only that...I mean, if you're talking a company in Latvia, unless it's a multinational...I mean, Latvia has a population a quarter the size of London.  Wal-Mart has more employees than Latvia has citizens.  There is just only so much business that you're gonna be overseeing.

Let me throw up US numbers:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_compensation_in_the_United_States

&gt; In 2018, the average CEO's compensation from the top 350 US firms was $17.2 million.

But...that's from the *largest 350 companies in the US*.  What happens when we aren't just looking at the largest?

https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/infographics/much-small-business-ceos-make/

Depending upon industry, the average numbers there ranged from $109k to $175k.  Which isn't shabby, but it's also orders of magnitude off what I think a number of people think of when they think of a ""CEO"".",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/n3vu8n/highest_paying_jobs_in_latvia_oc/gwtprsd/,duisThias,1620073398

I'm saying this as a more nationalistic point of view. School is a start but not end all be all. As I said today is not a national holiday for us.

4517,"&gt; Well, Bohemia was tied to the Habsburg's for about as long as we were, but I believe they still had some of their own nobles for a while. 

I was thinking more in the line of two countries being a part of *multiple* different states, in which case a similar example to Slo-Cro would be Czechia (Bohemia) and Slovakia. When we are at it, it would be interesting to know how would history went down if instead of Yu, Slovene-Croatian state was created (not counting temporary SHS).

&gt; Did your ruling nobility not get replaced by Hungarians? I don't know much about the topic. 

No, it was the opposite of that - our nobility became even stronger after entering personal union with Hungary. Sounds weird, but it was a result of complicated situation that we were in before 1102. To summarize, king Demetrius Zvonimir died in 1089. and it caused an open race for Croatian throne. It also created a looming threat of both Hungarian and Venetian attacks, so our nobile families (although somewhat divided) decided to enter the personal union with Hungarian king Koloman. On one hand that decision was reasonable from Croatian perspective - we preserved our autonomy and Hungarians still had little to none functional power in our lands, but on the other, the ones that profited the most from it were the nobile families, which rose to the position of real rulers of Croatia. Each of those nobilities (Frankopani, Šubići, Kačići, Keglevići, Nelipići etc.) amassed huge amounts of land and obtained strong authoritative power, even influencing Croatian Parliament (Sabor) and Viceroy (Ban).",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/n2jbym/european_regions_as_proposed_by_ständiger/gwsa0l9/,Dubiousmarten,1620051315

4524,"&gt; Setting minimum price for things like auto-parts is actually something called ""price fixing"". It's largely illegal because it gives companies an advantage against the consumer.

It wouldn't be illegal if it was the law. And in my example it would regulate the price for businesses, not ordinary consumers. So why don't we do it? The automakers in rich countries have plenty of money. And many of the suppliers are in countries that are not rich. If we could raise the minimum price the suppliers are paid, it would result in greater tax revenue for those countries, which they could then use for much needed investments in infrastructure and development, which would also increase economic activity back in the richer countries.

The barcode was merely a suggestion for an extra symbol, parallel to the existing EU symbols, to bring Europe in a new way to new audiences. The joining of ten new members to the EU in 2004 resulted in a first official 'update'of the barcode. The Austrian EU Presidency of 2006 marked the first official use of the barcode. AMO designed the visual identity for the Austrian EU Presidency that took place from January 2006 – July 2006.

Let's not pretend that most of euroscepticism isn't precisely because people feel like the EU is trying to replace the authority of their own country. How to represent the fact that the EU isn't some kind of political union or empire on the flag was actually a problem from the beginning, and in some countries it still is.

For example, Macron during his campaign asked ""europeanists"" to wave the european flag at his meeting. It was the first time a candidate did something like that in France. And of course his opponents took that as an insult towards the french flag. Maybe it could have been different if the european flag had a small french one on it.

Some political parties want to get rid of the christian symbolism and sometimes try to suggest new designs.

And the support for Putin and those like him is still very high because of all the crap propaganda Putin shows everywhere :/

4929,"""The Eastern Partnership turns 12 this year. When it launched in 2009, the initiative’s goal was to strengthen political relationships between the European Union and the six countries in the Eastern Partnership – and to encourage economic integration by promoting reforms in those states. Since then, the EU has achieved some successes: Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine concluded associated agreements with Brussels, and these countries’ citizens won the right to visit the EU without visas. Armenia entered into an extended partnership agreement with the EU. Belarus’s visa regime was eased.

However, despite the strengthening of EU policy positions on certain matters, problems remain throughout the Eastern Partnership region. Conflicts – both ‘frozen’ and ‘hot’ – are playing out in all countries with the exception of Belarus, while Russia uses each of the six as part of its geopolitical designs. Progress on political reform over the last 12 years also leaves much to be desired, particularly in light of a number of post-Soviet states’ constant attempts to return to old authoritarian ways. The Eastern Partnership is now going through its most difficult period yet with a cascade of political and humanitarian crises, and even a war between Eastern Partnership states.""",,/r/europe/comments/n3pj8z/happy_birthday_eastern_partnership_celebrations/gwr5fox/,JackRogers3,1620023191

**Kosovo**:

has never participated in the Eurovision Song Contest on its own, but the contest has had a long history within the country which has broadcast it since 1961, and after the start of Kosovo's UN administration, the Kosovan public broadcaster RTK has been independently licensed by the EBU to broadcast all three shows. Despite not having participated at the song contest, Kosovo did participate in the Eurovision Young Dancers 2011.

As Kosovo is not part of the United Nations and RTK not part of the International Telecommunication Union, RTK cannot apply to become a full member of the EBU.

Jugovizija, was the national pre-selection of Yugoslavia organised by the Yugoslav broadcaster Yugoslav Radio Television (JRT) since 1961 and it featured entries submitted by the subnational public broadcasting centres based in the capitals of each of the constituent republics and autonomous provinces. Each broadcasting centre had its own regional jury. SAP Kosovo was represented by RTV Priština, but their entry has never won. Jugovizija 1986 was organised by RTV Priština. Before 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence, Viktorija a singer from Vučitrn represented Yugoslavia as part of Aska in 1982 and Nevena Božović from Mitrovica represented Serbia in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2007.

After the break-up of Yugoslavia, numerous Kosovo Albanian singers participated at the Festivali i Këngës which is the Albanian national selection for Eurovision organised by RTSH. The most notable participants to date were Rona Nishliu who represented Albania in the Eurovision 2012 and Lindita who represented Albania in the Eurovision 2017. Some singers, especially Kosovo Serbs, participate in Serbian national selection organised by RTS. Nevena Božović also represented Serbia as a member of Moje 3 in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 and as a solo artist in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019.

After Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008, its broadcaster Radio Television of Kosovo (RTK) applied for EBU membership, and wished to enter Kosovo into Eurovision Song Contest 2009. There is a co-operation agreement signed between the EBU and RTK and the EBU supports the membership of RTK. From 2013 on, RTK has observer status within the EBU.

**Lebanon**:

Lebanon has never participated in the Eurovision Song Contest. The country's broadcasting organisation, Télé Liban, was set to make the country's debut at the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 with the song ""Quand tout s'enfuit"" performed by Aline Lahoud, but withdrew due to Lebanon's laws banning the broadcast of Israeli content.

**Lichtenstein:**

Liechtenstein has never participated at the Eurovision Song Contest, but the contest has had a long history within the country, with at least one attempt to participate being made by the principality.

On 15 August 2008, 1FLTV, licensed by Liechtenstein's government, became the first broadcaster based in Liechtenstein. This would allow the country to begin competing at the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time, should they decide to join the EBU, a pre-requisite for entering the contest. Shortly after its foundation however, the broadcaster announced that they were not interested in joining the EBU or Eurovision at that time because they had no budget for membership.

In July 2009, the broadcaster officially announced its intent to apply to join the EBU by the end of July, with the intent of taking part at the Eurovision Song Contest 2010, to be held in Oslo, Norway. Peter Kölbel, managing director of 1FLTV, officially confirmed the broadcaster's interest, revealing that they had plans to develop a national final similar to Deutschland sucht den Superstar, the German version of the Idol series. In November 2009, 1FLTV decided to postpone EBU and Eurovision plans, due to financial reasons began to search for other options for funding EBU membership in the future.

1FLTV submitted its application for EBU membership on 29 July 2010. If accepted, 1FLTV would have gained full EBU membership and would have been able to send an entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 2011. However, Liechtenstein did not appear on the official list of participants for Eurovision 2011. In late 2012 it was announced by Peter Kölbel of 1FLTV that Liechtenstein would not be able to take part till 2013 at the earliest. They had been trying to get government subsidies since 2010 to enable participation, participation was likely if in April 2012 the Government approved funding.

On 10 September 2013, 1FLTV informed and confirmed to Esctoday.com that Liechtenstein would not be participating at the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The broadcaster has no plans to join the EBU at the moment. This was confirmed again on 28 July 2014 in the run-up to the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 in Austria. 1FLTV did however state their interest in participating in the Eurovision Song Contest, but that they have to evaluate the costs of EBU membership, a necessary prelude to participation. 1FLTV confirmed that the nation will not be able to make its début in 2016, due to lack of funds to join the EBU. On 21 September 2016, 1FLTV announced that they would not be able to debut to the contest in 2017, but that they would set their eyes on a future participation once they overcome their financial hurdles. Yet again, on 1 September 2017 they also announced they would not debut at the 2018 contest in Lisbon.

On 4 November 2017 the broadcaster confirmed that it was planning to debut in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2019 and would organise a national selection to select both the singer and the song. However, on 20 July 2018, the EBU stated that 1 FL TV have not applied for membership.

**Scotland:**

The Scottish National Party (SNP) has campaigned for a place in Eurovision for Scotland but had been rejected numerous times because Scotland is represented as a part of the British entry and is represented by the BBC. On 11 February 2008 the EBU stated that a Scottish broadcaster could apply for EBU membership, but under the current rules could not enter the Eurovision Song Contest as the BBC currently has exclusive rights to represent the entire United Kingdom.

Scotland would have been eligible to enter the contest had Scotland gained independence as a result of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, as Scotland would, therefore, have been a separate country.

On 25 November 2013, the Scottish Government released a referendum blueprint which detailed plans for the transfer of BBC Scotland into the Scottish Broadcasting Service (SBS) and joining the EBU, as well as partaking in competitions, including Scottish entries in the Eurovision Song Contest. Had the referendum vote been favour of independence, then the earliest that Scotland would be eligible to debut would have been 2017. However, the referendum result on 18 September 2014 was to remain part of the United Kingdom, and the aforementioned BBC retains exclusive rights to represent the United Kingdom, including Scotland.

**Tunisia**:

Tunisia attempted to enter the 1977 edition of the contest and was scheduled fourth in the running order, however, prior to selecting an act, the country withdrew for undisclosed reasons. It is believed that Tunisia's member broadcaster, Établissement de la radiodiffusion-télévision tunisienne (ERTT), did not want to compete with Israel. In 2007, ERTT clarified that it would not participate in the contest in the foreseeable future due to governmental requests.

**Other countries**:

Four countries – Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, and Libya – have broadcasters that are members of both the EBU and the Arab States Broadcasting Union. Although they could participate, it is believed that they refuse to do so due to the ongoing participation of Israel. Vatican City could participate through its member broadcaster Vatican Radio (RV), which was also a founding member of the EBU, though RV only broadcasts papal events, and the population is less than 900 – the vast majority of whom are clergy.",Dalmatia,/r/europe/comments/n3pn7n/eurovision_participation_since_1956/gwr6ck8/,ManusTheVantablack,1620024018

4972,"&gt;I mean yea, I'd call them soviet colonies, but okay. Why are the capitalist countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America so poor then?

&amp;#x200B;

But capitalist countries in Asia or Latin America (as I know not much about Africa) are not so poor. You can compare mainland China with its historically vast infrastructure against Taiwan, a historical backwater. Or China and Japan. Or historically industrially advanced North Korea against historically less developed agrarian South Korea. 

Or you can compare Thailand to Vietnam. Or Philippines to Vietnam. Or Thailand to Burma. Or India to Burma. 

China, then, rises above minor Asian countries only by adopting capitalistic principles, in many ways far more cruelly than in the west, in other ways much less perfectly and remaining still on a global scale a relatively backward economy even in 2020.

We can also compare Cuba and Puerto Rico. Or Cuba and Bahamas. Or Cuba and the Caribbean islands where tourists can come to a free country. Nicaragua to every single other central american country.

5023,"&gt;Easter is the only main Christian holiday that is still close to the original Jewish traditions, it’s also uses a lunar calendar similar to the Jewish calendar which is why it’s on a different date every year and why it’s about a week after Passover (the orthodox one is a bit more off).

Slight correction (and some fun facts): sometimes, Catholics and Protestants observe Easter *before* Passover, and often times on the same week.  Orthodox and Copts usually observe Easter about a week after Passover, but on occasion, they observe Easter long after Passover.

At the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, early Christians decided that Easter should fall after Passover, but that Christians should come up with *their own* Passover calculation instead of basing it off of Jewish communities.  In the 16th Century, Pope Gregory XIII revised the calendar, because the old Roman calendar (the Julian calendar) that was used up until that point was flawed, and had fallen 11 days behind.  The new calendar added the leap years and leap days to account for the fact that one solar year isn't exactly 365 days.  So, the Catholic church started calculating Easter according to this new calendar, and within the next couple hundred years Protestants followed suit.  But the Orthodox continue using the old Roman calendar to this day.  And here we are.  Both sides are technically wrong...the Council of Nicaea doesn't say to base the calculations for Easter on a *calendar,* but on the moon cycles and the spring equinox.  There's been talks for reforming this calculation and coming up with a unified date for Easter, and the churches came close in the 1990s, but the stubborn Orthodox (I'm baptized Orthodox) pulled out last minute, surprise surprise.",,/r/europe/comments/n3i6t3/easter_in_european_languages/gwqxfgp/,skyduster88,1620016802

5069,"But he wasn't being ""handed over to the US"", he was supposed to be handed over to Sweden. Everyone defending him always take it as read that extradition to Sweden would automatically mean extradition to the US, but there's never any logical chain of reasoning for why that would be so.

It would be *more* difficult to extradite him via Sweden since the extradition process would have to pass two countries (Sweden and the UK) rather than one. We also have some pretty strict laws about what sort of crimes someone can be extradited for. Consequently it would have been easier for the US to get him through the UK alone than through some vast conspiracy that used Sweden as a stopover.

The stated intention of the prosecutor was to arrest him and bring him to trial, for which you definitely do need physical access to the person. I personally think they should have just gone sooner to show good will to the Equadoreans, but it's certainly not common practice to conduct an investigation on the suspect's terms and in a situation where you can't bring the case forward if the suspect doesn't want it, so the stance of the Swedish prosecutor is understandable.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/n2j9sx/julian_assange_mural_in_berlin/gwr13an/,Vimmelklantig,1620019575

5086,"The partition of Ireland (Irish: críochdheighilt na hÉireann) was the process by which the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland divided Ireland into two self-governing polities: Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. It took place on 3 May 1921 under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The Act intended for both home rule territories to remain within the United Kingdom and contained provisions for their eventual reunification

The smaller Northern Ireland was duly created with a devolved government and remained part of the UK. The larger Southern Ireland was not recognized by most of its citizens, who instead recognized the self-declared Irish Republic. Following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the territory of Southern Ireland left the UK and became the Irish Free State, now the Republic of Ireland.

The territory that became Northern Ireland, within the Irish province of Ulster, had a Protestant and Unionist majority who wanted to maintain ties to Britain. This was largely due to 17th century British colonization. The rest of Ireland had a Catholic and Irish nationalist majority who wanted self-governance or independence.

Since partition, Irish nationalists and republicans continue to seek a reunited Ireland whereby the whole island would be an independent state, while Ulster unionists want Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK. 

The Unionist governments of Northern Ireland were accused of discrimination against the Irish nationalist and Catholic minority. A campaign to end discrimination was opposed by hardline Unionists who said it was a republican front. This sparked the Troubles (c.1969–98), a thirty-year conflict in which more than 3,500 people were killed. 

Under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the Irish and British governments agreed that the status of Northern Ireland will not change without the consent of a majority of its population.

In its white paper on Brexit, the British government reiterated its commitment to the Agreement. On Northern Ireland's status, it said that the government's ""clearly-stated preference is to retain Northern Ireland's current constitutional position: as part of the UK, but with strong links to Ireland"".",Romania,/r/europe/comments/n3orqp/3_may_1921_under_the_british_government_of/gwr1sm4/,filosoful,1620020130

Some people without other savings move abroad and live comfortably on the beach in Mexico or the Philippines.

The US actually has a lot of safety nets, but they tend to be stingy to discourage their use/abuse. For example, people that make under a certain amount of money get free healthcare called medicaid.

And yet for all its charms, there was always a far simpler reason why more than a thousand multinational companies have their main European headquarters in Ireland. Tax. For a generation, Ireland has had the lowest corporate tax rate - just 12.5 per cent - in the developed world. Even better, myriad breaks and allowances - in accounting circles the ‘Double Irish’ is not as you might imagine an especially stiff glass of Jameson’s but a fiendishly clever way of re-routing revenues - often take that down even further. The result? Companies from Apple to Google to Pfizer have huge operations in Ireland, creating tens of thousands of jobs, and an economy that is among the most prosperous in the world.
&gt; 
&gt; But hold on. It now looks as if Ireland's low-tax miracle is over. First, President Biden, despite getting sentimental of his family's roots in County Mayo whenever he faces an electorate he thinks might celebrate St Patrick’s Day, is proposing a global minimum corporate tax rate of 21 per cent. That won’t make a lot of difference to France (28 per cent), or Germany (30 per cent) or indeed the UK (19 per cent, rising to 25 per cent). But it will make a heck of a big difference to Ireland. In effect, it will have to double its rate. Now the European Union has joined in. According to a report in the Irish Times, the Commission is pushing for the Irish to end its tax breaks as a condition of receiving its share of the money set to be distributed through the €750 billion Coronavirus Rescue Fund. Raise taxes or you don’t get the cash is the message from Brussels.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, the EU’s position is very odd. Ireland is a net contributor to the EU’s budget, now that the UK has left, so it will be a net contributor to the Rescue Fund as well. In effect, Ireland is being told that in exchange for paying for a bail-out for Italy and Spain it will be forced to wreck the competitiveness of its own economy. Understandably, Ireland is starting to push back against that. In a speech last month, the finance minister Paschal Donahue attempted to make the argument that smaller countries should be allowed lower levies to compensate for the economies of scale enjoyed by their rivals. Really? As it happens. Ireland is a member of the world’s largest Single Market, so it can hardly complain its economy lacks scale. In fact, the only credible argument Ireland can make is that as a sovereign nation it is perfectly entitled to set any tax rates it chooses. However, as enthusiastic Europeans that is a tricky one.
&gt; 
&gt; And yet, in truth, nothing else will work. Between Biden and Brussels, Ireland is getting caught in a trap. It is hard to see how it can avoid raising its corporate tax rate to 20 per cent-plus to bring it into line with the rest of the developed world. Of course, it will still have a skilled workforce, the English language, and access to the European market to recommend it to the world’s multinationals as a corporate base. But its four decades as a low-tax corporate hub are coming to an end - and with it four decades of buoyant prosperity may be over as well.",,/r/europe/comments/n3meli/irelands_lowtax_miracle_is_over/gwqp7sb/,PLanPLan,1620011422

5153,"&gt; I don't know of any executive that is directly elected.

Not on a person-by-person basis, but by choosing its head.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_system

&gt;A presidential system, or single executive system, is a form of government in which a head of government (president) leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch. This head of government is in most cases also the head of state.
&gt;
&gt;In presidential countries, the head of government is elected and is not responsible to the legislature, which cannot (usually) in normal circumstances dismiss it.

-

&gt;A presidential system contrasts with a parliamentary system, where the head of government comes to power by gaining the confidence of an elected legislature. There are also hybrid systems such as the semi-presidential system, used in the former Weimar Republic and in France.

Countries with presidential systems of government do that.

And in parliamentary systems, you're still choosing the executive via your votes for the legislature; you just don't separate the two.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/n3f3nd/the_european_commission_is_becoming_more_powerful/gwqph5e/,duisThias,1620011580

The Turkish Cypriots were armed and trained by Turkey, and they had the support of the Turkish airforce which bombed Cyprus.

As for Poland and religion classes? Basically what you're saying is ""religion is poison because they're teaching something contrary to what I don't like"". And you know, you're entitled to disagree with it, but it's still a subjective position you're taking. I might think that the idea that, say, a married couple shouldn't just enjoy sex is a little much. But truthfully, our sexual organs and reproductive systems are *primarily* for reproduction - just like how your earlobes *can* be an erogenous zone but your ears' function is still hearing, or you *can* swallow a sword but your esophagus' function is getting food &amp; water into your digestive system. Sex organs are primarily for reproduction, and enjoyment is secondary to that (which you an also see by the fact that you can really not enjoy the sex but a pregnancy can still result from it).   


It might be a somewhat extreme idea for *everyone* to *only ever* have sex for reproduction, sure. But imo it's much better to constantly remind people that sex inherently can make a baby &amp; to take that (primary) function of sex very seriously in your personal relationships, than it is to teach people in a way that suggests sex is for fun first and foremost, and end up with a bunch of people who act surprised and angry when their one-night stand or rushed sexual relationship with some jerk leads to a baby.   


You might not like the religious viewpoint you're mentioning, but it seems to me that it actually lines up better with the realities of sex than the non-religious viewpoint you prefer.

5305,"**Hungary**

- Infections are going down nicely, there have been less than 2.5k daily new cases all week, the reproduction rate is currently in the 0.6-0.7 range. Deaths are still somewhat high, though daily deaths have been under 200 for a week now (the rolling average was above 200 for 36 consecutive days, it's now at 168).

- As of Sunday morning, 4.06M people have received a vaccine dose, including 2.02M who are fully vaccinated, which is 61.82 doses per 100 people, nearly double the EU average (32.98). Today we also hit 6M total doses administered.

- The race to the 4M first dose mark was [quite comical](https://hungarytoday.hu/hungary-pfizer-chaos-friday-vaccination/). A week ago, the government launched an appointment booking site for Sinopharm and later the AZ vaccines. In the small hours on Friday this was also opened for the Pfizer vaccine. Naturally, people stormed the site so it crashed at 7am (naturally, the government blamed it on a 'cyber attack' by 'irresponsible persons') and long queues gathered at vaccination sites, many of which ran out of Pfizer jabs before midday. In a desperate effort to reach the milestone on Friday (allegedly to allow [Saturday football matches](https://hungarytoday.hu/sports-events-soon-begin-hungary-impact-pandemic/) to admit spectators), some vaccines which had been intended for second-round vaccinations were also used.

- On Saturday, cinemas, museums, spas, zoos and the interiors of bars and restaurants [reopened](https://hungarytoday.hu/hungary-4-million-rules-measures/) after reaching 4M first vaccinations on Friday, while the start of the nightly curfew has been pushed back to midnight and shops can stay open until 11pm. There weren't such tumultous scenes as on the Saturday the week before, when the terraces of bars and restaurants were opened following the 3.5M mark. The newest measures are the first where an immunity certificate is required to access the services. The certificates got some attention this week, as the rapid vaccine rollout triggered a backlog of plastic cards, and the government is threatening the forgery of the card with up to 5 years' imprisonment.

- On Tuesday, [Parliament approved 19 different bills](https://insighthungary.444.hu/2021/04/29/hungary-will-not-expel-russian-diplomats-over-czech-explosion-alone-in-the-v4) amending higher education laws, creating 'public interest asset management foundations' and placing universities into the ownership of such foundations. In this round of 'outsourcing' 12 universities were handed over to foundations, following several other universities last summer and Corvinus University two years ago, which served as the trial of the foundation model, so only five universities are left in state ownership. Parliament also created [other education and agriculture-oriented foundations](https://hungarytoday.hu/orban-fidesz-govt-outsourcing-state-assets-public-funds-robbery-deep-state/) and the wealth given away to these foundations total several trillion forints (1 trillion HUF is about €2.7bn; the total GDP (PPP) of Hungary was ~€220bn in 2019). The oposition argued that this is a vehicle for Fidesz to [empty the coffers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-27/hungary-to-shift-billions-in-funds-in-move-decried-as-theft) in anticipation of a possible election loss next year (and make the country ungovernable with a simple majority, as the rules governing the new foundations need a two-thirds majority to be changed), and also criticised the selection of trustees, as several incumbent Fidesz mayors, ministers and state secretaries got positions.

- Earlier today, oppisition party Democratic Coalition (DK-S&amp;D) unsurprisingly announced Klára Dobrev MEP as its candidate for PM in the upcoming opposition primary elections. Dobrev, who is the wife of party leader and former socialist PM Ferenc Gyurcsány (2004-09), entered politics before the 2019 EP elections, where she was DK's lead candidate and tripled the party's electoral support from 5.4% in the 2018 parliamentary elections to 16.1%, making DK the largest opposition party. Polls currently suggest she's not leading the race for the premiership, but she has a good chance to get into the second round of the primaries, which will be held in September and October.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/n3114l/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20210502/gwpsv3g/,dickblaha,1619993740

But tl;dr this is why they did it:

&gt;*The expedition against Benin was the culmination of several British assaults on the west African kingdoms that now form Nigeria. In 1897, it was the turn of Oba Ovonramwen, king of Benin, to deliver up his land, his people, and his treasures to a British army. The 40-year-old Oba had kept his kingdom isolated and independent, but the British were endlessly plotting to overcome his protectionist zeal. These were the years of the global rubber boom, consequent on John Dunlop's invention of the rubber inner tube. The virgin forests of Benin looked especially attractive.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The man who encompassed the Oba's downfall, Ralph Moor, was effectively the governor of Britain's Niger Coast protectorate. Moor, 36, had long argued that Benin should be opened up to trade, ""if necessary by force"". Like so many other colonial policemen, he had earlier been an inspector with the Royal Irish Constabulary, stifling rebellion in Ireland.

**Valdis Dombrovskis says there has been a ‘very welcome shift’ since start of Biden administration**

The EU’s trade commissioner has said he is increasingly hopeful of securing a deal with the Biden administration to end a 16-year feud over subsidies for Airbus and Boeing, in what would be a breakthrough in transatlantic trade relations. 

Valdis Dombrovskis told the Financial Times that the EU and US were engaging “very intensively” on resolving their trade disputes, as he hailed a “very welcome shift” since Joe Biden’s administration took office in January. 

The discussions on aircraft subsidies are a particular point of focus, given the shared desire in Brussels and Washington to end a dispute that during the past two years has led each side to hit the other with punitive tariffs on trade worth billions of dollars. 

Those duties — on a wide range of products from French wine to US sugar molasses — are currently suspended after the EU and US agreed in March to lift them for four months, creating the political space for negotiations. 

“The work is ongoing and I think there are reasons to expect we will be able to resolve this issue, and that we will not have to return to this mutual imposition of tariffs,” Dombrovskis said. 

Dombrovskis said the two sides were working on new rules, known as disciplines, on future subsidy arrangements for the airline sector. Asked whether the talks could achieve success within the four-month window announced on March 5, the commissioner said: “We are currently working with this timeline in mind.”

The dispute is one of the longest-running cases in the history of the World Trade Organization. Both sides have been found over the years to have failed to properly implement WTO panel rulings on illegal subsidies.",,/r/europe/comments/n3ezao/eu_trade_chief_hopeful_of_deal_with_us_to_end/gwpevpq/,quixotic_cynic,1619986765

**Brussels is taking responsibility for the continent’s physical and economic health**

Brussels is at its noisiest when things are at their worst. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, clangs from crisis to crisis. The year began with a botched ban on vaccine exports that triggered a row over Northern Ireland and scotched the eu’s free-trading reputation. Her office sent a bizarrely dismissive message to the president of Ukraine after he invited Mrs von der Leyen to an independence day celebration while Russian troops massed on the country’s border. Those with kind words about the president’s leadership keep quiet; those who think she is not up to the job are loud. Beneath the brouhaha, a change is afoot. Under the maligned Mrs von der Leyen, the commission is becoming more powerful.

Some new powers stem from crisis. A plan to dish out cash to struggling governments has left the commission as a proto-treasury, signing off economic policy and handing out money. In exchange for a share of €750bn ($895bn) in grants and loans, eu governments must overhaul their economies in line with Brussels-approved plans. It is a familiar scheme. During the euro-zone crisis, the commission demanded wrenching reforms from stricken countries in exchange for bail-out cash. Except that now all countries are in the same boat. In a development that would make the psychological conditioners in “A Clockwork Orange” cheer, those countries that had experienced such a programme knew exactly what to do. Efforts from Spain and Greece, both bail-out veterans, were highly praised. Draft proposals suggested by the German government, which is more accustomed to prescribing economic medicine than taking it, were initially knocked back.

Brussels has long begged countries to reform. Yet outside a bail-out programme, it has never had the clout. Each year, the commission comes up with well-meaning suggestions for national governments, which are almost always ignored. Now the commission can in theory turn the cash taps off if planned reforms are not done. Although the €750bn recovery fund is a one-off, commissioners such as Paolo Gentiloni, the Italian overseeing the scheme, suggest that the mechanism could be used again. Temporary measures can easily become permanent, as anyone who pays income tax will appreciate. At that point, the proto-treasury becomes a real one.",,/r/europe/comments/n3f3nd/the_european_commission_is_becoming_more_powerful/gwpfkjs/,quixotic_cynic,1619987104

5463,"&gt;And it's terrifying, because nobody is hunted down for doing it

Yes, it is, but it has nothing to do with the comment I answered to. That guy was claiming that the Church was ""destroying Poland"", which is nonsense.

&gt;Pedophilia doesn't happen in corporations and banks, but in church it happens.

Of course it does happen, and that's leaving aside the much wider scope of sexual violence in the workplace which is being hidden under the rug...

It even happens in public education. In France, where I live, there are about 20 school teachers definitively fired each year for involvment in pedofilia-related crimes. And there were quite a few cases (especially back in time) of teachers being hidden by their hierarchy and sent elsewhere (other city/school) following accusations - to avoid scandals which would backfire at the hierarchy members itself.

It's similar to how corporations' management tends to hide issues of racism and sexual violence in the workplace, since everybody is trying to save their career and the institution's face. In the case of the Church it is much worse in that they're supposed to represent certain ethical standards, but fundamentally it's the same omerta issue that any big institution faces. There are always some skeletons in the closet, although they can vary in nature. Same with the military, banks, etc.

Nowadays there's less social pressure preventing people from talking about these things, and hopefully we'll get to a point where they'll be almost gone. But that's not really the point of this discussion anyway.",,/r/europe/comments/n33sks/rare_photo_of_the_opening_day_of_a_shooting_range/gwpflsc/,Swobodny,1619987121

Even where the commission messes up, it manages to emerge more powerful. The commission took the lead in ensuring that the supply of vaccines did not descend into an undignified brawl among eu countries. Although it avoided a fight, it was less successful in securing supplies. When vaccines did arrive, Europeans watched as America—whose health system is seen in Europe as barbaric—jabbed its citizens more quickly. Diplomats fault the execution, but not the idea of having the commission in charge of such a situation. Angela Merkel, still the most influential leader even as she leaves the stage, wants the eu and by proxy the commission to have a bigger role in health care. Health crises—by their nature, life-and-death issues—are now dealt with at the European level, in a shift that may well continue.

Longer-term plans will see more power handed to Brussels. It is easy to dismiss the eu’s “green deal” as a gimmick. In fact it is a three-decade project that will up-end the continent, in much the same way that the single market did from the 1980s. To make Europe climate-neutral by 2050, the commission will overhaul entire markets and industries. This shift is already happening. Decisions such as whether nuclear or gas technology will qualify as “green” will be taken by the commission, sometimes with only a supermajority of member states able to overrule it. Whether France can splash out on another generation of nuclear-power plants will be settled in Brussels as much as Paris. Environmental policy was shunted to the eu level in the 1970s and 1980s when it was a fringe issue; now it is an existential problem facing every government. But it is Brussels rather than the 27 national capitals that will lead the continent’s response for the next 30 years.",,/r/europe/comments/n3f3nd/the_european_commission_is_becoming_more_powerful/gwpfmum/,quixotic_cynic,1619987135

**Slapstick integration**

A powerful centre has emerged under ostensibly weak leadership before. When Jacques Delors was the commission’s president, he oversaw the introduction of the single market and set the path to the euro between 1985-95. Little was expected of the Frenchman when he took office. The then European Economic Community (eec) was stuck in a rut. (A few years before, The Economist had published a front cover with a gravestone marked “eec Born March 25th 1957/ Moribund March 25th 1982.”) Like Mrs von der Leyen, he had not run a government before. And like Mrs von der Leyen, Mr Delors was shunted to Brussels only after his domestic political career had been written off by a powerful ally: François Mitterrand in the case of Mr Delors and Mrs Merkel in the case of Mrs von der Leyen, who had once been tipped as a possible future chancellor. Mrs von der Leyen was chided for being too close to Paris; Mr Delors, to Berlin.

After ten years of Mr Delors, a radically different eu had emerged. Luck rather than leadership has always been more helpful in running the European Union. Mr Delors benefited from national leaders willing to cede power to the burgeoning centre. Likewise, circumstance rather than political skill has led to Mrs von der Leyen’s commission taking more power. National leaders are, once more, happy to hand over sovereignty to Brussels, if it means prosperity and health. Mr Delors was loud and proud about his plans for a deeper eu. Indeed, he was often too noisy, giving speeches about his dreams of a federal Europe that made Mitterrand splutter, never mind Margaret Thatcher. Today, eu leaders—whether in Brussels or in national capitals—are altogether more shy about the realities of European integration. Yet it is still happening, sotto voce. Integration by stealth is never healthy. Better, it seems, to shout about it. ■",,/r/europe/comments/n3f3nd/the_european_commission_is_becoming_more_powerful/gwpfp3k/,quixotic_cynic,1619987166

5564,"The Orthodox church never switched to the [Gregorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) calendar.

&gt;There were two reasons to establish the Gregorian calendar. First, the Julian calendar assumed incorrectly that the average solar year is exactly 365.25 days long, an overestimate of a little under one day per century. The Gregorian reform shortened the average (calendar) year by 0.0075 days to stop the drift of the calendar with respect to the [equinoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox).[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-text-3) Second, in the years since the [First Council of Nicaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea) in AD 325,[\[Note 1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-4) the excess leap days introduced by the Julian algorithm had caused the calendar to drift such that the [(Northern) spring equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox) was occurring well before its nominal 21 March date. This date was important to the Christian churches because it is fundamental to the [calculation of the date of Easter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_of_Easter). To reinstate the association, the reform advanced the date by 10 days: Thursday 4 October 1582 was followed by Friday 15 October 1582.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#cite_note-text-3) In addition, the reform also altered the lunar cycle used by the Church to calculate the date for Easter, because astronomical new moons were occurring four days before the calculated dates.",Norway,/r/europe/comments/n3amr0/happy_orthodox_easter_to_those_who_are/gwp039r/,Sherool,1619980050

It is certainly not a no-brainer. And there we are again at the beginning. Deciding whether nuclear is best or renewables is a pretty complex topic that can't be compared to denying climate change, anti-vaxxers or flat earthers.

Regarding the storage: For all these roadmaps it isn't necessary that the storage already exists today or is fully matured.

First of all, I don’t “believe in science”. I believe in the integrity of tens of thousands of scientists **around the world** who agree on scientific facts.

That is called the scientific method and is the way science has worked for well over a century of greatest human progress since the dawn of time.

Second, **I am** a published scientist in the medical field and have a good enough understanding of viruses, vaccines and epidemiology to know when someone is full of shit just for publicity’s sake. And guess what ? It’s not the hundreds of thousands of medical professionals around the world working their ass off to see humanity through this crisis, it’s the scum that degrade everything the scientific community stands for so they can have their minute in the spotlight.

5717,"I really do wonder why they would teach incorrect information in universities... 

Anyway, the information is too plentiful to sort and share so I best advice for you to do your own research (it really is not that hard) but I'll share a quick snippet from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade) (all the sources they cite are listed on the article so you can check those): 

&gt; Slavery was prevalent in many parts of Africa for many centuries before the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade. There is evidence that enslaved people from some parts of Africa were exported to states in Africa, Europe, and Asia prior to the European colonization of the Americas.

&gt; The Atlantic slave trade was not the only slave trade from Africa, although it was the largest in volume and intensity. As Elikia M'bokolo wrote in Le Monde diplomatique:

&gt; ""The African continent was bled of its human resources via all possible routes. Across the Sahara, through the Red Sea, from the Indian Ocean ports and across the Atlantic. At least ten centuries of slavery for the benefit of the Muslim countries (from the ninth to the nineteenth) ... Four million enslaved people exported via the Red Sea, another four million through the Swahili ports of the Indian Ocean, perhaps as many as nine million along the trans-Saharan caravan route, and eleven to twenty million (depending on the author) across the Atlantic Ocean.""

&gt; According to John K. Thornton, Europeans usually bought enslaved people who were captured in endemic warfare between African states. Some Africans had made a business out of capturing Africans from neighboring ethnic groups or war captives and selling them. A reminder of this practice is documented in the Slave Trade Debates of England in the early 19th century: ""All the old writers ... concur in stating not only that wars are entered into for the sole purpose of making slaves, but that they are fomented by Europeans, with a view to that object."" People living around the Niger River were transported from these markets to the coast and sold at European trading ports in exchange for muskets and manufactured goods such as cloth or alcohol. However, the European demand for slaves provided a large new market for the already existing trade. While those held in slavery in their own region of Africa might hope to escape, those shipped away had little chance of returning to Africa.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/n31b18/cartoon_1930/gwnwsqs/,BroaxXx,1619964968

&gt; Pope Clement VI in 1335 addresses to King Stefan Dušan and request him to stop the persecution and that to the bishop of Kotor which is responsible for Roman Catholic Diocese of Trebinje return monasteries, churches, islands and villages, which some kings of Raška before him overtook.[34]

&gt; Serbia under Dušan claimed its identity through Orthodoxy, and opposition to Catholicism.[37] Catholics were persecuted, especially Catholic Albanians.[37][38][39]

&gt; Influenced by the clergy, Dušan showed extreme severity towards Roman Catholicism. Those who adopted the Latin rite were condemned to work in mines, and people who propagated it were threatened with death. 


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gra%C4%8Danica_Monastery

&gt; Gračanica was constructed on the ruins of an older 13th-century church of the Holy Virgin, which itself was built on the ruins of a 6th-century early Christian three-naved basilica. 

Gracanica is also one of many examples. So we have this anti-catholic policy - Serbian Empire pushing hard for their state religion, founding many monasteries on the foundation of older religious facilities, after destroying many.

Equating racially-based genocides of the Nazi regimes with Stalin’s undeniable murders and mass incarcerations of political enemies is at least as problematic as ascribing Stalin’s crimes to communism. 

Equating ideology that has equality as its main goal with the one that advocates racial purity and genocide is logically untenable and hypocritical. The only ideology, besides Nazi-fascism, that throughout the 19th and much of the 20th century used racism as a way to justify its crimes, was capitalism. Countless crimes – mass murders, genocide, and deportations – were committed, based on ideas of social Darwinism and inferiority of African, Asian, or Native American populations, all in the name of progress and gaining capital in the age of imperialism.

Virtually no leftists – be they communists, social-democrats, anarchists, democratic socialists or any other kind – deny or whitewash the crimes of Stalinism, or take Stalin’s Soviet Union as their role model. ",Dalmatia,/r/europe/comments/n3325i/76_years_ago_a_peasant_from_georgia_named_meliton/gwnjhd8/,ManusTheVantablack,1619958103

5887,"&gt; Which constitutional right do you have that ranks higher than the freedom of movement/to assemble anyone else gets? Honestly curious.

Protection of life and bodily integrity of the rest of the population. After all, that's the reasoning given for the Corona restrictions. You're acting as if protests aren't possible right now, which simply isn't true. There are protests all the time, but people largely follow the hygiene guidelines. Even the far left protests/riots in Berlin managed to largely comply with restrictions. That's not the case in regards to many anti-lockdown protesters (not all, as groups Munich for example have showed it's possible to oppose lockdowns while still respecting the guidelines).

&gt; If the complaint is too many people are too close together, then the very same rules apply to any other protest, do they not? BLM has had the biggest crowds in 2020, no one gave 2 shits about hygiene measurements. That's the point you wilfully ignore. Unless the virus knows best and is hella progressive to not infect poc crowds.

When those protests happened the incidence rates were quite low and the organizers called for people to respect distances and mask wearing. Back then there were also large anti-lockdown protests without such a crackdown by police, even though those people actively encouraged others to break the hygiene guidelines. Yet it's not last summer anymore where incidence rates were low - just to put in context:

**When the BLM protests happened (06.06.2020), incidence rates were around 3. Now the incidence rate is at 150. That's 50 times the amount of infections** ([or visualized](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1192085/umfrage/coronainfektionen-covid-19-in-den-letzten-sieben-tagen-in-deutschland/)). That's the reason why courts currently often disallow anti-lockdown protests and why the police cracks down harder on them by now - they have shown repeatedly not to respect basic hygiene guidelines and the situation right now is far worse.",Hesse (Germany),/r/europe/comments/n2m9a3/anti_lockdown_protests_in_brussels_right_now/gwnjk5h/,MilkaC0w,1619958142

5900,"I think people forget the definition and point of reparations.  The point is to settle any past debts owed by the two sides to the other as part of the process of peace and unification.

The dissolution of the North Cyprus government and integration into a unified Cypriot government (with assurances against unification with either Turkey or Greece), along with the removal of Turkish troops, the ending of the UN task force in the buffer zone, and more would all be done in negotiations that would likely include reparations from Turkey or North Cyprus.

How much and who exactly from and how collected would be questions, but disbursement is usually done by a fund that would allow the receiving side (the Cypriots) affected by the wrongs to fill out some forms to claim a percentage of the whole amount received as reparations.  Claim applications would be taken for an amount of time (usually at least a year), an accounting of claims and payouts based on that would be made, inevitably challenged in court, and then payouts would be made.

Heck, the US embargo on Cuba is tied to a requirement for reparations for property seized in the revolution and we’ve done all that accounting for how gets what percentage of the reparations decades ago. To end the embargo would just take the US and Cuba to agree on an amount and Cuba to offer an apology. You can even buy shares of the reparations pot as a speculative interest if you think that the negotiations will happen and be successful. They’re worth literally pennies now because the expectation is that it won’t happen or the final amount will be tiny, but they are an interesting thing to say you own.",,/r/europe/comments/n2mqoe/on_this_day_in_2004_cyprus_became_a_full_member/gwn56n0/,Nutarama,1619950440

Take a look at [this video](https://youtu.be/uMdXe8s8Qw8) and compare the gradual US growth with the EU's rollercoaster!

I'd say look at GDP PPP data to get a feel if your economy is growing. *Then* look at real GDP to see how highly your economy is currently ""valued"". The whole EU economy has been undervalued for a while but not dramatically so. It might change soon depending on whether America took on a little too much debt and if the dollar might tank or not.

China is undoubtedly the number 1 economy right now and it's terrifying. Their industrial sector is larger than the EU + US together. Their economy is also massively undervalued. Have you ever heard of the fact that the Chinese hold a lot of US debt? They do that to drive an artificial demand of USD to devalue their own currency which in turn is good for exports.

&gt;Don't know how long you'll be staying, but the summer (once it arrives,  if it arrives) is pretty nice for a short while. White nights/no sunset,  depending on where you are (it's a big country), is quite different to  the NL too.

I moved here permanently, girlfriend is Finnish, so it was either Finland or the Netherlands, and at least in Finland we have a hope of ever buying a house lol. We're currently living on the coast in Varsinais-Suomi. I actually was in Lahti last midsummer, when it was like 30+C, I really enjoyed it.

If your only two options are do nothing or ethnic cleansing, ethnic cleansing is never the right one.

&gt; Geopolitics isn't about feelings.

I strongly disagree. Geopolitics is almost exclusively about feelings. In this case the feelings are anger, hatred and wish for revenge. Because revenge is what we're talking about here. Because you're not rightfully taking your land back, you're taking it from people who never did anything to you, their grandparents did.
