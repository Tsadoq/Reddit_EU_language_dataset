Imagine entire system regarding everything science and higher education changes within a year. That means changes in titles (want a doctorate? well, fuck you now you have a deadline you're unlikely to meet, other titles also are involved), massive movement in employment at Universities (again, imagine entire system being completely reogranized from scratch, most already started layoffs and that will hit overdrive around March-June). That will especially hit the so-called ""sieroty po dyscyplinach"", basically people who don't fit the mold of new structures that will be cut out for one reason or another (fun fact: ministry claims it's ""not a problem, nobody has to worry"", meanwhile reality is somewhat different). That will trickle down to students as well, recruitment for next year will look drastically differently than it looked last year, those already in will see massive changes in quotas as well as student contracts. As far as science goes, again people will be laid off that are involved in major projects, a lot of projects will get their funding cut and as far as new projects go you can expect freeze for year or two until situation stabilizes itself.

For my specific field, that is medicine, you can expect effective stop to any and all scientific activity thanks to new rules regarding doctorates (AKA why exactly would I waste my time in doctoral school making it impossible for me to get specialization and get living wage for several years again?). There will be literally no incentive for physicians to get involved in any kind of research at all. 

As far as specific topics of medicine: NPOZP is being completely ignored, but that's not even close to geriatrics. That's where entire Ministry literally ignores it even exists which mind you is fairly annoying especially with tiny issue of ageing population being what it is. And while you might think that:

&gt;Welcome to Poland, it's like this in every field.

... that really wasn't the case during PO rule. Sure, Kopacz was (and is) an idiot, and Arłukowicz arrogance is vast... but neither literally ingored the ""expert panels"" as it happens now. Similarly as much as Kurdycka and Kolarska-Bobińska were inactive not all reforms are good... and again while I actually agree that ""Higher education and science"" needed reform, we went wrong way.

Fun story: his highness Minister Gowin tried to ... escape his own fucking bill and get habilitation at UJ before it comes into full force. Luckily he failed, and quite frankly I'm surprised he actually wasn't lynched considering what the issues are and how pissed entire UJ upper echelon is. Another fun fact, a lot of people from PiS circles including Gowin come from private sector in higher education... guess who gets subsidies and basically only profits from the whole debacle... Yup, private universities. God save us all if that's what we're supposed to rely on.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/amit4a/top_10_countries_with_the_fastest_shrinking/efn04zl/,Fresherty,1549168292

30,"OK, let's say for the sake of argument you were an MEP. You are a British conservative. You campaigned on fiscal responsibility, fairness, personal responsibility and you like some parts of the EU but hate others. 

Now, Conservatives are in an EU parliamentary group. If MEPs want to have more influence and money for political activities, they need to join an international Parliamentary group. Think about them as EU level parties. So you belong to a British political party, and your British political party belongs to a European party. 

Let's say the British conservatives told you to vote NO, because fuck the EU, they're already leaving. Let's say your EU Parliamentary group told you to vote NO, because you had a party meeting before the vote. There are 40 members in your Parliamentary group. 30 of them have shady dealings or are from corrupt countries. Those 30 command everyone to vote NO, and tell the 10 of you that they will cut funding to others from the EU Parliamentary group if you vote YES.

So you were told 2 times to vote NO by your parties. You know that there will be serious consequences if you don't vote NO. But you want to vote YES because you don't hate the EU and you think the law is fair (, and you campaigned on these ideas to get elected). 

If there's no secret ballot, you vote NO and don't represent your voters, because you believe that the issue is not important enough to make your British and EU parties angry with you.

If there's a secret ballot, you vote YES, because the leaders of your parties don't know how you vote.

Also, the way you describe ""communists like you"" would rather look like social-democracy.

A lot could be debated about wether *we enter a post-scarcity era*. The necessary efforts to curb global warming, and the forseable depletion of petroleum reserves and other natural resources,  would rather point toward an era, if not of abrupt scarcity, at least of reduced abundance. This, coupled with a galloping global demography and unprecedented accumulation of wealth by a few, would indeed *lead us toward increasing authoritarian and oligarchic rule*. A lot could be said about democracy being powered by fossil fuels.

Essentially it works like this:
Wolves in Germany and most European countries are protected by law, that means you can’t hunt them or anything like that without being punished. 

Now there are those hybrid Wolves that are not protected by law, it’s the opposite. To save the wolf’s the government doesn’t want them to interbreed with dogs so they stay pure wolves. 

The thing now is, that wolves tend to hunt prey and occasionally that prey is a sheep or a cow that is owned by a farmer. Now if that farmer has a dead animal laying in his farm he wants to know weather it was a wolf or a dog-wolf hybrid, because there is a lot of official stuff that depends on those facts.

Thanks for explaining I was just really confused about that company stuff (and to be honest I still am a little, are you saying you work in a capacity that has the job to determine what is a wolf and what is a hybrid? ).
I know about the problem with hybrids and about the discussion if they should be shot or not afaik for now they are being shot (like in 2017) or they try to catch them but it doesn't always work out. 

I understand what you are saying if indeed we had lots of wolf hybrids and they would kill farm animals it would only further complicate the relationship people have towards wolves because it's not sure if they get compensation for the killed animals (but afaik at the moment they do, please correct me if I am wrong... but then again there has not yet been a case of a hybrid killing live stock). 

The last assessment I have read says that atm there is no increased dangers of the population of wolf hybrids rising: 

(Translated with deepl) 

*In fact, the danger of new hybrid beings currently does not seem to be great. Almost everywhere wolves are now only found as a pair or as a pack and as long as the animals find wild partners, their interest in dogs is low, say researchers and authorities. According to current monitoring, a single female wolf, which just a year ago crossed a territory in eastern Lower Saxony, has apparently moved on or died. And even in Ohrdruff, where the she-wolf still lives without a wolf partner, there are currently no signs of new offspring, according to the Federal Forestry Office.*

That team didn't go there to teach or to enforce their ideas, but when you are in an economic relationship with a country (and you depend on that country to uphold their part), you need to make sure things are going fine on their end.

 But what if, say that nation has multiple languages, or is one of a few nations where the language originated, or more controversially that the people who speak that language in certain places only due to repression of their own one historically.

Eg. German qually emerged from Austria and most Switzerland as Germany, Where did it originate exactly??

Or say Ireland now speaks English majoritly, but this is due to centuries of cultural oppression by Britain, should the Fins who speak Swedish have to identity as Swedish when clicking. Etc.

No physical retail business can survive on less than 10% margins, so the only reasons that they would be willing to sell popular products at such cut‐rate prices are to lure in customers with the promise of artifically low pricing. This helps the 'popular' brands in an unfair way: they end up gaining sales simply due to the fact that they are already the most popular brand in their product category. This in effect makes large brands larger not due to competition, but due to a market distortion.

Kazakhstan doesn't look very successful. Anyway, it doesn't matter - until 2014 Ukraine was very pro-russian and it wasn't good for our economy, as you can see from the graph.

&gt; Poland and Czechia are definitely wealthier than Belarus and Kazakhstan at this time, but they received substantial financial assistance after joining EU.

For many Ukrainians European direction is the natural way to get from Russian influence which can only destroy the country. What is important is not actual EU membership, but quality of life, human rights, freedom - the things which neither Russia nor its satellites have or ever had.

258,"&gt; You also promised to implement an Irish language act similar to Gaelic and Welsh legislation in Scotland and Wales. 

Yes, because it's a devolved power...

&gt;This didn't happen, even in the periods when it came under WM control

Because the UK broadly avoided legislating on areas of devolved competency or controversy even when it was forced to re-establish direct rule. I'm not sure that it would be seen as being in the spirit of the GFA to legislate in that way, even where it seems incredibly stupid that Stormont hasn't (so on an Irish Language act, or indeed on the applicability of the The Abortion Act 1967).

&gt;The Home Office is still in breach, and despite being told twice by the courts to change its procedure it has, instead of changing its modus operandi, challenged the previous two rulings and brought it to a higher court within the UK.

Huh, you are right, it is being appealed, I thought the Home Office had accepted the last tribunal ruling. But either way, that is the correct process, and if the Home Office loses the appeal then it will have to modify its position (and if it doesn't lose on appeal then from the UK perspective, the GFA hasn't been breached..).

&gt;And if you can't be trusted to ""correctly implement"" a nice simple part of the treaty, how can you be trusted to do far more complex things like figure out how to make a seamless border, as the UK promised to do.

It's really not a simple question, it mixes a whole slew of issues, including definitions of residency and the interplay between EU and UK visa requirements..  You make it sound like someone was denied citizenship, bit it wasn't was it? I think I'd come down on her side, but I'm not sure whether that's right legally.

&gt;There is no trust left to be truthful, and after the relations between Ireland and the UK hit a high point in 2014 this is incredibly sad.

￼Well what do you want to do then? 

If you don't trust the UK to stick to a deal then presumably you'd prefer not to see a UK/EU deal. Fair enough, but the UK and Ireland are still going to have to cooperate on cross border issues and figure out a way of managing the border.

391,"&gt; Poles for some reason hate Poland. But can’t find a logial explanation.

I think inertia plays certain role. From late 18th until almost 21st century (with a short break in interwar period) the country didn't really belong to us. We were just aliens and second class citizens in it. That's where the resentment comes from. A Pole born before 1989 and maybe later will feel a weird detachment from their own country. And then after we finally got our country back, it sucked. It was poor and hopelessly behind. Poland being actually a decent place to live is like a thing of the past 10 years, maybe less. People's POVs didn't catch up.

Another thing is the constant heckling coming from the west. Poland cannot into space, go to Poland - your car is already there, and so on. Or the recent progressives' favorite - Poland is a dictatorship, hurr durr. If people, who you consider your role models, keep hating on you, laughing at you and call you names, sometimes you start believing they may be right and you start hating on yourself too.

484,"&gt;If Greeks were there then aren't they there genetically? It does not add up.

History isn't based on genetics but on historical and archeological sources and findings. Why? First of all, I have already explained why genetics is irrelevant when researching ancient history, people didn't identify by their ethnic background and that remained true until the 19th century, meaning you won't solve much if you even manage to determine the genetics of a person from their bones or other remains. Which leads to the other issue, genetics doesn't give us a clear picture of one's identity at all. A person's genetic makeup consists of a myriad genetic components. No one in the world is purely Greek or Turkish or Hungarian but a big mix of everything. So if an experiment finds out that let's say a person is 14% Portugese. That's not evidence that a certain town was inhabited by Portugese people.

534,"That is true. In my country, it's the opposite mentality for the exact same reason. 

I started by trusting people, but after getting screwed over so many times, I just don't anymore.

Here's an example: with people fixing and building stuff:

- my neighbor wanted his water pipe on roof fixed. They asked him for a sum, he agreed, they removed the pipe then said that if he doesn't give them 10 times more, they'd leave him without the water pipe and some tiles of the roof fully.

- another neighbor got a fence made. They told him the cost, came and ruined his garden, then asked him for twice as much.

- I had a leak in my roof. I called some repairers, they removed some tiles and before fixing the other tiles they said the cost is 10 times more and if I don't pay they'd leave me with missing tiles. After that, went to the police and the police said ""so what could we do anyway?"". Eventually I managed to get a detective to track them down by making a petition on the country main police site, but still only recovered part of my money. Meanwhile, some colleagues from work kept telling me that it was me at fault for this problem for trusting the repairmen, and everyone knows not to trust builders/repairmen and that I should have fought them(like, physically) when they demanded more pay (as in I, one person, as at that point was alone, fighting two guys that were armed with building instruments).

So eventually I ended not trusting them anymore. Now I take extra precautions every single time I need anything fixed that I can't fix on my own, and I generally stall fixing things because I don't like dealing with the problems I know exist.

You can't have an empire and a modern nation state. They were not Ottomanists anymore, but neither they were trying to find a modern Turkish nation. They have tried different approaches, including a weird kind of pan-Islamism+loyals which have gone with the Arab revolts if not weakened by Albanians leaving already, and then last loyal non-Muslims aside from Jews going at another direction.

715,"&gt;Except I specificaly noted that tanks and aircraft (and not only, submarines too) were developed with cooperation with Russia. pz 1 - pz 4 were birthed that way(aka the most common German tanks through the war). You can't conscruct what you haven't developed yet, and good luck starting in '33 with WW1 era technology. Source:

Development of the tanks was possible due to their cooperation with Sweden not Soviet Union.

&gt;""Preparing for war"" is not quite the correct word to describe Weimar's military and political policies. While there were certain lines of continuity between Weimar's clandestine rearmament and the Third Reich's, the latter dictatorship's motives were more aggressive in intent and comprehensive in execution.

&gt;The Weimar military, the Reichswehr, certainly did lay down long-range plans to scupper the Versailles Treaty and rearm. The Truppenamt (personnel office) operated as a de facto general staff, which the Versailles Treaty had prohibited, and its officers envisioned a rapid expansion of the military. Some of this evasion was planned via dishonest means that violated the spirit of the Treaty. For example, the Truppenamt managed its officers so that they could be rapidly promoted; eg lieutenants receiving training for a captain's job. This personnel policy meant that the Reichswehr had a massive officer base for expansion beyond the 100000 man limit set by the Allies. Other evasions were more serious breaches of the Treaty such as clandestine development of military aircraft both within Germany and the USSR. The Soviets, along with other parties like the Japanese (who were actually part of the Allied powers enforcing the Treaty), sought out German expertise in developing tanks or submarines. For their part, the Reichswehr got to keep abreast of global military technology.

&gt;But these open violations of the Treaty paled before the rearmament undertaken by the Third Reich. The Kazan tank school had provided the Germans with valuable technical experience and training, but Hitler's rearmament drive was far more beneficial to German tank development in that it actually brought tank development within Germany. Hitler's rearmament drive poured resources into weaponry that far exceeded even the wildest dreams of the Truppenamt. The late-Weimar Reichswehr had envisioned a twenty-one division post-Versailles peacetime army by 1938. Hitler envisioned a much grander army; his meetings with the military chiefs in 1933 called for the twenty-one division benchmark by 1935 and exceeding it afterwards. German rearmament proceeded after 1933 at a breakneck pace and the newly rechristened Wehrmacht struggled to meet the demands for ever-larger planned armed forces. The carefully-planned officer scheme of Reichswehr could not match this expansion. One of the problems for the peacetime Wehrmacht was there simply were not enough officers to man these new formations and the training establishment could not keep up with demand.

And the cooperation with the Soviet Union made a little impact on their tank design's as well on their military.

&gt;Christ, your ignorance is painful. Germany was unable to rearm itself, because FUCKING TREATY OF VERSAILLES - 100k army was the limit, and Germany was prohibited from purchasing or producing ANY TANKS, AIRCRAFT, OR SUBMARINES. ANY. 0 WAS THE NUMBER THAT WAS ALLOWED.

You prove my point, jeez.

&gt;The Panzerschiffe did end up being built and proved a nucleus for a future German surface fleet under Hitler. This does show that the Weimar did provide a foundation for the latter rearmament. The Truppenamt certainly did plan for an enlarged peacetime army and some nationalists floated ideas of regaining Germany's lost territories such as the Polish corridor. But formulating these ideas and putting them into practice were two different things. Weimar's rearmament was always a divisive political issue and one that was the cause of domestic squabbles. Hitler operated with the benefit of eliminating his political opposition and sidelining his allies in the German right. The Reichswehr soon found Hitler's rearmament drive to be a Faustian bargain as the Nazis gave them too much of what they wanted too quickly.

They wanted the corridor not the entire Poland, and as I say Weimar Republic didn't have a plan for a total war like Hitler did, they rearmament actions may have helped Hitler but they were insignificant when you compare the entire nazi military production.

748,"&gt;We’ve all heard about how the interests of global capital are nowadays crushing returns on labour. If you want to see what the opposite of this looks like, try investment banking.  
&gt;  
&gt;Specifically, try Deutsche Bank, which today revealed its results for the fourth quarter, which will in turn lead to further cost-cutting measures.  
&gt;  
&gt;Employees are one kind of “cost”. As Stanley Pignal at the Economist pointed out earlier, this is bank where more than a thousand members of staff earned in excess of €1m a year. Yet its return on equity (post-tax return on tangible equity) is just 0.4 per cent.  
&gt;  
&gt;In its corporate and investment bank in 2018, total compensation was €3.97bn, across total employees of 37,726. This is an average of €105,000, across a staff base the size of a small city. Deutsche Bank looks like an artist’s rendition of Thomas Piketty’s Capital, satirically twisted to present a world where, at a time of slow growth, labour benefits at the expense of capital.  
&gt;  
&gt;Compensation in the same department is down from €4.4bn in 2017, but there were more staff then (the mean was just under €107,000, so not significantly different). It was last year very similar to the level of €4.1bn in 2016. Meanwhile, since 2016, the share price has almost halved.  
&gt;  
&gt;The poor performance of Deutsche Bank shares is often cited as evidence of a failing business model. But this raises a simple question: failing for whom? From the perspective of shareholders (or global capital, as it were), the failure is clear. But from the perspective of staff, the business is providing extremely high returns.  
&gt;  
&gt;The use of profit as a metric to gauge investment banking performance misses the possibility that businesses of this kind have been somehow captured by their own labour forces, extracting resources that would otherwise flow to shareholders.   
&gt;  
&gt;When the investors who provide capital for businesses benefit at the expense of the labour force, this often shows up as returns on equity, and the business is deemed a success. When labour benefits at the expense of capital, this shows up as losses (and high salaries), and the business is deemed a failure. But these scenarios are distributional in nature, rather than clear-cut proofs of success or failure.  
&gt;  
&gt;It would be hard to build a detailed case for the exact nature of the distribution, because the labour markets in question are so complex, contingent on relationships and characterised by high educational barriers to entry. The point is obviously complicated by the partial extent to which staff themselves receive equity for their labour.   
&gt;  
&gt;But the simple fact — that a basically unprofitable business is paying its staff enormous sums — is difficult to get around. We’d be eager to read an analysis of how the specific structuring of the investment banking labour market compromises its ability to compensate shareholders. Perhaps from an analyst. At an investment bank.

Firstly VHF radars have significant problems. You can't really use them offensively because of how large they are (a necessity of being VHF because for a large wavelength you need a big antenna, and for a radar you need a bunc of them. VHF radars are too large to be mounted on fighters or even AEW&amp;C aircraft. I don't think they are even any ship mounted ones. The ""highly mobile"" sunflower radar the Russians were touting was because it only took like a day to set it up vs months. (this also makes them great targets). VHF radars also have low resolution because they use a large wavelength. You might be able to see that a stealth jet is somewhere but you can't get a weapon quality track with one at range (especially a smaller more mobile one with fewer antennas). For the most part you are also only able to detect that *something* is there but not what it is. Finally VHF radars have clutter problems. 

Also the B-2, the upcoming B-21, and the concepts for the PCA are tailless which reduces their VHF signature greatly. It won't be as small as its X-band RCS but it will be hard to detect even with VHF.

VHF radars are valuable tools against stealth but they aren't something that obsoletes it by any means.

Second yes a stealth plane still has a RCS but it still allows them to get closer and makes jamming the enemy easier since they have to get even closer to get to where they burn though the jamming.

Third I'm not two well versed in passive or distributed radars but quantum radars actually make stealth more important. This is because stealth still works against them. Quantum radars work by being able to completely ignore background noise. This makes them more effective in general (ignoring a few issues I'll mention later) but it makes them especially more effective against jamming. Namely they completely ignore it. A stealth plane will absorb and deflect the photons emitted by the quantum radar so it can't see them. But a non-stealth jet relying on jamming will be seen plain as day. Also they don't work yet and will probably have issues with being able to have enough entangled photons be able to return from a target at range. 

Fourth AESAs can use low probability of intercept radar modes. This means that they will use as little power as possible, switch between a bunch of frequencies, etc. The first part especially means that it's detection range is reduced, but it will still be able to see a 4.5th gen plane outside the range of missiles and IRSTs. Though it probably couldn't see another 5th gen outside it (seriously once China or Russia have a real 5th gen instead of just glorified 4.5 gens the F-22 needs an IRST).",,/r/europe/comments/alv461/germany_opts_against_buying_american_f35_stealth/efkwxsu/,snipekill1997,1549095185

EU gives airlines deadline for no-deal Brexit

Plan would potentially force sales of shares for carriers to stay in the air

Brussels is to give airline groups such as IAG, owner of British Airways and Iberia, a seven-month deadline to overhaul their shareholder make-up in order to retain full flying rights within the EU if Britain crashes out of the bloc without a deal next month.

The tight adjustment period for airlines, which must show they are majority owned and controlled by EU nationals in order to have full rights to fly through the continent, is outlined in revisions to a draft law seen by the Financial Times.

EU member states are broadly supporting the approach ahead of Britain’s scheduled departure on March 29.

Aviation is a closely-regulated sector that faces a double blow from Brexit, since an abrupt UK departure from the EU would disrupt not only flying schedules but the licenses that carriers currently use to operate, which are administered based on the nationality of shareholders.

Senior EU officials say the proposed seven-month grace period is coupled with exacting requirements and deadlines, which would force carriers such as IAG and Ryanair, which also has a large number of UK shareholders, to potentially trigger forced-sales of shares by non-EU investors.

Plans by airline groups to maintain existing licenses must be presented to regulators within two weeks of the draft law being adopted, which could come later this month.

“That plan shall set out, in a complete and precise manner, the measures intended to achieve full compliance with the [EU] ownership and control requirements as from the 27 October 2019 at the latest,” the draft legislation states. “Where the air carrier has not presented a plan within the [two-week] time limit, the competent licensing authority shall revoke the operating license.”

While Ryanair and Luton-based easyJet say they have contingency plans in place to ensure 50 per cent of their shareholders are EU nationals, potentially by using forced sales of shares, IAG has been reticent in explaining its proposals to cope with a no-deal Brexit.

Independent estimates suggest IAG faces the biggest challenge of all, with some analysts putting its current EU ownership as low as 25 per cent.

Brussels has warned IAG its favoured plan to continue flying freely around Europe would not comply with EU laws, according to senior officials.

At a press conference on Friday, IAG chairman Willie Walsh declined to comment on the work IAG was doing with its Spanish airlines to make them ready for Brexit. He added that he expected the UK and EU to reach “a comprehensive agreement” on Brexit.

An IAG spokesperson said the group was “confident” they would comply with EU ownership rules post-Brexit.

José Luis Ábalos, Spain’s minister of public works, told parliament this week that Iberia and other airlines were “working intensively” to adjust their ownership and control structure to be ready for Brexit.

The enforcement arrangements for the EU’s airline ownership rules are part of a package of emergency laws that aim to keep basic transport services running if Britain leaves without a deal next month.

Spain, France, Finland and Poland led calls to offer far more generous arrangements for hauliers and airline groups, so levels of disruption were reduced in the aftermath of a no-deal Brexit. Spain particularly called for a more relaxed approach to enforcing airline ownership rules.

By contrast the European Commission has pursued a less forgiving approach, arguing future negotiations with Britain would be undermined by offering single market benefits to UK transport groups in a no-deal scenario, even for a temporary period.

The compromise discussed by ambassadors from the other 27 member states extends more operating freedoms to cargo carriers, with a cap on flight numbers. Passenger flights are limited to point-to-point journeys, potentially causing considerable disruption for non-EU airlines operating from the UK.

French calls for hauliers to enjoy full single market rights for a limited period after Brexit was rejected by other member states.

Germany and the Netherlands were among countries calling for a more disciplined approach to contingency measures for a no-deal Brexit, according to a diplomatic note of the meeting.

In its original proposal, the commission avoided giving airlines a period to adjust. At this week’s meeting it noted “the concerns” of several member states over airlines’ ownership and control, including Spain, France, Cyprus, Hungary and Ireland. But EU officials noted “we should not give an uncompetitive advantage to those which did not plan in advance”.

The seven-month deadline was described by officials as a way to “to bring [airlines] in line with the ownership regulations” in a fair way, since the carriers would need to submit their restructuring plans before Brexit occurs.

It can accelerate decently even at mach 1.6 but as it gets faster than that it would start to have issues with the air going into the engine that would either damage it or cause it to lose power (I don't actually know which it would be and those are really the only two options for what could happen). 

The advantage is lacking a splitter plate gives it better stealth and no moving parts means one (well two) less things to maintain. Also I think there might be drag advantages? I'm not sure on that.

Though I haven't heard about it getting a new intake and suspect its bogus.

You should also note though that the F-16 probably might not even be able to go mach 1.6 unless its clean or nearly so (the F-35 can carry 4 (and in the future 6) long range air to air missiles internal aka not really any extra drag (there will be a little because it will have to carry a little more weight).

1152,"&gt; You can claim that the scale of this was smaller than what the Nazis did, but the matter of fact is that the Soviets captured and executed 100,000+ Polish men in a targeted act of mass killing 

...unlike Third Reich, which captured and killed by order of magnitude more with outright intent of exterminating all. Which is the fact you keep dancing around while pretending it isn't there.


&gt; you could claim that the USSR prevented the Nazis from fulfilling Generalplan Ost

Which is widely accepted fact. **Hitler didn't failed at that plan because he decided to out of the goodness in his heart. He was stopped. By Red Army.** It does not change anything about previous and later acts of 

&gt; where the only criteria was a Polish sounding last nam

Outright lie. All the relevant orders containing criteria were made public after the fall of Soviet Union, so what's the point of this lie? See below.

&gt; they were content with outright killing of Polish people on the territory of the USSR only?

Careful lack of quantifier in this sentence makes it obvious that itis intended to mislead. They killed SOME Polish people and **limited themselves** to SOME of them - on the criterion of who they estimated would resist their rule (with quite a quite wide margin on the side of effective subjugation).

&gt; No, that's not what happened. The USSR stopped subjugating Polish people because it was about to collapse and was not in position to violently subjugate anyone anymore.

Tell ma all about those millions murdered by Soviet Union in between 1960s and 1980s in Poland, I'm very interested in your alternative universe. In this one there were no mass murders on that scale (and even on a scale four orders of magnitude smaller) in that time period. Face the facts. **They violently took power and once they felt secure in it the scaled down with violence a lot.** Unlike Germans, who violently conquered and exterminated for the sake of extermination. Any attempts at building equivalence between these two is cowardly manipulation and obvious whitewashing of Third Reich. Which, as I said, is something closet-nazis love to do.

&gt; I certainly can and I don't find the difference relevant in the slightest to the original discussion. 

Suddenly the difference between being alive (but subjugated) and not existing is irrelevant? Well, lets ask people who does not exit because their would be grandparents weren't send to Siberia but murdered according to Generalplan Ost.

I'll ignore your attempts of misdirecting the discussion toward general opinion about Soviet Union and your misrepresetation of my statements (by outright lies like _""and that should somehow make me forget that the Soviets invaded us in 1939"")_ and ask the real question: Tell me, **honestly, how many Polish people do YOU think would be still alive in Poland if Red Army didn't kicked Germans out of Poland?

During the proceedings, the government of Gibraltar used the UN decolonisation list to argue that it should be treated as “separate and distinct” from the UK when it came to applying EU gambling laws.

I'm going to visit a couple friends over the upcoming New Year Holiday.  First friend?  Her grandparents live in a small village in the countryside.  They grew up hungry; they now have appliances, electricity, and a full fridge.  My friend?  She's working at a tech startup, has a Master's from an Ivy League, and has been to around 40 countries.

The friend I'm visiting after?  Similar story.  All around me, I see people whose parents faced starvation, political turmoil, and lived in poverty now living middle-class lives, with international travel.  Their parents have access to health care (though it can be expensive; this is one reason Chinese save like crazy), everyone has smartphones...

Oh, and thanks to investments in high speed rail, metro systems, and other infrastructure, everyone can get around.  Plenty of chances for international travel and shopping sprees.

At the same time, nominal income obviously matters for capital goods important as well as for discretionary spending, i.e. someone wants to buy a new smartphone or hardware to his computer or maybe take a vacation. 

But don't forget, the *vast* majority of people's spending is domestic economy services and food + rent, where PPP is much more relevant. So you're wrong to claim it's misleading.

Accusation asked for compensation and was refused by the judge who thought the use of baton was reasonable in context. Hope they manage to condemn the worst offenders. However the main responsibility belongs to Rajoy's government which managed the situation in the worst possible way and jeopardized everyone's interests with his ineptitude, on top of being stupid enough not to avoid physical police action when he could have just ignored the whole thing and nothing notable would have happened. He didn't face any consequences for that other than losing his minority government to a no confidence vote.

What doesn't seem all that true is this: *hundreds of injured civilians facing long term consequences.* I have also seen these claims, but if the numbers of seriously injured were that high, they would have been shown.

1354,"You seem confused on the whole thing so I'm going to lay it out simply.

The border has little to nothing to do with migration control. Given that a) the common travel area exists  and b) the UK has a longstanding policy of visa free travel with many developed countries, there's no reason to expect that we'd attempt to use a huge land border as a control point for immigration. Rather, we'd use the existing system of requiring passport/visa checks when renting or buying housing and applying for jobs or benefits. If EU citizens are so desperate to get out of the EU that they want to come to the UK illegally over the Irish border to be homeless and jobless, then that's a matter for the police to deal with (which shouldn't be hard, rough sleepers are pretty visible).

The border is necessary, however, for the purpose of customs controls on goods, since the WTO requires that in the absence of a free trade agreement, whatever conditions are given to the most favoured nation must be given to everyone else too. So if Ireland and the UK were to de-facto allow tariff free, unregulated movement of goods between the EU and UK without those two parties having an FTA in place, then all other WTO members could demand equally preferential treatment (meaning all EU and UK tariffs would effectively go to zero, and every EU FTA would be voided as the other party could get better access to the EU market without having to give any access at all to their own, while the UK would be similarly unable to negotiate FTAs since they would have nothing to offer.)

There were plenty of white liberal Americans claiming how offensive Disney's Coco was to Mexicans when it first game out, except Mexicans generally loved it and it went on to become the highest grossing film ever in Mexico.

There are also a very small number of Mexicans who might be offended because (a) speaking Spanish is a reminder of the European subjugation of their native ancestors or (b) assuming that all Mexicans only speak Spanish is an insulting assumption that they aren't intelligent enough to speak a second language.

Basically American politics has reached the point that there is very little you can say about Mexicans without offending someone.

It would also be similar to attaching the Union Jack to the USA, since independence of Spanish colonies was carried out by the ruling colonists who seeked emancipation.

1501,"Having listened to the Brexiters for the past 4 to 5 years, the recurrent refrain that keeps on coming up is that the UK has enough leverage to get everything it wants from the EU. This is being repeated ad nausea by the leaders and supporters of Brexit, even though it is clear that the EU will not compromise the integrity of the single market to protect its trade with the UK. Why don't they understand this?

Anyways, trade will go on even with tariffs. Once companies know what the tariffs are, they will adjust their planning accordingly, even if trade drops by some percentage points. What is damaging is the uncertainty. The damage to the supply chain will also be considerable, which will mean that many UK companies will relocate part of their operations to the EU.

The Taoiseach De Valera signed Hitler's condolence book but during the war helped even though they were neutral helped the allies with information, usage of Irish airspace and more

&gt;They are hostile to NATO.

Ireland's part of the NATO partnership of peace and Euro Atlantic partnership council and regularly cooperates in humanitarian and peacekeeping missions

&gt;They just passed a bill boycotting Jews for daring to live in a disputed territory, that they were ethnically cleansed from 70 years ago by Jordan

Again wrong wow Ireland just passed a bill boycotting goods produced on ALL territory that is considered occupied by the UN which Israel possess and calling Israel ""jews"" is kinda reductive either that or you think Ireland will boycott an entire religion which is hilarious and are you saying Jordan ethnically cleansed jews 70 years ago what?

&gt;Irish media is openly anti-semitic and hostile to the west. 

Nope just plain false and I find it ironic that a Brit is criticising the media of other countries

&gt;20,000 net immigration a year is not much compared to the way the Irish talk about supporting refugees and calling anyone who doesn't racist.

Any look at the writings of the early Young Turk intellectuals says as much from their own words (Ziya Gokalp perhaps exemplary). 

The presence of Armenians and other Christian minorities in Anatolia was an obstacle in creating a pan-Turkist state, as they couldn't be rapidly Islamised and therefore Turkified in the same way that Kurds could. The invasion of the Russian Empire was the necessary pretext to carry out the deportations, but Armenians were targeted deep into Anatolia, pretty much uniformly across Central Asia, and in parts of western seaboard like Izmir and Istanbul too. Women, children, and men who had no association whatsoever with Armenian nationalists were ""temporarily"" deported, yet their property was summarily confiscated and were still killed in the hundreds of thousands.

1639,"&gt;Instead of posting a map please support your colonization theory

It's not a theory, it's a common fact that ancient Greeks founded many cities and settlements o the Aegean coast in Anatolia. That's the reason why the region was called Ionia, it had a lot of ionic Greek settlers.  In addition they also founded settlements in the Bosphorus and on the Black Sea coast of Anatolia. 

Ephesus was one of the first and largest greek colonies, it was founded sometime in the 10th century BC.

&gt;genetics

That's not really relevant as people in the ancient world didn't identify by ethnic background, but by cultural traits. If you worshipped Greek gods, if you knew how to speak in Greek and if you had the same cultural, traditional characteristics (that could have been adopted) then you were Greek. They didn't care whether your dad or your great great grandmother was ethnically Greek or not, which is why bringing up genetics is baseless.

&gt;I can also post a map of colonization of Africa and say that Africa was full of French and English colonizers.

Some parts of Africa were, you'd have to be more specific, similarly I didn't say that entire Anatolia was full of Greek colonists. For example South Africa had quite many English people while Algeria had a lot of French colonists.

Beyond that I'm seriously concerned that a country like Germany would consider such an old airframe in this acquisition. Sure there are modernized versions, but in a world that's increasingly headed towards drones how much sense does it make? On the other hand I guess it makes no difference even if it is an F-35 if an S-500 can readily shoot it down, and there is no guarantee it can't. Europe seriously needs to invest into cruise missiles and anti-missile weaponry, and cheap fighters like the Gripens might be reasonable while we wait as ""stealth"" fighters like F-35 go through their teething problems.

Once in power in Warsaw he increased the number of roundups (łapanka) of Polish citizens and the number of hostage executions. Every day lists were hung in public announcing the names of the next Poles to be executed in the event of any attack on a German soldier or police officer. These notices were always signed anonymously by the ""Commander of the SS and Police at Warsaw District"".""

Detained persons were usually transported to Pawiak, from where they were sent to concentration camps or were shot at various points in Warsaw . Frank's regulation simplified the penal procedure, allowing ad hoc tribunals of the Security Police to immediately adjudicate on the death penalty - without the participation of the accused and without court proceedings .""*

1789,"&gt; otoh everybody who would try to claim that antisemitism is a non-factor in all of this is either a knobhead or a liar.

Obviously. But I don't think it's very high on the list of factors. After all, antisemites are in the minority in Europe, especially when it comes to those who actually wield political power and the money to influence the decision of Eurovision.

&gt; I just think it is a curious, if not suspicious phenomenon that the level of expectations directed towards Israel is much higher than that directed to Palestine and the other countries of the region while the latter tend to receive far more lenicy than Israel does.

Again, I'm in no way very knowledgeable on the subject, but in my understanding, the Israeli government is a lot more stable and controlling than the chaotic mess in Palestine where terrorist groups roam and wield power. The Palestinian state is a lot more loose of a concept than the Israeli one, which means you cannot criticise a single entity for the problems. Obviously, nobody likes Hamas, but it's clearly evident that they're relevancy is kept alive by the Israeli government. The more the Israeli government fights against Palestinian autonomy and commits atrocities against Palestinian civilians, the more Palestinians will turn against the Israeli government and support Hamas or other Palestinian militia groups in anger against Israel.

The way I see it, it's a spiral of evil and destruction that is fueled by what the Israeli government does against Palestinian civilians. There is only one way to make the area peaceful, and that way starts with the Israeli government.

&gt; Like in lots of countries in the region Jews are either officially persecuted, or inofficially persecuted, or have been pushed into hiding or out of the country for the most part. In contrast the Palestinians and other Muslims living in Israel are enjoying equality and freedom at least for the most part. If someone expresses extensive criticism of Israel while not also showing comparable effort to do the same towards Israels neighbours then that's just applying a heavy double standard towards Israel.

That's a valid point, and I partly agree and disagree. I think you're missing some very important context. The way Jews are mistreated is what I would view as an indirect method of ""getting at"" the Israeli government. You can't do that against Palestinians because there is no formal central regime. Secondly, you need to keep in mind that Israel is a country formed largely of Jewish immigrants. There was no Israel until about 100 years ago. The Jewish settlers replaced the Palestinian population and forced most of them to move. Again, this is where my lack of knowledge on the topic comes back to bite me, but from my understanding, this was not a very peaceful and democratic process, and it occurred rather rapidly. The Zionist Jews immigrated to the area, took control of it, formed a government, and later declared independence. It's not hard to see why that would cause resentment towards the Israeli government and its leaders and supporters.

Obviously, I would never condone atrocities committed against any population, and as a result, I do condemn what happens to Jews on a daily basis in and around Palestine. But it also quite clear to me, despite my limited knowledge (or maybe partly because of), that this happens mostly as a result of past and present Israeli aggression, both politically and militarily, and not as a stand-alone act of antisemitism.

&gt; That's not the case just because every other host country was totally cool and nothing serious was there to even criticise. E.g. the contest was held in the UK a few times in the timespan of the conflicts in Northern Ireland. Or the one in Russia about a decade ago.

None of those examples involves conflicts of similar scales, and dare I say severity. Another thing to note is that actively supporting the existance of Israel can result in more fuel on the fire from Hamas and other militant groups. That doesn't really happen with cases like Russia or UK during The Troubles.

&gt; Well, as this is about a bloody music contest that's there (among other things) to bring us all a bit closer together and hopefully be more friendly towards each other

Absolutely. But this could also been seen in a different light of acceptance towards Zionism and rejection of a Palestinian state. By its very nature, it is a political statement whether or not it is direct or indirect.

A way to get around this would be to create a Palestinian contestant that can also participate in Eurovision. If we're all for bringing each other more together and to be more friendly towards each other, surely Israel would have no problem with this?

Hint: Israel would likely boycott Eurovision if that was to happen. It's the exact same sentiments that drive the opposition to let Israel host Eurovision, just in the opposite direction. If you can understand why Israel wouldn't accept a Palestinian contestant, why wouldn't you see the problems associated with letting Israel host Eurovision?",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/algjb6/stars_urge_bbc_to_ask_for_eurovision_to_be_moved/efjbypc/,DirtyPoul,1549045096

If we keep importing new 'bad examples' the currently residing 'good examples' will keep getting drowned out.

This is especially bad when it comes to girls, who are doing well in school and socially, but are still kept controlled in the ghettos and aren't allowed to have a social life on par with the boys. It's against the very foundation our society is built upon and we should not tolerate it, but we do because we're afraid of 'disrespecting culture'. Our culture is BETTER, we need them to come on board, instead of recreating the shit-show they fled.

Freedom of speech and equal opportunity are things we must hold sacred and we must teach them that this is foundational to our success, and why we were able to take them in.

The divide in opinion in the UK not about whether to shit on Ireland or not, it's about whether to put up a fight with the EU. Yes of course a lot of this is fueled by ""Rule Britannia"" overconfidence, but no-one here in their right mind thinks we are going to start exerting authority over other countries. The reality is, most people on the street in the UK would be perfectly OK with a unified Ireland. That is completely contrary to the perception you have about our empirical aspirations. The Common Travel Area is 100% not up for debate, because the Irish are considered our closest friends in Europe (despite the shit in NI). My point is, the backstop was not a huge issue until the DUP vetoed the withdrawal agreement, specifically over that issue. We were happy to draw a line at the Irish Sea. No-one in England thinks the DUP should be yielding this sort of power, and it's entirely Theresa May's fault because she needs them to prop her up. None of what is going on with the border has anything to do with English views on the Irish, and is entirely to do with the unprecedented influence of the DUP.

The problems we see NOW aren't indeed.

But the biggest problem in the long term IS very much the idea itself: leaving the EU is retarded.

Not because the EU is oh-so-great, but simply because small countries don't matter one bit and are simply pawns on the global political stage.

And don't get me wrong: the EU still has to grow a lot to become more of an actual global player. But things the EU allows EU countries to be MUCH more in control than they would be on their own. For example: do you think the GDPR would have the global effect it had if it was passed by, for example, Tunisia?

Yes. The UK invented the steam catapult and angled flight deck.

It wasn't a problem of know how, modern aircraft are big and heavy and require a powerful catapult. That requires a nuclear powered ship. The Labour government that ordered the carriers ruled out using nuclear power plants.

There was supposed to be support for a new electric catapult (EMALS) built in to the design, but when the Conservative government tried to activate that option in 2010 it was found that the cost of modifying the ships would be prohibitive.",,/r/europe/comments/alv461/germany_opts_against_buying_american_f35_stealth/efihzpb/,WhiteSatanicMills,1549023138

I didn't argue that point because I do not agree with it. I posted because portraying Bloody Sunday as some deliberate orchestrated attack on peaceful marchers ignores the reality. The army issued orders to try to arrest rioters. As the inquiry found:

&gt;Brigadier MacLellan had delayed giving an order for an arrest operation because
he was correctly concerned that there should be separation between rioters and peaceful
marchers before launching an operation to arrest the former.

&gt;Maybe you forgot about Demetrius?

No. The state has a duty to protect citizens. When an active terrorist group begins a campaign of mass murder the state has a responsibility to stop them.

&gt;Maybe you forgot about the death squads killing people without any kind of due process?

No. The army were there to stop that. In 1969, 1970 and 1971 republican paramilitaries murdered 119 people and loyalist paramilitaries murdered 25. The police were both compromised and overwhelmed.

2160,"There's 2 reasons why this is happening: lower purchasing power and media brainwashing.

The Purchasing power in Europe has been on a steady 5-10% decrease over the last 10 years and will probably continue to decrease as soon as a new economic slump hits. For most people it's not about ""more disposable income"" because even if they pursue a career their raises are shit and their salary will never match those in the US. Which is probably why the US has a much higher birthrate than Europe: because disposable income and purchasing power is much greater than it is here.

Secondly, people have been completely brainwashed into not having kids. Half the people on this thread don't want kids because Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, 9gag, Brightside or another shit site has told them for years that kids are a pain in the ass and a complete waste of your time. Carpe diem they say, and as we all know, this generation is mostly incapable of planning for the future. It's not just kids that's the problem, but so is renting or not owning anything. Young people simply don't understand that they'll become old and decrepit, lonely, that their friends and family will die and then they'll just become lifeless husks that the state will need to take care of.

Different from the UK and the US, which basically have a two-party system, the proportional system on the continent allows for new movements to gradually move into politics over a period of time.  That allows them to adjust their position and become more realistic. The Brexites and the Trumpists had to assume government responsibility from one day to another.

I remember how radical the Greens in Germany were when they first entered parliament. Today, they are very moderate. Tsipras in Greece was very radical. Today he is best friend with the EU. Salvini wanted to split the North of Italy from Rome. Now he is in government in Rome he no longer wants to split Italy. Once he gets a stake in European politics, he will become pro-European.

The proportional representation is cumbersome since it often results in coalition governments, but in the long run it helps Europe avoid the extremes.

2212,"&gt;You are pretending that poorer people live in a little economic bubble where overall economic factors don't impact them?

Not at all, but when inflation is steady, wages are rising for the poorest people in the UK and you cite a drop in the value of the pound as having a major impact, you may not be looking at issues that are likely to have an impact on the poorest in society (indeed you've picked something that has a mixed impact at the best of times).

&gt;Investment creates jobs and opportunities. We are going to have fewer in the future.

Except employment is up not down, FDI is on an upward trend not a downward one (but after a bit of a negative spiral), internal investment looks like it has been held rather than cancelled..

&gt;We're not an export economy. A weaker currency impacts us all very directly because everything we import is going to be more expensive. That's a direct impact at the till.

We export services and finished goods. A weaker currency makes our (usually more expensive) export goods cheaper but the input (raw materials etc...) more expensive so it's a mixed bag, we are also the worlds 8th largest manufacturer and while we import more than we export, the question of 'what' is important there. And yes, it'll have an impact at the till, but when that impact is below 'normal' levels of inflation, it becomes a question of whether that impact is particularly noticeable.

&gt;Food inflation combined with wage inflation is fine. When wages, in real-terms, have been stagnant since 2009 - people can't really keep finding the money for ever-increasing prices if their wages don't keep up.
I may be incorrect but my understanding is Toshiba saw Brexit as the final nail in the coffin for this project, not withstanding any previous issues. I'm sure you are also aware that a few car plants have been cancelled, or are now due to be closed. It's just a single example, I could have used a better one.


Right, but we have had wage stagnation coupled with food inflation since 2009, it only stopped (wages outpacing inflation) this year. Trying to blame that on Brexit makes very little sense.

&gt;I think at this point a 'worst-case scenario' is extremely likely. You may feel differently.

I do, and even in that context, you ignore any mitigation.

&gt;I am not talking about branch offices and you know that :p. Banks are pulling out to Ireland and The Netherlands for the main, and also Frankfurt etc. We are losing one of the few strengths in our economy.

You are though aren't you? People aren't moving, services aren't moving, operations aren't moving.. There are more people employed in the sector than ever before, the sector is growing. Banks aren't 'moving' they are making organisational changes that make regulatory compliance easier in some cases.

&gt;I may be incorrect but my understanding is Toshiba saw Brexit as the final nail in the coffin for this project, not withstanding any previous issues.

You'd be incorrect.

&gt;I'm sure you are also aware that a few car plants have been cancelled, or are now due to be closed. It's just a single example, I could have used a better one.

As far as I am aware some manufacturers have shifted close down periods to around the exit date so that they can avoid any issues at the ports over a week or so,  there has been some deferred investment, and some decisions where the UK was in the mix wen't to other countries . The only outright closures I think related to Fords operations, and were planned well before the UK said it intended to leave the EU.

&gt;I think you'd have to be willfully blind not to see how badly many in our country are struggling. Brexit isn't going to make that better.

￼And I think you have to work quite hard to shoe horn a lot of that struggle into brexit, and of course I think leaving the EU will make things better in the future, otherwise I wouldn't have voted for it. I have spent the best part of a decade watching a huge number of very bright colleagues move to the US because EU bioscience regulation is shite, I've watched regeneration funds be misspent, I've worked with people in the EP (not Eurosceptics either..) and found it like walking through a swamp, with its own agenda and inertia that is like nothing at all in Westminster..

2220,"Maybe some one finally figured out that so called stealth - aka reduced radar cross-section - is not that miraculous thing. There are several problems with it:

* no matter how the stealth is designed it is going to be effective only against certain radar wavelengths - so it kinda needs to be designed to be elusive for certain radars which also conversely allows potential opponents to design radars which can defeat it
* reduced radar cross-section does not make the 'stealth' aircraft invisible to radar but just make it harder to detect ('smaller') - so with powerful enough radar it could still be detected (even when using the 'compromised' wavelengths)
* there are already alternative solutions coming up to defeat stealth designs, passive radar, distributed radar networks (multiple radars on different wavelengths), and IIRC even so called quantum radar so the long term usefulness may become questionable
* also stealth aircraft operating things like radar are giving out their own positions quite conveniently (pretty much like radar transponders work)

It is probably great if your plan is to engage clearly technologically inferior opponents but i would expect more modern military powers to develop (effective) countermeasures against the technologies used in F-35 in the near future. And if you compare the F-35 as a combat aircraft to others the gap between their performance may not be all that massive.

It is illigal not to employ people as indeterminated time if you are using them in that way but you do them a yerkly contract one after the other.

Many people with factories have done that because yes, you have to train a guy again, but if you do that with 10 people those were practically 70.000€ tax free.

Problem is that the statal employee pay way less then private. The INPS has a good income while INDAP was deep red. This is why Renzi merge the 2. He save the statal and the private must pay.

“Germany in recession? They have the highest trade surplus per capita in the world when you are competing for the worst.”


Do you know how simple trade or economics work? You realise that a trade surplus isn’t necessarily good or bad and isn’t an I’d cation of how good a nation is doing but moreso of how their economy is structured  right? Regardless of that how does that change the fact that both Italy and Germany are In a recession now and UK aren’t? 



“Because Brits are apathic af when French riots every others day. French actually manage to change things in the street, you're about to crash in slow-motion and nobody dare to take the wheel.”


Crash in slow motion again can you give me a citation? Because last time I checked UK is doing better than France in nearly every single quantifiable data and statistics and have had far better growth and employment with wages rising faster than France too, you realise that these protests haven’t done anything and have actually hindered Frances progression instead of helped it

Every time they turned around there was another loyalty oath to be signed. [...]

&gt;Without realizing how it had come about, the combat men in the squadron discovered themselves dominated by the administrators appointed to serve them. They were bullied, insulted, harassed and shoved about all day long by one after the other. When they voiced objection, Captain Black replied that people who were loyal would not mind signing all the loyalty oaths they had to. To anyone who questioned the effectiveness of the loyalty oaths, he replied that people who really did owe allegiance to their country would be proud to pledge it as often as he forced them to. [...]

&gt;“The important thing is to keep them pledging,” he explained to his cohorts. “It doesn’t matter whether they mean it or not. That’s why they make little kids pledge allegiance even before they know what ‘pledge’ and ‘allegiance’ means.”

It is also very expensive and not european.

The Rafale fits the same niche (except SEAD), is combat proven, carries up to 9 tons on its mounting points (not bad for a 10 ton aircraft), has an aircraft carrier version and isn't such a brick as the F-35. It is also cheaper (for now, cost depending on number of units produced). 
It is also a signal for a common european defence.

&amp;#x200B;

The Green Party guy (who hated the F-35) asked ""where are these 2 planes"", and the Air Marhsal"" said ""They're stationed in New Mexico with pilots training"". 

&amp;#x200B;

The Green Party guy was like wtf,  so the US still has the jets?  You could see the look on his face that he had no idea why the Australian Air Force would be in New Mexico. He thought it was some kind of scam where the US wasn't actually going to give Australia the planes. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the Australian Air Marshal like and the Air Force officers said the 2 Australian planes were in a training pool with 6 other US F-35s, and didn't understand why that would be weird. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, like the 2 Australian planes weren't even being just flown just by Australians, they were also flying American F-35s and Americans were flying the Australian F-35s. It was just a pool of 8 total planes so one plane would always be available with maintenance. It was just funny to see the look on this guy's face when he was like ""why the fuck do we have troops in the US?"" He had no idea how closely the US and Australian militaries actually worked together.

There are and there will be several other actors in the air battlefield than can pass your range and course to an EF through a datalink. The EF does not even need to switch on the radar to launch a meteor aim at you from a long distance.

Trache 3 can be upgraded to AESA for sure. I´m not totally sure about tranche 2, but tranche 2 can be upgraded to tranche 3, so I guess it is possible. It is tranche 1 the only one sadly not upgradeable.

EF is becoming multirole, more and more weapons are being integrated in the plane For example Germany is now integrating taurus missile. There you have spear 3 and storm shadow by UK. Plenty of GBU models. MArte ER missile by Italy.

2540,"&gt; F-35 can carry 4 long range AA missiles internally and is capable of mach 1.2 without sustained afterburner (in a few years it will be 6 internal). Eurofighter is only capable of supercruise with 4 long range AA missiles and 2 short range ones. Carry more and it can't. Plus in that state it can carry only 11020lbs of internal fuel which is 46% of its empty weight vs the same for the F-35 being 64%. 

I´m sorry but is the first time I heard that F35 is able to sustain supercruise. It needs to switch on afterburner to reach that speed unlike F22 or EF. Can you give me a link about it please?

As soon as you open the bays to launch a missile you will be in all the radars 100km around.

EF can carry external fuel tanks. F35 can too but will lose it stealthiness in this case.

&gt; New AESA isn't going to be the multiple times better it would have to be to make it able to detect F-35 first, and it won't be because its already known to have fewer T/R modules. 

I do not know if F35 can be long range detected with the future EF AESA radar as it is a X-band radar, but anyways it will improve EF capabilities.  I don't know how many modules captor-E has but I will check it out.

&gt; And the F-35 has the EOTS, but the F-35 will track the Eurofighter first and shoot it without it knowing because Pirate will only see an oncoming jet at 50nm, well within missile and detection range for F-35. 

I don´t think so. To track EF you need to switch the radar on or receive data through a datalink. Anyway EOTS is an integrated pod derivate it is not for the same purpose than Pirate. 

&gt; It will improve range but it will still be shorter ranged than the F-35 and those tanks will cut maneuverability and the LERX will improve maneuverability but not efficiency. 

Well, range is important but is not everything. Bigger planes have longer ranges but are less maneuverable. If you are going to enter in combat the tanks will be discarded. These lerx will make EF by far more maneuverable than the F35.

&gt;Version of the Meteor with shorter fins for internal carriage on F-35 is already planned for early to mid 2020s.

More baseless claims. A meeting in an office is NOT subletting. 

&gt; Spare me your talking-points-of-the-day from Nowogrodzka, srsly.

What do you mean Nowogrodzka? This is how they dubbed themselves, Nowogrodzka only acknowledged how they self-identify.

&gt; The opposition notified the State Electoral Commission (PKW) about the Law and Justice party breaking the very rules I'm talking about. 

Nowoczesna did, PO notified the Prosecution office. But back to PKW for now, be so polite and point out for example [here](https://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/tasmy-kaczynskiego-nowoczesna-sklada-wniosek-o-kontrole-w-pis,905095.html) where there is anything about illegal subletting the office. 

&gt; This is not for the prosecutor, this is for the PKW and it's already been notified, I don't need to do that again myself.

How so? You clearly said what they did (subletting the office) was illegal, PO notified the Prosecutors Office about other possible illegal actions, add on to it. Also, no - as I pointed out above Nowoczesna did not notify PKW about this ""illegal subletting"", they mainly asked for audits. Maybe read the news more closely, details matter. 

&gt; As I said, both parties are shit. Both being shit doesn't mean one of them isn't.

Never said it did, but considering what happened before, I have no reason to blindly believe their new empty accusations. Thats what I hate about this, there are plenty of reasons to criticize PiS, but there is also so much BS repeated about them that the valid criticism loses its value. 

&gt; And this makes him good or bad, because I can't follow your weird logic.

What is weird in my logic? He wants to pay someone for their work, he openly admits they deserve to be payed (which can and would be used in court if suddenly Kaczynski changed his tune), but he refuses to do it illegally. He proposed a solution to the problem. Is that really a question for you, is this good or bad? If its not clear, IMHO this is obviously a good stance to have. 

&gt; They NEED their own minions and other than PO, they also considered Śpiewak ('son of a hardcore Jewish professor', as JK referred to him) to be an obstacle. Seems like everybody's against their 100% pure business and they need their minions, after all.

Again - bullshit. You are adding on things that arent in the recordings, not for the first time either. In the recording Kaczynski said PO politicians threatened that they wouldnt allow them to build. So is the issue these PO politicians or supposed lack of PiS politicians? Spiewak commented these recordings, he is indeed against building these buildings, so how is Kaczynski wrong about him?

&gt; Yeah, that's why the business is shady: don't take any formal positions, let your driver/secretary/Beata Szydło/Mateusz Morawiecki/Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz do the paper-signing. That's his modus operandi in government and in business. TOTALLY NOT SHADY1!!!!!11!!

Nice switcharoo.  Did he break the law for not revealing his supposed role in a company (that he doesnt actually have) or you just dont like how he acts?

&gt; Oh, so whenever I want to do sth shady I should have a lawyer and that would make it not shady. Do you even hear yourself? xd

Yeah, totally better to do it 1on1 in a cemetery...

&gt; Yeah, everyone not agreeing with you quoting L&amp;J's talking points of the day is ""making things up"". Surely. Of course.

I'm Slav and my great-grandpa was killed by Nazis yet I don't (and have no desire to) track whether anybody said that Slavic casualties in the WW2 are exaggerated or if somebody denies them altogether and I sure wouldn't label the whole group as degenerate because of that. 

I don't know if your story is true, but it irrelevant in this context. The issue is the denial of generally accepted facts, which include the fact that the Holocaust happened and killed a lot of human beings and scarred the survivors. To deny this fact is to open the door for other forms of denialisms of general facts like vaccination, which cannot be tolerated.

&gt;Yeah, staying in communion is crucial and if Holocaust denial for some reason results in excommunication/schism then I don't see how and why is it worth dying on that hill. But at the same time it's pretty weird that it would result in excommunication/schism since it doesn't have anything to do with the faith to begin with.

The problem is that the Holocaust or Shoa was the biggest industrially commited genocide ever commited. The denial of such basic facts especially since they aren't theologically reasoned and thus have no excuse, the church cannot tolerate if any member of the clergy holds such public beliefs.

What I don't understand is your seeming toleration of such reprehensible human beings.

I think Churchill was fond of De Gaulle personally because he saw that De Gaulle was at heart a patriotic Frenchman who loved his country. That said, I think he quite exasperated Churchill. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The political climate of the time was volatile but french politics at  the time were on another level of volatile (the myriad of resistance  groups were fighting the germans as much as they were fighting  themselves, which is funny but in a sad way).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that De Gaulle was very smart because he was worried that communists might take over in France so he had to hurry. I don't think that was really clear to the US because they didn't understand the French political climate at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Vichy were also really hard to understand. The US initially thought the the Vichy were the legal government of France and Roosevelt tried to keep good relations with the Vichy i***n the hope that they would turn over peacefully and join the US and UK with the rest of the Free French****.* 

&amp;#x200B;

I think De Gaulle saw this and he was really insulted because he saw the Vichy as traitors and didn't understand why Roosevelt was negotiating with French traitors. While at the same time, he got really upset when the US invaded French North Africa to fight the Vichy since they would be occupying part of France (in his mind). None of it was really clear to anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But the point is about european  independance in a way allied and aligned with the US but as a separate  sovereign bloc in a way not just doing the US' bidding and De Gaulle was  largely in favor of that and later on even felt that UK was largely  just following along whatever the US said or told them to do.  
&gt;  
&gt;Which  isn't entirely wrong per say at the time, the influence the US had in  european politics at the time was massive and not many countries wanted  to risk antagonising the US considering the USSR was just next door.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah but like, this sovereign bloc didn't exist at the time. I mean, France had just had a war with Germany in the 1940s. The US itself funded Jean Monet to help create this sovereign bloc because the US in the 1940s and 1950s thought a more united Europe would be stronger against the USSR. 

&amp;#x200B;

When De Gaulle went to Germany to sign the Élysée Treaty in 1963, he originally wanted Germany to join France as a separate power bloc from the US. The West Germans said no because they had really close relations with the US and the US was doing a lot to confront the Soviets right across in East Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

De Gaulle said, after the treaty was signed

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""The Germans are behaving like pigs. They are putting themselves  completely at the Americans' service. They're betraying the spirit of  the Franco-German Treaty. And they're betraying Europe."" Later, in 1965, the General told his closest aides behind closed  doors : ""The Germans had been my greatest hope; they are my greatest  disappointment.""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lys%C3%A9e\_Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lys%C3%A9e_Treaty)

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, this was crazy. The US had 400,000 troops in West Germany at the time, which was like the entire size of the French Army. France was in no position to give as much support to West Germany as the US at the time and he was asking West Germany to abandon the US for France. That really put a bad taste in JFK's mouth, but then he saw JFK complaining and thought that itself was US meddling in European affairs. I don't think he realized at all how things looked to the US. 

&amp;#x200B;

De Gaulle was an anti-communist. The US was anti-communist. The USSR had millions of troops right next to Western Europe. We were all on the same team, we had all just fought a war together against a common enemy and we had an even more dangerous common enemy in front of us. I don't think there was a real reason to try to create this separate bloc. I think if anything, it was dangerous to Europe.

Take Money market accounts , which are very short-term loans in which businesses often park their funds. When banks were let to fail in 1930-1931 the disease in financial sector soon spread into the real world.

Imagine if a biggest bank and finanical institution in the Slovenia failed. We are talking bank runs. NLB would call in all debts(tough on economy) and also sell their assests to willing buyers obviously under market price as reserves of the bank would be wiped out.

When NLB would eventually fail, all the assets like checks written on the bank, all the loan instruments and other documents of exchange would become worthless.

Because financial sector is so connected, it would hurt literally all the banks who worked with NLB.  So now you have a chain reaction which shrinks overall supply of liquid capital in the economy.

Now the whole economy is fucked. Deflation, high unemployment, debts stay the same causing massive peoples defaults, Rich people(investors) confiscate collateral property as people cant pay their mortgages and other debts.

Apologism often has to do with fear of scandals discrediting the associated organisation and ideals. Various protestant denominations also pull believers away from the church from Brasil to China. It is a difficult time.

We are currently witnessing a time of transition as the church has to finally try and enforce canonical law, which it let slide in the past. Many abuses rest on this lack of enforcement and oversight, which has to be remedied by proper leadership, but this workup will in the short term bring up a lot of scandals. Reforms are needed as the idiom goes: ""For more things to stay the same the more things have to change.""

As for Traditionalists in general I personally think a lot of them are very conservative both in religion and politics, which influences their outlook on society. And extremely conservative politics sadly often doesn't have the introspection to realise that their policy often hurts those they should protect or the idea of good leadership.

It's very simple. In one terrorists killed people. In the other, government servants gunned down those who they were sworn to protect, and then the government swept the whole mess under the carpet.

The response to the Omagh bombings was widespread condemnation, both communities doubling down on the peace process and the Irish and British governments pushing through expedited anti terrorist legislation. The response to Bloody Sunday was the Troubles flaring up and 500 people dying in the worst year of violence of the Troubles.

2841,"Yeah, we did it with the Commonwealth, not really with Europe, that's my point. Not to dismiss the contributions of Europeans of course, just explaining reasons why I think we've always felt closer to the Anglosphere.

When you unpick national origin stories they often have many holes in them, for example:

- The USA wasn't fighting the tyrannical British, they just didn't want to pay for a war that was fought to defend them and even turned down representation when offered. Also, ""all men are created equal"" when they all had slaves?
- The Irish weren't consistently united in a fight against the UK, most of them would've been content with home rule and the Easter Rising probably wouldn't have led to much else if Britain hadn't reacted so harshly
- The liberty of the French Revolution gradually died as the republican government became more authoritarian and militaristic, yet the first word of the French motto is still ""Liberty""

But the actual history isn't really the point, it's the spirit and the legend that surrounds it. Britain did tenaciously stand up to Germany when a deal with the devil was possible, the fact remains we didn't break and should rightly be proud of our ancestors for the role they played in saving us all from a new dark age.

When people think of Blitz Spirit they obviously aren't thinking of the people who used the chaos to rape and burgle their neighbours, or those who heckled Churchill when he visited the rubble. But the endurance of the people who kept calm and carried and dug for victory, it doesn't matter if the history isn't true, it's helped strengthen protect national identity.

For example, people in favour of European Unity site desiring peace among nations who have a lot in common but were repeatedly at war with each other. I think it's fair to say we passed the point where war was possible in Western Europe a long time ago, yet the EU keeps integrating because it wants power and influence on the world stage, that's a fair desire but not really as romantic as peace, so the desire for peace is the foundation of a European identity.",Land of Hope and Glory (results may vary),/r/europe/comments/alolcr/theresa_may_will_not_be_flying_to_brussels_in/efgun5m/,MrFlatcap,1548965494

The world does not revolve around the United States. This isn't just US-backed, it's backed by most of Latin America who know more about Venezuela than you do. It's also backed by the elected National Assembly of Venezuela which won the last free election in the country before the constitution was declared null by Maduro.

Lol. Also the bomb comment references the now cliché 'fire in a crowded theatre'.

&gt; “You can’t yell ‘fire’ in a crowded theater” is one of the most commonly used First Amendment catchphrases — but does it really support exceptions to free speech? The answer to this question can be found in the writings of Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. He penned the phrase in 1919, not to justify moderate limits on speech, but to justify government prosecution of those speaking out against the draft.

It was entirely hypothetical and used to argue in favor of the persecution of those critising the Government.

Not true. Some people get upset about stupid things, that's correct. They may even call it hate speech, but that doesn't make it so. You gotta do fairly unambiguous stuff to be prosecuted for hate speech.

And what the point of protecting historical truth about the Holocaust is: People are very vulnerable to misinformation. Put a charismatic speaker in front of a microphone and let him make an argument against the Holocaust and there will be people believing it, or at least a seed of doubt will be planted. That's simply not something some countries are willing to accept. The Holocaust is a monumental lesson that we cannot forget. Imagine a Nazi Germany with atomic bombs.

The administration is doing everything possible to eliminate as soon as possible the causes of information terrorism directed against BC ""Lakhta-2"" and its tenants, including an agreement to terminate the lease with the company against which the reports of false mining are sent.

It follows from the appeal that the police initiated criminal proceedings under the article ""Knowingly false information about an act of terrorism"".

In ""Lakhta-2"" the editorial office of ""Politexpert"" was rented for about a year. The publication appeared in 2015 and was located on Savushkin Street in the same building as the ""troll factory"", RBC was investigating. 

E-mails about Lakhty-2 mines were sent to the district courts of St. Petersburg on a daily basis from January 24, except for weekends. Each time the police carried out an evacuation.

3178,"Honestly I worry for younger generations , that they have become institutionalised through political correctness in the educational system . It was suggested when China was dealing with a huge earthquake crisis , no one really knew what to do because they just used to obeying the dictates from the central communist politburo . When they had to organise on their own , they were really in trouble. That's only in opinion observation but it is as if people have lost the adventuring spirit, the cowboy spirit , the idea of self-determination , standing on your own. He's such a noble idea and makes a person feel good . I can appreciate how cozy is , layers of bureaucracy and rules and regulations . On and if anyone is bullying you or being sexist, you can report it and it gets dealt with . But the whole setup is very artificial and institutionalised . There are so many interactions which you really need to know how to be strong and tough . If you're dealing with low-level crime in your neighbourhood , or bullies or difficult situations you need to know how to stand up for yourself using your intelligence and strength, on your own 2 feet . I truly worry that we've created a week decadent generation . It wouldn't matter so much but it seems like the rest of the world is creating warriors . In eastern Europe and the Middle East people have to be so tough in order to even survive , they come to the UK and you have silly young people who are charming and soft but I just get the feeling they're going to be enslaved in some way , if they start getting pushed around there's nothing they can do . I highlight this with a very inefficient opposition to Donald Trump , it's mostly catty bitching and ridicule about him , no strong heroic campaign , no inspiring message as an alternative . That would be the old school way of dealing with it . Young people, it's your future , the older people are warning heavily against being part of the EU , we not doing it because we trying to ruin your life or are closet racist , we see danger , we've seen more of the world . For tens of thousands of years , the village elders or tribal elders were trusted . Don't throw that all away thinking the older people hate young people . Basically the Middle East and Africa is emptying into Europe , and it could just be the start , we might really want and be glad to be on our own . That is just one of many many reasons .

3224,"I think WTO rules means free to make deals without having to go to Brussels to beg.

I think WTO rules means the UK can go to Brazil and tell them that their cheap beef can replace the more expensive Irish beef if they agree to a lower than WTO tariff on UK goods.

The reason trade deals take so long to negotiate is because one party usually wants something. Why did the TPP take ages? Because digital rights protection was tacked onto it. It took ages to negotiate because Wikileaks showed the world what was actually in it with regards to the draconian legislation where companies could SUE countries for lost profits. Companies would be given the right to challenge environmental protections in courts.

You see how cancerous these multinational deals are yet?

Another issue was NAFTA vs TPP. You see NAFTA loves cars. But Japan makes cheaper cars than NAFTA. So if only 30% of the car has to be NAFTA made to avoid the tariffs then NAFTA isn't happy because NAFTA requires 65% of the car to be NAFTA made. So Japan can now compete with NAFTA and so on.

That's the real issue with trade agreements between multiple nations. They are fucking horrendous because each nation wants to protect itself. The Dutch don't want imported Milk because they make all the milk in the EU. The Germans don't want imported grain or cars because they make grain and cars. Czech Republic officials REFUSED to negotiate with the US on ANY limitation of poppy production because they are the major exporters of poppy seeds and the US hates anything even tangentially related to drugs.

You see how hard it becomes to agree to something with 28 nations fighting each other?

Meanwhile Trump has told the UK that they'd be able to get a very good deal. Most likely even a 0 tariff deal. Of course the UK would still be a net importer... but it's already a net EU importer.

3270,"That was a Benjamin Franklin quote, intended to demonstrate why people can't rely on democracy alone to protect them and why a democratic system will eventually result in the annihilation of the minority by the majority (see: Hitler) unless they have other ways to defend themselves (see: second amendment). The wolves get one trivial meal each and the sheep loses its life, leading to an overall loss of happiness. But the wolves are in the majority so it's fine!

What I'm saying is that we should apply democracy consistently and see where it leads us. For instance, the results of the referendum in the UK indicate strong support for Remain in some areas and Leave in others. So logically London and Scotland and whatever else it is should be allowed to secede and remain part of the EU while the rest of the UK leaves.

What do you mean, their democratic vote to Remain doesn't count? Why not? Because the military will make sure they don't get any funny ideas such as independence and London doesn't have the firepower to fight for what it wants (see again: second amendment). But the EU is bad because a distant majority makes decisions that go against your own interests and enforces them under threat of violence. Got it.

3308,"&gt;No, the arguments in favor of leaving were not generally accurate, as that has to include their analysis of the downsides of leaving, which was pure fantasy. And monetary cost was bigger than control over EU reform, and that was total bullshit.

Jesus wept.. People were polled after the referendum on why they had voted the way they did. The three main reasons listed above are what that polling highlighted. All of them are accurate in that they are perfectly valid reasons to suggest leaving the EU. The fact that you disagree with why people might prioritise something doesn't make it inaccurate.

In short, people value things to different degrees, you may see the loss of single market membership as the single most important aspect, or you might come to the conclusion that the loss of the various competencies that the UK has is worth it for some other benefit of EU membership, but that is a purely subjective, personal preference on your part. It doesn't make anyone with a different set of priorities and aspirations wrong.

Let me put it another way, I an quite ideologically wedded to having an NHS that is publicly owned, and free at the point of use, I think that privatising it would be a bad idea. Yet if the UK privatised the NHS, it would see boost in GDP and likely in economic activity in general. It'd have a societal cost and in my view wouldn't be worth it at any price, but you could argue that economically it'd be a benefit.  That doesn't make me wrong about my position on the NHS, it simply means that I think that the health, social and ethical benefits outweigh the economic potential. Surely that's a reasonable position to take?

&gt;The same tools like allies that haven't been pissed off? OH WAIT

I disagree about this statement. I think that the backstop crystallizes the opposition of the Parliament, but solving this issue alone wouldn't suffice to reach a majority, let alone a solid one. The issue goes deeper than the Irish border. The issue is that the UK doesn't agree about what Brexit should be, and as long as they don't, it's useless to negotiate with the EU, because no matter what deal is reached, it would be sunk in the Parliament. The current deal, even without the issue of Northern Ireland, wouldn't get a majority of the votes because this deal gives no advantage whatsoever above a full EU membership. It forsakes voting rights for ideological purposes but ends up remaining in the sphere of influence of EU legislation and having to follow most of it. That's the real issue with this deal. The backstop is only the most unacceptable part of the deal, and it's useful for Brexiteer MPs in order to make them look like they care about Northern Ireland (while none of them spared a thought about that when campaigning for Leave).",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/alfhxp/i_love_this_frontpage/effc4yz/,Pampamiro,1548922805

3676,"Plenty of evidence, feel free to google it. 

The biggest take is that in the UK most homeless people are seen as deserving their plight, and as such not deserving help.

The biggest cause of homelessness is relationship breakdown, at 47%. Physical and mental problems (these include drug and alcohol addictions) are at 23%, 10% of this being drugs/alcohol. So that's 1 in 10. Most people believe the main reason is drugs. People generally see drug and alcohol addiction as a 'choice', and as such people who've made poor choices aren't seen as deserving of help. This feeds into long-standing rightwing rhetoric about the undeserving (shirkers, scroungers...). In our society, if you are poor and struggling, people see it as your fault. That attitude has been deliberately encouraged for political reasons.

If you do want to look into it, you can type 'UK attitudes towards the homeless' into google. It isn't particularly pleasant reading to be honest. It will show my main assertion, which is that most people in the UK believe the homeless deserve it.

Crisis and Salvation Army have a lot of of information if you care to read.
You ever heard the story about the guy that begs and then goes around the corner to his 'insert flash car'. He gets around that guy. Kensington, Oxford, Manchester, Glasgow. That anecdote gets told in every town I've lived in, by most people I've discussed the issue with. It's a complete fabrication.

US/Mexico border = Hard. 

US/Canada border = moderately soft, above WTO but not remotely near US/Mexico level.  

Like I said, you are very ignorant on the matter. 

&gt; So if a country invades another one, annexes half of it and enters peace negotiations, the border that would be implemented would only check trade goods?

No. When Russia annexed Crimea it created a new border and could enforce that border how it deemed fit. It deemed tanks to be fit. The EU can put tanks on the ROI side of the border if they wish, would be smart but it's EU territory. 

&gt; The UK is leaving a Union of states. The default border by definition is a hard one. Only after negotiations you can soften it.

No it's not. A default border is like most borders in the world, WTO border. A FULL free trade agreement can remove WTO borders.

3858,"&gt;If the UK asked Ireland and the EU to agree to the backstop but in reverse.

This is not a reasonable proposition. It doesn't even make logical sense. The EU CU is made by treaty of 27 (formerly 28) states. Why would it by treaty join the UK in a UK CU? What does it gain from such a thing? 

&gt;So the EU becomes a vassal state and Ireland joins a customs union with the UK, until an alternative solution the UK prefers is found. 

Firstly, you should stop using the term 'vassal state'. It's political rhetoric and smacks of somebody's talking point. None of the states in the CU who are not EU member-states are vassals. They chose that arrangement.

Second, the key difference is who is doing the leaving. The UK originated all of this activity--it wants to strike out on its own. But it also wants to have an intimately close relationship to the EU, and it has responsibilities to RoI via NI that persist.

The UK is not owed a deal, it is voluntary on behalf of the EU.  If the UK want access to the SM/CU, it comes at a price. If it wants a negotiated FTA, it comes at a price. 

So this is not at all about who is controlling whom, or who should join whose union. It's about what is being offered at what price, and what one is willing to do to get what one wants. It seems lost on the UK that the EU gains nothing from the UK it didn't already have. All that it can get out of this best case is no damage, making the process really a damage limitation exercise.

It's the UK who stand to gain--notably to continue having unfettered access to the SM while being able to set independent trade policy. And for this, it is willing right now to give nothing at all in return. Certainly it is not willing to pay the price of admission to the SM, or to assuage the concerns of Ireland, who stands to be deeply affected by its withdrawal.

Indeed how did such a man lay plans that would only come to fruition so many years later? That is a good question indeed and one that I would endeavor to answer, were it not for the fact that there is an even more important question that we must deal with.

Why did Charles Haughey implement this plan, if he had only sixteen more years to live, a fact that must have been known to a man of such great foresight. Foresight with he demonstrated to us in hindsight by executing his great Brexit plan. Now I'm not saying that Charles Haughey slept with Nigel Farage's mother, so she could give birth to the great corner stone of British Brexit, but only because his plans did not require such a feat.

Since he planned a plan that could only be completed by the time after his passing, he cannot have acted in the interest of personal acclaim or even fame. As I am sure the honorable member of /r/europe /u/ABoutDeSouffle will readily admit. Knowing a thing or two about the heart's of men, we know that no motivation is so pure and strong that a man can act on it, without expecting some boon, no not even Haughey's patriotism alone could have been enough. There is only one thing that could have made him do so, great vengeance. From this sliver of evidence we can unravel the whole cloth of deception. The Queen of England spurned Charles Haughey in his youth, an act for which he never forgave her. And it was this lust for vengeance, the kind of lust that can only take hold of a young man's heart, that motivated the architect of Brexit to set out on this course.

Winter doesn't tend to just knock on your door during a nice 20C day, and go ""Here's you delivery of -40C. Have a good day!"" It comes gradually which means people who live here permanently ha already acclimatized to almost as cold weather.

Re: GFA knowledge, two points. 1) you accused me of not having read the GFA, without any reason to. It's true that a person from Ireland may not necessarily have read it, but if there's anybody likely to have read and understood it, it's us. And we don't need to be lectured about it. 2) No one attempted to deprive you of a right to comment. Rather stop appealing to your own authority.

By the way, hard to say I haven't read it when I'm quoting it.

Re: 'scaling them back', not in dispute. If you want to see exactly what that means, look at border now. 

Re: customs checks versus border checks--the point isn't what is being checked, it's who is checking it and why. And no it's not talking (just) about military installations. The explicit term used is 'security' installation.

Re: security installations--point (ii) is explicitly clear. No security installations. You want to put them back in, you have to justify 'consistent with the level of threat'. This is not possible because the installations ARE the threat. 

Re:Trimble, firstly don't appeal to authority with me. I don't accept it. 

Secondly, the context of 'status within the UK' actually means 'a  part of the UK' if we're talking strict interpretation. It's about the UK not ceding NI back to RoI. 

Likewise, if we are not arguing strictly, NI's status within the UK has not been changed by the backstop no matter how you want to argue it. On the one hand, NI would still be a full member of the UK. Still be able to participate in all UK governance. And still a part of the UK markets. An additional regime of customs regulations is not a change of status.

On the other hand, the status from which NI would be changing is from the CU, EU. And it's the UK who is changing its status, against NI's explicit wishes in fact. In that context the backstop isn't Ireland changing NI's status. It would be Ireland trying to prevent the UK from changing NI's status.

So if you want to argue that regulatory alignment = status, then not having a backstop is what is illegal. 

Ireland are not attemtpting to force a change on NI. We are  demanding preventing a change as the price of admission to attain a trade deal.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/alcffc/german_foreign_minister_we_will_not_allow_ireland/efdwcvn/,the_straylight_run,1548879118

A Soviet victory in Poland could have spilled into Germany.  And given the prevailing sentiments of the French, Italian, and British publics, I'm not at all certain that there would have been much will to rescue Germany from communism (due a combination of hostility to Germany, exhaustion from war, and a growing feeling of working class discontent after so many young men were butchered in the war).",Canada,/r/europe/comments/akwkd8/what_do_you_know_about_the_polishsoviet_war/efdwtfy/,sluggathugga,1548879413

Why would you want either of these options? They only lead to hatred and conflict between the UK and wider Europe.

As an EU member we were able to take advantage of not only free trade within the EU but also we were able to take advantage of trade agreements made by the EU with other non-EU countries. For example, while Brexit has been going on the EU has signed or negotiated deals with Canada, Japan and Singapore. We're not exactly going to be in a strong negotiating position from outside the EU and the fantasy of a resurgent and prosperous UK outside of the EU are just delusions.   


In terms of migration; 

1. Most of the concerns seem to have been based on xenophobia surrounding Islamic refugees (that's largely governed by the UN and we're remaining a member of the UN even after Brexit) or the suggestion that Turkey will shortly be joining the EU (that's not on the cards). 
2. It's also ridiculous to oppose migration in general because all reputable studies show that migrants in general provide a net economic benefit to the UK.

And I disagree on the idea that international law isn't ""passed"" by citizen, because it technically is.

To ensure that he doesn't go to far, we have a fail-safe : if the president were to act against the mandate he's been given (before 2007 it was ""were to commit high betrayal""), the two chambers of the Parliament (National Assembly and the Senate) could form the High Court, lead by the president of the National Assembly and vote the destitution of the President. This didn't happen.

(in practice the destitution of the President takes longer than the dissolution of the Parliament, as shown by De Gaulle himself in 1969, who was on the verge of being kicked out, dissolved the Parliament, lost the legislative election, organized a referendum to change the Republic, lost it and decided to leave and retire)",Aquitaine (France),/r/europe/comments/al1i6x/a_senior_judge_has_resigned_from_one_of_the_uns/efd8odz/,Thelk641,1548864311

There are plenty of successful independent countries in the world. We don't need to a clone of the USA. Hell, I'd rather join the USA than the EU. At least it works properly, for the most part, and speaks a language that we share.

You take ~£9,000,000,000 every year and send us unlimited numbers of migrants and enjoy unrestricted trade with us in a way that has caused an enormous trade deficit. We contribute massively by being your cash cow and dumping ground for people and a shop for goods.

4328,"&gt;but it is still people’s right to make the decision and they did. 

No it's not. It's their right to elect leaders that can make sensible policies for the better of the nation.

&gt;It is a democracy, each person weather a butcher, shopkeeper, professor, professional or doctor they all have equal vote

Yes, an equal vote in who will lead the nation. Very few countries has direct democracy - and there's a very good reason for that. You mention that everybody from shopkeeper to professor has an equal vote, which is true, but they certainly don't have the same knowledge to create policies from. That is why most countries professional politicians (representatives) who has the time and knowledge to understand what they are dealing with.. well at least they should try to understand it.

&gt;The referendum elected new government, Cameron resigned, mandate of current mays govt is to leave EU

The referendum itself was reckless. You should never give out huge political decisions to the public to vote, because the public usually lack the knowledge to make sensible decisions. Let me give guy an example; I live in Denmark. Denmark consists of a peninsula and a bunch of islands, so we a ""little belt"" bridge and a ""bit belt bridge"" to connect our islands, which makes transportation much easier. Today nobody could imagine not having those two bridges; they make everything so easy. But if they had been up for a popular vote then we wouldn't have gotten them because people was against them and didn't have the insight to see why they would be great for the country. Popular votes are rarely a good thing, and never when it comes to complicated political decisions. 

&gt;Unfortunately, for whatever reason, British people chose past instead of future and gave in to some shortsighted matters I.e fear of immigrants etc 

Because they didn't understand it. There are educations that spends years on teaching students about the EU, and even then it wouldn't be able to cover all aspects of it. The British people are like most other people; they vote based on what they feel or think - not based on facts. People go home from work, picking up kids and have to cook dinner; they don't have the energy, will, time or know-how to take these very complicated and decisive decisions. Leaving the choice for people is irresponsible. 

Imagine if you were a mechanic but you allowed your standard shopkeeper, butcher, professor and whatnot to vote on what to add to the engine next - that's how a direct would work: it wouldn't work.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/al4ny0/the_ema_staff_in_london_has_held_a_final_ceremony/efcwk9k/,Secuter,1548857338

It resulted in death of 100 000 - 200 000 ordinary USSR citizens who were mostly simple people of polish descent who lived within territories of USSR.

Joining the Euro has been terrible for Southern Europe. It’s damaged them severely and then crippled their ability to get out of trouble.

The pound has dropped from £:€ 1.30 to £:€1.15 and £:$1.45 to £:$ 1.31. Hardly a huge amount of value. Especially when you consider exports have actually grown since the brexit vote, as has foreign direct investment. At a glance:

Exports of goods from England increased by 3.1% to £247.6 billion

in Scotland, goods exports increased by 6.2% to £29.6 billion

in Wales, goods exports increased by 3.0% to £16.9 billion

in Northern Ireland, goods exports decreased by 0.2% to £8.6

Parliament has ruled out what they don't want, but there is no majority for an alternative scenario to a no deal. An extension is something the May cabinet is against, and there aren't enough MPs to force her to ask the EU for one. 

And the backstop will only kick in if the MPs vote for May's deal, which was resoundingly rejected by the biggest majority in British history.

So, unless there is a major shift in thinking amongst the MPs and less voting along party lines, a no deal scenario is the default, simply because they can't agree between themselves on the alternative.

&gt;A  final  consideration  is  that  Russia  faces  significant  principal-  
agent challenges. Many of its proxies might have other agendas, alter  
\-  
native interests, and an ability to hide their activities from Russian offi  
\-cials. One telling example is the separatists in Ukraine. Igor Girkin (also   
known as Strelkov), a prominent separatist fighter who claimed to be a   
former Federal Security Service (FSB) agent, was apparently removed   
from  his  position  and  returned  to  Moscow,  where  he  has  become  a    
prominent critic of Russia’s policy in Ukraine.

 Russia cannot always   
control individuals and groups, and even when interests are generally   
aligned, Russia will exert significant pressure.

The Present Perfect especially is used under *wildly* different circumstances than our Voltooid Tegenwoordige Tijd even though they’re constructed the same way (HAVE + past particle). 

Example.

“Ik heb gisteren tennis gespeeld.”

The correct translation would be: “I played tennis yesterday.” And not, “I have played tennis yesterday”, which is ungrammatical.

The second is about which power plant can be taken off the grid and when. ""So that the light does not go out and the electricity continues to come out of the socket and everyone knows: Germany is a country with a very high security of supply"".
&gt; 
&gt; Altmaier defended himself against accusations by environmentalists that the plans left too much time. ""We want security of electricity supply to be guaranteed at all times,"" he said. In view of the nuclear phase-out, the purchase of cheap nuclear power from abroad is also not an alternative. ""So we need flexibility.

- East european states are angry about Germany not having to pay transit fees anymore once the pipeline is done. This kinda makes their outrage look weak, as they are not opposed to Germany getting anything from Russia, they just wanted the fees.

- The USA wanted to sell us their shit instead, and the US diplomat to Germany even threatened sanctions. Which makes me wonder why his ass hasn't been booted out of the country yet. It also makes the USA's ""concerns"" against this pipeline look like a farce.

- The project is based in Switzerland and funded in part by German companies.

- The article is quoting Trittin, who mentions this pipeline will support Europe. Not just Germany. 

- Apparently the CDU plans to invest in Ukraine. Not sure what they are mad about then.

- Project is basically just an extension of an already existing pipeline. Cancellation of that project from Germany's side would result in damages in the billions to be paid to Russia. Not sure anyone would like to have Russia get free money.

In short, it's not as one-sided as many here make it sound. It is however a symbol that Germany and most likely all of Europe failed to manage their energy. It's also a reason why Europe needs the EU: Because our continent does not have enough natural resources and we will always need them from the US, China or Russia.

4826,"because the distance between the two parties is unbridgeable. We have diverged too much to be able to live under the same roof and the British establishment has become a liability to the existence of the EU.

The earlier they are out of the EU institutions, the earlier we can build a cordon sanitaire to fend off their toxic anti EU rhetoric. I've got nothing against the average British person and I accept that they want different things (I, for example, do not share their obsessive opposition to an EU army, but I can understand if they do not want to be in a federal EU), but the British politicians we can definitely do without. 

It was a flawed decision to let the UK in IMHO, as the British establishment only intended to be in the EU for a short ride (i.e. until the road got rocky). It was clear from the beginning, from the treaty of Rome (1957) that the EU was intended to be more than a free trade bloc and would lead to more integration between its members.

The British establishment either saw whatever was most convenient for it to see or was too dumb to understand the treaty. Since I am sure the British politicians are anything but dumb (though the recent shitshow makes me doubt it), they just purposefully intended to partake in the EU to get back on their feet and abandon the ship at the first sign of trouble. 

I do not want such a member. It's reasonable to look after one's interest if they coincide with the group's interests or if they are prepared not to get 100% of what they want, but the British politicians do not know how to compromise.

In a 2 chamber parliament there could be the represents of the people (parliament) and the represents of the members (council). So something may just pass with a qualified majority in both chambers (does not need to be 50 % .... can also be 66 % or something like that in the council).

4961,"Speaking as an Irishman, I’m in favour of tax harmonisation *in principle* but as a practical matter, once everybody has the same corporation tax rates, what stops all multinationals from relocating to France and Germany? Why would a multinational set up in Ireland? Is it because of favorable tax rates? Not anymore! Do we offer a central location with cheap and easy transport of goods and services to the rest of the continent? Definitely not - we’re a half an island, on the periphery of the continent, who soon won’t even be able to freely trade with the other half of our own island! Not to mention that large soon-to-be-former EU member geographically between us and the rest of Europe. Do we have pleasant weather? Not particularly! Is it because we’ll be the only native English speakers in the EU? Evidently not, or the companies leaving the UK in response to Brexit wouldn’t have chosen the Netherlands.

I GET why France and Germany think tax harmonisation is an awesome idea, but I have NO idea what the rest of Europe think they’re going to get from it. Once tax is taken out of the equation, does anyone think Google is going to move to Sweden? Spain? Italy? No - they’re going to either France or Germany. Facebook? France or Germany. Hell, RYANAIR will either go to France or Germany.

“Well, cost of living is quite low here, so they might move here in order to pay their employees less”, Poland or the rest of Eastern Europe might say. WRONG. Salaries for executives are a drop in the bucket compared to taxable revenue. A multinational’s European HQ isn’t just where the lowly “employees” work; it’s where the rich bigwigs work. Which means it’s also where rich bigwigs live. And rich bigwigs like to live in rich neighbourhoods in rich cities with a rich nightlife of expensive establishments where they can hang out with other rich bigwigs and complain to each other about how hard it is being a rich bigwig. And those rich bigwigs get a say in where the HQ sets up - where they want to live. In Ireland, rent and cost of living in Dublin is TWICE what it is anywhere else. Multinationals could save a lot on salaries if they set up their HQs in cities like Limerick, Cork or Galway. But where do they ACTUALLY all set up, to the point that it’s putting pressure on rents? Dublin. Because it’s the bigwiggiest, fanciest, most convenient, price-is-no-obstacle city in Ireland. For the EU, you know where that translates to? France and Germany.

Now, this could all be fine. Maybe, there’s a plan to give small member states some sort of alternative mechanism for competing with the obvious centrality that France and Germany offer. Maybe when corporate tax is harmonised, it’ll all go to EU coffers instead of national coffers, and get distributed amongst all members in some sort of fair manner. Maybe. 

So I’m not going to say Ireland is automatically opposed to tax harmonisation; I’m just gonna say that we’ll be very interested in the exact details of the proposal.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/al4ny0/the_ema_staff_in_london_has_held_a_final_ceremony/efbl6il/,LeoBravo,1548815462

People have been told for years that leaving the EU was inconceivable. The EU brings so much economic prosperity that no one would want to leave. That even if they did want to it just could not be done because the countries are too bound up in EU law, institutions, trade. And finally anyone one attempting to leave would be forced to bow to the will of the EU during exit negotiations. You can see it even now in the way a lot of comments talk in absolutes: that a second referendum is the *only* way to resolve the issue, that the MP *have to* cancel Brexit regardless of the referendum, that the UK *has to* come back once they realize their mistake, that the UK should just give in because EU holds *all* of the cards. 

For years people have been told that the future of the EU was expansion and ever greater integration. But now not only is the #2 economy leaving, but it is track to do so with no deal at all. Something that only a few years ago everyone *knew* was impossible. Brexit changes the game because even if no other country is likely to leave, it's no longer theoretically impossible. It means leaving the EU is no longer a scary jump into the unknown abyss, but something that can be reasoned about with some certainty. And people don't like that. People really really don't like having core beliefs, things they knew to be true, turn out to be false. It undermines their identity and they tend to take it personally.

I am sorry but I think there is no easy way out, because many things contribute to this. Israel need weak and divided West Bank, Israel need Palestinians in West Bank to not be equal to the Israel proper Palestinians, and so on, to secure Israel territorial gains and future for Jewish Statehood. Last thing Israel need in geopolitical terms is Palestinian state, with independent economy, educated people, independent government, military and control over it's borders.

At the same time those things I mentioned - in West Bank especially, but in Israel proper also fuel extremism, as this phenomenon arises everywhere where second class citizens/very unfairly treated minorities/groups are present.

It was a vote about whether the UK should or should not be in the EU. That's a reasonable question and a fairly fundamental one in the context of democracy and self governance. There was also a long period where people could educate themselves, the government contacted every household in the country and made the case for remaining in the EU.

People make decisions that impact others in every election, whether council or parliamentary. Arguably the last few General Elections, by returning parties pushing austerity policies have done far more harm than leaving the EU will do to large swathes of the population. 

If democracy can't be used to make fairly major changes, then whats the point? If any major decision that will have a real impact on people is problematic and it is a *""mistake to let the average joe make such a huge decision that could fuck millions of people over""* then what exactly do you see as the value in democracy..

And it doesn't matter how much proof we show, because deep inside it is in your interest to make Spaniards look the worst of colonisators. You are not defending anything but your own grey morals and past, and to do so you need to perpetrate a false stigma over Spaniards to cover you up.  When I present you the first and single oficial debate about the moral right of colonisators, the only thing you can think of is that only ""1 stubborn priest"" made that, (even when the main Queen at the time specifically stated so in his will), without even realising how exceptional an idea like that was even at that time. Of course Spain wasn't a saint, the colons there did almost what they wanted because they had an extreme adventageous position: far away form the kingdom, but in matters of colonisation what Spain fighted for in those lands was much better than what european want to make them appear. If Spain comited a genocide, can you explain the diference between south american natives, and north american natives numbers? There is a clear evidence that other colons, like the british, had very diferent relations with their colonies, i.e., kill the natives and put some britongs around. It happened in the USA, in Canada, in south africa, in australia, in I don't know how many islands, and the only reasons they didn't killed the indians it's because there were too many. Yet, the Spaniards are the bad ones... As I said, the ""estimated 70-80 millions"" which is **the first time I have ever heard such humoristical numbers** are the biggest falacy of everything related to this theme. **THERE WASN'T EVEN THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING IN THE AMERICAS** how the hell do you expect Spaniards to kill numbers of people who don't exist? Besides, it has been well demostrated that the majority of casualities was provoked by the plox, which was a mystery at the time, and not only that, as I stated before, in the first 100 years of the colonization only 54k people arrived to the americas. **148 people every year**. You are telling me 54k people killed 70 millions of people? lol

Citing David Cook, writing about the Black Legend and the conquest of the Americas wrote, ""There were too few Spaniards to have killed the millions who were reported to have died in the first century after Old and New World contact""  ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_of_indigenous_peoples#Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas+) )

I don't know if you are trolling or if you really think what you're saying is true, but as a european with european education I'm gona ask you to please consider what you are saying, and what you have been told about this part of history, and adopt a critic spirit and question if it's true for the sake of rationality. When you look at the history it's obvious the Spaniards weren't as bad, nor as stupid as people try to make them appear. One of the reaosn is that Spain was the only european colonist after the medieval times that mixed with the natives, and you know what uses the fall of the Spanish empire for ideological reasons? Adolf Hitler. It's written in the mein kampf that Spain fall was due to the mixing. (which is stupid because we started mizing when we started the empire, and the fall is normal for every empire that has been on this earth). You know who keeps treating the Spaniards as inferiors? I will let you answer that alone, looking at how colonial empires have acted, and still act today.",France republic / Spanish republic (in progress),/r/europe/comments/akz6t8/spain_is_the_eu_country_with_the_highest_life/efaimgm/,DamnLace,1548792584

5346,"&gt;Prior to the collapse of the USSR and the archival revelations, some historians estimated that the numbers killed by Stalin's regime were 20 million or higher.[11][12][13]After the Soviet Union dissolved, evidence from the Soviet archives also became available, containing official records of 799,455 executions (1921–1953),[14] around 1.7 million deaths in the Gulag[15][16] some 390,000[17] deaths during kulak forced resettlement and up to 400,000 deaths of persons deported to Forced settlements in the Soviet Union during the 1940’s[18] – with a total of about 3.3 million officially recorded victims in these categories.[19] The deaths of at least 5.5 to 6.5 million[20] persons in the famine of 1932–33 are sometimes, but not always,[2][6] included with the victims of the Stalin era

From the Wikipedia article on ""excess mortality in the Soviet Union.""

&gt;The Holocaust, also referred to as the Shoah,[b] was a genocide during World War IIin which Nazi Germany, aided by its collaborators, systematically murdered some six million European Jews,[c] around two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe,[d]between 1941 and 1945.[7] Jews were targeted for extermination as part of a larger event involving the persecution and murder of other groups, including in particular the Romaand ""incurably sick"",[8] as well as ethnic Polesand other Slavs, Soviet citizens, Soviet prisoners of war, political opponents, gay menand Jehovah's Witnesses, resulting in up to 17 million deaths overall.[e]

From the Wikipedia page on the Holocaust

Also:
&gt;He ruled the Soviet Union from the mid–1920s until his death in 1953. Initially presiding over an oligarchic one-party systemthat governed by plurality, he became the de facto dictator of the Soviet state by the 1930s while holding the posts of General Secretaryof the Communist Party of the Soviet Union(1922–1952) and Premier (1941–1953).

From the wiki page on Stalin. 
Stalin was in power for ~25-30 years (depending when you consider his reign started). If you consider the start of his atrocities the Great Purge, then he was killing people from 1934 - 1953 (his death), so 19 years of killing. As per the wiki article, the Holocaust is considered to have been from 1941-1945. 4 years. 

So, Hitler killed 17 million people in 4 years, while Stalin killed ~9 million people (if you count the famine in his numbers) in 19 years. So yeah, if Hitler won the war, he would have probably exterminated most, if not all, of Eastern Europe.

From the document itself:

&gt; The CPI 2010 is calculated using data from 13 different surveys or assessments produced by the following 10 independent organisations

#

&gt; There are two different types of sources. The first one is business people opinion surveys. The second one is assessments (scores) of a country’s performance as provided by a group of country/risk/expert analysts.

They also list the kind of questions all these different surveys contain, and it's not just ""do you think there is corruption"".

They have also looked into all sorts of effects such as:

&gt;For scores provided by experts, only the most recent iteration of the assessment is
included. The reason is that these scores are generally peer reviewed and therefore
scores do not change abruptly. Unlike opinion surveys, expert opinions are subject to,
and draw heavily on, peer reviewed. Consequently, evidence shows they are less
prone to sudden fluctuations from one year to another than surveys.

Your only rebuttal to all of this is ""I'm sure they asked the wrong people instead of trying to collect objective and comparable data"", and ironically the only reason why you are doing all this is because the result of their study doesn't correspond to your opinion.",,/r/europe/comments/akxdk2/corruption_perceptions_index_2018/ef90kug/,35383773,1548756455

The European Commision uses this ""corruption"" in Bulgaria for excuse to use political leverage when needed. After all Bulgaria should be a dog (more like puppy) on a leash.
