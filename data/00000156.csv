1,"&gt;Think of it like hardline zionists accepting being made part of palestine,

Ok but again, Israel and Palestine LITERALLY kill eachother, have been at war since for ever and Palestine and Israel in terms of economics, politics, and life is MUCH MUCH more different. And what’s more, Israel is effectively a Jewish state and Palestine is a Arab one. 

Neither UK nor Ireland are up into each others throat on this nor are they different religion or anything. My question isn’t “do people actually get mad”

My question is “You have absolutely no idea how deep seated the hatred many unionist northern irish have for any and all things irish.” What is that hate? Like for their religion? Ethnic make up? Government type? WHY do they hate?

38,"&gt; What on Earth does this even mean?

It means that formal political mechanisms  (Constitutions, electoral systems, laws, etc) should consider the informal political culture of the polity (for example, how easy it to establish a durable multi-party parliamentary majority supporting a government post-elections; or how effective can a minority government be)

The classic example normally given on Poli Sci 104 is how in the 18th and 19th century, lots of countries in the Americas rushed the emulate the American Constitution. It didn't work in most of those countries.

IOW, that there isn't a ""one-fits-all"" solution.

Therefore perhaps Mediterranean countries have majority bonus because it's the solution that works for them while other countries don't because it's unnneded.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm talking about when the concept of French secularism/laicite formed compared to our secularism. France might now be 48% catholic, but historically it has been a homogeneous Catholic country until very recently.

&amp;#x200B;

In America, the ""establishment"" during the 1700s was seen as the Church of England, but the majority of the country back then was not from the Church of England. That's why freedom of religion is focused here on freedom to exercise religion. Everyone was scared that their religion would be restricted, so the culture was more focused on ""live and let live"". That said, religion isn't supposed to meddle with politics, it's more the fear of religious restriction which could be used by a dominant religion to restrict other religions. 

&amp;#x200B;

In France, the country was nearly 100% Catholic during the 1700s, the French Revolution viewed the Catholic church as the establishment enemy and turned against religion in its entirety.

&amp;#x200B;

Both of these reactions were against the establishment, but these took very different forms. The establishment in France was the Catholic church (which was all religion in France). The establishment in America was just like any state imposed religion. That might sound like a subtle difference, but it produces very different outcomes. Like Hijab bans don't exist in the US because that would be a ban against a religion.

Contrary to popular belief, Schengen does in fact allow for *temporary* (up to six months) border controls in cases of emergency or national security. For instance, Germany reinstated them during the G20 summit; France did the same in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. 

However, few things are as permanent as a 'temporary' national security measure, and that's exactly the problem here and elsewhere, for instance on the German-Austrian border, where it only took a few migrants crossing the border for the state to go completely haywire and violate its European treaty obligations.

233,"&gt;A single party having more than 50% of the seats is pretty horrible for any parliament, since it means that there are no safeguards against corruption. 

A pretty deranged claim. Any sort of evidence to substantiate it?

A reminder that the most stable liberal democracies in the world, like the US and the UK, that have managed to keep away totalitarian regimes like communists and nazis, have systems that promote the existence of single party majorities.
 
&gt; I'd rate this especially dangerous for a country like Greece, where corruption has a big tradition.

The rationale for bonus systems that assure a parliamentary majority is that it promotes good governance as it prevents the constant instability, horse-trading and potential for corruption of minority governments or alliances.

The counter-example normally presented is Italy.

While plenty of rationalist fanatics disagree, culture matters. Formal political mechanisms, like the electoral system, should be adapted to the local culture of their societies. Perhaps the culture of Mediterranean societies is different? Perhaps electoral systems that are appropriate to some countries aren't for others.

The huge differences in how post electoral alliances are negotiated in countries like Sweden and Austria vis a vis countries like Spain and Italy suggests there's something to this view.",,/r/europe/comments/cab84l/greek_pm_concedes_defeat_in_snap_election/et81lwl/,Jooana,1562543990

&gt;they have done some good stuff, for example the Macedonia name deal

This topic is highly controversial in Greece and may be one reason why Syriza lost many voters


&gt;However, they have some weird people in the party

I am not Pro ND or actually any other party, but you should know that Syriza had many important MPs from former PASOK among their ranks in positions of power.
I really dislike using this source but it was the best english one I could find after a quick search:
https://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/10/12/is-syriza-the-new-pasok/

&gt;Varoufakis [...] Technically a correct statement, but he did exactly the same thing in 2015. 

I do not agree with this statement.. There were different plans, which were created and approved by most finance ministers of the EU and also the IMF. But in the end they couldn't agree in some major topics e.g. the amount of budget surplus required etc. As you can see, the measures, which were implemented, did not actually save the greek economy, which is still crippled by all means. The measures primarily helped the creditors of Greece. 
I noticed how you wrote the name of every Party except for MeRA25/DiEM25, where you used the name of its secretary. Now this may be your only criticism or even your only point about this party, but I would recommend that you look into their manifesto.
As to Varoufakis as a politician, I believe that he is very smart and the proposed policies of MeRA25/DiEM25 sound valid. On the other hand, I have my doubts about him, because of how poorly he has handled multiple stories about him and hoe it always seems as if the fault lies mostly with everybody else when he explains how things turned bad in 2015.

Most of the other heads of government don't look beyond the EU as a cash cow. The one mistake the ruling powers made was to create the illusion of democracy with the EP.

&gt; There's no good reason why such minor cosmetic issues should exclude produce from sale.

I agree. Yet consumers don't.

I used to volunteer in a charity leftover produce redistribution, and consumers are very, very picky.

Your criticisms are correct but you seem to overexaggerate the damage SYRIZA did while downplaying ND's role in the creation of this mess (it's not just ""people were dumb and egotistical""). 
At the same time you ignore the nepotism, populism and messianism evident in ND not only in the past but also in its electoral campaign. Those aren't isolated cases you can just handwave away.

In Spain 68% Homicides are from men to men, 28% from men to women, 7% women to men and 3% women to women, Now there is an added tragedy to the murder from men to women, and it's that is usually in a close enviroment, between partners or ex-partners.

&amp;#x200B;

So in conclusion there is clearly a problem with men driven violence.

Europeans take the welfare state to the next level where it becomes harmful to society and economic growth, well beyond just healthcare and education. We have had public schools in America since the 1600s, but nobody would say we were a welfare state back then.

Background for those not in the know: In the summer of 1990 the process of dissolution was ongoing, with the Croatian government implementing policies that were seen as openly nationalistic and anti-Serbian in nature, such as the removal of the Cyrillic script from correspondence in public offices (the Serbian register of Serbo-Croatian is usually written in an adapted Cyrillic script while the Croatian and Bosnian registers use the Latin alphabet). Meanwhile, texts on Yugoslav history were withdrawn from school programs, as well as works of Yugoslav writers and poets, with new emphasis being placed on the history of Croatia in particular and literature by specifically Croatian writers.


As tensions rose and war was becoming more imminent, Serbs in public institutions were forced to sign ""loyalty sheets"" to the new Croatian government, with refusal to do so resulting in immediate dismissal. The policy was especially noticeable in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, as some of the Serbs serving there were arrested.

The industry actually wants these standards because they ease trade and reduce costs.

The grade A from Germany, or the 1b from Spain?  
And the importers, they have to handle, and pack, different grades for all the different countries.  
You seem to have this idea cemented in your head that regulation=bad, and no regulation =good. That’s a too simplistic view. Often, as in this case, the regulation actually help in removing trade barriers.  
You find unacceptable that a large economy concerns itself with quality grades. Okay.

The main strength of Prague and the sole biggest reason people visit it is that it‘s a cradle of well preserved European architecture from early Medieval to Enlightenment, not some unbounded worldly diversity. Modernist stuff is but a bonus. That doesn‘t mean it is bad or inferior or deserves no admiration, but it‘s just not the main strength of the city, not in itself and not as part of „diversity“.

845,"&gt; All design is artificial. 

This is true, however certain styles evoke greater perceptions of naturalness than others, for a variety of reasons. There has actually been a ton of research done in this area — especially regarding the extent to which art and architecture (which is almost all artificial in some sense or another) can mimic naturalness and (by extension) grant the psychological benefits of nature/naturalness (that nature is good for our psyche and reduces stress is basically a accepted fact at this point). 

This [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494418305280) deals particularly with the potential implications of this in architecture, and posits that the reason people like pre-modern styles so much might be more complex than ‘tastes change’.

[Germany integrating migrants quickly, according to business chief](https://www.thelocal.de/20181214/germany-integrating-migrants-quickly-business-chief)

&gt;Many among the more than one million people who arrived in Germany as migrants or refugees since 2015 are integrating speedily through work, the head of a key business group said Friday.

&gt;""Today more than 400,000 are in employment or training... even I am surprised at how quickly it's progressing,"" Ingo Kramer, head of the Confederation of German Employers' Associations (BDA), told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper.

&gt;""The vast majority are in jobs subject to social security contributions, and that integrates them into society,"" he added. ""Business leaders are getting it done.""",European Union,/r/europe/comments/ca4ccg/german_rescue_ship_heads_to_malta_after_italy/et5vb6n/,Canal_Volphied,1562491894

But Kosovo is a perfect example to demonstrate that the ultimate power no longer lies in the nation state. In the 19th century, Serbia would have been allowed to retake Kosovo by force and it would have been seen as part of the natural order of things.

If you accept illegal (war and violence) reasons for reductions in sovereignty, then the 19th century states didn't have full sovereignty either because it was full of warring states attacking each other.

Fact is that communities smaller than states if they're sovereign derive their power from states which devolve their authority. And supranational institutions derive their power from states as well. 

The only institution with original power that is not devolved from another institution is and remains the state. You know why? Because that's literally part of the definition of ""state"".

And unlike Ancinet Greece, the average citizen has a less let power over the decisions of his country.

1062,"No, for numerous reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Some did convert to Judaism, but it was only the aristocracy that did so. In order to maintain independence between Christendom and the Muslim empires. The commoners were still most shamanistic, but also had some Buddhists, Muslims, Jews, and Christians thrown in for good measure. Even if some Khazars did mix into Ashkenazim, it wouldn't have been enough to significantly alter the gene pool.
2. There is very little Turkic admixture in Ashkenazi Jews. Genetic studies show that the majority of Ashkenazi Jewish DNA stems from a combination of Levantine and Southern European. Broadly, Jews are more genetically related to each other than they are to their gentile neighbors.
3. There are little to no Turkic loanwords in the Yiddish language. Yiddish is classified as a West Germanic language. It's primarily German, with Hebrew, Aramaic, and to a lesser extent Slavic and Latin vocabulary thrown into the mix. 

&amp;#x200B;

If the Khazars were the ancestors of anyone, it would be the Jewish groups that existed in the area they controlled. Notably these would be the Krymchaks and Crimean Karaites (or Karaims). The claim that Khazars are the ancestors of Ashkenazim was made up by the antisemitic left in order to discredit the historic connection that Ashkenazi Jews have to Israel/Palestine. There's a lot of historical revisionism that goes on in Zionism, but that isn't part of it. Even if it turned out that a significant Jewish population did not have the DNA of the ancient Judeans, they would still be connected. That isn't how Jewish society works. It's neither purely religious nor ethnic, it's tribal.",,/r/europe/comments/c9sht3/religion_in_europe_from_1ad_to_2019ad/et5keaw/,absolutelynot1234,1562477103

1175,"it depends where you go in the US.

While it has problems it is no worse than europe is. The UK, Czech Republic, Germany, Sweden, Luxenbourg, France, Ireland and a few others all have higher homeless ratios than the US. Drugs, particuarly opiod abuse is a bit more prevelent in the US than europe but we have our fair share. Europe has its fair share of violence, some eastern european and baltic countries have higher homicide rates than the US do by a notable margin.

One thing you have to take into account is that culturally the US, UK and a few others like France openly criticise themselves on both the domestic and international stage and the public/press ability to do so is a deeply held belief, this can give the impression that countries like the US are wild or messed up however in reality all countries have problems, a lot considerably worse than the US, they just are not as open about those problems. Theres also the fact that the US is the leader of the free world so naturally it gets a lot of air time when it has domestic issues.

I've lived in the US before for work and it was great, actualy prefered it in many ways to the UK. ""where is better to live"" is always going to be a difficult question as different people want different things but the US is absolutely one of the best countries in the world to live in. 

In 2017 there were 2,920,000 western-european born migrants living in the US compared to 690,000 US born migrants living in western europe.

On the road to Rethymno visit Balos. 
At rethymnon nothing special just, make a stop visit old Town and leave. It's a beautiful city but it has the worst beaches.
At Chania there are few nice beaches close to the airport but the most beautiful is elafonisos which is south of Chania, 1hour driving. Also Chania is the most beautiful city of Crete,Which it will be packed for the next 2 months. 

In general the best beaches are at the south part of Crete.
Also, don't leave out the east part of Crete. Go to Agios Nikolaos and Voulisma Beach.

In Ierapetra city you can visit by boat the Chrisi Island, with the most crystal clear blue waters otherwise  Long Beach(3km) or  kakkos Beach.
Sitia is more rocky but had some very nice places to go such as, Vai and xirokampos Beach.

Lastly, if you like small old traditional villages, oropedio lasithiou is a good choice. However, there are hundreds of theme everywhere in Crete at the top of the mountains.

&gt; 

Jesus Christ, have you ever seen the number of granted asylums in Italy or are you willfully this dense?

&gt;Which you can be denied which many refugees experience despite having valid asylum claims.

&gt;""Tunisia is a safe place to claim asylum. Sure you can't legally work but why does that matter""

Again, you completely fail to understand what asylum system in Geneva convention was made for - provide shelter until conditions in home country improve, and then move them back.

Just because as far as you are concerned its permanent citizenship, that is not how vast majority of the world sees it.

&gt;When did I say that?

Christ, did you even give two thoughts about what you are saying here?

If you shift goalpoasts to such ridicolious degree, where only place where one should be able to claim legitimatelly asylum is Global north, Global north will eventually take a wrecking ball into that whole system like Australia did. That is natural consequence of proposing system under which at least 5 percent of entire world population are eligible to claim asylum in Europe because everything else is ""unsafe"". Because guess what, amount of African countries where asylum system is set up within ECHR line stands at literally one - Morocco and only because we forced them to.

So, since you probably didnt keep up with the news, this is what happens? We have a fuckton of Eritreans arriving who jump the ship in Libya and right off the coast goodie ship is waiting to ferry them to Lampedusa? The endresult is EU financially bankrolling ex-Janjaweed militias who currently compose Rapid Support Forces whose job is now to patrol Sudanese-Eritrean border and catch all Eritreans who try to make it accross and return them under guns back. Algerian military shipping them through desert back to Niger. Libyans doing Libyan ship that more than enough has been written about. Moroccans shipping migrants to desert of Western Sahara. All under auspice of new policy of external border. This is, of course, not even half of what has been done.

You know why? Because EU states are too chickenshit to change the internal asylum / migration policies and are facing the consequences of mass movement of people to Europe as we seen in 2015 and later because it is allowed. And because people like you scream murder when Bundestag even tries to declare Tunisia a safe country, they wont do that until Salvinis accross the continent actually take the power and will massacre the legislative system as was literally done in Italy already.

Can't do it in Italy. It was made illegal after it was proved to be wildly successful.

[Salvini removes migrants from a model village for integration](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/salvini-fait-evacuer-les-migrants-dun-village-modele-dintegration/)

&gt;Lucano’s integration strategy helped to reignite the economy in an impoverished region long neglected by the government: Riace’s one bar reopened, as did a handful of shops, while the system helped generate jobs for locals – as teachers, translators or cultural mediators.

&gt;“It brought me prospects,” says Angela Cristodolu, who teaches migrants needlework. “There was nothing before.”

&gt;Houses in the town’s “Global Village” were turned into artisanal shops, with migrants working alongside locals to make and sell products including ceramics, hats and chocolate.

&gt;Lucano’s arrest came a week after Salvini unveiled a series of anti-immigration measures that included slashing funds for migrant reception and integration, leading many to suspect a political motive. The arrest also followed the suspension by the public broadcaster, Rai, of a TV show about Riace’s exemplary integration model.

&gt;Salvini welcomed news of Lucano’s arrest, writing on Twitter, “who knows what all the other do-gooders who want to fill Italy with immigrants will say now”.

&gt;As humanitarian deeds jar with the minister, there are now fears that the government will clamp down on dozens of other towns that have adopted similar initiatives. Nearby Camini faced a similar fate to Riace before it started to integrate migrants – a plan that boosted its current population to around 800, including 150 foreigners, enabled derelict homes to be restored and for the school and post office to reopen. As in Riace, friendships have been forged between locals and foreigners.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/c9vwd0/italy_migrants_new_charity_ship_docks_despite_ban/et4dsbp/,Canal_Volphied,1562448406

copypast from the first found requirements in german university in english.
[quote]© Prof. Dr. Wengler 4 April 2013 (3)Stylistic requirements of a master thesis involve a sophisticated linguistic style, as well as a proper and logical written composition of the relevant arguments. 1.3Academic Misconduct A  master  thesis  needs  to  fulfill  high  academic  standards  in  many  respects.  Since  the  failure to comply with these requirements may result in a lower grade or even failing the thesis, it is important to be wary of potential forms of academic misconduct. As  part  of  a  student’s  “intellectual  integrity”  plagiarism  is  to  be  avoided  by  all  means.  This  term  refers  to  the  utilization  of  words  and  ideas  of  others  without  indicating  their  proper  source,  i.e.  claiming  them  as  one’s  own.  In  academic  work,  plagiarism  is  considered  a  severe  violation  of  private  property  and  is  strictly  forbidden.  Hence,  all  submitted master theses are electronically screened for unquoted source material. If the computer  program  detects  plagiarism,  this  invariably  leads  to  the  student  failing  the  master thesis. [/quote]

1661,"A building should ideally represent the local vernacular, and I don’t know why that’s such a big ask when we build. Think about it, do you want everywhere to look the same? If not, then why not build to resemble the history of the local area? This would make cities look diverse, unique and respectable to the local history, even if the neighbouring city had a similar style, as it is genuine to both the founding of the city, and the present, with all styles and monuments in harmony with one another. By contrast, the idea of building everything in one style, wastes the human’s power to create beautiful and unique spaces to live in. 

In addition, in the past, when we did have commercial and big businesses working, they didn’t need a big glass tower to work in, So why do you need that now? It develops a boring, unsocial and generic environment that could be improved so much more.

Of the question of beauty, it’s a fact that the majority find traditional buildings to be beautiful, and modern building either completely lack that feature, or they fail to impress us as much. Does this building look powerful, strong, independent? Well of course, but we have a troubling habit of building the same everywhere, which just sounds dystopian and soulless to me, I mean, does our history and culture mean nothing to us anymore?

You’re right to say that medieval centres could represent similar styles, but even then, that only represents specific regions in the world: Bavaria has a distinct predominant style, Schleswig-Holstein another, Provence region, France, another. So when you say they work or look virtually the same as this does to London, I disagree completely. You can go to shanghai, Tokyo, Birmingham and again, Frankfurt, and see the same-styled buildings pictured above. Is that right? Pardon my language, but fuck no!

Furthermore, I didn’t mean to sound all anti-finance, sorry, I simply said I didn’t like the styles of the buildings and that a different style should be used that is smaller and less arrogant. Modern economies are of course different to ones in the 1800’s, but I’m sure with our ingenuity and resources we can work to make something more human representative of local areas than this.",,/r/europe/comments/c9jl3w/frankfurt_am_main/et3k5uy/,HateModernArchitectu,1562434743

If a people has no way to avoid extermination but enclose an area so as to keep away the exterminator, and to rule one's own self, the question of whether what they have enclosed (as land) and whether that enclosure can be considered a country is not only absurd but also inhumane. If for some reason the Swiss Germans began to slaughter the Swiss French (with the stealth backing of Germany) all the while the central Swiss authority not only willingly ignores but also plays an active part in the extermination of the French populace, and if France intervenes and pushes the Swiss Germans back, I am not gonna sit here and talk about whether the France should have intervened or how far inland they should have gone, because those issues are all trivia when compared with the human tragedy that took place. And I do not need to open up and skim through tomes of international law to come to the common sense conclusion that those people can now form a state that should be recognized by all the countries that claim to have the slightest of respect for human rights.

1686,"&gt;IDK what you mean with bogus sources? Like make a web page for a fake university and post there that you have a PH D?

No, those would easily be picked out. What I mean with bogus sources are propaganda and fake news created by a state or an organization in order to influence people. A prime example would be an interview Swedish television channel TV4 had with a russian security expert in which the russian expert claimed the Swedish island of Gotland were demilitiarized during the 1920's and that the island should be demilitarized again to reduce tensions in the baltic sea area. This statement is incorrect and its purpose was to influence people in Sweden to push for a demilitarization. The interview could however be used as a source (albeit a bogus one) in a wikipedia article about the military presence on Gotland. Only someone with detailed insight into the military presence on Gotland throughout history can debunk this.

Some sources:

I understand they bring up a lot of criticism towards Muslim migrants, but a lot of their criticisms are quite correct and right to bring up. I remember not hearing about the cologne incident, in which tens or hundreds of German women were being sexually assaulted by a majority group of migrants from Syria and Iraq. The AFD, I think, brought light to this, and told people what happened, rather, the town tried to silence and downplay the whole incident. Tell me who’s crazier now!

I value the idea of a secular society, by the way, I don’t care what religion you have, but, I do care about the cultural norms you bring, and it’s a fact that groups from the Middle East are incredibly traditional and conservative.

1925,"I'll deal with the general points rather than address each one individually (though I would point out I am not talking about interviewing say Polish Catholics for the results, these are general polls of all the population).

The trend certainly hasn't peaked in 2006. The last NI assembly elections, in 2017, support for explicitly unionist parties fell below 50% for the first time and the first time since the partition in 1921 when unionists didn't win a majority of seats and the first where unionist and nationalist parties had equal share of seats (39 between Sinn Fein and SDLP and 39 between DUP, UUP and TUV). The 2017 UK general election saw a support for Sinn Fein up, gaining 3 seats more than 2015

2017 NI results: first preference votes: DUP 28.1%, UUP, 12.9%, TUV 2.6% and PUP 0.7%) while pro unification parties were up overall (Sinn Fein 27.9%, SDLP, 11.9%). DUP lost 10 seats, UUP lost 6 while between them, Sinn Fein and SDLP lost just 1 seat. Sinn Fein were just 1168 votes from being equal with DUP - they were 35782 behind in 2016 and 20212 behind in 2011 and that is massive, SF could potentially be the biggest party in NI at the next election.

Brexit is a massive factor, polling in Oct-Nov 2018 of 1334 Northern Irish residents showed that based on the withdrawal agreement 39% said they'd support staying in the UK, 48% including the probably figures (with 30% in favour of UI, 48% with the probables included. Based on UK staying in EU 47% said they'd 100% vote to stay as part of the UK (60% with probables) with 21%/29% in favour of UI. However, based on a no deal, that changes to only 38% in favour of remaining in the UK (42% with probables) and 48% in favour of reunification (55% with probables).

What you need to remember is the changing demographics as older hard-line types like Arlene Foster are replaced by moderates and younger people who don't hold the more extreme religious views like the DUP and SF have. Protestants are outnumbered in the under 35s. A [Lucid Talk poll in 2018](https://lucidtalk.co.uk/images/News/LTOct17TrackerPoll-GeneralReport.pdf) showed 56% of 18-44s support reunification vs 34% supported staying in the UK. Come 2022 (assuming nothing before that) and the next scheduled NI assembly, SF will almost certainly be the largest party and nationalists will have the most votes thus triggering the requirement for a unification vote. If Corbyn is in power by then, that vote will happen and Ireland will be unified by the late 2020s.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/c9ill5/northern_ireland_has_reached_the_900th_day_of/et281w0/,Tuarangi,1562412534

* 28 violent antisemitic motivated attacks
* 98 violent attacks against specifically left-wing politically opponents
* 24 violent attacks against other political opponents
* 774 violent xenophobic motivated attacks 

**Even if** we assume that for some crazy reason the German stats were so ""falsified"" that every single anti-semitic attack came from a different group...

Then there would be **more than 20 times the amount of violent attacks against other groups**. Unless, obviously you're now going to argue next that xenophobic violence from the far-right is also committed by other groups.

Violent antisemitic attacks are a massive, massive minority in the overall scheme when it comes to violent hatecrime in Germany. Yes, they're bad, yes we have indicators that their ""traditional"" attackers aren't the sole or even primary attackers anymore but in context trying to abuse their numbers to play down right-wing violence should not be a thing.

2116,"Germany also accounts for a very small number of incidents. 1800 most of which are hate speech, graffiti and displaying the swastika, so while troubling because it's on the rise, in absolute numbers it's not a big part of the wider issue.

The question is about direct harrasment, both in terms of verbal and physical attacks and here we get a discrepancy. Felix Klein the German commissioner on anti Semitism (who brilliantly suggested that Jews should not dress in a way that displays their religion) will gladly point out that the majority of the 1800 incidents were attributed to the far right, he will not break down the 67 physical attacks per group.

Since he has no issue pointing out the far right as the purports elsewhere, I have to conclude that the 90/10 split does not hold true there.

Furthermore, we have an issue of massaging stats since it's hard to believe that in the whole of Germany during an entire year, the sum total of times someone harrased a person verbally on the street came down to less than 1800 times (since hate speech is only one of three big categories specifically mentioned) 

It's far more likely that the cases of verbal harrasment never get reported as there's very little point unless the harraser left a name and address. It's also more than a little condescending to say that the people being harrased don't know what they're talking about, our stats clearly show Muslims aren't an issue so the Jews saying that's primarily where the issue is coming from are obviously wrong.

In the NYT article on the rise of anti Semitism in Germany you had Mr. Klein admit that there was in fact an issue with refugees from places where Israel and Jews were vilified bringing that stance to Germany, quite literally as they would continue to follow the same news outlets, but then goes back to the 90% number for the right wing, but gives no stats for incidents regarding Muslims. 

It is relevant to point out that yes, the rise of the far right as a legitimate political force is by far the bigger picture issue and has the potential to be far worse long term. However, when talking about why Jewish people don't feel as safe as they did in the past, when talking about where they're seeing their lives get worse day to day, it's not the primarily or even secondarily the right wing.

In northern Germany there is a community of speaking people. They get special support for teaching dansk in schools. Or their political parties are exempt from the 5% barrier for votes to the parliament .... there are only 50000 to 100000 of them, without the exemption there wouldn't be any political representation for them.

Keep in mind that this was a matual Agreement with Denmark, the German speaking minority there seem to have also language support by the schooling system.

And then there is also a dying-out minority of Sorbs in eastern Germany. I'm not exactly sure about the status, but I know that some village and street names are bilingual where they settle.

There is a concept of an official language in Germany, ""Amtssprache"". For the whole country, we have just German. But for smaller parts (country, county, town, village) there are more. In the list are Dänisch (dansk), Niederdeutsch (lower german), Friesisch (frisian), Sorbisch (sorbic), Englisch (english), Französisch (french).

2145,"In a nutshell: the British Government has the role of neutral-ish mediator between Unionists and Republicans in Northern Ireland, according to the Good Friday Agreement. After the 2017 elections, the Tories entered a confidence and supply agreement with a Northern Irish unionist party (the DUP) to survive parliamentary votes. All the while, Northern Ireland hasn't had a government for almost three years now because of issues between these two communities' most representative parties, and the DUP is therefore in no rush to restore the NI government, where they'd have to get into talks with Sinn Féin (republicans). And from a purely political perspective, why should they, given how they're holding the *entire UK* government by the balls?

2146,"Gdańsk was literally founded by Polish duke in late 10th century. There were short periods when eastern Pomorze was independent for short time, the longest one was after death of Leszek Biały (1227), but in 1294 was once again part of Polish kingdom. 

In 1308 Gdańsk and Pomorze was conquered by Teutonic order, but Polish king never renounced his claims (dominus et heres). Gdańsk rebelled several times (1361, 1378, 1410, 1411 and 1416) against Teutonic order. In 1410 it recognised Władysław Jagiełło as a king. In 1440 Gdańsk became part of Prussian Confederation that in 1454 recognised once again Polish king as a rightfull ruler of Prussia and started another uprising.

Gdańsk did not have some special autonomy as part of PLC, they just had wide privileges, that were almost on a par with nobles (so wide that in 1661 Kongisberg townsmen appelaled to Polish king to acept them once again as his subjects). 

&gt; And during a lot of that time, the majority of the city were people who would be seen as german peoples.

They identyified themselves as Prussians (do not confuse with Prussians of kingdom of Prussia). 

&gt; Though the spoken language was often a German dialect during a lot of that time.

Before that they didn't bother with politics, so the scene was occupied by more moderate parties who saw it as the only legitimate way to effect change.

So a site can have multiple IPs, an IP can have multiple sites, and the situation can change at any moment. Blocking DNS usually causes less issues and site owner can't do anything other than changing the domain to mitigate this, so while it's pretty easy to bypass, it's often preferred method.

Now the trust massively expanded paramedic training numbers and have great rates for staffing and unit provision. They also run many good schemes to supplement their service.

I'm a bit fuzzy here, but if you mean ""Johnson hasn't given Northern Ireland the right to abortion"":

* AFAIK, Johnson isn't personally responsible one way or the other for abortion law.

* The decision on whether to permit or deny abortions is not made by Johnson even if he becomes PM.  Parliament *could* make a law, but Parliament has chosen to devolve that power to Northern Ireland.  It's Northern Ireland who made the call not to do abortions.

You can agree or disagree with that call, but I have a hard time seeing how Johnson is the responsible party here -- the people you're complaining about are the residents of Northern Ireland.

Personally, I don't really see it as a particularly large issue even if one is adamantly in favor of abortion availability.  If you live in Northern Ireland, you have the right to go to either anywhere else in the rest of the UK *or* to the Republic of Ireland (which just started allowing abortions) and get an abortion.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/c9eqyl/what_unites_johnson_and_hunt_in_northern_ireland/et0xepo/,vokegaf,1562388548

It's a giant clusterfuck. We have Brexit coming up and we share the only land boarder with the EU and nobody knows what were going to do. The DUP (unionists) back up the conservative government in parliament, which gives them extra power over the nationalists which allows them to hold of on ratifying past agreements. The nationalists use the current clusterfuck to try to pass more aggressive language acts that really could wait until the more important things are solved, but giving in would be another opportunity for DUP to stick their ugly foot in the door even more and push on with a no deal Brexit. 

And the DUP are laughable. They want to be more British than tea and scones but don't want any progressive laws the mainland has, hence why we don't have access to abortion (in any circumstances) or gay marriage. And the one green energy project they overseen was used and abused by the DUP and their friends as a get rich quick scheme.

Nope, nothing to do with speed. They are used when you suddenly brake, as regenerative braking doesn't work fast enough.

What? If the battery is 100% full indeed they don't work, but you should never charge to 100% anyway. And the problem is when the battery is too cold, not hot.

That would double the amount of local governments and the expenses of having local governments.

2615,"&gt;I have no idea how people keep coming up with this shit.

By knowing how economy works. 


In case of an economic downturn a country's currency gets devalued and it's citizens get temporarily poorer. But, now those country's exports and products are much more competitive on the global market and the country becomes a more attractive tourist destination

This is how Iceland quickly recovered from it's horrible crisis, while Italy, Spain and Greece haven't. 
It's also why the UK was doing much better than the Eurozone. And it's also why Sweden recovered much better than Finland (they were on the same level before) 


Every economist on the planet will agree that the Eurozone is not an optimal currency area, interest rates that are good for Germany are not good for Portugal, and without a fiscal union one country is bound to get screwed. 

Italy for example used to be on par with Germany per capita before the euro, since the introduction of the euro it's been constantly stagnating

2722,"The first 3 are entirely dependent on german economic stability which means that they're not allowed to have expansionary local policies. In turn because the ECB uses a 0% interest rate it is starting to alienate german citizens because you literally have a negative rate on a deposit which doesn't let them save money which they desperately need saved since they have one of the lowest home ownership rates in europe and one of the highest household debts. 

The 4th one is a double edged sword, there's a very good reason why the US, Canada and Mexico don't all use the same currency even though more than 90% of their trade is done with each other. That economic integration means industries are going to move to the most favorable place in the Union, which is not necessarily a bad thing if the other regions would be payed for it but that doesn't happen in the EU unlike in the US. 

The euro zone made it such agriculture is moving towards France and the Netherlands, Auto towards Germany and Tech towards Poland, Czechia or Romania. This looks all fine and dandy and diverse but Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are all more or less very close to bankruptcy and we know that they're not going to be bailed out (it is impossible to bail Spain and Italy) which means that they need to cut their expansionary programs and implement austerity. And there you have the problem, while they bring out austerity the rest of the union is being expansionary with thick social programs and spending. This alienates the population and can only lead to bad things, and it can also happen to Germany as well considering the fact that the entirety of the union rests on the fact that Germany can export as much as it does.

The fifth point is really a dream if anything, the EU doesn't and will probably never have a coherent foreign policy. The East is firmly pro American because they're the only ones who guarantee their sovereignty without taking away from it as well while the West is firmly anti American (especially Germany) because they want to be great powers again. You won't make Romania, the Baltic states or Poland tolerate Russia in 50 years maybe not in a 100 even and that alone makes it that the EU can't have a stronger presence. Even if the East is in the EU, they won't back down their pro American stance for nothing and if that happens by force there will be revolutions worse than those in Ukraine.

2746,"Oh, good.  An opportunity to link to my [favorite Slate Star Codex article](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/):

&gt;In Chesterton’s *The Secret of Father Brown*, a beloved nobleman who murdered his good-for-nothing brother in a duel thirty years ago returns to his hometown wracked by guilt. All the townspeople want to forgive him immediately, and they mock the titular priest for only being willing to give a measured forgiveness conditional on penance and self-reflection. They lecture the priest on the virtues of charity and compassion.
&gt;
&gt;Later, it comes out that the beloved nobleman did not in fact kill his good-for-nothing brother. The good-for-nothing brother killed the beloved nobleman (and stole his identity). Now the townspeople want to see him lynched or burned alive, and it is only the priest who – consistently – offers a measured forgiveness conditional on penance and self-reflection.
&gt;
&gt;The priest tells them:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;It seems to me that you only pardon the sins that you don’t really think sinful. You only forgive criminals when they commit what you don’t regard as crimes, but rather as conventions. You forgive a conventional duel just as you forgive a conventional divorce. You forgive because there isn’t anything to be forgiven.
&gt;
&gt;He further notes that this is why the townspeople can self-righteously consider themselves more compassionate and forgiving than he is. Actual forgiveness, the kind the priest needs to cultivate to forgive evildoers, is really really hard. The fake forgiveness the townspeople use to forgive the people they like is really easy, so they get to boast not only of their forgiving nature, but of how much nicer they are than those mean old priests who find forgiveness difficult and want penance along with it.
&gt;
&gt;After some thought I agree with Chesterton’s point. There are a lot of people who say “I forgive you” when they mean “No harm done”, and a lot of people who say “That was unforgiveable” when they mean “That was genuinely really bad”. Whether or not forgiveness is right is a complicated topic I do not want to get in here. But since forgiveness is generally considered a virtue, and one that many want credit for having, I think it’s fair to say you only earn the right to call yourself ‘forgiving’ if you forgive things that genuinely hurt you.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/c9d7a2/german_priest_causes_church_walkout_as_preaches/esz53li/,vokegaf,1562355334

US, Canada and Georgia basically ran the first stage of reforming our law enforcement. And the units that they helped with are really changed for the better. The ones that our government did on its own afterwards - not do much.

I don't blame the Brits for bowing down to wave after wave of foreign invader, going with the flow and letting them completely overwrite the prevalent culture time and time again. Sometimes, it's easier to just tow the line. Be subservient. Bend to the stronger will. Adaptability is important. In the end, it worked out really well for you. The Norman, French and later German royals who took over the country eventually conquered half the planet and brought all of the British and Anglo-Saxon peasants along with them for the ride. Talk about the meek inheriting the Earth. Your stubborn, strong-headed neighbours to the North and West could have learned a lot from you. Pointlessly fighting against the sustained influence of the new European overlords in a bid to retain the outdated Celtic culture of the British Isles. Silly.

We were talking about radical policies. I'm not concerned about greens in particular, especially when Germany simply not allow radicalism due to having a very healthy political system.

&gt; Believing the Feudal class in French would had just let their power down

In 1789 feudal class haven't had much power. Classic Feudalism with fiefs and servage ended long before 1789, yet the agricultural society ended long after (hence Le Goff's notion that medieval ended in the end of 19th century). 

The gradual shift towards the power of the cities and free inhabitants started in 13th century. In the end of the 18th centuries the merchant class was defacto a ruling class, a french aristocracy was a joke, French was long enough a monarchy.

The French revolution, as other European revolutions, happened not because the exploited class raised and overthrew the exploiters. It happened because the de facto ruling class claimed their power and stated their position de jure.

European revolution happened because the kings, who actually overthrew feudals with the power of the cities, started to withdraw the privileges they granted to the bourgeoisie.

The best book on topic is the ""King's two bodies"", which tells about the state of the kings' power at the time: it was based solely on the agreements with the progressive city inhabitants and the granted privileges to merchants and free people. The revolutions were caused by the kings breaking their words, hence loosing the legitimacy in the eyes of people.

There is no list of ""Poor safety precautions in every plant on the entire planet"". There's no link to provide for you. But they are there and denying it is laughable. That's the brainwashing part.

3127,"A big problem is how car ownership has come to be regarded as a status symbol, and advertised as such to perpetuate the impression. They are to create the illusion of ""freedom"", the ability to go anywhere any time you want, regardless of whether you actually have to, or indeed have the *time* to do so even if you wanted. And, of course, too many cars are designed on a ""bigger = better"" philosophy, as a vehicle - pardon the pun - for flaunting the owner's wealth.

In a way, it reminds me of the tiny ""kei""-cars in Japan, and why they aren't popular in the west. Imagine how much smaller traffic problems would be, and how much less of a problem parking would be, if we could just disassociate ourselves from this need for oversized vehicles and drive something only half as big? Unfortunately, attempts at introducing something similar in the west has so far only generated a niche. Ostentation trumps efficiency. I was guilty of this myself when I bought my first car many years ago, making big eyes at how ""regal"" it looked.

In an ideal world, we'd probably have car-free cities where the only traffic is emergency vehicles and deliveries/commuters from outside (all electric, of course), plus a massive public transport grid that is both cheap and easy/reliable to use.

3174,"[How is this not considered a scam? Politically speaking.](https://www.expatica.com/nl/finance/taxes/the-dutch-30-ruling-explained-101641/)

&gt;How does the 30% ruling work?  
Having read the above conditions, you may see that you are eligible for the 30% ruling, but what does it actually mean?  
The salary you agreed on will be reduced by a maximum of 30%. In return you will receive this percentage as a reimbursement for expenses. This is the most common way as it does not influence the salary burden for the employer. However, the employer is not obliged to pass on the advantage of the 30% rule to the employee. **In practice it is possible for the employer to partially or fully take the benefit.**  
In any case, you must still meet the condition that your salary is at least €37,000. This means that, even if the 30% ruling is applicable, reducing your salary cannot result in a salary lower than €37,000. To clarify this rule, see the Netherlands’ 30% ruling examples below.Example 1: 30% ruling calculations
Your salary is €40,000. Therefore, you qualify for the 30% ruling. However, if your salary is reduced by 30%, this would mean a new salary of €28,000 and a reimbursement of €12,000 – but then your salary would no longer qualify for the 30% ruling. In this case, the maximum advantage you could claim under the 30% ruling would be a new salary of €37,000 and a reimbursement of €3,000. You still receive an advantage of the 30% ruling but not the full advantage.  
Example 2: 30% ruling calculations
Your salary is €53,000. Therefore, you qualify for the 30% ruling. As a result, your salary could be split between a base salary of €37,100 and €15,900 as a reimbursement. Since the new salary is more than the minimum requirement, you can fully benefit from the 30% ruling.",Azores (Portugal),/r/europe/comments/c9d6op/poland_moves_to_exempt_young_workers_from_income/esx73q4/,dydas,1562326353

3273,"&gt; The person who refused to officiate over gay marriages felt that being made to officate over gay marriages went against his or her right to freedom of religious belief and expresion, as enshrined in the UDHR.

Your beliefs do not give you authority to deny the rights of other people. You are free to exercise your beliefs as long as, by doing so, you do not violate the rights of other people.

&gt; I don't agree with the guy's views, but I do think that he has a right to feely express his religious beleifs per the UDHR

as long as, by doing so, he does not violate the rights of other people. Praising discrimination is not ""merely expressing a religious view"", it's incitement to discrimination.

&gt; Now, one could and will argue that forcing the person that refused to officate over gay marriages to do so, punishing them if they refused, is a breach of their rights and sends the message that it's OK to discriminate against someone for their religious beleifs to comply with the rights of someone from another protected class, an incitement to discriminate if you will.

As a government official, you don't have to refuse others their rights if you think they contradict with your beliefs. You can have some other official do it instead of denying someone their rights. This option either did not occur to that person or she intentionally disconsidered it. Either way, it's discrimination and a violation of your duty as a government official.

&gt; The crux of the matter is, this guy holds certain religious beleifs but that doesn't mean that, as assumed by some, he will not render the public service that he may be later employed to render, to gay people.

That's not the point. The point is he praised an act of discrimination. That's not ok because it incites to discrimination.

Furthermore, they have much more power than the EP. Under the most common special legislative procedure (mainly applied to agriculture, competition policy and the CFSP), the EP doesn't get a deciding vote and the council of ministers decides by unanimity. 

Basically, the more sensitive a topic is for countries, the less power supergovernmental bodies have. The special legislative procedure used for the topic in question can consist of a variety of measures. So the EP might not be allowed to propose amendments, only be allowed to give their opinion, or is passed by completely and the commission might have to share the power to make proposals on the topic with the countries. Meanwhile, the power of intergovernmental bodies can be increased.

3468,"To people who don´t know what that means:

To gouvern properly those parties need a majority (51+% preferrably) or form a coalition. CDU/CSU and SPD used to be the big guys, usually have 30 - 40%. But they fell from grace. They reigned for years and there was the perception that there is a standstill in politics, same old same old, see Trump election because the establishment is out of touch bla bla bla. So more fringe parties gained support, mainly the green party because they were rarely in a leading position and people hope they will mix stuff up. AfD is pretty much Anti-EU and a Nazi party. Not as openly as the NPD but its pretty much the new nazi party. They claim to be ""concerned citizens"" that want to change Germany beause Migrants and the EU is strangling us with regulations yadda yadda ... you get the general drift.

So what is likely is that CDU/CSU and Green + maybe the left or FDP (FDP rather unlikely) will create a coalition to reign. 

The main takeaway is that the former big polular parties lost significant power, the greens gained major voters and the right is rising up. AfD and SPD having same numbers is absolutely disastrous.

3793,"&gt; This is the latest confrontation in a longer battle launched by the Italian government against non-governmental organisations who rescue people in distress in the central Mediterranean.

I think she means latest action against organizations that are helping smugglers and are putting more people in danger by having them risk their lives first and then pretend to care and maybe pick them up.

&gt;at risk of up to €50,000 in fines for bringing people rescued at sea to Italian ports

A whole 50,000 euros? Damn. That must be tough with the million euros in donations they just got.

&gt;On June 26th, the European Court of Human Rights refused a request from Sea-Watch 3 to disembark migrants in Italy. 

So... follow the courts? Or are we against the literal court that handles human rights now and should break their rulings? I'll need to remember that for next time when a ruling doesn't go the way I like it. Just ignore!

&gt;With 40 traumatised people as well as the crew remaining on board since a rescue at sea on June 12th,

Could have went to another port. Maybe the closed in Tunisia. Also, maybe don't force them through a traumatizing journey and then pretend to care, but help them at the source?

&gt;Rakete decided that enough was enough and it was time to take matters into her own hands

Also known as being a criminal.

&gt;She entered the port of Lampedusa on June 29th without permission, trapping a patrol boat in the process, which she later said she’d apologised for

Apologizing doesn't magically take away your crimes.

&gt;Rakete was subsequently arrested.

And then released again.

&gt;A recent study highlighted various ways in which solidarity groups are policed in order to prevent their support for those migrating.

**Illegally** migrating. You can help someone just fine if they have the papers.

&gt;While the European Commission took legal action to challenge Hungary’s policy, Italy’s actions have remained largely unchallenged by EU authorities so far.

That's because they follow the law.

&gt;The EU’s inaction in the face of Italy’s increasingly hostile agenda ultimately amounts to complicity with the arrest of search and rescue activists such as Rakete. 

Yes, again, because that follows the law.

&gt;The EU priority is to advance a policy agenda that prevents people on the move from arriving in the EU—regardless of where they end up.

You can't just randomly go on the move and expect any country you pick to take you in. That's not how this works.

&gt;Yet as Giorgia Linardi, a legal expert working with Sea-Watch, argues, ‘Libya is not a safe country.

Tunisia is closer then Italy.

&gt;The EU must not continue supporting a situation in which people are at risk of imprisonment for operating vessels under the belief that they have a rightful duty to help any person in danger at sea.

NGOs must not continue supporting a situation in which people are put at risk of abuse, rape and dying.

3794,"Besides the fact that all the borders are very impractical (all the states are unnecessary long and thus difficult to administrate), I would be content no matter how arbitrary my state. Like, bro, it's just a state. It doesn't define every aspect of my being. It just needs to be democratic.

Think of the social wars, where Italians rose up and fought against Rome because they wanted to be Roman citizens. I'm that guy, I just want my representation.

There's of course another impractical aspect which is language. I would not make multilingual states, as it means you need a lot of people capable of speaking multiple state languages and you'll need have translators and multiple official languages, etc. It's a mess. Much easier to have each state have one language, and then have another Union language. That way everyone can speak their mother tongue and learn one foreign language and that's literally all you need. It's efficient.

Now technically you could just set one official language for a multiethnic state and basically force people to learn it. I'd suck it up and learn another language, given a grace period.

3822,"“It's clear that this seizure was to enforce EU sanctions against Syria, not US sanctions against Iran.
But it looks as if both the US and the UK had been tracking the movements of Grace 1 throughout its curious voyage from the Gulf to the Mediterranean.
Curious because such a valuable cargo of oil would normally be taken via the Suez Canal, even if that means using more than one vessel and transhipping the oil because not all super-tankers can squeeze through. It's a massive shortcut.
Instead, in this instance the master took his vessel and controversial cargo the very long route around the southern tip of Africa - the Cape. Was that a smokescreen to conceal its apparent destination - the Mediterranean coast of Syria?
The Americans were acutely interested because they are determined to prevent Iran profiting from oil sales which breach US sanctions.
Britain, by contrast, would not have acted to enforce US measures.
But when the super-tanker, all 330 metres of it, entered EU waters, specifically Gibraltar waters, the British authorities judged they had no choice but to enforce EU sanctions against Syria which the UK pushed for and strongly supports.
Brussels was not involved in the seizure decision. It is not a matter for EU institutions to enforce customs law. That is a responsibility of member states.
However, the Iranian charge that Britain was doing the Americans bidding may be hard to shake off.
That matters because it fuels an Iranian conviction that Europe only pays lip service to its continuing commitment to the hard-won nuclear deal - the deal which Donald Trump repudiated and does not want to survive.”

Iran need to complain to the EU, this clearly wasn’t unilateral by the U.K. or even bilateral between the U.K. and US. The ship was suspected of breaching E.U. sanctions, entered E.U. waters and was seized by an EU nation. There’s very little to be confused about here. If Iran wish to sanction the U.K. they are free to do so. That isn’t to say there wouldn’t be further sanctions placed on them for doing so though.",,/r/europe/comments/c96tnv/iran_summons_uk_ambassador_in_tanker_row/estzzkx/,RainItIn,1562275849

Off course, everything that don't glorify communism or communist regimes it's always western propaganda...

&gt;  After the revolution the death rate in the camps plummeted, actually to the point where western prisons were more dangerous to the inmates. 


True the only difference is that communism gulags had 1000x more prisoners, that's what you people always forget to tell. 

&gt; Russia went through amazing changes under Lenin and Stalin, going from one of the most backwards states in the world to one of its most advanced, the lives of the people became incomparably more safe and comfortable.

Many other countries did the same without millions of corpses.

&gt; Many of them were brave communists

Stalinist gulags had much more communist jailed and forced to work and died in misery because thy had the ""wrong communism"" than czarist camps. The worst enemy of communism was soviet union.

My point was evil shit was substituted by evil shit. Just because one claims to be good doesn't stop it from being evil shit.

Iran, as a regional power exerts it’s influence as superpower like the US does. You see them aiding terrorists around the Middle East and supporting discourse against Israel.

They should have proposed only Timmermans instead of a package. 

&gt;Secondly, having a large consensus is always preferred in the EU for very important decisions such as the appointment of the Commission president. No country voted against VL, in the end her appointment is much less divisive and this cannot be understated. Timmermans on the other hand would have struggled to have enough votes in the Council and in the EP (since the EPP would have opposed him).

Their faction has remained seated or even left the room in several parliaments during minutes of silence in memoriam of Lübcke. 

They are continuously trying to refocus the debate on “left wing violence” in order to distract from the very real problems with neo nazis and their very real ties to neonazis. 

They are also the very big hypocrites: They denounce other parties for verbally attacking them, saying that that incites violence against the AfD. But now, they are facing having to eat those words, because they have been specifically provoking racial hate. A member of their party reposted the comments from Lübcke about the refugees from 2015 earlier this year in a Facebook post in r/the_donald style.   

Now that people are saying that the AfD is partially responsible for Lübcke’s murder, they are of course trying to play the victim.

They're instead now officially rolling with this:

&gt;""Sollten sich unsere grundlegenden Reformansätze im bestehenden System der EU nicht in angemessener Zeit verwirklichen lassen, halten wir einen Austritt Deutschlands oder eine geordnete Auflösung der Europäischen Union und die Gründung einer neuen europäischen Wirtschafts- und Interessengemeinschaft für notwendig.""

In English:
&gt;If our fundamental reform approaches in the existing EU system cannot be implemented within a reasonable period of time, we consider it necessary for Germany to withdraw or for the European Union to be dissolved in an orderly manner and for a new European economic and interest community to be founded.

According to [their own website](https://www.afd.de/europa-eu/) they define their ""reform approaches"" as being against the [Schengen Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement), against the [Maastricht Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty) and against the [Treaty of Lisbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon).

They further want to get rid of the European Parliament and they want to reduce European courts to *exclusively* handle matters *between* states.

And if they somehow can't get all of the above, they want Germany to leave the European Union.

4331,"&gt;You are definitely in the wrong place, down there in Munich. I can name various non-white doctors just within my native city. My son's highly esteemed physiotherapist is Pakistani, for instance, my wife's neurologist is Iranian. And they all speak perfect German (well, the therapist with a slight bit of accent).

I'm not in Munich. I haven't lived there for a long time. Most of my time in Germany has been spent in its most multicultural cities, and I'm saying what I'm saying despite this. 

&gt;Your position is then that Muslims should be allowed to degrade women, LBTQs, Jews at will to help them integrate? 

I'm saying that you should promote a view of Islam that rejects those notions, instead of inherently entwining them with the notion of Islam in your people. Support progressive Islam, denounce archaic Islam. 

&gt;Good grief, I cannot count how often I have passed such discussions as a foreigner in the US. - ""Ah, West Germany! That's communistic, isn't it?"" - You learn to live with it.

Yes, but the Americans do not purport some sense of superior morality on the basis of greater cultural enlightenment and international solidarity. The Americans, much like the British working classes, strike me as proudly ignorant. Meanwhile much of the German public strikes me as hypocritically ignorant in that they derive some sense of superiority from the mistaken belief that they are not ignorant. In some respects, the latter is more dangerous.

&gt;My wife often finds herself addressed in Russian, a language she knows nothing about, especially by real Russians mistaking her for a countrywoman because she very much looks like one. So what? To be classified by your appearance is clearly not a privilege of non-whites! You learn to live with it, too.

My point is that this doesn't happen the world over. My point was that in the UK we train people not to make assumptions about someone's nationality / ethnicity. That's not to say it doesn't happen, but we make such behaviour culturally taboo, to the point that people we circumlocute to the point of absurdity to avoid making an assumption about someone's nation of origin. German society doesn't seem remotely as sensitive to this.  

&gt;Strangely, German leftists and rightists agree that the sight of London, Birmingham, or Manchester (or the banlieues of Paris) is a shameful, though deserved, retaliation for your colonialist past

And by what right does Germany judge anybody frankly? Your imperial ambitions were the most contemptible of them all. If France and Britain deserve ghetto slums, Germany deserves a wasteland. The strange belief of some Germans that they can derive moral superiority over colonial nations for their horrific failed colonial attempts boggles the mind. Furthermore, how superficial to judge these places on sight alone. You'll actually find commendable, thriving communities behind these places if you care to look beyond the surface lack of ""Ordnung"". 

&gt;And immigration of non-Whites to Britain is generally equated with the Jungle of Calais.

Well exactly, completely obvious of the millions of black and south Asian people, who I grew up with, who enrich our society and partake of British society. 

&gt;This strikes me like, ""Never look at Worf's forehead."" If he says he was from Moscow, Earth, everyone should simply accept it at face value and not ask any further questions? Even the Federation is not conceived of as that Utopian! It has nothing at all to do with ethnicity: my wife is as white as you may hope for, yet she is always recognised as one not from here before she even opens her mouth, as mentioned above. In Portugal I have attracted the attention of many a woman with my Nordic pale face colour. Nothing about colour-blindness here, and I acknowledge that I would have a hard time trying to pass for a native there (even if I spoke their language at any reasonable level). Nor would it come into my mind to strive for it - this writing from a place where I am surrounded by people trying out at me whatever tidbits of school German they may recall.

Except you harm people through it. It does not create a welcoming multicultural utopia. Which would be fine, if so many Germans weren't so convinced of their monopoly on enlightened values. 

&gt;They just don't dare to - well, not yet.

I really don't know what that is meant to suggest, but I sense resentment: as I do so often in much of Germany. 

Honestly, I fear for the future of Germany. I really do. There is something lurking beneath the surface here that I find unbecoming, regardless of professed political alignment. This new generation seems not to have taken the history of Germany not as a lesson, but as a strength. Germany the redeemed, with the whole of Europe beholden to its supply chains, setting the political agenda with its might moral judgement. And the Anglo nations? Apparently we didn't learn from our histories at all and are anathema to the new way of things. The only problem is that it's a lie.

Easily proven that that did exterminate all Jews they could on Eastern Front, even karaims in Crimea, which had their version of Judaism and were not considering themselves as Jews. There were few exceptions, like Bulgaria, where Germans just did not want to mess with locals and have tensions, so they left ""final solution"" aside, until the end of the war. 95% of Polish Jewry was exterminated, same in Baltics, Belarus and Ukraine.

&gt;b) simply reading few sentences from the link I provided will prove your last paragraph wrong.

&gt;The only energy source we can scale fast enough are renewables.

This is wrong, just wrong. 
Wind is incredibly unreliable, erratic and barely produces its theoric amount.
Solar functions only during daytime and we are reaching temperatures above their tolerances for them to work properly AND have a very high initial pollution impact.
Hydroelectricity works and is great, the problem is that it is expensive, difficult to build/maintain and you need even more specific conditions on the location for it to work properly, it's a good complement but cannot stand alone for a country like germany.

What's left ? The safest and most powerful and most of all LEAST IMPACTFUL way to produce the ever increasing energy needs : Nuclear.

Besides that, one could easily draw this map in opposing colors and make both the V4 and the Hanseatic League winners. And Italy as well, since Salvini heavily opposed Timmermans. Or redraw the map completely and make different groups.

Though, I do believe Germany would end up being a winner in all of those maps. They already were the main player in the EU and now they have an EC chief as well.

I hope that groups like the V4 and the Hanseatic League will be able to fight that dominance. We can't let the EU be a solely German project. But that's what seems to be happening.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/c8t8xa/the_winners_and_losers_in_the_battle_for_the_eu/esr9mce/,Leocto,1562219815

""Restaurants and hotels"" and ""recreation and culture"" followed with shares of around 9 % each.

The remaining groups of products and services had shares of around 4 % to 6 %: ""furnishings and household equipment"", ""clothing and footwear"", ""alcoholic beverages and tobacco"" and ""health""; while ""communications"" and ""education"" had smaller shares of 3 % and 1 % respectively.

Household expenditure was mostly devoted to ""housing"" in all Member States except Estonia, Lithuania and Romania, where ""food"" was most important, and Cyprus and Malta where it was ""restaurants and hotels"".

4732,"&gt; This is not a firm base. 

It has a basis within the spirit of the treaty and it certainly is not contrary to the treaties. It's a process that embellishes and captures the spirit of the circumstances in which the treaty arrived, following a Constitutional Convention and the later repackaging into the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. The defining change between Art 17(TFEU) and the same Article (214 (28)) as defined in the previous Nice Treaty was going from the phrase  ""shall approve"" to ""shall elect"" when discussing the role of the European Parliament. This single word followed long discussions that the European Parliament should have an *active* role rather than a *passive* role in the formation of the Commission President. Indeed a part from that word, the treaty language within the TFEU for the selection of the Commission President has remained exactly the same. The spitzenkandidaten process was developed in tandem with the treaty change of language from the passive ""accepts"" to active ""elects"", which indeed prompted the change in the first place. Does the process you described of the European Parliament just voting ""yes"" or ""no"" on whoever the Council nominates sound like an active role? What you've described is exactly the same process as occurred before the Lisbon treaty and prior to the change of language, after all.

&gt; They only kinda forgot about the actual voting populations.

No they didn't, as described in my first reply, no real proponent of the system believed it would be a runaway success straightaway. They all believed it would take several runs to establish itself and gain traction.

The politics mess it up (here is a recent journal article discussing this https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438781831099X ) 

There can be no good economic prosperity if the politics are corrupt, and you can have no good politics if the economy is not prosperous/it is corrupt. That is the issue.

4996,"&gt; Hungarian government still has overwhelming democratic mandate

The thing is it's no longer fully democratic, due to takeover of mechanisms that limit their power. It's one thing to win and another to win when the entire state machine is backing you. 

&gt; Fortifying borders and not allowing mass immigration to pour unchecked into Europe is to be expected even if they are demonized by media for this.

And you're still stuck on migration, despite the fact the issue has faded away for most Europeans and there are other states that oppose illegal immigration and don't face consequences Hungary has faced. This angle is simply no longer tenable. 

&gt; I’m not saying Hungary has no political problems but we must understand why this is happening and work to convince them not to alienate further. We like it or not but raise of Orban, Salivini etc has its valid reasons.

I also support open discussion (sun is the best disinfectant, after all), but the thing with Orban is that he doesn't allow open discussion. The matter with him is that the discussion is no longer about valid reasons or whatever, but being able to articulate an opposite view to him in a way that can reach the public. With the media owned by the state now and courts stacked, that is no longer possible.

&gt; There's way too much modern ""let people dress how they like lmao"" 

The thing is that his group in the parliament doesn't enforce a dress code, and that is their choice. Other places of work or groups might enforce a dress code, but his party does not. I may not agree with this, but he broke no rules. We may disagree with him, but he is technically in the right.

&gt; seriously man have a bit of dignity and respect for the people you serve and the institution you represent.

I agree with this, he seems to be saying ""I won't change me for this place/job"" which is fine, but he isn't representing himself he is representing the people who voted for him. If they don't like how he is dressing they should write to him and say. Otherwise its not my business.

Nah, it's the contrary. Socialism is a a nebulous thing, it's an extremely vague term for left wing policies, always was.

That doesn't change just because Marx went ""all those other kinds of socialism are wrong"". You'll see that the countries that go ""socialism=(bridge to) communism"" are those that either succumbed to the red scare, like the US, or the countries dominated by soviet propaganda, like slovenia.

5121,"&gt; Russia is a threat to Europe, not America.     

What the fuck am  I reading. Were you born last week? Russia may not be a threat to you (and  that's debatable, they can certainly cause a lot of damage through subversive tactics even if they can't win  a war), but they're the nation that's most aggressive to the US. They literally tried to kill your people in Syria. Not accidentally, just saw them and tried to murder them. They've messed with your elections and public opinion with every tool available, not even sticking to support one side but occasionally supporting Democrats too to foster more social divide and violence. Everything the US tries to do around the world Russia tries to foil. Whether its military interventions, peaceful relations or beneficial trade Russia attempts to cut it. They have a media empire that correctly and incorrectly blames the US for everything under the sun. And I don't mean just in their own country, no they use their influence to spread that propaganda everywhere.  And your asking me where is America's problem with Russia?      

The reason I involved them is because regardless of what relations the US wants to have with Russia and Europe, to simultaneously want to be friends with Russia but enemies with Europe is just  plain  stupid and completely illogical.      



&gt;So when Trump is talking a stance against Iran, and Europe says “we will help Iran avoid sanctions” how does that work for the average America?    

Tell me how are sanctions against Iran going to help America? Iran wasn't making nukes   and even if the US thought it did (against all evidence) sanctioning them is only going to be an excuse for Iran to pursue nukes even harder.

Europe's  approach leaves America safer than what Trump is doing. It's not like we neglect your safety by supporting the Iran agreement, quite the opposite.   

&gt;But when you say “Americans should also hate Trump because he is bad for his allies” that’s not a winning point for many American minds.   

I didn't say that, you assumed it. Trump is bad cause of who he is, he's attitude towards allies is just the icing on the cake.   

&gt;It’s hard to be friendly to allies when the other group doesn’t see you as an ally. Saying “we’re allies” is a moot point when half the nation doesn’t feel like that.   

Yeah and that's the fault of those groups. The EU and the US have similar ideological  values, have militarily supported each other and died for each other, have no territorial quarrels, are the biggest investors in each other and the biggest importers of each other's goods, have very favourable trading conditions to each other, have greatly relied on each other to achieve their foreign policy goals. It's the best alliance in history between superpowers and the best alliance the US has after Canada. But apparently we're going to throw all that away because the US president said so even if it doesn't make a lick of sense.  It's an utter shame but Europe can't do anything about it.

[False](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/27/science/chernobyl-capping-a-catastrophe.html):

&gt;he has cataracts and other problems related to his heavy radiation exposure during his first three years

Even if he had remained healthy, exposure to radiation is still a game of chance. There can be random reasons why radiation is stronger and weaker in certain angles around the source and there are random ways people's health gets affected.

The supervisor of Chernobyl's block 4 sustained a dose of radiation which kills 50% within the following 30 days, but he survived to die of heart failure in 1995. Wanna use him as a proof how harmless radiation is as well? Because there are lots of people who weren't that insanely lucky. Some died within the next few hours and days, including a couple of his direct subordinates.

The conclusion is questionable because there definitely
are ways to have LE of a different country take down content.
Besides, where did the proposal limit “blocking” to non-German hosts?

The list was to be distributed to providers only so they could
feed it into the proposed blocking infrastructure without
disclosing the contents to the public. AFAIK none of the
countries that implement this kind of censorship disclose
the contents of block lists.

Controling the information given in the card is far from enough, since there might be differences between the commonplace means of contact in different countries. Imagine there is a country where no email address is used and people mainly contact each other by means of telepathy. It is a quite civilized culture and you could expect no one is keen on self-interests. What results would you expect to get from sending them a card with your email address to let them contact you? 

Peculiar but pretty much the truth judged by my own experience, prevalence of email is poor in my country. Seldom do the Chinese people use email except when it comes to business. Even within universities where, you might say, the most educated people gather, it is rare to use emails for communication, let alone the common people. It is very likely that this will add up the difficulty. I know this sounds like seeing China as an exception. But the truth is we are. I can't think of any other countries on this graph having its people walled from the outside of the country. So, there is one thing you would agree: China is not as connected to the world as other countries on the list. 

And you have to admit that there is a possibility that something you have taken for granted is not taking place in the rest of the world. The situation here is bad but not that bad. The cultural revolution did some harm to my culture, but long before that happened the western people have depicted Chinese in Qing dynasty as wicked and selfish figures.

I'm afraid that's not true. José María Ruiz-Mateos was in the exact same position as the one Puigdemont is now. 

Ruiz-Mateos had an arrest warrant in Spain when he run for the European elections. He couldn't enter Spain or he would have been arrested. But after being elected MEP, Spanish authorities had to let him become MEP and allow him to enter Spain without being arrested

Did I say otherwise ?

Of course Germany produces hydro-electricity, and has been doing so since early last century, to the point where all suitable sites are already equiped since the 1970s, with very little room for expansion, except maybe some pumped storage here and there.

And yes, hydro is the best electricity there is : the lowest carbon dioxyde emission per kWh, high output per plant, and the only electricity generation mode that is both *renewable* and *pilotable*. The only downside, but a major one, is that it produces only 6% of what Germany demands.

&gt;Other countries like to cushion their ""green"" numbers by including nuclear.

I'll agree with you in putting *green* between quotation marks, at least until a universal consensus forms on what color is energy and how it changes color during its transformations from one form to another.


Now, on which category to classify nuclear in, it depends, of course, on what you're counting.

Is nuclear electricity low-carbon ? Assuredly. Is nuclear fossile ? No. Is it renewable ? Of course not. Is is the least deadly mode of electricity generation ? Surprisingly, it is. Does it offer private investors a quick return on investment ? No it does not. Is uranium in short supply ? Not for any foreseable future.

All in all, the point is not to cushion numbers, but to be explicit regarding what you are counting and what your agenda is.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/c8lktz/for_the_first_time_in_history_germany_produced/eso5lbo/,Neker,1562160268

5503,"&gt;&gt; if we all made the greenest choices we could, as consumers, we could not even make a dent in the pollution rates.
&gt;
&gt;Nonsense. Going vegan alone would cut 10% of emissions right there. Then there's another 5% in transport and another 10% in heating. The rest is industrial processes that are harder to get a grip on, but you can still choose to buy from an electricity provider that only has renewables: another 10%. Then you need to do research to compare products, but with low-effort things like using consumer labels and simply consuming less stuff in general you can certainly cut another 5%. 
&gt;

we, belgium, have 1 actual producer of power, and they are replacing nuclear with gas.

sure we have many billing agency's who promise they sell green power, but in practice it all comes from the same net, we sell more green power then we produce, so it would appear that buying green power does not actually means buying green power.

&gt;So, all in all, 40% is under your direct control. What's more, even if eventually a carbon tax or similar was imposed, then you would be *forced* to do the same things anyway. So avoid the rush, change your life now.

and your numbers are off, can you source those? and do you realise going vegan does not actually reduce 10%, that meat has to be replaced, you replace pasture lands with industrial crop, wich also causes pollution and reduces carbon reduction, a pasture is better then a field of corn sprayed with chemicals.

5527,"&gt;Heating is an easy one, use electricity. It's not something new and a lot of options are already there.

Using electricity to heat air is very inefficient. First and foremost we should deal with our temperature needs by passive temperature management solutions like insulation, window shutters, efficient house design, and then for the last bit heat pumps which need far less electricity for the same effect.

As an intermediate solution power to gas would even be more attractive, in particular in countries that already have gas-based infrastructure for heating.

&gt;Transport can do the same thing for a lot of options, though things like ships and aircraft obviously need something better

&gt;Industrial processes can also use electricity for a couple of things and use more efficient systems that retain waste heat, capture emissions and other options.

5690,"I understand the context of the concept and never for a moment thought it applied to European immigrants, I'm just saying that strikes me as ridiculously naive and patronising, especially because it presume that Germany has the ability to actively imbue people with those values, or is somehow a guardian of ""good values"" already. 

Either your values will rub off on your immigrant populations, on the basis of their merit alone, or they will not. The notion that you can hold their hands and teach them to embody European values is only going to be met with contempt by most foreigners arriving in Germany. 

Even the very concept of European values I have to question, as if Europe somehow had demonstrably better values or that Europe, given it's history, were some paragon of virtue for other continents to look up to. 

&gt;The more so since Brexit, often interpreted in Germany as a triumph of Nazism and racism; especially by the Right. 

Yet it feels so rich when you actually live in Germany and see what Germany is like. Why do so many Germans believe that Germany is not racist, or less racist? This country is full of racism. Easily as much as the UK, and possibly more. It's the image of Germany as a paragon of virtue that drives me up the wall. Just because there are strong laws protecting immigrants from abuse and it's not publicly acceptable to voice racist views doesn't mean this country is not racist. 

Germany fares adequately in this regard at best. Frankly, this whole country strikes me at really only being at the beginning of the process of becoming a multicultural nation. Proto-multiculturalism I would it. The belief in your own virtue is product of little more than inexperience and unwillingness of many to question whether the social structures and institutions around them are prejudice. 

&gt;particularly the too-well-known English attitude towards Polish immigrants

Yes, the UK has problems with flare ups of racial hatred in the past few years. A problem caused by people who've been radicalised to reject the values of multicultural social liberalism. However, across society, the UK is vastly less racist than Germany because its population has grown up alongside a much greater presence of non-white people as part of their culture. Where are the 4th / 5th generation immigrants in Germany? Nowhere to be found. Many Germans still look at the non-European foreigners as bizarre curiosities and have in no way adapted their own conception of society to include them.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/c822qx/of_people_aged_15_30_who_say_they_can_read_write/esnmax5/,kingofeggsandwiches,1562138523

&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s private sector has had its worst three  months in nearly seven years as the Brexit impasse and poor weather hit  economic growth, the Confederation of British Industry said on Sunday.   
&gt;  
&gt;After  a surge earlier this year, caused by companies stockpiling ahead of the  original March 29 Brexit deadline, private sector activity in the three  months to June contracted at the quickest pace since September 2012.   
&gt;  
&gt;The balance of firms reporting growth sank to -13%, according to the CBI’s monthly Growth Indicator.   
&gt;  
&gt;Rain  Newton-Smith, the CBI’s chief economist, blamed the weakness on the  after-effects of the stockpiling rush, Brexit-related shutdowns in  Britain’s car industry and bad weather.   
&gt;  
&gt;“But underlying activity  and confidence is clearly subdued,” she said. “The UK economy is being  stifled by uncertainty about the UK’s relationship with the EU. The need  for the new prime minister to secure a deal with the EU is urgent.”

The main reason why there's discussion over a border in NI is because Ireland and the UK will soon be in different custom areas. Therefore, a border is needed in order to manage what goods go through and at what tariff. It's really more about trade and economy, at least on the EU's side of the debate. This concern about customs and trade would be exactly identical with an independent Scotland within the EU. Identical. Whether you like it or not.
