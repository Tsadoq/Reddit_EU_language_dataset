You're right about FCAS (and even then the US could not play ball with allowing B-61 integration). The other option of F-18E/F is also an issue as B-61 isn't cleared on that platform....

The best option is of course the US integrating B-61/12 on F-35 as that also will resolve the issue for Italy, Netherlands and Belgium as well. But Germany twisting the US' arm by selecting a new production of Typhoon would be best for Europe. Italy would be sorted by that, and the US will have to integrate B-61 to F-35A at some point so Netherlands and Belgium will get it by default. The bonus of keeping Typhoon production open is too much to lose, plus Germany buying any F-35 could call into question the eventual viability of FCAS.

Not only is Germany keeping them going far longer than other operators and they also need more upgrades to stay relevant.

Maybe the question was carelessly translated to ""očkování"". Maybe people just primary know the concept of *inoculation* and consider similar words as having basically same meaning just being more fancy/foreign/Latin etc., so even when asked specifically about vaccines, they mentaly translate it to *inoculation* and answer modified question.

Because the whole question actually doesn't ask anything important/controversial/notable. At least here, people not trusting governmental institutions when it comes to vaccinations are usually afraid of various side effects, not about the disease itself.

In the UK the Conservatives are part of the ECR and Labour of the S&amp;D. Both can use these party structures in the Council and in the Parliament. So the opposition, is in fact in a better position. The Labour Party is more likely to be able to influence change through S&amp;D than it is through Westminster at this point. A better example is the Greens. Green policies are more likely to be pushed in the EP than Westminster with the 1 MP.

A Conservative government in the UK cannot make a law in Europe without the agreement of socialist governments, and vice versa.

Normally, when you use sampling, the expected accuracy of the poll is almost-completely disconnected from what percentage the sample size is of the population size.

If you have a swimming pool with a million yellow jelly beans and a million black jelly beans, and you take out 1000 beans blindfolded, you'd expect to get *about* 50% of each color.  Pretty much the same thing if you had a billion of each color, or a trillion of each color.

The fact that it is vastly-more-likely for you to get an outcome in your 1000 bean sample that has about the same color proportions as the population as a whole than it is to get one that is wildly-different is why sampling works.

Is it the part about US not admitting guilt or apologizing but paying out the money?

&gt; he U.S. government issued notes of regret for the loss of human lives, but never formally apologized or acknowledged wrongdoing. As part of the settlement, even though the U.S. government did not admit legal liability or formally apologize to Iran, it still agreed to pay US$61.8 million on an ex gratia basis in compensation to the families of the Iranian victims.

Or was it about Ukrainian Army shooting down a Russian plane and also not admitting nor apologizing but still paying out some money?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia_Airlines_Flight_1812

&gt; On 20 November 2003, an ex gratia compensation agreement was signed between the governments of Ukraine and Israel.[5] It was later ratified by the relatives[clarification needed] of the victims who agreed to the conditions. In addition to compensation issues, the agreement has stated that ""Ukraine is not legally responsible for the accident that occurred to the plane and free of any obligations regarding it"".

&gt; On 22 August 2007 Kiev Appeals Court has dismissed the victims' relatives suit against the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, ruling that military of Ukraine bear no liability for the accident.

443,"You're right to ask this question, it's an important issue in Polish politics right now.

As far as American geopolitics are concerned, at least traditionally, Poland is the wedge between Germany and Russia. The two countries have historically sought closer ties with each other, for very pragmatic reasons — Germany has all the capital and know-how, Russia has all the the resources. (This is just as true today as it ever was, the prime example of which is Nord Stream 2, which Poland considers a big stab in the back as far as European unity is concerned.) Closer ties between Germany and Russia would be extremely mutually beneficial, and the Americans fear that a hypothetical alliance between them could be powerful enough to threaten their global hegemony. The key point here is that they do give a crap about us, *insofar as* our interests align, and fortunately for us they do, at least for now.

*The problem is* that now the US attention is increasingly shifting towards the much more pressing threat of China, which kind of throws much of the traditional geostrategy out the window, and now we're faced with the serious possibility that the US will seek to improve their relations and make concessions with Russia, simply because they can't be everywhere at once — as big as the American military is, their resources are not unlimited. This would obviously have bad consequences for Poland and other countries in our region, especially the Baltics. There are some voices within our public discourse that the current government places too much faith in our relations with the US, and calling on them to push for a more realistic and self-reliant approach.",,/r/europe/comments/enn1k2/poland_most_proamerican_country_in_eu_survey/fe6fqo5/,Inhabitant,1578889540

I can't say if noticeably more than in Western countries though.

I have also worked with software/QA engineers from Ukraine, who overall immigrate to Poland pretty massively. Apparently they often make good money at home (in more than relative terms), but the ones I spoke with moved to Poland for lifestyle/social reasons - they didn't go into much detail though, so I assume it's about overall development of the country and possibly stability. 

On the other hand there's definitely a group of people who are willing to move abroad for better money, and in some fields (like civil engineering I mentioned) the incentive can be high, if you're willing to make the leap.

The problem is how heavily fossil fuels have been subsidised as a source of power. Climate change is an externalised cost thay they are not paying for. The tax payer will eventually end up, once again, covering the costs or the tax payer will ~~probably~~ potentially die.

We need an effective carbon tax system, to end subsidies of fossil fuels and to legislate for energy production to be made carbon neutral as soon as possible.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine

&gt; An attenuated vaccine is a vaccine created by reducing the virulence of a pathogen, but still keeping it viable (or ""live"").[1] Attenuation takes an infectious agent and alters it so that it becomes harmless or less virulent. These vaccines contrast to those produced by ""killing"" the virus (inactivated vaccine). 

-

&gt; Disadvantages
&gt;
&gt;* Secondary mutation can cause a reversion to virulence.[9] In this case, the virus can mutate back to the wild type virus or mutate further.

I do.

I'm an atheist who was raised as a Catholic - two things diametrically opposed to their beliefs. But every once in a very long while (they're a really small group around here), they show up on my doorstep and try to win me over. Which of course won't work (and I'm telling them right away), but has never stopped me from inviting them in for a nice cup of tea or coffee. 

I wouldn't say that they're particularly funny or witty people scoring high on the 'easy living' list, but none of them has ever wronged me. They don't try to impose anything on me. They don't throw bombs or endorse violence. They don't topple governments. They just happen to hold beliefs I don't share - at all, in fact. 

I tell them how wrong they are and they tell me that my soul is in grave danger unless I'm saving it, and once that's out of the way, they leave and I bid them farewell and wish them good fortunes, because I do. All of it without ever saying a bad word.

First - I am talking about Poland,and I am from Poland not from USA ! Second - political program is NOTHING especially in Poland. Real activities matter. And there are no real big activities of the left. Old infrastructure with holes in the roads or old electrical grid (and talking about it more than if it is about being ""green"") almost in ruin ? Long waiting for medical help (yes,we have ""free"" medicine,but queues for treatment are months or even years) and medicals working overhours or leaving the country (while PiS government is for example lieing that underpaid protesting young medicals who worked as international volunteers were on exotic trip ?), hundreds of thousands Poles leaving the country every year to almost anywhere because live is so harsh here ? Lacks of persectives other than working on assembly line for peanuts (majoritay works for ~520$/month with bread now for almost 1$ and competing for it with foregainers like Ukrainians imported here almost illegaly by government - with left blessing because is ""promoting multicultural society"" when it's purpose is to keep the salaries low and workers weak) ? Labor laws and safety laws being not respected ? Big and unaffordable prices of renting the flat ? Treating people like a shit by managers and employers (mobbing is forbidden,but really common !) ? Rich elites doing what they want, whole tax system made to feed the rich, where the poor pay most taxes ? Talking about enviromentally friendly cars, heating and electricity while all real cars heating and electrical infrastructure is old,sometimes in ruin and many people have difficulties to afford it ? Banks and swiss frank (hazardous and unlawful) credits ruining some part of middle class (those earning &gt;25-50% more than minimal salary) with their house-mortgages ?

**Our left really don't give a fuck about that**. Even American left does more despite being probably too bunch of liers and hypocrites.Yes - they would sometimes notice.Put something to the program or say something.And they will forget.And will do nothing. If they really notice.They would always simply forget and make show to show how they support homosexuals,or refugees or how eco-activist they are. How they are ""progressive"" and ""european"". **They are like Marie-Antoninette and her ""let them eat cakes"".**

Unfortunatelly with no guillotine perspective for all left/right/whatever (governing) political options.

And yes,yes.I know that some left is doing something for evicted or homeless. This part of the left is small and outside parliament.
Even after affair with bandit ""reprivatisation"" and eviction of people mainstream ""left"" were talking,talking... and forgot.And it is still happening. Such ""left"" we really have in parliament.

**And for me those pointless discusions of elites only about religion or sex/abortion and so on while our country and nation is in real problems, when we are almost screwed already is annoying like hell, and I think those elitist gays wanting to jump  from the fucking fridge with talking about their sexuality and fucking should fuck-off**

He was a radical figure whose attention-grabbing actions, including Nazi salutes at public rallies, were widely covered by Russian state media intent on painting Ukraine as a land where Nazism was on the march. By 2017, Kovalenko had morphed into the role of pan-Slavist. He was eventually sentenced to five years imprisonment for planning to disrupt Ukraine’s military draft.

896,"&gt;It's rare for UK government ministers not to be MPs

Maybe so. But that's doesn't mean that is what they were elected for.

Members of the House of Commons are elected to do three things:

* Make laws and vote budgets
* Provide confidence to a government
* Check on the activities of said government

Any MP that takes on the role of minister does something he was not elected for but something his peers elected him to do.

For the Members of the European Parliament, it's the same thing

* Make laws and vote budgets
* Control the formation of the Commission and provide confidence to it
* Check on the activities of said Commission

Keep in mind that in some countries, members of the government cannot be at the same time members of Parliament and should they be MPs before being chosen to head a ministry, they have to resign as MPs and be replaced in that function, often by a substitute of the same list. Similarly, there are countries whose Prime Ministers are not members of Parliament prior to their nomination (like Italy).

&gt;What demos voted for the EU Commissioners?

As I said above, the demos that voted for EU Commissioner is equivalent to the one that voted for British ministers: the legislative branch (or rather its lower house).

[A *New York Times* article from 2014:](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/greathomesanddestinations/amsterdam-embraces-residential-high-rises.html)

&gt; But as Amsterdam’s mayor, Eberhard van der Laan, noted in a recent televised interview, more high-rises would help the Dutch capital.                           
&gt;                                                                       
&gt;“The power of Amsterdam is that it is actually a very small city,” Mr. Van der Laan said. To preserve that small scale in a place that now has almost 800,000 residents and expects roughly 35,000 more by 2020, the mayor said he sees few possibilities other than “upwards.”                                                
&gt;                                                                                      
&gt;Residents of Amsterdam have long resisted such development, many linking high-rise living with the vast concrete facades of the Bijlmermeer project and the problems of integration and crime that it experienced in the 1970s and early ’80s.                                                                              
&gt;
&gt; And while such development is still strongly discouraged in central Amsterdam, with its tourist-magnet network of 17th-century canals, other parts of the city already are changing.                                                              
&gt;
&gt;A 75-meter-tall building, a joint effort by the real estate developer AM, part of the Royal BAM Group, and the asset management company MN, is planned for a site about 1.6 kilometers, or one mile, northeast of the city’s central Dam Square. Work on the building, which has not yet been named, is to start in early 2015 and be completed the next year.                                               
&gt;                                                                                      
&gt;The area around the Rembrandt Tower, southeast of Dam Square, is targeted for two projects, although construction dates have not been announced. Provast, a Dutch real estate developer, expects to have 192 rental apartments and a hotel in its 100-meter-tall Amstel Tower, named for the nearby river. And a 160-apartment tower, 70 meters high, also is planned by a consortium of real estate developers including Lingotto, APF International and Hurks.
&gt;

1062,"Britain must invest in military hardware to become less reliant on U.S. air cover and spy planes in future conflicts, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was quoted as saying in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.

A steadfast ally of the United States that places its “special relationship” with Washington at the heart of its foreign policy, Britain has also traditionally been a pillar and strong advocate of NATO.

But in unusually frank comments, Wallace said fears that the United States under President Donald Trump would pursue increasingly isolationist policies kept him awake at night, according to the Sunday Times.

“I worry if the United States withdraws from its leadership around the world, that would be bad for the world and bad for us. We plan for the worst and hope for the best,” Wallace was quoted as saying.

“Over the last year we’ve had the U.S. pull out from Syria, the statement by Donald Trump on Iraq where he said NATO should take over and do more in the Middle East.”

He said the assumption that Britain would always be part of a U.S. coalition was no longer valid and the government should plan accordingly.

“We are very dependent on American air cover and American intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets. We need to diversify our assets,” Wallace said.

1117,"Text:

Boris Johnson is considering hiring a new adviser in Downing Street to put the Union at the heart of policy making as he formally rejects Nicola Sturgeon's demand for the right to call a second Scottish referendum.

The Prime Minister has drafted a three page letter which will reject the Scottish First Minister's demand for a second vote on independence.

Mr Johnson will issue a robust response, as early as this week, in which he will make clear that he will not allow the vote because it would undermine the centuries-old Union between England and Scotland.

The letter makes clear that the Scottish Parliament should not given the right to choose the date and the context of a repeat of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.

Ms Sturgeon's demanded a second referendum in a report - titled Scotland's Right to Choose - sent to Number 10 days after last month's general election.

Ms Sturgeon wants another vote to take place next year, which the report argued would allow the ""smoothest transition"" for a separate Scotland to become an EU member in its own right.

The SNP leader intends to campaign to win over civic Scotland and the other political parties ahead of next year's Scottish elections to the Holyrood Parliament.  

To bolster links between England and Scotland, Mr Johnson who styles himself as Minister for the Union, is also planning to hire a new policy special adviser to put preserving the Union at the heart of Government policy.

Tory MPs who lost their seats at last month's general elections are being considered for the new £80,000 a year role.

A Cabinet sub-committee to focus on measures to cement the Union could also be established.

A review by former Number 10 aide Lord Dunlop into how the machinery of Government can be reformed to protect better the Union is also due to be published next month.

One source said the review would ""embed thinking about the Union back into the heart and soul of Number 10"".

Last week Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, was pressed by SNP MPs over when the response to Ms Sturgeon would be published during Scottish questions in Parliament.

He replied: “We are very clear about this; constitutional matters are reserved.

""It would be completely wrong for us to hand those powers over to the Scottish Parliament because we would end up in a series of neverendums; bad for the Scottish, bad for Scottish jobs, reducing tax income and, therefore, damaging already failing public services.”",,/r/europe/comments/ennmwb/boris_johnson_may_hire_new_downing_street_adviser/fe2cp6r/,casualphilosopher1,1578836907

1122,"I’d say you can always find the golden standard, what the majority thinks. In a country as conservative as Poland this would probably be the voices of the big cities and their suburbs only. In much more liberal Norway maybe probably much more widespread. Actually funny thing, it’s easier for me to see this on a continent level than on a country one do to stereotypes. I’ve been living in Warsaw, Poland for 7 years now, supposedly in a conservative country. The (much hated by the majority) new Sunday trade ban for supermarkets made by the conservative government in 2018 is the only sign the country is conservative for me. My Warsaw friends are overwhelmingly pro Western, and have Western views on abortion and LGBT rights. Say Warsaw Pride, is 45-50K strong these days, with minimal police presence and maybe like 10 counter protestors standing somewhere. On the other hand from smaller cities like Bialystok I see parades attacked by neo Nazi football hooligans that have to be protected by a heavy police presence. It’s less than 300 km away, but seems like to be somewhere in Russia when you see it in the news. So for me in general the European view on stuff is the common opinion in most of the West and in the East in many cities, which is in general quite liberal and disliking war. As for not getting involved in US conflicts, the funny thing is, even in divided Poland, both groups are like 90 percent for not getting involved. Sadly the Polish government not only this one loves to get involved in US wars (see Iraq) which might be it’s biggest disconnection with the people.

Supposing I leave a camera in someone else's bedroom and record them engaging in various sexual acts without their consent.

It seems to me that generally people would consider that objectionable, even if I don't publish the video.

*googles*

In at least some US states, the recording appears to be illegal.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellecitron/2014/05/15/nonconsensual-taping-of-sex-partners-is-a-crime/#fa79c1d6ce08

&gt;During the spring of 2010, Colgate University student Michael Piznarski secretly recorded his sexual encounter with a woman in his bedroom (Jane Doe #1). That summer, Piznarski and Jane Doe #1 broke up. In the fall, he sent her Facebook messages informing her about the video and insinuated that he was going to post it online. After Jane Doe #1 filed a complaint with local police, the police obtained a search warrant for Piznarski's apartment where they retrieved a small digital camera, external hard drive, and laptop computer. A search of the laptop revealed multiple video files of Piznarski having sex with Jane Doe #1 and one file featuring him engaged in sex with another woman (Jane Doe #2). Neither woman knew about the recordings, let alone consented to them.
&gt;
&gt;Piznarski was convicted under New York's unlawful surveillance statute called Stephanie's Law, which makes it illegal to use a device to secretly record or broadcast a person undressing or having sex when that person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. The statute is named after Stephanie Fuller whose landlord installed a camera in the smoke detector in her bedroom to watch her. He was sentenced to one to three years for taping himself having sex with Jane Doe #1 and an additional year for recording himself with Jane Doe #2. The court ordered the defendant to pay restitution to the women and certified him as a sex offender.
&gt;
&gt;Piznarski appealed the verdict. Stephanie's Law, he argued, did not apply to surreptitious recordings of consensual sexual encounters. The appeals court rejected the argument. The statute did not just apply to Peeping Toms but to secret tapings of sexual encounters. A governor's memorandum written in support of the bill listed various scenarios the bill was meant to cover including New York women who previously had no protection when they were secretly recorded during sex. In upholding the sentence, the court noted the ""devastating and profound effect of defendant's actions upon the victims.""

Now, granted, we don't know for sure whether the Cyprus situation was:

1. The woman was aware of the recording and did not object at the time, but later was worried about her reputation.

2. The woman was aware of the latter portion of the recording, but found out that she was being recorded once the video was already being taken, and felt that by that she had no recourse at that point, as there was already some record in existence.

3. The woman was unaware of the recording until later.

Because each of those has rather different implications.  In (1) I'm not very sympathetic to the woman on the recording issue, but in (3) I am.  In (2), I could see a world where the law has a presumption of non-consent to recording, and that working.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/enfu22/british_woman_found_guilty_of_lying_about_gang/fe2f0tv/,duisThias,1578837677

The USSR played a central role in defeating Nazism, there is no doubt about that. But it wouldn't have happened if Hitler never attacked the USSR, they were fine with nazis after the partition of Eastern Europe until 22 june 1941. 

Still, without soviet sacrifice, Europe would never have gotten rid of nazism, but it was no liberation, it was only occupation. The Baltic states, Eastern Poland and parts of Romania in 1940, all of Europe east of the iron curtain in 1948 and 1949.

Your people's sacrifice does not make all the wrongdoings, the injustice, the purges or the terror go away. It does not make the murder and killings, the show trials and executions, the suppression of smaller states' autonomy go away. It makes neither 1949 nor 1956 nor 1962 nor 1968 nor 1979 go away.

Muscat knew he couldn’t last for ever. He always said he’d run for 2 elections and then resign (he hasn’t completed a single term). He needed someone who will continue to protect him after he’s gone.

i agree lets end Freedom of movement, no?

you wanna see what really happens to a country that takes too many immigrants in a short amount of time? ask the UK, they got a million Poles in 10 years time, and got fed up and fucked off because they werent allowed to stop EU immigration.

and in regards to the recent refugee and immigration crisis, i agree. but put it into context, it was the worst humanitarian crisis since WWII, thats not something that happens often. and its not going to happen again, not for another 80 years

and its immigration any member state can stop at any point in time. no one is forced to take any non EU immigrant in.

the EU had been calm in regards to non EU immigration for decades before 2015, people seem to have forgotten that.

&gt;especialy if they don't assimilate.

in what regard? culturally? socially? i dont care as long as there arent that many of them and they keep to themselves. and the majority do mind their own business. live their lives and go about it.

it becomes a problem when there are too many of them that arrive in a short amount of time, especially if they cannot be stopped at the border by EU law. like Freedom of movement.

Russia has essentially not moved on from 1945 mentally speaking. They are unable to let go of that moment. They are unable to accept that they committed massive atrocities. For them, the Soviet Union was a benign experiment that unfortunately failed despite good intentions instead of being a murderous totalitarian regime just like the Nazis.

Despite the fact that the Soviets murdered more civilians than the Nazis - many of them Russians - the deep-seated propaganda is so hard to dislodge that any attempt, even the mildest kind of soft questioning, provokes a primal and uncontrolled reaction of pure rage.

Yes, and the historical, albeit minority, Francophone culture of Flemish cities (Ghent, Leuven...) was eradicated by a strong ""dutchification"", yet no one talks about the ""eradication of French culture of the Netherlands"". It's only a problem when Francophones do it.

Also this ""dutchification"" was strongly incentived by German occupations in both world wars (Flamenpolitik), it was literally a Nazi policy; and in 1968, the Francophones were literally kicked out physically from the Leuven university, as a continuation of the expulsion of Francophones of the university of Ghent in 1917 imposed by the German invaders.... (supposedly because ""Leuven university is historically Flemish!"". Little irony: the university was founded in 1425 and during four centuries the language was... latin)

1408,"The problem is there are two kinds of bilingualism. The historical trilingualism of Brittany was just three different monolingualisms, nobody really spoke several different languages, and this rarely works long term. The re was a real disconnect between the French speaking bourgeoisie (and aristocracy before that) and the people, as well as between Gallo and Breton speaking people. It's a situation similar to Quebec, Belgium (where I live) or Catalonia, and tensions are bound to arise. The standard answer to this in the 19th century was to stamp out local languages, in France as well as elsewhere, and it actually worked out well for the countries that did it, even if it caused the loss of a lot of culture.

But the ideal result, having bilingual *people* (rather than different monolingual people who just cohabit), is actually very difficult to implement, so much that I'm not sure I can name a place that manages it. It's what Ireland tries to do for example, but even there the level of people in Irish is terrible.

Battle of Agnadello in 1509

1481,"Further recordings of police brutality against protesting French people are circulating in social media. French judges are also among the victims. ""We are sending an open letter to the European Commission requesting immediate intervention"" - informed MEP Patryk Jaki.

The subject of violence by the French police has been raised on the web for months. General strikes are currently taking place across the country in response to the pension reform being pushed through by President Emmanuel Macron. Public opposition is met with a strong reaction of the police. In recent days, the latter have even clashed with demonstrating judges and lawyers.

One of the films shows how dozens of gendarmes are pushing lawyers out of the Court of Appeal hall, one of the buildings within the Palais de Justice (Palace of Justice) in Paris. The video moved the Internet users. Now, PiS MEPs, Patryk Jaki and Beata Kempa, have also decided to intervene in the case.

They wrote a letter to Commissioner Vera Jurowa and the President of the European Parliament requesting immediate intervention on the events in France and the debates on the rule of law in that country. ""In view of further physical attacks by the state on its citizens, and yesterday on lawyers and attorneys at the court in France, we are sending out an open letter"" - informed Patryk Jaki on Facebook.

""This was another abuse of the French state, after the brutal pacification of the so-called 'yellow vests' protests. Such behaviour was not only out of proportion to the threat, but also affected the fundamental rights of the European Union"" - stressed the MEP.

Patryk Jaki said that in Poland judges also protest, and what is more, they do not have the right to do so and by engaging in anti-government rallies they ""break the constitution"". ""And yet, the Polish government decided to protect the demonstration (with which it deeply disagrees) and not to use force, as it happened in France"" - stressed Jaki.

Let us remind you that the brutality of the French services started to be loudly heard during the ""yellow vests"" protests. Recordings of how policemen throw a disabled person off a wheelchair, drag women by their hair or kick an old man circulated on the Internet. Many people were injured by rubber bullets and, according to the protesters, at least ten demonstrators died as a result of police intervention.

Adam Andruszkiewicz, Deputy Minister of Digitization, also spoke on the subject of strikes of judges in Poland and Europe. ""No wonder that judges from the West came to Poland for ‘The March of a Thousand Togas'. No one will attack them with a knife, the police won't club them and disperse them with water cannons - as it happens in their countries"" - he wrote on Twitter. ""They'll walk around and have dinner at an exquisite restaurant in the evening.

Right. And if one option is far more expensive than the other, they choose the cheaper one more often. Maybe not certain individuals, but in the aggregate, even small price fluctuations can have a giant impact. These choices are behaviors themselves.

I think it's more apparent that you don't know what behaviorism is or what behaviors are considered. Especially since your last sentence literally just affirms what I said.

I never said anyone was banned from anywhere. I said the *languages* in question were banned from being used for official business. You know, like in every other civilized country. Good luck trying to conduct a trial in Gaelic or sign contracts in Sorbian.

Having an all-purpose language for operations where the States acts as a third party is pretty nice, and it's also nice for it to be something people haven't stopped speaking a thousand years ago.

There's a reason French (and English) is growing quite fast in areas of Africa where there's a large diversity of natives languages. And it's not us oppressing them through thin air generations after we fucked off. But maybe we're *that* strong, who knows.

&gt;The emancipation movements against francophone classist oppression predate Wallonia's decline.

Yeah, the whole wave of Romantic nationalism hit Flanders like everywhere else. Which didn't mean shit until Flanders had economic agency a generation ago.

&gt;It was deliberately imposed by a very small ruling class as a policy, not a ""natural development"".

Flanders had been in the French cultural sphere a millennium before Belgium existed. I'll probably have fuming Flemings angrily pressing the down-vote button for saying it, but those who know more history than the Fantastical Tales of the Sluys know I'm right.

&gt;Wallonia, by the way, also lost its natural language due to frenchifying policies.

It's like saying Northumberland lost its language due to English tyranny.

&gt;It's not different than Ireland now speaking English rather than Irish.

It is extremely different.

&gt;an elite in a giant capital imposing its linguistic preferences on everyone else

French didn't come ""from the capital"". That's a fallacy that keeps being parroted around because it makes things awfully convenient and simple, though royal policies certainly helped. But our national language is French rather than Occitan or a pan-Gallic Romance language (like German is in Germany) because the North had massive arable lands and the Islamic pirates neutered the South. I really don't see a pattern of governments that would change anything to Northern Gaul culturally dominating the surroundings over time. And people from all over the country have been willing and active participants to its transformations. The notion that a handful of guys in Paris unilaterally changed the language of millions of people is properly laughable.

Frankly speaking, printing and peddlers did far more for setting up English, French, German etc. as universal standards in their respective areas than any policy.

1593,"&gt; That is to say, it's not really efficient to build new ""affordable"" housing. 

By efficient you mean profitable? If so, yes. That's my point. There is a very weak profit incentive which is why the government must step in to overrule the market because there is a greater social need. Same as it does in health care.

&gt; I was on a thread the other day with someone complaining about rental prices in Dublin and how it was the fault of neoliberalism that prices were so high. Of course, a quick google reveals that Dublin doesn't allow construction higher than 10 stories.

A lot of Ireland's problems is due to very rapid population growth. They have the highest natural increase in the EU *and* very high rates of migration. Fixing the housing crisis can only be partly be done through government-owned housing á la Singapore. Migration also needs to be tamped down. Singapore has much lower rates of migration than many countries which have gotten a lot of immigrants lately.

Some of this is just the numbers effect. Lots of people in a short time pushes up crowdedness. Some of it is a composition effect (white flight to better areas).",,/r/europe/comments/en5ugl/intense_development_in_the_wola_district_of_warsaw/fe04s5q/,yuropemodssuck,1578803066

That is KEY to being able to finance a deficit that allows you to invest in public services beyond what you tax without scaring away foreign investment again. 


Thus economies like yours with a surplus can choose to either 'spend' it on public services **(at a sustainable level this time, please)** or lose some revenue by decreasing taxes on lower classes and businesses. As long as your debt to GDP raatio stays at around or below 90%, both options will stimulate your economy -but if you are a very high taxed economy its strongly reccomended that first taxes are lowered on businesses so you then can use the increased foreign investment from that to build on public services. Not to mention if current tax rates are crippling small businesses right now, a small cut in those tax rates can potentially **increase** tax revenues as some small businesses could afford to stop evading taxes. This is all dependent on the economy effectively lowering corruption and tax loopholes though.

It turns out even worse. According to the implementation report of the national program for counteracting violence, which on January 7, 2020 at the Family Commission presented the Ministry of Family and Social Security, it appears that

&gt;**in 2018, 6% did not undertake similar programs** **all municipalities in Poland.** **This means that 148 people in the country are experiencing violence without support.**

""And what did the state do to enforce the rules? Thread. This is a very worrying signal that the central administration sends to local governments. Often the only thing that prompted municipalities to take a proactive policy is the obligation under the Act.

\- says OKO.press Renata Durda, manager of the Emergency Service for Victims of Violence ""Blue Line"".

This is not the only alarming signal that comes from reading the government report:

* the availability of specialist support centers for victims of domestic violence is falling (mainly due to underfunding);
* corrective and educational programs for perpetrators of violence are fiction;
* the services are less and less willing to use the Blue Card procedure because they know that it is not effective.

**Anton Ambroziak, OKO.press: Family is a priority - it's a slogan that the government repeats like a mantra.** **How does this declaration relate to the reality of people experiencing violence?**

**Renata Durda** : The object of government protection is only a Catholic, large family. In the definition of PiS politicians and the extreme right, violence only occurs in cohabitation or dysfunctional families, which the former are certainly not, so of course, why deal with them?

Of course, we have various practical variations of this attitude. They are like Mr Braun, who at the Commission argued that the state should not interfere in the life of the family at all. And there is also a majority of the government that believes that it is worth taking care of the family when good things can be supported and the elimination of bad things is not even an unpleasant duty for the state.

**Domestic violence was also to be a priority.** **Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki spoke about it in the** [**first exposé**](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=pl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://oko.press/morawiecki-oglasza-zero-przemocy-wobec-kobiet-rzad-sporo-zrobil-zeby-przemocy-bylo-wiecej-niz-zero/&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700256,15700259,15700262,15700265,15700271&amp;usg=ALkJrhh_fSlqn08QZHgjB6fxQUzPNZhrng) **.**

The declaration has never translated into action. And even at such a crucial point as protecting children against violence. For the government, which clearly states that the main goal is to increase fertility, it would seem prudent to address the quality of life of living children. For many years we have been appealing, among others for the creation of a National Strategy for the Protection of Children against Violence. With no effect.

**And yet, on January 7 at the Commission, the ministry boasted of microsuccess.** **The most noticeable was the information that the number of ""Blue Cards"" procedures initiated was decreasing.** **In 2014, there were over 99,000, and in 2018 - 93,000.** **Should we really accept this data with enthusiasm?** **Less Blue Cards, less violence?**

This is a good example of the fact that every fact without context can be interpreted in a thousand ways. The decreasing number of Blue Card procedures initiated may indicate that the number of families experiencing violence is decreasing.

**And so it is?**

We have no evidence of this. It may well be that the procedure turned out to be ineffective and, as a consequence, the services and people experiencing violence were offended by it.

**The ministry suggested it was good.** **Director Marzena Bartosiewicz representing the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy said that the decrease in the number of ""Blue Cards"" is associated with an increase in public awareness and the ability to distinguish between conflict and violence.**

It may be that at the beginning of the service initiating procedures: police, social assistance, education, health care and alcohol problem solving committees, poorly diagnosed the problem and sometimes initiated the Blue Cards procedure exaggerated.",,/r/europe/comments/enhttb/not_only_zakopane_over_140_communes_in_poland/fdzwwaf/,bm52oc,1578797763
1703,"It may also be that the services have thickened the diagnostic sieve. Why?

&gt;Because law enforcement treats the perpetrators of indulgence, many cases are discontinued, and if the sentences are already passed after a few months or sometimes years.

This frustrates not only family members, but also people who work on the procedure.

Often, police say they do not want to take the so-called lighter cases, i.e. those in which there are single, but mentally severe episodes of violence. They say they have 30 similar cases, and a thousand other things to do. Why should I monitor another case now, make thousands of notes, since the prosecutor will screw the case anyway? So maybe in the statistics we can see only extreme cases in which the services are sure that the perpetrator will go to prison. If this happens, it means that the ""Blue Cards"" procedure does not fulfill its function.

**Another thing is that we do not have any statistics that would allow us to estimate the scale of violence and measure the effectiveness of ""Blue Cards"".**

I am the greatest pessimist in this matter. Most of the research commissioned by the ministry is, to put it mildly, unreliable. Mainly because the money spent on research is inadequate to market rates, and there is little time to prepare it, so the quality of research and reports is poor.

A study in the area of ​​violence is not just a consumer survey called ""what cottage cheese you eat and what bread you buy."" We ask about socially and personally sensitive matters. You need to know how to encourage people to give real, not just the right answers, and how not to victimize them again.

In 2019, three tests were carried out and each of them revealed a problem that I signal. The bars describing the scale of violence, which soared above 50%, revealed the image we know from Scandinavian countries.

&gt;Why suddenly such a large awareness of violence in our society and a desire to openly talk about it, since we previously turned in data at a level of several percent?

It turns out that the study was conducted on the Internet and did not take into account the specifics of the network and any other variables.

**Should the red light also come on when presenting other data?** **E.g. only 3,000** **perpetrators in 2018 benefited from corrective and educational programs.**

First of all, in 2018 we had over 11,000 convictions from art. 207 of the Penal Code, i.e. the court has undeniably found that there were so many perpetrators of domestic violence. The obligation to use therapy or correction programs should be stuck to such a judgment, but it is not. The 3,000 people who benefited from the program made the effort of the immediate environment or services involved in the Blue Card procedure. There is no state merit in it, because the law does not work.

I'm even more worried about the way we implement corrective and educational programs. According to the regulation, they last for 8-12 weeks, and the poviat gets money to implement only one edition per year.

&gt;This means that if someone was convicted in November, and the program was carried out in June, then the next one will have to wait a year. Can you imagine that someone ready to change is waiting a year to be included in the program for perpetrators of domestic violence?

It is also absurd to believe that in two or three months you can change the attitude established throughout your life: the way you think about the role of man and woman, about what can be in a close relationship and what you can't. This is unreal. The perpetrators of violence with whom I speak often admit that they need at least two years of continuous work to change the way they think about themselves and the world. I do not believe in the effectiveness of occasional activities.

**And what lies behind the decreasing number of people using the help of specialist support centers for victims of domestic violence?**

Underfunding. Many of them are considering resigning from running 24/7 help centers open 365 days a year, because they are not enough for salaries. The minimum wage increase? Great, but for such centers it means that they have to cut the salaries of psychologists and lawyers in order to be able to pay the watchman who cares about the safety of the facility. And what happens when we have less and less money? The quality of services is decreasing, and the number of customers is behind it.

As a rule, we want the facilities not to serve as hostels, because the place of people experiencing violence is at home. But the services of the institutions are also used by people who come for specialist advice and there are less of them in general. And this is a very bad signal, which means that the availability of help is decreasing.

**For many years, it was the social organizations that helped the state to help.**

And with great enthusiasm. NGOs basically created a system to help people experiencing violence and enthusiastically filled all deficiencies in the state system. But the time when we could be pioneers is over. For over 4 years, we've been dealing mainly with tying end to end. We solve budget puzzles: how to pay rent and electricity.

&gt;Money from the state budget, mainly from the Justice Fund or the Civic Initiatives Fund, has been redirected to organizations that support the family model promoted by the government. They provide cultural and caring services.",,/r/europe/comments/enhttb/not_only_zakopane_over_140_communes_in_poland/fdzwxii/,bm52oc,1578797788
1704,"For them, the sack with money has dissolved, and for us, organizations that have been involved in counteracting violence and supporting victims for years, there is less money. We also lacked external funds, mainly Norwegian funds ...

**... because the government has extended negotiations with the Norwegians over the next tranche and the money will not return until 2020.** **What else should worry us about today's report?**

I was most worried about the number of municipalities that, despite the statutory obligation, did not adopt local programs for preventing violence and protecting victims of domestic violence.

**In recent years we have heard that only Zakopane is not fulfilling this obligation.**

And we lived in this belief. The report shows that

&gt;in 2018, there are no programs in 6 percent municipalities, i.e. slightly counting in more than 100 places in the country.

**Exactly 148.**

And what did the state do to enforce the rules? Thread. This is a very worrying signal that the central administration sends to local governments. Often the only thing that prompted municipalities to take a proactive policy is the obligation under the Act. And since over 100 communes have not been silently implementing it for x years, does it mean that you can avoid the rules without any consequences?

I think that the previous idea went away with the former deputy minister Elżbieta Bojanowska, who was allowed to maneuver the lawyers from Ordo Iuris and the councilor of Zakopane.

**This does not mean that MRPiPS does not improve the unfortunate document.**

The history of that law showed that there are drawers in the ministries from which a monster can always jump out. However, it seems to me that nothing new has been created this year, because no new representative for the implementation of the National Program for the Prevention of Domestic Violence has been appointed in place of Ms Bojanowska. Her duties in 2019 were performed by deputy minister Marcin Zieleniecki, but she clearly indicates that she is only a substitute.

**In 2019, however, the Monitoring Team of which you are a member created a draft of the new National Program for the Prevention of Domestic Violence for the years 2021-2028.**

This is largely a continuation of the Program for 2014-2020. There were cosmetic changes and timid suggestions in it, because the program must be in the applicable legal order. You cannot insert mandatory tasks into it, but only suggest additional solutions. That is why we proposed creation of year-round and truly available preventive and therapeutic programs for perpetrators. Now everything is in the hands of the ministry.

**A representative of the Ministry of Justice said today that the ministry is working on a long-awaited solution, i.e. immediate isolation of perpetrators of violence already at the stage of police intervention.**

This is of course good information, but I do not know if another one submitted in the electoral procedure. Minister Ziobro introduced it already in June 2019. It was to be implemented in a moment. Today is January 2020 and we are hearing a similar declaration again. I would like to see a ready document.

**So what are the real tasks government should set for itself?**

Dream or realistic?

**What is the difference?**

&gt;In today's political reality, sometimes it is better not to bury something, so that the right-wing screams do not turn a good idea into solutions straight from regime Russia.

What is safe and what to do now is definitely a change in the regulation on the ""Blue Cards"" procedure. Forms have been out of date for several years, thus misleading people experiencing violence.

I would also like the ministry to adopt an ambitious financial plan so that the money is enough to run real social campaigns, and local governments get funds that take into account inflation and changes in the labor market. It is a shame for a lawyer in a specialist support center for victims of violence to earn a minimum wage.

**And dreams?**

Immediate isolation of perpetrators of violence from victims. I used to be an absolute advocate of this change, but today I talk about it with greater shyness. When I look at the personnel change in the police in the last two or three years, I start to hear voices that previously seemed ridiculous to me, i.e. that the Polish police are not ready for such broad powers. In other words, I'm not sure if there will be any abuse. If this is to succeed, the entitlement to issue an order to leave the apartment must be supplemented with training for officers, mainly young people who are on emergency patrols.

**And what is certainly impossible today?**

Large prevention and educational programs.

**At school, you can actually dream about education about violence.**

Of course, we need to introduce a kind of debate to kindergartens, schools and public space yesterday that would support the goal of counteracting domestic violence and violence against women, but I think that only a snout today is possible, as with Mr Braun on the Commission.

**So the strategy is to minimize losses and wait?**

I don't want to speak for all ""helpers"", but I think that's what I do. Every day I put out a small fire. For several months, the ""Blue Line"" has been basically homeless, so I mainly find a new place for us. However, I appreciate the energy of young activists who require more, because honestly we have new tools.

We still have the Istanbul Convention, which gives us the possibility of real change. The question is whether it is worth to support her, appeal in court cases or the operation of services, if it can only harm us. Today we are in the clinch.

&gt;We talk about her, but quiet enough not to annoy anyone. The strategy for survival is good like any other, although I would prefer us to act progressively.",,/r/europe/comments/enhttb/not_only_zakopane_over_140_communes_in_poland/fdzwy9e/,bm52oc,1578797803

## Speech by prof. Robert Grzeszczak

I have analyzed the Act in the light of EU law. My conclusions are unambiguous, at least in relation to EU law. Regarding the potential effects that may occur in connection with the adoption and entry into force of this Act, there are certain scenarios.

I can say that they are very likely, but they are not prejudged.

My first conclusion is dramatic and short:

&gt;**the Act of 20 December 2019 is grossly contrary to EU law,**

and also with international law as regards our obligations arising from the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as with national law, is contrary to the Constitution.

The Act interferes with the sphere of judicial independence so far, the EU **principle of loyalty** , and thus the principle that is the basis for cooperation between states and between states and the EU.

And also the **principle of the primacy of EU law** , the effectiveness of this law, its direct effectiveness.

These are the principles that shaped the way the EU works and its law. We are creating the Union, i.e. the Member States. Our law, which we are here, is only half truth, and therefore it is not true that we have Polish law only.

In the 21st century, our legal system is really made up of three systems.

* We have a law that applies in Poland, that is Polish law,
* we have EU law
* and there is international law that we have bound to.

*On Saturday, January 11 at* *15:00 from the Supreme Court through Krakowskie Przedmieście under the Presidential Palace until the Sejm and the Senate will march the Thousand Tóg March under the slogan ""Right to independence, right to Europe"".*

*We will silently protest against the ""disciplining"" act, the repression of judges and prosecutors, as well as the violation of the rule of law and the separation of powers in Poland, as well as leading Poland out of the European legal space.*",,/r/europe/comments/enhw9a/professor_grzeszczak_the_entry_into_force_of_the/fdzxdjj/,bm52oc,1578798109

I'm not an expert on this but from what I know some cities have a dedicated district with skyscrapers like the La Defense in Paris for example, and it would seem the best solution imo but still, other than in a bunch of cities (London, Paris, Moscow, Frankfurt, Warsaw) there are almost no skyscrapers in Europe, and they're not planning to do much about it from what I know

It's not about not having the money obviously as there are currently more skyscrapers in poorer countries as well, for example Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia in Asia, it's just either not having the need to build them or not wanting to do it.

The original building of the canal itself was entirely a *financial* project, and the people that built it went bankrupt because the canal almost immediately became useless for transport due to being so narrow. And there's absolutely been an issue [to have it widened](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2018-001911_EN.html), but Greece has not exactly had the economy to even discuss it much in recent decades.

1846,"&gt; The port of Hamburg &amp; the port of Valencia are both among the top 5 busiest in Europe.

And neither is anywhere remotely close to being able to catch up to Rotterdam. Antwerp is the 2nd busiest port in Europe. *It handles less than half the cargo Rotterdam does*, and it is significantly busier than Hamburg. As for Valencia, I don't know where you got the idea it's in the top 5. It's the 10th busiest; Rotterdam is literally 7.5 times busier. The 5th busiest port is Algecircas (Rotterdam is about 5.3 times busier than that). The 4rd busiest, incidentally, is Amsterdam.

&gt; As Southern Europe and Eastern Europe become richer, wouldn’t those ports become more important than Western Europe ports such as Rotterdam?

No. Not unless Western Europe collapsed somehow. Even if other parts of Europe have faster growing economies, that's only because they're catching up, the growth differential isn't something that can be maintained indefinitely, and these economies are not going to be able to grow to a point where such ports could realistically match the traffic of Rotterdam (especially given we might well see a contraction of global shipping in the mid to long term).

Besides just that, there are other factors limiting their growth. It's no coincidence that 3 of the 5 largest port are in the Rhine/Meuse Delta; put those together and they're as big as the next 15 ports combined. As I pointed out, other ports simply don't have the geography. For one, as I pointed out, Rotterdam is the only European port with the ability to accomodate the largest and heaviest ships in the world. In theory *some* ports could be modified to accomodate these vessels as well... but the cost would be prohibitive especially given there's little guarantee they could attract such ships to recoup the costs. 

But also the other big ports simply don't have the physical space to grow into. 

Antwerp is blocked from large-scale expansion by the Dutch border. 

Hamburg can't without destroying either a *lot* of homes, or a protected nature reserve. In theory they could build a second port further downstream; but that'd be a separate port from Hamburg, and the growth potential doesn't justify it. 

Amsterdam could theoretically grow; it has a relatively unobstructed path to the North-Sea that could allow it to add much more capacity than the other ports could add; but with Rotterdam right next door is unlikely to attract enough traffic to justify the cost. 

Algecircas could theoretically expand into the bay of Gibraltar, though that would still mean it can't physically grow to be the size of Rotterdam; and of course has the same problem of its effect on tourism. Another huge limiting factor is the fact it simply doesn't have the highly developed hinterland connections of ports like Rotterdam or Antwerp. 

Finally, Valencia, (not one of the big ones but since you mentioned it) would likewise have to destroy a protected nature reserve, and/or most of its tourist appeal in the process; not to mention its location makes it pretty unappealing for a massive cargo port to begin with. 

In contrast to all of those ports, there's no reason why Rotterdam couldn't just continue expanding out into sea like it's been doing.",Flevoland (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/en7rhg/germany_netherlands_and_france_are_europes/fdyfobp/,nybbleth,1578779283

&gt; The foreign policy goal of the Soviet Union was set forth by Joseph Stalin in a speech on 19 January 1925 that if another world war broke out between the capitalist states that: ""We will enter the fray at the end, throwing our critical weight onto the scale, a weight that should prove to be decisive"".[12] To promote this goal which would lead to the global triumph of Communism, the Soviet Union tended to support German efforts to challenge the Versailles system by assisting German secret rearmament, a policy that caused much tension with France.

1894,"&gt; No, Rotterdam is huge port because of the geography

I literally said that no other port has the geography that Rotterdam does (geography which, among other things means it can accomodate the largest vessels).

&gt; Other countries can invest in port facilities 

A little bit, yes. But none of the other ""big"" ports (outside of Antwerp and Hamburg, (none of the other ports really qualify as big really) have the *physical space to expand into*. They're blocked by the geography; there's towns and nature reserves in the way, or the waterways would have to be radically widened to be able to grow significantly; and that'd be prohibitively expansive. Future growth in these ports will come mainly from increased automation, (which incidentally Rotterdam has been a leading pioneer in for decades), and that can only take that growth so far. And that's ignoring the fact that aside from Antwerp (and maybe Hamburg) none of them have the hinterland connections that have made Rotterdam as big as it is.

&gt; Other countries can invest in port facilities and make laws these companies will be obliged to comply.

Rotterdam's port authorities would throw the most epic party if other countries tried to make laws like what you're suggesting; you'd be driving traffic *to* Rotterdam, not away from it.

It still was enough, i guess:

&gt; Soviet neutrality between 1939 and 1941 helped Germany to avoid a two front war, concentrating most of the Wehrmacht eastward in 1941, while Soviet imports to Germany proved vital to the German invasion of the Soviet Union.[197] Ironically, despite fears causing the Soviet Union to enter deals with Germany in 1939, that Germany came so close to destroying the Soviet Union was due largely to Soviet actions taken from 1939 to 1941.[197] Soviet raw materials supplies had helped convince German generals, who previously had refused to even discuss a Soviet invasion, to go along with Hitler's plans.[197] **Soviet imports into Germany, especially oil, proved essential for the Wehrmacht's conduct of the coming invasion.[198] Without Soviet imports, German stocks would have run out in several key products by October 1941, within three and a half months.[193] Germany would have already run through their stocks of rubber and grain before the first day of the invasion were it not for Soviet imports:[193]**

The US administration might change, but the US won't change.  Trump is just the symptom of a problem that goes deeper.

Canada and Norway are trade light-weights (no sleight intended). The EU already has close trading relations and trade arbitration mechanism with both countries. The EU needs to establish a global network of trade agreements so that most countries, especially the heavy weights, are bound by a regulatory framework that can replace the WTO.

2015,"&gt; U.S. Officials and Military Personnel Face Charges in Foreign Courts; United States Will Not Extradite;

You're misunderstanding the issue there.

That does not state that the US does not extradite nationals.  It's saying that the US won't permit courts in Iraq to try soldiers who were fighting in Iraq.

What you're talking about is not a question of extradition, but a policy that the US doesn't permit courts somewhere to try soldiers fighting in that location.  You're gonna have people that don't like your soldiers, and they couldn't function if courts had jurisdiction.  You might object to that -- I do not, and think that it'd be impractical to fight wars without it -- but that's not a result of  disallowing extradition of citizens.

You can find places where the US will not grant jurisdiction where some other court would like jurisdiction, sure.  I can give a couple:

* German courts have claimed jurisdiction over copyright on computers in the US if connected to the Internet, and the US has rejected this jurisdictional claim; I remember this from a spat over the *Gutenberg Project* where a US server had a book that was not copyrighted in the US but was copyrighted in Germany available.

* The US stopped extending the ICJ jurisdiction over the US.

There are people who think that the US *should* grant those courts jurisdiction.  Maybe you do.  But pointing out that the US doesn't grant them jurisdiction is not an argument that the US doesn't extradite nationals.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/emxnz5/britain_formally_requests_extradition_of_us/fdxwlo8/,duisThias,1578773662

Concentration camps were not just a ""Nazi thing"". USSR had Gulags. Even USA had concentration camps or camps where they concentrated citizens of Japanese origins. That is during WW2 events, I'm sure other countries have had and still have camps, looking at you China and NK.

Also your sentence is again kind of iffy, ""concentration camps started in 1939"" ... for which faction?

Nazi Germany? Because even that is wrong...

If you had done a quick Google you would see that the first camps went up long before 1939. 1933 was the year    Dachau camp was founded and mean't for undesirable people to be put into.

Yes sadly had to Google it but the idea sounded stupid in my mind. Why wait until the Polish campaign to establish death and work camps.

Apart from that it's all just single rooms in apartments.

I'd say that a normal apartment (so 2 bedrooms, living room, 1-2 bathrooms) in zurich will run somewhere from ~1600 to 2400 CHF (about the same in dollars).

Firstly, An apology, they have a contract to get around 9% of their annual electricity needs from Hydro power.  
I looked up DB's annual energy use and on average they are consuming 1.14GW of power at any moment. so let's account for the hydro contract and make it a neat 1GW.  
Taking representative figures from the UK's gridwatch service for worst-case scenarios, the worst moment scenario the UK saw last year in early evening during the heatwave saw 1.6% capacity solar power generation and 5% capacity wind generation. multiplying by Germany's installed capacity for wind and solar leaves a wind+solar generation of 3.2GW which is still comfortably 3x DB's entire energy consumption (ICE, IC &amp; EC are only a small proportion of their energy use).  
They also actually have a considerable amount of privately owned installed capacity so they don't have to bid higher when the wind/solar production is low.

After audits, it was found that 44 out of 55 existing savings banks do not meet the requirements. This situation directly threatened the finances of people who had taken out loans or loans from credit unions or entrusted their money. After 2014 controls, 13 credit unions collapsed and around 250,000 people died as a result of their bankruptcy. According to the Business Insider, the bank guarantee fund has so far paid them nearly PLN 4 billion 335 million.
1. [SREBNA-KACZYNSKI scandal](https://www.dw.com/en/kaczynski-tapes-reveal-murky-business-dealings-of-polands-powerful-pis-leader/a-47316459). The company in question, Srebrna, was founded in the mid-1990s by the conservative Porozumienie Centrum (PC) party, a forerunner to the PiS. The company is majority-owned by the Lech Kaczynski Institute, which was founded to commemorate the eponymous Polish president who died in a 2010 plane crash. Lech Kaczynski's twin brother Jaroslaw is on the institute's supervisory board. When Srebrna decided to erect two skyscrapers in central Warsaw, Jaroslaw Kaczynski signed off on the project. The Lech Kaczynski Institute was to move its headquarters to one of the towers and the remaining space was to be rented out. One-third of the annual revenue generated by the buildings would then go to the Lech Kaczynski Institute. A relative of Kaczynski's cousin, Austrian businessman Gerd Birgfellner, was tasked with bringing the €400 million ($460 million) project to fruition. To this end, Poland's state-run PKO Bank Polski apparently granted Birgfellner a €15.5 million loan. Without a permit, he then invested €1.5 million into the project, assuming Kaczynski would greenlight it as planned. But when Birgfellner asked to be reimbursed, Srebrna declined to foot the bill, as Jaroslaw Kaczynski had decided to stop the project.
1. [Morawiecki scandal](https://www.intellinews.com/index.php/poland-s-leading-newspaper-accuses-pm-morawiecki-of-shady-real-estate-deal-161583/). Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki used his personal ties with a key figure of the country’s Catholic Church and town hall officials in Wroclaw for a huge business gain that he kept away from the public’s eye, the leading Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza reported on May 20. The newspaper quotes documents to prove Morawiecki paid just PLN700,000 (€172,800 in 2002 prices) for 15 hectares of land, which the Wroclaw diocese had received from the Polish state in 1999. The land’s market price was assessed at PLN4mn at the time. After the PM bought the land, it was zoned to enable construction of an important throughway as well as commercial real estate such as offices. Morawiecki signed over the ownership of the land to his wife in 2013, the newspaper also claimed. The PM never mentioned the transaction or the ownership of the land in mandatory declarations of financial interests that public officials are obliged to submit and make public. The entire land the Morawieckis own is currently worth around PLN70mn, Gazeta Wyborcza claims on the basis of a survey of local land prices.
1. [PFN scandal](https://www.politico.eu/article/polska-fundacja-narodowa-polish-public-promotion-scheme-backfires/)  A lavishly funded Polish organization dedicated to improving the country's international image is trying to rescue its own reputation. The Polish National Foundation, founded in 2016 and financed to the tune of 400 million złoty (€93 million) from the country's leading state-run corporations, was supposed to combat the deluge of bad press about the country's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party. The foundation hasn't been willing to say much about its finances in Poland, but the online news portal Onet dug through financial statements made in Washington by a U.S. lobbying firm hired by the Polish organization. Onet reported that the White House Writers Group, a Washington PR firm, has been paid $5.5 million since 2017 to raise Poland's profile in the U.S. — a sum similar to the annual budget of the Polish Embassy in Washington. A YouTube site set up for the foundation had 13 subscribers as of Tuesday, with mostly fewer than 10 views per video. An Instagram account with stock images of Poland had 51 observers. And even some of those images were wrong. A picture of a sunset over the Polish capital turned out to be of Prague.

2374,"A carbon tax is not just ""a"" way to fight climate change, it is *the* only economically sound way. 

The market creates super complex worldwide trade chains to produce everything as cheaply as possible. It's essentially a big distributed optimization algorithm. But it doesn't take into account things like carbon (externalities). So if a product costs $3 to make but emits 100 tons of CO2 it will happily produce that instead of something that would cost $4 and not emit any CO2 at all.

The solution is to include that environmental cost in the cost. No government can possibly micromanage *everything everywhere* to find cleaner alternatives.

However the left (at least the American left, I haven't seen it as much in Europe) hates that solution (even though it should be perfect for them - ""make companies pay for what they pollute!""), because it implies that capitalism works and we can't be having none of that.

One good one is debt. Portugal has a very ""improvable"" credit rating. The last time they had great credit, they borrowed their way into a lot of debt. 

When you start running surpluses, you have options. Mainly, it's political, but in a time of surplus, you can do less borrowing, pay back some debt and hopefully improve your credit rating for a rainy day when you need to borrow again. 

Debt itself isn't a bad thing and surpluses aren't necessarily good. It's what you do with them. Using the surplus to give a tax cut to the rich isn't good. Spending it on certain programs might be less cost effective than improving borrowing for the future so it can be cheaper. 

Here's just a random article:

2503,"No, I am not. What I am saying is that higher prices will result in less people willing to pay those prices if they don't need to. And those people make up a significant portion of travellers, at least according to [this German airport survey](https://www.adv.aero/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Airport-Travel-Survey-2018_Brosch%C3%BCre.pdf) I found (page 6):

34.9 million holiday travellers (~40%)     
24.8 million travelling for private reasons (~28%)     
28.1 million work travellers (~32%) 

Holiday travellers do not need to fly and I am willing to bet that many who fly for private reasons do not need to fly either (maybe one in two?). That is why I am assuming that at least half of all travellers did not need to fly. My point is that the number of people who fly for private reasons and primarily holidays is massive, and increasing taxes on flying is a tool to cut down this number.

Of course this will affect people who need to fly as well.

Above, I excluded the number of people travelling for work. But if you take a look on page 7 you see what the destinations for those are: More than half of those who fly for work reasons fly from Germany to Germany or a neighbouring country (15.33m / 28.1m = 54%, only counting countries mentioned on page 7). Do those people need to fly? Depends on your definition of ""need to"", I guess. In addition many work flights are paid for by the corporation, so increasing prices will not even affect many work travellers directly.

2612,"I am sorry, but as long as pathetic excuses like the Deutsche Bahn exist, flying or driving will always be superior for long distances. 

I live in the German border region to Belgium and the Netherlands. Just over the last few weeks, I had to travel to Amsterdam multiple times and I had to take one Deutsche Bahn train to the Dutch border and back. This one train was ALWAYS delayed and when it finally arrived it was ALWAYS filthy and overcrowded. On top of that, this one train also costs almost a third of the whole travel costs. I can get from Maastricht (most southeastern part of the Netherlands) to Amsterdam (Northwest) for €27. 27 Euros to travel through all of he Netherlands, but the 20 km to the Dutch border already cost me €10 with DB. 

Additionally, I can also see what my father has to pay for a train ride in Germany that has pretty much the same distance as my ride to Amsterdam. He is paying €70 on a good day (with multiple delays) or around €100 on a bad day. Plus: His ride takes also almost 6 hours, while my ride to Amsterdam takes around 3,5 hours.

TLDR: Deutsche Bahn sucks. Too expensive, unreliable, and the coverage is terrible as well. There is no Train station closeby to my home, so I am forced to drive a car or pay €5 for a bus ride that doesn't even take me all the way to the train station and I still have to walk almost a kilometre.",North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany),/r/europe/comments/emwzwd/more_germans_are_swapping_planes_for_trains/fduc153/,Bronson94,1578730950

After those trades netted him massive profits, he built the bridge to show that he was not crazy.  It was known as the ""Colorful Bridge"" due to the red and gold lines.  During the Ottoman slavery, criminals, Bulgarian freedom fighters and revolutionary curries used to be hanged around the bridge.

The UK is a wildcard. The immigration issue will likely remain after Brexit, but if it can tie its market into the US, it'll have a somewhat more stable economy to weather the housing crisis and remain a seller's market for longer.

Norway is probably going to remain very stable, but likely very expensive to get in to.

Eastern Europe isn't experiencing the same levels of immigration, so the markets are growing more slowly. Problem is that their economies are tied to the rest of Europe so while the homelessness won't burden the welfare state as much, there will still be a recession.

If you want to travel cheap and minimize your ecological impact - take the bus. A bus would be like 3-4x more efficient than either train or plane, compared to 10-15% difference between the other two modes of transport. And many people on here mention subsidized air travel. Well fuck, in any EU country train travel gets huge subsidies - and in most places it's at least partially nationalized as well.

This looks just like another example where climate change memes triumph over practical sense. I mean I'm all for saving the planet and cutting emissions and all.

The PMF were entirely responsible for the defeat of ISIS in Iraq, and the US is killing them right now.

2950,"&gt;So what! It's still the same aircraft and therefore large savings are possible.

I seriously doubt retrofitting passenger airliners would be a simple process, the engines and fuel tanks are at the center of an aircraft's design and affect nearly every conceivable characteristic of it. Even your linked study is recommending massive alterations to the fuselage to the extent retrofitting is impractical. They seem to be considering new aircraft based on an existing model, which is very different from what you suggested.

They certainly have not considered how an aircraft's flight characteristics would be affected.

The Tu-155 was purpose built and being a 30 year old prototype, we have no useful metric to judge the engine's efficiencies by.

&gt;You drop them into the fuselage, ergo there are less seats ergo the tickets cost more. But it is possible.

You've already torpedoed any practical implementation of the idea with this statement. In a world where airline fleets are expanding rapidly and operating costs mean everything, the more economical option is forwarding improved designs that reduce the drawbacks in question, capitalize on potential advantages in design and create incentives for airlines to switch gradually.

This still means very little without economical and clean hydrogen production. You're advocating for pouring massive resources into a problem that means little in the grand scheme of things and complicates the issue; there is no useful rationale for retooling the global aviation fleet when comparable investment in electrification and replacing primary energy sources will net you much greater CO2 emission reduction.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/emwzwd/more_germans_are_swapping_planes_for_trains/fdsdydv/,_Whoop,1578700477

Except Spain, France and Italy, trains in Europe are relatively slow and majority of people will use plane. Most flight intra-europe last maximum 60-90 minutes from runway to runway. E.g. if I were to travel Zagreb-Vienna train ticket would cost about 100-120 euro and take about 7-8 hours, plane would cost about the same and I would be there in 2 hours while Flixbus would be the cheapest, at about 15-25 euros and it would take about 6 hours. And that from a country that doesn't have a lot of cheap flights like Germany does. Chain is strong as it's weakest link, and there aren't enough investments in high speed rail, taxes on such projects are too high and whenever new lines are to be built there is always some environmental, ecological, communal or other group that finds a way to slow or make project much more expensive.

&gt;  
&gt;The  British press has succeeded in its apparent project of hounding Meghan  Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, out of Britain. The part it perhaps  didn’t bargain for, however, is the loss of Prince Harry — a much loved  Royal and a key part of the family’s global brand — along with her.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a statement released this week, the couple said they want to  “carve out a progressive new role” within the royal family and will  “step back as ‘senior’ members, and work to become financially  independent.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The British press reacted with surprise at the “shock move abroad,”  described variously as “seismic,” “selfish,” “rogue” and “an atrocious  lapse of judgment.”  
&gt;  
&gt;If the media paid more attention to Britain’s communities of color,  perhaps it would find the announcement far less surprising. With a new  prime minister whose track record includes overtly racist statements,  some of which would make even Donald Trump blush, a Brexit project  linked to native nationalism and a desire to rid Britain of large  numbers of immigrants, and an ever thickening loom of imperial  nostalgia, many of us are also thinking about moving.  
&gt;  
&gt;From the very first headline about her being “(almost) straight outta  Compton” and having “exotic” DNA, the racist treatment of Meghan has  been impossible to ignore. Princess Michael of Kent wore an overtly  racist brooch in the duchess’s company. A BBC host compared the couple’s  newborn baby to a chimpanzee. Then there was the sublimely ludicrous  suggestion that Meghan’s avocado consumption is responsible for mass  murder, while her charity cookbook was portrayed as somehow helping  terrorists.  
&gt;  
&gt;Those who claim frequent attacks against the duchess have nothing to  do with her race have a hard time explaining these attempts to link her  with particularly racialized forms of crime — terrorism and gang  activity — as well as the fact that she has been most venomously  attacked for acts that attracted praise when other royals did them. Her  decision to guest-edit British Vogue, for example, was roundly condemned  by large parts of the British media, in stark contrast to Prince  Charles’s two-time guest editorship of Country Life magazine, Prince  Harry’s of a BBC program and Kate Middleton’s at Huffington Post, all of  which were quietly praised at the time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Her treatment has proved what many of us have always known: No matter  how beautiful you are, whom you marry, what palaces you occupy,  charities you support, how faithful you are, how much money you  accumulate or what good deeds you perform, in this society racism will  still follow you.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Britain’s rigid class society, there is still a deep correlation  between privilege and race. The relatively few people of color — and  even fewer if you count only those who have African heritage — who rise  to prominent success and prosperity in Britain are often told we should  be “grateful” or told to leave if we don’t like it here.  
&gt;  
&gt;The legacy of Britain’s history of empire — a global construct based  on a doctrine of white supremacy — its pioneering role in the slave  trade and ideologies of racism that enabled it, and policies of  recruiting people from the Caribbean and Africa into low-paid work and  then discriminating against them in education and housing, is with us  today: The scandal surrounding the wrongful deportation of black British  people in recent years is still reverberating.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meghan’s decision to join the family that is the symbolic heart of  the establishment responsible for this troubled history was perplexing  to many black British people, as we wondered whether she fully  appreciated the institution she had entered.  
&gt;  
&gt;Both she and Harry appear to have gained crystal clear vision as to  their reality. It’s no wonder the couple want to leave and — as the  coded statement that they want to raise their son Archie “with the space  to focus on the next chapter” seems to suggest — protect him from the  bile to which they’ve been exposed.  
&gt;  
&gt;The British press, having attacked the couple continuously, now  reacts with shock at this move. But the clues have been there for some  time for anyone willing to read them.  
&gt;  
&gt;There was the decision not to give Archie a title from birth —  something that is expected among royal children of this rank but which  Meghan and Harry appear to have chosen to avoid. Then there were the  rumors last spring that they might relocate to a country in southern  Africa.  
&gt;  
&gt;In recent months, the couple have begun bypassing official royal  channels and communicating with the press directly — most notably when  the Duchess said in a television documentary that she found adjusting to  royal life “hard,” and Harry revealed that the tragic experience of the  death of his mother, Princess Diana, made him want to “protect” his  wife and family.  
&gt;  
&gt;All were signs that the couple would not abide by royal business as  usual, to the extent that even announcing this decision to step down  from their roles as senior royals appears to have taken Buckingham  Palace by surprise.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am not at all surprised. This was the bitter shadow of their sunny  May 2018 wedding. How many of us suspected — hoping but doubting we were  wrong — that what would really initiate Meghan into her new role as a  Briton with African heritage would be her experience of British racism.  And ironically, by taking matters into their own hands, Harry and  Meghan’s act of leaving — two fingers up at the racism of the British  establishment — might be the most meaningful act of royal leadership I’m  ever likely to see.",,/r/europe/comments/emxryq/opinion_black_britons_know_why_meghan_markle/fds1hoo/,yolo4everlmi,1578692909

3089,"To be historically correct Nazi eugenic ideas where off the wall at different times so no one really knows what the idea was in the end - it changed and everyone has their own theories like you.

'Magically' Finnish and Japanese 'rank' rose once they supported their war effort.

For the Baltic the idea was from no extermination to 25% to 50% to 75% to 100%. Also in different times and the person writing it changed. Also different Baltic regions had different weight, some were more German influenced as Latvia, Estonia and some less like Lithuania, who used to have their own empire with Poland at the time.

Also the idea what extermination meant was different, it is still not known even for most Jews or unwanted races if they wanted to kill, work or simply deport the population outisde their living space.

Btw, just as a sidefact the guy who basically designed or ""put it in written form"" for the state of Nazis as were the racial theories, lebensraum and other similar stuff was Alfred Rosenberg. By roots born to a Estonian/Latvian and Baltic German/French parents, guy who at one time lead the Nazi Party pre-war when Hitler was jailed and during was was the head of the occupied Eastern Europe areas.

Another person of influence near Hitler was Goebbels who also showed ""mercy"" on some of the Eastern Europeans. You can add Himmler to that stock as he allowed recruits due to necessity from those areas.

So depends on the person, timeframe and need of that specific time you can most certainly say that there was no real plan how to carry out or what to do with ""lesser people"".

Beside the fact it's often not talked about how Baltics, or Estonians, at least had a plan to remain neutral for most of the war. As that failed and were drawn into the war they started  playing the ""sides"" game. Some went into hiding to avoid the draft. Some joined Germans, some Russians, some Finns, some fought as partisans in Estonia against both Soviets and Germans.

At 1943-44 at the time the news was already spreading that Germans are slowly losing ground and it was fairly obvious from the fact that the line stalled and a frontline was being established while local forces were retreating back to German main lands. So the first Estonian republic tried to actually take use of that power vacuum and a desperate attempt at grabbing back power began. News was sent out that a re-independence was established and needed support, what guns were left were grabbed by locals, a new government was called and for I think, 3 days the seat of parliament, Estonian flag was hoisted on top of the tower.

The frantic plan was to hold out a defense near the Blue mountains with what troops were left and hope that either politically or practically something happens and the Soviets would redirect forces seeing as that front won't budge.

Well obviously we know what happened in the end, USSR troops reached Estonian territory and simply reestablished themselves and hoisted the red flag instead of ours again.

Point being, even during the war, it can be argued there was enough resistance and a plan to avoid being under German or Soviet control.

As for the forshadowing ""Germans would of killed everyone"" arguably the Russians did the same. The language was slowly faced out, all the resistance elements of the population were either killed or deported. National symbols were banned. Basically russification.

So again you could say USSR half succeeded in wiping out the nation anyway as at that time with the influx of new people made 33% of the country non-native when it managed to get re-independent.

Basically lebensraum for USSR citizens in general and culturally. Other Finnic and Baltic populations that were left inside the modern Russian territory attest to what happened, they mostly forgot their language and became russified. Now having said that, that is basically a ""normal thing"" for certain populations to assimilate into a bigger culture sphere but the difference was Soviets and Germans did it with force.

So I would again argue your points of ""80%"" and the idea that being assimilated by Germans or Soviets with the end goal of losing ones culture, language and population integrity be any different considering the end result - none of this really mattered.

And just on this point, USSR lasted for 70 years, we have no idea how long a superstate under Germany would of lasted and we can't wilfully predict what plans were put in action. I mean even the Molotov pact to divide countries did not go as on paper with Lithuania going to USSR instead of Germany - how on earth can we be certain in population control plans? As I said even the plans of paper changed enough, never mind something actual.

Historical narrative is the same for everyone country. The way we view from each side is different and can be different. Facts like troop numbers, battles etc will not change.

You yourself are engaing in this ""views of side"" by adding your own subjective views with ""80%"" , talking about some guys prediction that has no actual bearing on what really happened  so I feel your comment is a little misguided in itself.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/emuosm/putins_latest_obsession_a_new_world_war_ii/fds3fr5/,Dicios,1578693741

For all their talk of wiping Israel off the map, Iran could achieve that with less hassle by building up long range missiles without nuclear weapons, and a giant air force to deliver it. If all they are concerned with is a suicidal race to wipe out Israel, they can do that. 

The more likely scenario is that Iran wants them, because once you have them, certain things are harder to do. It's much harder to overthrow a government when they are the only ones who know for sure where their missiles are, and when that government is paying the soldiers guarding those missiles from being stolen and sold. 

The threat of the nuclear weapon is almost worth more than the bomb itself. If you use the nuke, you're all but guaranteed to be attacked back. No superpower is going to allow any opponent to deploy a nuclear weapon...but being able to threaten superpowers or their allies once you've got the weapon? Then you're way better off.

It taxes five additional percentage points on anyone's annual income that exceeds 703,000 crowns. The Liberals have pushed for removing the värnskatt for a long period of time. The reform is expected to cost the state 6.1 billion crowns each year.

3129,"&gt;I have no idea what got you banned. I'm saying you think it was because you were directly being a wierdo to me. 

I gave you a nickname in jest and then I mysteriously get banned subsequently after, I know you're enjoying it, but let's not pretend you weren't responsible. 

&gt;You immediately suspected me because you know you were being a targeting obsessive knob.

Gaslighting.

&gt;At least you acknowledge you were, which is something I suppose, but I just saw you were banned and thought it was funny.

Yeah, because you were the one that did it. 

&gt;And it certainly is funny.

I guess it's also funny you're triggered enough to report me. Every cloud has a silver lining and all that. 

&gt;Im calling you possessive because you utterly cannot comprehend that half of Scots dislike the Union and it is the behaviour of people like you that make us feel that way.

More gaslighting behaviour, I'm quite aware of the inequities of the Union, but the difference between me and you and the majority of SNP members is that breaking the country up isn't the best solution, or the best solution out of a list of bad options. 

&gt;When told you are jumping into something that's not about you, you start claiming it isenitely about you, getting raging about a place you don't live because you feel your national identity entitles you to it, ironically something that should go against everything else you stand for. It isn't collaborative of you fucking scream, shout and name call when millions obviously aren't happy about it. 

Again, your gaslighting aside for a moment, I have repeatedly told you of my Scottish heritage and family who live in Scotland, so it very much does affect me. What's bizzare is your complete lack of understanding of this dynamic which will be disrupted by Scottish independence and the break up of the socio-political order which has been around for 300 years. So you're right, it's not about me, or you, it's about everyone on this island. 

&gt;We do t inhabit the same political environment. You need to start listening and stop being wilfully ignorant. Scotland isn't England, and Scotland isn't just an extension of UK politics. It is very, very different. I keep trying to say this but you don't care because it offends your national identity. 

You can wish as much as you want that we don't, but unfortunately you do inhabit the same political environment as I do and Scottish politics does not exist in a vacuum seperate from the rest of the UK, decisions made by the nationalists have implications everywhere else on this island and you and your SNP mates want to unpack a political economic and social relationship which has been existing for the past 300 years and you don't expect any input from England or the UK political establishment? Are you for real?

&gt;And imagine quoting Orwell on Nationalism to defend you nationalism. Je specifically takes about how 'patriotism' is used as a basis for fascism. You've honestly lost it. 

Nah, you've lost it, you're comparing me to a fuckin' Brexiteer just because my patriotism isn't in line with your Scottish nationalism. Maybe one day you'll get your head out of your ass and realise alot of people on these islands aren't as two dimensional you are trying to characterise them as. 

&gt;Seriously, stop looking at me as some existential enemy, and see me as someone probably quite politically similar to you who just wants a different method for where I live. Where you live is up to you.

You're starkly different in one obvious way which conflicts with one of my fundamental beliefs, if you think I'm bad, just wait until independence really happens, then you get to see what bitter division really looks and feels like, hope it was worth it 👍",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/emr2uh/boris_johnson_might_break_up_the_uk_thats_a_good/fdrjzuf/,DrPepperThanks,1578685620

3134,"yes, but depending on your economical state loans can be more or less beneficial. If you are Greece you only get horrendous ones, but if you are someone like Germany you will get better ones, which then can mean that you could trade worse loans against more affordable loans which then in return frees up spendable budget. You should also not forget that the most important part about a government is its role in the society. They are there to sustain and improve the infrastructure and the social system. If you let that deteriorate just because you want to pay back loans that's probably not the best idea since your GDP is also dependent on your infrastructure, school system and so on (varying on the type of businesses you have). So running a surplus is nice and all, but you should also be looking to make it sustainable. Otherwise you do something that we call in German: ""Kaputt gespart"" which means saving money until its broken.

I am from Germany and we have the problem right now that, although we have the black 0 which means no new loans, we should be investing more into our infrastructure. Bridges crumble without being repaired and don't even get me started on the internet debacle (that seems to at least improve right now). Don't get me wrong, it's not nightmarishly bad right now, but it is still a bit to much already and we are not even running on the military costs that Trump is asking for.

These many many cases are the two biased articles, which can anybody wrote without confirmation of sources? Pathetic. 

&gt; They did.  But Poland is making it practically impossible to win. 

Rrright. So they lost the case at court. Because - most probably - they couldn't prove their claims to that property. And that's because thousands of archives were burned and lost during the war. Hmm... this war again. Could you remind me, who was responsible for that war, please?

&gt; Returning property you took is not ""reparations.""  It's basic fairness. 

The basic fairness is coming to the court and acknowledging its verdicts. Not whining like a wounded dog when you lost ""boohoo I've lost so it must be rigged, we need extra special reparations so I can get what I want anyway""

Every single Pole or his descendant has to go exactly the same way. Like I said, we're not Israel and nobody gets priviledged treatment here.

&gt; Poland kicking victims  

You mean, we're kicking our citizens? Well, hard to deny that the communist goverment imposed on us after the war was a tyrrany which didn't care too much about our citizens.

Fortunatelly we somehow managed to overthrow them ca 30 years ago. And only after that any possibility of reclaiming lost properties arised. And they are happening. So that not everyone wins his cases? Well, that's sad - maybe if Germans didn't invade Poland they wouldn't lost their properties today, hmm?

And if communists rule until today, nobody would see a single penny or a single return of property. Never ever. You should be grateful to current, democratic Poland for the chance it provides.

&gt; Poland is even took property from LIVING victims 

Yeah, after the war and with all the disorder which came after it it was certainly possible.  Again, we didn't ask for that. 

&gt; Nope.  Normal procedure it to give that property to heirs. 

And they are given - if they can only PROVE it. If they can't they won't get it, such is the law. The applicant have to PROVE their claims, not the other way. 

And if he can't they lose the case. You don't expect we should give virtually **anyone** properties or reparations only because he said so without any legal proofs for this, do you?

&gt; So, the system is rigged.  Poland needs to give the properties back instead of making an excuse after excuse. 

The system is fair and Poland is giving the properties back (or reparations for them if it's somehow impossible) for all of those who can prove their ownership.

If you can't prove it, you won't get it. But it's not Poland's fault and nobody here won't compensate you for this.",,/r/europe/comments/ekkk6g/polish_president_to_skip_auschwitz_anniversary_in/fdrkwwh/,dwaemu,1578685956

3254,"&gt;The President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, accepts the decision of the Spanish Supreme Court and ceases to recognise Oriol Junqueras as an MEP. The European Parliament has withdrawn its recognition of ERC's leader Oriol Junqueras as an MEP after the Supreme Court ruled that he lost his immunity as an MEP after he was sentenced to 13 years in prison and debarment because of the independence push.

&gt;Oriol Junqueras will no longer be considered a Member of the European Parliament starting January 3rd when the Spanish Central Electoral Board agreed that the leader of ERC cannot be a Member of the European Parliament because he was sentenced ""by a final judgement to imprisonment"".

&gt;The Supreme Court agreed on Thursday to leave Junqueras in prison, sentenced to 13 years in prison for sedition and embezzlement, considering that even though he acquired the status of MEP last June, his final sentence disqualifies him as such and is not protected by parliamentary immunity.

Then there's the geography.  Sweden has around 4000 bridges and 216 tunnels on 12000km of railway. Compare that to Norways 2760 bridges and 696 tunnels on 4000km of railway and you realize the reason for the lack of fast trains...

3326,"The Russian leader feels the European narrative of the war is shifting in ways that make the Soviet Union a villain.

The 75th anniversary of the end of World War II was the only forthcoming event Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned in his New Year’s address to the nation. Creating an alternative to the dominant Western narrative about that war is key to Putin’s way of securing Russia’s place in the world.


Putin has appeared lately to be obsessed with World War II, discoursing about it at every opportunity — during an informal session with other post-Soviet leaders, at his big end-of-year press conference, in a meeting with Russian tycoons, at the Defense Ministry in the presence of top generals. He’s talked time and again about delving into archival documents; he’s mentioned working on a scholarly article about the war. Even for a leader who has made the Soviet Union’s victory over the Nazis (seen by many as a triumph over a rotten Europe) a cornerstone of the new Russian national identity, Putin’s evident emotional involvement and the sheer time investment are unusual.


That’s because Putin, his foreign policy advisers and his propagandists see the dominant narrative of the war shifting against Russia.


Throughout the Cold War’s worst years, the victorious alliance of the Soviet Union, the U.S., the U.K. and France was a reminder that cooperation was possible. There is, however, a tendency to dump that baggage now and to treat Russia as a villain without any qualifications. Late last year, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked to recall when he’d changed his mind. His response:


&gt; What I’ve really changed my mind on was whether it is possible to reset with Russia. I really thought, as I think many foreign secretaries and prime ministers have thought before, that we could start again with Russia. That it’s a great country we fought with against fascism. It was very, very disappointing that I was wrong.

The Kremlin is extremely sensitive to such signals — not just for domestic propaganda reasons, but because Russia’s global power is still based on some important spoils of World War II. As one of the nations that vanquished Hitler, the Soviet Union didn’t just win control over Eastern Europe, it received a place atop the postwar global order and an all-important permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. If the Soviet Union is primarily seen as Hitler’s ally at the outset of the war — which of course it was — rather than a Hitler conqueror at its conclusion, if Russia has never really been on the right side of history, it has no claim to moral authority and to a role as a global arbiter. To Putin, that role is, in a way, as important as Russia’s nuclear shield. The ability to say authoritatively what’s right and what’s wrong is, after all, a major part of what makes the U.S. a global superpower.

Kremlin-linked historians and propagandists see the shifting narrative as the result of Eastern Europe’s increased role in the continent as a whole. Since, of all European nations, Poland and the Baltic states are the most concerned with the policy and politics of memory, their loud voices have drawn the European political elite’s attention away from the victory and toward the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939, in which Nazi Germany and Josef Stalin’s USSR divided up spheres of influence in Europe. One result of this was a European Parliament resolution last year that equates the Soviet regime with the Nazi one in terms of the damage done to Europe, a document that has been a strong irritant to the Russian leadership and to Putin personally.

This year’s first issue of Russia in Global Politics, a foreign-policy journal with strong Kremlin links that often provides insights into the Putin administration’s geopolitical thinking, contains the transcript of a fascinating debate among prominent Russian historians on how Russia might try to shape the World War II narrative in a more politically advantageous direction. The debate casts Israel as Russia’s only ally in fighting the turning tide, and Poland as its main adversary.

The logic behind this is that Israel will never agree with the propaganda narratives of the nationalist governments in Poland and the Baltics, which aim to reject all blame for locals’ cooperation with the Nazis during the Holocaust. Indeed, as the Polish government has doubled down on its own nationalist memory policy — which casts Poland as an innocent victim of both Russian and German aggression — it has clashed repeatedly with Israel and the global Jewish community.

The Poles have also had their difficulties with the European Union: They’ve tried to push through a reform of their judiciary that is seen in Brussels as an attack on the rule of law, and they’ve torpedoed various common policies in areas such as immigration and climate protection. 
So here’s the recipe for the Russian memory counteroffensive as formulated during the discussion by Moscow State University historian Fyodor Gaida:

&gt; So then our main scapegoat is Poland. If we and the European bureaucrats need a common enemy, I guess Poland will be the first candidate. Poland’s role should get the most attention, which is what’s happening today. Our main ally is, yes, Israel. I agree completely, this topic must be developed: Jews in the Red Army and so on.
Gaida also proposes that Russia should stress that all former Soviet republics contributed to the victory, rather than that Russia led the effort. 

So far, Putin has played all these cards. He has repeatedly recalled Poland’s land-grab in Czechoslovakia after France and Britain agreed to that country’s carve-up in Munich in 1938. During the meeting with the generals, he recalled how a Polish ambassador to the Third Reich told Hitler he’d be commemorated with a statue in Warsaw if he managed to dispatch the Jews to Africa, as he once planned. “A bastard, an anti-Semitic pig, I have no other way to say it,” Putin raged. 

Never mind that the ambassador in question, Josef Lipski, actually helped Jews fleeing Germany before the war get into Poland, as Polish Jewish community leaders pointed out. On Jan. 23, Putin will give an address at a ceremony in Israel commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Red Army’s liberation of Auschwitz, but Polish President Andrzej Duda has refused to go because he hasn’t been given a chance to speak. 

As for the former Soviet republics’ role in the victory, Putin made it the focus of his meetings with ex-Soviet leaders last month, telling them, “For all of us — I’d like to stress that and I know you agree — for all of us this is a special anniversary, because our ancestors, our fathers, our grandfathers have placed so much on the altar of our then-common Fatherland.”

Over the next few months, we should expect the Russian memory counterattack to develop in new directions. During the historians’ debate, Alexander Lomanov from the International Economics and Foreign Relations Institute in Moscow proposed working more closely with China, which, he said, would appreciate more attention to its role in defeating Japan and thus allowing the Soviet Union to spare its forces for the anti-Hitler front. In return, he said, China would be happy to promote the idea that the Soviets were the main force behind the victory in Europe:

&gt; The Chinese narrative has retained many of the familiar positive images of the “great Soviet Union” and “mighty Red Army,” which made the decisive contribution into crushing fascism. Given the strict control over historical memory in China, any “spontaneous” criticism of the Soviet Union role in World War II is impossible. The narrative is created from above and controlled by the political elite.

Much of Putin’s foreign-policy activity this year will be directed toward trying to rebuild a more Russia-centric concept of the victory over the Nazis. This is territory where Putin isn’t prepared to give ground, and given the enormous complexity of the historical material as well as the cross-currents of Israeli, U.S. and European memory politics, he can put up quite a diplomatic and propaganda fight. 

It's precisely these complexities, though, that make any kind of government involvement in shaping the memory of World War II so abhorrent. As politicians cherry-pick the blood-soaked record for political purposes, truth is the biggest loser. As Alexey I. Miller of the European University in St. Petersburg put it during the historians’ discussion, “The idea that we are returning to historical memory to overcome political differences and enmity has been superseded by the understanding of memory as one more area where political goals are being sought.” Russia, given its size and the dizzying extremes of its World War II record, shouldn’t get involved in this. It should take pains to recognize and atone for its crimes even as it celebrates its heroic past. Even if narrative wars are a reality, refusing to fight them is the strongest possible position.",Lake Bled connoisseur,/r/europe/comments/emuosm/putins_latest_obsession_a_new_world_war_ii/fdr5sv9/,MelodicBerries,1578679838

So they can collectively drive up prices, even if many apartments are completely empty for over a year, holding valuable living spaces in cities hostage.

Just as healthcare can‘t be run completely private, neither can housing.

A prime example how to do it well is Vienna, it has tons of low cost apartments and even students can afford their own apartments.
The city owns large chunks of the properties in the city and does a lot of construction itself, so the city can set the price baseline, which heavily pushes down property prices and keeps them affordable for the average person.

It might be just an artifact or incomplete information. But I personally find it curious about this trajectory because I would expect the debris to be ahead of the likely missile impact point (where the transponder stopped working). There is probably a good justification, did they lose a wing and one engine kept working?

&gt;Not true at all. Second world war became inevitable due to Western concessions to nazis, as well as Britain's and France's refusal to enter into an anti-nazi coalition with Soviet Union, long before ww2 officially broke out.

To make it more simply for you, I'll reiterate:

- Both Soviets and Western powers are aware of Hitler's expansionist goals in the East (Lebensraum).
- Britain and France sacrifice Czechoslovakia in order to appease Germany.
- Before the beginning of the ww2, Soviet Union offers to Britain and France the creation of an anti-nazi coalition, in order to defeat Germany.
- Britain and France refuse. Fearing that their intent is to direct Germany towards East, by giving concessions and trying to remain neutral, Soviet Union instead allies temporarily with Germany, to gain time and prepare for the eventual war.",All power to the Soviets!,/r/europe/comments/emfjqx/estonian_leader_sends_back_the_crimean_wine_sent/fdqei8i/,RusThrowAway111,1578664579

3504,"You're conflating two things here: the grammatical tradition and a discussion on how to define noun classes in IE with 2-3 noun classes.

It's not strictly Latin because it's also in Greek grammars but the point is that this tradition isn't very scientific and it's extremely idiosyncratic. You have to remember that in ""the West"" aka Christendom, there existed *only* Greek and Latin grammars up until the 16th/17th C. and even up into the 20th C. people tried (and try; a la the ""debate"" over hanging prepositions in English) exceedingly hard to force non-Latin/Greek languages into those categories/forms. It's somewhere between sad and amusing how hard they tried, for example, to explain Slavic aspect using Latin and Greek terminology.

We **cannot**, in fact, safely assume anything about past structures based on current form or distribution. The only thing that really develops consistently in language is phonology. The strong correlation between a sub-type, doesn't mean the categories are actually one and the same. That the languages many of us are familiar with have this connection is because these languages are all related and have the same source: proto-Indo-European where there was strong but not absolute correlation. These languages have also been in constant contact; it's very well established that certain features (sounds, grammatical concepts, etc.) that are otherwise rare and non ""natural"" or intuitive can be, on a local level, very common; so called areal features.

Furthermore, the idea that noun class started as a marker of natural gender and shifted en masse to all nouns requires a hell of a lot more evidence &amp; support than the other way around. Why would natural gender markers be applied to things without a natural gender? However, words for things with natural gender (man, woman, child, etc.) are, well, words and nouns, specifically, so if noun classes exist, then they'll belong to one. A far more stable thesis would be that once the correlation was consciously established (in fact, most language operates below a speaker's consciousness), people might start forcing things with natural genders to shift their grammatical gender to match. It's entirely arbitrary in some systems like German (unlike Polish or Russian, where it's clearly phonologically determined) so you get words like Nutella where people will argue it belongs to any of the three.

This kind of metonymy/overlap is similar to those graphs that correlate the amount of Nicolas Cage movies in a year with pool drownings; the correlation is real! But it's not especially meaningful. One could just as well name the der/den/dem/des class in German the ""river category"" because most rivers of the world are in that class. There are in fact languages which do separate noun classes by meaning, but they're rather the minority  &amp; this likely wasn't the case for IE &amp; certainly isn't the case for Polish or Russian.",,/r/europe/comments/emd3v2/countries_gender_pronouns_in_polish/fdqent1/,dzialamdzielo,1578664698

3593,"Well grats on missing the point entirely and proving my point at the same time. 

Allow me to rephrase:

&gt; Many Europeans live close to border regions with other countries where the native language is different and where cross border business and community is not unusual.
Britain doesn’t border any other country where English isn’t the first language.

Here we see the typical mindset of an Englishman. Making excuses of why he shouldn't learn a second language and glossing over the language diversity in his own fuckin country. Yes, I said ""shouldn't"". Not ""won't"" or ""hasn't"". Whenever the topic of second languages comes up with English people they are the first to let you know why they SHOULDN'T. They have no interest and don't want to have any interest in such matters. That's the typical English mindset it seems. 

&gt; Those languages are, for all intents and purposes, only spoken in Britain and are spoken by very few people (Welsh is a bit of an exception). Much more importantly, the first language for nearly everyone in the UK is English (even in the rare cases where it is not, those individuals speak English fluently). That is why the vast majority of Brits don’t see any benefit to learning one of the other indigenous languages of these isles.
What exactly is the point of language diversity? What does it offer? Communication is demonstrably better when everyone can perfectly understand each other. Language diversity simply introduces inefficiencies. It’s benefits are purely aesthetic and academic.

Here is the typical Englishman further making excuses and putting further emphasis on why regional and minority languages (that hold legal status) in his own country don't matter thus letting you know that if the languages in his own country don't matter unless they are English that you shouldn't expect the typical Englishman to bother about languages such as French or German because it's across the sea don't ya know! God forbid the Japanese start learning English. That's not allowed. They don't border any English speaking country. They're not even allowed to learn Chinese!

*Since no one in Britain speaks any other language other than English (even the minority and regional languages are totally a show those people's first language is still English!!!) well then no one should even bother learning anything else.*

That's how you sound. 

&gt; Diversity is not inherently a good thing, you’ve been brainwashed if you think it is.

You think people are being reprimanded in other countries if they don't learn a second language? It's just what people do when they live on a planet where there's more than 1 language. And for your information most languages are only spoken in singular countries but that doesn't stop people from learning them.

Trump considers the EU a conspiracy against the US and actively tries to undermine the union. Trump have imposed tariffs and threatens sanctions against European allies. Airbus alone lost a 20 billion dollar deal with Iran thanks to Trump.  
  
That's not how you strengthen alliances.  
  
And the US gets something in return for their involvement in Europe. As an example, Norway have a radar station right next to the Russian border. That's not there for Norways sake.

Basing military equipment, manpower and/or infrastructure in or on civilian object makes those civilian objects legal military target.

However, protecting civilian centers like major cities is a normal step. If you want short range air defense for your seat of government you are forced to deploy it in the city if a city is as large as Seoul.

So it's perhaps not a dirty trick in the context of South Korea since it's probably not a ""human shield"" setups, but it most certainly makes those buildings target.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/emgmtu/video_apparently_showing_flight_ps752_missile/fdpql0f/,Digital_Eide,1578636760

**Chlorinated chicken:**  Fuck no!

Does it harm the body? No. In the EU do we need to do such a thing? No. Simply by having faster transit with better standards solves this problem. I don't know any European countries even in the eastern bloc that chlorinates chicken.

**GMO foods:** Over pesticides? According to science, of course.. over organic? No way. 

Anti-GMO stims from Greenpeace during the TTIP negotations. Hundreds of scientist including over 100+ Nobel laureates all said that Greenpeace was wrong and in the majority of uses with food, it poses absolutely no harm to humans short term or long term. But in Europe in particular its a major issue even though with CETA we're about to get flooded with GMO products 

**Pesticide tainted food:** It depends, but mostly this is the worst even over chlorinated chicken. 

Unlike GMOs, pesticides cause extreme issues to far more of the wildlife, the rivers, the soil. GMO is engineered to fight off certain diseases through chemistry whereas pesticides is spreading clouds of highly toxic mist that destroys rivers and soil across the world. GMOs are growing the fastest in Asia, especially East Asia. But in Europe, GMO is still somehow seen as the most evil of them all even though EU companies are some of the top makers of GMO seeds..

3941,"&gt;Yes, after the founding of the EU in 1945

The European coal and steel community (ECSC), was established in 1951. The 6 founding members are The Netherlands, Italy, France, Belgium, Luxembourg and West Germany.

After WW2, Europa said ""no more"". The ECSC was established to integrate the economies of the first 6 members. They needed to be reliant on each other and interdependent. This was to make it very hard to go to war with one another, as that would damage your own economy as well. The second world war was a bloody and horrendous part of European history. We needed to promote peace. So the integration process continued and has been very successful. The EU is very peaceful.

The Chinese.. 

The fucking Chinese.. 

Last time I went there was a huge number of Chinese tourist. It was the usual, everyone giving them the evil eye and them acting like they were in a theme park and everyone around them, the buildings, everything was for their amusement to do with as they wish. 

When I was going to St. Vitus, we decided to eat real fast so we did. There was a rather large Chinese tourist group that entered right after we entered, taking up 4 tables or so (about 14 people). Very very long story short (This lasted nearly 2 hours), they ended up getting absolutely irate that they didnt have a dedicated server, that we were getting service before them. This waiter had to be 18 or so, his eyes started to water. We decided to stick around a bit just in case things went even further south (the entire time up to this point they were having the waiters fill up their glasses even if they werent empty, were snapping their fingers, talking VERY loud) and anyways a couple sitting at a local table that had been recording the things when they started to get bad decided to speak to the owner that was there.. he was already aware of the situation as he came to our table to appologise. Anyways he decided to bill them as a hint that they need to get the fuck out. Then the fun part starting to come (I'm sure their bill was extremely expensive, it was a rather posh place). The bill didnt list every single item but rather a summary so this entire large group of people wanted to know exactly what they were being billed for (acting like they were trying to scam them) so they go through the entire fucking list for each table (20 minutes later, at this time two more staff showed up) and then they start to say ""we never were served X or X!"" At this point there are other tourist from Europe / US talking to eachother not hiding their disdain and the owner is on the phone with whoever off to the corner.. finally he walks up to the table and ask them to leave. Apparently they travel agency was sent the bill. The chances of ANY of that being paid is VERY unlikely. 

Anyways there were about 3 other Chinese tourist incidents that ruined an otherwise glorious trip to Prague. I think we were unlucky, I dont hear many friends have such a Chinese horror story when they go there but hopefully this spring I'll go back and hopefully there are far fewer Chinese. 

I think Europe should be like rednecks in the US, there was a Chinese family that had rented a nice Mercedes SUV.. probably 160k $ and then there was this redneck family (we were leaving a mountain peak after sunset) and anyways the Chinese family was causing a major traffic jam for a road that took nearly 30 minutes  just to get off the mountains so the redneck instead of beeping decided to get out of his truck, talking like he had special needs real loud and slow and saying ""I dont know if you understand what I'm saying but these lovely folks are trying to go home so can you kindly BACK THE FUCK UP!"" I think the driver was a doctor, he just reminded me of one. It was hilarious but he IMMEDIATELY did as the redneck said and when he apologised, he spoke perfect English so he got it all.

This may well be the case and may be two more reasons why British expats in France and in Germany differ. I would not see it as a contradiction to what I wrote, but as a complementing remark.

That said, when learning the language properly, French is only marginally easier than German. In fact that main difference is that at the beginning you make faster progress in French, but this evens out at a later stage. But still, this difference in learning curves may contribute to a higher motivation of UK expats in France.

Independent of this, the original question was about the benefits of learning a foreign language beyond social benefits. And these are independent of whether you learn French or German.",Berlin,/r/europe/comments/emfzbt/britons_by_far_the_worst_in_europe_at_foreign/fdpkdo4/,nibbler666,1578631031

* Said aircraft departed Tehran shortly after the revolutionary guard launched a salvo of missiles at military airports in Iraq in retaliation for the assassination of their general.  

Plainly, the Iranian government should have suspended civilian air travel if they knew they were going to initiate a military action and  fire missiles at another sovereignty that could result in retaliation. If you look at recent incidents between Pakistan and India, it's the norm to shut-down civilian air travel. Tehran is nowhere near the Iraq border or the Persian Gulf. The idea that something with the radar signature of a 737 penetrated Iranian airspace to Tehran without notice is beyond silly. What's especially damning is that Iran has been using the shoot-down of Iran Air-655 by the USS Vincennes in 1988 for propaganda purposes for almost 30 years now. Shoe is on the Iranian foot now. Think the Iranians are going to be hot to admit they accidentally shot down this airplane? That would basically be admitting the Americans didn't intentionally shoot-down IA-655 in 1988.

4047,"&gt;  Of course they are. But it's still a sensible investment, they generate more than enough electricity over their lifetime to recoup the initial cost.

... which is not true. Not without a lot of caveats. I mean, ""oh it's viable because it's stairwell"". Great, you just covered 2% of building's energy consumption with PV panels. Good for you! What about 98%? Plus... yeah it kind of is uncommon design. Generally architects have been trying to 'hide' stairwells and bathrooms so they don't take as much valuable sun-lit front. Having as much exposed is extremely rare nowadays (by which I mean last 2 decades unless architect was a monkey).

&gt;Of course this applies to Germany and other countries with high or semi-high consumer electricity prices. In Poland it is hard to beat the super cheap coal electricity on price if the government doesn't do anything about it.

Actually, kinda opposite: they are doing a lot about it. Consumer electricity prices are frozen specifically because coal is anything but cheap. Regardless... you're kind of getting it backwards in general: Germany currently has by far highest consumer electricity prices, which in turn makes PV installation that would be irrational anywhere else viable there. Vast majority of EU is actually much closer to where Poland is (and likely Poland will be one of the higher ones this year).

As for what my point is... Well, the initial point I was responding to was basically saying ""PV panels are cheap and work great with BEVs!"". To which my counterpoint was: no, they're not when people don't live in stand-alone homes that have both real estate to mount enough PVs and potentially battery-based storage system, and parking facilities to actually charge cars from. With a lot of European countries having 60-65% of population living in such flats, idea that we can rely on end-user decentralized PV panels is simply moronic. There's literally no way in hell to charge enough BEVs for apartment building from PV panels mounted on it even if we go absurd and slap it on every available surface.

Another point I'm making is PV panels are simply terrible idea when you have no storage solution or at least comprehensive grid buy back system with industry tailored to utilizing it.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/elxpml/polands_started_to_use_green_license_plates_for/fdp6wms/,Fresherty,1578621409

4146,"Yes, a lot of people object to that conclusion based on that data, yet trust nations and their politicians, which often downright lie and fabricate evidence and “expert opinions” (remember the old Italian shoot down and Frank Taylor). I never said such methods were fool proof. But in a world where propaganda is king (sadly our world) hobbyists and experts speaking unofficially under some nicknames seem to be the most objective, even if they don’t have all the data. Sure, experts analyzing data is better, but here we won’t have that as Iran stole the black boxes, which per conventions belong to Ukraine...

As for the things you mention:

A bomb near the cockpit might do the trick, however it is also the most common propaganda scam used by governments. Like the Italian incident I mentioned. Or Poland’s Smolensk crash and that weird alternative theory supported by the current populist government, or rather some people in it, the whole government does not dare. That being said such a bomb would have to be either planted in Tehran or if earlier totally ignored by local staff from safety peeps to cleaning staff. Possible, but not likely. And the way more probable option of placing it locally incriminates Iran even more, as it points to not accidental...

Disabling the transponder and than what? What would cause the crash shown on video after disabling the transponder? 9/11 was intentional. Here an intentional nose dive does NOT work, as the footage available shows some part of the plane on fire. 

Yeah, possible, technically. Probable? Yeah, nope. I mean this was commented as the biggest coincidence in the history of the world or at least air travel if it was not an accidental shootdowns and that still is possible.

However we all know most governments did NOT acknowledge their accidental shootdowns, even presented with evidence and there sure is no chance Iran ever will. With them illegally keeping the black boxes, the best we will have is Western (and other if anyone cares) analysis based on not much more data than what hobbyists see.

4252,"&gt;Poland's military expenditure is growing. Just from 2018 to 2019 it grew by 2.4 billion dollars.

That's good, but not really huge, especially if you have that much modernization to do and you buy from foreign countries. And even mostly home made project, like their new IFV and their self-propelled artillery are not cheap.

This deal would as expensive, probably way more expensive than their F35 deal. This can go everywhere from 5 billion to 15 billion $. 

About 25% of the polish Budget goes to equipment annually.

Buying 800 of the most expensive tanks in the World is very expensive. A reason Germany or France don't have 800 of their tanks, which are even cheaper.

&gt;From what I could gather they want to push it all the way to 2.5% of GDP in the near future 

% of GDP is very uninteresting if you talk about that. It's a nice political number and to look at a trend, but doesn't state it in absolute numbers. The 2,5% are needed for the current acquisition without those tanks, as it's not much in absolute numbers. 

&gt;which along with the Immense GDP growth of Poland will provide A LOT of money to spend.

No higher GDP doesn't mean limitless spending and Poland has still a quite low GDP per capita compared to all it's EU neighbors.

4333,"&gt;Which classes of drugs from 1927 are being used in modern treatment of gender dysphoria in children? The ones I’ve seen are clearly more modern and have not historically been used to treat other conditions.

Which classes of drugs from 1927 are being used anywhere? I mean, other than extremely basic painkillers and antibiotics.

&gt;This gets murky if you don’t have numbers. We know how many children have been treated this was at Tavistock, but we don’t know how many are referred there. There’s little transparency or even rigour in diagnosis. Psychiatric diagnosis is far from being a science.

That's true, but if you were pressed, would you gind it more likely that a medical professional woild err on the side of caution when diagnosing gender dysphoria or... well, I had a figure of speech in mind, but I forgot it, but basically the opposite of what I just said about erring on the side of caution?

&gt;Delayed puberty is a medical condition that is treated. While there is some debate over the long-term outcomes, there is good evidence to suggest issues similar to what we see when puberty is inhibited. That we have a medical condition that affects a tiny percentage of people, with evidenced side effects from treatment, isn’t an argument for inducing the same condition. There’s a hell of a difference there.

Not saying that you're wrong, you're probably somewhat right here, but I was a late bloomer and I didn't get any sort of medical checkups relating to it. I know this is anecdotal as fuck, but I really don't know with this argument.

its like Poland woke up one day, look at itself in the mirror and thought it could fuck the same women Norway does. 
get real man.

in 20 years time Polands population will decrease by another 3 to 4 million, Poland already is 40 million people shy of actually being able to rival Germany or France or the UK, or even the Benelux.
the political capital isnt there because the west wants Poland isolated, you can see that with the imminent funding cuts, and previous attempt at triggering art7.

Poland is not an important player. even less so now since PiS got into power.
Macron said it perfectly, Poland will not now nor ever dictate the future of Europe.
we might as well let Estonia or Serbia do that if Poland ever gets the chance, thats how unlikely that possibility is of ever happening.

how are you going to be able to dictate the future of Europe or be part of the leadership if the west wants nothing to do with you?
its more than just money or political capital, its your international influence and prestige.
which Poland has little of.

it would take a sysmic shift of geopolitical change for Poland to ever be a leading role in the EU or Europe.

and that is all besides the point, Poland is dying as is. with the loss of millions of citizens moving west permanently and millions more yet to leave. the workforce isnt there, and never will be.

&gt; Opposition politicians know it. And WE politicians know it too. All support for EU and voting campaign for accession was built around that.

they lied to you and fed to your ego.

&gt; The moment WE would say that Poland will never be as important as other big countries (Like France, Germany or Italy) - is the moment when support for EU in Poland goes down the crapper.

anyone that genuinely thinks Poland is as important or ever will be as GB, FR or GR is either delusional, or lying to you.
its unrealistic for that to ever happen. especially now with PiS shitting on the west and killing good relations at every chance it gets.

In the last years, in Romania &amp; Poland (at least) investments in defense started to substantially grow. US is basically digging a trench in the EE, for the benefit of the EU as a whole and because they need to target other hotspots of great interest to them, not Russia. So a kind of hand-over of the defense in front of Russia is happening as we speak.

Now, UE acts pretty chaotically when it comes to military. I disliked very much the fact that Greece was kept on short leash since 2008; while in the same time the budget for the Greek military, ensuring safe waters and defense on the southern border was not seen as a service the GR has done for the EU, but as a expenditure of the Greek state, period. One could argue that the refugee crisis would have been much worse if Greece didn't do it's part, you know ....

So a common policy should be established for EU, and EU should agree on some common goals. I agree with both southern objectives and eastern ones, and IMHO a flexible defense architecture &amp; budget should be in place within borders of EU, since it has become very clear that US has divergent goals from us.

The first letter is always assigned to the voivodeship the powiat is in, the second and third are district indicators, usually assigned to the powiat. Cities without powiat rights just use district indicators of the powiats they're in.


The voivodeship letter only in the case of Silesia, Lower Silesia (Dolnośląskie), Lubelskie, Opolskie and Western Pomerania (Zachodniopomorskie) comes from the actual voivodeship name, in some cases it comes from the name of the biggest city in the voivodeship, as in the case of Lesser Poland (Kraków), Greater Poland (Poznań), Pomerania (Gdańsk) and Mazovia (Warsaw). In this case, the city usually as its powiat letter adds a second letter of its name to create KR, PO and GD license plates respectively. Warsaw is a different story because it has different powiat prefixes for each of its districts (even though the districts are only municipalities, not powiats). In the case of all the other voivodeships the letter is just random because some other voivodeship stole it's letter already. Lubelskie stole Łódzkie's and Lubuskie's L (and yes, Lubelskie vs Lubuskie causes a lot of confusion on geography lessons, especially that they are on the opposite sides of the country), Lesser Poland stole Kuyavia-Pomerania's K, I could go on and on.

4594," &gt;Electricity for cars is often lower. For example a quick search gave me a 22 cent price per kWh.

That is just not true. It's actually more expensive, especially with DC chargers you pay 0.40€ and more. Look at [ADAC e-Charge](https://www.adac.de/rund-ums-fahrzeug/elektromobilitaet/laden/adac-e-charge/) for example:

 * AC - 0,29 Euro / kWh
 * DC - 0,39 Euro / kWh

&gt; so you save at least 3€ per 100km you drive with the electric variant.

You also don't have to pay taxes for your EV which is another 150 - 200€ a year, and they're cheaper to maintain. According to Opel themselves, if you drive 10.000km a year, you save ~50€ a month with an EV over fuel, and ~30€ a month over diesel. Given the 6k you get from the government they break even *very* soon. I know.

But realistically they're also worse to use with limited range and limited charging options and uncertain resale value (likely shit resale value tbh). 500€ a year is apparently not enough to convince most so far. It's getting there, also with *again* reduced rates for company EVs (down from 0.5% to 0.25%) for example, I don't need to be convinced. But with cheaper energy there'd be even more of a gap, and that can only help.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/elxpml/polands_started_to_use_green_license_plates_for/fdnhclu/,afito,1578585824

He has zero knowledge about the origin of the crisis if he thinks that Palestinians just need to ""embrace democracy and peace"":

 [The elections that brought Hamas to power were completely democratic.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Palestinian_legislative_election)

&gt;The National Democratic Institute (NDI) in partnership with The Carter Center reported ""a professional and impartial performance of election officials"".[31] The European Union delegation reported ""there was nothing which would indicate that the final result was not the outcome chosen by the voters"".[32] A CRS Report for Congress on the 2006 elections concluded: ""The election was overseen by 17,268 domestic observers, complemented by 900 credentialed international monitors. ... The Bush Administration accepted the outcome of the Palestinian legislative elections and praised the PA for holding free and fair elections. ... The conduct of the election was widely considered to be free and fair.""[41]

Well, aside from one aspect:

&gt;During the elections, the Israeli authorities banned the candidates from holding election campaigns inside Jerusalem. Rallies and public meetings were prohibited. The Jerusalem identity cards of some PLC members were also revoked.[24] The Carter Center, which monitored the elections, criticised the detentions of persons who ""are guilty of nothing more than winning a parliamentary seat in an open and honest election"".

4687,"&gt; International tax principles that apply to every other industry say that the US, not France, should tax the tech giants, because virtually all their productive activity is in the US.

Thats false, most major tech companies have global HQ's so the productive activity is happening all over the world and no one country could really claim it. 

The issue in this case is that Facebook or Google often do not operate as US companies, but as European ones. Legally speaking at least.

&gt; France is pouting that it can't loot the tech giants under international tax principles, and so has invented new ones.

No, they are arguing that those companies over inflate their expenses, thus on paper reducing their profits by creating multiple legal entities that tax the shit out each other. 


&gt; France is the country unilaterally trying to loot other countries' companies. The US should certainly respond by taxing the revenues of French companies that sell to the US.

And in French or any other country case, the issue is not that they want to loot random companies, but that due to complicated legal structure, they manage to avoid a lot of taxes made from users in those countries. It's up to French to regulate how companies operate in their market and if those said companies don't like or feel like they are being looted, they can always leave the market. They won't get revenue and Frech won't get taxes, everyone is happy until someone fills the gap with missing services and starts to compete with US enterprises.

4721,"&gt; No, it existed prior to the troop withdrawal. It's founder Al Zarqawi was killed in 2006, long before the Obama administration. Being involved with Al Qaeda (yet also known to head his own group (IS)), he was a high-priority target in organized resistance and attacks on american forces. 

It existed as a tiny, fringe group. After the troop withdrawal Iraq was thrust into political chaos, where the disenfranchised found a home with them, and they grew rapidly. After that they started launching assaults in earnest in Iraq and Syria and became a global threat.

&gt; A common criticism is that the Obama administration was weak for not invading. Imagine he had not provided any form of support at all. The domestic response would have been to lynch him

Nobody in the United States wanted anything to do with the mess in Syria. Nobody, on either side. This was 100% warhawk shit.

&gt; Their defeat could largely be said to be due to US support of the SDF and kurdish forces in the north of Syria and Iraq. Not having done so would have made it far harder for the Russian backed Syrian army to do it all alone. These forces proved extremely decisive in breaking IS's hold of their defacto capital city Raqqa and running them out of eastern Syria. Without this pressure it is certain the war would not have ended as fast as it did.

Defeat of what? And as I said, ISIS did not exist as a major political entity prior to the withdrawal from Iraq. It just didn't. Even then, ISIS could have been fought separately, we weren't in Syria to fight ISIS, we were in Syria to nation-build as usual and depose a Russian ally in Bashar al-Assad. What we ended up doing was helping thrust a once stable and prosperous country into incredible ruin and turmoil and spark a massive refugee exodus from the region.

&gt; Except that the origin of IS predated leaving Iraq, and that IS really took off in Syria before returning to Iraq, and that he did effectively defeat them before his term ended. This group spawned because of the invasion - which he did not start.

Already addressed all of that. Try as you might, you can't rewrite history, we were in Iraq at the same time that ISIS ""was there"" without an issue because they hardly had a presence. Once we left, they grew, massively, and actually became a thing. I mean, the facts are literally right there in front of your face, if you were too young to remember this whole development Wikipedia is your friend. If you weren't then I have to ask you why you're resorting to this bs excuse since we were all paying attention to the news back then and know exactly how this materialized and in what order.

To translate these vague concerns: if Russia decides to halt gas sales to Poland, Poland wants to be able to continue taking gas from the pipeline if they see need. Which will affect the gas supply of Germany.

Similar, if Poland can’t import gas from other countries anymore (e.g. LNG terminal destroyed), they want to have the fallback of tapping the Gazprom pipe as a stopgap measure.

No it happened precisely because government restricted police hands with their official policies. Labour party when they ruled initiated vast changes to police to not target minorities and police was made to look at stats and if they had too much cases of such and such ethnicity this meant that they were probably racist and people heads would roll. Conservatives later took over but they didn't made any changes as they were probably unaware.

People think that police is stuffed rich people or something ? Most of police comes from people who didn't go to high school and most of them are from local communities. It is obvious that they want to fix shit but they can't if official policies care more about not offending minorities than to deal with issue.

Good example of that shit was stop and frisk policy in new york. Despite cries from left that it was targeting minorities it made city a lot safer and that didn't benefit rich.

5194,"Present Continues doesn't work here because it has two general uses:

1. something occuring as we speak

*Poland is starting using...* - implies that the process of starting is going on RIGHT NOW

2. something planned for a specific time in the future:

*Poland is starting to using the green plates this comming summer.*

or more relatable:

*I'm having a doctor appointment next friday.*


As for the debate between Past Simple and Present Perfect:

Past Simple is used to refer to something that is done (and finished) in the past.

*Poland started to use the green plates on that and that day.* - The process of starting is done in the past. They've used the plates since.

This brings me nicely to Present Perfect as I have just used it. (And again.)

Present Perfect is used for something that has started in the past and continues in the present.

*I have lived in Poland all my life.* - I still do.

You may now ask: if it's supposed to refer to something that is ongoing in the present would this not be the best tense to use here.

Well, no. The problem is with the verb *start*.

The sentence:

*Poland has started using the green plates.* Seems to work but I actually implies that the *process of starting* is what is ongoing, not the use of the plates. So this suggests that the rollout of the new plates hasn't been completed yet.

But you said *I have just used it*. This is not still ongoing.

Well, Present Perfect is an odd beast. It's also used whenever certain adverbialst are present and can often refer to very recent past.

If you encounter one of these adverbials then present perfect is in order (the list is not exhaustive): *just, recently, ever, never, yet, so far*, etc.

Examples:

*I have never seen a pig fly.*

*Have you finished your assingment yet?*

*I have recently moved to Warsaw.*

Also in cases when the use of one is implied:

*I have (just) arrived.*

You can also encounter this very unhelpful definition. *The present perfect [...] is used to express a past event that has present consequences.* (Thanks, wiki).

What this referes to (I think) is using present perfect with words *for* and *since*.

Examples:

*I have reddited for 6 years now.* - I have started 6 years ago and it is still going.

*I have reddited since 2014.* - Same meaning as above.

There are also situations in which present perfect breaks it's own rules. For example talking about experiences we could say:

*I have never seen a pig fly before.* - This implies that I have seen it just now. So the use of 'before' breaks the present continuity of present perfect but it's still correct. You may argue that this falls under the recent past/adverbials section but I just wanted to point this out.

There are probably other edge cases which I have not listed here.

Since I am already writing a wall of text, lets analyse your question, shall we?

*Why doesn’t work the present continues here?*

English, unlike some other languages, has very strict syntax. This is because english a very inflexible language and syntax provides meaning that certain languages (like polish for example) may convey through word flexion. This makes english much easier to learn.

The order of a statement in english is:

S- subject V-verb X-the rest.

*I live in Poland*.

Now questions:

In general you want to pull the auxiliary verb (to have, to be, will - depends on the tense) in front of the subject and leave the main verb (infinitive, gerund, or participle) in it's place. If there is no auxiliary verb (present simple, past simple) then you add an operator (do, does, did).

Examples:

Present Simple:

Statement: *He lives in Poland.*
Question: *Does he live in Poland?*

Here we have no auxiliary verbs and therefore we add an operator (does) at the beginning as well as bring the main verb to it's infinitive form. Past Simple works exactly the same way but the operator is 'did'.

Present Continues:

Statement: *I am typing a wall of text.*
Question: *Are you typing a wall of text?*

Present continues uses the auxiliary verb 'to be' in a personal form. We pull that in front and live the main verb in it's gerund form (with -ing) as is.

Present Perfect:

Statement: *I have lived in Poland all my life.*
Question: *Have you lived in Poland all your life?*

Again, but with an auxiliary verb 'to have'. Put it in front and leave the participle form (with -ed or whatever is the irregular form) in place.

Present Perfect Continues:

Statement: *It's been raining for hours.*
Question: *Has it been raining for hours?*

Present Perfect continues has two auxiliary verbs and the one moved is always 'to have'.

I don't think this requires more explaining/examples.

Okay, so we have yes/no questions behind us. How about if I want to use a question word?

This is really easy. Just put the question word in front of an already formed yes/no question (and delete whatever you are asking for from the rest of the sentence). I'm just gonna redo all the questions I just listed but with question words.

*Where does he live?*
*What are you typing?*
*Where have you lived all your life?*
*How long has it been raining for?*

5203,"My cis sister was given blockers for years due to a disorder that caused her to start puberty too early. She was given the same blockers that trans youth are provided with, and puberty paused whilst she was one them, then carried on as it would normally once she went off them. She was on blockers for 6 years with no adverse effects.

I've known a number of trans people on them (I'm trans myself) and the same applies; if they stop the blockers and do not take other hormones, then puberty resumes as it would normally. It's essentially like pressing ""pause"".

The blockers used on those with early puberty and on those wishing to transition are tried and tested and have been used for decades on those with early puberty or puberty disorders, as well as on menopausal women in some cases. 

I think people often hear ""puberty blockers"" and ""hormone treatment"" and get scared, because it sounds serious and a lot of people haven't heard about it until recently. But when a trans person is on blockers and/or hormones, the process is often heavily monitored by medical professionals; it isn't some shady doctor handing out hormones to anyone who asks. It's a long process and the person will have regular check-ins and blood tests to make sure things are going smoothly.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, it pisses me off when people call puberty blockers ""experimental"" or ""dangerous"" or similar things, because they're not new at all and those words are only used when referring to trans kids receiving them.

5207,"Hello fellow Madrileño! 


First off, your sentence _Why doesn't work the present continues here._ I can see how when you translate the structure of the sentence from how you said it in Spanish you would arrive at this. The sentence should be ""Why doesn't the present continuous work here?""

I think the present continuous would actually work, assuming that Poland plans on continuing to introduce more of these license plates. The phrasing would just be different. Then it would be ""Poland's (contraction of Poland is) start*ing* to use green license plates... As in, they are starting to introduce them and will continue to do so. The same as in spanish as if you said ""Polonia esta empezando a...""

The way the OP wrote the title (forgetting the apostrophe) was ""Poland's (contraction of Poland has) started to use... The same in Spanish as if you said ""Polonia ha empezado a usar estas matriculas...""

I'm not sure why the previous poster said the present continuous wouldn't work, since that's how a lot of people would say it, at least colloquially. Maybe it's not the _best_ way to say it, but it doesn't sound wrong to me, and I'm a native English speaker.

5221,"I have family in the force and we have done for 3 generations now back to my Grampa.

From what I've heard around the dinner table it's abysmally overrun with intersectional identity politics, woke culture etc. Most of the older coppers don't really understand it and just know it as ""political correctness gone mad"", which it is, but it goes so much deeper ideologically speaking.

There's basically an ongoing attempt to inject Marxist inspired [critical criminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_criminology) into the justice system at all levels, obliterating the ideal of universal rule of law in favour of contextualising crimes in one's supposed position of social privilege. This is why crimes committed by one ethnic group are treated differently to another, why a girl's whiteness somehow offsets her working class background but there's no real coherency to it and it becomes a giant ugly racist mess.

It's frankly disgusting but the good news is that basically all the cops on the inside at the beat level think as much. It's coming from the top, it's all the detached police commissioner and executive types that tell them they need to act this way, none of them actually want to.

They see this sort of shit on the news, they are disgusted by it and it's fuelling a lot of anger. They know it's bad, they see it every day, and the cops are *generally* decent people who actually want to do good.

What's most alarming is how corrupted and destructive the senior leadership in our force have become. My Dad nearly got fired sticking his neck out against policies that were essentially advocating ""diversity"" racist hiring policies. A few years later we then saw the [Cheshire police found guilty of discrimination against a white male](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-47335859), he felt utterly vindicated. But I'd say what's notable in that case was that the father, a DI himself, lodged the complainant - probably because he saw just how fucked things were on the inside as my own Dad did.

5284,"OK, so let's see. I asked you to come up with reasons for why the situation with Iran and the US is the way it is. You cite misogyny and anti-semitism. See where this is going?

The US is allied with Egypt, KSA, UAE, Qatar and Iraq. Now let's look at the track record.

# Jews in the Persian Gulf region

Country|US ally|Jews in country|Jews descended from country in diaspora|Note
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
KSA|Yes|0|0|Non-Muslim faiths prohibited, not a recent development
UAE|Yes|~3,000|N/A|First synagogue opened in 2008
Qatar|Yes|0|N/A|Jewish US soldiers stationed in Qatar now receive kosher rations
Egypt|Yes|&lt; 20|57,500|Jews either expelled or detained and tortured in the aftermath of 1967
Iraq|Yes|&lt; 10|228,000–600,000|Sectarian violence make life for Jews impossible
**Iran**|**No**|**10,000**|**130,000**|**Jews protected, represented in Parliament**

I will concede that Iran has problems with anti-semitism, and *a lot* of room to improve there. But if you thought it was good to cite this as the reason for US-Iran relations, then I hope you can see how you embarrassed yourself.

Hey, let's do the same exercise with misogyny and see if minds will blow.

# Women in the Persian Gulf region

Country|US ally|In labour force|Secondary education|Note
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
KSA|Yes|16%|73%|Women got the historic right to drive... in 2017
UAE|Yes|43%|73%|Making great progress quickly (no sarcasm)
Egypt|Yes|26%|43%|Ranks worst for women's rights of all Arab states
Iraq|Yes|16%|22%|Female genital mutilation prevalent among Kurds
**Iran**|**No**|**49%**|**62%**|**70% of STEM students**

So when you said that i ***NEED*** to talk about misogyny and anti-semtism, did you mean that Iran doesn't have enough of it to be a US ally?

&gt; You need to talk about their expansive goals in the ME and their desire to spread Islam. They have been too weak to expand as much as they would like, but they have made it clear that is exactly their goal.

Meh. We can do the same exercise here but I'm going to leave this one for you to figure out all on your own. I will say this though, it is quite obvious from your other statements that you are opposed to Islam as a whole. You're saying that Sweden ""will get a taste"" of how supposedly bad Islam is. I agree that Islam as a whole is in a really bad state right now, it's in a dark age. But to condemn the entire religion is not intellectually honest, and it really does help expose your bias.

&gt; So it is ok they were fascist because of a war?

Of course not. Read what I wrote one more time, is that really the takeaway?

&gt; They have supported Shia terrorists and militias all across the region, and gullible people like you think that means they officially want peace and are just misunderstood. 

They started this policy as a way to counter US expansionism. It has been successful. Iran has also offered to cease with these tactics and completely cut ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon, in exchange for mutual cooperation with the US in rebuilding Iraq. The US refused.

Now this. If you don't comprehend how the US government is actively working to destabilize the Middle East as a tool to control Asia and Europe, then you are going to be super surprised in 10 years when Europe makes formal defense agreements with Asia and the US still stands on the sideline fuming about ""shared values"".

Exactly 38.2 percent obliged believers take part in Sunday masses (38.3% in 2017), and 17.3% Catholics receive communion (17 percent in 2017). This is the result of data provided by the Institute of Statistics of the Catholic Church (ISKK). The former are according to church names dominicantes, the latter are communicantes. Who are the ""obligated""? They are Catholics who should practice. Children under the age of 7 and older children with mobility problems are excluded. ISKK assumed that these two groups are 18 percent. all Catholics. After conversion 38.2 percent only 31.3% all baptized.

&amp;#x200B;

The data relate to 2018, because it collects and publishes with ISKK with a year delay. - Small differences compared to the previous year are on the verge of statistical error, therefore they cannot be the basis for drawing conclusions as to the possible decrease or increase. It can be argued that the religious practices of Catholics in Poland are at a constant level - commented, presenting the results of the research, Father dr Wojciech Sadłoń, head of ISKK.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The highest levels of the dominicantes indicator were recorded in the diocese of Tarnów (71.3%; in 2017 - 71.7%), Rzeszów (64.1%, unchanged) and Przemyśl (60.4%; 59.8 in 2017). The least attends masses in the Szczecin-Kamieniec diocese - 24.1 percent (in 25.6% of 2017), in Łódź - 24.5% (24.6 percent) and Koszalin-Kołobrzeg - one in four faithful (0.6 percent less than a year ago).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How many priests are there in Poland?

According to church statistics, there are exactly 24,000 in Poland. 876 priests (in 2017 - 24,000 917). However, 20.6 thousand work in parishes, 300 less than in 2017. The number of nuns dropped slightly - from 17.9 to 17.7 thousand. In turn, there were 11.4 thousand in male religious orders. religious. About two hundred fewer than in 2017. Every third of them stays abroad.

&amp;#x200B;

How does the church collect data?

During one Sunday in October, priests and altar boys count the faithful who leave the churches and receive communion. Then compare these data with the number of so-called Catholics required to practice. The obligation does not apply to children under the age of seven, as well as older people who have mobility problems. ISKK has top-down accepted that these two groups are 18 percent. Catholics.

&amp;#x200B;

The method of collecting church statistics was criticized a year ago by prof. Józef Baniak, a sociologist from the University of Adam Mickiewicz. - Altar boys randomly calculate the number of participants in the mass and communions received at that time in the temple, and later pass this data on to the priest. He sends them to the episcopal curia, from where they go to researchers of the Institute of Statistics of the Catholic Church - he explained.

&amp;#x200B;

And he added: - The priest cannot provide too low data, because it will have a negative impact on the perception of his parish. It is important above all for the bishop to be happy and for the priest to have peace.

&amp;#x200B;

The survey covered 92.6 percent. out of 10 thousand 551 Polish parishes. However, there are dioceses where surveys were not sent even by every third parish. This was the case in the dioceses of Warmia and Płock. In the dioceses of Sandomierz or Katowice, data did not provide 22.8 percent, respectively. and 21.1 percent parish.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Update In the first paragraph I explained that 38.2 percent. the faithful are really ""committed faithful"". The ISKK definition excludes children under the age of 7 and older people from this group. After conversion, this will only give 31.3 percent. baptized.

She was diagnosed as ""support level 2 autistic"" and spent 10 years of her life wondering whether she was supposed to be a man, but never followed through on it because she was poor as fuck and didn't have the means.

My brother, who is even more mildly autistic than I am, was hardcore cross dressing for a while (fake tits and all) and settled on some more casual version of that eventually.

5533,"Actually, you're wrong. 

The Sykes-Picot Agreement drew the borders of modern-day Iraq and Syria without any regards for the myriad of different religious and ethnic groups in them, which is why the Kurds have been fighting for independence across the north of the entire region for decades, Syria has Turkmen minorities who are siding with the Turks in the current invasion, Iraq is a Shia majority country governed by a Sunni minority and there are Yazidi, Assyrian and other minority groups across the entire region who lack representation.

Europe forged itself over hundreds of years of warring, treaty drawing and negotiations, and up until *very fucking recently*, ie the 1990s, Europeans were killing each-other over ancient borders and treaties - oh wait, considering Crimea and the War in Ukraine and where the ideas of Russian sovereignty over the Peninsula of Crimea come from, we still **are** warring over old border disputes and treaties. Even so, this is a completely different scenario from having an outside force come in and completely define the borders of the region overnight for their own purposes without any clue as to the people living within those borders.

So yes, France **does** have responsibility for modern problems with the Sykes-Picot agreement, and even if you disagree, it doesn't matter because you're ignoring the fact that France was **the** most active NATO member in airstrikes and missions over Libya, which is a huge cause of instability and refugees.

5580,"&gt;Ukrainians tried to claim and take over Polish-majority cities. They lost. Polish-Ukrainian war: the story.

Ukrainians rose up in western Ukraine/Galizia, Poles tried to intervene, Ukrainians proceeded to destory them, while at the same time fighting Bolsheviks. Poland used Blue army to destroy Ukrainian army, which was directly against agreements with western allies, thus allowing Bolsheviks to conquer Ukraine. Fixed that for you.

&gt; And then end up with Russian Empire reemerging and claiming our lands  again? Hell no, Polish strategy was to prolong the Russian civil war for  the longest possible duration, so both sides can have fun. 

Indeed, Soviet Union with mad Ukrainians was a lot better neighbour than reemergnig Russian Empire. And it worked so great for Poland in the end!!

Your lack of self awareness is kind of funny, not gonna lie. Anyway, at very least read your own sources :

"" In 1996, Paris and Moscow signed an accord to write off the tsarist debt. ""

&gt; It literally isn't. 

You use ""literally"" in every second sentence lol... considering you usually write it just before you write some made up BS i think you dont understand the meaning of said word. So pls look it up before you write some more non-sense.

&gt; They literally did not. And Soviet Union literally refused to pay even a dime of those.  

""However, in the mid-1990s Russia signed an agreement with France  over the Romanov government’s debts and paid Paris 330 million euros. ""

From your own god damn sources. But somehow they ""literally"" didnt pay a dime of those hahaha.

It was never salvageable. But, if you want to trade with Iran, go ahead. Just try not to violate the UN sanctions.

5819,"&gt;It took a few villages it already controlled once in the 1918-19 period before Czechoslovak aggression.

Yea, during the Polish aggresion of 1918. But thats off-topic.

&gt;Quite the contrary, they refused *because*  they were naive. A result of their babbling about ""honour"" was 6  million Polish citizens killed, and pretty much all of our major cities  either lost forever to foreign powers (Lwów, Wilno), or in ruins  (Warsaw, Poznań).

Poles were naive enough to believe in UK and France, but not naive enough to believe Germany. Simple as that.

&gt;Not being hostile to Germany was real politics

and it worked splendidly lol.. they played Poland like a fiddle

&gt;Significantly less so than Soviet occupation. By about 51 times.

Nope, Soviets took back their territory, meanwhile Poles annexed they territory never owned.

&gt;It is relevant, because 10-20% of population

So is it 10 or 20? Significant difference lol. And you are wrong, [Soviet nationalities had majority in most of those areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_census_of_1931).

&gt;Also, the Lwów area (which was ethnically mixed in a way Yugoslavia was,  with approximately 40/40/20 Polish/Ukrainian/Jewish population in  total, many pockets of local majorities including huge Polish-Jewish  majorities in most cities) was *never* a part of Russia/Soviet Russia/Soviet Union at any point before 1939.

Just like parts of Zaolzie that Poland occupied had never been part of Poland. Interesting right? hahaha

&gt;Ukrainian SSR and Belorussian SSR were in USSR. End of story.  
&gt;  
&gt;6  million of Ukrainians were killed in the Holodomor genocide during the  1932-1933 period by the government of USSR/Ukrainian SSR. End of story.  Calling it an ""Ukrainian"" state is an insult to the memory of the  murdered.

Poland pretty much took the part of Ukraine it wanted, and then threw the rest of the Ukraine under the bus. And then acted suprised, when Ukraine came back for its territories.. lmao

I am going to remind you, that Poland had an alliance with Ukraine in 1919. Both states fought together against Soviet Russia and had a deal that none of them will make a separate peace agreement with Soviets. Yet, Poles stabbed Ukraine (surprise, surprise) in the back and signed peace agreement. And thus Ukraine SSR joined USSR.

You may not like it but thats how it is, Poland was one of the reasons why Ukraine joined Soviet Union and you crying about it wont change a thing.

&gt;Zaolzie had 220,000 people, areas of Poland annexed by USSR had  15,000,000. That's like comparing an apple, with a truck full of  oranges.

In both cases the invading nations recaptured territory with their minority, which they lost in war in 1919, because they were preoccupied with other invaders. And in both cases they did it together with Germans. Tho personally I would say the first one was more significant, since without it there wouldnt even be a world war - &gt; germany wouldnt have industrial capacity and army to do anything significant in europe.",,/r/europe/comments/ela9ji/chess_legend_kasparov_says_there_is_no_doubt/fdk9zup/,ElectricianSVK,1578499425

5883,"&gt;But what for? Literally all Poland wanted was a return to January 1919 lines of control, full-scale invasion of Czechoslovakia wasn't needed for that in the slightest.

Meanwhile Poland was slowly invading Northern Slovakia. Nice one.

&gt;On a flipside, original Prague still exists in contrast to Rotterdam. Or Warsaw for that matter.

Yep

&gt;No, the price was to let Germany annex the Free City of Danzig (which  was in customs union with Poland), and let Germany build a highway and  railroad through the Pomeranian voivodship, which would be  exterritorial.

Even Polish leaders at the time werent this naive. Thats why they refused it.

&gt;Polish relations with Germany post-1933 actually *improved slightly*  compared with the Weimar republic period, so if anything you only made  your position even harder to defend with that clarification.

Of course it improved, I already told you that Poland were great friends with nazis. I am just saying that being friends with Germany was extremely short sighted from Poland.

&gt;It was less than a 1% of pre-1938 Czechoslovak territory. About 900 square km if I recall correctly.

Yep, kinda significant

&gt;Literaly an order of magnitude and a half less than with Soviet  invasions, and I'll remind you that Soviets also invaded five other  countries as a result of their deal with Germany.

Another lies. The only country Soviets invaded was Finland.

&gt;Because you say so? Pretty sure anexing half of a country vs annexing  three villages and a town is not ""same fucking shit"" regardless of how  you look at it.

Lmao. You literally said that Poles just took back ""disputed territory"" with Polish minority that Czechoslovakia took in 1919. Same shit as Soviets taking whole Eastern Poland, which Poland took in 1919 and which had Soviet minorities. Literally the same shit. And whatever it was 5 % or 50% is irrelevant since all it says is half of Poland wasnt even Polish..  the important thing is that both countries used the same justification for their invasions.

&gt;Soviets were as much a ""Belarusian"" or ""Ukrainian"" country, as Poland was. There was no ""Soviet"" ethnicity.

Ukrainian SSR and Belorussian SSR were in USSR. End of story.

&gt;And in any case, on the territories of Poland annexed by USSR, Poles  were a plurality, at 38%, compared to 36% of Ukrainians and Belarusians  at 12%. With significant Polish majorities in many regions and cities.  About 6 million ethnic Poles lived there, that's more people than there  are Slovaks in Slovakia right now, not to even mention 1930s.

indeed, there were parts of Eastern Poland, where Poles had a majority. Most of the Poles were in Northern part of Eastern Poland, on the border with Lithuania. Rest of the Eastern Poland was populated by Belorussians and Ukrainians.

Its similar to Zaolzie (i am talking about the part which was occupied by Poland after Munich), which also had plenty of districts with Czech majority.

Yes, I would support it because IRGC is a designated FTO. What, do you expect that after 50 years or terror attacks targeting our civilians, embassies, FOBs, and military personnel and equipment that we should let you anywhere near our borders?

We don’t lay out the red carpet for hostile enemies who utilize asymmetrical warfare and terror to target civilians, attack diplomatic staff, and other acts of war, especially when they are designated terror groups.

I fully support war against Iran. But don’t get it twisted - Iran initiated hostilities when they attacked a US embassy during the Islamic revolution over 50 years ago...

Also, Iran already operates throughout the western hemisphere: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-113hhrg85689/html/CHRG-113hhrg85689.htm
