Where did you get 58.66% from?  Northern Ireland at the time was about 40% nationalist. Do you seriously think that 97% of unionists voted? No. Brexit was the highest turnout ever, and it was under 80%.

Don’t be so naive about official figures from the time.  The government was an apartheid regime notorious for faking elections.

Everyone in the EU and USA saw a 99% unionist vote as a farce.  They acted accordingly.

The result did not stand.  The government was broken up and Home Rule cancelled.

141,"Negative.  Economic success in China and Europe has proven possible largely because of the economic concessions allowed and security environment imposed by the Americans. The Americans pay for the global trade and security order in order to purchase the cooperation of the Bretton Woods allies, but the war the Americans needed the allies for ended three decades ago. The Americans no longer get much utility from the Order that makes everyone else's systems possible.

Do you pay for the US Navy's protection that allows your wonderful exports to safely transit the world's seas without anyone bothering them, hijacking them, or forcing you to pay a toll?  It's free, isn't it?  That's part of the problem.  You're free riding on the Americans.  

Follow me back to 1946. Europe is ruined, China is still a backwater. The USA puts together an alliance that allows everyone within it to trade goods into the US without significant trade barriers. This allows for Europe to export their way back to prosperity after WWII. It gives them room to grow their economies beyond what their somewhat depleted populations will allow. In addition to allowing the free flow of goods, the USA becomes the security guarantor of the free world by using our navy to police the world's oceans and enable low risk (and hence low cost) global trade.

But there was a condition. In order to deal with the US, you had to be on our side in helping to combat and contain the Soviet Union. Essentially the US traded some of its economic/manufacturing capacity for increased security and strategic assets to assist in the cold war. Only one problem: We won. The Soviet flag went down in 1991, and we didn't really make any changes to the world order. George H. W. Bush tried to reinvent the system, and we booted him out of office after a single term. Since then, the people of the US have voted overwhelmingly for candidates who focus on domestic rather than foreign issues. The system limped along for another few decades, primarily because of the USA's massive demand for oil and energy resources.

We're done protecting the world and getting nothing in return.  They only beat us on trade the past few decades because we let them. We're not letting them any more. Globalization is over. Free trade is over. The rest of the world riding on America's back is over. Atlas is shrugging. And to any Europeans here, I'm not trying to be mean, I don't have anything against you. But you can't expect a free ride to last forever. And you guys really, really shouldn't have stopped having kids. Once your boomer equivalents retire and you don't have the tax base to pay for their benefits or the young consumers to drive the economy, you're looking at decades of stagnation, spending cuts, and tax increases. Incidentally, this is why the EU is importing migrants as fast as they possibly can.

In fact, some of Britain's most important markets weren't within the Empire formally at all, like Argentina or the Boer states.

This is only common sense if you don't understand having such a deep attachment to a specific identity or group that you're willing to die and kill for it. If anything, I see this sort of self-defense is a self-evident need. Also, your morality is cosmopolitan to such an extent that it can't adequately defend itself, since, in an effort to be egalitarian and unbiased, the benefit of the doubt is given where it shouldn't be, and ill-intentioned minorities can simply exploit the system in the name of equality. Or they are handed the reins and entrusted to not repeat the mistakes of the old guard. But oppression doesn't breed unbiased people - it breeds consequentialists like me.

And as far as ""how the world should work"" is concerned, proposing and striving for utopianist ideals is *not* necessarily a good thing, and might be actively bad. These visions must be workable, too.

&gt; You make points like this... so now because there was only 72% turnout that means we're bad and don't give a shit about your organisation

More than half of you in England and Wales absolutely hate it, mind you. And yes, 72% is low compared to the absolute clusterfuck that is now happening because of the vote. In the end, that is more your problem than it is mine, though.

&gt; organisation that started as a coal and steel union and no apparently has a legal mandate to be ""ever closer""

So you're a concern troll? Because this is a staple Brexiteer talking point. What are you still doing in Germany then? Shouldn't you be heading back to the glorious empire by now?

The European Union, ironically, has been an *incredible* boon to both Ireland and the United Kingdom. You had multinationals across the globe *battling* to obtain a spot in London, where they could access the Single Market and its gigantic consumer base while simultaneously reside in an English-speaking region and benefiting from a lax and conservative corporate tax code. People don't think of the City of London as a haven of fraud for nothing. You exploted and used the European Union and now you're too proud to admit your profiteering and you're discarding your main source of miraculous growth the past decades.

The E.U. provides a powerful trading bloc, a large group of trained negotiators capable of forcing through beneficial trade agreements for all E.U. members. That sort of negotiating power would be severely diminished without the sheer size of the alliance. English people get benefits all over Europe when they're sick or unemployed. They can travel and work everywhere and eagerly do so. Yet this is all about ""what has the E.U. done for us lately"" - the sheer delusional entitlement is palpable.

We're not just talking about ""criticism"" of the E.U. here: as I've shown in several comments now, with sources, your pride and nationalism escalated anti-E.U. rhetoric and lies to such an extent, it severely damaged European unity, severely disrupted your own internal stability, emboldened foreign despots to create dissension and strife, encouraged a climate of hatred which has led to violence and hate crimes on countless occasions, and *still*, the best thing you can come up with is another jeremiad about how the E.U. is some kind of evil threat to British sovereignty.

Boris Johnson the political figure was bred inside this hate machine:

&gt; **Confidence and reality are two different things, and Johnson has never been that interested in the latter.** He was fired from his first job, at the Times of London, in 1988, for making up quotes from his godfather, an Oxford don. **A year later, he was sent to Brussels by the Daily Telegraph to write about the European Union, where his father had been a senior bureaucrat in the seventies. At the time, the E.U was covered seriously and reverentially by most British newspapers, but, with the dawning of Euroskepticism in the Conservative Party, Johnson spotted an opportunity to write about it differently. Johnson’s stories soon became full of the bloc’s supposed absurdities—rules about straight bananas, fishermen wearing hairnets, an E.U. skyscraper two miles high—often confected or based on deliberate misunderstandings.** 

&gt; Such stories have become a staple of right-wing British journalism ever since. “He made it seem like a game,” Sonia Purnell, who was Johnson’s deputy in the Telegraph’s bureau at the time, told me. “A pretty scary game, where he always pushed everything to the absolute outer limits of truth.” **In 2012, Purnell wrote a biography of Johnson, in which she described his daily ritual, as a young journalist, of yelling obscenities at a yucca plant on his desk, in order to raise his adrenaline to write his next assault on the bloc. “This bizarre ritual, to those who witnessed it, was an insight into the torrent of focus and drive that lies beneath Boris’s affable exterior,” she wrote.**

Humans, for Hazony, are not primarily individuals: they are first and foremost members of collectives, such as the family, tribe, or religious community. These collectives imbue their members with an identity —transmitted through language, belief, and tradition — and the individuals that make up a collective will in turn view it as part of their own extended selves, producing feelings of solidarity and mutual loyalty among the members of the group.

461,"&gt; So you're telling me you have your head so far up your ass, that you refuse to even consider. OK.

Consider what ? As I said you produced no demonstration, and you couldn't anyway because it's impossible. I am the one who would have to show you how Macron is a radical. That's the only point you contest right ? All other points, you either already agreed to or conceded ? That Mélenchon, Fillon and Le Pen have radical programs, that the FN has a Nazi historical core holding influence, and that Mélenchon as an eco-socialist has nothing to do with ""black blocs"". You can't demonstrate that Macron isn't something, it's for me to illustrate how he is.

And for that I need to care about you, which brings me to the next bit: Why, *why* would I indulge someone behaving like you do ? It makes no sense. Make it worth it. If you start to become courteous, apologize for the previous language, and start afresh an actually friendly interaction, then I will indulge and make the effort to elaborate and source.

472,"&gt;Of course it can't steer policy.

Of course they can: By making laws and by exercising their constitutional prerogatives, like initiating a presidential recall referendum. What do you think the legislative branch does?

&gt;foreign collusion

What do you mean? Bring evidence.

&gt; collusion with the military

What are you referring to? Both the armed forces and the [paramilitaries (""*colectivos*"")](https://elpitazo.com/occidente/comandante-de-la-zodi-en-lara-admite-que-colectivos-trabajan-con-la-gn/) ([bonus](http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/politica/momento-que-gnb-permitio-que-colectivos-entraran-asamblea_191574)) back the despot. Or do you think the opposition orders to oppress and [repress](https://www.vibby.com/watch?vib=X1vXv6lnQ) itself?

&gt;street violence

With all the constitutional roads blocked and all the unlawful and brutal repression, of course violence is the last resource. However, it's worth noting that no political leader in the opposition called for violence, quite the opposite. Moreover, the majority of protests have been peaceful and the violent individuals among the opposition are a minority.

&gt;I fucking love when food packages for the poor are supposed to prove somehow that the government is evil.

One of the ""ingredients"" of [Castro's recipe](http://lasarmasdecoronel.blogspot.com/2016/03/un-grave-alerta-de-guaicaipuro-lameda.html) is exactly making everyone poor so that they're completely dependent on the handouts of the regime.

&gt; If the opposition are liberal opportunists who'd cut the welfare state, and Maduro is not, then yes, they vote for him.

There's no welfare state to start with. In Venezuela, ""social missions"" are oriented to get political consensus, and in any case nothing works anymore due to total lack of resources, and because the economy has collapsed. Also, indirect subsidies (e.g. free electricity, petrol, subsidised food) are regressive measures, meaning that they benefit those who consume the most. Brilliant!

&gt;The regional courts discovered identity theft and fraud during the first phase of the referendum. 

How? The only authority able to ascertain that is the electoral body with its machines, and in August 2016 it had certified that the number of legitimate signatures exceeded the minimum threshold. Note that the five criminal courts had all issued the same exact ruling at the same time.

&gt;&gt;but why wouldn't a criminal court not judge about this? 

Because it would have been an *electoral* fraud. At best the lower courts would've had an ancillary function in the case.

&gt;&gt;Both the electoral body and the judiciary are in the grip of chavismo.

&gt;Yes, it's called fusion of powers, a concept in many parliamentarian democracies.

Here your ignorance shines through, Mr Leninist! Look up ""separation of powers"", which is the bedrock of modern democracies. The judiciary is never fused.

&gt; can pay protestors

There's no need to: the majority is against the despot.

&gt;artifical shortages

If true, such acts deserve condemnation. However, it is clear that the actual cause of shortages are the price controls which are way below production costs and an inability to get foreign currency due to currency controls (the regime assigns foreign currency and sets the exchange rate). All the anti-market laws and bureacuracy, oriented to destroy the private sector, did the rest. (Also, [this is a glimpe](https://apnews.com/64794f2594de47328b910dc29dd7c996) into the corruption that that system enables.)

Let me elaborate: During the boom years, cheap imports financed with huge inflows of petrodollars as well as with the quintuplication of the dollar-denominated external debt reduced the domestic production capacity as a result of the unfair competition. Now that even the oil production is [collapsing](https://platts.com/IM.Platts.Content/Downloads/charts/oil/2018/OPR_20180615_Venezuelan_Oil_updated._540pxjpg.jpg) due to colossal levels of mismanagement the illusory wealth based on an unsustainable consumption boom and cheap imports is gone. [This is a good introuction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5V6Flu-eHY) of the subject.

&gt; foreign collusion. 

Even if all that were true, that's nothing compared to the 1 trillion dollars earned in the last oil boom, of which nothing is left.

&gt; It's also worth noting that Chavismo has greatly reduced the numbers of people living in abject poverty. 

Again: 60% of people in Venezuela were in extreme poverty in 2017, and most are starving. Why do you think the tyranny has stopped publishing social and economic indicators, such as poverty levels, inflation rate and the GDP?

543,"Well it's understandable you have a legitimate negative view if you work in the financial sector. 

Since the Finance sector was responsible for the 2008 crash of the world economy politicians wanted to restrict the sector with policies that would mitigate any further crashes in the future. That would include less risk taking of financial institutions, which of course leads to less revenue which bankers just can't stand, even if it's reasonable.  

Now to why everyone else has the negative way of GB.  
Let's begin with the crash here as well.
During the crash itself, while everyone was working to prop the Euro, the UK government did take steps to detach themselves even more from the fiscal union instead of supporting the efforts of the commision.

The refusal to commit to the union by going into the fiscal union and refusing to sign the schengen treaty, taking Ireland with them, already gave continentals the impression the UK is not there for a united Europe, but that it's there for a purely selfish reason, benefitting from the monetary and customs union and only likes benefitting of it but despises giving in, by i.e. wanting the rebate.  
I am aware that the rebate was implemented because the UK does benefit little from some of the programs, like the CAP, which btw was already implemented before the UK was admitted into the EU, so in my opinion, it is uncalled for to demand a rebate, since the government would have to be aware that the CAP was in effect and you could analyse beforehand how much your contribution to the Union would be and it still wished to enter.

Lastly the UK Government did take the right to opt - out of laws and regulations the EU deemed necessary, and allowing then to have a special status on a Union of equals, for the sole reason to have laxer regulations, allowing corporates interest in the UK to gain more revenue and the UK Government to expand their surveillance state across the Isles.
It works now closer to the modus operandi the American society applies, which also lend to speculation , that the UK is influenced by American interests.

Coupled with the constant criticism on the EU by the murdoch media Empire, and the constant bickering in the EU Parliament by UKIP, the UK always gave the impression, that they don't think that the European project should go forward and wants only to maintain their superior position in the EU without contributing to the Union as the other member states do.  
(I'm not saying some of the criticism weren't reasonable or necessary, but as an outsider I got the impression no one gave an effort to see the positives of being in the EU)

By constantly demanding special rights in every way possible, which were all granted, and still voting for Brexit in a referendum is absolutely incomprehensible by anyone which tried to placate you every time you threw a tantrum for being treated equally as the rest of the union.

I do not enjoy Britain breaking off, but I never got why it should be treated differently than any other member. When you guys are ready to change your attitude, I will be glad to see you back, though :)

554,"&gt;Yes, the opposition in late 2015 took the majority of the seats in parliament, and support is dwindling because in a dictatorship representatives cannot steer policy and because the international community, including the Obama administration and the EU, forced the inappropriately named dialogue upon the opposition.

Well, the opposition is not the government. Of course it can't steer policy. The reason the support is dwindling is disunity among the MUD, foreign collusion, collusion with the military, street violence. They only have themselves to blame for it. They have many media outlets on their site, and Venezuela is going through an economic crisis.

&gt;Surely Maduro's acceptance rate is no better, and those who support him do so not to starve in that political apartheid.

Yes, if you feed the poor those are going to vote for you. I fucking love when food packages for the poor are supposed to prove somehow that the government is evil. America too had breadlines during the Great Depression, and at those you'd line up for hours. If the opposition are liberal opportunists who'd cut the welfare state, and Maduro is not, then yes, they vote for him. 

&gt;You see, on October 20th 2016 the Maduro regime officially became despotic as the electoral body abode by the illegal ruling of five criminal courts which have no jurisdiction over electoral matters given that it is the electoral chamber of the supreme court that does. Both the electoral body and the judiciary are in the grip of chavismo.

&gt;By abiding by the illegal rulings on grounds of irregularities allegedly occurred in a phase of the recall referendum the electoral body was in contradiction with itself given that in August it had certified the completion of that phase.

The regional courts discovered identity theft and fraud during the first phase of the referendum. I am not an expert on Venezuelan constitutional law, but why wouldn't a criminal court not judge about this? They didn't *stop* the gathering of signatures, the electoral panel did after those verdicts. They didn't have to. In 2004 the opposition tried the same with Chavez and lost. They are obsessed by ousting the PSUV from the presidential office.

&gt;Both the electoral body and the judiciary are in the grip of chavismo.

Yes, it's called fusion of powers, a concept in many parliamentarian democracies.

&gt;Also, considering that in 2017 almost nine in ten Venezuelans were poor, and three in five were extremely poor according to a survey conducted by the three leading universities in Venezuela, the wealthy are numerically negligible both in the elections and in opinion polls.

He is saying that the state and politicians have the right to decide how people should identify, and what makes the statement especially horrible is that he is trying to make both the Sami and Jews out as groups that do not belong in Sweden, that are allowed to live here only thanks to the goodness of the Swedes. Considering the crimes that have been committed against the Jews (I hope I don't have to explain what happend) and the Sapmi (making them out to be sub-human, forced labour, purging of their religion, attempts to get rid of their language, segregation, colonization, state expropriation of Sapmi lands etc.), creating a rhetoric against these groups is not ok.

Heavy American center-left bias and very obviously the content is produced and made by Americans, for Americans. Hence all the factual mistakes they make in their videos and lack of understanding that what they are trying to portray as fact is but one of the possible perspective towards the situation. Generally, American media is a lot more skeptical towards the prospects of the EU than their European counterparts. Even American center-left media generally is mostly about ""danger"" in the EU. European center-left media is all about pro-EU. I am not sure how to explain it, but it is getting to ludicrous heights how delusional they are. A couple more years of stupid content like this and I am going to start seeing it more nefarious than just being oblivious. 


The video itself is incredibly loaded with bullshit with its automatic graphic mentioning of WW2 and the neo far right. A video that starts like that is almost always propaganda. Neither is exactly connected to the set of difficulties between Poland and EU. Nor are the immigration policies connected with ""culture"" or ""history"". They are just the consequence of the realities of modern labour market in the EU. The video tries to show all those factors and facts as some kind of single plot thread when it simply is not.

I am not Polish and I am very much against PiS, I am just pissed at publications like Vox that aren't up to the task of creating content on topics like that but still get plenty of viewership.

733,"&gt; I absolutely adore this country, and I adore half of its people. I must admit I dislike the other 50.1% racist imperialist lot that think they’re better than anybody else.

Hating half a country (51.9% actually) is ridiculous. We're one of the most accommodating, least racist countries in all of Europe. Your people are probably guilty of thinking they are better than most of the planet.

&gt;It might not cross people's mind, but it's deeply ingrained in their mentality (the 4 decades political agenda I was talking about in my previous post).

I don't believe it is. Obviously it will get a free pass here, but as soon as someone says *Germans have a deeply ingrained hatred of Jews in their mentality* everyone will lose their shit. Double standards. (Neither is true, if you were starting to wonder).

&gt;So losing 50% of your trades is not ""major"" according to you? Don't know what's your monthly payslip like mate, but 90% of people in this country (UK), wouldn't be able to make ends meet if their wage was halved.

Wages are not going to halve. Stagnation is pretty much the worst possible outcome. And it doesn't need to happen if the EU can be reasonable about things. It should do. After all job losses in the EU from a bad Brexit are thought to be three times higher than in the UK.

&gt;Free from what exactly? You do realise that Europe pre Europe was ravaged by war every other year, and now we can pride ourselves of the longest period of peace known to mankind? If what you guys mean is ""free to unleash war"", by all means, but that's the very definition of an imperial behaviour. Or being free to trade to whoever you want maybe? You mean being able to trade with Kiwis?Or Aussies maybe? or the whole African continent maybe? the 3 entities mentioned above combined don't make the GDP of Germany.

Free from being controlled by the EU, just as the EU is free from being controlled by the USA, for example. It's not hard to grasp. Independence is its own reward.

&gt;Ah, so ""not vetoing"" something that's been agreed by other 27 people is generosity now? To me it sounds very much like ""feel honoured that that by my Godly grace I'm allowing you to carry on""...sounds a bit like something an emperor would say?

It's literally how the EU works. It is generosity - we let you do something that we didn't want you to do. Of course it's generous.

&gt;No, but you will be destroyed by a no deal brexit.

Nah mate. We won't be destroyed. Leave the hyperbole behind please.

&gt;You won't even be allowed to fly over european territory if it ends with a no-deal, I'm sure you're aware of this?

Incorrect. The EU has signed the International Air Services Transit Agreement.

&gt;Nor drive, nor sail, nor trade with anyone in Europe.

All incorrect. You are extremely ill informed.

&gt;Independence wouldn't destroy you, but solitary confinement most definitely would, and so far this is what it looks like will happen.

My point is that what you're doing is equivalent to the following:

British guy, ""Man, those Nazi concentration camps look rough! We shouldn't do business with them!""

You, ""Gee, I wonder who put the treaty of Versailles upon them! What? Without that, Hitler wouldn't be in power!""

That's factually probably true (though we don't have a counter-factual in either case), but it's an odd thing to bring up. The overly harsh conditions may have been a necessary condition for the gruesome embrace of the NSDAP, but certainly not a sufficient one. It also took a lot of moral maliciousness on the part of the German people.

Equally, the Iranian people were in the right to remove the Shah, but those supporting the Ayatollah are to be blamed for the moral failings described above, not the Western powers. The Jews killed by the Nazis were not killed by Georges Clemenceau, and the gays killed in Iran not by the British and Americans.

Again, two things can be bad or evil at once. The Iranian state, supported by a large segment of its population, is a theocratic and deeply Islamic one. Their crimes are not the fault of imperialistic interventionists. Those are to be blamed for the subversion of democracy and brutal murders by the Shah.

There exists a secular, ""Westernized"" segment of the Iranian population whom I wish the best of luck. I support the Iran deal, fwiw.

957,"The Estonia disaster occurred on Wednesday, 28 September 1994, between about 00:55 and 01:50 (UTC+2) as the ship was crossing the Baltic Sea, en route from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm, Sweden. Estonia was on a scheduled crossing with departure at 19:00 on 27 September. She had been expected in Stockholm the next morning at about 09:30. She was carrying 989 people: 803 passengers and 186 crew.[11][JAIC 2] Most of the passengers were Scandinavian, while most of the crew members were Estonian (several Swedish passengers were of Estonian origin). The ship was fully loaded, and was listing slightly to starboard because of poor cargo distribution.[12]

According to the final disaster report, the weather was rough, with a wind of 15 to 20 metres per second (29 to 39 kn; 34 to 45 mph), force 7–8 on the Beaufort scale and a significant wave height of 4 to 6 metres (13 to 20 ft)[JAIC 3] compared with the highest measured significant wave height in the Baltic Sea of 7.7 metres (25.3 ft).[13] Esa Mäkelä, the captain of Silja Europa who was appointed on-scene commander for the subsequent rescue effort, described the weather as ""normally bad"", or like a typical autumn storm in the Baltic Sea. All scheduled passenger ferries were at sea. The official report says that while the exact speed at the time of the accident is not known, Estonia had very regular voyage times, averaging 16 to 17 knots (30 to 31 km/h; 18 to 20 mph). The chief mate of the Viking Line cruiseferry Mariella tracked Estonia's speed by radar at approximately 14.2 knots (26.3 km/h; 16.3 mph) before the first signs of distress, while the Silja Europa's officers estimated her speed at 14 to 15 knots (26 to 28 km/h; 16 to 17 mph) at midnight.

The first sign of trouble aboard Estonia was when a metallic bang was heard, caused by a heavy wave hitting the bow doors around 01:00, when the ship was on the outskirts of the Turku archipelago, but an inspection—limited to checking the indicator lights for the ramp and visor—showed no problems.[12] Over the next 10 minutes, similar noises were reported by passengers and other crew.[12] At about 01:15, the visor in which the ship's bow door opened separated, and the ship immediately took on a heavy starboard list (initial 30 to 40 degrees, but by 01:30, the ship had rolled 90 degrees) as water flooded into the vehicle deck.[12] Estonia was turned to port and slowed before her four engines cut out completely.[12]

At about 01:20 a weak female voice called ""Häire, häire, laeval on häire"", Estonian for ""Alarm, alarm, there is alarm on the ship"", over the public address system, which was followed immediately by an internal alarm for the crew, then one minute later by the general lifeboat alarm. The vessel's rapid list and the flooding prevented many people in the cabins from ascending to the boat deck.[12] A Mayday was communicated by the ship's crew at 01:22, but did not follow international formats. Estonia directed a call to Silja Europa and only after making contact with her did the radio operator utter the word ""Mayday"". In English, the radio operator on Silja Europa, chief mate Teijo Seppelin replied: ""Estonia, are you calling mayday?"" After that, the voice of third mate Andres Tammes took over on Estonia and the conversation shifted to Finnish.[14] Tammes was able to provide some details about their situation but due to loss of power, he could not give their position, which delayed rescue operations somewhat.

966,"Hehehe. To good an opening as to not to reply with a hyperbole.

&gt;First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving, which is unlikely. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let’s look at the different religions that exist in the world today.

&gt;Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle’s Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.

&gt;This gives two possibilities:

&gt;1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.

&gt;2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

&gt;So which is it?

&gt;If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, ‘It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,’ and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct….. …leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting ‘Oh my God.’

No, it isn't.

One the other hand, how do you propose to pervert an ideology based on a belief that individuals should be free and have certain inviolable fundamental rights? I am not saying you can't, but it is much, much, MUCH harder to do.

This was not a vote of no-confidence it was a vote if he should continue to be prime minister. This type of vote happens after each election unless the prime minister steps down before the vote. What makes this vote unique is the previous prime minster stepped down.

Also he will still be prime minister until the speaker has chosen a new prime minister. 

Edit: Fun fact this type vote is the first of a kind in Sweden since it was introduced under Reinfeldt and Reinfeldt stepped down instead of facing a vote in 2014. 

Edit 2: To explain things further what will happen now. Löfven will govern a caretaker government that will govern until the speaker of the riskdag chooses a new prime minster which could be Löfven or any other person. This is a difference from a vote of no confidence since if a vote of no confidence was carried out he would be instantly ousted from power and not leading a caretaker government.

There's a culture in the UK of feeling seperate from the Europe that goes deep into our history, prior to WW1/2 we largely traded with our colonies and kept out of European affairs. We were even denied admission to the EEC initially which made us less engrained in the EU community and contributed to that feeling. It hasn't been said much but for the past 2 decades, it's been shouted at residents here that we're becoming too overpopulated - particularly in England. It's something that I've also personally heard from many many people. It's a huge part of the immigration debate in the UK and when people hear that by 2050 we'll be the biggest country in the EU (by population), this creates negative images of poverty and unsustainability. Brexit wasn't 51% of people voting because they dislike refugees or foreigners, that demographic is far too small to push them over to the majority. And although there is a real demographic of racists as anywhere else, it's not that large and the far-right/anti-EU parties haven't had the success here as those in the rest of Europe.

1186,"&gt; B-but that wasn't le REAL™ communism!!!!

I have a question about this. I have asked it before but no-one seems able to give me a straight answer. Maybe you're more enlightened. Anyway, here it goes.

Words have definitions, especially political ideologies. It's why we don't call every right-wing government fascist or why we don't take Congo's ""democratic Republic"" claim very seriously. So, why does this go out of the window as soon as socialists/communists get into power? The USSR didn't even call itself communist, it called itself socialist. But like I just said, calling yourself something and actually being something isn't the same. I can call myself the King of the UK but that doesn't make it so.

Whilst I am at it, I have another question you may be able to answer. How is it possible that ""left unity"" is the biggest meme in left-wing circles, because the left is completely fractured without reconciling anytime soon, but somehow according to right-wingers every communist agrees that Stalinism and the USSR were 100% good?

As the ice melted, the land started floating back up again. This is still going on.  
Some places where the ice was thick are rising at a level of centimeters per year - faster than even the worst case scenarios of sea level rise.  
In other places, like around the edges of the ice sheets, the land is instead subsiding, making sea level rise even worse.

So a map like this one, where someone just takes an elevation map and changes the sea level value, is worse than useless - because it shows a world that can never be. It ignores the fact that it will take hundreds of years for the ice to melt, during which time the land itself will rise and sink, completely changing the the coastline.",,/r/europe/comments/9igpta/what_europe_would_look_like_if_all_the_ice_melted/e6ljj5f/,Baud_Olofsson,1537859250

&gt; Every time we witness an injustice and do not act, we train our character to be passive in its presence and thereby eventually lose all ability to defend ourselves and those we love.

-- Julian Assange

&gt; the world is not a kind place

Oh? So how do people get older than even one day? Do they feed themselves, or what?

&gt; I could be compassionate all I want and open my house to the homeless, but would it also not be my fault if I come back and all my stuff is gone?

Here goes the black and white thinking again. Maybe for *you* it's either all or nothing, either you don't even give the homeless a friendly nod, OR you open up your house to ""the"" homeless, like, all of them at once, and then leave the house. But that's nothing I said. I say ""compassion"", you say ""oh, so you mean opening up my house to the homeless"". It's pointless.

If it has to be extremes, why not go the other way, why not exploit and steal and kill wherever you can, before ""the world"" does it to you? It's not a kind place, so if you don't get them first, they'll get you! Why are you on reddit when you could be stealing money from blind beggars?

&gt; [Humans] have been genetically programmed through hunting behavior: cooperation and sharing. Cooperation between members of the same band was a practical necessity for most hunting societies; so was the sharing of food. Since meat is perishable in most climates except that of the Arctic, it could not be preserved. Luck in hunting was not equally divided among all hunters; hence the practical outcome was that those who had luck today would share their food with those who would be lucky tomorrow. Assuming hunting behavior led to genetic changes, the conclusion would be that modern man has an innate impulse for cooperation and sharing, rather than for killing and cruelty.

WikiLeaks released the State Department cables in 2010, revealing that appeasing Russia was a motivator for canceling the plan with Poland.

1371,"In English, it used to be called Bohemia. In the Czech language, they use variations of the same word to refer to Czechia and what we call 'Bohemia' in modern English.

In Czech, the country 'Czechia' is called *Česko* whereas the region 'Bohemia' is called *Čechy*. Both *Česko* and *Čechy* are both just variations of the same word and were historically synonymous.

In English, historically 'Czechia' was historically called *Bohemia* whereas the modern region of 'Bohemia' was called *Bohemia proper*. Nowadays, the region is called *Czechia proper* sometimes (in addition to *Bohemia*).

The modern name *Czech(ia)* came from Polish and replaced the already existing name for the entire country (Bohemia).

So basically, Czech = Bohemian. I don't know exactly why the region and country are given completely distinct names in Germanic languages. They're even given distinct names in German (Germans neighbor them). I have heard before that Germans tried to divide Bohemians/Czechs into Bohemians proper and Moravians so they promoted separate names for the country and people so that the Moravians would feel less Czech/Bohemian, but I don't have much info on that part.

Also, a fun fact regarding the name Bohemian. It comes from the Celtic tribe *Boii* (*Boii* is their Latin name). The Bavarians also get their name from the same tribe. This tribe also traveled to Eastern Europe. Strabo blames Thracian king Burebista for their extinction since he traveled to fight them (as well as other tribes) several times.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9ijj31/poland_becomes_first_country_from_former_soviet/e6lc3o9/,UnbiasedPashtun,1537847893

1380,"&gt; It was super weird that Czechia itself had to ""change its name"" in English; it was more that English speakers for some reason opted for ""The Czech Republic"" instead o the logical choice of ""Czechia""; how do Czechs get to decide the English name for something? Can the Netherlands henceforth decide that ""Dutch"" is a stupid word and decree that the English should use ""Netherlandish"" instead because it makes more sense?

Technically yes, but they have no reason to. Thailand's English name used to be *Siam* but then they had it changed to *Thailand* (the native Thai name is *Pratheṣ̄thiy*). Siam was never the country's actual name but just called that in English. In reality (if I'm not mistaken), Siam was to Thailand what the Porte was to the Ottoman Empire.

There is also another example. Persia had its official name changed to *Iran* in English while it always kept the same name in Persian.

PS: You guys should try to have Dutch replaced with Netherlandish. It makes so much more sense and would clear up the historical confusion regarding the word (the word Dutch referred to Germans as well before).",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9ijj31/poland_becomes_first_country_from_former_soviet/e6lcerg/,UnbiasedPashtun,1537848263

1477,"This is **by no means** an exhaustive list.

The CIA attempted to assassinate Fidel Castro over 600 times.

The US supported a coup to overthrow the world’s first democratically elected Socialist leader Salvador Allende on September 11 1973. They replaced him with General Augusto Pinochet, a brutal dictator whose reputation hopefully precedes him and whose actions were supported and sanctioned by the US. Considering the long history of violent suppression of Socialist movements in Latin America, it’s no surprise Venezuela is where it is at and Cuba was a dictatorship (Castro was extremely paranoid, all things considered). Though American propagandists like to complain the issue is Marxism and not their foreign policy destroying political systems.

The US supported the coup which overthrew the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, opting for Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, yet another brutal dictator who has violently suppressed political dissent and is responsible for human rights violations (American politicians may condemn him in 150 years). 

The US also opposed the election of democratically elected Hamas in Gaza and have backed attempts to overthrow them, despite Hamas being initially propped up by Israel to undermine leftist secular Palestinian organisations PLO and Fatah. They also supported the assassination of Yasser Arafat, the leader of Fatah.

The US and UK also overthrew the pro-democracy leader Mohammad Mosaddegh, in favour of an oppressive rule under the Shah to prevent Iranian oil being nationalised.

The US also led the illegal invasion of Iraq killing its pro-US dictator Saddam Hussein, whose human rights violations they approved of, before his overthrow suited their interests. The result of that invasion does not need to be said. They also tried (and failed) to overthrow the Taliban in Afghanistan; though the Soviets also were very fond of Afghanistan as well. The result there was similar to Iraq in that “many” civilians were killed needlessly and human rights were violated severely.

I have only mentioned “democratically elected” where appropriate because many people think that gives a leader magic points. When in reality, hostile invasions and government overthrows of any foreign political system is illegal under international law. 

In my opinion, it is an easy to defend opinion that the US has been far more destabilising than the Russian government.

But as you said, this is a tangent to the issue of social media. That issue concerns us because it directly affects our use of the internet. Though the US has had little need to weaponise social media, the Israeli government have been known to run propaganda campaigns known as Hasbara on social media. If one is concerned about government propaganda, one needs to know where to look for it to know how to avoid it. If you think the only medium is social media, you would be forgiven for thinking the main meddler is Russia.",,/r/europe/comments/9ig9p8/ive_seen_all_your_nazi_stuff_here_is_a_mug_my/e6l302j/,AnotherAlire,1537839051

In other words, you might argue, ""Too bad, you agreed on the decision making process, now you can't just ignore it!"" They might respond with, ""So what? We agreed to that process in junction with the weak enforcement that we now choose to ignore!"" To which your counter would be, ""That's not a how this works! There was a reasonable expectation of honoring contracts, whether or not that's technically enforcable! Acting like this is defying the spirit of the agreement!"" And to that, in turn, they could say, ""And forcing us to take in refugees is also completely against the spirit of our initial agreement, even if it's de jure possible to force us, legally.""

Because that appears to be pretty much where we're at, and the respective positions. At the end of the day, the EU as a whole will have to decide if it's worth it from their perspective to force through legally sound laws, if they have to use all their power to do so. That might very well threaten the project.

1541,"&gt; How is that imperialistic? It couldn't be done differently because no one else wanted their statehood. If we left them by themselves they'd get swallowed by the Soviet Union. The West didn't give a shit about them.

Why not creating Commonwealth of Poland and Ruthenia then? Instead you occupied and oppressed non-Polish people with intentions of polonizing the non Polish regions, that is imperialism in my book.

&gt;Not exactly true. A union would have taken place, not an outright annexation.

Yeah right, a union, just like Lithuania ""joined"" USSR and was totally in control.

&gt;The fact that Lithuania ruled by nationalists was openly hostile to Poland

And Poland was ruled by Polish nationalists who were openly hostile to Lithuanian statehood, after all who do you think spewed most shit that we're German/Soviet puppet.

&gt;After all, no matter how painful it may be for you guys to admit, the Vilnius region, at that time, was way more Polish than Lithuanian

It was fully Polish, I do not deny it, but it was never part of Poland. 

Maybe we should carve up Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany should definitely annex Austria, Russia does the right thing in Ukraine, they did exactly what Poland did /s

&gt;it's impossible for any country to simply give a chunk of their population out in order to not hurt some other nation historical feelings.

You would realize that having huge Polish population in Lithuania would definitely made it more pro-Polish in the long run? The mutual enmity was created due to Suwalki and Vilnius region dispute, without it there wouldn't exist a mutual enmity. After all first Polish president's brother sided with Lithuania and was one of the signatories of act of independence of Lithuania. You took the dumbest way to approach Lithuania.

*In regards to the future of Lithuania, the Conference announced that an independent state, based on democratic principles, needed to be declared.[4] In response to various schemes to re-create the old Grand Duchy of Lithuania or Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the new state was to be created only in the lands, that were assumed to be ethnically Lithuanian.[7] Lacking real powers to represent the nation (the Conference was not democratically elected by the citizens), it did not specify the foundations of the state or relationships with other countries. These were to be decided by the Constituent Assembly, elected by popular vote.[4] These three principles were echoed by the Council of Lithuania when it declared the Act of Independence of Lithuania.*

*The national minorities were promised freedom for their cultural needs.[10] In later years national minorities were granted the same rights as Lithuanians and in some cases extra representation in the government: after the war ended, the Council of Lithuania was expanded to include Jewish and Belarusian representatives;[11] the first governments of Lithuania included Ministries for Jewish and Belarusian affairs;[12] in 1920 the Jewish community was granted national and cultural autonomy with the right to legislate binding ordinances;[13] the Russian Orthodox Church received financial support from the government;[13] Germans, concentrated in the disputed Klaipėda Region, were also granted autonomy.[13] The only sizeable group that did not have extra representation was the Polish minority because of intense conflicts over the Vilnius Region*

Also talking about national feelings, isn't Poland the one that was kept by the PLC past more than anybody? You know more about getting hurt in historical feelings.

&gt;It boggles my mind that it is so hard for Lithuanians to understand.

You have your side view.

&gt;Yeah, well, as bad as it sounds, it's not like Lithuanian hardcore nationalists who were in charge, were in mood for any kind of compromise or appeasement on anything, they even rejected plebiscites for crying out loud.

Of course they rejected it. It was clear as day that Poles would not join Lithuanian cause.

&gt;Lithuanians weren't exactly pro-Polish either, so such actions were mutual.

There were pro-Polish people, like General Silvestras Zukauskas, who defended Lithuania from Soviet invasion with Lithuanian and Saxon (German) volunteers during Lithuanian-Soviet war.

&gt;Hell, aren't you to this day changing names of Polish people to sound Lithuanian?

1598,"I am honest enough to admit that you have made some excellent points.  The core pillars of the enlightenment are what makes Europe the shinning beacon of hope and freedom for the world. The modern world is in the image of those European values , not the Chinese , not the Egyptian , not the Arab or any other great people. 
We should take pride in that. 

However , I feel that there also are pillars of religion and culture that uphold our societies and that enable enlightenment. I admit that it scares me , the thought of accepting everything as equal, to accept ,for instance, Islam as equal to modern Christianity despite Islam clearly being the far more backward and barbaric religion.  Or accepting other culture as equal despite them not being so, ofc there are certain things other cultures have that we can learn from. Many are simply inferior. Some would say I am not sensitive and that it’s not politically correct to say such a thing but I think it’s important for us to tell the truth as we see it. The problem of taking some of the ideas of enlightenment to an extreme , to open the gates for all thought to be equal is dangerous.  Notice how in England there are now introducing separate sharia courts for marriages in Muslim communities. 
France and Europe was far more homogeneous back then and without us leaning into the foreign immigrants and insisting on them assimilating properly I fear that we might all wake up to countries where we wouldn’t want to live.  

Transgenderism to me seems to be a mental disorder , some rather accept that the body is at fault rather the the persons mind. Feelings and wishful thinking does not change reality. Why is there a push for the public to accept delusions?. To me the thought of everything goes is insanity, what about reality? Is there no such thing as objective reality. 

Regarding marriage as a sacred institution , what beside culture and tradition should determine its borders? In japan they can marry a pillow or a game character. Utter insanity, while  it might seem harmless at first I think it’s a negative for mankind as a whole. Accepting degeneracy only opens the pit of chaos further , it allows for further steps down a most dark and horrible path.  

Humans need rules to guide them and fear to hold them in place. Freedom as some describe it is in fact nothing more than an excuse to practice self-indulgence and at times taken to an satanic extreme. ",,/r/europe/comments/9ijcyi/one_of_these_things_is_not_like_the_other/e6kttuu/,xMoac,1537830495

1608,"&gt; Poland has imperialistic ambitions on restoring PLC. Even if independent Belarus or Ukraine would been created it would still would have ended up under Polish aegis.

How is that imperialistic? It couldn't be done differently because no one else wanted their statehood. If we left them by themselves they'd get swallowed by the Soviet Union. The West didn't give a shit about them.

&gt; After all Poland unsuccessfully attempted coup d'tat in Lithuania to install pro-Polish government that would agree in Polish annexation of Lithuania.

Not exactly true. A union would have taken place, not an outright annexation. The fact that Lithuania ruled by nationalists was openly hostile to Poland and wouldn't give up claims to Vilnius explains the motivation better than simple imperialism. After all, no matter how painful it may be for you guys to admit, the Vilnius region, at that time, was way more Polish than Lithuanian, and it's impossible for any country to simply give a chunk of their population out in order to not hurt some other nation historical feelings. It boggles my mind that it is so hard for Lithuanians to understand.

&gt; Polonization was already happening during first days of your independence.

Where? In the first days of the independence the territories with non-Polish minorities were mostly not under Polish control yet. Anyway, I'm gonna have to ask for a source on that.

&gt; Suwalki dispute:

&gt; After the uprising, Poland repressed Lithuanian cultural life in Sejny. Lithuanian schools in Sejny (which had some 300 pupils) and surrounding villages were closed.[11] The local Lithuanian clergy were evicted, and the Sejny Priest Seminary relocated.[6] According to Lithuanians, the repressions were even more far-reaching, including a ban on public use of the Lithuanian language and the closing of Lithuanian organizations, which had a total of 1,300 members.[11][28] The New York Times, reporting on renewed hostilities a year later, described the 1919 Sejny events as a violent occupation by the Poles, in which the Lithuanian inhabitants, teachers, and religious ministers were maltreated and expelled.

&gt; Let's not even begin with Vilnius region where Lithuanian cultural activists were facing death punishments, League of Nations had to interfere.

Yeah, well, as bad as it sounds, it's not like Lithuanian hardcore nationalists who were in charge, were in mood for any kind of compromise or appeasement on anything, they even rejected plebiscites for crying out loud. So it was either agree on anything the Lithuanians demand or resort to hostilities. Again, it doesn't justify mistreatment of civilians, but lets be frank here, Lithuanians weren't exactly pro-Polish either, so such actions were mutual.

1641,"Isn't this a bit of a simplistic statement?  I get your point but the reality is a bit more nuanced.

If you have a look at the actual statistics the total refugee plus asylum seeker population per capita of the countries you mention, seems to be similar or even higher than the reception/transit countries. I have analyzed annex table 1 of this UNHCR report stating the refugee population at the end of 2017 and made a simple calculation ([http://www.unhcr.org/5b27be547.pdf](http://www.unhcr.org/5b27be547.pdf)):

**Country		- Refugee/asylum seeker population	- Total population - Percentage refugees**

Denmark	47,927					5,745,547 		**0,83%**

France		401,729					67,320,000 		**0,60%**

Netherlands	111,629					17,255,408 		**0,65%**

Italy		354,698					60,494,118 		**0,59%**

Spain		54,028					46,788,820 		**0,12%**

Greece		83,418					10,816,286 		**0,77%**

Germany	1,413,127 				83,290,300 		**1,70%**

Sweden		327,709					10,201,988 		**3,21%**

&amp;#x200B;

Consider that the major economic cost is the permanent settlement of refugees (housing, health care, allowances etc. for many years). Therefore you could argue more solidarity for Germany and Sweden would be desirable but not necessarily for the Mediterranean countries.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, I agree with you the capabilities and funding of Frontex to guard the EU outer borders should be increased. However, it is questionable if this would reduce the amount of arriving refugees.

No persecution or discrimination regarding religion can legally take place here, which is great. 

Now, as for the hammer and sickle -- that is not a religious symbol. It's a symbol of a reprehensible ideology and its execution, which, remember, led to Lithuania getting occupied by Russia for decades (and many million dead, but that's another discussion).

Indeed I did that strange dance with people a few times working to feel out how someone might have voted and whether they were 'on side' or not..  

Funniest moment for me however was giving a talk near Sunderland to a group of people, mostly around 18-25 after the referendum and touching on that subject. I said something like 'given that around three in ten young people voted leave, it is entirely possible that someone you speak to every day, someone in your social circle, etc.. voted leave' the reaction was almost as though I'd suggested that they knew someone in ISIS, or that they'd be able to simply 'tell' if a person had voted leave because obviously they'd be utterly vile in every other way too.

1775,"&gt; Well we never stopped claiming Vilnius region, even after Polish ultimatum. Though we did preferred peace over war that's why we refused Nazi suggestion a German–Lithuanian military alliance against Poland and a promise to return Vilnius region. As much as we had enmity for Poland (and Poland in return) we saved some parts of Poland from Nazi/Soviet regime at least for a year, also we took many Polish civilian and military refugees during that time.

Don't get me wrong, I know that part of history fairly well and claiming that there was nothing wrong with taking Vilnius or Zaolzie the way it was taken is the last thing I want to do. But when I see people make a false equivalence with what happened later to Poland by the hands of Nazis and Soviets, it angers me. It's disingenuous, unfair and downright insulting.

&gt; I'm not going to play on ethnic card game, since we were Germanized in the West, and Polonized in the East, only the middle of Lithuania Core was still intact with it's identity. But neither should you, given how many other nationalities you had occupied.

Do you think that Ukraine and Belarus, which has had large Polish minorities, should have been given to the Soviet Union?

1778,"&gt;And your earlier point was that invasion of 1938 happened before invasion of 1919 which made the invasion of 1919 OK.

&gt;Sounds stupid? You wrote it.

Lmao, whatever rolls in your head.

&gt;Then so should Klaipeda, it had more Germans than Lithuanians

Probably true since Germans made a bit more than 40% of total population while the rest was evenly split between Lithuanians and so called Memellanders that were occasionally Prussian Lithuanians aka Lietuvininkai who spoke Lithuanian with some German loanwords while confessing Lutheranism instead of Catholism who preferred integrating Lithuania into German Empire.

&gt;If Poland had zero claim on Gdańsk while owning the city for longer than Lithuania owned Vilnius and having more Poles in Gdańsk than there were Lithuanians in Vilnius then by all metrics Lithuania had absolutely no claim on Vilnius. Unless you factor magic and unicorns in.

I didn't said you had 0 claims on the city, I said you had only historical claim on Danzig as much as  we had only historical claim on Vilnius. If you gonna argue that Danzig should have been part of Poland then you clearly accepting the fact that Vilnius should have been part of Lithuania, otherwise is just double standards.

&gt;Yes, you just linked to census of entire Vilnius voivodeship instead of just city. Again. Thank you for proving my point.

You do realize the census I gave on Danzig also included surrounding places?

&gt; Bruto modaal inkomen
Vanaf 2013 is het modale inkomen het meest voorkomende inkomen. Het wordt berekend als 79% van
het gemiddelde inkomen per arbeidsjaar, waarbij de 79% bepaald is met een historische cijferreeks.
Tot en met 2012 is het een bruto inkomen net onder de maximumpremie-inkomensgrens van de
Zorgverzekeringswet (Zvw). Voor 2012 is de maximumpremie-inkomensgrens aangehouden zoals die
gold bij het CEP2011 toen de premie-inkomensgrens Zvw nog niet was verhoogd naar de maximumpremie-inkomensgrens

1848,"&gt;Which is your interpretation

Sadly since we have an official ruling of the Constitutional Tribunal stating that current Tribunal is illegal there is no one in Poland to legally and officially decide on this matter.

My interpretation is the same as the interpretation of the polish universities, lawyers self ruling bodies, The European Commision, judges of the ENCJ, The Venice Commission and basically 99% of all experts dealing with this subject. The situation is the same as in case of antivaxxers or flat earthers. The matter is not controversial at all. 

&gt;That is the only legal way of dealing with internal issues like that.

I completely disagree. ECJ is the only legal way of dealing with that since Poland is in the UE and accepted ECJ power over polish law in this regard (article 19 of the treaties) and do not have a legal body to decide it internally. 

If Poland want's to be in the EU it must comply with its rules it is very simple. If you would have a roommate that signed a contract with you and others that you all will not smoke inside, but he just ignores this rule for over 3 years now, would you really think that trying to enforce this rule is an attack on his personal freedoms? He can smoke all he want, he just must change his apartment first.

1874,"&gt;Czechs did exactly what Poles were doing.

You got it the other way around, Poland did what Czechs did to them first.

&gt;According to my logic, Poland was ambitions imperialistic state with aggressive foreign policy.

Yeah, it was. But you are also a hypocrite as you pull the demographics card only when it's convenient for you but when countered you change the topic.

&gt;I'm not denying the fact that Vilnius was polonized, but it still breached agreement.

And Zaolzie was Czechified after 1919 which makes your argument with 1930 and 1939 demographics of Zaolzie as stupid as my satirical argument about Vilnius 1931 demographics.

I'll repeat that once again, your argument was as good as a literal joke. Not even insulting you, just stating facts.

&gt;Half of Poland was filled with Belarusians and Ukrainians...

We could have even more after Polish-Soviet war, the government just wanted to take only lands with a lot of Poles. [We gave plenty of land back to the Soviets](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Ofensywa_na_Warszawe.png/1280px-Ofensywa_na_Warszawe.png). (Green line is the front at the end of the war)

&gt;And you're complaining about small, ethnically mixed but important territory while annexing just like that by yourself, while also spewing claims on Danzig and even Klaipeda region, it's pretty double standards to me.

The same Klaipeda region that was supposed to be a Free City but Lithuania just took it with force? Despite the fact it was only 26-27% Lithuanian? 

Listen, I don't deny claiming Klaipeda was stupid from Polish government, but Poland had as good a claim for Gdańsk as Lithuania did for Vilnius. 

Hell, Polish claim was even better as the city was Polish longer than Vilnius was Lithuanian and there were more Poles in Gdańsk than there were Lithuanians in Vilnius.

&gt; Italy’s populist government on Monday escalated its clampdown on irregular immigration with a decree aimed at **slashing the number of people awarded asylum and doubling the time irregular migrants can be detained**. 

&gt; Such a move could fall foul of the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention, which is intended to protect all refugees, whether formally recognised or not, from being forcibly returned, except where they are a danger to public safety or national security. 
Before the government approved the draft decree, a source in President Sergio Mattarella’s office had said **parts of it might be unconstitutional - which could open the way for Mattarella to block it**. 

Let's hope the president does his constitutional duty and blocks the creeping authoritarianism. We've already seen such dangerous lurches in the V4. Italy must prove it has more in common with Western Europe rather than with Poland or Hungary.

&gt; The head of the Italian Catholic bishops’ conference, Nunzio Galantino, on Sunday criticised the decision to link immigration and security in the same piece of legislation, saying: 

&gt; “We cannot consider the immigrant’s condition to be automatically that of a criminal.”

Which brings up a very interesting point.  I — and, I assume, others — had assumed that there would be some sort of decision made on EU judicial authority.

One possible route would be ""court cases on UK issues *must* be filed prior to Brexit, and if you miss that cutoff, you're out-of-luck"".

A less-abrupt approach might have been the UK retaining input on judicial matters for a transition period, not being bound by laws passed during the transition period, but having to honor suits filed during the transition period.

Or maybe only cases that had been *ruled* on prior to Brexit would have effect.

But…right now, everything is up in the air and could very easily evaporate in no-deal.

It's not doing badly though is it.

2090,"&gt;My argument was that the only nations that are truly safe are the ones that have their own working nuclear arsenal. 

I disagree.

Even if you question NATO's willingness to engage in a nuclear exchange over minor allies, the fact remains that NATO countries are still safe.

For the very same reasons that NATO is not going to launch a nuclear attack on Russia (MAD) - Russia is not going to launch a nuclear attack on NATO.

What remains is a conventional Russian attack, which would be suicidal, because NATO is about 10 times more powerful than Russia in conventional terms.

Therefore Russia needs nuclear weapons to be safe from the much more powerful NATO, but NATO does not need to use nuclear weapons to be safe from the much weaker Russia.

This is all reflected in the Russian nuclear doctrine, which moved away from ""no first use"" (a natural stance when you dominate conventionally) and towards ""first use if the survival of the state is threatened"" (a natural stance when you expect to lose a conventional conflict).",Montenegro,/r/europe/comments/9i7agt/no_one_pushes_russia_around/e6jnfiy/,Glideer,1537793553

However, sometimes it's just *so much cheaper* to go with a car (like 3+ people travelling half way across the country) that not going by car makes no sense. Also sometimes the time save is enough to justify going with a car (or a bike). For my summer job I cycled 30 minutes to and from work (would have been some 10 minutes by car) but with a bus I'd have to use about 60-90 minutes each way, depending on the shift, since the busses only go that way once an hour.

Cycling in Finland doesn't really work outside of late spring, summer, and early fall though (for longer distances), so I have to use busses for travels like that.

Then he asked the Poles to let the Allies (which as I said he already secrectly convinced to grant the region to Czechs) decide who Zaolzie should go to instead of plebiscite that was planned.

Then the Czechs denied military access to Hungarians that wanted to help us in Polish-Soviet war. 

I can understand that one as they had a war with Hungary earlier, but then they shouldn't really complain that we didn't let Soviets pass to Czechoslovakia, that was the very same situation.

It's hard to betray your enemy, and Poland in 1938 certainly viewed Czechoslovakia as one.

The worst part about it tho is drunk Germans. Two of them all but assaulted my mom and sister. They approached a tried to kiss them in the cheecks and my sister even obliged and tried leace but then he proceeded to grope her and try to force a kiss on the lips while she was screeming ""No! No!"". I had to run over and separate him forcefully. All the meawhile the police was walking buy and didnt care to help my screaming sister. But they did care to chastise me for dragging that guy away from my sister. Probably because we werent speaking german but english (we are polish). Nationalistic cunts! Not the last time the german police plays a villain in my post too.

Next is being trampled by giant, fat, drunk Germans. I'm sorry to have to mention fat but it's true. Large-postured drunk Germans completely don't care to look where they go. I've been rammed into a bunch of times, the last time was in entrance to a subway starion. A huge german lady pinned me to a wall with her body while forcing her way through a crowd completely disregarding that all of the people around want to get into the station, not just her. Again a policeman was no further than 2 meters away and didnt even react to her clearly acting like the worst jerk. At this point i lost my temper, caught up to her, stopped her and tried to get her to notice the world around while she barges through the crowd. I was completely peaceful and didn't even touch her but another big, drunk German who was apparently her partner just went straight to trying to punch me. He half missed half I caught his hand and what happened? Of course the policeman was having problems with me again, letting that guy go without even a word to him. Then on that same subway station another drunk German rammed into my mom knocking her on the floor and hitting her breast so hard she was rolling in pain. He stumbled around for a moment but seemingly didnt even notice my mother. Again there was lots of police and munich security all around who must have noticed the incident but pretended they did not.

Some of the police even smoke on service and one blew a puff of smoke into my face. I looked into his eyes and just got a smirk in return like he was proud of himself. Speaking of tobaco smoke. The whole place is full of it. Germans wont even stop themselves from smoking while walking in a very tight crowd which is a hazard of burning and it's just disgusting to breathe that.

Overall I give Oktoberfest a strong 2/10. Maybe it was just me getting unlucky but really, Germans.  Control yourself a tiny bit.
I am fully aware that the vast majority of people attenting are very fine people who wouldnt do anything i just described. Sadly its the bad stuff that you notice :/ That disclaimed doesnt apply to German police on the event - right now my opinion is that they are just the worst and should face punishment for gross negligance of theie duties (and being nationalistic cunts).",,/r/europe/comments/9ic2he/in_pictures_germanys_oktoberfest_opens/e6jc0h2/,Barsolar,1537771725

2398,"&gt; what I'm arguing for is the rule of law and the honoring of commitments made, not the relocation of the whole of the middle east and North Africa.

The problem here is many fold.

1. mandatory quotas do not work. By the way, Hungary did take its share of asylum seekers who *crossed its borders and filed the paperwork*.

2. the EU was supposed to be an economic entity, not an ""ever increasing federation"". Nobody mentioned forcing member states to  accept population engineering. (Don't give me the 'it's only a few migrants' talk. It is NOT a solution to the problem, despite of the fact that it is being touted as such.)

3. The V4 countries (and Orban especially) had alternative solutions as early as 2015. They were brushed off the table, and he was called a racist and a Nazi for them. These solutions included increased border protection, helping refugees closer to their homes, and weeding out the economic migrants (about 60-80% of the people coming, depending on which estimate you believe.) Come 2018 and suddenly everyone is talking the same talk.

4. During 2015 Hungary was essentially struggling alone with the inflow of 600 000 people, with only recriminations coming from the West when they asked for Dublin III to be suspended. It seemed ""Europe"" was content of letting it become a migrant holding pen, just like Greece and Italy were. After this show of solidarity and all I don't think you can expect too much sympathy for the attempts of redistribution. In this one thing I agree with Orban. 

5. Even though the cries of horror about fences and transit zones, **to this day nobody actually managed to give a response to the question: how else are you going to make sure no unsavoury elements enter and then just disappear in the EU**? Who do you think is going to be blamed if (or when) the next terrorist turns out to be a person who entered through Hungary, but was let free because *we can't detain people until we establish their identity*?


6. About rules: maintaining internal borders is against Schengen rules -and the mirriad little hyporisies people already pointed out when it comes to managing migrants.

Youre right. It has been established that Net capital flows In the Eurozone are from the perifery to the core. Which is why Greece happened and is bound to happen again. The EU funds are nowhere high enough to counter that, hence the talks (championed by France. Opposed by Germany) about Eurozone fiscal compact.

Also it's the reason perifery countries with their own monetary system fare much better (Poland, Hungary) as they kept the monetary tools to counter the outgoing capital flow.

2422,"[Marx on how to deal with counter protesters to the dictatorship of the proletariat:](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/11/06.htm)

&gt;the very cannibalism of the counterrevolution will convince the nations that there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror.

and further:

&gt;We have no compassion and we ask no compassion from you. When our turn comes, we shall not make excuses for the terror.

He would have not objected to using violence to achieve socialism, nor in using terror as means to fight the counter-revolutionaries, to achieve the end goal of communism. To say he opposed violence is absurd.

[Marx on the Jewish Question:](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/index.htm)

&gt;How is an opposition resolved? By making it impossible. How is religious opposition made impossible? By abolishing religion. As soon as Jew and Christian recognize that their respective religions are no more than different stages in the development of the human mind, different snake skins cast off by history

Marx was utterly unconcerned about individual self-fulfillment or any such notions. Individuals are vehicles of the collective, first and foremost. If something like relgion stood in the way of the communist goal, it had to be crushed. [And in the Manifesto he wrote:](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch04.htm)

&gt;The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.

But don't just read the Communist Manifesto, btw. That was specifically written as a short... well substitute ""propaganda work"" for a less biased term if you wish. You can read ""German Ideology"" and other of his works to see that both Marx and Engels definitely had absolutely no problem with a violent revolution or terror. It's not like he *desired* those, in a sadistic manner (that we can tell), either. He saw it as a purely prudential thing. If violence and terror are necessary to keep socialists in power and further the communist goal, it ought to be done. (I say ""ought to"" and want to preemptively say that, yes, Marx was a materialist and stated morality didn't exist... you can believe his theories were purely descriptive and scientific if you choose so...) In their [address to the central committee to the communist league](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm) Marx and Engels write:

&gt;Above all, during and immediately after the struggle the workers, as far as it is at all possible, must oppose bourgeois attempts at pacification and force the democrats to carry out their terroristic phrases. They must work to ensure that the immediate revolutionary excitement is not suddenly suppressed after the victory. On the contrary, it must be sustained as long as possible. Far from opposing the so-called excesses—instances of popular vengeance against hated individuals or against public buildings with which hateful memories are associated—the workers’ party must not only tolerate these actions but must even give them direction.

I find it completely unbelievable that Marx would have opposed the spirit of either Stalin or Mao. The specific actions, sure, maybe. Some of which Mao did was out-right idiotic, and the Holodomor was as well (unless they actually intentionally killed those Ukranians to prevent nationalistic uprisings, in which case he may have been able to be convinced). This contemporary indulgence towards Marx is hard to explain. The actions of those communist revolutionaries didn't all come out of the blue. They can be supported by Marx' writings, for the most part.

And that goes for the very rejection of the liberal notion of reason and democracy itself. Democracy might be used as a tool, but to see the world as one where autonomous individuals elect a set of ideas as their guiding principles, based on reason, is thoroughly rejected by Marx. Consciousness is first and foremost **social.** And thus set and determined by one's class. There was never a way for Marx to believe the ballot box would allow for socialism to come about, realistically. At least not without subversive tactics. Marx quite literally believed convincing people through argument was a ridiculous prospect.

And that's where all those brain-washing measures in the Soviet Union originate from. All the propaganda. The spying on each other, the re-education, the language redefinitions, the art, the architecture, the gulags. Marx didn't lay out a blue print for how to achieve socialism or communism (because he basically believed it would inevitably happen in the industralized countries anyways, and that's sooner rather than later). But all these things mentioned before are very much derivative of his ideas.

Marx and Engels conveniently shield themselves from criticism when they ""predict"" the future, rather than advocate for what happens. Such as in [this quote from Engels:](https://www.marxistsfr.org/archive/marx/works/1849/01/13.htm)

&gt;The next world war will result in the disappearance from the face of the earth not only of reactionary classes and dynasties, but also of entire reactionary peoples. And that, too, is a step forward.

You should be able to see quite clearly how a committed communist can read this as, ""I may murder and purge the reactionaries in my just war to bring about communism,"" rather easily.

2480,"That's very much anachronistic. In WW2, both the Nazis and the Soviets were ""bad."" Without a question. Plenty of countries in Eastern Europe got invaded and saw their populations subjugated, raped, and/or murdered by one of them first, and the other afterwards (and with some bad luck it moved back and forth some more). But what makes the Nazis seem so horrific is not so much their expansionist militarism. If that were the case, people would view Napoleon as just as bad as (if not worse than) Hitler. It was their ""domestic"" (whatever expanding land they considered domestic) murders and the vile nature of their ideology.

The Soviets extended their horror-regime's sphere of influence from Erfurt to Pyongyang to Cuba following WW2. They and other socialist governments killed ten times the amount of their own people as the Nazis did. Though, admittedly, over a larger population and time period, as you mentioned. They didn't kill on racial grounds, but on on class-based grounds, and to defend the revolution against ""reactionary"" counter-revolutionaries. Is that really any better? It's not as if the typical person shot or sent to the gulag had a fair trial. But either way, defending your property is not an evil act. Being murdered or sent to die in a labor camp because of it is evil, on the other hand. That's no better a justification for murder than ""lack of racial purity."" They are both despicable acts by adherents to despicable ideologies.

&gt;depending on leader some communists were peaceful

The only communist leaders who were ""peaceful"" were those who instituted terror on their population to such inhumane degree, that nobdy dared to speak up anymore. That's not a peace I'd want to live within. It's frankly insulting to their victims to call that ""peaceful.""

We can quibble over whether Nazis or communists are worse. I'd probably agree with you that it was in fact the Nazis, if I had to make a call. But ""wayyyyy fucking worse?"" Either way, that's still **seriously fucking bad.** And it's not just about the historical actions. You have modern neo-nazis or ethno-nationalists who proclaim to want a pure ethnostate, but proclaim to restrict themselves to ""non-violent"" or ""democratic"" means, just as you have modern communists who use the same rhetoric.

Hungary and Poland were hostile as well. Pre-war doctrine hadn't considered Austrian side as a threat and that was barely fortified. Czechslovakia had some good defensible terrain on the borders, but it has very little territory to trade for. Theoretically they could retreat to the Carpathian mountains in Slovakia, to continue a guerrilla style war at best. And the 1,25 million number is vastly exaggerated. Czechoslovakia had maybe 30 divisions with the reserve divisions. A quarter of all the reserves were ethnic Germans, who were at best a liability and at worst an actively hostile element.

&gt; Foreign military intervention
&gt;Main article: 2011 military intervention in Libya
&gt;The Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Charlottetown was deployed to the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya on 2 March 2011, but did not take immediate action once arrived.[277] Seventeen days later, a multi-state coalition began a military intervention in Libya to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which was taken in response to events then occurring during the conflict. **That same day, military operations began, with US forces and one British submarine firing cruise missiles**.[278] the Royal Canadian Air Force, French Air Force, United States Air Force, and British Royal Air Force[279] undertaking sorties across Libya and a naval blockade by the Royal Navy.[280][281][282]

&gt; **From the beginning of the intervention, the coalition of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Qatar, Spain, UK and US[283][284][285][286][287] expanded to 17 states. Newer states mostly enforced the no-fly zone and naval blockade or provided military logistical assistance**. The effort was initially largely led by the United States.[278] NATO took control of the arms embargo on 23 March, named Operation Unified Protector. An attempt to unify the military command of the air campaign (while keeping political and strategic control with a small group), first failed due to objections by the French, German, and Turkish governments.[288][289] On 24 March, NATO agreed to take control of the no-fly zone, while command of targeting ground units remained with coalition forces.[290]",Occitania,/r/europe/comments/9i7op3/europe_is_no_menu_à_la_carte_macron_tells/e6j21n5/,MetaParser,1537757763

No that was David Cameron's idea, he tried to negotiate a better deal to avoid a vote. He wasn't given one from Europe so there was a vote. People didn't like the deal we have so they voted to leave. Now we're negotiating whether Europe will continue to have access to our markets, we will continue to house 3.5million Europeans, we won't tax everything they sell to us and you can continue to allow Brits to holiday in Spain without a hassle, while keeping an open border with Ireland. But, looks like those reasonable suggestions have also been rejected by Europe.

Its quite straight forward, the British wanted a better deal as a net contributor and weren't given one 3 times.

2585,"&gt;A new measurement of UK poverty published last week by the Social Metrics Commission highlighted that more than half of families living below the breadline contained at least one person with a disability.

Hmm.  That seems awfully high.  And one possible cause would be that few non-disabled people are below that bar, which would be a good thing.

However, another cause would be widespread disability benefit fraud.

Statistics make a pretty convincing argument that disability fraud in the US is disappointingly common — unemployment benefits terminate, but someone with a permanent disability stays on the dole.  'Course, you'll never get much money, but it keeps on coming.

Not exactly true. Fortification by itself is not sufficient defense. However, fortification supported by active army is much better. In any time frame, from ancient age to modern age.

And while France did not utilized their fortification in greater numbers because german army just went around it... there are cases where three men in single bunker in Ardens stopped invasion for several hours. Because of the fortified bunker and because of the terrain, which did not enabled more motorized German army menuvre around it.

The SNP were always going to push for a second independence referendum. The most that Brexit could have done is hastened it, but I'm not even sure of that any more. It's worth remembering that the SNP won nearly all Scottish seats in 2015, after the independence referendum, but before the Brexit referendum. Support for independence remained at roughly the same level that it got during the 2014 referendum. So it's clear that independence remained politically salient. The SNP were just looking for an excuse to call for a second independence referendum. If it wasn't Brexit then it would be something else.

It's worth remembering that since using Brexit to bang on the independence drum, support for the SNP has dropped. They lost a hell of a lot of seats in the 2017 election. There's nothing inevitable about a second independence referendum.

Even ants know that centrally planning their transportation would slow down the entire colony. This graphic looks good on the surface until you think of the basic logistics and realize that the one time cost of producing all those cars vastly outweighs the (opportunity) cost of all the extra transportations needed to get everyone on and off that bus.

2697,"I think you have some of the things confused. There is indeed such a story as we are the result of romans and dacians. Partially it did happen but in reality it was only a small part of the Dacian territory that got conquered in the end. Not sure if this has any relevance to the nationalists, however,  nationalists only focus on the dacians and dismiss, or rather omit of mentioning, romans most of the time. It's not because of disrespect but because they focus more on how brave they were (or so they believe), simple people that stood against the romans and fought very hard that they even got a mentioning on the Trajan column for their bravery. So if you were to ask nationalists of their origins they would say dacians.

Lots of things have happened since then, invasions, empires and what not but people do believe in the continuity of the dacians. In reality this theory has very thin facts to prove there was some kind of continuity as we don't have any writings of our own from that time, only whatever everyone else around wrote about them in that time, like for example Herodotus (Greek historian in that time) who wrote that Getae were the bravest of the Thracians and so on. We do have the word of some later leaders, from like XV century onward, when our first writings started, pagan customs from those believed dacian times, sites, items, some supposed left over words and whatever else. 

There are indeed some extremist nationalist that have all kind of weird ideas and view this civilization like it was totally superior to others in some kind way. The others nationalists focus more on spirituality. Don't forget about Zalmoxis and its religion, so lots of things to be reinterpreted here and fantasize about it. Some things are mentioned by the greeks but not much. 

On the other hand it was right to mention that one as a king. Dacian had plenty of kings, all  mentioned by the roman or greek historians, or others in the north. Don't imagine dacians like some kind of barbarian tribes from prehistoric times. Greeks named barbar other cultures who couldn't speak greek. So far it seems they were pretty organized. They also built various things from gold and silver, all sorts of jewelry, and some of them exist even today. A recent discovery was about a road made from cubes of limestone and andesite brought from far away, paved with tiles, something quite fancy made by the dacians. If I am to make a joke, they built better roads than we  do today. They had gold  coins so probably a trading systems? The romans were after the natural resources like gold, something that dacians had plenty of. The mountains with gold are still there today. 

In the end whatever is the real truth, which is quite uncertain, there is indeed a nationalistic view of those times which doesn't reflect the reality. Some of them quite exaggerated or quite unreal, some of them a bit similar to those conspiracy theories you can find around the globe. This got fueled even more by the communists and our dictator, giving stories about dacians being brave and modest, something to inspire the crowds that were starved by the communists and to keep them controlled. So in a way this feeling of pride is because a lot of people feel like their national identity got stripped and they feel the need to identify with someone or something, or at least this is how I can explain to myself what's going on. The thing is, this feeling of pride is about everything that is somehow related to them, even if it's just vy nationality or somehow far related... so that piece of history is not the only thing. Personally I don't know how someone can be so proud of someone else work.

2701,"Since China is demanding an apology from Sweden regarding the recent tourist spat I thought this would be a great time to highlight the fact that China is currently holding a swedish citizen hostage for the outrageous crime of using his universal right of free speech to criticize the chinese communist party and government.

Some backstory in short version;

15 October 2015 Gui Minhai gets kidnapped by China from Thailand for excerising his universal right to freedom of speech by writing books and pamphlets critical towards the chinese communist party and chinese government.

He spends 2 Years imprisoned for that but is finally released but denied the right to leave China.

19 January 2018 Gui Minhai is traveling by train alongside 2 swedish diplomats to a doctors appointment. But gets kidnapped again by chinese government official right infront of the 2 swedish diplomats!

Early february the chinese government releases a hostage video of Gui Minhai intended for domestic chinese consumption where Gui Minhai is forced to ""confess"" various crimes and renounce all legal and diplomatic help from Sweden.

He has now been held hostage for over 1000 days for the sole crime of criticizing the chinese communist party &amp; government.

As a swedish citizen I find this to be absolutely outrageous and disgusting that one of our citizens is being treated this way and it is very disturbing that China is able to do this with impunity.

2719,"1. I don’t think you know the definition of a subsidy. 
In layman’s terms, a subsidy is a form a financial aid. This assumes that governments invest more in roads than they get from car ownership related taxes, which is totally untrue for pretty much every European country. 

2. There is no such thing as “massive infrastructure projects” going on in Europe. I don’t know the exact numbers, but I’m pretty sure I would be far off to say that China probably build more kms of motorway in the last two years than Europe has in the last two decades. Europe is struggling to maintain it’s current infrastructure, which is only getting crappier and more expensive at the same time. Look at Italy for fuck sake. They charge an arm and a leg to use their motorways and they can’t repair a bridge to keep it from collapsing. Heck, look at Germany and their “legendary” autobahns which they struggle to maintain because “Mutti” is more concerned with the well being of migrants than her country’s vital infrastructure - just check and compare how much money Germany spent last year on migrants and how much it spent on infrastructure and then judge for yourself what’s actually being subsidized. 

3. Motorways aren’t built for private cars, but for commercial vehicles. Private car owners are only secondary beneficiaries of a motorway. Motorways lower transportation costs so that’s why cities which are well connected by motorways are more developed than cities which are not. Look at the Dutch - their cities are very car unfriendly, but they still have a world class motorway network, that’s because they’re not idiots, they know how vital is for their economy to keep the freight moving.

At the meeting at the company's headquarters with Alibaba Vice President Helen Hu and the company's team for Europe, it was agreed that by the end of the year, all plans will be finalized with the ultimate goal of placing the Alipay electronic payment platform on the Serbian market, and that the Chinese market is promoting tourism offer of Serbia.

2746,"The Iron Crown of Lombardy (Italian: Corona Ferrea; Latin: Corona Ferrea Langobardiae) is both a reliquary and one of the oldest royal insignias of Christendom. It was made in the Early Middle Ages, consisting of a circlet of gold and jewels fitted around a central silver band, which tradition holds to be made of iron beaten out of a nail of the True Cross. The crown became one of the symbols of the Kingdom of the Lombards and later of the medieval Kingdom of Italy. It is kept in the Cathedral of Monza, outside Milan.

The Iron Crown is so called because it was believed to contain a one centimetre-wide band of iron within it, said to be beaten out of a nail used at the crucifixion of Jesus. The outer circlet of the crown is made of six segments of beaten gold, partly enameled, joined together by hinges. It is set with twenty-two gemstones[note 1] that stand out in relief, in the form of crosses and flowers. Its small size and hinged construction have suggested to some that it was originally a large armlet or perhaps a votive crown. According to other opinions, however, the small size is due to a readjustment after the loss of two segments, as described in historical documents.

According to tradition, St. Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, had the crown forged her son around a beaten nail from the True Cross, which she had discovered. Pope Gregory the Great passed this crown to Theodelinda, princess of the Lombards, as a diplomatic gift, although he made no mention of it among his recorded donations.

Thanks to the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, if we're talking about European monarchies at least.

&gt; That's how science works as well. Is science a church? 

Not exactly no. If we're talking about science when it applies to human, we have to talk about social sciences, and they never go ""if you don't believe what I say you're evil"". When someone like Emmanuel Todd finds a correlation between the maps of the places where people believed the most in communism ideas and the maps of family structures, he doesn't go ""and if you don't believe my map you're stupid"" or ""it's knowledge therefore you do not have the right to question it"". He propose his theory, it's peer reviewed and the scientists who disagree use scientific tools to try to come up with other theories that might explain this correlation better than Todd's. They don't just go ""meh evil"".

There are historians who have worked on the history of ideas in France, Todd's life-long work on family structure is also very well respected between demographer, you have the work of economists like Frederic Lordon on capitalism seen from Spinoza's point of view as a regime of desires or Bernard Friot on the evolution of the working class in France and the pseudo-communist revolution of 1946, the work of sociologists like the Pinçon-Charlot on the code of the dominant class or Bourdieu on symbolic violence, the work of social psychology on the impact of symbols and how the current system is teaching you to be a slave, and you're just going ""communism is evil, capitalism isn't an ideology, I know better than scientists"".

We are not putting our history as an example of how to be the ""good guys"" in the world. 

This.

And let's not go back much in time, I was just a kid in 1999, but I remember quite well all the Timor Leste struggle, with USA supporting Indonesia (who was commiting genocides and plenty of atrocities against the people of Timor), all because those living in Timor had decided to have a Communist government, and God forbide those poor farmers living in the mountains of a small island of going against the USA way of doing things.

The USA, the country with the loudest voice at the time, with more decision power in the United Nations and in the world in general, was silence. 

Meanwhile in Portugal at the time, we made a 10km human-chain connecting the 5 embassies of the UN Permanent Members in Lisbon, and then thousands of people went to Madrid (~600km) to protest in front of the embassy of Indonesia (there wasn't one in Portugal, at least at the time). Even songs were made about the struggle of Timor at the time.

[Video of the portuguese protest in support of Timor Leste](http://videos.sapo.pt/vZ6gUjt4KzMYSoS2TUmN)

Everybody does mistakes, all the countries in the world did mistakes, from Portugal and Spain, to Indonesia and even Timor, but at least the majority of the people can look back at those moments and understand their own mistakes and avoid them, while the policy of the USA was always of ""calling"" himself the ""number one"", and that's way people nowadays are still living in the American dream, the world changed, Europe changed, but unfortunately a country filled with good and passionate people, with a rich history is still sleeping…

Realistically, each lane of traffic has a capacity of one car per two or three seconds.

2851,"&gt; You could make the same argument for vaccinations

It isn't even remotely the same argument. Partly because for many years in history and still currently in 3rd world countries there is a massive infant death rate where vaccinations are not performed.

There is also data appearing where large groups of people have chosen not to vaccinate of serious outbreaks of various deceases in the western world have caused such out breaks including mutations causing infections of others.

&gt; deciding what's right culturally, religiously and even sexually for many minority groups

They are not actually deciding this. They are decided for the person who is not capable of defending themselves or being able to consent to such brutality. While there is some overlap of course. The overlap fails when such a person (as infant) grows to age and chooses not to practice that religion. At that point your way or thing has some very difficult explaining to do as to why you chopped their foreskin off.

Just like If I came from a tribe who practices cutting off the left ear from everyone who had seen them. With your line of thinking it would be perfectly ok for me to hold you down and cut off your left ear without your consent. You would be a bit pissed off after? Have to realise that permanent changes for religious practices are not ok because the person effected has not given consent. Instead you probably would be better attempting to alter the status quo for example asking for consent on somebodies 16th birthday.

The thing about doing things because that's how ""things are down around here"" is an extremely poor way to behave in an advancing society. If you know the story of the 5 monkeys + cage + banana. Where you feed the 5 monkeys with a single banana. The one that eats it gets away free. The 4 that do not get beaten / tortured. what they happens when you do this a few times none of the monkeys will eats the banana because the others will stop them. This gets more interesting cause when you swap out a monkey for a new monkey they will be prevented from eating the banana by the others. This also happens if you continue to swap monkeys out until none of the original monkeys are left. Its just ""how things are done around here"". the monkeys of course have learned this behaviour and won't unlearn this even when there is no beating's for the monkeys cause none will ever eat the banana. Just because it is done that way. Doesn't make it right when things change and that's culture... sometimes it needs changed cause its toxic.

The above also works with humans as well. Which is actually just about the only reason why religion actually survives in the modern world. People are not born religious. They are told this is how we do things around here and you have to do it too.

2867,"I've always loved travelling in Europe, learning languages and humbly experiencing/observing foreign customs, and would love to live and work on the continent - probably not forever, because England is my home, but the system is (at least partially) built with that fluidity in mind. Specifically, I was born long after the rights to freedom of movement were first made law in the UK. I've always had that delightful thought in my mind: Europe is a place of relative freedom where you can travel around without much restriction. And, now, that's taken away from me - it's like having your citizenship revoked. It's also monstrously unfair for the people who moved here looking for a better life (or for whatever reason - it's their business and they, in my opinion, are welcome regardless). I just hope there will be some option to gain a European citizenship.

It really seems like it's a ridiculous, self-assured, old-boys'-club oligarchy which rules Britain. Cameron promulgated the referendum with the arrogant presumption that remain would win the vote. He failed. The whole British political establishment was caught at the trough: they had no plan. Now the only ones with the stomach to negotiate Brexit are those who hate Europe, because everyone else knows it's insane. There is no coherent 'plan', only furious reactionary jingoism. ""No deal is better than a bad deal.""

""Red, white, and blue Brexit"" - how particularly sad, antiquated, and unproductive that mantra sounds to me. It's nationalist rhetoric better suited to the nineteenth century. It's quite moving (in a bewildered way) to think that so many pine for some sort of ideal Britain which existed at some vague time prior to the 1960s. Ironically, it's a sentiment shared with many other (particularly old or eastern) Europeans. I think a forward-looking Britain - and Europe - tackling inevitable economic and demographic change as part of a wider international cooperative community (united in liberty, human rights, and maybe a bit of socialism here and there) sounds rather better than all that. 

Even so, I suppose an exit from the union can be done with at least a little bit of care and rationality. Yet May is obliterating that possibility with particular zeal. As far as I perceive it, the government is even 'doing-the-wrong-thing-wrong'. What a pointless, damaging, and sad debacle.

2906,"You are totally right, it is expensive and takes up a lot of space. This is why a close collaboration with municipalities is crucial. I myself work with public transport and this is one of our long term goals. We are very much involved in infrastructure projects with the municipalities. We try to make them build more seperate bus lanes for example. 

It is very different in every country. In my region we are a public administration  (don't know if this is the right term) and we purchase the traffic from different bus companies, for example Transdev. As we are a public organization we need to be availible for every citizen whatever the cost. We have a minimum amount of traffic for x amount of inhabitants in cities to follow. 

I think the future of public transport is where you can mix different kind of transportation (car, bike, bus, tram, train) in an easy way, lile through an app. You should be able to buy your trip including all different transport methods.

2969,"&gt; I'm guessing though

Don't guess. It's making an assumption and falsely labeling people without enough information.

Muslim only prisons make sense. You can give them a mosque and they'll be happy with that, no more people converting to radical Islam in the prison. Did you hear about those prisoners forming a gang to protect themselves from constant Islamic assaults within the prison? It makes sense to separate them from the other prisoners and you know, if a Muslim in prison doesn't want to be around all of those radical elements he can request transition to a normal prison.

Sometimes you have to look past identity politics to solve problems, if specifically Muslims are causing a lot of trouble it's logical to separate them from the others to protect other prisoners from being harmed.

&amp;#x200B;

Islam is a problem religion in general, especially now with Saudi Arabia funding mosques all around Europe, which is basically equates to them funding centers for radicalization of Muslims in our countries. Keep in mind that even Saudi Arabia has a reasonably sized network of spies that infiltrates their own mosques to make sure they're not preaching an even more radical form of Islam than Wahabbist Islam. 

You think this is an ok situation or should we actually help transform Islam from a Fascist ideology that encourages people to go blow up train stations into a peaceful Western religion that respect Western values of free speech, gender equality, etc.?",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/9hz3dm/a_short_history_of_britains_relationship_with_the/e6i6221/,blaskowich,1537728792

Don't for a minute think that was done out of solidarity, and the greatest beneficiary was the US itself (contracts for their companies, exports to rebuild Europe, etc.). Some parts of Western Europe benefited yes, but the ultimate goal was politically influencing Europe while enriching American companies and businessmen. In fact it was not at all too different from what China is doing today in Africa.

If communism and the USSR hadn't been there, the US wouldn't have spent a single penny in Europe. It was all geopolitical strategy.

&gt;There is a world of difference between America having influence in Europe and China having influence.

3221,"&gt; NATO prevented the whole continent being steamrolled by the Soviets. 

What a warped view of history. Look, if the USSR wanted to ""steamroll"" Western Europe, they'd simply done so, MAD or not.

Especially in the context that the USSR has had conventional superiority the whole time while having had temporary strategical superiority too (Sputnik shock anybody? Cuba?) several times over the course of the cold war.

This fairy tale of ""only the NATO nuclear shield prevented Western Europe from being overrun by the USSR"" is just that, a fairy tale, the situation was way more complex, and grey, than most people would want to admit these days. It was a dangerous stand-off between two sides where none wanted to be perceived as ""weak"", it's a prime example of human history where vain hubris nearly lead to the destruction of our whole species.

Due to USSR conventional advantage, NATO was ready to literally sacrifice large parts of Germany as a nuclear wasteland with a nuclear escalation policy heavily leaning on the use of [tactical nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon).

Like that would have stopped a determined USSR leadership who had no issue sacrificing their people, in the millions, for much more mundane reasons.

3248,"About Ukrainian alphabet: 

1. Discussion: *apostrophe* is letter or no? Today official answer is *no*. 
- No letter for sounds [d͡ʒ] and [d͡z]. For example, Macedonian has for them *џ* and *ѕ*.
- Problem with grapheme *й*: *и* with *brevе*, so *short и* but in reality is *short і*, simple solution is Serbian _j_.
- Alpabet has some letters which is easy to remove:
 - iotation vowels: *я* → *йа* or *ьа*; *ю* → *йу* or *ьу*; *є* → *йе* or *ье*; *ї* → *йі* or *йи*; that is also easy remove *apostrophe*, here is already *йо* and *ьо*;
 - *щ* → *шч*. 

So, quick math: 33 + 2 − 5 = 30, like for South Slovic languages.  

Last 2 is also actual for Muscowian but with little changes:

1. problem with grapheme *ы* which is *ь* + *i* (tnot exist) and early was *ꙑ* which is *ъ* + *і* which is more logic. 
- same with iotation vowels:
 - *е* → *йэ* or *ьэ*, *э*; *ё* (usually is writed as *e*) → *йо* or *ьо*; and so on with *я* and *ю*; that also remove hard-sign *ъ*;
 - *щ* → *шь* + remove rules about *hard sound* (_шына_) and *gender* (_мыш_).

So, 33 − 6 = 27. 

About Polish. To be hoset, I do not know very well orthoepy, as I know, but:

- *ó* = *u*, help only for spelling during cases.
- *ć*, *ń*, *ś* and *ź* easily could be removed for *ї*: *siwy* → *sïwy*, *siarka* (not changed), *cześć* → *czesici* — *ï* is when *i* is not only for soft-consonant.
- *ł* → *l*; *l* → *li*: *lalka* → *lialika*, *Łódź* → *Ludzi*. Or *ł* → *w*; *w* → *v*, and *l* would be alone soft letter without soft-letter *i* and here is not «remove» letter and «etymological», so problem with grapheme.

3266,"&gt; It's a concession when one party gives more than they get in return. 

Yeah, that's why your examples where the UK share something with the EU and the EU shares the same thing back isn't a concession, it's a compromise. That's why something like ""The UK has said it is willing to solve EU-UK disputes with a neutral joint committee"" -&gt; compromise, not concession.

&gt; Such as offering 40 billion in exchange for a few months of a transition period (even though it would have made sense to offer nothing at all in exchange for a transition period, because that's a logical step which benefits both countries).

&gt;Yes, that was the arrangement. But even then, paying £40 billion for that is a pretty big concession on the UK's part.

&gt; It was always an option. That's why it was negotiated. It's why much of the UK and the government was shocked when the EU demanded 100B and even more shocked when the government agreed to pay any of it.

First off, not seeing the 100B figure anywhere. I believe those aren't the real figures. I know, however, that France + Germany wanted 60B, and they ended up agreeing with 40B.

Your whole point is that the UK can pull out of any deal whenever they can, and hence can refuse to pay what they owe the EU, because there is no consequences involved. The answer is ""no"". Even if the transition period is ""the logical step"", it doesn't mean the EU has to guarantee it if the UK pulls off.

Here's some examples of what a no-deal with no transition period looks like : 

- No UK planes can go to any EU countries. Furthermore, the UK access to the EU airspace becomes restricted. This alone is just... probably reason enough.

- What about the transportation of nuclear materials? Well, that one is overseen by the European commission... so how do you get your uranium in case of a no transition period? Yep, you don't get it. How about procedures that require such materials? (X-ray, for example?) Same, not gonna happen if there's no transition.

- What about the global trade? Well, under WTO you are going to operate under the Most favoured nation status. I can expand on why it's bad for the UK.

- Also, the UK economy consists in 80% of services. This is tricky to take care of under WTO. One more problem to the pile.

- What about spatial projects? What about the use of GPS in the UK? The UK already lost access to Galileo development. This jeopardises any chances it would have to continue on the project.

- What about international exchanges? Education? What about the students under the Erasmus that are currently in the EU?  

- What about research? What happens to the research in the EU that the UK is currently funding? 

- etc. 

The consequences from simply walking away from their **obligations** to pay these 40B are harsh. Not to mention that they'd be obligated to start making deals with the US / China, and you can be sure that breaking this agreement would not put them in a good position, not even considering the fact that they would already be pretty unfavored in such a deal. 

Here's the list of everything you should worry about should a no-deal happen, btw. Just gloss over it, and imagine what would happen should the UK get a no deal, no transition period, and how much regulation they'd have to implement in the six months they have left. It's simply not doable.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinkibon_Ltd_v_Stahag_Stahl_und_Stahlwarenhandelsgesellschaft_mbH

That case is cited in Aus as a common law principle because its logical and everyone agrees with it. Nobody has legislated over it.


&gt;In the US however they not only have precedent (higher courts) but also case law (it doesn't need to come from higher courts as far as I know).

same thing.. courts of record. If its the lowest court in the hierarchy, the other party for sure is going to ask for an appeal to a court of record on a point of law. Thats the thing about precedent, to change it you need to apply to appeal it and the case is usually heard in front of multiple judges.

&gt;My point is that if precedent is binding then you undermine judicial independence and also lets judges create laws.

????

&gt;If a Law says: If you do B you'll be punished with A. And there is binding precedent that B happens when C, D and E conditions are met then it's no different from legislating that If you do C, D and E you'll be punished with A (but it should be actual legislators doing that, not judges).

but if thats the case why dont the parliaments just legislate over the precedent... they dont...

i will give you an example.

In sentencing law in Australia, there is no list sentencing like the US (or even 'two-stage sentencing') its a full holistic analysis called 'Instinctive synthesis' where the judge looks at principles and overarching obligations and the case and makes a decision. A couple years ago, the High court of Australia said that the sentencing purposes of Specific Deference (which was a common law Sentencing purpose) was obsolete because the Fundamental principle of proportionality (sentence needs to be proportionate to the crime). If a murder was gruesome, proportionality would say the sentence needs to be relatively higher and so specific deterrence would not push the sentence higher. Also specific deterrence in its core goes against handing down a proportionate sentence.

2 weeks later the parliament makes a law mandating courts to consider Specific Deference. The judges now just mention it when considering proportionality rather than using it as a purposes when considering factors. 

When a parliament lets the precedent stand, they allow/approve of its existence. When they legislate over it, they strike the precedent.

Eg:

http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/vic/VSCA/2013/82.html

Bifel v The Queen [2013] VSCA 82 at [4]

&gt;4	Unlike other considerations which are properly regarded for sentencing purposes as aggravating factors (and therefore justify the imposition of a harsher penalty than would otherwise be appropriate), deterrence (whether special or general) involves the imposition of a more severe punishment than would be justified if the sole consideration were the degree of criminality involved in the offence. General deterrence necessarily subjects the offender to a punishment, harsher than would otherwise be the case, fixed in part in the hope that its overall severity, while not directly justified by the extent of the offender’s criminality, will temper the criminal tendencies of others. It is in my opinion thus clear that injustice

&gt;would result were general deterrence to so overwhelm other sentencing principles that a particular sentence became disproportionately rather than proportionately harsh when measured against the degree of criminality of which the offender is guilty.

_23.09.2018_

The People have popular votes about:
- Extension of the bycicle road network
- Fair food
- food sovereignty of Switzerland
- Regional Votes



**Extension of the bycicle road network**

This initiative tries to make bycicle roads equal to hicking trails. This would make the gouverment obligated to map these tracks and maintain them.

**Food sovereignty of Switzerland**

Tries to strengthen the Swiss agriculture so it may nourish the whole Swiss Population. Also it should be Naturefriendly and Genetic Manipulation free.

**Fair Food**

Wants to force every company that delivers food into Switzerland to adapt Swiss Guidelines (wich are pretty harsh).  These Guidelines include but aren‘t limited to: Animal Friendly production, good payment for the workers and nature friendly work.

The votes are still being counted and a update from me will follow when this is done.

**regional votes**

Following are the Regional Votes, the Region and the outcome:

[SG] Voted that Burkas now are illegal

**Outcome of the National votes**

- Fairfood *declined**
- Food sovrengity  **declined**
- Bycicle Ways  **accepted**

EDIT: Let's make a summary for the lazy...

&gt;Since 2010, Norway barely had any diplomatic relations with China, due to the fact that Chinese activist Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize that same year. The Chinese government **demanded an apology** from Norway […] since the five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee is an ***independent institution***, the Norwegian government was in no position to issue neither an apology nor a guarantee. Nevertheless, ***China decided to punish Norway*** by immediately shelving a free-trade agreement that was being negotiated.

Later on...

&gt;When declaring the re-establishment of ties with China, Brende also had to present a two-page joint declaration that included passages like: “The Norwegian government reiterates its commitment to the One China Policy, fully respects China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, ***attaches high importance to China’s core interests and major concerns***, will not support actions that undermine them, and ***will do its best to avoid any future damage to the bilateral relations.***”

* relative uniformity accross borders eases trade and cultural exchanges

* for the sovereigns and national executives, uniform laws accross the country was also a tool to assert the preeminence of the central government over the local customs, [which was vital in the late 19^th centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848).

My point is that if precedent is binding then you undermine judicial independence and also lets judges create laws.

If a Law says: If you do B you'll be punished with A. And there is *binding* precedent that B happens when C, D and E conditions are met then it's no different from legislating that If you do C, D and E you'll be punished with A (but it should be actual legislators doing that, not judges).

You might not call it a law strictly speaking but in my conception of ""source of law"" it definitely is.

In my country the Supreme Court also sets doctrine and other courts take it into account but it's definitely not binding. It's not even binding for the Supreme Court if they can distinguish each case enough and reason as to why they should be treated differently.

The only exception to this is how the Constitutional Court (it's not part of the judicial structure) sets precedent as to how the Constitution should be interpreted but that makes sense imo because the Constitution is supposed to be a limit to legislative power.

3425,"&gt;Literally everyone in the world says Estonia is Baltic country. 

No... You need to understand context behind it and most people don't know jack shit about Estonia.

&gt;Just because you speak another language or practice another faith doesn't mean you're totally different from your neighboring country

My god, do you even listen to yourself?

&gt;I said this because shit tons of Estonians think they're Nordic and they get mad when proven otherwise, which I don't understand.

Nobody ""proves otherwise"", they mostly just mass dowvote these opinions because they have pre-conceived stereotypes about a country they know nothing about. Their mass opinion is of little relevance here.

&gt;Just take for example Greece. Everyone lists it as a Mediterranean country even tho it's orthodox unlike rest of Mediterranean and is Hellenic unlike other Mediterranean countries which are Roman. Heck, it even writes in Greek alphabet unlike others which write in Latin. BUT, does anyone say it's not Mediterranean? No, because it is. Just like Estonia is Baltic country despite being different than Latvia and Lithuania. Just like the water is wet. Geography doesn't have anything to do with history and culture. If you don't get this, then there's no hope for you.

Greece is still culturally relatively similar with Italy and Spain due to its specific warm climate that isn't shared by many other European countries. What is special about our climate?

&gt;They're interchangeable.

You are trying to argue against a widely accepted scientific concept. Why are you inventing things?

&gt;Just like people use the word ""Turks"" both for Turkic ethnic nationalities and Turkish people.

Turks *are* a Turkic ethnicity ffs, Estonia *is not* a Balitc ethnicity...

&gt;When I said Baltic I meant 3 countries. I'm amazed how you don't get it.

You argued against me with simplistic statements, meaning you lack knowledge about the subject.

&gt;This is totally different.

There is *nothing* different about this. Russia is responsible for Soviet crimes.

&gt;Nazi Germany was made by the will of its people. Hitler was democratically elected if you don't remember.

This changes nothing.

&gt;Nazi Germany before 1939 was a homogenous country with vast majority being Germans. USSR was established only after years of brutal civil war where tens of millions died to prevent communism, including Russians. Also, USSR was heterogeneous and Russia made up only 60% of USSR population. 

This is where your lack of knowledge strikes out. The Soviet Union was a Russian empire in disguise, Russification was its key political tool.

&gt;In theory Russia is the successor, in reality it's way more complex than you think.

In reality, only pro-Kremlin people think the way you do. Russia is the *sole* legal successor of the Soviet Union according to both international law and Russia's national law.

&gt;So you're saying France and Western Europe countries didn't do bad things?

They are bad for the things they did. Nobody defends colonialism today, yet Russia denies its crimes and even glorifies them. *That* is what sets them apart from normal European nations.

&gt;That's highly subjective coming from an Estonian.

There is nothing subjective about facts.

&gt;I literally have no reason to defend Russia. I'm not Russian and I don't even like Russia that much.

""That much""? That sounds rather weird.

&gt;I think Russia did bad and good things.

Did Nazi Germany also do ""bad *and* good things""?

&gt;On the other hand, you and the rest of Estonians despise Russia because of something USSR did in the past.

Duh... But it's not only that, modern Russia also does bad things.

&gt;I wonder if you also despise your Russian neighbors who live in the same country as you do.

Depends if they hold pro-Russian views or not. Many of them do and of course I feel the same about them.

&gt;You literally are. Just type ""Baltic"" in Google and see for yourself

Popularity of a statement does not mean said statement is correct. As I told you, most people, assumingly including you, know jack shit about the country.

&gt;Of course not, but that's the mentality of you guys, Poles and the rest of /r/europe

This is important because painting it as a second referendum is what dilutes its importance, making it out it's an attempt to get ""the result the elites wanted"" (or some bollocks brexiteers froth about).

In fact, it's a completely different referendum that always made logical sense and was talked about even before the first one. 

I'm British and a remainer. I studied international relations at uni and did absolutely 100% nothing with it, instead working in retail management. That said, I'm an internationalist and I love you bloody Europeans. Some of my absolute best team members have been European and they put a lot of the British guys to shame.

I still feel May is playing some 4D chess. I think she knows her time is short, so she can either lose her job as PM with a terrible legacy or lose it with a good legacy.

She's pushing chequers which is universally disliked - better to just stay in for remain and for leavers it's not kamikaze enough. She knows it won't get through parliament, but will try. It won't. We are then at a crossroads - do we leave with no deal or put it to the people? May isn't stupid - she's worked in government long enough to know no deal would be a disaster and as much as the narrative is to blame it on the EU, the Tories would not recover to the electorate for a long time. 

Crash out and she loses her job with a legacy of complete failure. Put it to the people, who will most likely choose to stay in, and resign with a legacy far better than the alternative.

I'm glad these balkan countries are  better, but we ought to remember that PPP conversion ratios are *very* generous to them (exceptions being Croatia and Slovenia) and not always fully representative of true standards of living (people don't live for rent costs, after all, but count their material standard in what they can buy from their discretionary income)",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9i28x6/croatia_and_bulgaria_the_poorest_eu_members_have/e6gyrew/,FriendOfOrder,1537671371

I do and also understand the history and underlying nuances of social interactions over here. Unless you've spent any amount of time in Europe I'll  just be considering you well intentioned but naive.

No, comparing the natives in Canada to gypsies (yes gypsies - not romani) is flawed from the start. The circumstances and not even close to being the same but I'm not going to delve into that, that's another can of worms.

I can’t believe the hypocrisy here: in a city that is heavily touristic, heavily expensive Airbnb is the problem? Amsterdam wouldn’t get more expensive otherwise when all prices rise up anyway? Why don’t they tax it and get money out of it? There was no black market before? What about the Center that is full of silly souvenir shops and huge malls? Doesn’t this destroy the social coherence? Do locals hang out in the Center? I strongly doubt and this is not Airbnb fault. 

I lived in Edinburgh before Amsterdam: everybody was complaining again about Airbnb but on the other hand huge block of flats were demolished by real estate companies, to build student accommodation, ending up rising prices and pushed locals away and letting ghost neighbourhoods during summer that students were away. Students are fine and tourist not?

I watch Airbnb in my home city: it forces the owner to renovate the house and the neighbourhood has significantly improved since newcomers arrived (you know not all cities are like Amsterdam). The price stays very low because it is a cheap city anyway. Also if you ever run a small room you will notice that has extremely a lot of work to do and expenses: pass the keys, clean the room, electricity bill rockets,  communication with the visitors, house damages and periodically repairs and anyway it gets taxed...so overall people make money and the economy moves around it, what’s the problem with it? It is ok when corporations do it but everyday people are not allowed right? Hypocrisy inmho.

And finally: I saw several studies that prove Airbnb has very small effect in price rise, especially in big cities, they suggest those cities were already expensive anyway...(Google:Airbnb price rise studies)",,/r/europe/comments/8jxoh3/amsterdam_to_ban_airbnb_and_bump_up_tourist_tax/e6gz01s/,Xbass540,1537671648

3772,"So, I really really dont want to do a quote fight, but:

&gt; -inhumane amounts of vacation time, sick leave bundled into vacation and very limited as well

&gt; -the lack of parental leave (if you want kids)

&gt; -the workaholic culture just a notch above East Asians

This is entirely based on the company you work for and once you get out of the entry-level workforce, the benefits start becoming increasingly nicer. This is a bit of the best I've seen, but as an example, I worked at a company which provided paid vacation for your entire family to anywhere in the world for an entire month after 5 years of working for them. Two months after 10 years. This does not include paid time off or sick days. While this is one of the better outliers, most companies, while not required by law, will provide benefits such as time off and parental leave to their employees as an incentive. It's definitely not as bad as you have been hearing. As for the culture, you can definitely not work that hard - I've worked with people who dont do jack shit at their job - but you shouldn't expect to move up in a company doing so.

&gt; -the unhealthy processed food filled to the brim with HFCS, sweeteners and whatnot

I'm really not sure what your image of America is, but we dont just all eat processed foods. There's plenty of organic food available to purchase and it's completely up to you to eat the unhealthy stuff or not. No one is forcing you.

&gt; -the fact that losing your job effectively means you lose your healthcare (being tied to the goodwill of an employer, yay corporate slavery)

No it doesn't, you can still get healthcare once unemployed.

&gt; -the fact that you can be fired for almost anything (at-will employment)

Thing is that if you get fired you can file for unemployment which basically means the company can be paying for you for up to a year. Companies dont want that and will avoid it at all cost. Usually if they really hate an employee, they will give them either nothing to do or a shitty job until they quit. 

&gt; -very religious and prudish population (Creationism is believed by about ~50% Americans, your kids likely will be taught abstinence-only sex ed, the extreme and unhealthy aversion to nudity and anything sexual-related if done in the presence of kids, even teenagers...

100% depends on where you live. Dont live in the bible belt, for example - pretty simple. I've never really experienced the things you've described. 

&gt; -extortionate amounts of college/university debt for students

This can be pretty bad, I'll admit. However, there are tons of scholarships out there that are really easy to get which can help. Also, (this might be controversial) but some people *really* shouldn't go to University when they know they wont get a viable degree to pay off loans later. I mean, if I was able to go to University for free, I would have gone into history, but instead I took a STEM degree and minored in history.

&gt; -power-hungry violent cops and criminals that often brandish guns, which is rarer in Europe, speaking of which,

&gt; -higher rates of violent crime than most of the EU

So ya, we have higher violent crimes in the US, but, again, it's really where you live. The thought that you will be in a shooting or in a violent crime if you come to this country is horribly misleading and inflated by the media.

&gt; -more inequality and crushing poverty

I was talking about middle class. Poverty and inequality doesn't affect the middle class.

&gt; -dysfunctional two-party system and combative political culture

The political tension right now is a pretty bad, but our whole government was built to be combative and dysfunctional. It's whole purpose is to have gridlock so that no one party can make sweeping motions that horribly affect the country.

Based on their votes relating to Brexit, I think most of them are at least willing to go along with the government on it. It's possible that a complete collapse could cause a party divide, but even then, it's questionable.

3831,"&gt;The American middle class is loaded compared to the vast majority of Europe.    

This is debatable as the US barely has a pension system and relies heavily on the people themselves to save money for retirement rather than saving it through taxes for them.   

Plenty of [studies](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/how-much-us-families-have-in-retirement-savings-and-how-much-they-need.html) have found that Americans, while reliant on themselves for retirement, simply aren't saving.    

&gt;The mean retirement savings for these families is $95,776 in 2013 dollars. That sounds considerable but, as the EPI points out, that number doesn't tell the whole story. Since so many families have zero savings and since super-savers can pull up the average, the median savings, or those at the 50th percentile, may be a better gauge. And the median for all working-age families in the U.S. is just $5,000.   

$5,000 median saved for families with parents between 32-61. Compare that to a country where $40,000 a year isn't exactly a high income and you'll see that while they have more disposable income during their working years, there are other expenses which just aren't being funded right now.

3842,"&gt; Uh... no? The UK is not forced to pay them. Who exactly do you propose is going to force the UK to pay? And what are these consequences? It's pretty standard that if multiple countries are participating in a long term project and one of the countries pulls out mid way through, that country stops contributing to the project. Treaties are not eternally binding and countries can simply pull out of them. The UK is under no obligation and the fact that it is willing to pay an absolutely insane amount of money out of pure generosity is stunning.

Uhm, no. Countries can't simply pull out of treaties like that. That's really not how it works. Let's break it down though.

&gt; The UK is not forced to pay them

Well, they signed some treaties forcing them to do so...

&gt; Who exactly do you propose is going to force the UK to pay? And what are these consequences?

The UK owns assets in the EU (approx $150B iirc?). Those assets can be frozen. Here's how they could be forced to pay.

The EU **has** ways of pressuring the UK on that matter. It's not as easy as simply refusing to pay.

&gt;  It's pretty standard that if multiple countries are participating in a long term project and one of the countries pulls out mid way through, that country stops contributing to the project. 

But this is not how the EU works. The UK agreed on continuing on paying for projects it accepted while still being in the EU. 

In turn, the EU would still pay for projects that take place in the UK even if the UK leaves. Still, a net deficit for the UK though.

&gt; Treaties are not eternally binding and countries can simply pull out of them.

If they want to lose $150B in assets and any deal with the EU in the future, then sure. The UK could simply pull out. 

... that's not a good choice, lol. 

&gt; The UK is under no obligation and the fact that it is willing to pay an absolutely insane amount of money out of pure generosity is stunning.

Well, with everything I said... I don't think there's any doubts that no, it's not motivated by pure generosity. It's motivated by the fact that losing $150B in assets + being known to have broken a treaty is way, way, way, way worse than paying $40B (or $60B, depending on who you ask.)

&gt; Plus let's be real, who's going to judge the UK? Right now, billions in EU funding is going into countries like Poland, where the ruling party has forcefully taken control of all branches of the government and media and is directly defying the EU, but is using Hungary to veto any EU sanctions. Why should the UK funnel money into a country like that?

That's **another** question, we can discuss that further if we reach an agreement on whether or not the UK is forced to pay. 

&gt; You're really overestimating how much the world outside the EU would care

I... don't think so. Even if they didn't lose their assets, I'd still wager breaking a deal just before needing to make other deals with the USA/China is a very, very bad situation to be in. 

&gt; The fact that it benefits both the UK and EU equally is why it's such a good concession.

Once again, this isn't a concession. Like, look at it this way...
 
- ""here's $100 for a chair that costs $100""

- ""here's $200 for a table that costs $200""

- ""Okay now can I buy your car for $1?""

The first two are echanges. They're not concessions that should help the third one happen. 

&gt; But instead of there being any deal, the UK has promised its intelligence community will continue to work with the EU regardless of the outcome - which is a huge concession. It could easily have withheld that guarantee and instead used it as a bargaining chip in the EU negotiations.

Yeah, that means the EU helps the UK with their intelligence and the UK helps the EU with their intelligence.

3844,"&gt; e.g. Scotland is gonna be pissed (more so than our usual base level) and more likely to want to leave due to Brexit but as that would put trading barriers between Scotland and England it would cause much more significant economic shockwaves than if Scotland had gone independent and then both Scotland and rUK stayed in the EU.

This is one of the reasons why I, as a Scottish Unionist, voted to leave the EU. An independence supporting friend of mine felt that the UK was an unnecessary layer of government.

3865,"&gt; I fail to see any possible way in which that could be worse than no deal.

Well, going back on what the 27 said about the May's proposition is **really bad**. Would end up being a huge destabilisation and prove the EU is ready to go back on what they said and need the UK really badly, which leaves room for the UK to negociate a preferential treatment reserved to EU members without being in the EU.

That'd kinda turn EU into a joke. I'm not sure exactly what **all** the consequences would be, but you can be sure there would be long-lasting damage caused to the EU by accepting the current UK deal.

&gt; I'm talking about the MPs - the ones who make the decision. Labour MPs have a history over recent years of going against the will of the members. For example, even though Labour members staunchly supported Corbyn's leadership, labour MPs tried for ages to get rid of him. It was quite a controversy. And it never really stopped. There's still a lot of insubordination among labour MPs.

Didn't know that, thanks for the precision! That's indeed problematic. (right now, and for democracy as a whole lol. We kinda have the same problem in France, where elected representatives don't really represent the will of the people who elected them... but what else is new.)

&gt; Based on their votes relating to Brexit, I think most of them are at least willing to go along with the government on it. It's possible that a complete collapse could cause a party divide, but even then, it's questionable.

This is so important because from the perspective of WWII where the US first began to flex its muscles.

The result of that was that they entered WWII as a juggernaut, flattened a European superpower and took all of the scientists and engineers and their research for their own use. Which later led them to develop the H Bomb and make the rest of the world cower at their might.

Why Europe should focus on its growing interdependence with Africa

Sealing the Mediterranean will not work

IT IS a peculiarly modern habit to think of the Mediterranean Sea as a boundary. For over two millennia, civilisations bled across it and intermingled. Roman, Carthaginian, Moorish and Venetian empires expanded primarily along maritime routes. It took four days to get from imperial Rome to today’s Tunisia, but 11 days to reach Milan. The Sahara restricted contact between this Mediterranean Eurafrica and the regions to the south, but not entirely. A study of 22 skulls from Roman London found that four were African, for example. The medieval wealth of desert trading cities like Timbuktu and Agadez spoke of extensive north-south commerce. Later European colonialists penetrated, pillaged and parcelled up the continent; African troops fought in the trenches of the first world war; Europeans fought in Africa in the second.

Three subsequent events curbed this trans-Mediterraneanism. European powers left Africa with decolonisation; many African states sought to be neutral during the cold war; Europeans turned towards Asia’s booming markets as globalisation took hold. Tellingly, the geopolitical buzzword of the moment is “Eurasia”. Europe and Asia are integrating along old Silk Road routes, especially under China’s Belt and Road infrastructure splurge, yet “Eurafrica” remains relatively little discussed. Europe is too busy rushing into Asia’s arms to embrace a continent on its doorstep which may be even more significant in the long term.

Today’s waves of African migration are merely a prelude. Of the 2.2bn citizens added to the global population by 2050, 1.3bn will be Africans—about the size of China’s population today. And more of them will have the means to travel. Those Africans risking the trip north across the Mediterranean today are not the poorest, but those with a mobile phone to organise the trip and money to pay smugglers. Few of the Nigerians who attempt the crossing are from their country’s poor north, for example; almost all are from its wealthier south. As African countries gradually prosper, migration will surely increase, not decrease. Emmanuel Macron raised these points in a recent interview. The French president was recommending a new book, “The Rush to Europe”, published in French by Stephen Smith of Duke University, which models past international migrations like that of Mexicans into America to show that the number of Afro-Europeans (Europeans with African roots) could rise from 9m at present to between 150m and 200m by 2050, perhaps a quarter of Europe’s total population.

The interdependence is growing in other areas, too. While Europe’s old Atlantic harbours stagnate, four of its five fastest-growing ports are on the Mediterranean (led by Piraeus in Greece). Much of this is driven by Asian trade, but the African share is rising too, and will mushroom as the continent continues to grow. Europe is increasingly reliant on Nigerian and Liberian minerals, and German environmentalists dream of giant Saharan solar plants feeding clean energy to Europe. The security situation on one shore of the Mediterranean increasingly affects the other. The chaos that emerged from the Arab spring in countries like Libya prompted a surge in drug- and weapon-smuggling to Europe, while terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels in 2015 and 2016 were mostly committed by young men of north African origin. Chatham House, a British think-tank, predicts that the security of the Strait of Gibraltar, which divides Spain from Morocco, will become increasingly fraught.

EU leaders met in Salzburg on September 19th and 20th to discuss new border controls and north African “disembarkation platforms” where migrants from the south could be processed and sent back. The summit epitomised a strategy that Mr Smith dubs “Fortress Europe”, which involves reducing migration from north Africa at almost any human cost, letting in merely a trickle of approved African migrants, bickering over who should accommodate them and then, as recompense, funnelling modest aid into Africa. Angela Merkel promotes a “Marshall Plan for Africa”, as a means of reducing migration. That reckons without the fact that economic development will raise migration numbers.

The scramble for Europe
There is an alternative “Eurafrica” strategy, writes Mr Smith. This is to accept the integration of Africa and Europe. Alex de Waal, an Africa expert at Tufts University, agrees that is the only realistic course. “The logic of history is a European-Mediterranean market that will cross the Sahara, too,” he says. “The challenge is to recognise that reality and make it a mutually beneficial and regulated one. Building walls will not work.” This, so he contends, means increasing Europe’s role as a supporter of, and model for, a multilateral Africa: backing blocs, based on the EU, which are either continental (such as the African Union) or regional (like the East African Community and the Economic Community of West African States).

It also means creating regulated routes for migrants travelling in both directions. Over the century, European districts that today have a Eurafrican character—parts of Barcelona, Marseille, Brussels and London, say—will become more the norm than the exception. “African migrants will provide a significant part of the European workforce, so we need to ask what part of the workforce and what sort of training we need to provide,” says Mr de Waal. African music and food will become more prominent in European cultural and culinary diets. Meanwhile Lagos, Casablanca, Nairobi and Kinshasa would receive their own influxes of European businesses, politicians and fortune-seekers.

The two options, Fortress Europe versus Eurafrica, may one day end up as a choice between denial and reality. Europe cannot insulate itself from the dramatic long-term shifts in its continental neighbour. Like it or not, Eurafrica is part of Europe’s demographic and cultural destiny. It is better, surely, not to ignore or reject this but to work out how to make it a success.

You don't know how access to entire shelves of non-fiction books about modern Western history and culture, including its modern social movements in the LGB arena would help you there?

&gt;I don't think i would try to learn it ""just because"" in a library

You would learn it if you intended to make use of it by travelling abroad, wouldn't you?

&gt;Also having a public library did not stop a lot of kids from ruining their lives.

Neither does the internet.

&gt;I've seen fully wasted 7 year old kids asking for a cigarette, plenty of middle schoolers that already tried hard drugs (""bath salt""), 12 year old girls sucking off high schoolers for beer etc.

Where do people increasingly coordinate drug purchases and where do kids mostly get exposed to the act of blowjobs? Have libraries ever been at fault for making those acts more commonplace? Would replacing most kids' time on the internet with visits to the library not potentially reduce this?

&gt;That's also why seeing ""free access to the outdoors and he'll become a far more capable adult"" felt so ridiculous to me

I personally don't understand where they were going with that either. I guess they meant ""unrestricted access"", meaning parents who don't give a shit if their 13 year-old comes home at 2am on weekends.

As for the list above. I find it hilarious that the British rebate is presented as some sort of perk. The EU was ripping us off mightily on the fees, and everyone knew it. Since joining, we've given the EU a net sum of £132 billion which we could have spent at home, and in return Britain now hosts four of the poorest regions in Western Europe.

3972,"There is a German paratrooper song commemorating the same occasion as this memorial: [Auf Kreta im Sturm und im Regen/On Crete in storm and in rain](https://www.volksliederarchiv.de/auf-kreta-im-sturm-und-im-regen/)

It contains the lines

    Auf Kreta da flattern unsre Fahnen,
    Wir Fallschirmjäger haben doch gesiegt,
    Und sind auch so viele gefallen,
    Der Ruhm der Fallschirmjäger aber blieb.

    On Crete, our banners are waving,
    We paratroopers were still victorious,
    And even if so many fell,
    The glory of the paratroopers remains.


Another one is simply called [""Fallschirmjägerlied""/Paratrooper song](http://ingeb.org/Lieder/hinterdb.html) (also known by the incipit ""Hinter den Bergen strahlet die Sonne"") and the refrain also commemorates Crete:

    Narvik, Rotterdam, Korinth
    Und das heiße Kreta sind
    Stätten unserer Siege!

    Narvik, Rotterdam, Corinth
    And the hot Crete are
    Places of our victories!

Interestingly enough, after the battles at Monte Cassino in 1944, the second line of this refrain was altered to:

    Kreta und Cassino sind

    Crete and Cassino are

As you can see, the airborne invasion of Crete played an important role in the traditions of the German paratroopers and was a really famous campaign at the time. Even with the Bundeswehr of today, who rejects the notion of building on the traditions of the Wehrmacht or Reichswehr, some of these songs are still known and maybe sung and people interested in military history know about the Battle of Crete for the en masse deployment of paratroopers.

Simple is better. All net contributors should fund the EU on a similar per capita value basis. Those funds should be used to run the EU, provide subsidies to critical security infrastructure and to stabilise the geographical Europe via investment. 

The UK should not receive a rebate because it doesn’t value agriculture. The UK makes significant wealth via products and services, which is its focus. These are less critical than food, energy and infrastructure and so do not deserve as high a subsidy.

I am sure that for a big European publishing houses e.g. Springer or RTL/Bertelsmann are happy with this proposal, it gives them a European tool to defend content they distribute. But look at it from the view of a small content creator, with this legislation a creator can more easily prevent works from being free-booted onto different platforms.

&gt;it impedes on freedom of expression

Not really. The lack of Fair Use laws in Europe impedes on the freedom of expression. If Article 13 gets implemented then it just gives copyright holders a way to pursue the existing copyright laws of their country. If you want to make it legal in Finland to use someone else's content without prior permission to make a comment, criticism, parody or news (education purposes are already allowed), then you need to change the law in Finland.

If e.g. a Finnish TV station went into an theatre and made a film of a performance without permission adds a critique and displayed it on television, then the performers could sue and the TV station would be in the wrong. If an American Youtube vblogger films it and adds a critique to it then according to US Fair Use it would be allowed, but it still goes against the Finnish copyright law. The impediment on freedom of expression does not change.

The proposal does not force EU countries to prohibit commentary, criticism, parody, news reporting, research, ect... most EU countries already have prohibited that.",,/r/europe/comments/9hye1f/the_gutenberg_statue_in_straßburg_censored_by/e6gdyhj/,StoneColdCrazzzy,1537649330

Well I learnt something new. But I’ve never heard those words used at all. Sorry if people have called you that. 

&gt;And since when can nicknames not be offensive? I reiterate, when dealing with other cultures it isn't just about what is or isn't offensive in your own culture, you gotta take everyone else's sensitivities into account as well, especially when talking about them directly.

Of course they can be offensive, but they shouldn’t be taken at face value. It’s like calling your friend a fucking idiot after he spills his drink. You don’t *genuinely* think he’s a fucking idiot. I personally wouldn’t ever call someone a frog/kraut unless I had some form of close friendship with them, as, like you say, I wouldn’t be sure how they would take it and wouldn’t want to piss someone off if they didn’t get it. 

&gt; Arguably deserved. Obviously these aren't directed to the UK as a whole, they're talking about Brexiteers and political leaders unable to control the direction of your country, making things worse for everyone inside and outside of the UK.

I’m openly critical of our governments handling of brexit. But the last few days the tone on here has definitely changed into one of general insults and it isn’t pleasant to read.

Nobody besides India even has the clout to push for one. Plus Pakistan would lose their shit if India got a permanent UNSC seat and they didn't.

The trial is conducted after the phase of instruction is finished. It is often carried out by a court with several members. The court may and will direct the trial in the sensse of trying to determine the truth from the evidentiary base the parties bring forth, and is not a mere witness, but they cannot have been involved with the phase of instruction.

&gt; Radical islamists (or people like you, maybe) might follow a disastrous ideology, but they (and you) are normal humans after all.

No they're not. You think these people are just criminals or terrorists, you define it as a ""crime"" or ""terrorism"", they don't. To them it's not a ""disastrous ideology"" but duty to Allah, like giving to the needy. They are soldiers man, do you know what a soldier in war is? They are at war with you, your countries or rather every country where Allah's religion doesn't rule is territory of war ([Dar al Harb](https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Dar_al-Harb) - you can look up the term, means territory of war), civilians like your wife and daughter dining in a restaurant aren't innocent civilians, they are ""harbi"", or infidels, they rejected Allah's religion and therefore they are the greatest aggressors, the enemy.    
      
As a western liberal, you don't understand any of these terms. And if you're disgusted I don't care. I'm telling you what's what with these people. To you, battlefield is where uniformed male combatants fight. To them the world is a battlefield and everyone in it are part of it. It's in their user manual.       
     
&gt;The only thing that can help in the long run is education.     
     
Yeah, I knew this was coming. It's not going to help, long or short run, besides in the long run you will lose this war with this kind of mentality. Look man, I come from a muslim country where Islam is as soft as possible, I know how these people see the world and are brought up in their family and their community from a very young age like you don't. They will reject your (infidels') indoctrination, it's satan's message to them, you really don't understand. For a while they'll act like they're buying it until it's time to strike. And punishment for apostasy is death, by the way..        
    
You can't educate them just as you can't educate enemy soldiers and spies. Would you try to educate Russian soldiers and spies if you went to war with Russia. This is the same, just assymmetrical. They come in plain clothes, and they use every opportunity to radicalize/brainwash and recruit people to their ranks, like Russian spies recruiting double agents, think of it that way.. And if other normal inmates don't convert and join them, they must pay them extra tax, or [jizya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya).    

Just as you don't place enemy soldiers from the battlefield or enemy assassins or spies in prisons with general population, you keep these separate as well. They can still have their human rights there (meals, showers, work out time, shop from the canteen, get books, etc whatever normal inmates are getting) as enemy soldiers and spies in separate prisons and away from the general population who aren't like them.    
     
In fact, many countries also separate terrorists from the general population. It doesn't mean they have to sit in mud and sleep in feces.

4174,"In Civil Law rules are often not that strict and specific so judges do not have to be completely soulless because ""it's the law"". Usually Civil Law defines some ranges of possible punishments that are at the judge's disposal e.g. imprisonment time from x years to y years, a fine anywhere from sum of x to y, etc., on the top of that imprisonment can often be changed to probation if it is the first offense, etc. So, of course, someone who was starving and stole a bread will have to be found guilty but the judge can consider the circumstances and sentence this person to probation only. In Common Law someone might have stolen a bread in 1400AD, was found guilty and sent to prison for 3 years, and today a judge cannot do anything but send a starving person to prison because of some 600 years old ruling.",,/r/europe/comments/9hyles/origins_of_civil_law_systems_in_europe/e6g7bwv/,streamofstars,1537642682

I get the feeling that people think their national culture or strength gets diminished by being a part of the Union.  It is, then, very easy for nationalistic movements to  pop up and propose to 'take back' their own culture or regain their 'former' strength--we can do without those pesky bureaucrats and those crippling rules. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is obviously not the case, the EU is a very good thing for its memberstates. It would be worth it even if not every country is better off individually-- just the fact that we can combine ourselves and become a goliath in the global economy is a big (and necessary) benefit.

I see there's a detailed [Swedish presentation comparing and debating introducing written rules for judges behavior in Sweden (Web only)](http://slidegur.com/doc/4913857/l%C3%A4s-h%C3%A4r---johan-hirschfeldt).

In Norway the ethical rules were formalized in 2007 [(PDF in English)](https://www.domstol.no/globalassets/upload/da/internett/domstol.no/domstoladministrasjonen/internasjonalt/ethical-principles-for-the-proper-conduct-of-norwegian-judges.pdf).

- The document laid down key principles for judicial behavior, no ethical rule set have been established for judges
- The purpose of the principles is more limited than the proposal for ethical rules because the principles do not aim to form the basis for the Supervisory Committee's disciplinary treatment
- The principles do not contain conditions that are regulated in the procedural law
- The principles do not include matters of labor law

The working group that developed the principles performed a comparative analysis and [wrote in their report (PDF in Norwegian)](https://www.domstol.no/globalassets/upload/da/internett/domstol.no/om-domstolene/utkast-etiske-prinsipper.pdf):

""In Sweden, Olaus Petri's Judge Rules from the 1540s are still included in new editions of Sweden's Laws (*Sveriges Rikes Lag*). The majority of the rules have such an age-old character that they can hardly give particularly practical guidance under today's conditions. The Swedish Judges' Federation issued a draft ethical in 1995 rules for judges for consultation with all courts and some other consultation bodies. The draft, which included just a limited number of themes, did not get any general endorsement, and did not result in any further work.

4290,"The Vatican and the Chinese government signed an agreement on the appointment of bishops in China, ending a decadeslong struggle over who chooses the leaders of Catholicism in the world’s most populous country, but leaving major tensions in their relationship unresolved.

The “provisional agreement” was signed Saturday in Beijing by Msgr. Antoine Camilleri, the Holy See’s undersecretary for relations with states, and Wang Chao, China’s deputy minister for foreign affairs, the Vatican said in a statement.

Details of the agreement weren’t made public, but people familiar with the matter ahead of the signing said that it allows the pope to veto new nominees for bishops proposed by the Chinese government.

“This is not the end of a process. It’s the beginning,” said the Vatican spokesman, Greg Burke, in a statement. “The objective of the accord is not political but pastoral, allowing the faithful to have bishops who are in communion with Rome but at the same time recognized by Chinese authorities.”

China’s foreign ministry released a brief statement, affirming that “China and the Vatican will continue to maintain communications, to push forward the continued improvement of bilateral relations.”

The controversial deal constitutes the first official recognition by the Communist government that the pope is the head of the Catholic Church in China.

But the agreement also means that the Vatican will no longer approve the ordination of bishops in China without Beijing’s permission, meaning that all new leaders of the Catholic hierarchy there will be men acceptable to an avowedly atheist government.

Coming amid an intensified government crackdown on Christians and other religious groups in China, the deal has thus drawn protests, including from some Catholics there, that it represents a defeat for the principle of religious freedom.

On Saturday, Cardinal Joseph Zen, a former bishop of Hong Kong and vociferous critic of the Vatican’s rapprochement with Beijing who has denounced the imminent deal as a betrayal of Chinese Catholics, complained of the lack of detail on the deal. “The government can tell the Catholics: ‘Obey to us! We are in agreement with your pope!’” the cardinal said in a statement. “Trust, accept and obey without knowing what to accept, what to obey?”

For Beijing, the agreement is a boost to its image as the Communist party pursues a campaign to bring Catholicism and other faiths under its control.

It is also a step toward resumption of diplomatic relations with the Vatican, which Beijing broke off in 1951, and hence part of an intensifying campaign for the isolation of Taiwan, a democratic, self-ruled island that Beijing considers a renegade province. The Holy See is the most prestigious of Taiwan’s diplomatic partners, which now number only 17 after Beijing peeled off three others this year.

Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that it had received the Vatican’s assurance that the agreement on bishops “will not affect the diplomatic relationship” between Taipei and the Holy See.

Some Chinese officials worry that the deal sets a dangerous precedent by giving a foreign organization a measure of power over religious affairs in China. They fear that it could encourage other religious groups in China—including Protestants, Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists—to seek greater integration with global religious bodies.

China’s estimated 10 million Catholics are legally supposed to worship only in churches approved by the state-controlled Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, but many Catholics attend unregistered churches in so-called underground communities led by bishops loyal only to Rome. Pope Francis’ pursuit of the deal has largely reflected his desire to end divisions between those two groups.

In a statement on the agreement, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state, said the pope was calling on Catholics in China to “make concrete gestures of reconciliation among themselves, and so overcome past misunderstandings, past tensions, even recent ones.”

Although the Vatican and Beijing have cooperated informally to agree on most appointments of bishops in recent decades, the government has periodically named bishops without the pope’s approval. China had been threatening to restart unilateral appointments of state-backed bishops, placing pressure on the Vatican to come to an agreement.

Beijing’s major condition for the agreement was that the pope recognize seven excommunicated Chinese bishops who had been appointed without Vatican approval over the years. On Saturday, the Vatican announced that the pope had fulfilled the requirement.

In two of the seven cases, government-backed bishops are to take the place of bishops who have shunned government control—the first time the Vatican has asked so-called underground bishops to step aside for this purpose.

“Today, for the first time, all the bishops in China are in communion with the bishop of Rome, with the successor of Peter,” Cardinal Parolin said.

People familiar with the matter said ahead of the signing that the provisional agreement allows for the possibility of revisions after one or two years if either party sees the need.

Wang Meixiu, a professor and expert on Sino-Vatican relations at the state-affiliated Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the deal was a landmark for China’s government, as it was a recognition that the Catholic church in China was part of the universal church.

“It no longer holds the old slogan that China church affairs are the sovereignty of the state,” she said.

But she said it remained to be seen how the deal would affect the lives of Chinese Catholics.

Among the important unknown details about the agreement are whether the pope will have a choice of nominees or merely a right of veto over a single candidate at a time; and how thoroughly the Vatican will be able to vet bishop candidates ahead of time.

The agreement also leaves unresolved the fate of some 30 so-called underground bishops recognized by the Vatican but not by China.

Another complication is a major discrepancy in the number of dioceses recognized by the two sides. The Vatican tallied 144 Catholic dioceses in the country by the end of 2017, while the Chinese government’s count was only 96, according to the Holy Spirit Study Center. On Saturday, the Vatican announced that the pope was recognizing a new diocese Chengde, which the Chinese government had established in 2010 for excommunicated Bishop Guo Jincai, one of the seven newly recognized. That would bring the Vatican’s count to 145. It is unclear whether Beijing will nominate bishops to lead the dioceses it hasn’t recognized till now.",Ligurian in Utrecht,/r/europe/comments/9i17hp/vatican_and_china_sign_deal_over_bishops_allowing/e6g01sp/,BkkGrl,1537635699

That isn’t the problem, it is due to internal issues, the lead up and aftermath of the 2008 crisis as well as mistaken policy decisions, following that. All this is divisive rhetoric that doesn’t help anyone and there are clearly better explanation. At this point, cementing such narratives have more harm than the said effect of them. It is funny how quick people like to resort to the blame game when the euro is involved but wouldn’t do it in other circumstances. I mean you wouldn’t  say South Africa has high unemployment because Johannesburg is too strong. It is not about what it would be otherwise, Germany is just one region of a wider area so it is about improving local economic conditions. It is not at the expense of one or the other but more like a level playing field and the countries in it need to find out what they are doing wrong, rather than blaming others.

Yes because the idea isn’t to blame but the bad execution of it.

&gt;People always harp on how unpredictable the financial crisis was, as if that excuses being unprepared for a recession. 

No one can predict the timing or the extent of it, of course these things tend to follow boom and bust cycles but that is little indication. The euro at the time was a completely untried idea and at the time  was considered a work in progress so nobody could have realistically predicted how it would have faired. The stability growth pact tried but it got quite a few things wrong, they also created other institutions like starting the banking union, to ensure stability.

In civil law, the judge reads out the findings of the police. Then the lawyers each comment on that. The judge goes in depth with the data at hand and the lawyers are basically just there to talk to the judge and ask him ""hey but can't it be seen as manslaughter instead of murder because XY?"" then the judge decides what the crime was, opens his book of law and looks at the respective laws for that crime, which usually includes possible punishments.

All I said is Muslims have higher % of people who do gang rapes than anyone else which is a fact. 3.75% of population does 75% of a specific crime and when they do it, it's usually in much higher numbers (1400 girls Rotherham) so you are looking at about 50:1 ratio of Asian-nonAsian men who do gang rapes if we are counting the number of victims.

You also ignore many of the drawbacks, while yes there is a small export advantage it comes at the expense of other things like purchasing power and makes imports more expensive. It is also not the only reason why companies invest in certain places neither the only way to reduce costs. As being in a monetary union removes exchange risks saying what it would be if they had their own currencies is also rather meaningless.

Besides Italy is the 10th largest exporter with a trade surplus so it is doing pretty well, despite the supposed disadvantage. The problem with Italy is productivy (which has been declining since the 1970s) and is not helped by the aging population.

* **To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;**

* To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion; and

4549,"That's a bit of an assumption you're making, because simultaneously, I'm one of those conscripts who was terrified of guns. First week when we got our rifles, I panicked. I broke down in the middle of practice, cried in front of everyone, was pulled aside by our instructor, went up to the boss to sign up for unarmed service, because at that moment I was so scared of that gun... And then I waited a few days and thought about it before putting my name on that paper. Because in the end a rifle is a tool. A sinister, terrifying tool, but it has no spirit, no soul, no intention. It kills, but it also saves lives. It's just an object, what matters is the man pulling the trigger. I've gotten over much of my fear of weapons, because we are trained well. I broke down, but got nothing but support and respect from my squad mates and trainers. The army had specifically helped me grow as a person. This isn't the 1980's anymore. We're not bullied from the top, and we're not bullied by our peers. We talk about how we're feeling. Yes, we get challenged, but challenge is good. Challenge means growth. This past week I went three days in the forest on a total of six hours of sleep. At a point I was ready to give in, because I was so stressed, so tired, so useless. But I kept pushing, and I found that I wasn't quite at my limit. Sure, I cried while digging a foxhole at midnight in the dark, but in the morning I looked at that foxhole and thought ""damn, I've made a mighty fine shelter for myself"".  I'm glad I didn't give up. People tend to focus on the negatives of military service, because it definitely involves a lot of being in a hurry to wait, or some pointlessly strict rules, and every company has some asshole on a power trip for a lance corporal. Just like every workplace has some insufferable manager, or a landlord is very strict with what you can or cannot do with the apartment, or you have a lazy roommate. It's good practice for what comes ahead in life. The average 18-19 year old goes from living with their parents into the military. You learn a little independence. Cleaning our room every day can be a pain, and sometimes the places where the officers find dust are pretty ridiculous, but at the same time I know that if we don't clean the whole squad will get sick. Teaches responsibility. Teaches how to get along with all sorts of people, because you don't choose who you work with. But I think most importantly, military service gives a lot of young guys positive affirmations and experiences of succeeding either as an individual or as a group. 

Not to say that there aren't bad times. People quit. People get injured. Some people get bored out of their minds, and some people get bullied. It's the same in society at large. The military is not a world completely severed from the rest of Finnish society, it's an extension and reflection of it. Do I think it would be beneficial to have more women in the service? Heck yes. It remains a very homogeneous environment, though the inclusion of first-generation Finns brings welcome diversity. It's a strategic error to leave half the population out of the loop on national defence. In the previous wars we fought, the women were involved on both the home front and the front, just not in combat. Now we recognize that women are just as valuable soldiers as men. There definitely needs to be something of a ""security course"" to support the military side. I think a one-year course on living in a crisis, identifying disinformation, civic duties and such which was an alternative to the military service and mandatory for all would be a welcome addition. We just need a gov't that wants to make it happen, and a little extra GDP to fund such a project.

As it stands, in Finland we enter into a social contract which treats men and women unequally in the scope of national security. Is this unfair? Sure it is. But as it stands, security comes before equality for me. It's unfair, but I prefer Finland as is, to a Finland which suffers the fate of Georgia, Ukraine, or Moldova.

4559,"alright sorry for the waiting but I had personal stuff to do, ok so first off all, i have to say that i misunderstood your first question, you were asking, just how exactly was the EU involved in the migrant crisis, in your opinion this had nothing to do with the EU and my answer to you had nothing to do with the EU involment on it, but how bad the migrant flux into europe was, so i wanted to apologize for that, but i do believe that the EU is to blame for the migrant crisis, not for it's origins (Libya and Syria) but for the way they dealt with it, like i said, and I'm sure you agree, the EU forced refugee quotas on member states, now you might say that was good but some EU member states disagree with you, they didn't want refugees and that's why those people are pissed, that was my first point in this conversation, so the EU was clearly involved for better or worse, then we have the schengen agreement which is an integral part of the EU, not exclusive to EU member states, where the outside borders of the schengen must be protected, they clearly failed at that, they were supposed to deport all migrants that were not refugees, but the EU clearly failed to stop them because southern countries like Spain, Italy and Greece were in a hard financial situations and they lacked the resources to deal with it, in the first years of the crisis migrants had free open way into Germany and Sweden, without asking asylum in the countries they first went throw because those countries in the north provided way better payments and under the geneva convention that's NOT something that a refugee as the right to (shop for a country with better payments), , they still can't process the asylum requests fast enough and they fail to deport the ones that aren't even refugees, most of them aren't and many of them fake stuff to get refugee status, so  that was clearly a failure to enforce the external border of the Schengen area, you might say that Greece Italy and Spain were the true culprits for this, but if they fail to do it, it concerns every other schengen area member and they should have helped them deal with it, that was an EU problem because schengen is an EU thing. and i know you'll say, they tried to help by imposing refugee quotas on every other EU member, but that still didn't stop the flux of illegal migrants into europe that came along mixed in with refugees. that took a while to fix. now in the last part of our conversation i suggested that helping them (refugees) in nearby countries was a better option if we wanted this problem to stop and you said well the EU doesn't have the power to do that, and you're usually against giving EU more power over their members, but if you say that then you can't defend the EU imposing quotas, they didn't have that power either. and as far as helping them in those countries it doesn't have to be an EU effort, it can be the UN, individual countries, Germany already did an agreement with turkey over that because this was a political issue for Merkel. BUT i would be in favor of the EU doing that? Yes i would, i think one of the basic functions of governaments is to protect their citizens, borders are a crucial part of that and the EU has the schengen agreement so it makes borders an EU issue, not just a national issue. this would help solve the migrant crisis which poses a security threat to EU citizens in my opinion (as I explained in other comments). and it doesn't give the EU that much power anyway, you just need a budget to do this, and you would be paying for those refugees anyway, so why not pay them there throw an EU fund when that makes it 2 to 10 times cheaper? also it doesn't pose any security issues for EU citizens like bringing them here would, so that's my opinion.

edit:I forgot to mention that in this scenario I wouldn't want to ignore the geneva agreement, there's certainly people with more radical views on that, but i think that is going a little too far.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/9h33n7/splitting_wedges/e6fhu6h/,Viriathus552,1537613575

Gaza is in a strategically irrelevant position. If they withdraw from West bank, they're in an extremely vulnerable position because of how strategically important West bank is; rocket fire from West bank can reach any point in Israel with ease and there's no reason to believe it wouldn't happen. The only thing preventing Hamas from overrunning West bank and using it as a staging ground for further attacks is constant presence of the IDF.

4671,"I am not taking a stance on Catalonian independence either way but the situation in Catalonia is not comparable to Palestinian situation at all.

All Catalonians have the Spanish citizenship and live in Spain even if many do not want to be a part of the country.

They are by law Spanish citizens with complete freedom of movement and they can do what other Spanish citizens can do. They can travel around the world. They are tried in civilian courts and judged by civilian law. They receive mail using the same service without any military power stopping the mail. They don't have segregated roads. They don't have to visit a checkpoint when going from one city in Catalonia to another city in Catalonian.


Palesitnians on the other hand live without citizenship on any state, are de facto stateless and under a brutal military occupation. They can't travel from a Palestinian city to another without Israeli military checkpoints. They can't use the mail without Israeli approval. They are judged by Israeli military law if Israel arrests them. 

If a Palestinian and an Israeli child get in a fight in the West Bank then the Israeli child will go free or rarely be tried in a civilian court with due process. The Palestinian child can be thrown in jail without any trial for an extended period of time and then judge by a kangaroo Israeli military court.

Again this is not in opposition or support of Catalan independence but the two situations are in no way comparable.

4678,"Sicilians once spoke a language that evolved from Maghreb Arabic spoken in North Africa. Whilst in Sicily Siculo-Arabic died out and was replaced with the Latin-based Sicilian, most of the original Maltese inhabitants came from Sicilian regions such as Agrigento and Caltanisetta where this language was spoken widely. As they never became part of Italy, the language was retained.

&amp;#x200B;

Modern Maltese was formed when the Siculo-Arabic (Semitic) speakers from the countryside started to intermarry with the Latin-speakers who formed the vast majority of towns, especially around the Grand Harbour. Many of them were Genoese, Venetian and other Italian merchants. Eventually the languages merged to what is now Maltese. Over time other 'visitors' settled on the island (French in small numbers, but the British quite significantly and the Knights brought a great many Greeks from Rhodes etc with them).

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why you can't understand spoken Maltese as much is due to the core words being Semitic in origin. However modern Maltese is 40-50% Italian or Sicilian and 10-15% English, with smaller French and Spanish influences (e.g. the word for hello is bongu - pronounced quite similarly to bonjour).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a little sample from Wikipedia:

&amp;#x200B;

L-**Unjoni** hija mibnija fuq il-**valuri** ta' **rispett** għad-**dinjità** tal-bniedem, ta' **libertà**, ta' **demokrazija**, ta' **ugwaljanza**, ta' l-**istat** tad-**dritt** u tar-**rispett** għad-**drittijiet** tal-bniedem, **inklużi** d-**drittijiet** ta' **persuni** li jagħmlu **parti** minn **minoranzi**.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps some are harder to work out due to the different spelling (e.g. dritt is dritto in Italian, dinjita is dignita) but you get the idea.

&gt; [...] we like to make sure that the law applies to all of us.

Is this actually true, though? The application of any law leaves a lot of discretion to prosecutors, and vague laws with lots of positives especially.

Going by the article, Le Pen is being investigated because she shared ISIS videos with captions of how horrible they are. That action alone would probably render tens of thousands of French people as suspects. Add in all the violent rhetoric on the internet and you could probably investigate millions of French people, maybe even a majority of ~~FN~~ RN supporters.

So why her? Were her tweets especially hateful? Unless the French are a lot more civilized than Anglophone comments under ISIS videos, the contrary seems true.

The likely explanation to me seems to be that her tweets have more impact. But her tweets have more impact because she is not an ordinary citizen, but a representative and politician.

4793,"With the enormous growth of capitalism and industrialisation in the 19th century, there was a huge demand of workers. They had to be accommodated close to the factories, i.e. in the city and not on the outskirts.

In Ghent (Belgium, my hometown), workers were housed in small *beluiken*. These were small houses (one or two rooms) which housed a whole family. There were no sewers (garbage and ordure were sometimes just thrown out in the streets), whole families lived, slept and ate in the same room, etc. The houses were often not visible from the street but you could access the street/courtyard with the *beluiken* when you passed a small arch or a door.

Essentially she's asking for a customs union for Northern Ireland and the option for the UK to have full control of its own customs for her ""take back the border"" voters, and has language that say ""don't worry, we'll make sure to collect EU tariffs on things going to the EU and we'll be keeping the books to make sure it's done right""

It's absurd. It's basically giving the UK near total control over EU tariffs as anyone wanting to import anything would just ship it to the UK, sell it to a middle man and ship it over to Europe with zero checks because oh look, customs union.

It's been pointed out multiple times but apparently, because the UK press only wrote about objections from inside her own party, ours never happened.

The EU has shown no willpower to defend external borders in Southern/Mediterranean Europe nor in Eastern Europe with them entirely relying upon Poland to man the gates. 

If they do decide to finally enforce any form of an external border, it'll be pure and unfiltered evidence of the EU doing something to spite/punish the British/Irish people. If the EU does attempt to do this with some form of border force (like that one they've recently suggested eh?) then I'd imagine they'd feel the full brunt of unrest which would inevitable stop them. 

My belief is that none of this will happen, no border will be put up by either side and the entire issue will be entirely realised to have been a non-issue at which point the UK will begin negotiating an FTA with the EU or RoI will simply tell the EU that the border is being watched (when in reality it's not) and a FTA will then be negotiated.

5191,"&gt;I'd recommend speaking with people who actually work for the Finnish Defence Forces, you'll find that there's perfectly good arguments to defend it with. To name the two main ones:

&gt;Economics. It's expensive to train an entire age-group. It's cheaper to train about one third of an age group than to train it in its entirety

Obviously, but there are other options than training the entire age group or just men (or more precisely ~80% of men). Training 40% of an entire age-group selected based on motivation, mental health and physical properties shouldn't be much more expensive than forcing all men to do the job.

&gt;Necessity. To support the previous point, the commanders of the Finnish Defence Forces have a strategy for defence and deterrence, and they know roughly how many people need to be trained. There is no point in conscripting more than the necessary number.

Exactly, and since not all men want to serve the military, why not let more motivated women step in? In a country as patriotic as Finland, the defence forces should have no problem in getting the necessary amount of conscripts from those who are at least motivated enough to not actively oppose the system. This of course, assuming that the conscription, pr and all kinds of other advertising is targeted to everyone, not just the male 50% of an age group. This would create savings as those who oppose wouldn't have to be isolated from the society into prisons or often more or less useless civilian service that doesn't really bring the government any taxes or help raise the GDP.",,/r/europe/comments/9hq7fc/finnish_government_proposes_scrapping_jehovahs/e6ep1gd/,Jussipsi42,1537571139

Macron was running against a bunch of people who all had a lot of popular support and came out first. No french presidential election has been that tight since... forever?

Of course, Le Pen would be among the two finalists, and of course she would lose (unless her opponent was Mélenchon). The real deal was ""who will be facing her?"". It wasn't Fillon, it wasn't Mélenchon. It was Macron, a guy who had no party behind him, had been a (quite unpopular) member of the last government, was young and perhaps gay in a country that likes to elect old farts who cheat on their wife. So no, he didn't get elected just because he faced Le Pen. He faced all the other, and beat them. By a fair margin.

5326,"&gt; a no deal scenario would immediately imply a hard border

That's not really true. 

In a no deal scenario, the UK cannot be compelled to create a border if they do not volunteer to do it. And we have heard that they intend not to do it whether there's a deal or not.

So the question is what will Ireland do? 

I have said this before, but I cannot foresee any Irish govt volunteering to build a 'hard border' across NI. In the past we have put up with such a border from the UK, resolving to use the GFA agreement as a democratic means to sort out the problem. But dealing with the UK's border is a completely different animal to building and policing it ourselves. 

In the same way that May does not want to be the PM who 'cut the UK in half', our Taoiseach Varadkar does not want to be the Taoiseach who further partitioned the island by building a border we've been trying to eliminate.

5352,"No, it's really not. The EU is actually the world's leading regulatory power. No other state has as much influence on global standards as the EU does, which is called the ""Brussels effect"". See [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a97ng/how_the_eu_uses_its_global_influence_to_protect/) for more details.

-

&gt; ""Contrary to traditional contours of influence, the Brussels Effect captures a phenomenon where the EU does not have to do anything except regulate its own market to exercise global regulatory power""

-

&gt; ""Without resorting to international institutions or seeking other nations' cooperation, the EU is able to promulgate regulations that become entrenched in the legal frameworks of developed and developing markets alike, leading to the ""Europeanization"" of important aspects of global commerce.""

-

&gt; ""Conflicts over regulatory power rarely elevate to the political level. Trade is a much less controversial way of pursuing foreign policy objectives, in particular when the EU can always, in principle, offer the choice of not complying with its rules. Subscribing to EU rules is the price of trading with Europe. All the EU is doing is exercising its right to protect its own consumers. This is a less controversial position to take compared to a regime change pursued in the name of laudable goals such as democracy or human rights. Thus, in falling between coercion and cooperation, regulatory power strikes a balance of legitimacy and potency that makes it a more efficacious option than its alternatives.""

-

&gt; ""Few Americans are aware that EU Regulations determine the makeup they apply in the morning, the cereal they eat for breakfast, the software they use on their computer, and the privacy settings they adjust on their Facebook page. And that’s just before 8.30 A.M. EU regulations also dictate what kind of air conditioners Americans use to cool their homes and why their children no longer find soft plastic toys in the McDonald’s Happy Meals.""

No. You are an idiot who thinks that he understands something.

You couldn't even pronounce the names of the authors who wrote books on the subject I read because they are not in English. But I am anxious to find out how regardless of that they were ""neo-confederates"" because that's the only thing your tiny brain can comprehend.

Slavery was not the issue. Slavery was one of the constituent elements of the issue. The issue was clearly too complex for someone like you to understand.

Slavery did not cause the war. The war was caused by secession.

South seceded because they were losing political power. That would lead to their opponents using political power to weaken their political and economic wealth through regulation abolishing slavery. The fight for power is tied to the money which the power can affect.

Article 50 states it is an 'intention' to leave.

If the EU has no means of kicking a member out against its will. The UK is still a member and changes its mind, there is no EU law available to kick them out.

5548,"&gt;And the majority of people supporting a law doesn't mean the law is valid.

So, in a democratic country, to you, the population shouldn't have any power, because Americans know better, because Germans know better, because Swedish know better, so why would the French decide their law as they're ~~probably~~ wrong ? I mean at that point, why have countries, just take Trump, make him God of Planet Earth and voilà, no more issues, no more dictatorships, no more slavery, no more racism, no more anything bad, it would be a true utopia... or maybe not ?

&amp;#x200B;

When we say to the Americans that gun control should be a thing from our point of view, when we tell them that death penalty isn't okay to us, it's always the same answer : ""who the fuck are they ? They're so smog, we know better"". And then when it comes to European politics, when they tell us what we should do, it sounds a lot like ""who the fuck are they ? They're so stupid, we know better"". Of course the Americans are right and the rest of mankind is wrong, that's how it has always be since the birth of the one and only fathers of freedom and equality and everything that's always been good on this planet : the United States of America.

&amp;#x200B;

And really, if we just ignore cultural relativity (because it's not a thing, there is a good moral point of view on every subject and the world's population can be divided between those who know the Truth and those who don't, amen), what you really saying is that we should be at war with 95% of mankind (because let's face it, the only way to change their political systems in a pretty fast way is an invasion). Of course we should eradicate most political system (and by extension, brain wash those who dare to believe that we're wrong) of the middle east, and Russia, and China, and for that matter, most South-American, African or Asian political systems aren't that great either so we should probably go invade and genocide over there. Earth should be us and nothing else, because we know, we have philosophy, history, moral, politics, ethics, civilization and they don't.

&amp;#x200B;

It's colonization time all over again, let's make a blood bath out of the inferior and barbaric monkeys and let the one and only kind of humans worth calling ""mankind"" rise again. And then when we're done we'll realize that there's also stupid, inferior and barbaric monkeys in our society, so it will be blood bath time again...

&amp;#x200B;

There's a difference between ""I find their idea disgusting"" and ""they're stupid and we need to convince them, by force if necessary, to change"". Do I agree with what's going on in Russia, in Turkey, in China, in Saudi Arabia or in America ? No. Do I think Russia should change because a guy in France disagree with them ? No, because at that point, that would mean that they're just a puppet state and I am their true leader, which isn't the case. You can't at the same time agree with the idea that people should rule themselves and require that they obey you, these are two opposite ideas, either you support people's right to govern themselves, or you don't.

5581,"While some countries have very limited freedom of speech, it isn't something we should strive to. I can openly read and discuss i.e. Mein Kampf or Das Kapital if I want to. I can also discuss the merit of the ideas in either book, there is nothing wrong with it. In fact if you want to explain to someone why communism or nazism is wrong, how else would you do it then by understanding and refuting their arguments. Of course this is wildly different from i.e. calling to action, or arguing for violence or revolution, which is illegal pretty much everywhere (and for good reason, as it is not necessary in liberal and free society).

Funny enough, but similar argument could be had about 200 years ago. When some wanted freedom of speech and right to vote, while the rulling aristocracy didn't and decided to supress them. This led to the violent revolts in an attempt to change the existing system, where many of those revolts had to be violently put down.

And again, after all this time, there are many people, including you, who argue for censure, to silence their opposition and opress anyone who has different opinion then themselves. 

This should never happen in democracy, as it is the only system that does not requrie violence or force to enact change. As I've pointed out, you can change the system through civil discussion. However, if you disalow discussion on topics you personaly percieve as oposing or undesirable, you will only have the same demonstrations and revolts that happened in the past.

This also opens a very dangerous precedence, as someone can now argue to access to information based on the set of values they have, and you might not agree with it either.

In Discussion, two key messages are that (1) the bulk of anti-vaccination messaging does not come from recognizable bots, and (2) Russian bots do not push anti-vaxx specifically, they sow discord by pumping both sides of the issue (and general panic about infectious diseases). This somewhat legitimizes the discussion, supports false equivalence of the sides, but that's it.

Moreover, Russian bots are a bad fit in space in time. They have presence mostly on English and Slavic-language platforms. This does not explain Italy, Romania, and Belgium at all.

They're social and political views based on progress and reform, aren't they?

Progress:

1. forward or onward movement towards a destination.
2. development towards an improved or more advanced condition.

By the very definition of the word they can be described as progressive, no? Fascism significantly improved the economic condition of Germany whereas communism significantly improved the conditions of peasants and the poor strata of Russian society.

5681,"This is not entirely accurate. On the local and first level of courts, Tingsrätten, there are three politically appointed ""judges"" called nämndemän and one professional (and Law-educated) judge. Almost all of the time the nämndemän simply agree with the judge's decision and that's that. If they don't however and overrule the judge, the case is bound to get appealed to the regional second level of courts called ""Hovrätten"". Those courts consists of three professional judges and two nämndemän. Lastly in the supreme court, ""Högsta Domstolen"", there is only professional judges. 

So really the system with ""nämndemän"" is a quite silly way to shoehorn in ""democratic representation"" in the courts, though in practice it doesn't negatively affect the rule of law because of the right to appeal and the tradition of deferring to professional judges. It's also especially improbable that it would lead to anyone getting wrongfully convicted or getting a harsher crime than they otherwise would have. If this still were to happen, the sentenced person could also appeal to the ECHR, which in turn could put the Swedish court system on blast and force the necessary reforms if they consider such neccessary (the European convention is Swedish Law, right below the constitution).

5691,"&gt; without any idea about stuff besides lowering taxes, cutting welfare and being mean to non-white non-christians.

The ""being mean to non-white non-christians"" part  - meaning to massively reduce non-EU migration and to kick out the welfare migrants already in Germany - would free up A LOT of resources that could be put into other, more important fields.

22 billion per year is what the migrants cost Germany just in direct costs right now.

&gt;They deny both man-made climate change and that we are currently in a period of global warming, they want to produce the majority of german energy by nuclear fission

Good, nuclear energy is by far more environmentally friendly than the crappy coal energy that's currently in wide use. You also wouldn't have to destroy old forests for that (see Hambacher Forst).

&gt; they want to reduce taxes for everyone but more importantly impose a flat percentage while cutting welfare,

Good, more money for working people, more money for families, more money for the middle class, more work incentive for the welfare users.

&gt;they offer no solution for Germanies biggest problems like demographic change and the resulting possible collapse of the social system

That's false, you're just not willing to acknowledge their plans for it. Their plan is to encourage German families to have more children. Higher birth rates would do a lot to fix the issues of the social system.

3rd world immigration on the other hand exacerbates the problems. So the social welfare system is another field that is *massively* negatively affected by our current immigration policies.

&gt;They demand that the state-funded media stop criticising them (said media criticises every major political party) 

They also want to cut funding for the tax-funded media, so it's not really a surprise that they criticize the AfD, seeing as they'd be out of a job if they get into power.

5842,"*As requested by the Automoderator because The Economist is often paywalled, the article's text:*

It is a peculiarly modern habit to think of the Mediterranean Sea as a boundary. For over two millennia, civilisations bled across it and intermingled. Roman, Carthaginian, Moorish and Venetian empires expanded primarily along maritime routes. It took four days to get from imperial Rome to today’s Tunisia, but 11 days to reach Milan. The Sahara restricted contact between this Mediterranean Eurafrica and the regions to the south, but not entirely. A study of 22 skulls from Roman London found that four were African, for example. The medieval wealth of desert trading cities like Timbuktu and Agadez spoke of extensive north-south commerce. Later European colonialists penetrated, pillaged and parcelled up the continent; African troops fought in the trenches of the first world war; Europeans fought in Africa in the second.

Three subsequent events curbed this trans-Mediterraneanism. European powers left Africa with decolonisation; many African states sought to be neutral during the cold war; Europeans turned towards Asia’s booming markets as globalisation took hold. Tellingly, the geopolitical buzzword of the moment is “Eurasia”. Europe and Asia are integrating along old Silk Road routes, especially under China’s Belt and Road infrastructure splurge, yet “Eurafrica” remains relatively little discussed. Europe is too busy rushing into Asia’s arms to embrace a continent on its doorstep which may be even more significant in the long term.

Today’s waves of African migration are merely a prelude. Of the 2.2bn citizens added to the global population by 2050, 1.3bn will be Africans—about the size of China’s population today. And more of them will have the means to travel. Those Africans risking the trip north across the Mediterranean today are not the poorest, but those with a mobile phone to organise the trip and money to pay smugglers. Few of the Nigerians who attempt the crossing are from their country’s poor north, for example; almost all are from its wealthier south. As African countries gradually prosper, migration will surely increase, not decrease. Emmanuel Macron raised these points in a recent interview. The French president was recommending a new book, “The Rush to Europe”, published in French by Stephen Smith of Duke University, which models past international migrations like that of Mexicans into America to show that the number of Afro-Europeans (Europeans with African roots) could rise from 9m at present to between 150m and 200m by 2050, perhaps a quarter of Europe’s total population.

The interdependence is growing in other areas, too. While Europe’s old Atlantic harbours stagnate, four of its five fastest-growing ports are on the Mediterranean (led by Piraeus in Greece). Much of this is driven by Asian trade, but the African share is rising too, and will mushroom as the continent continues to grow. Europe is increasingly reliant on Nigerian and Liberian minerals, and German environmentalists dream of giant Saharan solar plants feeding clean energy to Europe. The security situation on one shore of the Mediterranean increasingly affects the other. The chaos that emerged from the Arab spring in countries like Libya prompted a surge in drug- and weapon-smuggling to Europe, while terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels in 2015 and 2016 were mostly committed by young men of north African origin. Chatham House, a British think-tank, predicts that the security of the Strait of Gibraltar, which divides Spain from Morocco, will become increasingly fraught.

EU leaders met in Salzburg on September 19th and 20th to discuss new border controls and north African “disembarkation platforms” where migrants from the south could be processed and sent back. The summit epitomised a strategy that Mr Smith dubs “Fortress Europe”, which involves reducing migration from north Africa at almost any human cost, letting in merely a trickle of approved African migrants, bickering over who should accommodate them and then, as recompense, funnelling modest aid into Africa. Angela Merkel promotes a “Marshall Plan for Africa”, as a means of reducing migration. That reckons without the fact that economic development will raise migration numbers.

The scramble for Europe

There is an alternative “Eurafrica” strategy, writes Mr Smith. This is to accept the integration of Africa and Europe. Alex de Waal, an Africa expert at Tufts University, agrees that is the only realistic course. “The logic of history is a European-Mediterranean market that will cross the Sahara, too,” he says. “The challenge is to recognise that reality and make it a mutually beneficial and regulated one. Building walls will not work.” This, so he contends, means increasing Europe’s role as a supporter of, and model for, a multilateral Africa: backing blocs, based on the EU, which are either continental (such as the African Union) or regional (like the East African Community and the Economic Community of West African States).

It also means creating regulated routes for migrants travelling in both directions. Over the century, European districts that today have a Eurafrican character—parts of Barcelona, Marseille, Brussels and London, say—will become more the norm than the exception. “African migrants will provide a significant part of the European workforce, so we need to ask what part of the workforce and what sort of training we need to provide,” says Mr de Waal. African music and food will become more prominent in European cultural and culinary diets. Meanwhile Lagos, Casablanca, Nairobi and Kinshasa would receive their own influxes of European businesses, politicians and fortune-seekers.

The two options, Fortress Europe versus Eurafrica, may one day end up as a choice between denial and reality. Europe cannot insulate itself from the dramatic long-term shifts in its continental neighbour. Like it or not, Eurafrica is part of Europe’s demographic and cultural destiny. It is better, surely, not to ignore or reject this but to work out how to make it a success.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/9hnmd9/why_europe_should_focus_on_its_growing/e6dank6/,liotier,1537520001
5843,"A hard Brexit will lead to increased barriers in trade because there won’t be free trade between the UK and EU. The various colours of the EU countries show the amount of exports to the UK, the Brits will have to pay more to import these products (mostly intermediate products) after Brexit due to increased trade barriers. The circles on the map show investments of European countries into the UK, for example the Unilever headquarters in London. It will be harder to invest in the UK because it will not fall under current EU legislation anymore after Brexit. This could lead to the relocation of business activities to other countries. As such Brexit has a negative effect on both the import into the UK and the investments that the UK receives from abroad.

If you dismantle what is necessary things for a free democratic election competition by gerrymandering the voting districts, buying off media and turning them into your propaganda, attacking judiciary and thus making yourself less likely to face consequences should you commit any crime, this argument that 'voters will just decide' becomes weaker.

Curiosity. we got production system developed by local IT, because there is 50+ branches around a world Germans (owners) come to conclusion that to cut cost all functionalities from existing  systems will be merged and one big piece of software will be created by ""the best in the world German engineers"". So far so good, we got excursion of ""dear German super humans"" which tried to determine which functionalities of their old system will be utilized and how much work will be needed to do that. They proudly presented us their existing system, 10 main products, fragmentation 2 level down, actualization twice a year with down time less than 6h. Then short, bald, glasses wearing Pole come to projector: we got 200+ contracts, loosely corresponding to German main product, some use general rules some custom made effecting in about 100 unique rules, each rule has 20 dimension, we got 23 updates last year with actualization on the fly due to utilizing backup system.
