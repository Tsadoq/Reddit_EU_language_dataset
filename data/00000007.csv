100,"RegioJet also wants to take the same route.

The Ministry of Transport has confirmed that it wants to introduce a new direct connection between Prague and the Baltic Sea coast in Poland from December 2023. It has already published a preliminary announcement in the European Public Procurement Bulletin, according to which the contract for the operation of the new R32 Prague - Wroc≈Çaw - Gdynia line on the Czech side should be awarded to Czech Railways. However, RegioJet also wants to run a commercial line on the route.

The new line has been talked about since last year, and since the beginning of the year it has been getting clearer outlines. ""The preparation of the new R32 line is proceeding as expected. A preliminary announcement has been made and the service is expected to start in December 2023,"" said a transport ministry spokesman. The contract is to be awarded by direct award without competition by ƒåD. ""We assume a direct award to the carrier ƒåesk√© dr√°hy,"" Jemelka added. The Ministry of Transport recently also informed the Pardubice Region about the plan for the new connection.

Czech Railways expects to operate the service probably earlier and in cooperation with a Polish partner as far as the Baltic Sea to Gdynia. In their February response to the planned acquisition of Siemens Vectron locomotives, they stated that they would take delivery of 7 machines by the end of October 2022 and that they would be deployed on the new line Prague - Lichkov - Wroclaw - Gdynia.

There is currently no direct rail link between Prague and Wroclaw, previously the route was operated by Leo Express. However, the line has not yet been renewed.

The line from Prague to Gdynia has also been included in the list of planned new connections of Regiojet. ""We are looking at routes where we are convinced of the possibility of operating trains in open access mode (free access of carriers, the same mode as Prague - Ostrava, ed.),"" says the company's spokesman Ale≈°l Ondr≈Øj. ""Poland is currently one of our priorities,"" Ondr≈Øj added.

138,"Her he come the misogynist.

&gt;less career focused and are more likely to take jobs that pay less

That's simply not true in general and when true is due to a still sexist society that see the women as a mother first.

&gt;Any gap between the genders when it comes to wages, is because women do less than men overall.

This is REALLY sexist and even less true than the other misogynist affirmation you made. Just to give you a couple of examples: 

* Near the end of my formation me and my schoolmates started looking for a job and, we sent our CV to basically the same companies. The interesting fact is that even when I had the second best notes I've been called to far less interviews (I work in a male dominated field). Even more interesting was a company that  called me and two of my schoolmates at the interview: to me they offered 3700 CHF/month, to them 4200 CHF/month (we talked about it).
* Anothere example is a former colleague (women), with whom I was talking while taking a break, and she told me that she was moving with her partner and thinking about making a family. She didn't noticed that behind her there was a director and two weeks later she has been called to the HR and ""offered"" to accept a 50% contract or be fired. There was no complain about her, no motivation about this other than ""it's better for her"" (I've talked about it with the director, since after this we where undernumbered) and the company had to hire a new person.  


This are just two example I had first hand, but talking with a lot of other people this experiences are really, really common.

171,"/unpopularopinion u can't go colonizing, exploiting and bombing the shit out of the world at large without facing consequences. Remember the drive for war in Iraq? (Still looking for those WMDs) Remember the drive to help ""democracy"" in Syria? (Turns out we helped IS build a Caliphate) Remember Libia under Khaddafi? It's one of the biggest modern day open air slave markets now. Remember how when we ended colonization in most countries we didn't leave any form of government resembling capable or stable based on random lines some aristocrats drew a century ago and so had Africa go down a decades-long spiral of civil war, rape and genocide? 

This is not ""white people evil"" this is ""I know our collective history even if a lot of people want to forget it"". Now am I saying the average European or UK-citizen took part in the above? NO. But we did vote for the war criminals that did and that makes a LOT of people complicit wether they like to admit it or not.

Radical thought incoming: how about we stop pushing for (regime change) wars and spreading peace and democracy by sending over a British prince to shoot at them from a helicopter? Because nothing says peace and democracy like bombing a country back to the stone age and then occupying their lands and installing non democraticly elected ""allies"".

Then WHEN THEY(edit: the refugees if u will) LEAVE their shithole we (helped) created  how about we actually own up that our shit foreign policy is one of the main reasons these people are fleeing. How about we develop (this tends to ACTUALLY work) and help those countries (beginning by stopping the illegal bombings of Syria), build up some infrastructure back and MAYBE JUST MAYBE THEY WILL STOP FLEEING.

176,"&gt;A man and a woman working the same job, the same hours will make the same. If women where just magically paid less why ever hire a man.

That's true on public jobs or jobs under CC, but in a lot of jobs that's simply not true, I personally experienced this first hand too. It's not magic, it's sexism and misogynia, where people still thing that a woman is worth less and will do less job (look at some other commet right here, for example) and many think that a woman will leave the job when having a kid and don't even consider that not all women are the same.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is it? Or do most women not want to be in that kinda stressful position? Career women are just as successful as men. Most women, wether because they truly want to or due to social expectations, prefer lower paying but often more flexible jobs.

You get a point right: due to social expectations and pressure and education some woman will be less invested in career, and that's part of the problem, but it's true only for the older generations, new generation women are as career focused than men, but the wage gap is still there for them. All this is just a byproduct of sexism and old fashioned ideas still applied even if obsolete.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No, but increasing the pool means less unmotivated people need to go in, they can't instead do other shorter term work to help society.

260,"Revolt of the Ciompi 1378) was aninsurrection of the lower classes of Florence that briefly brought to power one of the most democratic governments in Florentine history. 

The ciompi (‚Äúwool carders‚Äù) were the most radical of the groups that revolted, and they were defeated by the more conservative elements in Florentine society.

A struggle between factions within the major ruling guilds triggered the uprising. Members of the lower classes, called upon to take part in the revolt in late June, continued to agitate on their own during the month of July. 

They presented a series of petitions to the Signoria (executive council of Florence) demanding a more equitable fiscal policy and the right to establish guilds for those groups not already organized. Then, on 21 July, the lower classes forcibly took over the government, placing one of their members, the wool carder Michele di Lando, in the important executive office of gonfaloniere of justice. The new government, controlled by the minor guilds, was novel in that for the first time it represented all the classes of society, including the ciompi, who were raised to the status of a guild.

But the ciompi were soon disillusioned. Their economic condition worsened, and the new government failed to implement all their demands. Conflicting interests of the minor guilds and the ciompi became evident. On August 31 a large group of the ciompi that had gathered in the Piazza della Signoria was easily routed by the combined forces of the major and minor guilds. 

In reaction to this revolutionary episode, the ciompi guild was abolished, and within four years the dominance of the major guilds was restored.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/ooit9q/on_this_day_in_1378_the_ciompi_revolt/h5yr6qn/,filosoful,1626842196

Surely you cannot be this stupid? The modern Turkish flag is nothing but a variation of the Ottoman flag, they are almost identical. The star and crescent is the symbol of Islam because of Turks, it isn't the flag of Turks because of Islam. The Turkish flag has nothing to do with religion. The origins of the flag are actually believed to come from the Byzantine Empire (although the historic accuracy of this is disputed).

nothing is ever black and white in that topic.

If you had any clue about the issue then you would know China is hardly the only country in the area claiming islands as ""theirs""

Half the countries in south east asia claim them as part of their territory. there are good maps available that show what a clusterfuck of claims the entire area is currently. So how is it in any way black and white? China is currently the strongest one of the claimants, doesnt mean the other countries are backing down from theirs any time soon. 

It isnt china vs. everyone else, its a dozent countries claiming the same area and willing to do all kinds of shady shit to get it with China currently having the best abilities to actually enfoce their claims.

So what are those british ships doing there? Fending of china and opening up the area for everybody else to fight  over? Trying to keep it basically as neutral waters against a dozent claimants wanting to get it themselfs? Which countries are supported and which not? Which interests in the Region are they supporting and which not?

I mean just take for example Taiwan. Taiwan is literally claiming the exact same land mainland China is claiming but doesnt have the capabilities to enfoce it yet.

Black and white is nothing in south east asia and China beeing aggressive is only because they now have the capabilities to actually enforce their claims. Every other country claiming the area would do the same if they had the possibilities or demand external forces to deny their enemies those claims.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/oo2pod/uk_to_permanently_assign_two_warships_to_asian/h5xt2qm/,BlueNoobster,1626825150

463,"&gt;0-5% of Americans are racist yet they have the biggest racial problems in the world?

There are places with active actual genocides on going right now. How is the US the place with the worst racial problems?

Also given France's laws about banning people the Hajib, that's a bit ironic. 

There's absolutely no racism in France, no. Marine Le Pen and the National Front Party being viable electoral contenders is just pure coincidence. There is no resentment of immigrants and others fueling their rise to power at all?

Poland is the only country to have an opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights because the Polish government is afraid that they would be forced by the EU to allow gay marriage. Which brings me to the next point that gay marriage is not allow in Poland. A gay couple is not allowed to adopt a child and conversion therapy is still allowed. These are probably the biggest reasons why Poland scored bad on this one map. Maybe Poland scores better on a different map.

793,"Loyalty and ""fighting to the last"" is all well and good, but how about winning? Wouldn't winning be nice?

Right now NATO command is an American monopoly. And I am , mostly fine with that. But let's face it, an American has a much different view from Prague getting bombed and Albuquerque getting bombed. One is a casualty of war, one is actually hitting home.

All our forces except one or two, as singular forces, are NOT setup to fight a prolonged conflict. I can tell you from Romania, only a fraction of equipment is in battle ready (read ""working"") condition. And from Germany, that there are severe personnel shortages. Individually we would be fucked in a confrontation with, let's say, the Russians because as poor as they are they've been fighting wars continuously for 2 decades, and have a lot more experience and stamina under their belt.

America is the only reason we currently stand a chance of winning, and if they decide to pull out from Poland or Slovakia, because of pressure or delays in cross-Atlantic transit, there would be nothing we could do about it besides either retreat with them, surrender or ""fight to the last man"".

Also, there is nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing, that saying an EU army would supplant a national army. That was never the goal, and never will be the goal.

933,"&gt; Absolutely. Personally I'm not super uncomfortable with the idea of the EU making decisions for memberstates as long as the decision making process is transparent, experts from said member state are involved and it can be fought in court if need be.

To be honest my concern there is more with the democratic process, which in an EU context is a bit of a double edged sword given the variation across the block (but has to be present if powers are shifted). Retaining checks and balances outside of the EU structure however would be hard at that point (member states would still have access to the courts of course, but you'd need to see more of a transfer of sovereignty, so CJEU decisions would have to be final and across the whole range of enlarged EU competencies).

&gt;Obviously not everything should be decided that high up but there's absolutely space the EU can fill (things like energy production and other big international problems).

Sort of, you need a general direction, the principle of subsidiarity works (ish..) in the context of a union of sovereign states, it starts to break down a little if you want an EU government more broadly.

&gt;What views are you talking about? The anti-lgbt stance of Poland and Hungary or more generally the cultural differences between memberstates?

The anti-LGBT stance is obviously currently very clear, but you can throw in some of the more volatile and extreme political positions that exist in some member states at a far higher level than in others. I'd assume that an EU with more democratic input would be more conservative (socially at least) and likely see more right of centre policy generally.

I know that it's somewhat vogue to look at the UK as having a very right wing, populist government at the moment, but arguably in an EU context it's pretty middle of the road, there is potentially more scope for something that is significantly more conservative, more right wing and more problematic emerging from a democratic EU. And that's without really accounting for things like the fairly xenophobic European nationalists out there (not just the 'EU as a white, European state' types, but the 'Travellers/Muslims/Arabs/Chinese/Indians etc.. are beneath us, 'European culture' warrior types).  

Essentially the people that scare me in that context are those that legitimately want to see the EU as a superpower to rival China or the US, or see the EU as a successor to various European empires, and are happy to get there with or without the support of Europeans in general. Although they aren't exactly a majority (but it does seem to be quite an appealing stance, somewhat Trumpina, but without the disdain for culture, education or science...).",Ulster,/r/europe/comments/on83kv/eu_wants_its_flag_to_fly_at_tokyo_olympics/h5vihxn/,marsman,1626789304

Except I'm the one who has remained true to facts here.

&gt;case in point

At one point one need to make judgement calls to save time if the other person is arguing in bad faith.

&gt;Nazi kill count sits at around 30 million including civilian an military deaths, the highest i can find for USSR is still around only 20 million (and from i remember its pretty bad and inflated estimate), not to mention that ussr existed for far longer than the reich.

Perhaps 30 if you include military deaths. [Yet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes#Soviet_Union):

&gt;Some historians attempt to make separate estimates for different periods of Soviet history, with casualty estimates varying widely from 6 million (for the Stalinist period)[75] to 8.1 million (for a period ending in 1937)[76] to 20 million[52][bg] to 61 million (for the period 1917‚Äì1987).[77]

&gt;They did, but i would say intent matters to some degree here

Both were hostile imperialistic dictatorships out for imperialistic gain.

&gt;They did, but i would say intent matters to some degree here, soviets wanted to set up totalitarian satellite states while nazis wanted their lebensraum, both unarguably bad but one of those has considerably worse goals.

1037,"&gt;30 million roman doesnt mean 30 million greek.

Of course. That was not what I said though, I was speaking of around 20 million Roman Greeks out of 30 million Romans in total, with the remaining 10 million being the rest of the many other ethnicities in the Roman Empire of Justinian (in 535 AD, before the Reclamation of Africa and Italy).  There were Dacians &amp; Thracians, Illyrians &amp; Dalmatians, Anatolians (mostly Cappadocians, since the rest had been Hellenized, but also the Armenians), and of course Syrians, Palestinians &amp; Jews, Arabs and Egyptians.

The issue is though that it seems that the Roman Greeks were by a great margin the majority, since they were also the highest urbanized nation. In the Eparchy of Hellas only (Central Greece and the Morea) there were 79 cities, while the average number of urban centers per eparchy was around 14!

&gt;Also he doesnt talk about history there. He points out a mentality.

And my example was a question of the systemic and systematic existence of examples that show this mentality, of whether it really did exist from the part of the Greeks, at least in the form of a genocide as was implied. What happened to the Turkish Cypriots by the terrorist EOKA B was appauling and terribly regrettable, and the perpetrators should face justice (like many of those of the Greek Army in Anatolia during the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922), but it is not an example of a state policy of a tradition as inferred above.",,/r/europe/comments/onyvmv/today_in_1974_turkey_invaded_cyprus_the_country/h5v5h6q/,Lothronion,1626782054

1058,"&gt; What makes a country a country?

Well for a start, people actually agreeing that it is a country (especially the people that live there). Beyond that, you'd usually look at something like control over territory (which the EU doesn't have, it's a member state competency), supremacy of law (again, something the EU doesn't have, but thinks it should have). Some people would add things like an Army, Foreign policy, Police, an elected government and so on, which again, given the tension within the EU's structures around EU vs member state competencies, and issues around support, the EU doesn't have.

That Scotland England and Wales have a non standard relationship as a country does not validate a Bavarian's arguement that because of: what translates as land from German, or being the same length of ISO code (I've only ever argued it lacks a ""country"" ISO code), or even that Bavaria shares a few similarities with countries (having an Embassy somewhere) doesn't make it a country or make ""we're the same as a country"" true - as I have read from time to time.

1184,"How exactly did they 'try to grab power'?

You seem to fundamentally misunderstand what the EU is. It's about a team of countries agreeing on standards between themselves - so yeah, that's intended to lay down rules within each country.

If you play a game of football you don't complain that the referee is 'grabbing power'. You're joining a game where you agree to abide by the rules.

Of course, bigots in every country hate the idea of abiding to the same rules as foreigners. That's a foundation for a lot of anti-EU sentiment. Many people have been against all kinds of equality throughout history.

Of course, at the end of the day if the people of a country decide to leave the EU, that country is completely free to do so. No power has been 'grabbed', no sovereignty has been 'lost'. It's a temporary agreement to work as a team.

But there are always going to be people who hate working with people who they see as different, and especially those who they see as inferior. That's a deeply seated flaw in many people, and other people are good at exploiting it.",,/r/europe/comments/on80ja/eu_to_plant_three_billion_trees_by_2030_under_new/h5uwr9u/,ikinone,1626775302

You missed the point about internalising externalities. If I gain 1‚Ç¨ from doing something, but it does 2‚Ç¨ of damage to the rest of society, then in total it does 1‚Ç¨ of damage, but I am incentivised to do it nonetheless. That is the problem. If we add a 2‚Ç¨ tax on that thing, then I am only incentivised to do it if the benefit to me is greater than 2‚Ç¨ or, in other words, if the total net benefit to all of society including myself is positive. That's what is important. Where the government chooses to spend those 2‚Ç¨ is irrelevant.

As an extreme example, imagine that I am polluting in a way that does limited damage (worth 1‚Ç¨) but is almost impossible to mitigate afterwards, and spending those 1‚Ç¨ on mitigation will only decrease the damage by 0.01‚Ç¨. At the same time, spending those 1‚Ç¨ on education will bring 1‚Ç¨ of value to society. It would be totally irresponsible to spend that money on mitigation, as it does very little good.

1301,"A little explanation what this map is showing: It is showing the death of the last living head of state during WWII (in Europe, means from 01.09.1939-08.05.1945) of each European country. this means: If a country had several heads of state during WWII, I only took the year the last living head of state died. I also did not include heads of states of puppet governments or those that were pressured from outside forces to become the head of state. I also did not take governments in exile into account since the head of state of those types of countries did not have any real power in their countries.

A few things about countries where I head to make compromise:

- Germany: The last head of state of Germany was not Hitler. It was Karl D√∂nitz, even though his government had very little power during the final days of WWII.

- Switzerland: Switzerland does not have one official head of state but 7 members of the federal council, so I took the year of the last living member of the federal council during WWII.

- Spain: Spain did not have a real head of state during the Franco dictatorship, so I took Franco as the head of state because that is the closest there was that could be interpreted as a head of state.

- Hungary: Hungary was officially a Kingdom without a king, therefore it did not have a head of state but only a head of the government (Miklos Horty).

- Danzig: Danzig did not officially have a head of state, therefore I didn't cover it.

- Andorra: I looked up the death of the last living co-prince of Andorra (Charles de Gaulle) and took his year of death.

- San Marino: It is very hard to get the information on the Captains Regents of San Marino and when they died, so I passed on this one.",,/r/europe/comments/onvvr0/year_of_death_of_the_last_living_head_of_state/h5uffu0/,asdlpg,1626760302

1349,"&gt;No. The German citizens did not bore the ultimate responsibility for Nazi Germany's actions

Yes. Because Nazis were an Alien tribe from Mars, which invaded Germany from space, right? They  totally didn't have anything with Germans, that's for sure! This Martians  filled the ranks of SS, NSDAP, police and Wehrmacht, not Germans!

\&gt;&gt;By God, they were going to pay for what Hitler did&lt;&lt;

Because, Hitler everything did personally, and none of the Germans helped him, right? Only during the Warsaw Upsrising, Germans slaughtered 150000 of Poles, including babes and pregnant women, but I guess Hitler just went to Warsaw and singlehandedly murdered all them?

\&gt;&gt;Stalin enslaved millions of Germans&lt;&lt;

But why Germans felt earlier the need to enslave or killed millions of people, can you explain it to me? Why Germans considered Jews and Slavs subhumans? Why ordinary German policemen from OrPo destroyed hundreds of villages, burning alive their inhabitants?

In my country, Poland, Germans murderd population of Warsaw and totally destroyed the city. After the war, German POWs were indeed forced to participate in rebuilding Warsaw. Do you think this German POWs were victims of Poles?

\&gt;&gt;they couldn't have approval for a surgery because he was just a useless Pollack&lt;&lt;

It's true, that &gt;&gt;Pollack"" is a German ethnic slur for Poles, and it's true that Polish slave workers deported to Germany during WW2 were denied access to a helathcare because Germans considered them subhumans. But you are confusing time when this happened: it couldn't have anything with the Iron Curtain (since 1945), because Third Reich didn't exists then.

1359,"Short version:

* With 100'000 Signatures, you can launch a constitutional initiative. If it passes with a majority of votes and a majority of state votes (citizens of a majority of states have at least 50% yes), then it becomes law.
* If the parliament passes a law, you can get 50'000 votes for a referendum. If a majority votes against, the law is gone. (Facultative referendum)
* For things like joining international organisationa, constitution changes and maybe some other things, there always is a vote. This is a simple majority as well. (Obligatory referendum)

I think I missed some things that a referendum can be held against, but those are the most important parts.

Some other things:
* It is common for the parliament to create a ""Gegenvorschlag"" counterproposal for an initiative if they think, that a compromise would be better. While the initiatives are fixed, these proposals are debated in the parliament. You can vote either yes or no for both the initiative and the counterproposal. This gives the direct democracy a more nuanced say.
* There is also the ""Vernehmlassung"". When laws are worked out, there is a comission that works with all parties and many other instances like NGOs, companies, interest groups and the likes to create a law, that is a good compromise.
* The swiss system is based on compromises and subject matter decisions. There is no coalition, alliances may vary between topics of the laws. The 7 federal councilors from 4 parties are a good representation of that. They are expected to leave party politics at the door when joining the council and strive for a consensus among the council.",Switzerland,/r/europe/comments/onmlls/should_switzerland_join_the_european_union_yes_20/h5ugtp3/,lukee910,1626761373

I know I'm going to get downvoted to hell for having a controversial opinion, but nevermind.

Most people, regardless of who/what they're attracted to, don't want to hurt their partners. Most pedophiles don't think ""yeah, I'm going to hurt children, this is going to be amazing"", but they genuinely think they're making love to them. With pedophilia illegal it's only criminals that actually do have sexual relationships with children, so our view is skewed. In the past pedophilia was much more socially accepted and somehow people were fine.

What I'm trying to say is that pedophilia is illegal because vast majority of children in such relationships end up being hurt, but it doesn't mean that *all* children end up hurt.

In particular, when you have a child nobody cares about and will most likely end up being homeless anyway, and you have a pedophile who claims to give it proper care, it's not that stupid to give it a try and see what happens.

If a NKVD officer finds you trying to escape, they would rarely shoot you. Most of the time, they would just return you to your unit. If it was your second time, they would send you to a military court to sentence you to either be shot(kinda rare), or sent to a penal battalion. Most of those who tried to escape was not shot, but was sent to the penal battalion. 
The NKVD was a bit far from the battlefield most of the time, they were not just near the army. Though sometimes they would be incorporated into the army if manpower is really low.

1504,"I agree with you and I certainly disagree with this bullshit law. However, what exactly do you expect parents to do if their 14 year old daughter is messaging with some 40 year old creep?

It‚Äôs way too invasive to take their phones and read their messages. That stuff can really damage the relationship between parents and their kids. Besides, you don‚Äôt want to read conversations between teenage girls as an adult? Do you want to be that kind of dictator parent?

As a parent a lot of stuff is simply out of your control, especially when it comes to children that are over 12/13 years old. They start living a life of their own and are masters at hiding their mistakes from their parents.

So always pointing our fingers at parents who should raise their kids better, that‚Äôs more easily said than done. I‚Äôve known some really good parents in my life, but their kids grew up to become thugs.

I have two daughters myself and they‚Äôve never been in any kind of trouble and are good students and they even give a lot of their pocket money to charity and try to make the best of their lives. However, that‚Äôs not all me. My wife passed away when my daughters were still really young so I raised them and still raise them as a single dad. However, I can‚Äôt even take credit for most of their awesome qualities as human beings. It‚Äôs really part of their own personality and life experiences outside the walls of our house that shaped them to be such amazing people.

It could have gone the other way and they could‚Äôve become bullies that go around making other people‚Äôs lives miserable. They could‚Äôve chosen to speak to shady figures online and get groomed. And let me tell you, young girls with no other relatives and a mother who passed away early on in their lives are statistically more inclined to make mistakes in their lives and risk their own safety.

But my daughters, as far as I know, have always protected themselves and each other from such things. They have become kind and loving young women because they chose to. I, as a busy father working two jobs, never gave them nearly enough attention to make them so awesome and raise them properly, they did so themselves.

I‚Äôve seen some amazing kind people who did their best for their kids and I would easily admit they are even better and more attentive parents than myself. And they‚Äôve had to pick up their kids from the police station multiple times, or are now visiting their kids in jail every week.

I‚Äôve seen the children of millionaires going to jail for robberies. Even a kid with a rich dad and all the money in the world CHOSE to steal.

So, go easy on the parents. Of course some are irresponsible, but many parents really do everything right to the best of their knowledge and fail miserably.",,/r/europe/comments/oni409/european_chat_control_plans_in_the_name_of_child/h5tr1x5/,Hefty_Independent_41,1626745908

A brain surgeon might not be great at critical thinking, but he sure knows more about the structure of the brain than you and I (unless I am talking to a brain surgeon). 

Herd immunity and vaccination are **related.** If you think you are up to the task, I recommend this (1984) \[paper\](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/76/4/524?fbclid=IwAR06PlMz8VJW4iHecyJrp1j-p9-tEcCWN44IMAbrKOs1U1QOy5zH\_-FpV4g) about the measles epidemic, that was successfully dealt with using vaccination. Or even more basic just look at the wiki for \[herd immunity\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd\_immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity)), vaccination appears 54 times!

What facade? What do you actually think is the purpose of the French government forcing people to get the vaccine other than getting rid of COVID? Increasing the stock value of an American company? 

Again, I'm not a fan how the French government is dealing with things, but I still have to hear a good argument why this new vaccine should not indeed be imposed? As of now, the benefit outweigh the risk. There is a like 20% excess death (I'm not sure of the exact number) due to COVID and I still have to hear of complications that are worse than that from the vaccine.",,/r/europe/comments/okbzuv/protests_in_france_against_covid19_health_pass/h5te546/,melclic,1626739500

1770,"Yeah I'll add on that especially early on Soviet leadership was mostly crap because Stalin purged a lot of the officer corp a few years prior. And incompetent leadership contributed to a lot of the early Soviet defeats. Eventually they went through enough commanders to find competent ones.

Also Hitler routinely threw away German lives. He constantly ordered units a the brink of collapse to not retreat and continue fighting. This greatly contributed to some of the biggest German defeats of the war including Stalingrad. I don't think a German victory was ever really possible but on multiple occasions the German cause was hurt by units being ordered to stay and be annihilated rather than retreat to fight another day. 

I'll also say in defense of ""zerging"" that a superior enemy with superior numbers will inflict disproportionate losses on the enemy. There's some sort of mathematical principle about it which I can't remember the name off atm. But basically a superior force (which the Soviets were for the last few years) should attempt to overwhelm the enemy with superior numbers.

Zerging wasn't a bad tactic they were just going about against the Wehrmacht which at least on the tactical level was well-led, well-equipped, and experienced.

Which already shows it's far more than simply a trade agreement. Member states can give competences to the Union to reach certain goals they have in common. 

Article 3 TEU:                
""*1. The Union's aim is to promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples.*

*2. The Union shall offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice without internal
frontiers, in which the free movement of persons is ensured in conjunction with appropriate
measures with respect to external border controls, asylum, immigration and the prevention and
combating of crime.*

*3. The Union shall establish an internal market. It shall work for the sustainable development of
Europe based on balanced economic growth and price stability, a highly competitive social market
economy, aiming at full employment and social progress, and a high level of protection and
improvement of the quality of the environment. It shall promote scientific and technological advance.
It shall combat social exclusion and discrimination, and shall promote social justice and protection,
equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and protection of the rights of the
child.
It shall promote economic, social and territorial cohesion, and solidarity among Member States.
It shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, and shall ensure that Europe's cultural heritage
is safeguarded and enhanced.*

*4. The Union shall establish an economic and monetary union whose currency is the euro.*

*5. In its relations with the wider world, the Union shall uphold and promote its values and
interests and contribute to the protection of its citizens. It shall contribute to peace, security, the
sustainable development of the Earth, solidarity and mutual respect among peoples, free and fair
trade, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights, in particular the rights of the child,
as well as to the strict observance and the development of international law, including respect for the
principles of the United Nations Charter.*

*6. The Union shall pursue its objectives by appropriate means commensurate with the
competences which are conferred upon it in the Treaties.*""

Hitler turned on them, which of course was his plan all along, but that doesn't make the Soviet Union ""victims"".  The Soviet civilians who were slaughtered by the Germans and then later victimized by friendly fire when the Soviets took their territories back, they are victims for sure, but not the nation itself. 

The nations that were victims were the countries caught in between Germany and the Soviet Union. They were blasted to the moon by the Nazis and subject to genocide and/or forced labor, then when the Soviets took on the offensive, they were caught in the crossfire thanks to the Soviet Union's irresponsible offensive. When the Soviet Union took the offensive, they took no precautions for civilian life and chose chaotic warfare as a quicker approach, rather than going with a more long-term campaign that would have resulted in far fewer casualties. They didn't really care who got caught in the middle nor did they take much thought for the casualties of their own soldiers. The soldiers after all were assets of the state that could be replaced. And they did it so that they could get there before the US/UK conquered from the West, because they would then lose any ability to lay claim to Eastern Europe and Eastern Germany. So in the end, they got what they wanted from the beginning.  New territories, new assets, new natural resources, and a greatly increased power base.

and if we talk about the EU



&gt;Before the Commission proposes new initiatives it assesses the potential economic, social and environmental consequences that they may have. It does this by preparing 'Impact assessments' which set out the advantages and disadvantages of possible policy options.

&gt;The Commission also consults interested parties such as non-governmental organisations, local authorities and representatives of industry and civil society. Groups of experts give advice on technical issues. In this way, the Commission ensures that legislative proposals correspond to the needs of those most concerned and avoids unnecessary red tape.



&gt;Citizens, businesses and organisations can participate in the consultation procedure via the website Public consultations.



&gt;National parliaments can formally express their reservations if they feel that it would be better to deal with an issue at national rather than EU level.

You say that the thread is unmoderated. The thread was locked and hidden by the moderators. 

You say that it is mostly toxic and I agree it is a bad thread, but the top voted post is about how old habbits die hard, the second about how toxic the thread is becoming. You need to go to the seventh post before anyone mentions anything negative. The fourth poster even tell people to remember that almost half of the UK wanted to stay. I am sure that there is negative posts, but they are not amongst the highest upvoted.

Now you ask me if every pensioner living in Spain or other EU countries voted leave. I know that they didn‚Äôt, but I also know that a majority did. The reason that I know that is that it have not been forgotten. It have in fact been mentioned in every thread.  As I said before it was also mentioned in the thread you see as mostly negative.

2303,"There's a very strong tone of superiority through this rant.  
   
Not every country outside the EU is a third world country. The EU citizens aren't being treated unfairly, they are being treated with the same degree of scrutiny as citizens of any country with whom the UK does not have a common travel area. If you are upset this includes your own country now, I have to ask where your anger was when you were given privileged access.  


I think there's a decent moral argument that those with family already in the UK should be allowed to claim asylum there. However, it's a catch 22 because in order to officially determine that, they need to be interviewed by an immigration authority, which means again, at that point if they have a valid asylum claim, it should be handled at the border of the first safe country.   


Before Brexit, this would mean they claim asylum in the EU and, once settled, are free to move to the UK. Since Brexit, this is no longer possible. And, to be clear, these camps were there decades before Brexit, so France had time to process them before this came to a head, but it was expedient not to.  


As for your claim that they are from Iraq and Afghanistan, the actual most common countries of origin are Eritrea, Somalia and Syria. Now, to be fair, we *did* bomb Syria. But then, so did France, you don't get to wash your hands of that.  


And to answer your question about morality. Yes, it absolutely can be moral to force someone to do something they do not want to do. It can even be a moral requirement. Once they have been processed and their claims either accepted or rejected, the moral thing to do it to return them to their country of origin (if rejected) or provide them with a place to live, clean clothes, running water, electricity etc, even if they would rather stay in a crime-ridden camp waiting for a dangerous channel crossing to be offered by human traffickers.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/omsfaw/eu_countries_pushing_back_asylum_seekers_at_sea/h5qhin0/,Surface_Detail,1626688274

2560,"You can make whatever list you wish, it still wouldn't be as bad as what the Nazis did, as I demonstrated. If the Nazis had won, they would've exterminated the rest of the Jews in Europe (4-6 million more), just like they had killed 55-75% of Jews in Europe during the war (and 14% of Soviets during the war, while Der Hungerplan was fully intended and projected by the Nazis to kill 14% more during the war alone - it failed only because the Nazis were pushed back by the Soviets).

And they would be trying to kill 50-100% of Slavs based on their nationality after the war, if they had won.

We know what happened to Germans in East Germany. Oppressions, deportations, killings and a police state notwithstanding, they were not exterminated nor did anyone even plan their extermination or try it. Now compare that to what happened to Soviet areas during WWII. Indiscriminate destruction of entire areas just on the basis of suspicion that every Nazi officer could order as per the Barbarossa Decree (see also https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandenbek%C3%A4mpfung )

I've talked about how anti-Semitic Stalin was and how he didn't lift a finger to liberate Aushwitz in this thread or how he purposefully let Germans snuff the Warsaw Uprising. The Germans still conducted the only genocide by industrial means in the history of mankind and it was still Germans themselves who killed those Poles and they planned to kill 85% of them if they had won the war. Stalin didn't kill 85% of Poles or ""every man, woman and child of Polish derivation and language"" (Obersalzberg speech) as Hitler had planned, even though he had ample time to do so.

&gt;  
&gt;Don‚Äôt see those unverifiable claims on Amnesty and HRW

It's funny that you just essentially told me ""I didn't read the document"", because if you had read it, you'd have noticed that in in that same ""pro democracy for cuba organization"", they cite Amnesty and other human rights organizations.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Prisoner of conscience and human rights defender Orlando Zapata Tamayo died while on hunger strike on February 23, 2010. Orlando Zapata Tamayo had been beaten and tortured on several occasions by prison guards and state security along with other prisoners. His body was scarred and his health in decline. Amnesty International reported that, on ""October 20, 2003 \[Orlando Zapata\] was dragged along the floor of Combinado del Este Prison by prison officials after requesting medical attention, leaving his back full of lacerations."" The case of Ariel Sigler Amaya, another Cuban prisoner of conscience, is instructive. He had to threaten a hunger strike, although already emaciated and crippled, to obtain medical treatment to save his life.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Juan Wilfredo Soto Garc√≠a, 46, belonged to the Central Opposition Coalition (Coalici√≥n Central Opositora) and Amnesty International reported that he had served a 12-year prison sentence for his political activities.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, ""Don‚Äôt see those unverifiable claims on Amnesty and HRW"", literally a few paragraphs into the amnesty article:

&gt;Authorities continued to clamp down on all forms of dissent, imprisoning political leaders, independent journalists and artists.  
&gt;  
&gt;In April, the authorities released Jos√© Daniel Ferrer Garc√≠a, leader of the unofficial political opposition group Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) and former prisoner of conscience, who had been imprisoned in October 2019 and tried on 26 February in a trial tainted by irregularities.1 The Cuban authorities had prevented the press, the EU and Amnesty International from monitoring his trial.  
&gt;  
&gt;Reports of independent journalists fined for reporting on COVID-19 and its impact on the country prompted calls for President Miguel D√≠az-Canel to take immediate measures to guarantee press freedom.2 Civil society and journalists also expressed concern during the year that Decree-Law 370, a law related to online expression, appeared to tighten the Cuban government‚Äôs network of control and censorship online, especially during the pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;In March, Cubanet journalist Camila Acosta was arrested for hours and given a fine for sharing information on Facebook. In September, she was arrested again and threatened with further prosecution for protesting Decree 370. On 4 September, the authorities released independent journalist with Cubanet, Roberto Qui√±ones Haces, aged 63. He had been tried in 2019 and sentenced to one year‚Äôs imprisonment for ‚Äúresistance‚Äù and ‚Äúdisobedience‚Äù because of his work as a journalist. Amnesty international, Article 19, the Institute for War and Peace Reporting and the Committee to Protect Journalists called consistently for his release, especially in the context of his heighted risk from COVID-19 as a person with underlying medical conditions and over the age of 60. Roberto Qui√±ones had published articles about his prison conditions, including overcrowding, poor food and water quality, and lack of adequate medical care.3  
&gt;  
&gt;Throughout the year, authorities harassed and intimidated members of the San Isidro Movement ‚Äì composed of artists, poets, LGBTI activists, academics and independent journalists. Its members were at the forefront of challenging Decree 349 that stands to censor artists. The authorities‚Äô actions symbolized Cuba‚Äôs ongoing repression of the right to freedom of expression in the country.4  
&gt;  
&gt;Luis Manuel Otero Alc√°ntara, a key leader in the movement, was jailed for two weeks in March, having reportedly been charged with ‚Äúinsults to symbols of the homeland‚Äù (Article 203 of the Penal Code), an offence inconsistent with international human rights law and standards, and ‚Äúdamage‚Äù to property (Article 339).5  
&gt;  
&gt;In November, the San Isidro Movement garnered international attention when members went on hunger strike to demand the release of rapper Denis Sol√≠s Gonz√°lez, who had been sentenced to eight months‚Äô imprisonment for ‚Äúcontempt‚Äù, a crime also inconsistent with international human rights standards.  
&gt;  
&gt;Following a police raid on the headquarters of the movement in Old Havana ‚Äì which according to Cuba‚Äôs official newspaper was carried out due to alleged violations of COVID-19 related health protocols ‚Äì authorities took Luis Manuel Otero Alc√°ntara into custody again for several days, and detained academic Anamely Ramos Gonz√°lez for approximately 12 hours.6  
&gt;  
&gt;In response to the raid, on 27 November, hundreds of artists and intellectuals staged a rare protest outside the Ministry of Culture and secured an equally unusual audience with the Vice Minister of Culture.  
&gt;  
&gt;For approximately two weeks after the meeting, members of the movement, including Luis Manuel Otero Alc√°ntara and Anamely Ramos Gonz√°lez, and approximately 10 or more activists and independent journalists were subjected to constant surveillance and faced arrest by police and state security officials if they left their houses, essentially amounting to house arrest, in violation of international law.7

No. The ECJ ruled on what the Netherlands are or aren't supposed to do with respect to their citizenship (individual examinations in this case), while there is no legal grounds for such a decision.

&gt; As for that ""something called the EU citizenship which has no practical meaning"": I'm pretty sure that it does have a practical meaning. Having citizenship in any of the countries of the EU grants an individual rights in all countries which joined the reciprocal agreement, i.e., the EU. 

The freedoms of the EU are granted by the virtue of possessing national citizenship, not by virtue of possessing the so-called EU citizenship.

2630,"Translation:

Ibiza enquiry ends early - and puts Chancellor Sebastian Kurz in the dock
Austria's parliament ends the work of the Ibiza Committee. It has uncovered a badly damaged rule of law.

As absurd as it sounds, Heinz-Christian Strache would have earned a medal for the Republic's merits. Without the ex-party leader of the right-wing FP√ñ, who in 2017 was secretly filmed in a holiday villa on Ibiza as vice-chancellor-to-be, as he submitted alcohol-soaked power fantasies and corruption deals to an alleged oligarch's daughter, Austrians would not know today what a battered state their state is in.

Because without this ""b'soffene G'schicht"" (quote Strache - drunken story), there would not be the Ibiza enquiry committee with the subtitle ""concerning alleged purchasability of the Turkish-blue federal government"".

Strache's racketeering, however, became a minor matter in the course of the investigation. Instead, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his People's Party √ñVP became the focus of the justice system. The young chancellor, soon to be 35 years old and a father-to-be, has since faced a major test for the first time after his dizzying rise to become the youngest EU head of government. It is quite possible that he will not pass it.

For the record so far of the Ibiza investigation, which ends prematurely today, could not be more devastating. Kurz is Austria's first chancellor since 1945 to be charged with making false statements. And his √ñVP looks like a felt of power arrogance and nepotism.

The chat that convicted the chancellor

A prime example of Kurz's machinations was the appointment of Thomas Schmid as the new head of the board of the state holding company √ñbag, which manages the Republic's shares in listed companies. During his appearance before the Ibiza Committee, Kurz said he had been informed about Schmid's application but had not actively intervened. He was unable to recall anything in response to questions about the case a total of 88 times: ""To be honest, I have no perception of this,"" was his standard answer.

The opposition Ibiza committee members did not buy that. After all, Thomas Schmid was not a stranger, but the Secretary General in the Ministry of Finance, whose incumbent Gernot Bl√ºmel is in turn Kurz's closest confidant.

And lo and behold: the chats seized by the public prosecutor's office confirm Kurz's personal involvement in the case: ""You get everything you want anyway,"" the chancellor wrote to Schmid. ""Don't worry, you're family,"" Finance Minister Bl√ºmel let his colleague Schmid know - which earned the √ñVP more than one mafia comparison in the Austrian media. ""I love my chancellor,"" minion Schmid thanked Kurz. And Bl√ºmel renamed the √ñbag straight into ""Schmid-AG"" for internal use.

The whole thing has now ended with criminal proceedings against Kurz on suspicion of corruption. Even at the end of the Ibiza investigation, it is not yet clear when the trial will start. Chancellor Kurz, however, is confident and recently confirmed that he would not resign even in the event of a guilty verdict.

Why the investigation is now being terminated

The defence strategy of the Chancellor and the Austrian People's Party (√ñVP): attack the judiciary, of which Kurz presents himself as a victim. He apparently accepts that he is calling the rule of law into question. For example, the chancellor suspects ""red networks"" in the public prosecutor's office for corruption, without presenting any evidence for this.

Wolfgang Sobotka's statement was even more ludicrous. Sobotka, nota bene, president of the National Council and chairman of the Ibiza Committee, seriously suggested exempting witnesses from the obligation to tell the truth. Critical questions would only ""unsettle them and entangle them in contradictions"".

The fact that Kurz and the √ñVP still have a lot to hide and fear is ultimately proven by the majority decision in parliament to prematurely stall the Ibiza Committee as of 15 July. The co-ruling Greens had to agree with a clenched fist in their pocket. New elections in the midst of an uncertain pandemic would also be inconvenient for Kurz's coalition partners.",North Tyrol,/r/europe/comments/on6hrk/austrian_state_of_affairs_portrayed_by_a_swiss/h5prt9g/,Oachlkaas,1626667663

Since rights are spread over an impossible lot of people, this effectively means that you have to filter - it might mean that the users being required to mark something as parody for a while, and if we're lucky that practice will hold up, but I doubt that this will survive the courts as most things don't obviously fulfill the formal requirements.

Financial regulations? That's eurozone and we still have no common fiscal policy despite everyone recommending it.

Then there's the Treaty of Lisbon... These are all choosings of the member states being more close togheter using EU as a means, not the other way around like so many people seem to think.

&gt;Anything can be seen as affecting the single market, therefore, by extension, anything can be interpreted as the responsibility of the EU. That's what they are trying to do.

Finally, because not everyone is participating it gives more power to those who try to influence the elections. It's not easy to convince half the population, but 1/4, much more achievable.

2712,"Interestingly, the angle is different but the overall the subject is roughly the same size. 

But the objects in the background are generally bigger for the old photo. 

This is at least in part due to the technology. This is probably 45mm or maybe medium format  film. 

The new one is probably at best a 1.4x crop of 35mm but probably more like a 7x crop. 

That means that the equivalent lens, position, angle ect taken with a 35mm camera will be upto 7x wider angle. 

To counter this effect modern smart phone cameras have extremely wide angle lenses on them. The iPhone has a 4mm lens which is roughly equivalent to 26mm on a 35mm camera with no crop. 

What this means is that objects further away look much further away. The old camera probably has a 50mm or bigger lens on which actually makes objects further away look closer and bigger in reference to the subject. 

Add to this that the background is actually still in focus and we can assume the image was shot with a fairly fast film probably something like 200 or 400 (faster films are lower ISO so show more detail) and a fairly closed off aperture. 

What tends to happen with bigger lenses is that background details are lost to DOF blur; however having either a very wide lens or a very closed aperture with sharpen an image out to infinity. 

The iPhone camera lens is so wide it‚Äôs practically impossible to have any kind of DOF. 

All this to say, it was probably a very bright and sunny day and the photo was probably taken with a 35mm or bigger film format with quite a good film.

Comparing the death toll of an ideology that had only a decade to rack up the kill count to one that had almost a century is at best unfair and at worst intentionally dishonest. Even if the death toll was outright comparable, the death under Communism were from economic destruction and political executions which never got to the scale of the Nazis. The deaths under Nazism are from intentional and unrestrained genocide. If you honestly think these two are comparable in how evil they are then you have something wrong with your moral compass.

In case you missed it, the ""moral imperative"" to welcome all refugees from countries pushed in even more shamble than they were before by invasions &amp; civil wars (like iraq, UK took part in it no? Yet, Europe should deal with it, not the UK) allowed the far right &amp; all kind of racists to get a whole lot more tractions in numerous European countries, should we keep following a blind moral imperative even if it end up putting at the head of countries fascist like / light regimes?

It wasn't that far in Greece &amp; Italy, strangely those are at the frontline when it come to refugees arriving in Europe...


Moral is nice theoretically, in practice it may have worse results than not so moral acts, this world isn't good or bad, it's a whole lot of grey tones.


It's despicable, it's all i can say.

Because i've seen lot of moral high ground standing from the UK in the past years but not so much acts.

Play the moral high grounds while staying under cover on your side of the Channel, paying cheaply your neighbors to deal with those who want to seek refuge in the UK.

Spending years whining after Europe (despite having more free pass than any other full member).

Puting in jail for days Europeans who came for job interviews in place of sending them back immediately.

Having British press all scandalized because British expatriates living &amp; sometimes working illegally in some European countries (despite years to legalize their status since the referendum) are sent back...

Having proud Britons using slurs on social medias on a German kid crying after the loss of her team.

Having anonymous Britons letting threatening letters to Europeans legally working in the UK.

2834,"*When in the recorded history was anywhere close to 10 million people resettled in a space of like 2-3 years?*

You were given examples and then tried to move the goal posts to a specific event that occurred during the 20th century. You were then given an even more specific example from the same decade. If you are going to try be pretentious in pushing the idea you have a superior knowledge of history at least learn the basics. 

It‚Äôs understandable if you are conflicted or emotional about your families questionable history since you are clearly from Eastern Europe. Based on your ongoing projection I‚Äôm going to guess a great grandparent was impacted by forced absorption into the Soviet Union in somewhere like East Germany.

No need to act like an asshole to others who were impacted by the same events. The sooner you come to terms with whatever hang up you have the sooner you can start to understand the full scope of the events. Rather than trying to rewrite history in order to make the Germans who were pushed west or caught behind the iron curtain the true victims of WW2. Yes what happened to innocent civilians caught in the middle of the war and later under Soviet control was terrible. However, your attempts to frame the discussion in a way that focuses on just those impacts is as disingenuous as it is inherently flawed. 

The entire basis of your claim has been completely debunked by multiple people. Turning to personal insults and acting in a condescending manner as if the opposite were true is a very insecure way to deal with having your beliefs challenged. Take the opportunity to learn something from those with more knowledge of a topic rather than lashing out at them or you will be stuck at the starting line forever.

5) They may live, but I don't like them.

So you ask, how it effects on traditional couples. It is simple. Marriage is a union between man and woman, nothing else. Gay* marriages and Gay parenting makes society less stable, because there will be dozen of family types. Ordinary people won't see traditional** marriage as an only option(not for them, but in general), so then they will care less about their marriage, because ""they are just 2 people who love each other""***

It's not that you can't have an argument, and that you are upset your insults aren't getting a reaction out of me or anything

But that I'm boring

Okay, if you want to have it that way you can, doesn't make you less wrong though and this situation less sad.

The Molotov-Ribbentrop deal was a non-aggression pact that both sides considered more of a temporary cease-fire than anything else.

It didn't happen because of ideological overlaps and the two sides just loving each other that much, it was a calculated strategic decision both sides only agreed to as it gave them time to prepare for the inevitable clash that was bound to happen.

Meanwhile, the same Soviets were *literally allied* to the United States, a US that, as some Americans like to remind everybody when the topic of WWII comes up, in major parts [supplied the USSR with weapons and resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease#US_deliveries_to_the_Soviet_Union), even while the USSR was committing its own atrocities.

The reality is that even WWII wasn't this ""just"" and ""clean"" war it's usually made out to be with one ""good side"" fighting the absolute ""evil side"", pretty much everybody involved had plenty of innocent blood on their hands in some way or another, which is true for nearly most human conflicts.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/omks6x/brief_history_of_world_war_ii_for_eastern_europe/h5n51mw/,Nethlem,1626623476

Climate change is going to absolutely ravage and devastate sub Saharan Africa and India especially. There will be **billions** of the worlds poor living in a literal hell on earth of murderous high temperatures, biblical natural disasters being a daily occurrence, never ending famine and drought, the inevitable increase in disease and conflict because of this.

These people will have to flee, by the hundreds of millions. They have two directions they can go, east or west.

They represent the end of European Western civilisation if they flood into Europe. Our society cannot support them. Our lifestyles we currently have cannot possibly survive that level of immigration. Our social safety nets would collapse. Our health services would collapse. Our ability to educate our children would collapse. Our ability to feed our populations would collapse. Our ability to provide housing for our people would collapse. Our ability to maintain law and order would collapse.

So yes. Immigration is a far bigger danger to the West than an increase in storms and higher temperatures will.

Europe is not at an existential threat directly from climate change, not only will climate change hit us much less than many other places in the world, but we are rich enough to adapt to these changes and maintain our high standards of living regardless.

We are however indirectly threatened by it for the reasons I have listed.


**HUGE DISCLAIMER BEFORE THE USUAL SUSPECTS ADD MEANING TO WHAT I SAID THAT ISNT THERE AND DEXIDE TO TAKE OFFENCE**.

Most people do learn because they are interested in the language and it's obvious that if you're interested in the culture and history it's easier for you to learn because you have more motivation.

No, I'm trying to tell you that most people learn a foreign language because they need to use the internet, and not because they want or like the history or culture of the country they are learning about.

3323,"&gt;There are hardly any statistics of how many of them are what. But I doubt if you want to play the numbers game as their diaspora in the UK and Turkey are huge. They can all come back and whatnot, which would even disturb the 1/4 old ratio.

There was a census by the British before the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus, and also census after, and the proportion of TCs is the same, about 18%. There are many GCs in diaspora as well. If everybody comes back, the ratio will still be the same. Unless you argument is that all TCs of diaspora will return, but no GC will.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And they owned pretty much 25-27%, as they had more lands than GCs and there was the Evkaf.

As I said there are the records of the Land Registry which exist since the British rule. You say 25-275, I could say 5-7%. What matters are the actual official records.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Modern national identity and Greek Roman identity are not the same.

I think we know our own identity better than you.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Settlers were minimal and many of those were married with Catholics. What you mean is banished people I assume because that's what Ottomans used island as.

There are Ottoman records about sending 10s of thousands of people from Anatolia to Cyprus. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Language shift can happen and while huge numbers of Greek speaking TCs explain lots, that's not the sole explainer. 

How would a language shift happen if no great numbers of Settlers were brought to Cyprus? In those times people did not receive any formal education, they learned the language of their parents. If the Settlers brought to Cyprus were few, then they would have assimilated with the existing population and their descendants would speak Greek as their mother language. There are other previously Christian populations which became Muslim during Ottoman rule, but those didn't change their language. 

The Anatolian Settlers during Ottoman times must be at least 50% of the ancestors of the TCs, which is why those settlers assimilated the Greek Cypriots who adopted Islam, and not the other way around. Of course some part of TCs ancestors are indeed GCs, which is why some TCs had Greek as their first language (many others spoke Greek as a second language, because that was the language of the majority of the population of Cyprus). We are very similar because we are ""half-siblings"", so more common between us than any others, but I don't think it is historically accurate to say that nearly no people moved to Cyprus from Anatolia during Ottoman rule.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Turkish leadership wanted partition in response to Greek annexation. That's what even TMT members do say. If there was an issue of enosis, they'd want taksim indeed for not being part of Greece. Nobody wanted taksim aside from a few in practice.

First of all when the population of a territory is in its vast majority Greek (and has been so since antiquity), it only makes sense that this territory would be part of Greece, if this is what most of the people of the territory want. Rhodes, which also has a Turkish minority, united with Greece in 1947, and not a single nose broke over this. I understand TCs not wanting to be part of Greece, but the same thing can be said for the Greeks whose homeland became part of Turkey (and nobody asked them if they agreed)

Union with Greece did not entail any human right violations against TCs, and the struggle of GCs was against the British Colonists, not against any other Cypriots. 

On the other hand partition required the ethnic cleansing of GCs from half of the land they inhabited for 1000s of years, and TMT was formed to attack Greek Cypriots. That is when and how the inter-communal conflict started from the 50s.

Still, with the 1960 agreements union with Greece became impossible, even though this might have continued to be what some Cypriots wanted. And after 1967, when Junta came to power in Greece, the desire for enosis was basically over among the great majority of Greek Cypriots. 

And yet the Turkish Cypriots continued to pursue partition, through the 60s and 70s, and in 1983 they declared a separate state in Cyprus, and were electing Rauf Denktash as their leader for decades, long after the cause of union with Greece was dead and buried. 

So to say that partition exists only because of the ""issue of enosis"" is proven false by history itself. Even the latest leader of TCs was elected with an aim to legalize partition. 

It is not about enosis at all, especially now and for the last several decades. What it really is about is interests, with the Turkish Cypriots trying to gain as much as possible on the expense of all other Cypriots, something which they can achieve only by collaborating with Turkey (but of course Turkey's help comes with strings attached)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is that what they teach in Greek Cypriot education system? Because what people had experienced was not that at all... They had been forced into those areas, and in those areas, they started to express their self-rule with TMT having administrative elements. It was indeed a step towards partition but it wasn't their plan or anything - it was practically what they had to do given GC pressure enforcing them into those. 

Partition was the plan of the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot leadership, and this was no secret. Their actions were driven by this aim. 

Of course there was a conflict, and people from both sides were killed and suffered from it (the story I link below, among other things, talks about the killing of Greek Cypriot students and a pregnant woman). That conflict was not one sided (as is the case in the conflict of Turkey with the Kurds, for example) and the main reason Turkish Cypriots were instructed to move into separate zones controlled by TMT was the anticipation of the Turkish invasion and partition.

I presume you can read Turkish, so here is an article by Turkish Cypriot Sevg√ºl Uludaƒü in a Turkish Cypriot newspaper: [https://www.yeniduzen.com/baf-carpismalarinin-1964-yilinda-da-1974-yilinda-da-sahidiyim-17194yy.htm](https://www.yeniduzen.com/baf-carpismalarinin-1964-yilinda-da-1974-yilinda-da-sahidiyim-17194yy.htm)

I know a lot more about the history of Cyprus than what they teach in our schools, but it seems you only know of the official one sided Turkish position. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A stepping stone I had referred to was living together. And, you don't have to agree on everything but can agree on the road after unification as your expressed periods.  
  
Veto rights are going to be remain there indeed, but may hardly be used in the future. Zonality is also going to be moot in practice if you start to live together again.

If they will hardly use the vetoes and zonality is going to be moot in practice, then why demand those things in the first place? 

As I said we are willing to make a great amount of compromises, but we shouldn't expect the agreement to be a stepping stone for something else, or that the other side will not use the powers granted to it by the agreement. This is a recipe for more problems.

3481,"No, not every bit of evil, as intentions matter and the reality of what happened matters as well.

What the Nazis practiced on the Eastern front was called Vernichtungskrieg, a war of total annihilation of the state, physical destruction of the enemy, their culture and their livelihood (see Der Hungerplan, for instance). (And it wasn't the first time Germans practiced such a war. They practiced it in Africa against the Herero and Namaqua people and by proxy via their allies, the Austrohungarians, during WW1 against Serbia.)

For example, even though Soviets were anti-Semites and oppressed Jews and the inner commie party believed in a worldwide Jewish conspiracy like the Germans did, they did not plan to exterminate Jews through industrial genocide because they thought they were perverting and corrupting the ""god-given"" race (the result was the killing of 55-75% of European Jewry, including about 1.75 million children).

Even though the Soviets killed a lot of Poles, they did not believe that all ""men, women, and children of Polish derivation and language"" were to be killed as Hitler said in his Obersalzberg speech.

Even though the Soviets oppressed and murdered civilians, they did not believe that:

&gt;After the defeat of Soviet Russia there can be no interest in the continued existence of this large urban centre. [...] Following the city's encirclement, requests for surrender negotiations shall be denied, since the problem of relocating and feeding the population cannot and should not be solved by us. In this war for our very existence, we can have no interest in maintaining even a part of this very large urban population.

According to Generalplan Ost, 50-100% of Slavs (based on their nationality) were to be killed after the war, the rest of them enslaved, ethnically cleansed or ""aryanized""^1. This would result in the killing of something like 200+ million Slavs.

^1

&gt;A 1942 Wehrmacht document suggested that the Nazi leadership considered implementing a special policy for the eastern front through which the estimated 750,000 babies born through sexual contact [read: as a result of rapes] between German soldiers and Russian women (an estimate deemed very conservative), could be identified and claimed to be racially German. (It was suggested that the middle names Friedrich or Luise be added to the birth certificates of male and female babies.) Although the plan was not implemented, such documents suggest that the births that resulted from rapes and other forms of sexual contact were deemed beneficial, increasing the ""Aryan"" race rather than as adding to the inferior Slavic race. The underlying ideology suggests that German rape and other forms of sexual contact may need to be seen as conforming to a larger military strategy of racial and territorial dominance.

So the rapes, which were bigger in scale and scope can be inferred to be a part of the strategy to colonize Eastern Europe.",,/r/europe/comments/omks6x/brief_history_of_world_war_ii_for_eastern_europe/h5mdwcj/,Pay_Wrong,1626609417

3484,"It's exactly that type of ""thinking"" that leads to the type of mess we're in now. Democracy is not simple, nor should it be.

The referendum was called by a party who won 43% of the popular vote, none of whom were polled specifically on the policy to hold a referendum on EU membership.

The referendum itself was then a very simplified version of the debate on EU membership and dogged by misinformation on both sides, so leave voters could not actually accurately know what they were voting for.

It was called as an ""advisory referendum"", an important fact that was forgotten amongst the political infighting and frankly embarrassing pandering that followed by both main parties.

The PM who called the referendum in the first place then fucked off in a cloud of self pity leading to major powershifts in the party that only 43% of Britons had voted for a year prior, based on a manifesto in which the EU Referendum was just one of many policies that may have drawn their vote.

Four years of utter chaos followed during which multiple local, national and EU elections were held and votes cast for all manner of parties representing a myriad  of different views and policies, yet without fail every time the vote was treated as another referendum, whilst the people actually calling for a sensible second referendum to gauge more accurate feelings from voters were constantly shot down.

After four years during which the demographic of voters had shifted monumentally, the fateful day of Brexit actually occurred during an unprecedented global crisis all because that monumental cunt in number 10 and his corrupt colleagues were determined to keep some imaginary promise that nobody with the authority to do so ever even made.

3525,"Cool, but as I literally said; I'm referring to authoritarian forms of communism/socialism, which unfortunately have been the forms of socialism we've most seen in history. I've got nothing against democratic socialism or even anarcho-communism, nor communism in the sense of the utopia end-goal (even though I believe this end goal probably never will be reached and even if reached, would be very unstable and prone to collapsing if put under stress). 

And you're not entirely correct that the Russian revolution is not what Marx imagined. Biggest flaw of the USSR is that Marx envisioned already industrialised and developed nations to make the transition, not mostly agricultural nations like Russia. But Marx does in fact call for a violent seizing of the means of production and it also can't be denied that authoritarian socialism as seen in the USSR was ideologically not meant as the end-goal but as a transition period before utopic communism. This is fairly in line with Marx. As I said; biggest flaw was that the revolution happened in a country that was not yet ready for it, according to Marx's ideology. So the rapid industrialisation under Stalin, with millions of deaths, wasn't something that can be connected to Marx. But the USSR of the late 60's onwards I think reasonably can be said follows Marx's principles.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/oly18z/on_this_day_in_1918_nicholas_ii_the_last_tsar_of/h5m4l9c/,RegisEst,1626601945

3626,"&gt; At the moment you have an 80% less probability to spread the virus if you are fully vaccinated. When almost all the population is fully vaccinated, that 80% becomes virtually a 100% chance of not transmitting covid, because every person that covid meets has a 80% to not be infectious. The 80% probability adds up at every step, is simply math to see how very soon the transmission will be blocked.

First, those figures might be true for old variants, we don't know the probabilities of the new ones just yet. 

However, we also know that the reduction, in aggregate is certainly not 80% for vaccinated people. If it were anywhere close to 80%, the estimates for herd immunity wouldn't be at 80-90% vaccinated of total population. Math just works out that way.

&gt; Yes you can get covid if fully vaccinated, because no vaccine ever can offer a 100% protection against the mildest form of an infection, on even an asymptomatic one.

No vaccine is 100% effective, but Covid vaccines are far from 100% and, overall, Covid vaccines cannot be compared to typical vaccines in their effectiveness, at all. 

&gt; Vaccine are also a way to stop the virus to mutate.

You literally have no idea what you are talking about. Vaccinations increase the probability that mutations occur. Especially if the vaccine's effectiveness is far from 100%.",,/r/europe/comments/om5tvi/the_proportion_of_adults_vaccinated_against_covid/h5lwfns/,ComprehensiveHalf295,1626594994

&gt;what kind of precedent would it set if the patent was waived?

Maybe that we're really interested in humanity and not in making money.

&gt;Would companies bother creating a vaccine if they couldn't profit from it?

Yes if the purpose of the company is another than just profit.

&gt;The US focused on patents, knowing it's an empty gesture that would mostly damage European firms.

Yeah we all know, that the US is hyper capatalism and that they'll fuck up everything for their own interests.

Ohh so you're actually not from Austria? Or can't you identify with the EU as ""we""?

If we stay in capatalism, what we probably will, we need to improve it by many factors. It's incremental important, that we respect our nature and that we truely want to care about the poor, which suffer for our wealth.

3763,"Once upon a time there was an Austrian archduke named Franz Ferdinand who was a bit of a figurative bridge builder between the different people under his rule. So one day he goes to Serbia in an attempt to reduce the growing turmoil and wishes for independence but instead ends up getting assassinated. This gives the hardliners in the kingdom to go out in a war where countries bound by alliances are joining the war left and right, the first World War has now started.

Few years after this war a Germany that's suffocating under absurdly high reparation payments and going through their own economic hardship decides they've had enough of this and a fascist regime under Hitler gets in power. This regime is led by very racist and imperialistic ideals which shortly after prompt Germany to invade Poland in the hopes that other countries declare war on them so they can enact their new blitzkrieg strategy on them. 2 days later the UK and France declared war on Germany, two countries who were at the time seen as absolute super powers in the region, especially France who had been a formidable military opponent to Germany in the previous war. This time instead though, French military quickly crumbled under the new and modern way the Germans fought, this lead to the country quickly falling into German hands and thus most of mainland Europe is at this point in German/axis control.

This is where all the concentration camps for undesirables happen, the mass genocide of whole peoples by the German occupiers. Millions of innocent civilians getting killed systematically.

The first castle was built by Robert I, Count of Flanders, at the end of the 11th century and used as a base for military operations. In the 12th and 13th century, Wijnendale became a regular place of residence for the Counts of Flanders

3783,"Relevant book on topic - [Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodlands).

&gt;Before WW2 even began, Josef Stalin had killed millions of his own citizens‚Äîand kept killing them during and after the war. Before Hitler was finally defeated, he had murdered six million Jews and nearly as many other Europeans. At war‚Äôs end, both the German and the Soviet killing sites fell behind the iron curtain, leaving the history of mass killing in darkness.  
&gt;  
&gt;In his book, Snyder examines the political, cultural and ideological context tied to a specific region of Central and Eastern Europe, where Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union and Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany committed mass killings of an estimated 14 million noncombatants between 1933 and 1945, the majority outside the death camps of the Holocaust.  
&gt;  
&gt;Snyder's thesis is that the ""bloodlands"", a region that now comprises Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), northeastern Romania and the westernmost fringes of Russia, is the area that Stalin and Hitler's regimes, despite their conflicting goals, interacted to increase suffering and bloodshed many times worse than any seen in Western history.  
&gt;  
&gt;Snyder draws similarities between the two totalitarian regimes and also the enabling interactions that reinforced the destruction and suffering that were inflicted upon noncombatants.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bloodlands is a new kind of European history, presenting the mass murders committed by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes as two aspects of a single history, in the time and place where they occurred: between Germany and Russia, when Hitler and Stalin both held power. Assiduously researched, deeply humane, and utterly definitive, Bloodlands will be required reading for anyone seeking to understand the central tragedy of modern history.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/omks6x/brief_history_of_world_war_ii_for_eastern_europe/h5lqcpy/,filosoful,1626590072

3829,"&gt; I honestly have no idea how in the world our politicians think this a good idea

I mean, if Portugal doesn't do something, between the combination of net emigration and a sub-replacement fertility rate, it's gonna have a huge population collapse.

Of the options it has, all of which have drawbacks or difficulties, I think I'd do what Portugal is doing too.

1. Bring Portugal's fertility rate up.  This is really hard ‚Äî states have not met with success in their programs to do this.  I'll believe that there's a way to do this, but if so, a number of other countries have failed to pull it off.  We do know something about what *doesn't* work.

2. Accept immigrants.  Portugal went for ex-colonies, so it's probably gonna get people with the most cultural similarity of all the people it can pull in from the outside world, and maybe that'll help reduce friction.

Portugal can also mitigate the economic impact via a couple of things ‚Äî though none of these alone will not solve the long-term population sustainability issue unless it produces #1 or #2:

1. Convince Portuguese who have left to work in other EU members to return.  That's probably gonna be difficult.  There are few cases where the net migration flow is from a poorer area to a wealthier area.

2. Get the EU to institute a transfer union that internalizes some of the costs of intra-EU migration.  That will partially mitigate the wealth disparity and reduce emigration and I'd argue that the EU should have done this back when it instituted free movement of labor, but it doesn't look like all EU members are willing to do this at the moment.  It would mean a less short-term advantageous deal for the wealthiest EU members, so the strongest opposition ia probably gonna be there.

3. Leave the EU.  That will economically isolate Portugal, though it will likely make it harder for Portuguese citizens to emigrate and may reduce population bleed to wealthier EU members.

4. Produce a ""new Industrial Revolution"".  Some sort of new technological advancement that dramatically makes a Portuguese person able to produce much more than any other person in the world.  I think that it is likely very difficult to do this ‚Äî it's more statistically- likely that such a breakthrough would occur somewhere else in the world.  It would also require Portugal to retain exclusive access to this technology for an extended period of time, which I think is probably very difficult in the modern, interconnected world.  A reproduction of the [Great Divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Divergence), where Europe retained technological disparity with most of the world for several centuries, seems very unlikely to me today.  And in the long run, unless this produced a [positive feedback loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback) where Portugal could acquire technology ever-more-quickly, it will only be temporary in relative benefits ‚Äî and what we see today globally is the opposite, with poorer nations tending to ""catch up"" to wealthier ones.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/omcal5/portugal_signs_freedom_of_movement_treaty_with/h5ldon0/,duisThias,1626581524

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_conclave

&gt;To resolve prolonged deadlocks in papal elections in the earlier years, local authorities often resorted to the forced seclusion of the cardinal electors, such as first in the city of¬†Rome¬†in¬†1241, and possibly before that in¬†Perugia¬†in¬†1216.¬†In¬†1269, when the forced seclusion of the cardinals alone failed to produce a pope, the city of Viterbo refused to send in any materials except bread and water. When even this failed to produce a result, the townspeople removed the roof of the¬†Palazzo dei Papi¬†in their attempt to speed up the election.
&gt;
&gt;In an attempt to avoid future lengthy elections, Gregory X introduced stringent rules with the 1274 promulgation of¬†*Ubi periculum*. Cardinals were to be secluded in a closed area and not accorded individual rooms. No cardinal was allowed, unless ill, to be attended by more than two servants. Food was supplied through a window to avoid outside contact.¬†After three days of the conclave, the cardinals were to receive only one dish a day; after another five days, they were to receive just bread and water. During the conclave, no cardinal was to receive any ecclesiastical revenue.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/om6y6k/its_germany_vs_italy_in_standoff_over_top_finance/h5lfada/,duisThias,1626582463

3888,"Nadia ComƒÉneci, (born November 12, 1961, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej \[now One»ôti\], Romania), is a Romanian gymnast who was the first gymnast to be awarded a perfect score of 10 in an Olympic event.

Nadia was discovered by Bela Karolyi, later the Romanian gymnastics coach, when she was six years old. In her first international competition as a senior, in 1975, she bested the Russian Lyudmila Turishcheva, the five-time European champion, winning four gold medals and one silver. She won the American Cup in New York City in 1976, becoming the first woman to perform a backward double salto as a dismount from the uneven parallel bars.

At the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, ComƒÉneci received seven perfect scores and won the gold medals for the balance beam, the uneven bars, and the all-around individual competition. She won a silver medal as a member of her team and a bronze medal for the floor exercises. 

After the 1976 Games, she was named a Hero of Socialist Labour by her country. The song used to accompany her floor exercises was retitled ‚ÄúNadia‚Äôs Theme (The Young and the Restless)‚Äù and became an international hit, earning a Grammy Award in 1977. She finished a disappointing fourth in the world championships in 1978, however, and was out of competition during most of 1979 with an infected hand. 

At the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, she won gold medals for the beam and the floor exercises (tying for first in the latter event with Nelli Kim of the U.S.S.R.). She won a silver medal as a member of her team and tied with Maxi Gnauck of East Germany for second place in the all-around individual competition. She retired from competition in 1984.

Nadia ComƒÉneci defected to the United States in 1989; she became a U.S. citizen in 2001. In 1996 she married American gymnast Bart Conner, with whom she thereafter worked to promote gymnastics.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/omjxir/18_july_1976_at_the_olympic_games_in_montreal_the/h5lia3d/,capcaunul,1626584315

4041,"Okey, I am not going to go on a lengthy debate at 3:00 in the morning. I am just going to explain my positions really quick:

1) Citizenship to a *nation-state* is the modern, post-napoleonic concept. Belonging to a nation was absolutely a thing before then. Greeks had Greek-only games (they were called Olympics, you might have heard them), would band together to fight outside invasions like the Persian invasions and would recognize each other as belonging to the same peoples even while they went to war with each other. The same was true for other nations too, like Gallic people who would frequently band together even though they all lived in separate tribes. 

2) Alexander the great was from the tribe of Macedonia, which was a Greek tribe. Modern Greece is a direct inheritor of ancient Greece's culture and language and Greeks living in Greece typically are direct descendants of ancient Greeks, something that has been proven by numerous DNA tests. This isn't really a matter of debate.

3) North Macedonia does, indeed, have fuck all to do with ancient Macedon, being a slavic nation which came to the general region 9 centuries after Alexander the great's death, has no cultural connection, doesn't speak the same language and isn't even in the exact same region.",He does it for free,/r/europe/comments/om8o1j/the_official_presenting_of_a_fridge_in_a_police/h5kkw4c/,Greekball,1626566450

Mishandling the issue massively and then claiming to be the defender of Europe for building a fence doesn't sell well to most people, and that's exactly how things look in retrospect. Even our own government focuses the media spotlight onto the barbed wire and soldiers, not the administrative and police systems that should be at the forefront of dealing with illegal migration. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most Europeans probably agree with the concept of controlling Europe's borders but didn't agree with the way Hungary handled the crisis. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I doubt that normal, broke migrants are buying trips on a Ukrainian's speedboat, this guy was likely transporting a mix of contraband and people associated with criminal groups in Europe. The payout from a poor migrant family is too small to make trafficking them in a speedboat economical.

No, graphs are what they are imo, and I wouldn't say Euro was/is bad.

She was detained outside the walls of the Kremlin, making her the first person in the history of Russia to be detained for participating in VR IRL.  
Nenasheva wrote on Facebook that arresting officers told her that, ‚Äú‚Ä¶it‚Äôs strictly forbidden to be in virtual reality in a public place. Here it‚Äôs the real world.‚Äù  
According to Nenasheva, the officers asked her questions like: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in what reality? That one or this one?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo you think it‚Äôs okay to break social norms?‚Äù They went on to tell her that her actions were hurting others.  
She ended up in a locked room of a psychiatric ward, where psychiatrists inspected her glasses, asked her what her project was, then asked her to sign a document stating she had entered the hospital voluntarily. When she refused, she was sent to another psychiatric institution in Moscow.

&gt;  
&gt;It sounds like that would just take the wind out of the sails of the economy and lead to stagnation.

I think that depends on the specific country policies. Unions have a place and taxes are necessary to fund public services. But in the UK, the Labour government was ideologically opposed to the idea of a capitalist living off the profits from his investment. A top tax rate of 98% wasn't designed to raise money for the government to spend, it was designed to make it impossible for the rich to live off their investments. (Indeed the government admitted as much, calling them ""punitive"" rates, with the Chancellor once saying he would ""tax the rich until the pips squeak"".",,/r/europe/comments/om09ar/gdp_per_capita_in_italy_was_986_of_germanys/h5ilhga/,WhiteSatanicMills,1626530395

4573,"&gt;Look up trepƒça mine and camp bondsteel.

Trepƒça mine is run by Kosovo government directly. The Kosovo government receives all income from that mine. Allow me to reiterate my question: How does America profit from it? And how does America profit from Camp Bondsteel? Rather, maintaining that camp costs it money, but it does so, to keep an eye on Kosovo - where it has intervened also on basis of human rights issues.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Also the ethnic cleansing happened AFTER America started bombing Serbia, look it up. Im sure they care about kosovo because of the innocent people, thats why they helped out in Bosnia and Rwanda am I right? And just to tell you, the EU doesnt recocgnize Kosovo.

And who caused the ethnic cleansing? The Milo≈°eviƒç government. Before NATO intervened, a whole year before, by april 1998, the Serbian offensive into Kosovo has already caused [260 000 refugees](https://web.archive.org/web/20140808211326/http://sitemaker.umich.edu/drwcasebook/files/the_kosovo_report_and_update.pdf) according to UNHCR. There have been many instances of killings of civilians, abuse of civilians. By january 1999, the massacre in Raƒçak happened. I know you will say now, that KLA has also attacked civilians and it would be true, but its activities have not led to such a scale of human suffering. This wasn't something that would be just transitory either. Albanians were denied rights - they could have no political parties, their university was shut down. Serbia was acting as a brute occupying force.

You note Bosnia and Rwanda, and I should point out - NATO intervened in Bosnia and stopped Serbian forces there. It hasn't intervened in Rwanda, and that is why the west, looking at the genocide in retrospect, did not want a repeat of that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But we didnt invade Kosovo, it was literally ours. We were fighting against the KLA which was a terrorist organasation, for fucks sake even America classified them as terrorists. The NATO intervention wasnt legal according to the UN, so no its not the same.

Legally it was a part of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. That country used to also insist that Croatia and Bosnia are a part of it. Serbia didn't just fight the KLA, Serbia was being opposed by Kosovars at large. The was province under martial law since 1989. There were widespread protests back then that were not armed. You are in effect the invader if you do fight the vast majority of the country, and drive out so many of its people. And when you, not as a person, or a Serb, but as the invader, do end up doing the ethnic cleansing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Even if UN does not recognise Kosovo as a country now it doesn't mean that it would allow Serbian army to roll in  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes it will because its our territory. We wouldnt be killing anyone.  


But the UN doesn't do it even now. I don't think Europeans would allow it in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But suppose you would be right, UN packs up, Europeans leave, what happens then? A million Albanians just continues to live as usual and will have no qualms about being a part of the state that tried to ethnically cleanse them, as was admitted in 2004 by Serbian foreigm minister Dra≈°koviƒç.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes, they will have to. They cant fight back, they are too weak. The KLA hasnt won a single battle against the Serbian millitary or even the Serbian police, the only thing that they knew how to do is kill civillians. Those Albanians that wont accept that they are a part of Serbia will just move out, they already are.

&amp;#x200B;

See, but then we're just back in 1998 when Serbia tries to dominate Kosovo which doesn't want to be a part of it. So they would disobey the government. If people disobey the government, what will it do? It would use force. Which will make people resist force with force. And we're back in 1998 and at war. Maybe in a very low level one, but a neverending one.

4601,"In regard population ""replacement"" (your ""not enough people to repopulate the territory"") that's a very dubious and recent maximalist trend in spanish historiography, but even more on ""popular vision of History"", since late XIX century, but specially popular **post 1939**, which is absolutely unjustified and contrary to the data we have. In the ""sangre limpia y repoblaciones"" model (old christian blood and resettlement) 3/4 or even 4/5 of Iberian Peninsula would have been emptied/ethnically cleansed of its native population, replaced by the constant arrival of northern ""repobladores"". This model would have a huge impact in modern populations and cultures not only in Spain but in the Maghreb which would have been flooded by native iberian muslim populations in a time when all Maghreb had similar population to Al-Andalus. Morocco would have more iberian ancestry from the southern 3/4 of  the Peninsula that Spain and Portugal. It's ridiculous. The distribution of genetic markers across Iberia doesn't favour that theory, but the genetic composition of Maghreb it's even less compatible with the mass expulsions model.

There were ""repartimientos"" (land distribution) among victors and the arrival of numerous northern inmigrants and there were equally numerous arrivals of andalusis to Morocco, Algeria or Tunisia during late medieval times, but it's obvious that big sectors of native iberian muslim population remained and converted (back) to Christianity after different christian conquests.  It's very significative that when anti-convert clean blood laws were created at XV centuries, the ""limit"" for christian ancestry was established at 200-250 years before the individual, so after the last and biggest great northern conquest wave at XIII century started.

On the other hand the population pattern at Al-Andalus, roman or pre-roman times doesn't seem to have been extremely different from current (besides the rural depopulation, which it's a recent, XIX century, phenomenon). The ""regional"" distribution doesn't favour that theory neither, with big concentrations of population in the South and East since the first sources we have at late medieval times, bigger or much bigger than the North. Andalusia, Extremadura, Murcia and Valencia were much more populated at 1400 than all oceanic Spain + northernmost leonese and old castilian territories + Navarre + ""old"" Aragon and Catalonia and northern Spain remained much less populated than South and East until XVII-XVIII century at least. Central Spain, most Castile proper, remained equally much more populated during late medieval and early modern age than the North.",,/r/europe/comments/oljqzl/population_density_map_of_europe_according_to_the/h5i9niv/,Arganthonios_Silver,1626522708

###Enschede keeps a close eye on 3D printed bridge with sensors: M√°xima delivers first data

‚àí‚àí Frank Timmers

Queen M√°xima walks across the metal bridge she opened from the 3D printer. In doing so, she is providing the first data to the University of Twente, which is analyzing how the bridge is holding up.


ENSCHEDE/AMSTERDAM - In her high heels, Queen M√°xima inaugurated a wondrous bridge in Amsterdam on Thursday, on which students from the University of Twente (UT) were jumping and stamping two years ago. The UT will continue to monitor how this world first holds up in the coming years.
Frank Timmers 16-07-21, 08:07

The special thing about the bridge is that it is printed in one piece. According to the municipality of Amsterdam, it is even the first of its kind in the world. It connects the quays of the Oudezijds Achterburgwal and was designed by Borculo-born designer Joris Laarman.

Making objects in one piece and with 3D printers offers designers unprecedented possibilities and freedom. This is reflected in the shape of the bridge, which seems to undulate and flow like water. The all-steel span of 6000 kilograms, over 12 meters long and 6 wide, should provide a lot of information about how this kind of design holds up in use.

And in that, the University of Twente plays a major role. That began in 2019 when the bridge was laid out in a tent on campus for testing. Researchers looked at the extent to which heat and cold led to deformation, and students were allowed to walk over it to see if it was strong enough. ""The bridge is absolutely safe,"" says doctoral engineer Farid Vahdatikhaki of the Engineering Technology faculty.
September 2019 the bridge will arrive at the University of Twente where students will be the first to test it.

He is playing a leading role in further, international research into how a bridge printed from a piece of steel holds up. Vahdatikhaki explains that the bridge is equipped with nearly 100 sensors that continuously transmit information that is analyzed.

""It took a lot of thought to incorporate the sensors and wires as invisibly as possible and vandal-proof,"" he says. The safety status is monitored in real time.

The sensors relay how much weight the bridge is carrying, keep track of its temperature, tell about tension and stretching forces, and collect data on noise from the surrounding area. ""We want to know everything that could affect it. In theory, that could include the frequency of sound,"" says the assistant professor.

Cameras will also record how people use the bridge. How many people go over it, where do they walk the most, where do they stay? All that kind of data the developers want to know in order to learn from it for future designs. ""There is only one of these in the world. All eyes are on this,"" says Vahdatikhaki.

The scientist explains that new norms and standards need to be developed for printed forms. ""A traditional bridge consists of all kinds of parts and it is exactly clear what they have to comply with. But for a one-piece printed bridge, there is no standard at all,"" he outlines the situation. Printed steel also behaves differently from 'ordinary' steel.
Farid Vahdatikhaki of the University of Twente: ""Almost 100 sensors continuously measure all kinds of influences on and forces in the bridge.""

What that will look like in the future, he does not yet dare to say. It is possible that standards will be less relevant if objects continuously tell us what their condition is and when maintenance is required where. In short, this new production method is turning the world of design upside down.

Because the smart bridge continuously collects so much data that also concerns the users, there is a task for the Faculty of Behavioural, Management and Social Sciences of the UT. Its researchers are examining the ethical issue of a society full of objects that are constantly collecting information.

Questions such as: 'What do we as citizens actually want to be measured?', 'Who owns the collected data?' and 'Do we really want a city full of sensors? 

The bridge was printed by MX3D of Gijs van der Velden. He articulates its significance as follows: ""We have shown that it is possible to print large in metal. With this new technology we can produce metal structures, without wasting material and flexible in form and style.""

4688,"Reposting my comment.

&gt;The initial period of post-revolution reforms was a massive improvement on what had come before.

The economy of 1913 wasn't reached until 1928. Life in Russia during 1917-1924 was the life of death, hunger and suffering. Millions died in famines. Bolsheviks established concentration camps, stole food from the peasants, established sadistic secret police, abol√≠shed rule of law, abolished freedom of speech, gathering and movements, abolished freedom to protest. Massacred Kronstadt sailors, massacred 40K Tambov peasants. Butchered Ukrainian Anarchists. Attacked and enslaved the Caucaus and central Asian nations. Deported tens of thousands at least. People lost all their life savings in inflation. They had to barter to survive.

Where the hell did you read that there were ""improvements"" in anything??? Which serious historian claims that? Do you actually know anything about this topic apart from weird Bolshevik propaganda points from the 30s???

&gt;but the rapid industrialisation was a massive and material improvement in the lives of regular people.

Do you mean under Stalin, when literally millions of innocent people died because of it, and many of the factories were built by actual slave labour, which was banned during the Czarist regime?

That is ""good"" according to you????

Had the tsar done this, would you have supported that as a good policy??? You are saying that he is so evil and repressive...

&gt;After Stalin died, many thousands of commoners went to pay their respects despite the horrific repression he had caused.

And what? Hitler was popular among Germans as well, Franco too in Spain. You think that makes anything better??? The Tsar is adored in modern Russia by millions as well. He is a saint. What do you think about that???

&gt;The tsar, meanwhile, was just oppressive with no redeeming features, which is why the revolution happened.

Revolution happened when Tsar stepped down after conservative generals persuaded him to.

Bolshevik usurpation of power is a completely different topic and the Tsar was completely irrelevant by this time, living in a farmhouse. It was a battle of various democratic (cadets, SRs, Mensheviks) or totalitarian (Bolsheviks) radical movements wanting to build a new state.

&gt;As for Lenin, his hand was often forced due to foreign powers trying to interfere immediately after the revolution; they were under immediate attack, which probably pushed him towards a ""siege mentality"".

A popular Bolshevik myth.

No ""power"" ever actively tried to remove the Bolsheviks from power, there is zero evidence to it. If you find any document proving it, please post it here.

On the other hand, Bolsheviks actively tried to undermine the governments of Bavaria, Hamburg, Hungary, Poland, Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Finland and even Italy.

&gt;The Tsardom was oppressive for no reason and treated its commoners like shit. Lenin was oppressive for a (arguably pretty weak) reason and improved the lives of the commoners massively.

In that case, you will find it surprising that workers had more rights during the empire. Bolsheviks removed the right to form independent unions and the right to protest, which were granted after the 1905 revolution. Funny, isn't it?

Peasants were literally made serf again, just like in the 18th century.

Serfdom Soviet union

Land belongs to tsar(not peasant)Land bel. to state (not peasant)

You cant leave You cant leave (until the 70s!!)

Surplus exploited surplus exploited

No wage no wage (until the 70s!!!)

They fucking reestablished politically correct serfdom.

&gt;The bolshevik rule was massively flawed, and once Stalin came around it even became cruel, but calling them much worse than the tsardom is a massive underestimation of just how terrible it was prior to the revolution.

So why didn't the peasants rebel against the terrible tsardom, but they did rebel against the Bolsheviks virtually hundreds of times????

Tambov peasant slaughter

Peasant rebellion of Sorokino

PEASANT UPRISINGS

And hundreds of others....

Of course, with a still galloping world population and standards of living still anchored on models from last century, the global energy demand is bound to strill increase in the next decades.

I don't remember how much excess carbon dioxide is already in the atmosphere nor what would be the enormous energy balance for its capture, but I am pretty certain that there is simply not enough room on Earth to sequester it.

4821,"Or this acticle from the BANCA D'ITALIA

*Based on updated datasets of value added and of labour and capital inputs, this paper provides a reassessment of the proximate causes of Italy‚Äôs economic development since its political unification in 1861 to 2016. Italy‚Äôs pre-WWII economy featured weak productivity growth, with the exception of the Giolitti era and the 1920s. Italy then embarked on an exceptional catching-up process relative to the technological leaders during the Golden Age. Compared with the pre-WWII years, when the Italian economy was held back by slow productivity growth in the large agricultural sector, the catching-up process during the Golden Age was propelled by the rapid shift of labour out of agriculture. As in many countries, this rapid growth in productivity could not be sustained after 1973, but the further slowdown since the 1990s has been more pronounced in Italy than elsewhere.* ***The disappointing performance of the Italian economy since the early 1990s is largely explained by slow labour productivity growth in the now dominant services sector and by sluggish aggregate total factor productivity.*** *Labour productivity developments actually turned negative during the protracted crisis following the global financial turmoil, due to the decline in capital accumulation and in total factor productivity. Since the start of the recovery in 2013, while total factor productivity has returned to a moderately positive trend, the capital stock has not fully overcome the legacy of the crisis.*

There are still many different species left, so not a monoculture. Some of the plants are also removed.

It's good to clearcut, it increases biodiversity becasue it supports insects, mushrooms, lichens and other plants that needs the disturbance.

[Major English hospital cancels vital operations as Covid admissions rise](https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/birmingham-hospital-cancels-operations-covid-19/)

&gt; Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham has announced that all elective operations have been cancelled for 48 hours due to a shortage of intensive care beds, as Covid admissions rise.

&gt; Dozens of elective surgeries scheduled to happen on Thursday or Friday - including life saving liver transplants - were cancelled as the ICU was full to capacity.

&gt; The hospital has urged locals to get a Covid jab as cases and hospital admissions rise.

&gt; A spokesperson for University Hospitals Birmingham Trust said the cancelling and rescheduling of operations was forced ""as a result of the number of very sick patients requiring emergency care"".

&gt; ""This is also contributed to by increasing numbers of inpatients with Covid requiring critical care,"" they explained.

About Kurdish people's situation in Turkey I agree completely, it is not normal.

About Cyprus it is a different topic. Following how Cretan Turks (who were actually muslim Greeks speaking Turkish) were killed or ethnically cleansed by Greek nationalists. It was obvious that same can happen in Cyprus, so under a formation of Cypriot state, a complex constitution of power sharing was introduced. Everybody agreed on the terms, except of EOKA and EOKA-B leader Grivas who failed to recognize the independent Republic. Turks had a proportionally big rights here but not something special. 30% of parliament and ministerial offices was still a minority, not something super-rewarding as you claim. The only bigger right was veto but it was understood as vital for survival of Turkish Cypriot community since Enosis was still a popular idea for Greek leaders.

Humans are causing a lot of shit with pollution, deforestation, desertification etc. Those are the big things to focus on.

But after listening to some meteorological reports, I fail to see how this disasterous particular flood (which follows the exact same weather pattern as one that happened in I believe 1880s) is connected to human activity. Other than with the damage scale due to the settlement-river proximity. Floods happen. They were happening when we were still on horsebacks cause nature is powerful and mighty. It's extremely unfortunate but there's no way to stop it. We have to adapt to floods by better urban planning, agricultural planting diversity, effective insurance mechanisms and intergovernmental &amp; national help in crisis management.

We're not just gonna magically build some wind turbines, elect green-centered politicians and dominate how nature and climate will develop as if we are some planetary overlords.

&gt;I think, I hope, Europeans are better poised to deal with disaster like this.

Unfortunately, it's a little the opposite. This is probably the worst natural disaster at least of the last couple centuries in Germany, so people aren't super prepared for it.

The first responders know what they're doing, of course, but I've seen a bunch of videos and reports of people doing the things any American who lives in a flood zone is taught not to do in floods like trying to get things out of basements, trying to drive through standing water, or even trying to walk through knee-high water -- all understandable but very dangerous things to do.

On top of that, Germany doesn't have a GSM-based emergency warning system like we do. So emergency warnings go out via an app -- but obviously, only to people who have installed the app, and only if the internet is working. And nobody here has those FEMA mobile cell tower trucks that they use when cell service is out 


And because a lot of the flash-flooding only really set in overnight on Wednesday night, a lot of people and communities were completely blindsided by it even though the EU weather warning services had actually been warning for a couple of days. And for example the regional public broadcaster (WDR) didn't manage to put out any information about it until 10am the next morning, almost a full 11 hours after the first life-threatening flash-floods.

I am already getting the vibe that this is a huge wakeup call for a lot of Germans both in terms of emergency management (I'm betting a universal emergency warn system that doesn't rely on an app will be implemented in the next couple of years) and also in terms of climate change.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/olcw3y/a_flooded_and_eroding_quarry_has_swallowed_houses/h5gk27n/,IncidentalIncidence,1626479666

5264,"First of all, we are talking about the next 25 years only. Afterwards Germany will be carbon-neutral. So what is going to happen during these 25 years? Germany is going to cut down one carbon-based power production site after the other. This means at any point of time there will be unused capacity around that could be reactivated in times of need.

Second, Germany is in the middle of Europe. There are loads of alternative sources of energy around. More expensive gas from elsewhere including LNG, but also other forms of energy. 

And third, there are massive gas storages in Germany.

So, no Germany will never be dependent on Russia. And frankly speaking, assuming that a high-tech engineering-based country like Germany would take the risk of running into energy dependency from Russia (or would be too stupid to notice so) is really a weird assumption.

Finally, regarding the topic of this thread, much ado about nothing. Germany will ditch the project after the elections in September anyway.

5276,"Very mature way to start a reply.  Are you seriously, honest to God going to pull the ""no true communism"" card?  I don't think I can stand to hear that one more time.  If sociologists were championing such a fantasy version of communism that it was literally unattainable, what does that say about the sociologists?  What does that say about their ability to craft sound theories?  Where did I say all leftists are communists, could you point me to that sentence?  I said leftist intellectuals gave us communism as well as socialism, and it was very much in vogue before the horrors of the USSR were too blatant to ignore.  It is puzzling you would say it wasn't championed, because it was very much championed in fields like sociology for a very long time.  The point was that it was in vogue among many academics precisely because in much of the social sciences, there was no way to test their theories.  They developed them and championed them, and it took the horrors of them being implemented before they realized they were egregiously incorrect.  

I already said they use descriptive statistics.  What they can't do is make quantified predictions.  It is all very much post hoc and without any robust underpinnings.  They can't be checked because sociologists cannot run controlled experiments, they are always describing phenomena after the fact.  With what data they do have, they are never able to predict future results with any accuracy.  It has led many to question whether or not it is even a science at all, because the core of the scientific principle is the ability to make predictions.  

Of course people don't listen to them, there is no rigor in any of their findings.  They cannot accurately make predictions, so why would people trust them to prescribe solutions?  There is a very good reason they are called a soft ""science"".  They are nothing like the STEM fields.  This leads to biased thinking and activist scholars, but rarely any scientific work.  If people would have taken taken seriously in the past, they would have thought socialism was the best way forward.  Luckily for Americans, we let some other countries enact sociologists theories.  The leftists that try to ""fix"" problems follow political narratives more than anything.  That is why you see an inordinate amount of activists in fields like sociology.  It is why up to half of their papers cannot even be reproduced.  If you want to talk about stupidity, I think you will find it in people who view the field as having a large amount of credence.

And in natural disasters like the one right now in Central Europe, these houses would be gone completley. With all of the property these people had.  
Most of the European houses will only need renovation after this. Which is cheaper than an American house. Additionally large parts of the things they own will still be within the house. Everything that can survive getting wet can still be reused. This can save loads of money. Additionally lots of the houses weren't flooded completley, but only in the lowest story. That means, there will be perfectly livable spaces in the stories above, where nothing got detroyed. If the people had enough time to store their valuables upstairs they will still be fine. Not so in American houses which would collapse from these kinds of currents.

American houses are cheap. But if you want to get through a natural disaster with minimal structural and financial damage you need to build european.

5366,"Left wing intellectuals gave us and championed communism for the longest time, the problem with those fields is that they aren't quantitative beyond descriptive statistics.  There is no ability to check for their correctness.  They fall victim to ideas being viewed as correct according to the popular views in the field.  For example, results in physics forced physicists to develop quantum physics.  They tried every other possible explanation under the sun because the ideas of waves of probabilities weren't palatable or intuitive.  But the empirical results forced their hand.  There is no such inherent ability to check theories against reality in many of the social sciences.  This is how communism flourished in those same fields when it was abstract, it took decades of terrible results before they were forced to retreat from them.  And they fought it terribly along the way.  When it is all abstract, it is easy for one to develop hypotheses that might sound correct and have the backing of eminent professors, but we rarely know if any of them are true.   In complex phenomena like a society, there are so many variables and so many possible theories which could affect outcomes, just trying to aptly understand it let alone prescribe solutions for it is an almost impossible task.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/olkocx/german_sociologist_on_the_eu_decentralization_or/h5g75eo/,quaternaryprotein,1626473294

5691,"You have misunderstood.

This is non-standard English, where we talk about the past as if we are in the present tense for dramatic or comic effect. Your 'correction' destroys that effect. Here are some examples:

""I **was** standing in line, and **I'm** thinking 'how long **is** this going to take?'

""In 1940 Britain **had** suffered a military catastrophe at Dunkirk, and **stands** alone against the Nazi war machine""

This is uncommon in written language, and would be inappropriate for a formal document. However in narrative writing it is somewhat common, and in spoken English (especially when telling a story) it is very common.

5858,"&gt; That's not how it works. You can still consider yourself a muslim

As an ex-Muslim, trust me, I'm very well aware how it works. For example, if you miss three D≈æuma prayers, then you're no longer a Muslim as far as the Quran is concerned, but you can go around saying you're Muslim despite that.

&gt; Doesn't matter, in both cases it's a personal choice that should not obligate third parties to accommodate you.

The difference is that for Muslim women, it's a sin to not wear cover up outside. You're saying ""if you wanna work here, you have to commit a sin"".
