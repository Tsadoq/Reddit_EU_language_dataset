Yes and no. I think you're too Russified and that this would cause problems integrating you into our broader culture.

Also, your Russian speaking minorities would have to be accommodated, and that would be a hassle.

IF we don't retain their autonomous status. That would be very problematic in a number of areas.

Exactly. Those who want to be Romanians, already are, thanks to Basescu. Moldova is basically a non-state, half of its citizens are citizens of another state, too. What's the issue, then?

Also keep in mind that your data shows +1C in 20 years - if that speed keeps up, you'll get another +3C until you're a senior. (And another +6C for the heat waves, yay!)

216,"&gt;A detailed report by the Civitas think tank made shortly after the 2016 referendum, however, cast some doubt on that. Acknowledging that there had been an apparent rise in harassment, the report noted a climate where many crimes were assumed as hate or Brexit-linked, ‚Äúeven when there is no evidence to suggest that they are.‚Äù 

So if I get this right, there has been an increase in harrasment to non-brits after the referendum (I do anecdotically remember this spanish person being harrassed and I don't know if also hit). However the author points that this has not necessarily been linked to brexit.

What? How can it unequivocally be linked to Brexit? Should they jump on people while wearing UKIP t-shirts and screaming ""rule brittannia is what we want after brexit and this is why I'm harrassing you""?

What the hell. To me is pretty obvious that if you make people more politically agitated and blame many things on the EU, then people will react accordingly and there might be an increase in harrasment against europeans... Which is what we observed.

I read the whole article looking for points to prove myself wrong, in the belief that a substantial percentage of the leave voters hold nationalistic views that would make them support policies that get Britain as close as possible to their idea of how Britain should be (that is, closer to the empire times than today).

252,"Translation by deepl.com


In addition to letters to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki on TVN and to the Minister of Health on Roche's medicines, the US Ambassador Georgette Mosbacher arranged business in a similar way with the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk, as established by Fact. The fact reached the letter in which she demanded.... the abandonment of regulations that were to close the Polish market for Uber!

In short, Uber is a mobile application, which is used to order car transport by associating passengers with drivers using the application. Anyone who has a car can do it for a ""taxi"" in Ubera - without any licence, knowledge of the city or a certificate of no criminal record. Low price and easy access are a plus for customers. And it takes bread away from taxi drivers, because they have to add taxes, license costs and membership in a taxi corporation to the rate.

Uber was established in the USA. In several European countries governments have already banned Ubera. In Poland such announcements also appeared, but without specifics. Until 17 October. Then the infrastructure ministry unexpectedly - one day before the taxi drivers protested against Uber! - sent a bill on road transport to the legal committee of the Council of Ministers. The problem is that it was completely different from the one on which work has been going on for months, and which was evaluated by both Uber and taxi corporations.

Among other things, he introduced the need for an intermediary to have an entry in the register of economic activity or to have a number in the National Court Register, which practically blocked the possibility of Ubera's activity in Poland. A few days later, on 25 October, Mosbacher wrote a sharp letter to the minister. The U.S. Ambassador demanded that the project be abandoned and threatened that otherwise it might freeze the planned U.S. investments in Poland.

- She treated us like a banana republic. Although the minister explained to her that Uber was acting illegally in Poland, she was deaf to the arguments,"" says our interlocutor from the Prime Minister's Office, who also received a copy of the letter. This confirms our information that a meeting of the minister with Mosbacher took place in November. Soon afterwards there were leaks that despite Adamczyk's opposition, the subject of limiting Uber's activity in Poland is closed. - Maybe there will be some game of appearances, but before the elections nothing will happen, because nobody will stand up to our biggest ally,"" explains the source in the resort of Adamczyk.

259,"&gt;On the other hand, the UK is going to have to do the same. For example they will have to put a duty on Chinese steel to protect local manufacturers from collapsing.

You dont know a lot about how few shits the UK government gives about its people then. Or the number of steel smelting facilities that already have.

&gt;So you think it's more important to Ireland to sell their products to the UK in particular than it is for the UK to have those products? You think finding a new buyer is harder than establishing a new import line? Wow.

We've got the entire world and have had years now to prepare for it. Ireland has to find a new buyer within the EU which is basically failing and England just so happens to be one of the ones that's overcrowded as fuck (for some reason. No idea why cough cough freedom of movement in the EU cough cough) and needs the food. I think you're forgetting that England has the money it's just where to spend it. And if it's cheaper elsewhere we'll be shopping elsewhere.

&gt;Currently they have the joint EU regulations which are strict, and countries in South America might not be able to comply to them in the quantity the UK will need

And that's another reason. If the standards are far too strict along with the extra tariffs we ain't gonna get the best deal shopping outside the EU while we are in it. And only a 2.5 piece of all ghwctek

&gt;The last paragraph I meant that the UK is going to sign a new trade agreement with the EU as part of the leaving procedure. The EU has extra duties on sectors they want to protect from outside markets, which are significant. As part of the 'trade war' they imposed duties as high as 50% for specific product categories coming from the US.

And so staying in a bloc of failing countries (not all of them obvs. It's just the north west that seems to be any good tho. and maybe one or 2 in the eastern parts.) And paying more than any other of these countries apart from one is gonna do the UK more good than accepting basically free trade deals that AMERICA are offering to us basically for free and accepting trade with the entire rest of the world. Also can we look at the fact that countries outside of the eu trade with the EU. 

&gt;But that's not even a huge issue. The biggest issue is, before any trading can start, the UK will have to sign new trade agreements. With everyone. And as a small market, it's going to get worse terms than it got as a member of EU.

So far we've got murica flinging itself at us with open arms and legs and I'm fairly confident that one of the biggest contributors to the eu would soon find a use for all the money we ain't paying for membership to the people who proudly bring you article 13. We have literally spit in the face of every bad economic forecast that there has been for the past God knows how long Brexit has been going on.

Communist at that time really was just any movement that sought to overthrow capitalism through revolution instead of reform, so a pretty broad term. Stalinism is the totalitarian ideology that I probably don't have to elaborate on further.

Luxemburg and Liebknecht didn't want to install a totalitarian one party state, as others in this thread have pointed out.

&gt;It had been tried by the Russians. That's what soviet means.

Yes, and then, just a few years into the Bolshevist regime, Lenin stripped the Soviets of their power again. From then on, the ""soviet"" - part of ""Soviet Union"" was just meaningless propaganda

The SU did not become a totalitarian state by turning into a Soviet Republic (which Luxemburg and Liebknecht advocated), but precisely by getting rid of those democratic elements. ",,/r/europe/comments/afjxip/german_leftists_mark_100_years_since/ee0khx6/,jobjge,1547425414

* in austria, child support existed for decades, not ""thanks to √ñVP""
* for 2 kids, you would get sth between 250 and 350 EUR by default, depending on the age of the kids.  
this has nothing to do with √ñVP
* every couple of years, child support gets raised by a small percentage (last time it was &lt;2% iirc).  
this happens in order to adjust for inflation, and it is not something √∂vp invented.
* since 2019, 1.500 EUR per child will count against yearly income taxes. this new law was introduced by √ñVP/FP√ñ.  
however, there is no ""additional child support"", and claiming that ""families with children get several hundred EUR per month in additional child support"" is just plain wrong. depending on your income tax, you just have to pay less.
* the full amount of 1.500 ""child bonus"" can only be collected by families who already earn enough money. single moms and low income families are the very group that does not gain from this new rule.
* at the same time, some other tax deductables for child care etc have been eliminated.

tl;dr

generous child support always existed in austria.  
√ñVP just added some tax deductables that high income families profit from.",,/r/europe/comments/af7r70/sp√∂_recovers_in_austria_fp√∂_at_a_new_low_since/edzzqvm/,elhoozn,1547410637

&gt;We wont accept that a ship that sails from istanbul to antalya is forced to go through Greek waters.

Again i don't see why. It happens in many cases under the concept of Innocent Passage. It all boils down to you guys being butthurt about Greece being eligible to have more waters as per international law.

There is no serious reason, like i said above and your casus belli goes against the Charter of the UN.

&gt;Wanna talk of treaties? Why dont you Demilitarize your islands first as stated in lausanne?

Probably for the same reason that you still illegally occupy Cyprus. Turkey has violated almost every treaty it has signed. What did you do about the Greeks that you expelled against the treaty of Lausanne during the Istanbul pogroms? You break the treaty, you constantly violate the airspace above those islands (which is also against the treaty) and you still have troops in Cyprus so yeah :)

That happened during the first wave. They were safe after the first wave.

Your aim was clearly to occupy the island and that's why you still have troops there.

650,"Again youre showing your absolute ignorance towards whats actually going on in Germany, how the search for safe places to keep nuclear waste is going and how the legislation concerning nuclear energy in Germany was drafted. You being German would improve your knowledge on these points AND improve the believability of you claiming that ""the Germans went anti-nuclear because of fear"". German people have been anti-nuclear since the very beginning. There were protest against nuclear power plants before the first power plants were built in Germany. Noone ever wanted them here. We want renewable energy. So a comparison to coal like ive been seeing in this thread so far is completely inappropriate. Its like comparing the black death to cholera to me. One of them kills me or someone in the future and the other things kills me or someone in the future.

You dont know whats going on in Germany and it shows. You dont know how the search for storage facilities is going, why its taking forever and is likely never going to finish. You dont know what the protests looked like.

1. I have never said that they happen often. One leak per facility is enough to completely condemn the storage facilities because it shows that none of them are secure. And these leaks are happening within decades of them being taken into service. What is going to happen in these facilities in 50000 years? Is anyone even going to take care of them anymore? If not, what safeguards do we have against people just digging the stuff out or radiation leaking out?

2. Its been insiniuated to me by multiple people in this thread that Fukushima was the reason Germany got out of nuclear. I have no idea who im discussing against anymore because this discussion is so incredibly tiring that i dont even care.

3. It would improve your incredibly lackluster perspective on German environmental activism, societal climate, legislation and nuclear waste facilities.

4. The reason they have trouble finding safe places is because there are no ultimately safe places in the country of Germany to store this waste without having it leak for 100000 years. There have been leaks occuring from the facilities, from the containers, there are basically irretrievable containers full of radioactive waste locked in a salt mine thats going to leak into nearby water supplies at some point.

The voters have 0 impact on wether or not the facility will be in that area or not and you arguing this way shows again that you dont know how the search for storage facilities works in Germany. The facilities are chosen by a commission on the federal government. To find suitable storage spaces they have scientists looking into wether or not these facilities are safe. All of the ones looked into so far have shown flaws that would lead to leaks and radioactive contamination. This has nothing to do with wether or not the locals like the idea of having this facility nearby.

5. Me being German has a lot of effect on me knowing how fucking Germany tries to find storage for its spent nuclear fuel and how nuclear radiation might affect GERMANY. Its called German news. Since youre not German I wouldnt assume that you watch and read it on a daily basis.


Noone is screaming in terror at a picture of an atom and it is a clear exxageration. Anti-nuclear people in Germany are people like climate scientists, environmental activists, the Green party, the left party, 80% of the German population (but oh im sorry ""people"" in general are just stupid so none of these groups being against nuclear energy in Germany would show that there might be some kind of reason behind it?)

German scientists are advocating against nuclear energy. Do they stand for math and science or is their objection to nuclear energy also based on fear?

On the cost; you seem to be following the belief that I dont want unification because of the cost,  I dont have any desire to expand my countries borders, not out of malice, or to troll but because i dont see Northern Ireland as being inherently part of the republic. Obviously i dont see the reason why i should suffer any tax increase to send aid to northern ireland for no good reason. Im sure if there is a referendum studies will be done and we will get a clearer picture of the cost.

Now i said no good reason but you are saying the benefits to ireland that would justify the cost would be the increase of the irish market, but in many cases we have that already by being part of the EU single market, whether i buy from amazon.ie, amazon.co.uk or amazon.de(which seems cheaper than the UK one), i dont really mind. most tech companies already have substantial presence in the republic (amazon/google/facebook in dublin, apple in cork, blizard in galway, Blacknights in Carlow etc) having an additional work force is a benefit, but with the EU freedom of movement that gives the same benefit without the cost. Regarding moving jobs from Dublin to Belfast, why not just increase taxes to invest in housing around the country?

I did an exchange program when I was 16 (Itzehoe up way north) then studied there for almost two years in college (Konstanz). Here were my observations:
1. When 16 my host family took me to Berlin to see relatives. This was 1991 and relatives were East German. I couldn‚Äôt believe how many buildings while restored were still pick marked with bucket holes. East Berlin was still a dump hole and insanely ‚Äúeastern bloc‚Äù still. 
2. When we left Berlin they took me down to Dresden. What was left of it was absolutely beautiful, but almost 50 years later and there were still sections of the city that were bombed out. The East German govt apparently never got around to dealing with those blocks. 
3. Having lived and traveled all over that country you could tell the level of influence and power it had within the Nazi war machine based on how many old buildings it had. You would be walking through one and just say to yourself ‚Äúoh my we bombed the living shit out of this town‚Äù.

It's hard to predict exactly. But the infrastructure investments will still be useful for a renewable energy economy, so it's not a risk or wasted time and funds in that regard. That's important, yes.

We also don't want to run before we can walk: if we commit to a total switch and we get occasional brownouts because batteries can cover us 99% of the time, but not 100% (still a very good performance and I would personally accept it), that would be a PR disaster for renewables, and will hurt the cause more in the long term.

Where information society service providers offer users content storage services and provide the public with access to content and where such activity is not eligible for the liability exemptions provided for in Directive 2000/31/EC, they shall take appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure the functioning of licensing agreements concluded with rightholders. The implementation of such agreements shall respect the fundamental rights of users and shall not impose a general obligation on information society service providers to monitor the information which they transmit or store, in accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2000/31/EC.
1a.  For the purpose of ensuring the functioning of licensing agreements, as referred to in paragraph 1, information society service providers and rightholders shall cooperate with each other. Rightholders shall accurately identify to information society service providers the works or other subject-matter in respect of which they have the copyright. The information society service providers shall inform rightholders of the measures employed and the accuracy of their functioning as well as, when relevant, periodically report on the use of the works and other subject-matter.
2.  Member States shall ensure that the service providers referred to in paragraph 1 in cooperation with rightholders put in place complaints mechanisms that are available to users in case of disputes over the implementation of the licensing agreements referred to in paragraph 1.
2a.  Member States shall ensure that users have access to a court or another competent authority for the purpose of asserting their right of use under an exception or limitation and to appeal any restrictive measures agreed upon pursuant to paragraph 3.
3.  Member States shall facilitate, where appropriate, the cooperation between the information society service providers referred to in paragraph 1, user representatives and rightholders through stakeholder dialogues to define best practices for the implementation of paragraph 1. The measures undertaken shall be appropriate and proportionate and shall take into account, among others, the nature of the services, the availability of the technologies and their effectiveness in light of technological developments.

The bigger problem is that it's ineficient and we're very bad at distributing them due to state sovereignty, and the states are generally not great at integrating them.

By contrast I'd say America is much better at this. When people flee to America as their promised land and make a life for themselves, they can then become an American citizen, etc. No European state has that same mythos, and very often people just want to flee to 'Europe' which is their utopian destination. But then they get to some country they don't really care for and they can't really become European or European citizens because that's not a prevalent identity. 

Integrating into a state is more difficult, because they can be much more homogenous even if Europe as a whole is very diverse.

968,"&gt;if you dont mind me asking, what is it about the Eastern European countries and their highly conservative stances on this issue? 

I tried to write it already like 5 times, each time with like A4 page of text but every time i don't think it quite explained what is going on.

Simply put ""problem"" here is very complex and it is very hard to understand it when you are thought from kid (especially if you are young) how to see world. It requires a lot of context and some ideas that at first glance don't make sense. But let me try to put it in simple therms.

Key to understanding it is Scandinavian paradox.
You should google it because by itself it is very complex ""problem"" but general gist of it is that the notion that if you give women more rights and make them equal they will naturally start to take same jobs as men and generally be like men, choose physics instead of being nurse. That kind of thing.

Scandinavian paradox is name for problem that came out of studies in scandinavia about progress of equalization is society. You see Scandinavian nations gave women more rights than any other nation faster than anyone else, not only they did that but also they gave them incentives and so on to do jobs usually done by men. And this was done from 1900 so about 100 years still going on.

What was the effect ? Complete opposite of what feminists wanted.
Women started to choose MORE women oriented jobs. There are now bigger ratio of nurses vs mele nurses than it was 50 years ago. They work less than 50 years ago and so on. Seriously you should watch documentary on same name on youtube.

So with than context now you have EE. They didn't start as early as Scandinavia but with communism they started earlier than US or generally ""the west"". End product of that is same as in scandinavia, today women choose psychology, medical care etc more than they did 50 years ago.

People in EE had free abortion with rise of communism. They tried it and they didn't like it.

If this is first time you hear of it then i know it might sound crazy to you but it is actual empirical data. This is reality.

It's a whole package of genetics and culture that make one white, as the term is used nowadays. European origin, genetic makeup and values/culture is typically what people refer to as white. I guess there's quite a few variations on that, from Spain to Greece to Russia to America. Though you're right in that South Europeans are typically darker skinned, and many have a skin complexion akin to Arabs. Yet you can tell them apart due to other features; hair, nose, eyes being the typical markers. 

It's at times hard to define where one begins and the other ends, particularly in places that were under control of another empire a long time ago, and the traits got mixed.

1033,"I can understand them, but only those who genuinely wish to sue for peace, not the 60% or so in polls that still pine for 'pushing the Zionist into the sea' and reinstating a Palestinian nation which has never been founded. 

The Israeli-Arab conflict begun with Jews returning to where once stood a Jewish nation, at the behest of Europeans who told them go back where they came from, and under the authority of the ruling empires at the time. Many of the Palestinians themselves are descendants of immigrant waves over history:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jund_Filastin#History_and_structure

&gt;""The Arab tribes that settled Jund Filastin after the Muslim conquest were the Lakhm, Kindah, Qais, Amilah, Judham and the Kinanah; at the time of the Arab conquest, the region had been inhabited mainly by Aramaic-speaking Miaphysite Christian peasants.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah#Ottoman_era

&gt;""Modern Ramallah was founded in the mid-1500s by the Haddadins (also: Haddadeen), a clan of brothers descended from Ghassanid Christians. The Haddadins (ancestors of the present-day Jadallah family, among others), and their leader Rashid El-Haddadin, arrived from east of the Jordan River from the areas of Karak and Shoubak.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nablus#Classical_antiquity

&gt;""Located between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, the new city lay 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) west of the Biblical city of Shechem which was destroyed by the Romans that same year during the First Jewish-Roman War.""

&gt;""Insofar as the hilly topography of the site would allow, the city was built on a Roman grid plan and settled with veterans who fought in the victorious legions and other foreign colonists.""

I could go on. But to the 'natives' of the land, this was an unforgivable transgression and attempt to change the cultural, religious character of Palestine, and so they begun, as soon as the first Jewish communities were established, to violently oppose it. Thus was the ""crime"" attributed to them, while in Nazi Germany children were humiliated and abused in schools with yellow patches and eventual concentration camp, without trial, without any charge other than being 'inherent parasites', with no criminal record or named personal transgression of any sort. Hardly seems comparable to the early Zionists immigrating somewhere to me. Moving on.

Here is a list of [all massacres in mandatory Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_and_massacres_in_Mandatory_Palestine), all the way back to the 20's. Can you take a look at ""Responsible Party"" and tell me who initiated all the first massacres against whom? It was only after those that Irgun, the first Jewish militia targeting civilians was founded with the express charter of ""Avenging the slaughtered Jewish villages and neighborhoods"", which doesn't justify their actions, but is an important clarification in the timeline. Once again, there appears to be no equivalency to the relations of the Nazis and Jews. In fact, it was during this time that the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem allied himself with the Nazis, actively encouraging genocide in mandatory Palestine. **Before a single atrocity against Arabs was committed**.

Moving on - After the civil fighting that waged on for years as a result of these early ethnic pogroms, the partition plan was offered. The Palestinian Nationalists would have a state, of equal size, although not the one they wanted ( and never existed ), and neither would the Zionists. But the Zionists, as we know, accepted. Did the Nazis ever agree to split anything with their victims? I don't think so, moving on.

1948 war of independence, Israel wins after repeated proclamations of their impending destruction arrogantly and smugly coming from Arab League leaders. Nakba ensues, in which a large number of the Palestinians flee the war, sometimes being banished by advancing troops. Atrocities occur on both sides, but nontheless, **The entire death count of every single Israeli-Arab conflict to ever take place**, counting both militants and civilians like, somehow doesn't even come close to the ankles of any other famous ethnic conflict at these times. A sizeable amount of Arab-Palestinian remains and eventually makes up the 2 million ( out of 8 million total ) Israelis with citizenship. Anything similar going on in Nazi German during WW2? I think not.

Cue ensuing conflicts, in which each and every time Arab coalitions vow to completely decimate Israel entirely, but Israel wins ( Which is also how the west bank and gaza become occupied, ironically ). What does Israel do? Sign peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and there's peace with jordan and egypt ever since. Was Nazi Germany going to just sign a peace treaty with Poland after winning? Judging by the plans for the Europa-spanning Reich, I think not.

Cue all the upcoming peace talks and offers submitted by Israel, even if they were imperfect, during the negotiations that took place as soon as Arab countries decided to quit trying to gang up on Israel with wars. Did Hitler ever offer peace treaties to Jews? I think not. An Israeli PM even got assassinated by a some ultra right-winger for making what were seen as far-fetching concessions. Yizhak Rabin.

Cue modern day. The 'land', depending on which land is being talked about ( If you watch interviews with Palestinians, all of Israel is 'their land' and they won't rest until they retrieve it ) has only been ""taken"" ( Occupied/advanced into ) due to a war started on behalf of the Palestinians. Access to jobs, although I'm not sure exactly what you're talking ( Please provide a link, as far as I know there aren't really restricted jobs other than military ones or the Gazan fishing limits/import restrictions ) is restricted because of [all of this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_suicide_attacks#2000s). Is there an equivalent to that in 1930's Germany? I don't think so. As for the families homes, regardless of the fact that it's used as a means of dissuading attackers from engaging in these actions knowing their families will receive payments, it's just a statistically documented fact that the majority of Palestinian families fully support 'Shahids'. If you aren't aware of that, then you haven't done much research on Palestinian society.

All of that aside, there are still 2 million Arabs living in Israel itself, with the majority of which saying in polls, for some mysterious reason, saying [they'd prefer to live under sovereignty](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4239288,00.html) rather than hypothetical PA authority. I don't think that the folk over at Bergen-Belsen were of the same opinion about living in Nazi Germany vs literally anything else. Gaza is already almost completed ruled by Hamas minus the blockade, and the blockade exists because Hamas vowed to fight against Israel in the first place. And the West Bank was taken over because it was used as a staging ground against Israel in the first place. And as for the how it all started and why decades earlier, that's been covered above already.

So no, I can't understand Palestinian feelings toward Israelis in comparison to the victims of Nazi Germans toward their avid enablers. I can understand if they think the current situation is bad for both parties though and wish to earnestly achieve a peace deal, and I can understand if they hate Israelis who irrationally hate them, but is is a matter of historical facts that the majority of Israelis have never interacted with Palestinians even remotely on the same terms, reasoning, capriciousness and sadism that Nazi interacted with Jews, the disabled, Roma, Poles and so forth on.

Here is the kicker- my grandpa only has like 6 grades. His wife worked as a part-time cleaner.   


They lived decently, and he still lives in the same apartment.  


Now let me ask you this, can the average Romanian that didn't even finish high school afford to own a 2 bedroom apartment, raise and provide for 2 kids and retire by 55 ? I know that here in America at least this is a pipe dream that no longer happens. ",,/r/europe/comments/af7evh/today_29_years_ago_romania_banned_the_communist/edy8nu9/,GlitterIsLitter,1547352811

Can this produce misleading numbers? 

Yes, absolutely. Apparently the French are hardened criminals that are 377% more criminal than hard-working Italians.

OR the statistic also counts French people that were on vacation and are subsequently locked up. 

Why is this bad? If you have 4 million french tourist for example, but only 1 million legal French residents, it makes it seem like the residents are committing the crimes of the tourists. Same goes for migrants trying to move *through* Italy vs. legal residents.

Secondly if it counts an illegal border crossing as a crime in itself that you are locked up for, then that doesn't tell you anything about how dangerous/criminal people from those countries are.

If you walk across an unsecured border or overstay a visa, that doesn't mean you're gonna stab someone.

I think coming from an American standpoint there is a tendency to see something small or of similar size, criteria and governance to a US State as essentially not a country like a US state is but Scotland was a entirely separate entity until 1707 when it entered into a union - it has its own Scottish Government, legally defined border and territories and a relatively big population compared to many European countries and European nation states that you probably recognise as countries ",DNA % are 54üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø19üá©üá™11üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø7üá≥üá¥6üá∏üáÆ3üá´üá∑,/r/europe/comments/afbmy0/new_raf_jet_combat_ready_in_face_of_resurgent/edy0ok9/,Jiao_Dai,1547346290

He was. That's how it works in democracies (which Germany was, before Hitler dismantled it). They got the majority in the parliament, because 37/33% of the vote is quite substantial, and in fact, they were by far the most popular party in the country.

And also, that's ""just"" 35% before any of Hitler's public works or propaganda took place. That's ""just"" 35% in 1932, not 1940.

You couldn't have picked a worst example. That practice almost died under Taliban rule. The punishment was literally death sentence, I dunno how that is a norm when people literally kill you for it.

Lets see what happened when US invaded:
https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/world/asia/us-soldiers-told-to-ignore-afghan-allies-abuse-of-boys.html

Oh yes, they actually ignored the practice because they didn't upset their ""friendly"" warlords. Not only that, some of the foreign contractors actually hired kids to ""entertain"" themselves.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/02/foreign-contractors-hired-dancing-boys 

See people, this is what happens when you only read headlines from r/worldnews and form an opinion without knowing anything about the subject. 

Literally google anything regarding the issue and it will tell you that practice was literally non-existent under Taliban rule but popped up again after invasion. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacha_bazi

&gt;bacha bazi apparently carried the death penalty under Taliban law.[11][12] The practice of dancing boys is illegal under Afghan law, being against Islam,[13]

Up to that Hungary gives rather large subsities for housing when it comes to kid, in case of three kid family in nuclear family, sufficient to build a medium size house at countryside. Again, looking at the fact that European youth are leaving the parent house older and older, this could help there as well.

Furthermore, electricity is just a part of energy supply, and we'll need something like fossil fuel for industrial processes and home heating for the time being. So then I prefer gas for those rather than other fossil fuels.

Maybe so but neither of you _cares_ about achieving equality; either only cares about their own self-interest so claiming that you do so out of an interest in equality rather than self-interest is still a lie.

&gt; I do care about equality, and I want everyone to have rights, not just myself. I just concern myself more with discrimination against myself

&gt; If I wasn't subject to discrimination in any way I probably would be concerned with other people's rights; in fact when I was a very young man and still believed the lie that white men aren't discriminated against, I was concerned with these issues.

My point of criticism is that people in r/europe by and large seem to be active-negative.

- reintroduction of the death penalty (aiming at former high ranking communists, under investigation at the time)

Capitalism is a very shitty tool for that, because while going against democracy and state power, you just create a separate power system where instead of votes, money decides what happens. Instead of using the political power to control people, economic power is being used to do the very same thing.

1712,"&gt; Marxist Leninism combined the philosophy taught by Marx with the practical realities of Russia by Lenin. It was meant to be a transitional strategy so they can create a truely communist society free of class and money. The industries were to be owned by the state until it was possible to give them back to the workers.

To some extent. However, it was developed a bit before the Russian revolution. 

&gt; It also ignores a lot of context surrounding Russia. 

Development of the ideology is one thing, but it was applied consistently throughout the world, from Germany to Cuba. At that point the context of its development doesn't matter as much.

&gt; If you look closely, this probably makes a strong divide between supporters of Democratic Socialism and Marxist Leninism, where Democratic Socialism is more popular in developed countries, and Marxist Leninists are more popular in developing countries.

Not really. Russia for instance held elections in 1917 where people voted for the parties they wanted in charge. The Democratic Socialists won the most seats, securing double the seats the Bolsheviks did. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1917_Russian_Constituent_Assembly_election

After the Bolsheviks, the Ukrainian branch of the Democratic Socialist party got the next biggest proportion of the votes. I think it's clear that the Bolsheviks never really were that popular. One group they were popular with however was the military. Marxist Leninists don't really tend to be popular, few of the Communist regimes ever really were. They tend to build a base of support, then muscle their way into everything else. Most people are indifferent to them.

The gap between competent and incompetent people is widening all over the world. In East Asia, the countries as a whole are becoming more competitive. In the West, on the other hand, states are increasingly dividing themselves into competence fortresses and immigration countries - with lasting consequences.

Those who are clever don't sound that out, and others count on human tact anyway. Competence researchers, on the other hand, test the entire human race without pity and find three rooms with startling differences in performance. The best students live - first room - with the 1.75 billion inhabitants of East Asia (Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Vietnamese). The second space is the European world with 1.15 billion people in North America, Europe, Russia, Israel and Oceania. With 1.5 and 1.6 children per woman's life respectively, both blocks are struggling with shrinkage and ageing. The remaining 4.7 billion - the third and largest area - have 2.5 to 6 children per woman's life, but the worst pupils and only 1.7 percent of globally recognized inventions (according to the ""Patent Cooperation Treaty""). With a steady shift towards East Asia, the first two rooms of this mother of all resources are still the same.

Beyond their demographic pressure, the 4.7 billion people who are beaten are also in motion because they are not just lying behind, but continue to slip. India (1.35 billion), for example, is currently falling 1-to-5 behind China in 1980 from a 1-to-1 parity in per capita income. Brazil (210 million) is falling from 4 to 1 to 1 to 1, while oil-rich Iran (82 million) is tilting from an 8-to-1 triumph into a 1-to-2 defeat.

When all of a sudden a very strong one, China, enters the global race and casually competes away what is there in respectable, but nevertheless second-rate industries, once promising tigers can no longer even sell bed rugs. Soon, two-thirds of humanity will stay down where there is a lack of expertise for the development of high-tech industries without which there would be no access to world markets beyond raw materials.
New orientations

The fact that 550 million people from sub-Saharan Africa alone want to emigrate at present and almost 1.1 billion in 2050 - with unchanged wishes - cannot come as a surprise with such prospects. It is the historically unprecedented mega-dimension of this crowding that creates completely new orientations in the European region. With their hands raised and without weapons, those willing to migrate reach the borders. It is precisely their helplessness, which is so remote from education, that worries us, because in modern states they grant the right to lifelong social assistance. The Coming Comers have the UN on their side. Their ""Global Compact for Migration"" wants ""a safe, orderly and regulated migration"" and ""to be able to intervene at any time against xenophobia, racism and discrimination"" by international courts.

The most spectacular movement against unqualified immigration wants to close national borders and bears the label populism. Where it fails, attempts are made to contain economically still strong subregions and at least to keep them culturally free and successful on the markets. They are fought as separatism. The most inconspicuous, but at the same time most momentous, is the departure of innovators who, by paying for the new arrivals, lose courage and flee to competence fortresses, who bind their own talents, recruit foreign talents and repel educational distance. These mostly Anglo-Saxon refugee castles arm them against competition from the Far East.

Under 1000 ten-year-old East Asians, 320 to over 500 belong in the highest mathematical performance class. In Turkey, Sweden and Germany there are about 50, in France 25. On the continent alone Switzerland - interpolated from its 2015 Pisa results - comes closest to the East Asians with about 220 experts under 1000 children. This is why the small country will be able to take the lead over Nippon in 2017 in terms of PCT patents per million citizens, while Germany only manages 60 percent of the Japanese.
On the descent

The smartest governments - with Singapore as their global vanguard - are promoting a permanent overqualification of their citizens, so that competence is available for the companies of tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Pisa 2012 shows just how much Germany, for example, is failing in this respect. While 50 percent of the migrant children raised here (soon to be 40 percent of the total young generation) do poorly, insufficiently and even worse in mathematics, ""only"" 30 percent of the old Germans fail. The TIMSS Student Maths Olympiads are going downhill from 12th place in 2007 to 16th and 24th place in 2011 and 2015.

Although the USA is almost three times stronger than Western Europe in terms of top talent, almost 50 percent complain of school failure. Farmers want cheap seasonal workers, but the nation gets people with dignity and the right to family reunion. Under the outlawed term ""chain migration"" this becomes the most important instrument of US immigration policy. Already half of all children are raised in families that have less than 2000 dollars at their disposal for times of need.

In view of Germany's educational fiasco, no one can convince the East Asians that lowering the level will improve their competitiveness. All together, not even 100 asylum seekers are admitted each year. Because they feel that the uneducated tend not to provide a viable replacement for their pensioners, they rely on robots and are world leaders with over 60 percent of the installed art people.

Beyond oil emirates and millionaires' enclaves, Hong Kong (39 percent), Singapore (45 percent) and Macau (59 percent) have the highest proportions of migrants worldwide. In Europe, Switzerland leads (29 percent). All four countries have put blind xenophobia on the political sidelines. But these countries also know how difficult it is to be good at math. Those who bring too little can hardly be brought up to the level of East Asians, even with megabucks for state education. With this unpleasant insight, they are bringing about a strategic rethink in the European bloc. Meanwhile Australia and Canada - after Singapore - have the smartest immigrants.
Progress is happening in China

The former crown colonies with barely 70 million people on almost 18 million square kilometres know that the 70 million hard-working people in the Pearl River delta want to be at the forefront. Berlin's core message to its own offspring √† la ""sacrifice yourselves for pensioners and poor, needy immigrants from Africa and the Islamic Arc"" is not heard from Ottawa or Canberra. On the other hand, you hear loudly and unmistakably: ""We leave you more in your pockets, we prevent terror, we do not tolerate hatred of the Jews. Precisely because they issue passports only to aces, these countries become magnets for efficient immigrants from the rest of the European world.

The fact that, despite the loss of 3 million ambitious seeds to the Anglo world, the 1.4 billion country China - four times the USA, seventeen times Germany and one hundred and seventy times Switzerland - hunts the rest of the world with technical progress is due to the sheer mass of its ambitious people. Even if one estimates - against 350 in Taiwan - only 250 mathematicians per 1000 children, there are 28 million talented among the 130 million from the generation of 25 to 29-year-olds alone in 2015.

Which industry should China not be able to conquer - with an average age of 37 years compared to 38 in the USA, 42 in Switzerland and 47 in Germany? Most cameras, computers, batteries, solar cells and electric buses are already being built there. Even with lower wages, no western country has yet been able to recoup such production. In addition to artificial intelligence, 43 percent of the publications (56 percent of all citations) come from Chinese. The four best Fintech companies work in China. By 2016 there will be fifty times more ""mobile payments"" than in the USA. While Amazon boasts of the announcement of parcel drones, Beijing competitor JD has already made 20,000 such deliveries since November 2016.

Beijing is planning 19 mega-urban regions that will become one-hour business areas thanks to high-speed trains. The 5 most important have an average of 110 million people. These talent pools enable networks and productivity boosts that have never been achieved before.

1880,"Uncomfortable situation

For France and Germany the situation looks less comfortable. Germany is falling from eighth to twentieth place in terms of digital sustainability between 2013 and 2018. Red carpets are waving everywhere to the remaining talents. On the other hand, those supplied by their taxes will remain loyal to the country.

The Scandinavians are bluntly deploring the departure of the British. Berlin is cool to hear that they will not replace London's loss of billions in contributions. If Brussels wants to continue to give the benefactor, the Germans should pay for it on their own. Between Copenhagen and Helsinki they are ready to jump off.

Due to relatively low wages, the Warsaw - Prague - Bratislava - Budapest area is also groaning under the emigration of experts who work harder for the West than flow back to EU structural aid. The Eastern freedom from terror, however, has long since provided a locational advantage that brings back alumni and keeps the now adolescents at home. Pupils perform significantly better than those in Western Europe, and the average age is even lower. If, in exchange for their expatriates, Germany wants to force on them migrants who have little education - in ""solidarity"" burden-sharing - it should come as no surprise that the East is just as resolutely sealing itself off as Denmark from Schleswig-Holstein.

But Berlin, as a financier for Brussels, is not only marginalised by the ostracism of the dynamic EU members. More serious is the fact that - unlike the nuclear powers France and Great Britain - it cannot defend itself militarily and stop the disqualification of its population. In the block with the worst pupils, 1.7 billion from 80 nations are in permanent danger of civil war and are therefore striving north. They hope that Trump will fail to close the border with Mexico and that Berlin will stick to its welcome culture.
The potential for conflict

On 1000 55- to 59-year-old men in this block, who thus free 1000 positions in economy and society, 2500 to 8000 young people between 15 and 19 years enter the hard life. Their war index of 2.5 to 8 is opposed by Germany with 0.66 (660 young people per 1000 old), Austria and Switzerland with 0.8. As soon as violence sets in in in the high index countries, young people who fail as economic refugees suddenly live in war zones. They are then not only weak learners, but have claims to protection or even asylum. Their challenge for Europe can only grow. Although there are only 66 nations left in 2030 with an index above 2.5, they still have 2.2 billion inhabitants due to extreme birth rates.

The ancestral Europeans will then be even older and more worn down by the insecurity in their cities, but individual states will respond to the calls from Australia or Canada with the establishment of their own competence fortresses. For who would have a better answer to the Australian immigration minister Peter Dutton, who trumpeted out: ""Whoever drives such a strict migration programme as we do, will get productive new citizens who will bring the country growing prosperity because they do not depend on the state but work diligently""?

2050,"&gt; Two weeks ago I visited Birmingham while the Conservative Party Conference was being held. All around me were examples of the worst elements of the English ruling class: their solipsism, their hatred of the poor, their amazing rudeness. A man in a boater hat and cravat, drinking Champagne and smoking a cigar, ignored a homeless woman asking for change and then chided me when I gave her some.

The Irish aren't alone. I've family on Scotland (English myself) who all counted themselves opposed to Scottish independence from the UK during [the indyref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Scottish_independence_referendum). They're all pretty mute on the topic now, but agreed with me when I said I couldn't even imagine being Scottish and opposed to independence any more. The smug, self satisfied, delusional hypocrites that infest the UK's political class will soon end the union using the only power and influence they ever really had; the power to remind everyone how much they should hate the English. 

The way the English present themselves to the world today is hideous. Brexit was the catalyst for the biggest arseholes we've produced to see how far they can go with their laughable sense of superiority and English exceptionalism. You can't excuse the nationality of those arseholes that threw the pigeon head, because they're a very English breed of arsehole. And yes, they're on our streets and in our pubs too, being arseholes to any English person with a sense of decency they can imagine themselves superior. And they voted in the UK government currently broadcasting their attitudes to the world. There's a desperation to their self-aggrandisement; like Donald Trump they exhaust whatever superiority they could've had by screaming at people to notice it. 

The English have always been smug and regarded themselves as better than foreigners, but there was a time when it manifested as much through charity and decency as arrogance. If you think you're a better people, behave better and kinder than others. Empire gave us a sense of superiority, and we committed a vast multitude of sins in its name, but occasionally our better sense would demonstrate that we could be a force for good in the world too. But we seem to be losing that culture war; the good in this country have come to terms with the fact we aren't exceptional, leaving only the delusional self-aggrandisers to run the show.

2112,"In China and Japan, Western names were described phonetically by selecting characters that sounded similar; however, because of the great number of homonyms, the choice of character also represented what they associated with these countries. Initially, mostly 3 characters were used, but that was quickly abbreviated to the first character:

For example: 

Ying guo Ëã±ÂõΩ: England where ""ying"" means heroic

Fa guo Ê≥ïÂõΩ: France where ""fa"" means the law

De guo Âæ≥ÂõΩ: Germany where ""de"" means virtue

Mi guo Á±≥ÂõΩ: America where ""mi"" means beautiful

Many countries where given the same names in both China and Japan; however, there are some exceptions. For example:

Germany: De guo Âæ≥ÂõΩ in Chinese and Doku koku Áã¨ÂõΩ in Japanese, where ""de"" is virtuous and ""doku"" is alone or independent.

Today, foreign names are mostly transcribed with the Katakana phonetic script in Japanese, but Chinese characters are still used for some occasions.

Examples of katakana transcriptions:

igirisu: England

furansu: France

doitsu: Germany

‚Ä¢ Greece sought to r**einforce its independence and position within the regional and international system by developing its relations with other international actors beyond the United States of America**. 

‚Ä¢ Accession to the Community was regarded by Greece as a powerful factor that would contribute to the **development and modernization of the Greek economy and society.** 

‚Ä¢ Greece wanted, as a European country, to be present in, and **have an impact on the process of European integratio**n as well as the configuration of the European model. 

The European Community's reaction to the Greek application was initially expressed by the European Commission, which, according to article 237 (at the time) of the Treaty of Rome, had to state its ""opinion"" on the country's application for accession to the Community. T**he Commission published its ""opinion"" on January 28, 1976.

&gt;Read again what I wrote. The AfD said those  things because of an unreliable eye witness who spoke about it first.  They didn't just pull those things out of their asses to lie.

The Kantholz: yes. But:

&gt; auf  heimt√ºckischste Art und Weise von drei maskierten Linksterroristen  √ºberfallen und halbtot geschlagen 

Lie and/or pure speculation to push their agenda of being the super victim of everything. 

&gt; Mit Tritten gegen  den Kopf des am Boden liegenden Opfers. 

Lie.

Lie.

&gt; Versuchten, aber aufgrund des beherzten Eingreifens eines zuf√§llig des   Weges kommenden, mutigen Bauarbeiters Gott sei Dank nicht vollendeten   Mord. 

Lie.

&gt; And I can't believe that we need to discuss this instead of how fucking  evil Antifa is, and how the ""Nazis raus"" rhetoric and branding all AfD  members as Nazis lead to this incident. The other politicians know  exactly that there are people like antifa who justify their violence  against people they themselves call nazis as morally correct. They  willingly bought into this rhetoric. 

Wow. First, there is not the antifa. There are countless independent groups, who call themself antifa. Some are dangerous, some are peaceful. They obviously have to be judged based on their actions and not on ""how fucking  evil Antifa"" propaganda like you.

Second, nobody knows if it was an attack from the left. 

Third, how can one say, that the sentence ""Nazis raus"" is a bad thing? Everybody should have that opininion, being a nazi is not compatible with the constituion.

Fourth, 

&gt;branding all AfD  members as Nazis lead to this incident

This is hardly done. Especially the media does never use this. But if you consider this:

[https://www.das-ist-afd.de/](https://www.das-ist-afd.de/)

Some people in the AfD work hard everyday to get called nazis. Additionally consider the union with right extreme grous in Chemnitz, some member of the parliaments used to be in the NPD and other right extreme groups and have still contacts there. And who in their party says that these things are/were not ok? Nobody.

And this right here is no particular case:

If the trader has not complied with this subparagraph, the consumer shall not be bound by the contract or order.*

The relevant parts of Article 6 (1) are:

* *(e) the total price of the goods or services inclusive of taxes, or where the nature of the goods or services is such that the price cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, the manner in which the price is to be calculated, as well as, where applicable, all additional freight, delivery or postal charges and any other costs or, where those charges cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, the fact that such additional charges may be payable. In the case of a contract of indeterminate duration or a contract containing a subscription, the total price shall include the total costs per billing period. Where such contracts are charged at a fixed rate, the total price shall also mean the total monthly costs. Where the total costs cannot be reasonably calculated in advance, the manner in which the price is to be calculated shall be provided;*

&gt;The Portuguese government and the embassy are running awareness campaigns to get Brits to register before Brexit day on March 29.

&gt;‚ÄúIn case of a no-deal scenario ‚Ä¶ **the guarantee to acquire the right of permanent residence would only apply to UK nationals who are resident in Portugal before 29 March**,‚Äù says a new government pamphlet.

2248,"It's more likely than you make it sound, we see similar stuff actually happening all the time. A pretty big part of Russian propaganda involves just making people accustomed to their culture, which is often nothing more than promoting their completely apolitical movies, and yes, tourist destinations. The point is to lower the resolve of a hypothetical resistance in case of a hypothetical invasion, and that absolutely does work.  
It's a bit of a crapshoot though, usually the only way to see the difference between apolitical media and government propaganda is to look at who's paying for it, and even then it's far from being the most dangerous thing in their infowar arsenal, so while being aware is good, going to paranoia levels is not exactly reasonable. Also, this is a place where the line between fighting Russian propaganda and spreading anti-Russian propaganda is so thin it might not even exist, and that opens a whole lot of additional problems.

Well it's good that Germany is investing in it's military.

&gt;On the other Hand: Hilariously low?Most of our Land based vehicle have a normal operational Equipment. In addition many Systems are quite old or brand new that causes the most Problems and everything flying in general. 

I assume you can read English and you read the articles I linked. Only 95 operational tanks, 0 operational submarines, no operational A400Ms, i.e. no airlift capability, only half frigates are operational, 4 operational Eurofighters.

It is hilariously low. You cannot defend your airspace with only 4 functioning planes. Norwegians have [shown us that in 2017](https://www.aldrimer.no/russian-forces-exercised-attack-on-svalbard/). Russia simulated an attack on Svalbard and Norway had only 8 operational F-16s, they could only intercept the first wave of bombers, Russia obviously has more operational equipment. Hopefully this will be fixed by Norwegian acquisition of F-35s.

In general it seems that only 30-40% of Germany military equipment is operational at any point in time.

&gt;Another Hilarious thing is that the German armed forces get shit, while some other Nations here on the list, used mostly old Germany or Soviet Equipment, which is consider not up to date for a modern conflict. And some it's redditor from those Nation that throws the biggest tantrum here.

Operational old Soviet equipment is better than brand new non-functioning equipment. But even that comparison is bullshit, Leopard 2 is the same age as the T-72, and most countries with T-72s have been upgrading their stock. Germany is the biggest economy in Europe and a country with 80 million people, more is expected from you than from Romania and Poland, but the sad state of affairs is that even if only 80% of Polish equipment is operational, Polish military is more capable than German.

&gt; Maybe you should talk with Member of your armed forces

I do, our land forces are perfectly fine for the size of our country, the only problem there is a small population, which is fixable by reintroducing conscription.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_and_dump

&gt;""Pump and dump"" (P&amp;D) is a form of securities fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Once the operators of the scheme ""dump"" sell their overvalued shares, the price falls and investors lose their money. **This is most common with small cap cryptocurrencies** and very small corporations, i.e. ""microcaps"".[1] See Microcap stock fraud.

It's a correct observation and it is happening rapidly in recent 2-3 years, however, many people in the west misunderstood the new wave of nationalism = pro- current communist regime. In reality, these two ideologies are hostile enemies. Since the ""1980s liberals"" completely faded in history for being ""pro-America traitors"", the most challenging opposition among the youth are the nationalists. The online opinion, although very censored, tend to hate the policies towards Tibetans --- they do not want continuing integration or ""re-education"", think these efforts are waste of time, but prefer ""quick, peaceful"" deportation of all Tibetans out of border. Surprisingly, western MSM still stuck in the old 1980s and 1990s stereotype when talking about ""Chinese opposition"", thinks they still are some kind of naive liberal social democrats.  
  
In my observation, if any kind of revolution happen in China in the next 5-10 years, the westerners would be very shocked when ethno-nationalist forces elected to power and start immediate deportation of all Uighurs and Tibetans.

2515,"If the two issues are:

&gt;Amazon‚Äôs terms enable the company to switch out an ordered product with something else, and the buttons break laws protecting shoppers from buying things they are not fully informed about, according to Reuters.

Then I assume that they can resolve it via having a way to send a phone to the relevant page (e.g. print a QR code on each button) and via Amazon requiring vendors to sign on to an greement that products not be reformulated if they want them to be button-availble to German consumers.

The former seems trivial.

The latter seems like it would take some doing, and maybe there isn't enough scale for most products to make them workable, but I don't see any clear reason why the German consumer law in question is profoundly unreasonable.

I *do* question whether the typical person going to the store in Germany has any real idea that the box of deterget that they're buying has an updated formula, even if they're buying it from the store shelf, though.  That is, while the rationale might be valid, it's not clear to me that the real-world implementation is effective across-the-line.

Finally, it's common for manufacturers to tweak formulas and designs to address bugs or issues in existing products.  It's not like once a product is developed, all the engineers get laid off and it remains static for all time.  In the US, a few years back, I remember when cocoa butter rose in price a few years back, and candy vendors redesigned some candy to use palm oil derivatives.  It was noticeable because it resulted in some candy bars having ""chocolate"" dropped from their name over here.

https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/cocoa-butter-equivalent-future-chocolate

&gt;As long as CBE comprises percent or less of the confection, the EU allows the finished product to still be labeled as ‚Äúchocolate.‚Äù The U.S. does not abide by this ruling, and while permitting CBEs as ingredients, insists that alternative names such as ‚Äúchocolate flavored coating‚Äù be employed instead.

Then you have electronic devices that normally have revisions made.  Open up almost any electronic device or look by its serial number and there's good odds that there's a revision number.  Engineers worked to redesign the thing to reduce mnufacturing costs or whatever.

Normally, the mechanism that deals with companies not subsituting a product that you personally like less is reputation ‚Äî  the company's goose that lays the golden eggs is its brand, and if people decide that they don't like the product, the brand loses its value.  So I think that there are probably existing mechanistms that address this.  The consumer protection law in question is not one that I'd personally want to adopt.

Environmentally friendly? Again concerning greenhouse gas emissions alone nuclear energy does fare better than fossil fuels but those should not be our standard to measure how ""environmentally friendly"" something is. Coal, oil and gas are absolutely devastating the delicate balance of our climate and destroying our planet so future generations wont have anything to live on.

Additionally the waste produced by these plants can neither be called clean nor environmentally friendly. There is not one site in the world which will be able to contain the waste for the required amount of time without spilling into nearby water reservoirs and contaminating ecosystems. This is already happening all around the world. Nuclear is fucking up the planet just like coal, oil and gas just on a much more long-term scale.

2. Latin stops pronouncing the H.
3. The word is introduced into Old French as *erbe*.

Also most statistics only use Man on Woman rape, and rape outside of mariage.

2755,"From another comment that BYTFO:

Cool link. Did you read it?

1. Sex without consent is rape in Sweden. Violence or force isn't needed for it to constitute rape.   

2. In Sweden, one offence is counted for each occasion.  If a woman says she has been raped by her husband every day during a  month, the Swedish police may record more than 30 cases of rape.   

3. Studies show that  increased gender equality leads to higher levels of disclosure about violence against women  Sweden, being one of the most gender equal countries in world, one can assume that this is a factor.  

4. At the height of the migration crisis, Sweden took in around 160.000 people. Over the past five years, 427 people born outside of Europe were convicted rapists. 197 of those were from the Middle East/North Africa.

In conclusion - yes, rape is fucking disgusting and a huge problem. Swedish law feels the same way, and we change our laws accordingly. But we absolutely need higher conviction rates and more women (and men) feeling comfortable enough in our society to speak up about sexual violence. 

But spreading misleading high percentages and statistics isn't helping anyone. Read the linked wikipedia-article for more information.

2810,"&gt; Pulling more plant life into urban centres can only have a positive effect on pollution.

I call BS. There are plenty of negatives that plantlife can bring - more dust, more bugs, plants tend to break concrete and buildings, in autumn they create a ton of garbage etc. Some plants smell. They become hazards around roads. They can block sunlight from getting into your windows etc.

&gt;And massive deforestation is exasurbating the climate situation, more plant life will help a bit and we need all the help we can get.

Yeah, no. Urban plant life would make no significant difference, especially considering how ridiculously expensive this is.

&gt;Plus, yknow, it will look nicer.

Yeah, until it's autumn and roads are completely filled with leaves everywhere. They need to be removed from the roads cars drive on, because they can be a hazard, but this costs a lot of money.

As far as my limited knowledge serves, there was no debate whether Austrians are Germans until Austro-Prussian war in 19th century. Up to that point Austrians were as much a part of Germans as Bavarians, Prussians, and other groups were. In fact Austrians often dominated German culture and politics right? and even after the war Austria was excluded in political sense, not in cultural identity sense. You couldn't evict a group of people from a cultural group via a treaty. 

So why is it so wrong to say that Austrians are Germans? Genuinely curious. My guess is that the meaning of the term ""german"" is shifting from the old definition to a new definition that is more/less ""people associated with the modern state of Germany"", but I feel like the old definition is still strong.

3147,"Sweden has elevated rape statistics not because it has more rape, but due to the way they make their statistics:

1. Sweden worked on having an exceptionally high report rate for rape, which is a good thing - fewer rapes go undetected and unpunished. 

2. Sweden decided to always track each seperate incident of rape as a unique case, whereas virtually all other countries ""bundle"" them. Say, one person rapes another person 20 times - in most countries that would be tracked as a single case, whereas Sweden tracks it as 20 cases.  This obviously bloats the statistics - or rather, everyone else embellishes theirs.

3. The Swedish law is set up in a way that includes many lesser sexual offenses in the rape law. So certain acts that would be considered for example sexual harassment in other countries would be called rape by Swedish law, although the scope of punishment is the same (i.e. the Swedish ""rape"" law is a lot more flexible). Yet another factor that caused the statistics to look much worse than reality.

Overall Sweden is actually a very save country. However changes in laws and report  rate made it look like they had an increase in rape when they didn't. Right-wing agitators used these circumstances to twist the facts and claim that Sweden now had a rape problem due to refugees.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/aeuccg/this_is_accurate/edt1vx8/,Roflkopt3r,1547215954

3265,"I can give a brief discussion of an issue in the UK which touches on this.

For our may day (may 1st) celebrations, a traditional part of it was to paint your face black for the festivities to protect against evil spirits or whatever, but this wasn't really too similar to blackface as in trying to look like a black person. You may, for example, only do the very front of your face leaving visible unpainted parts on the sides. 

Now the issue with blackface in the UK (as in trying to look like a black person) comes from the same route as the US, I.e. parodies of black people that were highly stereotyped and performed by white people, which made the act of blackface become entwined with racist connotation. 

If we fast forward to today, there is some issue about the use of black face paint in may day celebrations. To be clear, people defending it typically would not defend blackface. The argument is that it is in no way attempting to impersonate black people and should be viewed completely independently as having a different cultural origin. Those against will argue, independently of the origin, it has the same end product as blackface and is therefore equivalent. It's similar to the argument about people using swastikas in other contexts, yes the Nazis appropriated it, but other cultures have had other meanings for it far earlier than the 1930s. Does this mean Hindus should forsake the swastika too. At least today, the compromise tends to be that people paint their faces completely, perhaps only doing a black t-shape across their forehead and down to their chin. (Some completely forsake it for other colours or patterns, others keep the full look, though). This distances itself from blackface while keeping the tradition. 

And things are made all the murkier that the exact origin of using black face paint in may day celebrations isn't really known. There are a few theories about, some say it started off in a much earlier version of minstrel shows, others say from pagan traditions. Some say it was popularised because of the modern minstrel shows, from which we have the modern issue with blackface. The argument that it has a distinct origin means it should have a distinct interpretation gets very muddled here, as the origin may or may not be all that great. 

I'm not really trying to make any point here  by the way, just trying to give a (hopefully unbiased) overview of a similar tradition.",,/r/europe/comments/aeuccg/this_is_accurate/edsso0g/,jam11249,1547208953

Several Eastern European countries have 1.3 children born per woman, which is way, way, way below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman. AND these countries have net emigration of young people on top of that. This is a recipe for disaster. These countries are aging rapidly.

The death rates are not increasing. Life expectancy is increasing if anything which makes the demographics  worse.

I don't give a damn what your pension policy is, if you don't have enough young workers to pay for  pensions then your pension system will collapse.

Someone becoming a part of your family doesn't influence your life? I don't know how things work in Latvia, but our family members interact with each other regularly.

3652,"Kill all whites, in my opinion, should be legal, it is not specifically inciting violence. If you say, I want all the whites near me to be killed, that is a direct call to violence towards a specific group. The Supreme Court in the US(as an example since it's my frame of reference as an American) has held  ""threats may not be punished if a reasonable person would understand them as obvious hyperbole"". Saying ""Kill all whites"" is generally going to be hyperbole. The basic argument is they do not constitute ""fighting words"". Simple ""incitments to violence"" are allowed since those are considered legitimate political stances/hyperbole. It is only when one acts on such stances that those words can be used as evidence against them. But the very act of saying them is not illegal. If you threaten violence against smaller, targeted groups in a reasonable timeframe that is an exception to the 1st amendment because it constitutes a clear and present danger to those persons. It's a bit nuanced but I agree with it overall. I don't think a broad statement like ""Kill all whites"" should be illegal. Is it political hyperbole to say ""I want to kill all KKK members?"" I don't know, but it is an interesting thought experiment. I think if we start prosecuting or fining people for their words unless they are quite obviously threatening, immediately, we reach into dangerous territory. 

That said, I understand and respect your opinion. I can see why you would be against allowing those statements. But I think banning speech beyond what is absolutely necessary is very harmful to a democracy.

3653,"Well, it better be an argument or you‚Äôre not going to sway me. Why the defensiveness? I never said you‚Äôre stupid, I simply said I disagree with the fact that not liking blm makes you automatically racist. You‚Äôre correct that groups often get painted with negativity when certain fringe members commit violence. I still don‚Äôt see it as racism though. I find it unfortunate that you paint such a broad brush of people who happen to disagree with you. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt agree with my group so of course they‚Äôre racist.‚Äù Surely there‚Äôs more nuance to the situation than that.

Personally, I find BLM‚Äôs message to be a cop out, blaming society as a whole for issues in the black community which I believe can only be changed from within. I see BLM as actually hurting the black community by shifting the blame on society and white people. You might disagree. I‚Äôm open to disagreement, I think it helps us grow and challenge our ideas. Regardless, I have every intention of improving black communities. You see that help in the form of BLM, I see it as an increase in education funding to assist graduation rates and college admission, and ending the war on drugs.

I'd stay in different places. I'd highly recommend Florence, Rome of course and Naples/Pompeii. You'd want at least 3/4 days in Florence, 5 in Rome and 2 to visit Naples and Pompeii, but longer in each place ideally and add time to travel between the cities.

You may be able to fit in Venice too or some time chilling at a beach. You can easily travel around Italy by train and it isn't too expensive. You can generally find accomation for most budgets too.

3701,"&gt;Yes but that's my point. An opt-out by its very definition is completely the anthesis of the very inclusiveness intent of the EU. 

And yet lots of countries have them. The alternative to allowing opt outs is to hold the block at the speed of the 'slowest' member. Now I don't necessarily disagree with that as an approach, but in the past it'd have killed things like Schengen and the Euro pretty much dead.

&gt;If Britain can't stay in and negotiate to amend the regulations it doesn't like through mutual compromises, then why even stay be part of it?

I agree with you. I think the EU is a bad fit for the UK and the UK would be better of out of the EU rather than in it. Indeed I think one of the problems the EU would have if the UK were to remain (as unlikely as that is) is that any future integration by the EU would ace fairly major public opposition in the UK (from leave voters and current remainers..) and future governments would find it far more difficult to just wave it through.

All in, at this point it is better for the EU, and the UK for he UK to be out of the EU.

3723,"&gt;You've made the association with the death penalty and you stand by it.

I used gay marriage and ending the death penalty as examples of things that both the government, and the opposition are in favour of.. You know, like leaving the EU. I'm not sure why that's hard to understand, or what 'association' you think that implies. Again, I don't know about you, but as a leave voter, I'm pleased that the UK doesn't have the death penalty, and that it does have gay marriage, but I don't think that's related to my vote on EU membership..

&gt;You could edit or remove your comment but you're defending it. 

Yes. Because my point is very clear, and it is right. I don't think that the opposition should oppose UK government positions for the sake of it (so I don't think they should take a different position on the death penalty, or on gay marriage..), but rather oppose the government when it is wrong, scrutinise it at all times, and support it when it is right. How hard is that to understand?

&gt;The leave campaign really is about the elite eroding human rights.

No, its not. And if that's why you think people voted leave, then it's clear you've missed most of the argument. Hell, if that's why you think people voted leave you must be really confused as to why so many people voted that way!

&gt;We'll just leave all this for the internet to see though, you're passionate to the point of triggered.

Good idea! Although I'd suggest you read back up, because I think you've either fundamentally misunderstood what you are replying to..

Your reaction now is precisely what I intended to hammer in. You're shocked that anyone could suggest such militarily microscopic countries into that role even if they are rich; the US and Russia would look on Germany demanding to be on the table in such a way. To give you a rough idea of scaling with active military personnel for what the human resources available are, you may have Singapore at 71,600, Germany at 180,997, while the US is at 1,315,297. Russia and China are at respectively around one million and two million. Actually, looking this up is rather funny- Singapore has more amphibious warfare ships, submarines and corvettes than Germany does, and where Germany leads in equipment it is often not as much by you'd think/hope given that Germany is not a city state and has over fifteen times the population.

UK and France of course have not very great military power anymore but they still have capacities exceeding Germany substantially and again, they are already baked into the system. It's difficult to tear that arrangement apart and still keep it ticking; it is however supremely easy to just not change it, and there's no compelling reason to do so just for the sake of a meager addition of Germany or Japan.

Many share that opinion. Until they come up with something better that can politically pass though, we're stuck with what we've got.

3761,"&gt;You and your word association.

Again, an example about things that the opposition shouldn't oppose, is an example, not some sort of game of word association. I think this one is entirely in your head..

&gt;There has been opposition to human rights laws in the UK continuously whilst the EU is a bastion for it. 

See, that's the problem with people not really understanding the issues that they argue about. The UK historically and currently has an excellent human rights record, most of the EU's human rights positions are things that the UK pushed. Now you are right that it's absurd that some people in the UK see the EU as some how 'imposing human rights' on the UK, but then they are a tiny minority. The UK outside of the EU will have more than adequate human rights protections, so I wouldn't worry too much about that.

&gt;Leave is showing what the country really wants which is less human rights. 

No, leave is showing that what the country really wants is not to be in the EU.

&gt;. Its the founding principle of the EU, and there's been a lot of hard work done on it. Human rights just aren't compatible with British sensibilities.
 
Except of course that the UK had a major role in shaping them, but again, you'd need to have an understanding of the issues to know that.  It's worth reading up on though, especially if you are worried about human rights in the UK once it has left the EU. 

Take a moment to look at things like the history of the European Convention on Human Rights (not an EU thing by the way, a European Council thing, but don't let that confuse you) and you'll get an idea of where the influences came from.

3782,"Aw chap, now you are just trying to be being mean, and that isn't really working for you.

If you'd like me to explain the point again I'd be happy to though, it's quite an important one after all it goes like this (I'm simplifying, but feel free to ask questions!):

The UK has a Government who is supposed to govern (The Tory party, headed by Theresa May at the moment and an official opposition (the Labour party, headed by Jeremy Corbyn). 

The government generally has the ability to make new laws by getting them through parliament, it is up to the opposition to scrutinise those laws.

Sometimes, the opposition might not like the laws the government is trying to make, and so will *oppose* them, in that scenario they need to get a majority (most of the MP's in Parliament) to stand with them to oppose the law. 

Sometimes however, the opposition might like a law the government is trying to make, so it will support the law, but still *scrutinise* the legislation. Making sure that it does what the government says it will do, and works property for example. In that scenario they might even support a government bill!

Now when it comes to leaving the EU, both the Government and the Opposition support leaving, they have different ideas as to how that should happen, and the opposition, rather than opposing the governments aims is acting to scrutinise and shape the way that the government takes the UK out of the EU.

3823,"&gt; Controlled would imply that we have the situation in control, yet the people coming here are not independent from welfare, or government support even after large period of time has gone by

But that's not what the above poster talked about. ""Uncontrolled immigration"" is not about whether immigrants need subsidies, but about whether the state has the means to decide and enforce whether they enter or not. This has been the case since 2016 with the Turkey pact, the closing of the Balkan route and increasingly anti-immigration governments. Ergo there is no uncontrolled 3rd world immigration now. 

Sure you can talk about the value of high- vs. low-qualified immigrants. But that's not what I was talking about in response to the above posters' asinine claim that migrants would triple or quadruple and enter Europe uncontrolled.  

Regarding the Muslim numbers, I have used these myself in the past to argue against people saying ""Europe will be 50% Muslim in a few decades hurr durr"". Germany currently has 6% Muslims, and they are a bit younger and their fertility rate is still a bit higher so they'd be at 9% without immigration, 11% at medium immigration. It's not like all Muslims are unemployed or a drain to the economy. Surely it might pose some policy problems for us, but Germany won't find its demise at the hands of 9 or 11% Muslims. 

&gt; 2nd gen and onwards are not counted in those numbers I take. And the fertility rate is dropping, that much is true when we're going onwards from 2nd generation, but not enough, some cases have 5 children and then it drops down to 4, so the number of people are doubling per generation in these cases even after 2nd generation.

Dude. I used the 5+ children as an absurd overexaggeration. There are [13 countries](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/total-fertility-rate/) out of 193 with a birth rate 5+ right now, and none of them are major sources of immigration for Europe in the last few years. That's like literal Chad and Niger where children are needed for farm labor. You're taking my argument how ridiculous immigrants' reproduction would have to be to triple or quadruple (like the above poster claimed) and use these as actual numbers. Most countries current 3rd world immigrants are coming from are at 2-4. About 130 countries on Earth are below 3, and as child mortality in developing countries is a bit higher, the replacement rate also is.  

You also nicely cut off my sentence where I said ""to almost native population levels"". So no, it's not from 5 to 4. More like from 3 to 2.

You're addressing your questions to the wrong person. It's not like I ever spoke out for 3rd world immigration. All I'm saying is we're neither having uncontrolled 3rd world immigration, nor facing a desaster because of birthrates.

----------

The birth rate declines in Iran and Bangladesh were both the result of population control programs by their governments. See [here](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/13/world/bangladesh-still-poor-cuts-birth-rate-sharply.html), [here](https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/how-bangladesh-reduced-average-number-children-woman-mere-21), [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning_in_Iran#Rafsanjani_era_and_decreasing_natality) or [here](https://www.prb.org/menafertilitydecline/). This has nothing to do with ""overpopulation"" (overpopulation in the biological sense would definitely lead to suffering and make headlines) or hostiliy of the rest of the world, but with public policy. I wouldn't have made the point if the reproductive rate declined due to war etc.  
We may face immigration challenges, but it's not like we need to use extreme measures against immigrants. We won't become flooded, and how big of a problem it's going to be will depend on how well developing countries do. You may want to watch [this kurzgesagt video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348) on overpopulation.

So not only they have a minimum majority in the pairlament, which should discourage from such a huge step as independence is, they don't even have half of the support of the voters, and if you count all the people who can vote, wether they voted or not, they have the support of about 25% of the population, that's way to low to achive indepndence, it could be argued that some independentists didn't vote the same that non-independentists, so people who didn't vote shouldn't count, but in my opinion independentists are more likely to vote because they're more invested into politics than non-independentists.

Secondly, they attempt to manipulate people into thinking that the money the state takes from them is tainted, it's dirty money. The state has no moral right to take it away from them.

3985,"&gt;Which European country is currently facing uncontrolled 3rd world immigration? The Balkan route is closed, Italy has a government focused on securing borders, Erdogan keeps many refugees from entering Greece. 2015/16 was one big wave, most of them went to Germany. Ever since 3rd world immigration has gone down a lot. And now with so many anti-immigration governments in place it's surely not going to rise again anytime soon.

Controlled would imply that we have the situation in *control*, yet the people coming here are not independent from welfare, or government support even after large period of time has gone by

Not to mention, if you look at immigration for 50 years, it indeed is at *insane* levels for lack of better word, and it's all cumulative. Trend is clearly showing how we're taking increasing number of people that are demerit to us, and our society at increasing number, even if we ignore frequently appearing spikes in number of arrivals.

&gt;Even if the percentage of foreigners triples or quadruples, Poland, Czechia, Hungary etc. are only going to have like 5-8% third world foreigners. Germany, France, UK, Italy have populations so large that in order for the foreigner population to triple or quadruple in our lifetime their reproductive rates would have to be MASSIVE, like 5+ children per woman. According to all our experience with migrants, this is not happening. From the second generation 

2nd gen and onwards are not counted in those numbers I take. And the fertility rate is dropping, that much is true when we're going onwards from 2nd generation, but not enough, some cases have 5 children and then it drops down to 4, so the number of people are doubling per generation in these cases even after 2nd generation.

But why should we take a number of people that are demerit to us, especially so when it's all cumulative? Not to mention your prospect is very low balling the estimate, Germany with zero immigration estimates is going to have 9% Muslim population by 2050, and remind you that's zero immigration estimate.

If the attempt to make these people self reliant and independent from welfare thorough all of Europe past 50 years, why should the future look any better considering fewer resources and exponentially larger number of people you're attempting to make something out of. 

&gt;And reproductive rates are dropping all over the world. Iran went from 5-7 to &lt;2 children within 20 years, Bangladesh within 10 years.

Bangladesh has 1,115.62 people per sq km, Finland has population density of 17 per sq km. Maybe they just exhausted all their natural resources and overpopulated to the point where it's simply no longer possible to have large families?

[Iran has experienced almost linear increase in population for past 70 years](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=IR), and up to 90s Iran had fertility rate of 7 children per woman, where it dropped dramatically about the same time Soviet Union collapsed.

4123,"&gt; Cologne police came under criticism for their handling of the situation, as their initial press release described the New Year's Eve celebrations as ""playful"". 

They changed there tune as soon as social media began to get the subject trending.

&gt;The second article is behind a paywall. 

Sure your not confusing the independent with washington post it's a free website Washington post is behind a soft paywall just click I agree.

&gt;The first article just describes the fact that police does not reveal the nationalities of the suspects

That's hardly all it describes

&gt;A new, leaked police document which was published by Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and broadcasters NDR and WDR indicates that previous estimates of both the involved perpetrators and victims were far too low.
&gt;&gt;What is surprising is that the full scale of the assaults has only become clear more than six months later, and only because a police report was prematurely leaked by three media outlets.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The delay in communicating the extent of the New Year's Eve crimes is most likely due to a balancing act between the determination of the Cologne police force to not fuel tensions against refugees 

You only have to look at the press releases just after new year to see that they didn't want ro reveal what had happened so they could dodge scrutiny. It's hardly a controversial take that police or more specifically upper management of police forces try to manage there public image by omitting certain truths or burying there heads in the sand just look at Rochdale and those grooming gangs police didn't want to act out of fear of seeming racist.

 The higher up the police management you go the more political the jobs becomes it's the same across the western world there's a reason they have spin doctors and press officers. It isn't to inform the public the truth it's to present their version of the truth.

https://mobile.twitter.com/polizei_nrw_k/status/682875312095539200

The delay in the media reporting on NYE is to blame on the media itself based on the information we have.

Which was made worse by police spin on the situation. 

I'm not saying german or any countries police are some left wing nutjobs scared of the truth it is usually the opposite for the average  police officer but the higher up the totem pole the more political it becomes and the political climate regarding refugees at the time made it politically sensible to obfuscate the truth just like the political situation in rochadale dale at the time.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/ae6odi/new_details_regarding_attack_on_german_afd/edqa8mx/,MulanMcNugget,1547144064

It's a sad thing that fines do hurt the poor more - but given the moderate money generated by fines, I tend to believe that the goal of this system comes from a right place ; as a deterrent for dangerous or anti-social behavior on the road.

Which is precisely what makes the quota based spreading system pointless, and why Orb√°n and Hungary opposes it. It would be an endless back and forth, that costs a lot and is no good for any country or the refugees themselves. 

The problem on top of it if there is an estabilished mandatory spreading system, that reads as a guaranteed way in. The gates were always and still are open for refugees, problem is we are not speaking of refugees 99.9% of the cases, because they would be, identifying them as a refugee should be their top priority. However the 400k people who marched through Hungary made it their priority to avoid identification, because it eould reveal they are not refugees, but economical immigrants who were not threatened and forced to leave. The open borders everywhere + spreading incoming people across all countries is essentially a worldwide invitation. 

That is what Orb√°n opposes, while very much letting in real refugees.

That said, the refugee right goes as far as the refugee reaches the first safe country. If one leaves that, one is no longer a refugee. To reach Hungary, one has to come across several safe countries, regardless syrian real refugees who come to Hungary, will get shelter.

You shouldn't overspeed, whether you can afford it or not. That's the problem with the current system. It becomes a question of ""Can I afford it?"", while it should be a matter of simply not breaking the rules and endangering other people.

&gt;Nope not everyone should go to college as many people can succeed as much without having to go through that. But it does HELP to have higher education degrees. I don't know why it's a bad thing to wish people to succeed, I wish to people with financial issues to earn more yes.

There's a lot of people who can't go through college or university, just because they don't have an academic talent. And that's probably a good thing. Could you imagine if every person in the next generations all thought ""I'm going to college/university and get an academic degree"" and actually succeeded? The jobs market would be insanely imbalanced. In a France where that actually happened, every degree would be joked about the way a Liberal Arts degree is joked about now. :P

You simply need people with more practical than academic talents as well to keep a society running.

4173," A significant aspect of the globalisation of Spain‚Äôs values and policies in the last 20 years is clearly the importance given to development assistance policies. **Thirty years ago Spain was a recipient of official development assistance (ODA). Today Spain is a donor country and its contributions have tripled in the last 20 years**. Consequently, the percentage of GDP allocated to ODA increased to 0.25% in 2004 and 0.31% in 2005 (EUR 2,600 million), and according to the PACI (Annual Plan for International Cooperation), it is expected to reach 0.35% in 2006. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, Spain‚Äôs development assistance efforts are on a par with the average of the member countries of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC). Its efforts are therefore far from complete: Spain is still some way from fulfilling the commitments made to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals to eradicate poverty in all its forms. As the graph shows, this problem is not specific to Spain. It affects all the OECD members, which, between the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall (1989) and the Millennium Declaration (2000), reduced their relative average development assistance efforts considerably.

4193," Political culture Democratisation and European integration have always been closely linked in Spain. Historically, Europeanisation was always seen as something that would finally enable Spain to consolidate its democratic institutions and overcome a past marked by divisions, internal conflicts and authoritarianism. Looking back, it is evident that these hopes were well-founded given that the democratic period that began with the 1978 Constitution is the longest in Spain‚Äôs history. **Nevertheless, when Spain applied to join the (then) European Community in 1977, our partners in the Community wondered if a country like Spain, with a limited democratic tradition, would be capable of developing and consolidating stable democratic institutions.** Nevertheless, the data from the Centre for Sociological Research (CIS) demonstrates that in the last 20 years democracy has been overwhelmingly established as the only feasible option for Spanish society. 

&amp;#x200B;

The solidity of the political culture and democratic preferences of the people of Spain is today unquestionable. Proof of this came in 1994-1995 when the political crisis marked by the end of the cycle of Socialist Party Governments (1982-1996) saw the indicators of satisfaction with the functioning of democracy fall below 40%; however, the preference for democracy as the form of government remained unchanged and maintained particularly strong support (around 80%). T**he Spanish people‚Äôs support for the democratic system has been consolidated by Spain‚Äôs membership of the EU: in 1984 it was the preferred option of 69% of Spaniards, but this figure had risen to more than 84% by 2004**.

4213,"&gt; they are independent countries that have their own succession laws.

You are right that they're unique roles. The British PM cannot advise that the Queen do anything on behalf of Canada (and vice versa). This has come up in recent years. Such as when the British PM advised that [Conrad Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Black) become a Lord, and the Canadian PM advised her not to do so. Conflicting instructions left the Queen in an awkward position until Black renounced his Canadian citizenship.

To your point about succession though, we actually don't have our own succession laws. As least, when we amended the succession laws to remove male preference, the Government of Canada didn't pass its own amendments. It merely passed a bill recognizing the UK's changes (unlike the other Commonwealth Realms). Their [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_to_the_Throne_Act,_2013#Constitutional_issues) was:

&gt; The laws governing succession are UK law and are not part of Canada's constitution. The 'office of The Queen' includes the Sovereign's constitutional status, powers and rights in Canada. Neither the ban on the marriages of heirs to Roman Catholics, nor the common law governing male preference primogeniture, can properly be said to be royal powers or prerogatives in Canada. As the line of succession is therefore determined by UK law and not by the sovereign, the Queen's powers and rights have not been altered by the changes to the laws governing succession in Canada.

This position was (unsurprisingly) challenged by two Qu√©bec professors. Who argued as you do, that the position is completely separate and Canada should have its own succession laws. A Superior Court Justice (for Qu√©bec) found against their case, saying:

&gt; ""[Canada] did not have to change its laws nor its Constitution for the British royal succession rules to be amended and effective"" and constitutional convention committed Canada to having a lines of succession symmetrical to those of other Commonwealth realms.

Naturally, this was appealed in February of last year but a decision has not yet been reached. Sorry for the wall of text. I do find this stuff interesting and hope someone else will too. 

**TL;DR** We may not have our own law of succession. Constitutional convention suggests that Canada's laws are directly tied to UK law. While the UK removing the sovereign does not guarantee Canada will as well, if the Queen were fired in the UK, it would likely trigger a Commonwealth Realms meeting on the matter. There's no guarantee Canada would follow suit, but [historical precedence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII) and constitutional convention suggests it would.",Canada,/r/europe/comments/ae79f8/randomly_hung_up_a_picture_of_the_queen_roommate/edpwk3h/,Aetheurian,1547136745

This results in record profits for pigs who do nothing.  That is the true worth of their labour.

You could be a world renowned brain surgeon, a researcher who saves millions of lives, a famous musician, a CEO responsible for thousands of people's livelihoods -- in a socialist economy you didn't and wouldn't get paid significantly more than a random bum who lounges at his government-funded apartment and drinks all day.

I am not absolutely sure about that.

If you ask someone in the US, they will very likely tell you so.  Certainly the reason that the US *instituted* separation of powers was because of a belief among those who created its constitutional law that a lack of separation was very dangerous.  And at a gut level, I have a hard time peeling myself away from that.

But in most senses of the word, the UK has very little separation, yet it did not undergo a slide via legal mechanisms into dictatorship.

4526,"&gt; They shouldn‚Äôt be pissed at their fellow west Germans who have spent fortunes upon fortunes to help develop east Germany. 

They didn't have to spend a fortune. They bought up the previous ""people's property"" for a fraction of its value. I mean it's not even controversial anymore that the Treuhand was a major fuckup, as I'm sure you're aware.

&gt; If they had never imposed communism then there would never have needed to be a painful transition since east Germany would have been capitalist the whole time 

People weren't protesting to get capitalism, they wanted free elections, the right to travel, the end of Stasi, and the rule of law. At a later stage also unification with the west, although that point wasn't important early on. Western politicians like Kohl promised them ""flowering landscapes"" and an economic boom if they would unify with West Germany. Before the first free elections, piles of western money were thrown into the campaign, and towards parties/movements that aligned themselves with western parties. They won and pushed through a quick reunification.

That's not necessarily what the original protestors wanted. I mean, a large part of major PDS/Linke politicians were part of the protest movement and pushing for reforms, but they certainly didn't want to introduce capitalism.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/adyi3f/which_coutnry_is_the_biggest_threat_for_germany/edp9n0p/,muehsam,1547115361

The north is the north and the south is the south. The border was going to be drawn somewhere in between, and yes, as everywhere else, borders are often arbitrary, based on military coincidence.

If the north is not a viable state due to the agricultural situation, why is the intervention to blame?

&gt;The UN intervention also extended the war for far longer, resulting in a lot more death and destruction.

Well, if everyone just surrendered when they were attacked, there would be no bloodshed according to you? No, it just means that war would be a lot more attractive *and* more aggressive.

Besides, you may just as well say that the Chinese shouldn't have intervened then.

&gt;Before the war under American rule there were also massacres of communists perpetrated by the South, which continued after the sham elections, elections boycotted by many South Koreans.

4590,"But now you have to look at yourself again. What gives you the moral right to use violence for your goal?   
Yeah some opressed groups have used violence, but the Sturmabteilung also used violence. Just because violence has been used for good is not a good reason to resort to it. I find it pretty arrgant that you, especially in a democratic society, think you have the moral highground to decide when violence is justified, We have the government for that. 

This is why we have a democratic system, if you want something, you can just use your vote to change the rules of your country, and this is where freedom of speech kicks in, it prevents the government from obstructing you in trying to change the law. 

&gt;Because it doesn't. Insult someones mother and they'll smack you in the face. That's a consequence of free speech. Any laws that punish them  afterwards don't say that consequences shouldn't be a part of free speech. Instead they simply punish him for the consequences that were a result of it. 

Again you really like to overuse the word consequence instead of the word violence. And I'm not talking about random consequences, I have made this clear sooo many times already!! We are talking about the AfD guy remember? The guy that got assaulted! The laws against violence are also there to protect you from violence for your speech! This includes both the freedom of speech laws and the laws that prohibit civilians from using violence. 

That doesn't mean that the law protects you from any consequence, I have never claimed that and I don't really know why you are acting like I have (I don't know how many times I will have to repeat this). Physical violence is not part of the system where free-speech is a part of. The government can't use violence directly for speech because of the free-speech law, and because of that law we can trust the government to protect civilians from other civilians using violence without abusing their violence-monopoly.

I don‚Äôt see the AfD maintaining that percentage in the next elections in Bremen. Most of Bremen is vehemently center liberal and due to its geography, hasn‚Äôt had the influx of refugees that other German states have had (refugees are placed in a specific Bundesland and aren‚Äôt allowed to move  - Bremen is tiny and almost entirely a city, and expensive to live in compared to the surrounding Niedersachsen for example). Notably, one of the reasons that Bremen is persistently broke, is that most of the rich people that work in Bremen live outside in the surrounding state of Niedersachsen, where they pay their taxes. I don‚Äôt know any AfD supporters / voters - at least no one that would openly admit it.

Most of us are appalled that a citizen minding his own business has been openly attacked in the street, but equally we are also shocked at how the AfD has tried to use, and more importantly, embellish this for their own propaganda.

The evidence at hand doesn‚Äôt really show that the countries in the euro are really that badly impacted by it but rather it make sense to look at the problems on a more internal level, within those countries. After all Spain has had a pretty decent export growth following the crisis and Italy still maintains a trade surplus so it is pretty clear that the exporters in Southern Europe aren‚Äôt really being that badly hit by it so it doesn‚Äôt make sense to put such a large amount of blame on to it. Not only are the internal reasons for the economies doing pretty badly but the hardest hitted countries also had unstable growth spurts lead by irresponsible lending which made those countries look rather unattractive after the crisis hit, meaning there wasn‚Äôt much of an investment.

Rejecting the notion that currency value has much of a impact on the country‚Äôs economies at hand doesn‚Äôt mean that I think that we have to go back to warn out stereotypes of the Southern European countries being lazy either.

4710,"&gt;The Buyer's Card (""ostukaart"") was a form of photo ID that confirmed that the person was a resident of Estonia, and people who didn't have them (tourists or small time speculants from the rest of USSR), weren't allowed  to buy goods that were in shorter supply.

It makes sense if the goods were effectively subsidized, and while I understand that it's hard to measure that sort of thing in a non-market economy, my understanding is that in effect, that was what happened.

I mean, if you go to Venezuela, they have state-subsidized goods, like gasoline or food or whatever, at below-market rates, and you're restricted from buying them unless you can prove that you're a resident.  This, of course, was popular with people who bought the subsidized goods at below-market rate and smuggled them out to sell at market rate:

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-45179671

&gt;Venezuela's president has said its subsidised fuel prices should rise, to stop smugglers cheating the country out of billions of dollars.
&gt;
&gt;""Gasoline must be sold at an international price to stop smuggling to Colombia and the Caribbean,"" Nicol√°s Maduro said in a televised address.
&gt;
&gt;Like many oil producing nations, Venezuela offers its citizens heavily subsidised petrol.

-

&gt; The price of a litre of petrol in Venezuela currently stands at 1 bolivar. On the black market, Venezuelans pay more than 4m bolivares for one US dollar.
&gt;
&gt;That means that for the equivalent of one dollar, Venezuelans can fill the tank of a medium-sized car about 720 times. ",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ae9t2g/shopping_in_soviet_tallinn_1990/edoztki/,vokegaf,1547101328

Now you're literally making stuff up. Ireland's population was not falling before the famine, the census before the famine was in 1841 and that showed growth and a population of 8.2. Decline was seen in the 1851 census *after* the famine had begun in 1845. Was there emigration beforehand? Of course, but in no way was there population decline. It was still booming before the famine.

&gt;Yet millions moved to British and American cities

A bulk of this happened *during* the famine. Many emigrated on coffin ships to merely survive. 

&gt;what existed was meager 

I already explained to you that it wasn't. Belfast had net positive immigration from Britain not the other way around. Belfast has some of the biggest industries globally and as I said previously historically Dublin was one of the largest cities in the empire. 

The Irish rural population was going through the same transition that the British one did. Some moved to Industry in either Belfast or Dublin while the rest went abroad. The difference is that the Scottish didn't have any industry in their own land to move to, the Irish did.

4829,"&gt;Im simply pointing out that you are lying to get your fallacy across, because the majority of people don't even want to use violence. 

A majority of people don't believe that opposing Nazis makes you as bad as Nazis either. Nor do they believe their lack of action makes them better than those who do.

Hence the problem with your argument. You say I'm criticizing the majority, but I'm not. I'm criticizing the few I likened to Batman in the analogy.

&gt;And yes, I do believe the law to be right and moral. Especially the constitution.

And that is where we differ. I've seen decades of people fighting against the law for what is right. Civil rights, LGBT rights, the list goes on and on. I've seen laws specifically designed to be unjust and immoral. To restrict people unfairly, or protect the power.

I would never consider what the law says to be moral to be the standard of morality. For someone who has grown up in these last few decades watching LGBT people fight for their rights, with *violence* even, I'm surprised you do.

&gt;Freedom of speech has consequences, but those consequences are limited and NEVER include violence. If it does, it isn't freedom of speech. You fundamentally do not understand the concept of free speech, which isn't really a surprise since you are here arguing in favor of political violence. 

Incorrect. Freedom of speech has *never* meant freedom from consequences. You mentioned the constitution earlier, for which I assume you mean the US. Read the First. The government cannot abridge free speech, but where is the part about free speech being freedom from consequences? Nowhere. In fact every single case that the Supreme court has ruled on about free speech has specified that free speech *has* consequences.

If you don't consider the first to be the arbiter of free speech, which is fair, then the value of free speech says nothing about it meaning freedom from consequences.

Everyone is free to speak. Speech isn't consequence free. If you don't like the consequences it's irrelevant. Because free speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences. The mere fact it has consequences shows this.

Like I said; I believe strongly in freedom of speech. More so than you, who says consequences of speech, one of the most valued aspects of free speech, shouldn't be a thing because you don't like it.",,/r/europe/comments/ae6odi/new_details_regarding_attack_on_german_afd/edouz44/,ThatHauntedTime,1547095916

4833,"&gt; In reality, Russia is a declining state that disguises its internal infirmities with external offensives. Russia‚Äôs economy is stagnating.

It sure is. But as for now, its gold reserves [keep growing](https://tradingeconomics.com/russia/gold-reserves) as it obviously prepares for a long confrontation with the West (they are in top-5, I believe, surpassing even China).

The point people seem to miss about Russia is that Kremlin doesn't give a shit about regular Russians. And while they are indeed getting poorer, Putin keeps pouring billions into military and political games.

Besides, since the annexation of Crimea, the number of dollar billionaires in Russia has actually grown up. And their combined assets have grown up. So, yes, the economy IS struggling and stagnating. But the elite keep getting richer. Thus, I'd take these GDP numbers -- or any other statistic for that matter -- with a big grain of salt: if we really want to stop Russia, we need to stop buying gas and oil from them.

4855,"&gt; The problem with encrypting hard boundaries is inflexibility.

That's a general tradeoff that society made when we moved from absolute rulers to written codes of law.  I mean, I can say that about everything that's happened since we moved away from the judge being the local warlord's whim.

But more to the point, I think that if this were a one-off action in the event of a massive catastrophe, as you're proposing, that few would object.  However, if France is permitted ongoing exceptions, as she has had, and the proposed fix is not ""let's update the rules to reflect our *real* criteria"" but ""I suppose we'll just keep granting exceptions to France"", I think that there's legitimate grounds for complaint -- the ""emergency"" argument really isn't applicable.  I think that it's fair to say, at that point, ""maybe the rules we've agreed to are in need of update"".

*But that's just legal nitpicking, unnecessary legalism!*

Let's say that EU Member X is doing just fine in terms of the *real* criteria, but not in terms of the written criteria.  Then Brussels has the political ability to block the member's budget, in full accordance with all the rules, and I think that it's legitimate to say that that's objectionable to a state that would be doing that, if they're meeting the ""unwritten"" criteria.  The fix doesn't need to be ""force France to follow the existing rules"", but if it doesn't actually make financial sense to force France to follow the existing rules, then why is the power reserved to Brussels to override member states who are performing as well as France is?  If it's actually fine and not harmful for a state to be doing what France is doing, then what is the justification for having the power to block such a state's budget?

And politically, I think that having unwritten rules damages the political standing of the written rules.  I mean, what happens next time some national leader says ""we can't spend like that, Brussels says no"", and a public in the EU says ""No, it's been clearly demonstrated that the rules are negotiable.  What you need to do is go back and play hardball.""

4890,"&gt;And the point I'm making is that Scotland's boom is not equally comparable because it was almost half the size so it's not a fair point to treat them identically.

I've not considered them identical. All you're doing by nitpicking the difference between a 150% and 200% increase is showing that you don't understand the point I'm actually making.

&gt; A bulk of this happened during the famine.

No it didn't.

More Irish emigrated during the four years after the famine than emigrated during the entire four years of famine. The Irish population continued to decline for a century due to emigration.

If the bulk of emigration had happened during the famine then the population would have recovered. It didn't because people kept leaving for a hundred years.

If there were so many jobs in Ireland, and people were only leaving to survive, why did millions continue to leave en masse for the next century?

Honestly, how do you rationalise that? Did they just not like Ireland?

&gt;Belfast has some of the biggest industries globally and as I said previously historically Dublin was one of the largest cities in the empire. 

Your argument is that Irish industry wasn't meager compared to what existed in Britain and the US because Belfast existed with a population of 70,000, and Dublin with a population of 350,000?

That's comparable to contemporary Merseyside...

&gt;The difference is that the Scottish didn't have any industry in their own land to move to

&amp;#x200B;

"" Mixed marriages as factors of socio-cultural change Persons in mixed marriages may contribute directly and indirectly to shaping the social and cultural profile of the host population. They themselves cross boundaries between groups, and their descendants are less likely to identify with a single group. Their networks may also gain better knowledge of other group(s), weakening stereotypes. The extent of the presence of these actors in the host population is estimated in Table 2. In the total population, on average across Europe, one person out of 25 of marriageable age brings this potential change. Within each specific subgroup, the proportions are different and are more relevant among foreign-born persons, where sex differentials are also more significant. On average, one foreign-born person out of four of marriageable age is in a mixed marriage. These potential carriers of socio-cultural change are the cumulative result of past migrations and demographic dynamics, and may not be representative of single communities or changing migration patterns (e.g. future immigration flows from new sending countries). Those percentages also depend on the relevance of the institution of marriage, which is differently perceived across Europe. In several countries, alternative forms of consensual union are a reality nowadays. Although they could be considered as crossing looser boundaries than marriages, the significance of these potential socio-cultural forces may be greater than is estimated here, possibly by several percentage points. More uncertain is the role of those who were previously in a mixed marriage, but are divorced at the time of the survey, as their experience may have the opposite influence """,,/r/europe/comments/aeeayf/averages_for_200507_and_200810_of_the_percentage/edojgfz/,Tavirio,1547086387

&amp;#x200B;

The estimates are produced using data primarily from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), supplemented with data from the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC). The population of reference in LFS and SILC (persons living in private households aged 15-16 years and more) is here considered as an estimate of the population of marriageable age (persons capable of contracting a marriage in virtue of their age). The minimum age at marriage and its exceptions are laid down by law; they may differ from country to country and may be different for the two sexes. Persons in mixed marriage are those legally married native-born persons living with a legally married foreign-born partner (same or opposite sex) in private households (and vice versa). The countries included in this study are the 27 Member States of the EU plus 3 countries member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA): Belgium (BE), Bulgaria (BG), the Czech Republic (CZ), Denmark (DK), Germany (DE), Estonia (EE), Ireland (IE), Greece (EL), Spain (ES), France (FR), Italy (IT), Cyprus (CY), Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Luxembourg (LU), Hungary (HU), Malta (MT), the Netherlands (NL), Austria (AT), Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Romania (RO), Slovenia (SI), Slovakia (SK), Finland (FI), Sweden (SE), the United Kingdom (UK), Iceland (IS), Norway (NO) and Switzerland (CH). Data are not available for Switzerland 2005-2007 and for Bulgaria 2005. All statistics presented in this report are experimental and are not part of the regular production of Eurostat.

France is a nuclear power with second strike capability.  Germany will probably not be permitted to be a nuclear power until she federalizes with France, and Germany probably did a good deal to put herself in that position by waging World War II, so in that sense, sure.  Nobody really wants a bunch of nuclear powers that might be opposed to each other running around Europe, and that certainly includes all of the current powers.

If you're claiming that Germany deserves political power because of pure economic strength today that is comparable to France, and in isolation from military capability, there you're wrong.

4997,"&gt;Neither scotland nor wales had a growth rate anywhere near that of Ireland or England and Ireland had an even higher birth rate than England. They grew, but not at the same pace.

The point was that Scotland also had a massive population boom. You've confirmed this with your numbers.

Despite this massive population boom in the Highlands, the region still ended up comparatively deserted.

The population dropped despite an initial boom not because of the very minor Highland famine, but because of chronic economic factors.

These same factors made the rural Irish population unsustainable, regardless of any famine, and are why the population dropped so severely and never recovered.

Suggesting I'm uninformed is incredibly rich if you're honestly going to try and suggest that the famine was the main reason for the population dropping. The Irish population was falling before the famine even begun, and continued to do so until *1960*.

&gt;Belfast was one of the UKs most industrialised cities and a major port with the world's biggest shipyard, as well as the world's biggest linen producer. Dublin was also becoming industrialised alongside other UK cities and was briefly the UK's second largest city.

And yet millions of Irish moved to British and American cities instead?

Sure it does, we aren't living in the wild west. A contract holds. If EU and Greece agree the Greek government must ask EU before committing any funds to extras not mentioned in a preliminary budget shown.

&gt;Which means that they end up selling these assets for cheaper than they normally would be able to. This is, in my opinion, a gangster move by the creditor countries.

It is sad, but it is not a gangster move. The creditors cannot buy the property at any price, you and I can outbid them. Real Estate companies know what is going on if there's a quick buck to be made they are fighting for the properties. They may surely go underpriced, but the price is determined by the markets.

It's similar to if you and I had huge payday loans. If we own a flat we are better off paying off the high-interest loans in full than what we would save not having to pay rent by keeping the flat.

I would say that the status of capital belongs not to the place where HRE were crowned, but where they resided and/or the administration was based. 

So basically Vienna, if we had to choose a place (and this is only true from the late 1200s on, when the Hapsburg were first crowned HREs. Before they would have ceaselessly wandered from place to place), Regensburg, where the Imperial Diet convened most often, and Wetzlar, where the Reichskammergericht was based.

She retreated to a phone booth after the vote and her own brother called her on the phone while she was mobbed by reporters when he told her she that nobody back in Montana supported her.


The Falklands was even worse because it was an actual community of thousands of British citizens who were being actively occupied by invaders while Afghanistan and war on Japan were merely revenge actions for 9/11 and Pearl Harbor.

The emergence of a modern-day Israel fit nicely with that.  Of course, then the Soviet Union fell apart, and so that didn't work out so well:

[Revelation 20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+20&amp;version=NIV;KJV):

&gt;Revelation 20 New International Version (NIV)
&gt;
&gt;**The Thousand Years**
&gt;
&gt; And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain.  He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.  He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time.
&gt;
&gt; I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They[a] had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.  (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.  Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.
&gt;
&gt;**The Judgment of Satan**
&gt;
&gt; When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth‚ÄîGog and Magog‚Äîand to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore.  They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God‚Äôs people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them.  And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
&gt;
&gt;**The Judgment of the Dead**
&gt;
&gt; Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them.  And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.  The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done.  Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.  Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gog_and_Magog

&gt;In the early 19th century, some Chasidic rabbis identified the French invasion of Russia under Napoleon as ""The War of Gog and Magog"".[112] But as the century progressed, apocalyptic expectations receded as the populace in Europe began to adopt an increasingly secular worldview.[113] This has not been the case in the United States, where a 2002 poll indicated that 59% of Americans believed the events predicted in the Book of Revelation would come to pass.[114] During the Cold War the idea that Soviet Russia had the role of Gog gained popularity, since Ezekiel's words describing him as ""prince of Meshek""‚Äîrosh meshek in Hebrew‚Äîsounded suspiciously like Russia and Moscow.[15] Even some Russians took up the idea, apparently unconcerned by the implications (""Ancestors were found in the Bible, and that was enough""), as did Ronald Reagan.[115][116]
&gt;
&gt;Some post‚ÄìCold War millenarians still identify Gog with Russia, but they now tend to stress its allies among Islamic nations, especially Iran.[117] For the most fervent, the countdown to Armageddon began with the return of the Jews to Israel, followed quickly by further signs pointing to the nearness of the final battle‚Äînuclear weapons, European integration, Israel's seizure of Jerusalem, and America's wars in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf.[118] In the prelude to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, President George W. Bush told Jacques Chirac, ""Gog and Magog are at work in the Middle East"". ""This confrontation"", he urged the French leader, ""is willed by God, who wants to use this conflict to erase His people's enemies before a new age begins"".[119] Chirac consulted a professor at the Faculty of Theology of the University of Lausanne to explain Bush's reference.[120]
&gt;
&gt;In the Islamic apocalyptic tradition, the end of the world would be preceded by the release of Gog and Magog, whose destruction by God in a single night would usher in the Day of Resurrection.[121] Reinterpretation did not generally continue after Classical times, but the needs of the modern world have produced a new body of apocalyptic literature in which Gog and Magog are identified as Communist Russia and China.[122] One problem these writers have had to confront is the barrier holding Gog and Magog back, which is not to be found in the modern world: the answer varies, some writers saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are invisible.[123]

One notes that when there are many conflicting and rapidly-changing interpretations of something, it's arguable that no matter how confident someone sounds in their interpretation, it *might* be best to take it with a sizeable chunk of salt.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ae9590/russian_church_leader_smartphones_foreshadow_the/edo2gm4/,vokegaf,1547072744

5245,"&gt; Just like taking out French in matter of weeks.

Yeah, and those tactics didn't work against Russia or the UK.

&gt; Not really, they just focused on the east.

The Battle of Britain was already decisively won by the UK before Barbarosa, and Hitler couldn't afford not focusing on the East. (thus they were already spread thin and running low on manpower)

&gt; Turkey would certainly join axis

That's pure hyperbole.

&gt; which would give them an easy access to whole Middle east/ Africa. 

They already had access in Libya and Tunez, and lost. They simply didn't have the manpower or fuel to fight that far away from Europe, especially with British naval supremacy in the Mediterranean and Italian incompetence.

&gt; Germans had air superiority till mid 1943, so once again irrelevant

Only in the Eastern Front, they already lost it in the West. They couldn't outproduce the Russian factories since their own factories were starting to get bombed and the Luftwaffe was starting to have limited fuel.

&gt; Not to mention volunteers who were willing to fight against communists.

A tiny fraction of men don't change a course of a war

&gt; Yet, the other half was chilling all over Europe.

They weren't chilling, they were garrisoning, fighting partisans, bogged down in Africa, and protecting the Atlantic wall.

&gt; Retreat where? Behind Urals? Thats exactly what Germans wanted.

The Germans wanted to defeat the Soviets decisively, that was the whole purpose of the invasion. That was already an impossible feat.

Elite divisions are only effective if you can supply them. Panzer divisions ran out of fuel and supplies due to over extension. There is a reason the Russians started mounting their main defense in the Leningrad-Moscow-Stalingrad line. It was only a matter of time.

&gt; So saying that it was impossible for the Nazis to win is just pure bs.

It was impossible, they might have inflicted more damage to Russia, but they would have never defeated them, especially with the UK dominating the seas.

&gt;My country not taking part in military interventions in other countries

sad to see a majority thinking it is a good idea, ex. stopping ISIS, helping the people of Syria, you can't help them without military intervention, military intervention includes UN peacekeeping missions, 

military and war is not only bad, we have to stand up to fight tyranny to maximize welfare to the worlds population, a true humanist cannot be against all wars,

a ""humanist"" that is against fighting tyranny and military intervention are not true humanists, they are pacifists. 

NATO intervention is Yugoslavian war was a success and so were US intervention against Nazi Germany in the 2nd world war.


As one of my favorite humanists explains it:

**The Dalai Lama**:
&gt;I want to make it clear, however, that although I am deeply opposed to war, I am not advocating appeasement. **It is often necessary to take a strong stand to counter unjust aggression.**  For instance, it is plain to all of us that the Second World War was entirely justified. It ""saved civilization"" from the tyranny of Nazi Germany, as Winston Churchill so aptly put it.

5346,"&gt;The medias all over the place are pushing the narrative that the UK is royally fucked, is going to collapse into chaos,

""Royally fucked"" and ""collapse into chaos"", can mean a lot. It doesn't necessarily mean that the UK will cease to exist. 

I don't know why you think that one side is going to win and one is going to lose. Sure we don't know. But when it coms to trade, all parties can get a net positive effect. Put shortly, Trade isn't a zero-sum game. But all parts can also lose. I think that is what is most likely to happen. Both the EU an the UK will probably be worse off because of brexit. So why does the media talk so much about the negative effects for UK and not as much for the EU? It's probably because the UK is likely to be affected much more by the negative effects of a no deal brexit. Most likely because of the fact that the UK's economy is much smaller than the EU's economy. The EU will most likely be affected negativelt by brexit, but not as severely. I don't think that it is in anyones interest to have a no deal brexit. A free trade agreement would solve many problems, but then the UK would have to obey many of the EU's laws. They don't want that.

All in all. It seems like you think that if there is a winner there has to be a loser. That is sometimes true, but not when it comes to trade, which is a big part of the brexit negotiations, it is not.

5363,"A good analogy would be Batman. You've heard of him right? He has an enemy called the Joker. A vile man who only causes harm. Who *wants* to. He loves it. He's a cancer on society.

Batman could stop him. Put an end to his constant threat. But he won't. Because Batman considers himself a good person. But if someone came along and did what Batman couldn't, say his partner Robin did, the what do you think Batman would say? He'd tell Robin that he's no better than the Joker. He would call him a bad person.

Robin solved Batman's problem. And even though Batman didn't stop the Joker, he gets to pat himself on the back and act like he's a good person for doing nothing. Even better, he gets to call the person who solved Batman's problem for him, and made the world a better place, a bad person.

So what's the point of this analogy? You're like Batman. Fascists threaten innocent peoples lives. It's their aims. Their goals. But if someone stands up to them, you'd call them a bad person who is no better.

5365,"&gt;So with all the respect for charming Islamic ornaments, Islam brought nothing to development of construction, and without it we can not talk about development of architecture.

1. Vaults aren't even used anymore due to modern construction materials so Medieval Western architecture also added nothing to the development of modern architecture.
2. Vaulted ceilings were mainly characteristic of churches and other ceremonial public buildings whose only purpose was to convey awe. The high ceilings and rooms without pillars were not actually useful for anything. As such, they were themselves purely ornamental. 
3. Architecture is defined as 'the design and construction of buildings'. Given that Islamic architecture was instrumental in pioneering design trends that radiated well into the Christian world, it's not remotely true to say that because superlatives in quantitative measures such as roof area and height were reached in Christendom, Islamic civilisation did not contribute to the development of architecture. Not to mention that modern Islamic architecture has now excelled Western architecture in those measures (and no, it's not only Western architects, there are also groundbreaking Muslim architects such as Zaha Hadid).
4. No Western building equals the beauty of the Taj Mahal. If you value superlatives then that's a mark of your Western cultural upbringing - in Asian culture expense, symmetry and ornament are more important than height or ceiling area. Comparing Western buildings to Eastern ones in the way you are doing is rather like saying that Western women are objectively superior to Asian women because they are taller. The reality is that according to Asian beauty standards being tall is a negative not a positive.

5434,"For the people downvoting, there has been a multitude of evidence to suggest that it wasn't mere crony-capitalism and apathy behind the deaths of the famine. Intent was evident. 

The British leader in charge of sending aid to the Irish is on record to have purposely refrained from sending aid because he described it as ""teaching the Irish a lesson"". 

British land owners in Ireland purposely evicted those who were suffering and exported food *away* from the starving despite the fact that the number of cattle had actually increased during the famine, not to mention the fact that apartheid British policies is the entire reason why the Irish population were over reliant on potatoes In the first place. ""*a mass of poverty, disaffection, and degradation without a parallel in the world. It allowed proprietors to suck the very life-blood of that wretched race*"" is a direct quote from a newspaper published by 'The Times' during the famine when describing how the government dealt with British land owners and starving Irish. There were also laws that forbid Irish catholics from purchasing their own land after they were already pushed from the best pasture land which means they couldn't possibly farm even if they had the know how.

The colonial adminstrator of the ruling administration at the time is on record to have called the famine an ""effective mechanism for reducing surplus population"" as well as ""the judgement of God"" and wrote that ""The real evil with which we have to contend is not the physical evil of the Famine, but the moral evil of the selfish, perverse and turbulent character of the [Irish] people"".

Respectfully, you'd have to be delusional to tell me that there was no intent. 

I'll say that Robert Peel, the British PM at the time, did seem to be very sympathetic. But Robert peel was only the prime minister for one year during the blight, he himself seemed to care, but others in his government did not. The rest of his party and other parties disagreed with Peels empathetic opinion of the Irish so much that anti-irish sentiment is listed as the main reason for him being forced to resign. He approved a sum of money to be sent to assist Irish catholics and it was hated and opposed by the majority of other party members. His proposed policies to punish anybody perpetuating in a ""food war"" against the Irish was also shot down by parliament.

As for queen victoria, there's no evidence of her displaying compassion for the irish during her rule and the famine, she had never even visited Ireland once until it worsened years later and she was formerly requested to go. She donated 2,000 through a British agency(only after peel begged her in a personal letter), which was paltry given the circumstances. But even with her donation it actually only ended up ensuring that more money stayed out of Ireland because the royal laws at the time stated that *nobody* could donate anymore than herself. Which she knew would happen. There's even document evidence of the British Embassy refusing to allow the sultan of turkey to donate 10,000 to the Irish because it was more than the queen donated. 

You could perhaps argue that logistical errors could have been one of the causes for the lack of aid. But If it was merely ""logistics"" that caused delays and mistakes in supplies and aid (despite those in charge of aid on record saying that they delayed it purposely), then why when a similarly large blight began to occur In the Scottish Highlands was it quelled quickly and efficiently before it became a famine? Yet, rest assured they continuesly delayed and sent supplies to the wrong districts for *7 years* in Ireland.",√âire,/r/europe/comments/ae4isr/european_countries_with_economy_smaller_than/edn58o8/,Im_no_imposter,1547050681

5685,"That makes no sense since 'fin' as in fine is a long i sound while 'finn' in Swedish is a long one. The actual etymology is unknown but probably Germanic, possibly related to the verb 'finna' (finders.. as in a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle). 

In the oldest Old Norse sources it's often unclear whether the term is referring to Sami or Finns though, as the term was used for both (e.g. the name Finnmark in Norway refers to Sami while Finnmark in Sweden refers to areas where Forest-Finns lived) In the early Scandinavian Middle Ages when the term Finnar was used for present day Finns it only referred to people from Finland Proper; the others were Tavaster (H√§m√§l√§iset), Savonians, Karelians and so on. _Tavast_ is a fairly interesting word too since it's probably from a lost Finnish dialectal word. 

Tacitus was most likely directly or indirectly getting his information from a Germanic source, as there were Scandinavians and other Germanic peoples serving as mercenaries in the Roman legions in the first century AD. (around the same time the runic alphabet was created based off Old Italic, and many other roman influences start showing up in north Germany and Scandinavia. Hence the Iron Age is divided into pre-Roman and Roman periods there, including in Finland even if the Roman influences were later there (and the big changes start arriving first in the Migration Period and Merovingian era)",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/ae4gl0/greetings_from_frozen_narnia_that_some_people/edmmgav/,Platypuskeeper,1547036435

5687,"&gt;The UK is an easy place to do business. I mean let's cut the bullshit: even after March 29 it will still be easier to do business in London than in Paris.

If you rely on EU market access, then doing business will become a whole heck more difficult after March 29. If, for instance, you currently have passporting rights and sell a majority of your services to countries in the EU, then you'll probably lose most, if not all, of your business. 

&gt;The UK is even more advantaged than Switzerland or Norway in the sense that on top of having their own Fiat currency

And yet, both the Swiss and the Norwegian understand the importance of good relations with the EU. Both have deals in place that cover a bunch of topics. 

&gt;they have a large working-age well educated English speaking population.

The ""well educated"" bit is certainly debatable. I wouldn't put the education level of Brits above the education levels of the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, etc. And most of the EU member states have a continuously increasing English speaking population. Their advantage is however that they can generally speak more than one language. It's somewhat awkward seeing friends speaking four or five languages fluently without hesitation. 

&gt;I mean if you look at what's happening Economically in the advanced western part of the EU, in particular in Italy, France or Spain, I am pretty confident that in the long term (20 years+) the UK is **way way less fucked** 

And yet, France manages to have a GDP similar to that of the UK. Quite telling to see a nation that has seen a strike pretty much every day of 2018 manages to give the UK a run for its money. 

&gt;If you actually take the time to think 20 years ahead, the alternative (May's deal) really doesn't make a lot of sense.

A Brexiteer recently suggested that it'd take about 28 months to negotiate a trade deal. Setting aside that this is overly optimistic (most trade deal negotiations take anywhere between 4 and 8 years), it would take nearly 22 years to negotiate deals to replace those that we have via the EU. That figure assumes that we negotiate 4 trade deals simultaneous, something we don't have the staff or the means to do. Negotiating them one by one would take at least 86 years. 

And yes, it's important to look 20 years ahead. In a globalised, US/China-centred economy, it's even more important to be part of a free trade area that protects its members from outside intrusions. 

&gt;Sure, they might loose a few GDP points for a few years but at the end of the day the United Kingdom *is an advanced Western Economy*.

The UK has a nominal GDP of $2.936 trillion. A ""few GDP points"" is a lot of unemployed. 

&gt;They have *a lot* of money and If they can't buy shit in the EU they will buy it somewhere else. Basic supply/demand. 

The average British household doesn't have that much disposable income. Price hikes on essentials could spell trouble for those households.

5847,"Since the loans are in local currency and have a fix return it shouldn't lead to housing market crash. Plus the loans are guaranteed by the government, which means banks can't overdo and crash. The EU just got triple-secured against another banking sector crash too.

Construction sector was way below EU average in Hungary, especially the housing market was deprived, with costs so high only rich people built new houses. And you can't expect the top 1% to sustain the housing market, so the intervention I think was well placed. In the first years mostly it was like the rich got richer, loads of investment-oriented buildings were raised, but the population quickly cought up and houses are still being built, construction companies can barely keep up with the need. Which should, in the long run mean tons of new homes on the market, prices going lower, people being more and more able to afford homes. The government aid will stay for the long run it seems, the current government is really bent on trying to increase population.

Last I've looked lack of homes is a serious problem in most western countries. And decreasing population too. We'll see if it works, it's definitely more than nothing.",,/r/europe/comments/ads4ms/examples_of_parties_in_eu_that_represent/edmdjow/,Nerevaryne,1547022065

USA does not allow to Israel, to sell their F-16's, upgraded to F-16's Baraks, to Croatia?

Does our government have over that in the USA? Shit! Never heard of that.

Also Israel should not be blamed in this process that much either. They wanted to sell us upgraded F-16's. Yes they were old, but not junk as everybody in Croatian news portrayed it. That's why we wanted to buy them. If they were junk USA would not terminate all of this.

Israel probably thought that same job could be done with them, if Baraks for Croatia got green light, those will get it to. They are all NATO members. Israel and USA are allies. Croatia doesn't hold some special position there. Well, shit. Americans didn't thought so, and now nobody gets those planes.    

People want Krsticevic (Minister of Defense) to resign. Are they fucking nuts. This shit looks to me like fucking matrix where am I surrounded by bunch of idiots.

Only thing we should reconsider from all of this is, how much is USA reliable as our ally.    
We are not the first one who got screwed doing this kind of bussiness with them.    

- Turkey invested $195 millions in F-35 program and still has not received single of planes they should got. USA is blocking it.    
- Turkey wanted to purchase their Predator UCAVs. USA blocked it.    
- Turkey wanted to purchase air defense systems from them and some other allies. They didn't want to sell those to Turks. And went mad after they bought Russian ones. Retarded right.    
- Germany wanted to buy Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk UAVs. At first they didn't want to sell them to Germans. Then agreed to sell them 5. Process was slow as fuck. Germans got one which is unable to fly. Missing crucial parts. Germans terminated the contract.

5926,"&gt;I think taxes paid by the employer are fine though. Also in the end it's  not like this money evaporates, it's used mostly to help the poor  through free education, healthcare and public services.

Yeah, but the portion paid by the employer goes to the total cost of the employee just like a wage. The portion paid by the employer comes out of the employee's pocket. The employer wouldn't be just pocketing all that money. 

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I think taxes paid by the employer are fine  though. Also in the end it's not like this money evaporates, it's used  mostly to help the poor through free education, healthcare and public  services.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the USA you don't pay as much taxes but then you have to pay tens of thousands for college education, so what's the point?

So I mean I paid $200,000 to go to an Ivy League school for 4 years because my family has loads of money. My girlfriend paid nothing to go to state school at LSU because in-state tuition is $9,000 and they give free tuition to smart people. The people in my fraternity who were poor at my Ive League school were on full financial aid and only paid a few thousand dollars. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, I am rich, and I was subsidizing the kids on financial aid at my uni to an extreme amount. And college is better in the US than France. Like the Universities just have more funding, more services, etc.. I'm not just talking about the Grande Ecoles vs. the Ivy league, like a standard State School in the US has way more funding. In France you can pass the Bac and got to a school for free just so that 50% can dropout because the universities are starved of money. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

91.2% of people in the US **HAVE** health insurance. It's not like people are dying like flies. The government pays for poor people to have health insurance through medicaid. I actually wish that our healthcare system was like France's, but that wouldn't require us to increase payroll taxes 400% from 15.3 to 60% to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

And yeah, wages, and especially after tax income in the US is way higher than in France because of all those payroll taxes and VAT. There is something to be said for the fact that people actually have more money in their pocket for the work that they do. It's not like people live just to hand over money to the state. There is more to life 

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, you realize that it hurts France's economy? France has had super high unemployment for years, even before 2008. By having high payroll taxes it actually costs employers a ton of money to hire people, which discourages hiring. If you put a tax on just the legal right to employ a poor person then that means fewer poor people with jobs.

First of all, saying that rich people pay for poor people's college degrees in the USA is just ridiculous. There was $1.4 trillion in student debt in 2016. Not sure why you would even start arguing such things.

American universities definitely have more funding and services than in France, that's for sure. At least for the ones I know. However I wouldn't say the level of students reflect that at the undergrad level, quite the contrary actually. I have been a TA for about 4 years and the level was pretty much a disaster. It feels like paying students are entitled to their degree even if they are terrible. The undergrad level is generally much worse than in France IMO. It gets better at the grad level because the USA imports a lot of foreign students (there was basically no American in my PhD group).

American people do have health insurance, it's just that it's working extremely bad. Americans pay more for a service that is in average worse than in Europe. Of course, if you live in America and you're rich you'll be able to access the best medical system in the world. Otherwise, better not get cancer.
