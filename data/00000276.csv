16,"&gt; They are the same ethnicity

They are only the ""same ethnicity"" since 1918.

&gt; and speak the same language as Azeris in Iran.

As well as people from Turkey.

&gt; All Azerbaijani means is ""Person from Azerbaijan (region).""

The Republic of Azerbaijan is not really Azerbaijan. They just artificially changed the name of their land to Azerbaijan in 1918 so they could annex the real Azerbaijan in Iran.

&gt; Even though the Russians called them Tatars, doesn't mean they didn't identify as Azeri (like the Azeris in south during this period).

Regardless of what Russians called them, Shirvanis never identified as Azerbaijani before 1918.

&gt; They distinctly developed Azerbaijani nationalism (people like Khoyski), and there was Azerbaijani nationalism in the south (Pishevari) where they wanted a united Azerbaijan, to unite the people - all with Soviet help of course.

Yes. The name change in May 1918 was used by Shirvanis for irredentism to try to claim Iranian-Azerbaijan. It would be like if tomorrow Serbia were to change it's name ""Croatia"" and then try to annex Croatia to ""reunite Croatia"".

&gt; Do you have any sources, because I am really interested as an Azeri.

Just look up maps on Caucasian Albania or read about them and you'll see the only language spoken there for the most part was Albanian (a Northeast Caucasian language). Iranian-Azerbaijan and the southern tip of Shirwan were Median-speaking before. Maybe if you read [this](http://kavehfarrokh.com/articles/pan-turanism/question-3-how-and-when-did-the-myth-of-a-north-azarbaijan-and-south-azarbaijan-originate/) you can get a clearer picture of what I'm talking about.

Persian was promoted when it was part of Persia, but it was never the majority language or close to the majority ever. Shirwan was ruled by the Arsacid Parthians for centuries too but that doesn't mean it was a former Parthian-speaking land.

&gt; There were Persians settling Caucasian Albania, in fact, spreading Zoroastrianism to the Albanians. If anything, the ones north are a mix of Persians and Albanians.


The Persians still live in the Caucasus today and they are called ""Tats"" and speak a distinctive variety of Persian. The word *Tat* is a Turkic word meaning ""outsider"" by the way. They had little to no influence there as their numbers were too small. They all came in the Sassanid era. They didn't only live in Shirwan but in all of the Caucasus. There are some still in Chechnya and Dagestan as well.

&gt; Azeris south never mixed with Albanians, but have mixed with the Azeris north.

What does that mean? North Azeris are Albanians. They just forgot their language.

&gt; Medians united with Persians, calling themselves Persians (Pars or Parsa). Persians and Medians are both Iranic, but one group assimilated with the other. Just like Scythians assimilated with Slavs/Turkic people, and the Saka's became Turkic - Bulgar Turks becoming Slavic, etc. Assimilation is a common theme.

I don't know how many Medians got Persianized, but a lot didn't before the Turkification of the region. The Talysh language is a direct descendant of Median and has almost a million native speakers in Iranian-Azerbaijan. It is only really spoke in the far north along the coast of the Caspian Sea though, so the inland regions might have been Persianized before the Turkification. But my point was that the original language of Iranian-Azeris at the point of their ethnogenesis was Median and then they got Turkified later.

I am not saying, that women are like robots or things, and they should shut their mouth and stay at home in kitchen. Because, that is what people usually think, when they read comments like that. This is just thinking about consequences.

Following a meeting with Bulgaria’s prime minister on Wednesday, the president of the European Commission said he “bluntly” supported the country’s application to adopt the euro. Bulgaria’s lev has been pegged to the euro since the single currency was introduced in 1999. “I have to say bluntly that Bulgaria is ready [for euro membership]. And if Bulgaria is applying I support this heartily”, said Mr Juncker.
Jean-Claude Juncker has thrown his weight behind Bulgaria becoming the newest member of the eurozone, as Brussels pushes for all the countries in the EU to adopt the common currency. Following a meeting with Bulgaria’s prime minister on Wednesday, the president of the European Commission said he “bluntly” supported the country’s application to adopt the euro. Bulgaria’s lev has been pegged to the euro since the single currency was introduced in 1999. “I have to say bluntly that Bulgaria is ready [for euro membership]. And if Bulgaria is applying I support this heartily”, said Mr Juncker.  Following the UK’s decision to leave the EU, the Commission has been on a push to encourage the seven countries outside the eurozone to adopt the single currency by offering “pre-accession” aid to governments who decide to take the road to membership. Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and the Czech Republic are currently non-euro members, while Denmark has a permanent opt-out. European leaders will be holding a special “euro” summit of all EU countries with the exception of the UK in December. EU officials think Bulgaria is a prime candidate to become the 20th member of the eurozone, given its existing euro peg and compliance with the “Maastricht convergence criteria” on budget deficits and government debt. Mr Juncker said he “admired” Bulgaria’s economic performance and healthy public finances: “Public debt has reached the level of 29 per cent which is excellent”.

Sorry, that's just not true. If you're a min wage worker in a place like McDonalds, you're generating very little value.

That job can be performed by anyone and as such isn't worth a lot; it can and will soon be done by robots. This idea that most of the value is generated on the bottom and is stolen by the top is the biggest fraud perpetrated by Marxists. If that were true, you could simply start your own business and claim all those easy gains for yourself. After all, if those who control the means of production are raking in the dough for no effort, you should start a business.

As someone who actually lives in one of those countries, the reason it stopped existing was because it was built on debt and lies. The state owned companies were inefficient and weren't producing any value, they only existed because they were propped up by state loans. The only value generating activities were tourism and natural resources because it depended on western capitalists buying them. The debt generated by this system can only be maintained for so long and once the reality caught up with us, the house of cards collapsed. And most of state owned companies went bankrupt in the following years because they weren't worth shit and weren't doing anything. They existed because they state promised people jobs so it gave free money to the company to pay the workers for producing nothing.

I've worked extremely hard to bring my girlfriend who is from the Philippines to come and live in England with me and it's outrageous that the EU courts ruled that they still retain the right to bring their partners to the UK but magically bypass the UK requirements because they are not technically from the UK...

It's times like this that I really want to slap the courts for having a lack of common sense because whilst I understand their plight I don't see why they should get a freebie. 

At the same time that I fell in love, I lost my job further down the line and it's been a nightmare looking for work but not just any work, something specifically over immigrations earning requirements.

We've been trapped in a position where we have essentially been forced to live apart even though I live with my family who could have supported her on my behalf for a short time. Immigration made it feel as if our relationship was a crime.

I have the work and income now that I needed but to read this when I've done everything right, at every step of the way just makes me want to cry. Mainly on my partners behalf because I know she's had a really tough time of it. I'm not going to elaborate but honestly it's been extremely demanding and stressful on both our accounts. It's the biggest kick in the teeth England could have given me after everything I've done to provide towards the nation.

Not that I would care anyway but I would like to make a point that this isn't some trophy wife either, we met abroad at work and we both fell in love (she's actually a year older than me). I mention this because even I myself read skeptically when someone is in agony at 65 trying to bring over their 20 year old wife.... Yes true love might happen but I'm a realist and I highly doubt that the majority of the time that those are cases of true love.

196,"&gt;They were two different ethnic groups historically but because Shirvanis renamed their land to ""Azerbaijan"" in 1918, they magically became the same ethnic group as the Azeris from Iran from that period onward.

They are the same ethnicity and speak the same language as Azeris in Iran. All Azerbaijani means is ""Person from Azerbaijan (region)."" Even though the Russians called them Tatars, doesn't mean they didn't identify as Azeri (like the Azeris in south during this period). They distinctly developed Azerbaijani nationalism (people like Khoyski), and there was Azerbaijani nationalism in the south (Pishevari) where they wanted a united Azerbaijan, to unite the people - all with Soviet help of course. 

What is known, is that Persians and Turks want to erase the Azeri identity to assimilate the people. 

&gt;Azeris (only the ones in the south) were Iranic but that's different to being Persian.

They were Persian, Azeri was a Persian language just like Kurmanci during those times was a Persian language. Dari is a Persian language as well, spoken in Afghanistan. Azeri was just a different dialect of Persian, just like north and south Azeri have different dialects. There are different dialects among Iranian Azeris as well (Tabrizi dialect, Ardabili dialect, etc). Nizami for instance (who is an ancestor to Azeri people) was a Persian during those times, before Turkic invasions.

&gt;South Azeris are Turkified Medians whereas North Azeris are Turkified Lezgics.

Do you have any sources, because I am really interested as an Azeri. There were Persians settling Caucasian Albania, in fact, spreading Zoroastrianism to the Albanians. If anything, the ones north are a mix of Persians and Albanians. Azeris south never mixed with Albanians, but have mixed with the Azeris north. 

Medians united with Persians, calling themselves Persians (Pars or Parsa). Persians and Medians are both Iranic, but one group assimilated with the other. Just like Scythians assimilated with Slavs/Turkic people, and the Saka's became Turkic - Bulgar Turks becoming Slavic, etc. Assimilation is a common theme.

216,"&gt; Thanks for the riveting thought for me to dwell on.

It's important to remind people of the things they forget.

&gt; And neither do I for European countries because we're all already in NATO, a defensive pact with nearly everyone, and therefore would have to defend each other anyway. The only difference is whether the public would be specifically happy about it.

When has NATO been tested? It has so far acted as a deterrent because no one wants to challenge America. Go read polls on how willing the Germans are to go to war to defend other NATO members. Americans are more willing to go to war over the Baltics than Germans are, and that says a lot imo.

&gt; I mean, you could just link me if you had any actual evidence at hand.

I'm not going to do all the work of linking evidence that you will just dismiss anyway. Go do the research for yourself. You clearly haven't done it yet.

&gt; That isn't true at all. There is no desperate situation for starters, and you also how no clue what you're talking about. Polish and German militaries are already cooperating on a regular basis. They have signed deals over this as well. When's the last time Poland signed a deal with America on military cooperation? NATO? You just have a stereotypical America-centric view of everything. You think it all has to revolve around America and if it doesn't then it's probably a fucked up situation. In addition, Germany has signed several cooperation agreements with neighbouring countries on military integration. So have MANY other country combinations within the EU, things like EU Battlegroup operate with the express duty of integrating the military forces of the EU by allowing them to train together as a unit, and it unifies many countries. Taking it one step further is not some unattainable goal. I suggest you do more research next time before assuming that, despite decades of cooperation, European countries still hate and distrust each other.

Haha. First of all, I am Polish. I have lived in Poland, and have family there. I speak the language. So yes, I know what is going on in Poland. The reason I have an American flair is because I have citizenship and live here, and it does not make any sense to me to use a Polish flair when I am a citizen of both but not actually living there now.

Of course they cooperate, they're neighbors. That means nothing. People actually on the ground do not trust or believe that the Germans will come to save them from Russia or anyone else. Everyone is skeptical, especially if they are aware of the business deals that Germans have with the Russians, like Nord Stream 2 as an example. And they have every right to be after the betrayal they experienced in WW2. 

&gt; Well that's funny because plenty of economists are already saying the Euro may eventually overtake the Dollar as the world's reserve currency... And America never used to be the world's reserve currency either, and yet it stayed a stable Union for the most part.

It will never happen because the EU is not stable enough for that to happen. It is structurally flawed.

&gt; You basically asked and answered a question in one here. Yes, I do believe they would be happy to send their money to the east, BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE. Poland has been invested in by Germany for decades, that's why they've been doing so well over time. In addition, it's not Germany's decision, it's the Presidents, his branch makes the budget which is allocated to whatever country and area they decide needs it, and I believe Parliament passes it, and they usually pass it. Stop thinking Germany controls everything.

Not for free. Germany did not just hand Poland money for nothing, they were developing a market that they could export to. The roads were built for trucks to carry German goods into the country. If you believe that people just felt so sorry for Poland and wanted to uplift people there so badly, then you are dangerously naive. Greece was not under Communist occupation and did not suffer the same destruction as Poland. So why would anyone be ok with sending them money? And oh god, not this meme. You are fully drinking the koolaid here if you don't believe that the Germans have more say than most countries on what happens.

&gt; Wait what? Nobody has lost identity here. Germany still remains a productive powerhouse, France retains it's massive cultural history, and Britain still makes a significant chunk of the world's music and movies. Think about New Yorkers, they seem to have their own strong state-identity, despite being American, right? Because one does not remove the other. I feel like everything you say here is some kind of subtle dig at us, we are not children, don't treat us like it.

If the Germans, French, and British still had a strong sense of identity and their values, they would not so willingly invite an ideology that completely opposes them. You live in the bubble and appear to drink from the same pond as the cultural mainstream, so this will sound strange to you, but many outsiders look upon your countries in horror when they see what you are doing. By 2051, if things continue as they are, Muslims will become 17,000,000 strong in the UK. The country will be irrevocably changed, if it is not already. 

Is that really what defines a strong culture to you? How much music and movies you export? I'm not talking about your share of influence on the world stage. I'm talking about the people and their sense of unity and purpose as a society. If you feel like my comments are a dig, then good. You should feel that way. What your people are doing is shameful.

&gt; Fair point but those countries do have a sense of reliance, because they are in many ways reliant on the EU for funding, because it redirects money to them.

Is that your version of a dig? You know it's very amusing to read from you that EU countries are united and friendly, and then watch you bash the East for receiving EU funds. Yeah, I can certainly feel the love...

&gt;Azerbaijan refused to accept their decision to join Armenia

How would they even join Armenia? You should open up a map and see see that Nagorno Karabakh is surrounded by Azerbaijanian lands. Lands that are 100% Azerbaijanian or I should say were 100% Azerbaijanian because Armenians have ethnically cleansed Azerbaijanians from those lands.

Here is the source for that: https://i.imgur.com/XfIIUxw.jpg

All of those green areas you see were 100% Azerbaijanian and the yellow area was Azerbaijanian in majority. Now tell me how is the red area going to join Armenia without declaring war on Azerbaijan and occupying territories of Azerbaijan? You were talking about the Soviet law, explain to us how the law works in this scenario without Armenians declaring war on Azerbaijan.


By the way I can make the same argument you made for Turkish Cypriots. After the British rule of Cyprus ended and Cyprus became independent the Turkish Cypriots didn't want the Cyprus to become a part of Greece but the Greek Cypriots refused to accept this decision of Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots committed many massacred against Turkish Cypriots after that Turkey intervened to help Turkish Cypriots.

444,"&gt;Modern day regions in Europe don't have ethnic conflict because of some vague, irrational sense of orthodoxy slavness that has to dominate every single place a Serb touches.

There might not be today but recognizing regions that unilaterally declare independence don't help anyone. Also the ""Orthodox slavness"" would have never been  a relevant point in Kosovo if the Albanians didn't start burning Orthodox churches and monasteries to the ground. Even today if KFOR troops wouldn't guard those places there would be nothing more but heaps of ruin.

&gt;And in the NEXT GOD DAMN PARAGRAPH you advocate exactly for that

And where have I advocated for expulsion or ethnic cleansing?

&gt;It's not all about Serbia.

Well Kosovo is at least partly about Serbia. It is our historical center, it is also the heart of Serb culture and to be blunt, as long as the government of Serbia won't recognize Kosovo's independence, Kosovo is going to be about Serbia.


&gt;Let me get this straight, you want me to believe, after speaking to so many Serbs, reading their news, forums, comment sections and some discord groups, that Serbs are capable of applying the same level of ethnic tolerance as us ? Please stop fucking with me.

That seems like quite a bit of prejudice to me and seems to me that you started this debate with a closed, and already made-up mind. So why are you here?

&gt;Only you people seem so obsessed with it to this pathological degree that's proven time and time again to be harmful to your countries' interests. Get this in your head : Russians do NOT give a fuck about the interests (imagined or real) of Serbia, only inasmuch as you can cause unrest in Europe. The more your country hurts in useless wars that are a thorn for the West, the better. That is the harsh truth of Russian balkanic policy.

 No,it has nothing to do with the country's interests.

This is a very strange reading of events in SA.  Even if women are now allowed to drive a car, the fact is that SA is one of the most retarded and despicable regimes on the planet, in addition to being the primary promoter of terrorism. The so-called drive against corruption is nothing but a power-struggle that shows just how recklessly the new rulers are going full-out for conflict in Yemen, Qatar, Syria, Lebanon and god knows where.

The only argument for propping up the Saudis is that a militant Islamist regime may even be worse. Even though, looking at the exploits of the Saudi regime, one has to wonder if that could possibly be true.

For “being defensive” what do you expect when you won’t leave people alone to talk among themselves and feel some weird compulsion to wade in telling people they are talking wrong? If you loonies didn’t turn up all the time nobody would need to be “defensive”. Leave us alone.

Finally, (and I can’t believe this has to be pointed out for the zillionth time), “the British Isles” is not a political term, but a geographical one. Just like North America vs. The United States of America.

568,"The reason why many Serbs are unsure or even have negative opinion on the EU isn't because of ""Russian propaganda"", it's because the EU is completely in favor of Kosovo. As much as I despise the Serbian government, they are being as diplomatic and lenient on the Kosovo issue as humanly possible but the Kosovar government doesn't want ANY compromise. Not only they don't want to give Serbia Northern Kosovo (which is predominantly populated by Serbs), they don't even want to give Northern Kosovo autonomy. The Kosovars basically demand us to sign every one of their demands and the EU that should be a mediator is being complicit and passively agrees to everything that Kosovo wants.

On another note, the reason why many Serbs have a positive view on Russia has again nothing to do with ""russian propaganda"". Serbia's and Russia's friendly relations go back to early XIX century when they helped us in Serbia's fight for independence against the Ottoman empire. It's true that Russia had its own motives but they helped when no one did and without Russia's help Serbia alone would've never been able to secure for itself an autonomic princedom  and later, independence. They also helped us in both world wars and there is a cultural unity between the two nations as both of them are Slavs and Orthodox.

Personally I am more in favor of the EU because it makes more sense geopolitically and economically. Russia is too far away and we simply can't rely on Russia when all of our developed neighbours are already EU members. I don't think there's gonna be a referendum on whether we want to join or not but If the EU genuinely wants to increase the EU supporters then they should convinces my people that they have our interests in mind.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/7cwjj3/eu_officials_warn_of_underestimating_russian/dptl06t/,Petique,1510690512

578,"&gt; Some people did change. They were many pre-war anti-Semites, who helped Jews during the war, out of simple human decency, or religious values (Kossak-Szczucka is best-known example here).
Still, these are individual deeds, which doesn't change opinion about organisation as a whole.

Mosdorf didn't ""change"". Communist propaganda tried to portrait him as the one who broke with the Nationalists. He clashed with the Jews over economic/political influence in the young Polish state, and when they started facing physical destruction his Catholicism kicked in.

Nationalists were a mixed bunch, this is why they split many times.

&gt; That too, Hitler remembered the WW 1. But it doesn't change my point - if Nazis wanted a Polish Quisling, they would find one. Probably nobody significant, but still. Notice, that when they tried on lower level with Górals, they found enough to establish a ""Goralische Committee"". Which doesn't mean, that these traitors were really representative for whole community.

My issue is not with possibility/impossibility per se, but with what people will remember from the exchange. The usual ""Poles did not collaborate with Hitler"" is much closer to the truth than ""Poles did not collaborate BUT REMEMBER it's because Hitler didn't want them to"". He didn't want collaborators because Poles did not make good collaborators.

604,"&gt; So the judiciary and government.were aligned in opposition to any drive towards independence. Which means taking.the legal route would.be entry futile. I mean the PP blocked greater autonomy, then just decided to ignore the issue. 

Dude they could have went with the legal route when the PSOE was in power. But they decided to go for an estatut that grants them quite some special privileges - in return they fulfilled very little demands from the spanish government - back then the PSOE. As a result some people turned to vote PP in order to stop giving special privileges to certain autonomies. 

Its a democracy. A lot of people of one region want something - great. But obviously if you want something that impacts the whole country you need the support from the whole country. Would it be futile? Maybe. You cant be certain that your wish always gets fulfilled.

In any case it atleast could bear fruit. Not like illegal referendums. That will get you nowhere as the catalonian parliament itself very well knew.

I agree Stalin was first among thugs - he prevailed in the struggle against equal thugs, but he was not by any means the only cold-blooded killer in the early Soviet Union, and he lived his life surrounded by similar Soviet killers. And yes, I agree that anyone would have done the same in his place - the way the early USSR was built unfortunately encouraged it. It was fundamentally a system of power and terror - its successes and its failures were driven by both. 

I only mention Stalin as someone different because he was the man directly responsible for what occurred in the end - him and his coterie of subordinate murderers, from Yagoda to Yezhov to Beria. No doubt someone else would have done the same, but history is not what-ifs - it is what happened, and Stalin is what happened. My point was exactly the same as yours - that he was not an omnipotent Satan who drank the blood of Soviet babies and imprisoned kindergartners. He was a mass murderer who lived in a time of mass murderers, and his actions were those of a logical, calculating man. A cold man. A ruthless man. But a logical man of the times.

766,"&gt; Leaving a political union which, in the long term, is going to destroy sovereignty and national identity, is not 'destroying the economic fortune of your country'.

Leaving the Union means that Great Britain stands alone in a world which is dominated by Multiple Superpowers (Multipolar world) and won´t be able to profit from the EU common market or its political weight.

Leaving the EU will ensure that the UK will loose its National Sovereignty in the long term, because it doesn´t have enough weight to make an impact in world politics on its own.

&gt; The Chinese government realises it is in their national interests to control this area, and uses nationalism as a propaganda tool to get the Chinese populace on board with such an action.

Nationalism is a double-edged sword for the Chinese government. If you really go into the details here, you would know that its not only being used by the government, but its also forcing the government to certain actions. If the government fuels the fires of Nationalism, this fire can also get out of control, which is something the Chinese government can not allow.

&gt; It is in Germany's national interest to ensure a weak Europe

Wrong. It is in Germanys interest to ensure a strong EU, because we need the EU to be strong to be able to influence international politics. We also need the EU as a strong market for our products, after all.

We spend a lot of money on strengthening the EU and less-developed countries in the EU.

&gt; Whether it be the Prussians destroying the Austrians

They didn´t destroy the Austrians. On the contrary: After the victory over the Austrians, Bismark convinced the Prussian King NOT to destroy Austria and humiliate them. Prussia defeated Austria and replaced it as the dominant German power, but it did not destroy it.

&gt; Britain wasn't interested in leaving the EU until a referendum was issued

Britain has left the EU as a project long before this referendum ever happened. The EU was always seen as a ""continental"" project dominated by the French and German and Britain rejected the notion of an ever closer union long before the referendum happened.

&gt; Great Britain, an island that spread free trade across the entire globe, 'props up isolationism'? Jesus Christ.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splendid_isolation

The UK always was ""special"" compared with the Continental powers of Europe. This notion ultimately originated from the fact that the UK is an island that never was invaded by a continental power after the Normans. Britain is oriented towards the rest of the world and less so toward Europe. So ""spreading free trade across the globe"" (which really was just spreading British rule in form of the Empire) doesn´t prove me wrong.

850,"&gt; The fallacy you used is an argumentum ad populum (many people think so, so it must be true). Now you used an argumentum ad verecundiam (this is my experience, so it must be true for others)

I never did any such thing. You can stop masturbating over how many fallacies you know. I'm talking about my opinion, not making an argument.

&gt; Latinos in the US and refugees in Germany are hardly comparable due to different cultures, different countries, different migration sizes relatively speaking and different integration courses

They're very comparable due to the fact that there are negative elements within both populations, they are arriving in illegal fashion, and there is very little done to weed out undesirables.

The other stuff is irrelevant imo, other than the size difference being an indication of what is to come.

&gt; I did not say 'the only possible outcome of', like you made it seem like I did.

No, you just omitted any negative repeatedly, as if the change was only for the better. I assumed that you believed there was no negative because the alternative is that you are just ignoring my posts over and over while repeating that change is good.

&gt; In the end you made an assumption that those who have gone through the rigid process of legal migration are necessarily more inclined to work hard and be good citizens than those who didn't

It's necessarily so, given that they took the time to go through the legal process and respect the country's laws in the first place. That automatically makes them harder workers and better potential citizens.

&gt; even though illegal immigrants in the US have lower crime rates than legal immigrants from the same country of origin.

Haha, I would love to see the stats on that one. Do you know how much of our prison population consists of illegal immigrants? It's a big number.

&gt; What is wrong with refugee migration in Germany from Syria and Eritrea?

Nothing, if that's what Germans want.

&gt; Why do you think that in a hundred years from now their great-grandchildren won't be well-integrated?

Why do you think I believe they won't be integrated? It is funny to see you correct me over an assumption and then do the same.

892,"&gt;*""Philip K. Dick first came up with the idea for his novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' in 1962, when researching 'The Man in the High Castle' which deals with the Nazis conquering the planet in the 1940s. Dick had been granted access to archived World War II Gestapo documents in the University of California at Berkley, and had come across diaries written by S.S. men stationed in Poland, which he found almost unreadable in their casual cruelty and lack of human empathy. One sentence in particular troubled him: ""We are kept awake at night by the cries of starving children."" Dick was so horrified by this sentence that he reasoned there was obviously something wrong with the man who wrote it.* ***This led him to hypothesize that Nazism in general was a defective group mind, a mind so emotionally flawed that the word human could not be applied to them; their lack of empathy was so pronounced that Dick reasoned they couldn't be referred to as human beings, even though their outward appearance seemed to indicate that they were human.*** *The novel sprang from this. And, interestingly enough, it is now thought that some people are ""Occupational Psychopaths"" due to low-functioning amygdala, the fear centres of the brain's limbic system.""*

939,"&gt;and that was trivial compared to federalisation

Of course you can say it's trivial now, because we did it. People at the time were saying ""IT'S IMPOSSIBLE"" and screaming and shouting without substance, exactly as you are now, and yet we did it.

&gt;Euro only serves to make the boom-bust cycle more painful

Not really, the recession maybe lasted a year or 2 longer than America? Your entire statement here hinges on possibilities we can't measure, so it again, has no substance. Maybe individual currencies would Make things more flexible, or maybe it would result in massive overinflation in several EU countries, fucking up economies even worse, you can't say. What we can say, as a fact, is that it survived a recession with relative ease, and that is a success story whether you like it or not.

&gt; a fiscal union is not a real possibility,

Again, no real argument, you're just saying ""that's not possible"".

&gt;And also forces countries to give up control over foreign policy, and the decision to go to war. Complete non-starter

You mean like American states? Seriously, you have literally nothing of substance to say here. You're just saying ""na, that can't happen"". Do you not realise that? Come up with something worth anyone's time to read.

&gt;We already have that

Yes, that's the point. However, maintaining a strong, stable economic bond is necessary to make this concept more efficient. Best way to do that is more integration. Like you said, a fiscal policy union makes the Euro even more stable than it already is.#

&gt;Corporation tax is a pointless tax on productivity, which only hurts the economy

Tell that to America, with one of the highest corporation taxes in the western world, whilst also staying one of the richest countries. Like I said, integrating into a country with roughly equal power to America means we finally get a government with the balls to stand up to huge corporations.

&gt; But regardless, you'll never get tax harmonisation

Again with the ""nevers"". You don't need perfectly unified tax codes, just a base level set by the EU. You can allow countries the power to add tax on top of the base level, just like America does. That way countries that want to raise it can.

&gt;pushing for EU federalisation even though most people oppose it.

Again, [not true](https://i.imgur.com/Wg6MwYB.png?1). More people support federalisation than are against it.

&gt; The anti-EU sentiment in Eastern Europe

Doesn't exist in any significant numbers. Those countries are more reliant on the EU if anything, and they are also the ones who tend to support further integration

&gt;perceived domination countries like Germany and Belgium have over Europe

Germany sure because they have lots of people, but Belgium? Why Belgium? Countries like Romania have more relative power over EU parliament than Belgium, and I say relative because Romania actually proportionally has more seats than Belgium relative to population.

&gt;Surely the EU identity should come before the federalisation?

They should both come alongside each other, can't have one without the other. Also, many people in Europe already see themselves as European, an identity has already somewhat been formed, and it will only be strengthened.

&gt;If you think more people will ever identity is European, you are living in a bubble.

I think you're the one [living in a bubble](http://uk.businessinsider.com/british-dont-think-they-are-european-2016-4?r=US&amp;IR=T). You should really try researching these things.

&gt;Opportunity to change what? Not tax policy, not foreign policy, not the structure of the military

&gt;Catalan businessman Oriol Soler, a collaborator of Puigdemont and president of the media cooperative SOM —including the magazines ""Sápiens"" and ""Descobrir"", the ""Batabat"" production company, etc—, met on November 9th with Julian Assange, according to ""El País"". The meeting between this member of the inner circle of the _procés_ and the cyberactivist and founder of Wikileaks took place in the Ecuatorian embassy in London —where Assange has taken refuge for more than five years from US justice—, according to the same newspaper. The cyberactivist has a relevant role in the political conflict between Catalonia and Spain since last summer, openly and actively supporting the independence process on social networks. The meeting between Soler and Assange lasted about four hours, from 5pm to 9pm CET.
&gt;
&gt;Soler, who is in telephone contact with Puigdemont in Brussels, has denied to ""El País"" that the purpose of his meeting with Assange was to prepare a media strategy for the December 21st elections in Catalonia. The Catalan businessman, one of the campaign chiefs of _Junts pel Sí_, was accompanied by Arnau Grinyó, an expert on online marketing and communications, according to the newspaper. According to what Soler told ""El País"", during the meeting they shared «their vision of the present moment» with the founder of Wikileaks, as «we Catalans have also suffered electronic and physical espionage, censorship, judicial irregularities [...] like Julian Assange».

We're talking about archaeology, ethnicity, etc., not some half-cooked political ideology. (You might as well dismiss evolution because of the social darwinism of the Nazis.) 

The point being: I told him it was an alternate theory (actually, it was the original one from almost 1000 years ago), it's currently not accepted, but an archaeologist friend of mine actually thinks there might be merit in this idea.

That's all I said.

As for scientific acceptance: it took 70 years for people to accept the idea of continental drift... Science (even hard sciences) do change; just slowly.

Genetic analysis seems to be quite interesting, by the way. (I spent about an hour doing some literature search.)

&gt;Although this finding could result from chance, it is striking and suggests that there could have been genetic contact between the ancestors of the Madjars and Magyars, and thus that modern Hungarians may trace their ancestry to Central Asia, instead of the Eastern Uralic region as previously thought.

1173,"&gt; **EU commission continue to protect car manufacturers testing methods for emissions**

&gt; For years, people have been aware of the evasion of CO2 emissions by European car manufacturers - at least since media coverage across the globe covered 'Dieselgate', where Volkswagen was revealed to cheat on NOx emissions from their cars in the United States.

&gt; But it is far from just the emission of NOx, which the car giants crumble with. Thus, it is widely known in the industry that CO2 emissions on roads are higher than those reported by the manufacturers themselves on the basis of laboratory tests.

&gt; Therefore, several observers were disappointed when the European Commission presented a new proposal last week to cut CO2 emissions from the transport sector, but failed to change how European cars are being tested for CO2 emissions.

&gt; In the Ecological Council, Transport and Energy Worker Jeppe Juul is regretting the lack of ambitions in the field of testing:

&gt; ""Road testing is crucial to ensuring safety about actual emissions from passenger cars. Manipulation with testing gives a distorted picture, which can mean we think we've reduced CO2 emissions from cars more than we actually have, ""he says.

&gt; Dansk Energi, who is also pleased with the Commission's proposal, also wants consumers to get the emission figures as close to reality as possible.

&gt; ""You must be blind and deaf if you have not discovered that car manufacturers do a lot of kicks to get well in the test. There is too much interest in maintaining test environments that favor certain cars, ""says CEO of Dansk Energi Lars Aagaard, adding:

&gt; ""We should ensure comparable test conditions that provide consumers with transparency.""

&gt; The automotive industry is a 'curling industry'
&gt; When the EU fails to demand testing of cars' CO2 emissions by road, although technically possible, Jeppe Juul gets the car industry a 'curling industry in the EU'.

&gt; ""There is nothing technologically in the way of testing roads. It is about how scarce you will be to the automotive industry. But many will ease the life of the car industry, even if it goes beyond car owners and climate. It's simply a curling industry in the EU, ""he says.

&gt; If the EU introduced a 'real drive emission test', as it is called in Brussels, European car manufacturers will be busy meeting the discharge requirements, said Jeppe Juul.

&gt; However, the EU has dealt with the way in which CO2 emissions are measured in laboratories. From September next year, all new cars that are in trade must be tested for a new measurement method. It is based on WLTP (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure) instead of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), which has been used so far.

&gt; The change results in more realistic numbers of emissions, but there will still be loopholes for car manufacturers. Therefore, the actual emissions on the roads will remain higher than measured in the WLTP test.

&gt; As early as 2015, it was agreed in the EU that NOx emissions should be measured on roads through RDE (Real Driving Emissions) tests, but the proposal will not come into force until 2020. According to Technical Weekly, CO2 is also measured, but the figures are not published.

&gt; Large difference between laboratory and road
A new study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) shows that the deviation between laboratory numbers and actual emissions in 2016 was 42%.

&gt; Thus, a car abandoned to derive 100 grams of CO2 / km can effectively deduce 142 grams of CO2 / km. This means, in fact, that fuel consumption can be equivalent to higher than assumed if the deviation is 42 per cent.

&gt; The figure is based on comparisons of results from a variety of European studies of a total of almost one million cars.

&gt; However, the deviation is not a big problem in itself, explains Peter Mock, General Manager of ICCT Regional Office in Europe, to Technical Weekly Magazine from Norway.

&gt; ""I'm not so worried about the size of the deviation, whether it's 40 or 20 percent. The biggest danger is if it rises over time. If the deviation changes, any projection or plan will be worthless, ""says Peter Mock.",Jylland,/r/europe/comments/7cu8wz/eu_commission_continue_to_protect_car/dpsp3j1/,knud,1510647602

The only country that has actually decided where to bury it is Finland. Everywhere else the capsules are in a ""temporary"" storage facility. The capsules are safe enough that you can spend some time near them without fear. Going to an x-ray is most likely more dangerous, which is the reason why these temporary measures have been deemed adequate for now. In order for no radioactivity to reach the surface you need to bury the capsules around 50m underground. The finnish facility is 500m deep just to make sure IIRC.

1257,"&gt; American would prefers if Europe 

From a North American standpoint, not just the US, if you want whats best for the whole of the Western world and our ideology then yes we need Europe to get on board with a stronger military to project Western power, minus the whole colonial bit. 

You can show up with an aircraft carrier fleet like the famed 4th and 7th fleet and people know what time of day it is. At the same time, a tsunami can destroy part of Japan and you can use that same might to go from projecting power to using power for good. 

And I don't know any American that thinks the US isn't footing the majority of the bill when it comes to NATO regardless of politics which is pretty amazing being that Americans cant agree on anything.

&gt;It appears that the E.U. leaders are wise enough to leave the U.S. in the lead.

I think Leader of the Free World, #1 Country in the World.. these things need to end. I'd argue the German Chancellor became leader the moment Obama stepped down and may remain there. I'd also argue that Europe, specifically through NATO/EU that project of power needs to come from other Western countries. 

One reason why it's projected to let the US play military leader is due to the giant bill that comes with that via taxes that many European countries don't have to worry with. The other is simple things like trade, when people see you as warmongering and a threat, it doesn't sit well for major trade deals because people don't trust you. Europe for the most part doesn't suffer from this yet Western power is still projected through military and widely supported via US proxy, nearly everything military action the US does has support in Europe from one major power or another. 

**TL;DR:** Americans want Europe to fully stand on it's own feet even if NATO becomes obsolete. Europe I believe allows US to play military leader for the entire Western world with a lot of benefits for Europeans by standing back and providing support instead, but I think those days might change in the future and frankly I hope they do. It's a Win-Win as China would say.. except China wouldn't be part of the party.

1320,"Poland is an *inspiration* to the rest of Europe? In what way?

&gt;...and I'm sure Poles have no ill feelings towards british or anyone else.

That wasn't my point - Poles *in general* probably don't. However, there is a significant anti-Polish sentiment in Britain - because to a significant portion of Brits, Poles are viewed as opportunistic migrants who arrive to take British jobs and set up ethnic enclaves. 

I am damn sure that the ultranationalists who hate Muslims for being from a foreign culture and for trying to make their way in Poland would be outraged at the Brits for thinking the *exact same* of Poles in their own country. 

Similarly, Ukrainians have a complex relationship with OUN and Stepan Bandera - he is viewed by a significant portion of Ukrainians as a national icon. However, he and his Ukrainian Insurgent Army massacred between 60,000 and 100,000 Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia during the Second World War.

And I am damn sure that the ultranationalists who call for Jews an Muslims to be expelled and cleansed are outraged when groups in Ukraine celebrate of Bandera, because he did the exact same thing in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia. 

Nazi Germany's crimes against Poland are long and documented - the Slavic subhumans were no more worthy of holding on to their land and lives in ultranationalist German eyes than Muslims and Jews are in the eyes of ultranationalist identitarian Poles. It was not Polish land, it was German lebensraum waiting to be settled.

And yet, the ultranationalist identitarians in Poland freely call for access to their country to be denied to Muslims, and call for Jews to be expelled from their land. Despite the fact that they were the victims when their more powerful, more influential, more wealthy neighbors decided to adopt similarly ultranationalist, racially charged stances. 

The point I'm trying to make is that these morons are stupidly, almost irredeemably hypocritical - they will (and definitely do) bemoan Poles being ostracised and ethnically discriminated against in other countries, and bemoan the crimes done to their nation and their people by their neighbors pursuing racial and cultural homogeneity...but they will turn around and advocate for those exact same crimes to be done to the people they don't like. Namely, Jews and Muslims...and blacks, or coloreds, or anyone not white. Because they can do it to someone else. But when someone does it to them, they cry and rage.

If xenphobes want to build a world where they can freely persecute, expel and ultimately kill people they deem to be alien to their cultural and ethnic group, then they have to accept that they will have *all* those things done to them by other nations building similarly xenophobic, ultranationalist states. You live in the dog-eat-dog world you build - and it will end with you being swallowed up by your more powerful neighbors, as has happened to Poland in the past.

But ultranationalists never seem to realise that. And it is them that I'm amused at. They are morons and hateful imbeciles, no more than that. And ordinary Poles - the majority in that proud, historic country - deserve better than to have these mindless, drooling morons representing them on the world stage.

&gt;Am I wrong to assume they're against the religions, not the people?

1378,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Polish_sentiment#United_Kingdom

It's a fairly well-studied phenomenon. A large portion of the anti-E.U sentiment prior to Brexit was fuelled by resentment against Poles congregating in enclaves and taking British jobs on the cheap - resentment that had been building ever since Polish people first started moving to the United Kingdom en-masse in the late 90's.

I don't think it's a sentiment shared by all classes of Brits, or even by a majority of Brits, so it's very possible your experiences with them were completely accurate with regard to those individuals. But it is much more prevalent amongst the working class white voters in Britain. 

As for ultranationalism, okay - although really, you could just say the same about particularly ardent *nationalism* as well. Ukrainian nationalists celebrate Stepan Bandera - Polish nationalists hate him for killing and expelling Poles. But particularly ardent Polish nationalists (unless they're civic nationalists) are also likely to prefer an culturally and racially homogenous nation - so they shouldn't be complaining about Bandera killing and expelling Poles, because that was his aim too, at least in Volhynia and Galicia. But they do.

So I think there's rank hypocrisy there, whichever way you slice it. But I won't press it if you insist. ",Canada,/r/europe/comments/7cngxe/jews_out_of_poland_chants_heard_at_farright/dpsim2h/,FleetInBeing,1510635357

1501,"**During a meeting on Downing Street, the British Prime Minister will attract business representatives from across Europe. These, however, clearly have other priorities.**

Theresa May had called and more than a dozen representatives of leading business associations from all over Europe had come: on Monday they met the British Prime Minister in London to discuss the forthcoming brexite. The withdrawal of Britain from the European Union planned for March 2019 will cause growing concern on both sides of the English Channel, with new barriers to trade looming. At the same time, there is growing fear in the executive floors that the brexite will end up in chaos.

During the meeting, May reaffirmed her country's interest in free trade with the EU after brexit. Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Business Europe umbrella organisation, on the other hand, expressed ""extreme concern"" about the slow pace of exit negotiations between the UK and the EU. On the business side, the London meeting was seen as an attempt by the British to use European companies for their own interests - and to persuade them to put pressure on their home governments to be more willing to compromise with Britain. If this was the British's goal, it was certainly not achieved,""said a participant of the F. A. Z. following the round table.

At the same time, the British government's continued unrealistic view of the difficult exit negotiations was criticised:""They are still living in a parallel world"", it was said. Despite the great pressure of time and six rounds of negotiations to date, the Brexit talks between politicians have made little progress since the summer: the EU insists that sufficient progress must be made in the initial phase on three key exit issues. Britain, on the other hand, wants to talk about future trade relations at the same time.

**German industry calls for a transition phase of brexit**

Steffen Kampeter, the chief executive officer of the German employers' association BDA, supported the EU's line of negotiation:""An agreement on the three exit issues is a basic prerequisite for negotiations on relations after the Brexit,"" he said. The BDI supports the two-phase approach,""said Joachim Lang, the general manager of the Federation of German Industries (BDI). The two economic lobbyists from Berlin sat at the table in London on Monday.

The biggest brake block in the brexite negotiations is the issue of Britain's multi-billion dollar open commitments to the EU. The two other important exit issues are the consequences of brexite for Northern Ireland and the future status of EU citizens in the UK and Britain in the EU. Progress should be made before the EU summit in December, Lang said.

The head of the BDI also demanded a longer brexite transition phase for the period after 2019:""The two-year deadline set by May was"" not enough to create the necessary legal framework "", warned Lang. After the United States, Great Britain is the second largest buyer of German exports. Around 2500 German companies have branches on the island and employ more than 400,000 people there. The economy fears the reintroduction of tariffs and other trade barriers after brexite. In order to facilitate adjustment, the country must remain in the EU's internal market and the European Customs Union, at least temporarily, after 2019.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/7crimt/extremely_concerned_europes_economy_turns_may_down/dps31wx/,remiieddit,1510617674

&gt; First, the EU is not an instrument of German domination

Holy shit, my sides. The EEC is the continuation of Germany by other means, specifically, it is a continuation of the [Zollverein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zollverein). Germany is the strongest nation on the continent, economically speaking. The European Union has tied the European economies together, opened borders to trade, and inevitably allowed Germany to dominate the continent economically instead of militarily like their usual attempts.

&gt;  No. There is also the alternative to become sub-servant to China, which increasingly sees Europe as a little peninsula of Asia ripe for domination.

Thanks for bringing this up, because it just proves my point. China has always sought access to resources needed for its mass production that allows it to sell goods. This is why they develop the [Pakistan China economic corridor](https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-transforming-china-pakistan-economic-corridor/5612831), it allows China to have a land route to natural resources that doesn't have to pass through the Straits of Malacca,a strait owned by US allies; China also seeks to build their own canal in South America to counter the American-owned Panama Canal. China is seeking to use their industrial capacity to form trade routes all over the world and dominate countries via trade. Sound familiar? It should do, because that is exactly what Germany has done to the continent; they have used their size and industrial capacity to dominate the continent, and, in your words, sees 'Europe as a little peninsula ~~of Asia~~ ripe for domination.'

They don't have to pay if they never transfer it back. They use the money earned outside of the US to pay for everything they do outside the US. 

Apple even sell bonds in the US because they don't want to give the US taxpayer the money they owe them. Think about that, they have 261 billion in cash, but since most of that is stored outside of the US, they have to take a loan to continue their stock buyback program.

Don't confuse the national team with the quality of Serie A.
The results in the last ten years are only relevant to prove that the national team has got a better squad of players than ever in the last decade. All those players are very much top quality to be 'relevant' (i don't know what that means) and they have the quality to match the top sides in world football(look at Euro 2016). They needed a good manager like Conte.
That leads on to the quality of Serie A, which has improved a lot in the last 4 years. Some of the players mentioned are doing well in the champions league and UEFA coefficients prove that Serie A is doing well. They just over took Germany for 3rd place.

The bottom line is this team should very much have done well in the world cup but Ventura got his tactics wrong. Conte did better with WORST squad just two years ago.

How they played tonight was good actually. They dominated in all stats. But they fucked up last game (tactics) so Sweden could just defend all game.

&gt; The EEC is the continuation of Germany by other means, specifically, it is a continuation of the Zollverein. Germany is the strongest nation on the continent, economically speaking.

Nice conspiracy theory there. Of course, it ignores reality such as all conspiracy theories.

German economic dominance of the continent isn´t entirely Germanys doing. The Euro, which plays a key part in the economic development of the EU, was forced upon Germany by France - as a price for the reunification.

Of course, its not only France who did this. Its also Great Britain. You decided to de-industrialize yourself as well as to keep out of many parts of the EU. If you are not willing to lead (because you are still suffering delusions of grandeur from your lost empire) and France is unable to lead because of economic weakness, Germany has to fill the void or Europe is without any leadership. 

Germany is economically strongest yes, but its not stronger than France and Great Britain combined.

&gt; It should do, because that is exactly what Germany has done to the continent; they have used their size and industrial capacity to dominate the continent, and, in your words, sees 'Europe as a little peninsula of Asia ripe for domination.'

A stupid and wrong comparison, that you must have taken out of Daily Mail or the Sun.

The EU gives a huge amount of influence to smaller EU states. Germany can´t decide anything alone. If China on the other hand dominated the continent, they wouldn´t allow the locals much say in important matters.

German foreign policy is dominated by the believe in Liberalism, which favors trade and cooperation between democratic countries, while China is a one-party dictatorship.

1584,"&gt;  There's a huge difference in allowing participation and allowing hosting. If a country can't ensure the safety of participants, and allowing for standard moral behaviour, then it should not be a host.

Of course. That's very reasonable. But that's not just the opinion some had. Some players just oppose it because they don't like the country for reasons unrelated to the event:

&gt;England's top female player, Jovanka Houska, told chess.com: ""I definitely wouldn’t play in Saudi Arabia. I imagine the event will probably be very well run, so safety probably wouldn’t be an issue."" But she added: ""I really don’t feel comfortable visiting a country where I would need to be accompanied by a male guardian.

&gt;but they should not be hosting them if there are non-Islamic nations involve

That's ridiculous. Non-Muslims in Saudi Arabia are not illegal. 

&gt;Israel doesn't have the death penalty for being gay or an adulterer, it's not going to be arresting participants for blasphemy

Plenty of countries have laws for blasphemy. Russia, Singapore and others do. Saudi is not friendly to people who are openly gays and this goes for a multitude of countries (the claim that gays will get killed in Saudi just for being gay is unsubstantiated as well). 

If you're going to trim the countries that can host down to those that have fully adopted a Western way of life/laws, then you're not going to be left with a lot of countries and you're not bringing more countries together. You might as well apply this ridiculous standard to other sport events. Let's see the Olympics being played by Western countries, Japan and a few other nations.

1595,"&gt; Its still the Tories fault.

I never said it wasn't, I said their hand was forced.

&gt; Nice conspiracy theory there. Of course, it ignores reality such as all conspiracy theories.

Are you slightly mental? I don't mean a group of billionaires financing some German domination, I mean the EEC, like the Zollverein, is an economic union that benefits Germany and allows it to economically dominate the continent because of Germany's size and larger industrial capacity. This is not a conspiracy theory.

&gt; German economic dominance of the continent isn´t entirely Germanys doing. The Euro, which plays a key part in the economic development of the EU, was forced upon Germany by France - as a price for the reunification.

I never said it was entirely the doing of Germany, I said, the EEC was the 'continuation of Germany by other means'.

&gt; Of course, its not only France who did this. Its also Great Britain. You decided to de-industrialize yourself as well as to keep out of many parts of the EU. If you are not willing to lead (because you are still suffering delusions of grandeur from your lost empire) and France is unable to lead because of economic weakness, Germany has to fill the void or Europe is without any leadership.

You're arguing against things I am not even saying. Jesus Christ. You have proved my point, though, Germany, using the trading bloc as a political tool, has completely economically dominated the continent.

&gt; A stupid and wrong comparison, that you must have taken out of Daily Mail or the Sun.

wow le epic burn bro xD

&gt; If China on the other hand dominated the continent, they wouldn´t allow the locals much say in important matters.

You don't seem to understand my meaning of 'economic dominance'. China does not seek to politically intertwine nations and stop them from having freedom. China, like Germany, uses its large industrial capacity and stronger economy to completely economically dominate areas. Germany uses the EEC for such actions, China is using their [OBORI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Belt_One_Road_Initiative).

&gt; German foreign policy is dominated by the believe in Liberalism

Are you this naive? Here's a tip:

Russia's foreign policy is dominated by the belief in 'protecting Russian minorities'.

America's foreign policy is dominated by the belief in 'spreading democracy'. 

The British Empire's foreign policy was dominated by the belief in spreading civilisation to 'savage peoples'.

The USSR's foreign policy was dominated by the belief in 'liberating the workers from the evils of capitalism'.

Foreign policy is dominated by the national interest, it is in Germany's national interest to economically dominate the continent.

&gt; The ""4th Reich"" meme you are peddling makes much more sense than actually looking at reality, right?

The article you linked doesn't mention any ""active investigation"" taking place per se. Just that the foreign and defense ministers made a statement. 

If Russia orchestrated the Catalonia thing, why did they do it? The Reuters article says ""to divide the West and break its unity over economic sanctions imposed on Russia"" - but how does cause lead to effect in this case? Why would Catalonia's breaking away from Spain make Spain change its opinion on anti-Russian sanctions? And if I'm not mistaken, those economic sanctions are applied at the EU level - so if Spain were to suddenly change its stance on them, how could it unilaterally abrogate its obligation to enforce the EU sanctions (as an EU member) without facing repercussions from the rest of the EU? 

Here's another quote from the Reuters article:

&gt; Ramon Tremosa, the EU lawmaker for the PDeCat party of Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont, repeated on Monday that Russian interference had played no part in the referendum.

&gt; “Those that say Russia is helping Catalonia are those that have helped the Russian fleet in recent years, despite the EU’s boycott,” Tremosa tweeted, referring to Spanish media reports that Spain was allowing Russian warships to refuel at its ports.

1693,"&gt; Two women resident in Menorca, aged 72 and 59, were expelled from a Vueling flight from Barcelona to Menorca for speaking Catalan to the crew.

&gt; The captain forbade them to travel on the flight for refusing to answer an air hostess in Spanish

&gt; One of them, Margarita Camps Coll, 72 years old and resident in Ciutadella, intended to return to Menorca with the flight at 17.10 on Saturday afternoon. When she was already seated, one of the stewardesses asked her to place a sheet of paint in the upper compartment of the baggage, as it was located in one of the seats near the emergency exit. In Catalan, he replied that ""do not worry, I do not want it to wrinkle, and then I'll put it on"", to prevent other passengers from putting suitcases on it. However, as Margarita explains to the newspaper MENORCA , the stewardess replied that ""you have to speak to me in Spanish,"" to which she replied ""no.""

&gt; The facts did not go unnoticed by another passenger who was on the plane, a 59-year-old woman from Barcelona, ​​but resident in Es Castell, who went to defend Margarita, and claimed that ""on a flight between Barcelona and Menorca the stewardess must understand Catalan », says the neighbor of Ciutadella. Apparently everything was there, and shortly after another stewardess warned them that the captain wanted to talk to them outside the plane. ""There we met a couple from the Civil Guard, and the pilot told us, in a very arrogant tone, that we could not fly on that plane because we had disrespected one of the hostesses,"" says Margarita. ""We even asked to apologize to the stewardess, but the pilot told us there was no apology,"" he adds.

&gt; ""We feel humiliated because we can not speak in our language, we do not disrespect anyone,"" says Margarita. Afterwards, the Civil Guard returned their DNIs and went to the Vueling window in the El Prat airport terminal where they lodged a complaint. ""The girl who treated us was surprised by our case,"" she says.

&gt; The company, through Twitter, answers users who complain about these events that ""all aircraft crews based in Barcelona speak Catalan"" and that ""we are looking at what happened"".

1722,"Again, neutrality has nothing to do with getting invaded or not. Neutrality simply means that you're not taking sides, if two other nations have a conflict you're not going to join up with either side and you're treating both conflict sides equally. 

If a certain other nation wants to invade you and doesn't recognize your neutrality and independence, then the word ""neutrality"" means fuck all. That's why neutrality also won't make a strong military defence and other geopolitical measures obsolete (especially if the neutrality is just self-declared and not recognized by everyone). 


For a small nation like Switzerland in the middle of Europe surrounded by larger nations who have been at conflict with each other for centuries, a nation with different language regions which have always been the target of different foreign propaganda, remaining neutral was a key factor in remaining independent and united. We've learned early on what happens if everyone is trying to pull you on his side and gets you innvolved in conflicts that really shouldn't be your business, and Switzerland finally turning neutral was not just the wish of Switzerland but also the demand of all other European nations (Germany was afraid of Switzerland becoming a French satellite state, France was afraid of Switzerland becoming a German satellite state,....so everyone agreed that it is best if Switzerland is being recognized as a neutral nation, not incresing the consequences of potential future conflicts by taking sides and acting as a buffer). 

Today this neutrality might not be as important within the European theater anymore as it used to be in the past, but it still is important on a global level. We've learned that if we stay loyal to the principles of neutrality, and thus people would aknowledge our neutrality, we're not only not getting soaked into stupid conflicts of others but also receive a level of trust from all around the world we would never get if we were just seen as a puppet state of other European nations (and this has btw. not only been in the interest of Switzerland but also the world, it allowed Switzerland to become a negotiator in conflicts where both sides would refuse to even talk with each other, like between Cuba and the USA during the Cuba crisis, between North- and South-Korea, between Iran and the USA,....). 

Every country is in a unique situation and I can totally understand if a country like Estonia says it makes more sense to clearly side with the NATO or/and a potential EU army than declaring a neutrality that Russia won't recognize and respect anyways.

&gt;""Also, Turks call Hungary Macaristan... ...we are the only ones to do this, the rest name the country as Hungary...""

A bunch of languages refer to us by that name. To list a few, Slovakia, Czechia, Croatia, Slovenia - they all have names like Mad'arsko / Madarska or at least something along those lines.

As for the Turan stuff - I don't think any of that holds ground on a scientific level, it's widely rejected by academia, so I don't subscribe to it. I would go so far as to say that the average Hungarian hasn't even heard the word 'Turan'. I certainly haven't before the internet.

My only problem with the whole thing is that it feels super forced and often seems to be coming from a place of extreme nationalism. Time and time again I come across Turks online who are WAAY too aggresive about this perceived friendship, desperately wanting this connection to exist between our countries. This is not always the case, but I often see comments on various sites saying things like ""Hungarians are Turkic, we look the same, same language, same culture, fuck the West, fuck Europe, hajrá turan..."" (again, not necessarily in these exact words, but you get the gist). I wholeheartedly reject each of these ideas and so do most Hungarians, I think. This kinda shit just won't fly over here.

All I'm trying to say is, there is no reason that there can't be friendly relations between our countries, but it shouldn't be so because of some ""ancient bond"" that may or may not have existed thousands of years ago. By that logic we could be best buds with the Finns (and while I'm certainly not opposed to that idea, it's not the case at all).

1796,"&gt;They probably meant that the majority of the population was East Slavic-speaking.

As most Empires, you still had to be born within Lithuanian Proper - Core of Lithuania - Modern day Lithuania to be eligible for Grand Duke title.

&gt; I thought most of the **nobility was ethnically Lithuanian**, but that they **did use the Old Ruthenian language for official written** documents and stuff (before the Union of Krewo at least).

Those two are mutually exclusive. Most of Lithuanian nobility was in fact Lithuanian nobility, but after massive expansion into Ruthenian land via marriage/inheritance Ruthenian nobility joined Lithuanian nobility, most Lithuanian nobility that inherited Ruthenian lands would convert to local culture, calling them Ruthenians is half truth and half lie. It's medieval period and sticking modern definitions of nationality does not work on such time. There is a reason Polish-Lithuanian identity existed, but died soon after rise of nationalism.

And yes, Old Church Slavonic was used for a reason, Lithuanians were pagan people who just consolidated and began expansion into more ""civilized"" land, we didn't had writing script, we didn't had laws which is why we borrowed it from Kievan Rus', GDL is notoriously known from adapting for it's own sake be it culture, politics or warfare.

The state was neither Baltic nor Slavic, it was multi-ethnic state where nationality was not a thing because it was still medieval period. There is reason such words exist as Lithuanian Jew - Litvak, East Slavic Lithuanian - Litvin, Lithuanian Tatar - Lipka Tatar and Polish Lithuanian - well... [Polish-Lithuanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_identity), it's complicated.

1823,"&gt; This is not the first year of this March. 

Never said it was.

&gt; Since the very beginning it was organised by neo nazis and fascists (I mean ONR, MW and RN).

Indeed they were the ones who first started the Independence March, but since 2011 ""the Association of the Independent March"" was created (these groups are part of that association). Also, these groups are far-right, not neo-nazi or fascist. This is not my opinion, its just a fact. Its illegal to promote fascism and nazizm in Poland, These groups have existed for many years now, not the current government, not the previous ones, not the police and not the courts have stated they were fascists/nazis. 

&gt; Someone goes there, knows who and what will shout loud. Don't want to support them? Don't support the March.

BS, the only thing people that went there were supporting was: ""celebration of independence, support of Polish traditions and patriotism"", that is the only thing the march represented. Sadly, in a group of 60k you will have a handful of idiots, but that does not represent the whole group in any way.

&gt; Sorry, but it's bullshit what you're saying here.

It's all systemic with loads of nuances. But the OP was about the fate of Warsaw and the post I replied to was about Polish suffering to the Soviets ploy. 

Having said that, I'm inclined to say, I don't fully agree with certain things you're saying. First off, yes Poland annexed parts of Czechoslovakia. But the Soviets, who admittedly made some threats to the Poles and mobilised some forces, to my knowledge didn't threaten Hitler(but I'll gladly be corrected if you can find a source for that, the sources I know just talk about the Polish-Soviet relationship). Ofcourse we know now that the Soviets weren't even capable of beating the Finnish let alone the Poles or Germans at that time. Odds are, they knew that as well. 

Besides that, if we talk about resistance, the Soviets didn't really care about resisting Hitler. Their opposition to the Czechoslovakian annexation had more to do with the Poles. As illustrated in the Molentov-Ribbentrop Pact that was signed merely a year later. Peace between the Nazi's and the Soviets and Poland that was divided between them. Hardly opposition. 

Also, yes the French and British could have done more during the phoney war of 1939 (as it had been the perfect time to quickly end the war), but it's too easy to say they didn't try to stop the war. They just went about it in the most boneheaded style in history, aka apeasement. Add to that, that the Poles did fight for their homeland, while the Soviets helped crush them. The Poles lost about 66k killed and 134k men wounded. Hardly not resisting. 

The thing is, the whole war was, most like any war, about shitty countries, trying to gain an advantage over other countries by screwing them over with constantly switching allegiances.

It's just classic far right populism, pretending the country is under siege and how all the good patriotic Poles need to rally around to defend it to keep Poland pure.

 Some people just can never be convinced. I've met several types of far righters. Some just deny being far right, because as far as they are concerned, if you're not literally a Nazi, going around killing jews, you can't be a far right extremist. Others admit to being far right, but they think that being far right is okay and that they shouldn't be compared to Nazis just because they were also far right. Then there's those far righters that actually think they should strive to be like the Nazis, the ones that deny the Holocaust or think jews deserved it. The latter are the best ones IMO, at least they are honest with themselves and everyone else. The first two categories will just go along with populist far right politicians, accepting more and more human rights violations and eventually the dismantling of democracy (for the good of the nation of course), justifying or denying their actions until the very end, until after all is said and done and countless are left suffering, they can say that they didn't know and that they always supported them for good reasons.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/7cl0ub/polish_leaders_condemn_nationalist_march/dpraqof/,Frostxtq,1510589736

2035,"&gt; why do some people feel the need to bring up the notion of 'false claims' when there is the slightest mention of sexual violence against women, but they never seem to bring it up in respect of any other sort of crime e.g. murder, GBH, theft or sexual violence against men?

Probably because it is way harder to make a case from a false claim about a murder or GBH and sexual (or domestic) violence against men is a whole different box of worms.

The issue is that most sexual violence happens in private situations between two people and no witnesses. Therefore it is extremely difficult to prove and proof is imperative to convict. The only physical evidence you might have are traces on the victims body and those will be gone after a while so the victim has to report within a short time frame after it happened. This together with the shame they feel and the fear they have over the examinations (doesn't matter if those are right or not) are enough to make people shy away from it.

It is sad enough that we need to raise doubts about such accusations because of some trying to build a case on false accusations. It is sad as well that often times false accusations are enough to make sure the accused is de facto regarded as guilty by most people no matter if he is actually convicted, or fully rehabilitated (legally). As soon as the case looked solid enough that it went to court it is basically guaranteed that you will lose your job and a big chunk of your social life as well.

In that it is similar to pedophilia. The same or even more stigmata come with someone accusing you of that.

Both are of course disgusting crimes but it is no less disgusting to lay a false claim but the power you have about someone by accusing them and marking them guilty in the public eye even if they aren't is a vile thing. If you beat someone bloody people might fear you. If someone claimed you raped, they are disgusted of you. The public accepts that you can rehabilitate from robbery, criminal assault or fraud, even murder in some cases. But sexual violence will be with you for life. And that is why false accusations of this are so much worse and so much more often brought up.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7cmknz/sexual_harassment_a_new_obsession_leftists_gone/dpr45fv/,Nemo_Barbarossa,1510581912

A guy from across the street can't come to my house unless I invite him. He will sit where I tell him, he will eat what I serve, and he will leave when I ask him. Nobody will accuse me of being a racist ot a nazi because I set the rues in my home.

2110,"Disclaimer: I'm just talking about history, you can call whatever sport you want, whatever you want. Personally I change what I say depending on the person I speak to, eg. to a GAA fan I'll say soccer, and call the GAA variant football, if it's a soccer fan I'll call that football and refer to the GAA variant as ""Gaelic"". Simple and pleases everyone. 

The main codes of Football:
Gaelic Football  
Association Football  
Rugby Football Union  
Rugby Football League  
Australian Rules Football  
International Rules Football  
Canadian Football  
American Football  

Football was used as a catchall term to denote it was a sport played on foot, not horseback. Rules varied from town to town, let alone county to county and country to country. 

Only in the 1860s were there movements towards centralising the rules - at which point disagreements arose and there was the Association - Rugby split, GAA developed on its own, then later the Rugby Union and Rugby League split while concurrently the style of rugby played in North America began to deviate towards American and Canadian football. 

&gt;There are also so many different types that you're sure to either get somebody being pedantic about it (Like me?) or somebody offended that you forgot about one of the many football games that exist even in just England.

Here's an interesting solution: In Australia Rugby League is called footie, Rugby Union is called footie, Australian Rules is called footie and soccer is called footie. No one gives a fuck. 

It is funny how all the (at least major) forms of football originated in the English speaking world. This means we're more exposed to the expanded use of football in our language and cultures - eg. in rugby union/league, AFL and GAA you will regularly hear people call players ""footballers"", ""he's a good footballer"", not as common but ""rugby football"" or just ""football"" instead of ""rugby ball"".

So because of that exposure and the history of the English speaking world's relationship with the various codes of Football, I find it's non English speakers that are the most militant and vehement in calling Association Football the only form of 'Football' - because 1) they don't have the history and exposure, Association Football was first on the scene and exploded in popularity world wide, went professional early and was (and still is) the easiest to pick up and play and 2) in their respective languages there is no alternate. You cannot call rugby ""Rugby Fußball"" in German, it sounds retarded and contradictory, ergo it must be the same in English. 

Rugby is arguably the second most popular form of 'football' on the international stage and has distanced itself from the use of 'football' in the last 20 years. Older rugby clubs still sport ""FC"", mid-old rugby clubs use ""RFC"" and newer clubs have dropped the 'football' altogether, for just ""RC"" - especially in new markets.

&gt;So yeah. Association Football is where we got the term ""Soccer"" from.

Soccer came from the slang of the 19th Century, shortening words and putting -er at the end. You can't do it with Association, so it became ""Asocc"" and then drop the A add the -er - ""Soccer"". They did the same with rugby and called it ""rugger"".

Side story North American rugby fans call the rugby players ""ruggers"" for some bizarre reason (over at /r/rugbyunion we don't mind the sport being called rugger, but once you call a player ""a rugger"" you'll not have a good time). 

tl;dr, I just find the history interesting, how the use has developed and changed in English and how it hasn't really spread to other languages contributing to this 'football vs soccer' gap.

2120,"You are basically supporting what I said earlier. You are absolutely correct that the wish of many people to be responsible parents able to provide for their children (which implies stable job, home, a partner etc., as you said) is what's delaying having children until late 20's/early 30's in most people in the developed world. And that's OK, because that means our low fertility rates are not some kind of a suicide wish of our culture, but simply a result of various socio-economic pressures we can deal with.

I firmly believe, also based on my experience, that if young couples were helped to achieve economic stability sooner, they'd have more children eventually. Currently, young couples are being squeezed by debt, shit jobs, long working hours, expensive housing and other factors that leave too little time and money to start a family. But most people I know do want to have children, and not just one. Most people want two. If they are given the opportunity, they will.

Now, we should leverage the coming automation and advances in medical science (especially the treatment of ageing) to help couples get more stability, economic safety and free time (e.g. by reducing working hours; possible if automation is properly used to benefit the people and not the top 1%), they will have larger families. Eventually, the population will become stable.

If, however, some idiots in government choose to continue letting the corporations to drive most people out of their jobs, squeeze them with insane home prices and extortionist rents, long working hours and then import Third World immigrants to do the shit jobs that can't be automated even cheaper, then you can bet the birth rates will continue to fall and our culture will eventually break down completely due to social and ethnic conflicts.

As someone involved with historical reenactment - these people flock to us, not the other way around. And obviously it is truthful to say our group largely right-leaning. We like history and weapons, and that is enough to be clasiffied as conservative in Anglosaxon media.

But if anything, begrudging apathy towards group like Młodzież Wszechpolska (translated as All Polish Youth in article) or NOP has turned into slowly growing antipathy.  
I've been contacted by even more far-right organizations in the past (Narodowe Odrodzenie Polski - Nationalistic Renaissance of Poland), as were other groups from my region - and although their proposal was sensible, it seems none of the reenactors felt comfortable working with them even in limited educational capacity (whereas we gladly worked with institutionalized youth).

I understand the allure of propping up the strawman of right wing explosion, that it can electrify and mobilize people. But I also want to remind that putting people on the defensive - causes them to entrench their thinking against the accuser. 

I like these marches. I like shooting guns. I love history and spreading it. I'm still designated as a ""lewak"" (leftist) by right-wing, and their sneering caused me to embrace that patch as a Fuck You to them.

2209,"&gt; They are attempting to deconstruct the Polish national identity to make them into a weak lot of consumers like Western Europeans who have completely lost their national identities.

What a joke. How have we lost our national identities? I think westerners still feel pretty proud and strongly connected with their country, we just don't go overboard with the ethno-state bullshit, or comparing homosexuals with paedophiles (saw a pic of people holding a banner with gays and pedos crossed out in the big thread, can't find it now).

With the former we have bad experiences (you'd expect the Poles to know out of all people) and with the latter we care about treating people equally, even a small minority that was historically treated like garbage, and still treated like garbage in most of the world. That doesn't make us a nation of ""weak consumers"" just because we view things differently, in fact in my eyes that makes us strong.

I'm not buying that ""these are just good Christian patriots who had no idea who the organizers are"". This is not the first event of this kind, the organizers are well known by the public (National Movement, National Radical Camp, All-Poland Youth). If you're going to the March, you are at least neutral towards these organizations. 

If you consider yourself a patriot and want to celebrate the Independence Day, you go to Plac Piłsudskiego at noon for the official celebrations, not join far-right politicians and football hooligans. Simple as that.

This is a over-simplification so extreme it borders on the ridiculousness, as it seems to be saying that left-wing people's goal is revolution for the sake of it.

My PoV: the left is in favor of unions, just not of ruinous ones. 

Example: free movement of people is usually a nice thing; among other things, it allows people to escape their country if it becomes a hellhole. EU has allowed that in Europe, so it's usually seen as a good thing.

However, free movement of _capital_ (incl. manufactured products) is usually seen as a bad thing, because it can actually undermine your nice and shiny social policies: you may enforce very high wages and labor rights, but your country goes bankrupt because people start buying much cheaper products from countries without such standards. The EU has often encouraged that, but left-wing associations have been critical of that whenever possible (e.g. European constitution, TTIP, CETA, etc.)",,/r/europe/comments/7cm3nw/national_selfdetermination_is_overrated/dpqxgf5/,primarydisney,1510567784

2264,"Shitty journalism and lies:

&gt; Polish government leaders condemned two self-described radical nationalist groups seeking an ethnically and religiously pure country that organized an Independence Day event attracting tens of thousands of people.
Wrong, 

Glinski condemned (rightfully so) a couple inappropriate banners that were at the March, later on he called the whole event a ""beautiful national March"". He did not condemn the March or the organizers (who by the way also condemned those couple banners).

&gt; The National Radical Camp and the All Polish Youth—two nativist political movements both named after Polish anti-Semitic fascist leagues from the 1920s and 1930s—organized Saturday’s march to mark the 99th anniversary of the country’s independence.

Not precise. The March was organised by the ""Association of Independence March"" which indeed they are part of, but not only them.

&gt; Many of the attendees—estimated at 60,000 by the police—said they were not members of those organizations, but saw nothing wrong with celebrating their country’s 1918 statehood marching alongside them.

""Many"" doesnt even cover it. There were 60 thousand people. When these two groups organize their own far right marches, they are lucky if a couple hundred people show up.

&gt; The march underscores how a growing section of Polish youth are turning rightward.

Sure, but not far-right. There is nothing wrong with people being right wing.

&gt; The size of the march raised questions in the Polish press over the degree to which the marchers subscribed to the two groups’ beliefs, or whether they were simply willing to overlook them as they joined the biggest event in the capita on Saturday.

This isnt even a question, again 60 at Independence March vs a couple hundred (at best) at far right marches.

&gt; Interior Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Sunday he didn’t see any racist signs or symbols at the march.

Not surprising, there were literally a handful of these signs among 60 thousand people.

&gt; The largely young crowd on Saturday shot off Roman candles and many chanted “fatherland,” behind banners such as “Clean Blood” or “Europe Will Be White or Deserted.”

They chanted ""God, Honor, Homeland"" - Polands Army official motto, first used during WWII when Poland fought against nazis. Thats an extreme generalization - there were literally a couple of these banners (condemned by the organizers), that does not represent 60 thousand people in any way.

&gt; Officials in the Warsaw city government said they thought the march reflected poorly on Poland,

Not surprising, they (PO politicians) are against it politically. When PO was in power every year there were problems with the March - police brutality, provocations, etc.

&gt; “It’s getting more and more vicious,” said Jakub Skrzypek,

That interesting since, for the 3rd year straight (since PO left power) it has been peaceful without any incidents, its getting safer/calmer - not more vicious.

&gt; Richard Spencer, an American until recently banned from 26 European countries who wants to create a country for white people in North America, was invited. The Polish government asked him to stay home, and he didn’t turn up.

Another lie. He was not invited to the Independence March, he was invited by another group (Kongres Narodowo Spoleczny) to speak at their meeting a day before the March, this group has nothing to do with organizing the Independence March.

&gt; Some Poles on Facebook and Twitter said they were staying away from the city center on Saturday to avoid potential violence. Three previous years’ marches devolved into tear-gas-clouded scuffles with police.

It was peaceful - they had nothing to fear. BS, the last three years have been the most peaceful and the police reported no serious incidents. AFAIK there were no scuffles and tear gas was not used - a source for this claim would be nice.

&gt; Police detained at least 45 people on Saturday.

2270,"&gt; How do you convince the public and the government to increase your wage

Let's just talk about art for a moment and leave science/research off the table, because it's going to be easier to find funding for hard research.

You write a grant application, you develop a project plan for your art museum/concert series, you apply to the ton of existing grant and funding projects for both the arts and sciences out there, you do research and apply for the multitude of scholarships from both the private sector and public sources, as well as for funding support.  The list goes on, and the money is there.  It's just not there for people who don't actively go looking for it.  Just like any small businessperson needs to learn stuff like accounting, marketing, sales, strategy, HR, etc. that's probably not directly relevant to the work they do, an artist has to learn all the above.

And while I refuse to even consider whether there's any ""objective"" way to determine whether one art project is more worthwhile than another one, there's always going to be some that don't get funded, no matter how much you may like them, or how much artistic merit you feel they may hold.  And then it just becomes a function of how much work the artist (and their supporters!) put into ""selling"" the product to people with funding....just like anyone in any other line of work looking for a raise.

Even someone like Christoph Marthaler, whose audience numbers went down drastically in Zurich during part of his career because his production style was too ""avant-garde"" for the general public understood this and has managed to cling on.

2274,"Yes, it would. Bear in mind, though, that that is not (for most) the reason behind this. Since the referendum, May's govt. has had a very nasty tendency to try and make decisions *without* parliament. They didn't want to give parliament any vote at all (but lost a court case) and now are trying to engineer things so that parliament are forced to wave it through, while allowing ministers to make enormously important decisions unilaterally by using what have been dubbed 'Henry VIII powers' - old laws (from 1539) allowing the government (monarch) to usurp parliament. Basically, they get the Queen to put stuff into law without asking her MPs first.

So for many, in parliament and out, it really is a matter of principle. They don't want to veto a deal, but they want the *ability* to veto a deal. Parliament is the voice of the people and **must** have the final say, **not** the government. Brexit is (in my view) the worst political disaster for the UK since the Suez Crisis, possibly worse. But I am not alone in thinking that if the government were to have won their court case, or in some other way set a precedent making it acceptable to usurp the authority of parliament, that is far, far worse and I would rather have the hardest of hard Brexits than that.

Brexit is a once-in-a-century disaster. The loss of parliamentary authority would be a once-in-a-millenium disaster and open the door to dictatorship. Not now and likely not in our lifetimes - but this is a door we closed 500 years ago. We avoided it (in principle) when the government lost their court case.

This is a fast estimate based on this years growth, taking into account the average age of death of those born ~1980 of 71 (1980+71 = 2051). 2051-2017=34. 71-34 = 37 years. I've been generous and included population up till 39 years old.  
  
The report that was made summed it to ~30% if you account for several more factors but I'm not at work right now to share it so this gross estimate will have to do.

2307,"&gt; The Treaty of Lausanne (French: Traité de Lausanne) was a peace treaty signed in Palais de Rumine,[1] [2] Lausanne, Switzerland, on 24 July 1923. It officially settled the conflict that had originally existed between the Ottoman Empire and the Allied French Republic, British Empire, Kingdom of Italy, Empire of Japan, Kingdom of Greece, and the Kingdom of Romania since the onset of World War I.[3] The original text of the treaty is in French.[3] **It was the result of a second attempt at peace after the failed Treaty of Sèvres**, which was signed by all previous parties, except the Kingdom of Greece, but later rejected by the Turkish national movement who fought against the previous terms and significant loss of territory. **The Treaty of Lausanne ended the conflict and defined the borders of the modern Turkish Republic**. In the treaty, Turkey gave up all claims to the remainder of the Ottoman Empire and in return **the Allies recognized Turkish sovereignty within its new borders**.[3]

2325,"Hi man! 

If you genuinely want the sources for that, I can try to digg them up when I get home today. 

These are of course not the officially issued statistics from the homepage of the Swedish migration board. Instead the data comes from aggregated official statistics that I think were put together by the economist Jan Tullberg and/or Jan Ekberg. 

They Government have made it hard/impossible on purpose for normal people to get access to proper statistics by simply not organizing them. It's the best trick ever.

For example, in order to arrive at the conclusion that the unaccompanied refugee children (as they are called officially) cost close to 170 000SEK/year in during the initial phase, you have to add up ALL of the cost posts in a +100 pages document which is hard to read even if you are used to academics.

Once they are given residency, the state stops keeping track of what they cost, forcing you to individually keep track of the economy of the 291 Swedish municipalities and aggregate the data yourself. 
If you then try to publish your findings you will most likely run in to severe resistance, even if you are a famous or respected person. 

So regarding the demographics, the Government changed the definition of ""immigrant"" and ""immigrant back ground"" about 10 years ago. 
All people who were half Swedish got moved from ""Foreign background"" into the category ""Swedish background"". 

This meant that a lot of second generation immigrants who marry someone from their home country to have kids with, have their kids being counted as half Swedish among some other problems.

But these economists have kept track on the demographics and were able to reverse the corrupted data which I think is to be found in one of their online presentations. If you really are interested in the source I will find it for you.

Swedes get to be much older than every single major immigrant group that has come here. The immigrants who come here are also generally speaking MUCH younger than the Swedish national average age. Lastly they have way more kids, so that's why there is a huge difference between the ratio of young immigrants vs older immigrants and the Swedes.

I can also bring you sources that show which Swedish municipalities that already have a immigrant majority (Like Södertälje and Botkyrka) and the projection that Swedes will be a minority before 2040. They are already halfway there.

If I was able to take what I have written and send it back 15 years in time to myself, I would not believe a single word and probably believe myself to be a paranoid white supremacist. 

But when I go to places like Botkyrka or Tensta and other places that have 80%-100% immigrants, it is very clear that a huge demographic shift already has taken place.

If you fund a company with £100m of shares you'll pay taxes on all of your profits.

Fund it with £90m of debt - issued by the same people - and £10m of shares and pay half your profit in interest and you'll only pay tax on the other half.

This also makes companies less stable.

There's a solution to both: stop trying to tax profit, and tax the dividend and interest payments companies make instead, in the jurisdiction where the recipient lives, using the tax rates and bands used for income tax so that richer people pay more.

'Profit made in country x' is never going to be well enough defined to work well, without double taxing, with all the different allowances different governments want and so on.

I agree that obviously the previous treaties which you mentioned existed and bilaterally set those borders but it wasn't until the Lausanne treaty which the allied powers relinquished the Sevres Treaty, in part because of the other treaties you mentioned. It's at this point which internationally the borders are agreed and set. Legal nuances exist and all, but anyway.

Take into account the 'myth' comes from Ottoman times, hence the possible confusion. To add to the confusion, Abkhazia was part of Georgia the whole period (same dynasty).

On your second statement, I don't agree - Georgians look very different from Azeris or Armenians. It might be that East Georgians are more swarthy (the weather can be a factor) but for sure West Georgians look very very similar to Circassians (when I see Abkhazians I see Georgians to be honest.

2407,"&gt;On the side note, if the Old Town was demolished ... what was the point of rebuilding new 'Old Town' ? We have literally constructed a make-believe just to feel better ? 'Oh, look, that is how beautiful Warsaw was'.

Well, I would argue that a building is more than the sum of the stones that hold it up. After all, buildings are often replaced bit by bit through repairs and modifications. What remains is the central design - the spirit of the building. Now is there a certain sense of artificiality in rebuilding a structure that was destroyed? Perhaps. But what of it. 

Let me give you another example, the beautiful Old Bridge in Mostar, Bosnia was destroyed [when it was shelled by Croatofascists during the civil war.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5tTbXAQ4uA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=0m49s) Now should we have said oh well, what done is done and this beautiful centuries old bridge should be consigned to history books? In reality the answer was no and the bridge was rebuilt using traditional material [preserving the iconic look of the town.](http://i.imgur.com/gFeusxm.jpg) Likewise when I visited Warsaw I greatly enjoyed visiting the Old Town, even though I knew that the actual building were recently rebuilt. To me it didn't matter in the least. If anything I enjoyed the beauty of the scene even more knowing that it was recovered from the horrific cataclysm that utterly ravaged the city.

2461,"&gt; the same Soviets handed Vilnius over to Lithuania once a peace Treaty was signed.

Exactly. Which was a tactical move on their side. Look what was happening in Polish-Soviet war at that moment.

That's the point here - neither side treated other one as a partner; both fought from the beginning. Poles didn't trust Lithuanians, because you cooperated first with Germans, and second with Soviets. Lithuanians didn't trust Poles e.g. because of coup mentioned above. 

Both sides are at fault here.

&gt; The international community was on our side. 

It was LN, who eventually stopped Lithuanian-Żeligowski fighting. 

&gt; The same way we are handling the Russians, Belarusians and Poles living in Lithuania today.

Polish minority would be bigger and stronger (estimate 15-20% of total, if we ""merge"" Kaunas' borders with Central Lithuania) - notice that elites, especially from Vilnius itself, generally moved to Poland after 1945. Of course some of them would probably move anyway, but not that many (even nationalist Lithuania would be much better place to live than Soviet Union; it was actually decent during 1939-40 short Lithuanian pre-Soviet rule, although Polish-Lithuanian relations have warmed up a little during a year before). Still, it would probably make Lithuania less homogenous, and Vilnius might (probably would) stay minority-Lithuanian.",Pommerellen-Pòmòrskô-Pomorze,/r/europe/comments/7c9dkb/todays_farright_march_in_warsaw_on_polish/dpqstmx/,pothkan,1510556104

The president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, was ""impressed"" by the independence demonstration on Saturday in Barcelona and asked the European Union (EU) to listen to ""the voice of the people of Catalonia.""

""Europe has to open its ears, the EC, the EU in Brussels can not continue to act automatically, favoring the interests of elites, turning their backs on the voice of the people,"" said the leader of the Bolivarian revolution during his program Sunday.

Surrounded by his staff, Maduro praised the ""creativity"" of demonstrations of the Catalan separatism as held on Saturday, which called for the release of public offices of the Generalitat destitute and imprisoned, and said that ""the people must be heard , it is not necessary to fall to blows like it did (Mariano) Rajoy "", president of the Spanish Government.

""Impressive, it is impossible not to comment on it (...) Impressive the mobilization of the people of Catalonia, impressive. Our greeting to the people of Catalonia. Our respect, our admiration for the people of Catalonia, impressive images, creativity, ""said the head of the Venezuelan State.

For Maduro, the secessionist movement in Catalonia is ""more a social force than a force of another type, plus a rejection of neoliberalism and the looting that Spain is doing that another issue.""

The Chavista leader made these comments at the beginning of his program 'Sundays with Maduro', which on this occasion was dedicated to the International Book Fair that is held these days in Caracas.

At the beginning of the program, Maduro praised the Bolshevik Revolution - of which this year marked one hundred years - and his legacy and pleaded for a ""cultural revolution in all aspects"" for Venezuela, at the same time he quoted Chinese Grand Helmsman Mao Zedong.

2527,"&gt;&gt; an occupation and an illegal (a la Crimea) annexation for it to change hands
&gt;
&gt;I don't think that comparison is viable. It was a period of multi-sided war, where Vilnius were under threat of Soviets (and actually conquered by them, twice). 

Funny enough the same Soviets handed Vilnius over to Lithuania once a peace Treaty was signed. Instead of ending the bloodshed Poland attacked and illegally annexed Vilnius. The international community was on our side. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Wars_of_Independence war against Poland) 

&gt;On the other hand, it would be actually an interesting piece of alternative history - how would Lithuania handle a significant and influential Polish minority, if Vilnius and area were included into its' borders?

The same way we are handling the Russians, Belarusians and Poles living in Lithuania today. They were part of the government in the last coalition. They were part of the ruling coalition in the city council of Vilnius during the last term. 

&gt;&gt; Switzerland, Belgium got along nicely even though they're both split between 3 languages.
&gt;
&gt;Problem here is, that Lithuanian elites didn't promise multi-language country, but Lithuanian-first language policy. Piłsudski actually tried a proposal of ""cantonal"" Lithuania (covering also modern Belarus). There was no will of any cooperation on Kaunas' side. 

You see, it's easier to forcibly destroy the language and traditions of a minority that's 5% of your country than the one that's 15-20% or even close to the majority in your capital region. Especially when there's a very aggressive state right next door that just wants to hear something that would let them attack under the pretext of 'protecting the minority rights'. 

And Poland not only did not promise to protect the minorities but also actively tried to destroy the minorities: 

'Linguistic assimilation was considered by National Democrats to be a major factor for ""unifying the state."" For example, Grabski as Polish Minister for Religion and Public Education in 1923 and 1925–1926, wrote that ""Poland may be preserved only as a state of Polish people.

2596,"&gt;  Polish government leaders condemned two self-described radical nationalist groups seeking an ethnically and religiously pure country that organized an Independence Day event attracting tens of thousands of people.
&gt; 
&gt; “We do not approve of support in the public sphere for an ethnic national community, we support the idea of a nation rooted in culture,” Piotr Glinski, the country’s deputy prime minister said on Sunday, a day after the country’s largest national independence celebration attracted far-right movements from at least six other European states.
&gt; 
&gt; The National Radical Camp and the All Polish Youth—two nativist political movements both named after Polish anti-Semitic fascist leagues from the 1920s and 1930s—organized Saturday’s march to mark the 99th anniversary of the country’s independence. Many of the attendees—estimated at 60,000 by the police—said they were not members of those organizations, but saw nothing wrong with celebrating their country’s 1918 statehood marching alongside them.
&gt; 
&gt; The march underscores how a growing section of Polish youth are turning rightward. The National Radical Camp seeks an ethnically pure Poland, and has focused rhetoric against Jews and Muslims, both groups representing less than 1% of the country’s population.
&gt; 
&gt; The National Radical Camp has said it wants an authoritarian, Catholic Poland, and its members have burned Jews in effigy.
&gt; 
&gt; The size of the march raised questions in the Polish press over the degree to which the marchers subscribed to the two groups’ beliefs, or whether they were simply willing to overlook them as they joined the biggest event in the capita on Saturday.
&gt; 
&gt; Although the two groups organized the march, some government leaders described them as a fringe within the crowd. Interior Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Sunday he didn’t see any racist signs or symbols at the march.
&gt; 
&gt; The largely young crowd on Saturday shot off Roman candles and many chanted “fatherland,” behind banners such as “Clean Blood” or “Europe Will Be White or Deserted.” Some marchers said they had flown in from Hungary, Slovakia and Spain, and waved flags and symbols that those countries used during their wartime collaboration with Nazi Germany.
&gt; 
&gt; “There are, of course, nationalists and fascists at this march,” said Mateusz, a 27-year-old wrapped in a Polish flag, “I’m fine with it. I’m just happy to be here.”
&gt; 
&gt; Officials in the Warsaw city government said they thought the march reflected poorly on Poland, but they said they had no choice but to approve the demonstration, as it fulfilled the legal requirements and qualified as a celebration of Polish history. “This is not the type of event I would take my children to,” said Agnieszka Kłąb, spokesperson for the Warsaw City Council.
&gt; 
&gt; The National Radical Camp has been holding Independence Day marches since 2009. Until several years ago, it struggled to attract more than a few hundred people. In the past three years, it has become one of the largest nationalist marches of its kind anywhere in Europe. Saturday’s was about the same as the previous years, but drew in a greater number of far-right groups from neighboring countries.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s getting more and more vicious,” said Jakub Skrzypek, 25, one of about a dozen counterprotesters standing behind a banner that read “We Are Polish Jews” and surrounded by police. “We are really in fear.”
&gt; 
&gt; The National Radical Camp’s followers argue, on their social-media accounts and in their literature, that the influx of Syrian refugees into Europe is part of a conspiracy driven by Jewish financiers, who are working with Communists in the European Union to bring Muslims into Europe, and with them, Shariah law and homosexuality.
&gt; 
&gt; The group has regularly held events to mark a 1936 pogrom against Jews. Its symbols were displayed on a banner that appeared over a Warsaw bridge, reading: “Pray for Islamic Holocaust.”
&gt; 
&gt; This year, the group said it was adopting a new slogan, a quote from a July speech here by President Donald Trump : “We want God.”
&gt; 
&gt; The U.S. State Department didn’t respond to an email on Sunday seeking comment.
&gt; 
&gt; “This march is just an expression of a bigger social phenomenon, which is definitely very troubling, and is the growing acceptance of extreme nationalism and xenophobia among young people in Poland,” said Rafal Pankowski, a political-science professor at Collegium Civitas, a private university in Warsaw. “It is a contrast: Polish parents and grandparents are paradoxically more liberal than their young.”
&gt; 
&gt; Richard Spencer, an American until recently banned from 26 European countries who wants to create a country for white people in North America, was invited. The Polish government asked him to stay home, and he didn’t turn up.
&gt; 
&gt; Some Poles on Facebook and Twitter said they were staying away from the city center on Saturday to avoid potential violence. Three previous years’ marches devolved into tear-gas-clouded scuffles with police. Police detained at least 45 people on Saturday.
&gt; 
&gt; The crowds drawn to Saturday’s march reflect the politics taking hold in the soccer clubs and youth hangouts where National Radical Camp recruits. The group says the European Union and Russia represent equal threats to Polish sovereignty. It argues that Polish people should nationalize the assets belonging to foreign corporations and distribute profit across an ethnically homogenous state.
&gt; 
&gt; Similar movements have taken hold—and some have even captured seats in parliament—in Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.
&gt; 
&gt; The fear that Poland is under siege by distant elites has captured the imagination of some, as has the worry that hordes of immigrants could soon pour over the border. Government-controlled media broadcasts near-nightly reports on crimes committed by Muslims in Europe. On Saturday, Polish state television called the procession a “great march of patriots.”
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s like this inner need we have,” said Lukasz, a 24-year-old protester. “We want a Poland that will be for Polish people.”

2623,"&gt; Gotta strive to get up to that population replacement level or else you'll be having a major bulk of old people to take care of later.

Each person by default is a net drain on the state until education, training and tools raise their productivity to a net gain.* Replacement level is a good rule of thumb, but realistically as ""low end jobs"" get automated away we need to find way to turn future truck drivers and shelf stokers into a high skilled workforce rather than creating more of them. Quality upgrade beats even replacement level on this.

*Addendum: Unless you lower the welfare state and thus the quality of life of the workforce to lower the net-gain point.

&gt; Also possible fears of ""native"" population declining and their power and influence being usurped by a ""foreign"" population(i.e immigration etc)

Maybe this is happening at some base, reptile brain level, because the history of the past 2 centuries has not been a history of numbers winning out.

We now know that all the tools for what became the ""Green Revolution"" were already becoming available back then and their hysterics uncalled for.

Now we have politicians focusing on a ""demographic time bomb"" regarding the opposite, a population decline.

It's hard to feel bad for French and Germans at the economic population core of Europe complaining about our tax rate.

Those countries just naturally attract wealth and investment. Ireland, being a country with a low population, separated from Europe with a whole other island in between us, and having no valuable natural resources has to do something to attract wealth here.

Having a low corporate tax rate is an important part of being able to do so, along with the English language, close ties with the US, the use of the Euro and a highly educated population.

Forcing Ireland to abandon its tax rate will allow politicians in the core of European to claw a fee percentage points of support in the polls for a few weeks and fractions of a percent of increased GDP.

As a result, however, the Irish economy will implode and it's very likely that one of the most pro-EU countries, whose population must agree to every EU treaty change via referendum, will likely have its opinion of the EU irrevocably soured.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/7cfmd6/citizens_of_ireland_the_netherland_and_luxembourg/dpqk78d/,temujin64,1510542654

2735,"I think that soccer people tend to make their life about their club/country more than with any other sport. I should most definitely point out that the violent ones are a huge minority, alcohol makes them worse as well as group mentality. If you put up 1 violent idiot against 100 normal people, he will not be violent, the bigger the group, even if they are still at a 100 to 1 disadvantage. I know that the most violent fan groups of football/soccer clubs in my country have set up meetings just so they could go beat eachother up somewhere where the police isn't likely to stop them. People have died during that.

This isn't something about people in Europe in general, it is just that in some areas, the local football club is part of your identity. Insulting it would be like insulting their mother. It is also probably easier to go to an away match compared to the USA. In the Netherlands, the longest distance you will have to drive to get from 1 Eredivisie(highest division in our competition) football club to another is about 260 km. I am guessing that won't get you out of a state in the US in most occasions. That and the fact that clubs organize busses to move their fans with them on an away game is also a cause for more fans being present to clash. 

I believe that for  at least the last 5 fans from Ajax and Feyenoord, who have the biggest rivalry of them all, are not allowed to come to away games. The same thing happened with fans from Ajax when they went to Utrecht several years back, but that was because Utrecht fans had misbehaved during a previous match(pretty much everybody thought it was a stupid and wrong decision of the mayor, but in the end he has ultimate power in these kinds of cases).

2764,"&gt; I think that soccer people tend to make their life about their club/country more than with any other sport. I should most definitely point out that the violent ones are a huge minority, alcohol makes them worse as well as group mentality.

Clearly its enough people to be a self sustaining phenomenon and influence security policy at matches.

&gt;  I am guessing that won't get you out of a state in the US in most occasions

Depends where, you can get from where the Oakland Raiders play to where the San Francisco 49ers play in about a half hour of driving. That's just not a very fractious rivalry. 

Probably the only place where there's tension + short distances is in New England, where the New England Patriots (who play in Boston) are disliked by other sports fans in the area because they are a rich team who wins all the time. Even so, you'd have to go to a shitty bar and make an ass of yourself to get beaten up over a Patriots jersey. 

&gt; The same thing happened with fans from Ajax when they went to Utrecht several years back, but that was because Utrecht fans had misbehaved during a previous match(pretty much everybody thought it was a stupid and wrong decision of the mayor, but in the end he has ultimate power in these kinds of cases).

I think the key is that professional sports is very much a private enterprise. Someone who misbehaves at one game in one stadium can easily be blacklisted nationwide by organizations like the NFL and MLB.

Yeah, I guess.

&gt; Things like the Soviet Union and other countries did not fit any of the conditions for communism. They all had social classes, inequality, wage slavery and private property / capital

Well, fascism as an ideology does not, by itself, include militaristic expansionism, scientific racism, mass genocide etc. yet there they were.

&gt;  but it is still inherently racist and hateful.

No, it isn't.

It is merely an expression of totalitarianism, authoritarianism or autocratic rule.

It requires no hatred towards any particular group.

&gt; Fascists and Nazis no longer call themselves those words but they do take on new terms to disguise themselves and appeal to ordinary people. They are cloaked as ‘patriots’ ‘traditionalists’ and other such codes language.

Or, you know, it could be that most patriots aren't fascists or nazi's but some are.

2824,"&gt;why would Stalin have the need to execute three fourths of the founding fathers?

You have to stop thinking about them as politicians, they were all professional revolutionaries, political disagreement as major as one between Stalin and Trotsky could only be solved with one or the other dead. 

Stalin, being unable to take Trotsky out in time decided to take out those Trotskyists so they don't get a chance to coup the government, Ezhov, Stalin's NKVD chief went overboard and started persecuting w/o proper investigation, at first Stalin seen the amount of people condemned as confirmation of his worst fears, but eventually trough another NKVD officer, Beria, he found out that lots of cases are fabricated, shortly after the discovery Ezhov and few others responsible from his team were executed and large number (~100k-150k) of ""dissidents"" released from prison camps, sadly the discovery happened after the people who died in 1938 were dead.

This became known in History as the Great Purge.

However, the Secretary of State (Secretary of State of NI is the representative of the UK govt in NI) alone has the power to *call* a border poll in the first place - 

&gt; **Schedule 1**
&gt; 
&gt;1 - The Secretary of State may by order direct the holding of a poll for the purposes of section 1 on a date specified in the order.

&gt;2 - Subject to paragraph 3, the Secretary of State **shall exercise the power under paragraph 1 if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland.**


&gt;3 - The Secretary of State shall not make an order under paragraph 1 earlier than seven years after the holding of a previous poll under this Schedule.[12]

3138,"&gt;It means the same thing as cool if it is written in the correct context, which you didn't do. 

you are wrong, my sources point out that dope as an adjective can be used as slang for good/cool. this disproves your first claim that I don't know what the word means. Feel free to cite some sources proving me wrong, I'm more than willing to change my mind. writing that I don't have ""the correct context"", without elaborating what the correct context is or why my sources are wrong, that's is just a baseless claim though, so get some sources/a linguist or shut up.

&gt;You could say something like ""abortion is dope"". You cannot replace ""I'm cool with abortion"" with ""I'm dope with abortion"".

and in case you thought this citation *explains* why I'm wrong, well, it doesn't. you claimed I'm wrong, but you never explained why then you provided the following unexplained example. you are missing the reason. the why. 
see, assume you make the following statement on a rainy day: ""I'll explain why it rains."" and then you point at the rain and exclaim: ""there is no sun, but it is raining"". none of this explains why it's raining, it's merely an observation. that's what you're doing.

I never claimed everyone would understand slang. but I can use dope as a substitute for cool, that's the wonderful thing about slang.

Mind you, what you are pointing out is also a sign of the failure of the system. The system, as it is, would have never allowed Southern Europe to exit the mediocrity cap. Also, should Eastern Europe face mass newcomers into the EU, like SE did in 2004, Eastern Europe would fall downhill into stagnation. Trust me on this - before Erdogan, before Turkey's descent into Medieval times, Turkey's possible entry into the EU were already rustling some jimmies all over Central and Eastern European Union.

When you turned the EU from a socioeconomic-political project into an exploitative, free-market promoting behemoth, that allowed for growth built on slave wages in Southern Europe and, later, Eastern Europe, everyone is looking over its shoulder waiting for when the new mass of poor people is coming to take your jobs.

Add to that EC-mandated ""full work flexibility"", especially in Southern Europe, and the fact that the high-performers have been continuously growing during the last decades, and of course Portugal will always figure as being stagnated in that graph.

3251,"&gt; basically what you are saying is that we should have laws to send racists to prison. 

Hate-speech laws already exist in many places such as Sweden. The only problem with this is that there is sometimes a suppression of opinion when it comes to issues that do exist such as when there are discussions about integrating immigrants. 

First hanging and now prisons? I don't think anyone should be sent to prison for saying something racist and this is rarely the case even in the most accepting countries. However, when you reach the level of hate speech and promote violence against another social group then of course measures should be taken. You should know that there is a difference between hate-speech and racism. Everyone has the right to think or believe what they want but as soon as it starts to affect the safety or welfare of other citizens - this is when it becomes a substantial problem. This is precisely why  there are many comments against what is happening in Poland. 

&gt;Should I be allowed to criticize of lets say Islam, just like I am allowed to Christianity. Also just asking out of curiosity, are you a Putin supporter?

Of course you should, that is not hate-speech and not racism. You are criticizing a larger-scale system. If anything, I believe that this *should* be debated and critiqued. You have every right to. Is anyone saying you are not allowed to criticize Islam? Do so peacefully and not through violent means while promoting a destructive, violent ideology while doing so like some (but not all) people in this march.

After the genocide only few were left behind, some of them were Turkish who were already assimilated in Greek Pontic culture long before the genocide, some of them are Pontics who survived thanks to the kind people - non military citizens of Turkey. Now days after almost 100 years they are more Turkish than Greeks but they still keep the Greek traditions, without realising that those traditions are Greek. After the Genocide the Turkish ministry of internal affairs created a long campaign of propaganda that presented the Greek Pontic Music as Turkish and they stated that the music organ of Lyra was actually a Turkish one called kementze (src Michailidis, Anthropologist Princeton college. Speech during the Greek Pontic Summit). Today the Pontics of Turkey don't always realise that the Language they speak is not Turkified Greek but in fact are Romeika a pontic language derived directly by the ancient Greek. Yesterday the Tourism Organization offensively and blatantly presented our Pontic Traditions as Turkish in an effort to sell Black Sea Area destination....They didn't realise how offensive was to sell our own traditions as theirs especially to a city full of Survivors of the Greek pontic genocide, who lost their families, their friends and their homes during the Genocide.  We enjoy our free access and we love to travel to Black Sea and we also welcome the Turkish visitors in Thessaloniki this year where so many gathered outside kemals house that it created traffic problem, but we don't like to see our traditions being used or sold as Turkish to us. Don't get me wrong we love the turkish people, what we don't like its that the Turkish Goverment never recognised the Crrime of the Genocide and tried to use our traditions as Turkish in order to manipulate those who were left behind.

NSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS &gt; BLOG &gt; POLICIES &gt; TAX AND FISCAL POLICY
The lack of meaningful reform of business taxation is one of the great failures of recent governments. But with public pressure mounting, MPs will soon have to move beyond headline-grabbing at parliamentary grillings and consider the future of corporation tax.

We could of course muddle along and carry on taxing profits, perhaps gradually lowering the headline rate to align it with more competitive economies like Ireland. “An old tax is a good tax” goes a dictum among economists. Keeping things as they are enables people to plan confidently on the basis of current rules.

Yet it is likely that maintaining the existing system would have more costs than benefits. For one, corporation taxes discourage capital investment by lowering returns, which makes workers less productive, with long-term consequences for wage growth. Profits taxation encourages capital to move elsewhere, both because it makes the UK less attractive as a location for “real” economic activity and because it creates incentives for avoidance through complex business structures.

Half-hearted attempts to overcome these problems have played a key role in turning the UK tax system into the world’s most impenetrable. They have also poisoned the political debate, breeding contempt for business and undermining the public’s confidence that elected officials have their back. Given this resentment, it is likely that some change will be attempted – but what form might it take?

One option is to move in a more interventionist direction. Politicians could decide that it is more important to raise revenue than to encourage productive investment. To do that, they could radically change the way in which payable taxes are calculated, for instance by using a formula based on assets, staff and sales in each country where a company operates. Or they could use the location of customers as a proxy for determining where taxes should be paid – the so-called destination principle.

This would be a dramatic break with the past. It would end the long-standing principle that taxes are paid where value is created, rather than where sales are made or where the clerical staff work. But interventionist reforms could have damaging unintended consequences. A destination-based tax might well lead companies to stop selling in high-tax markets, to the detriment of consumers. And as far as the tax formula is concerned, can we really trust officials to come up with a calculation that is suitable for firms in many different sectors, with disparate cost and business structures?

It’s not even clear that these interventions would solve the avoidance problem. What would prevent firms from playing with intra-company sales to minimise payable taxes in high-tax countries? Would there really be no opportunities for arbitrage depending on how the tax formula was designed?

So, what could be done instead? We could move away from taxing profits at the company level, and towards taxing dividends. Note that this reform would still achieve the original purpose of corporation tax, namely to tax income from capital, but without the damaging side effects on investment and worker productivity.

Estonia, whose tax system has repeatedly been named the most competitive in the OECD by the Tax Foundation, already operates such a system. For practical purposes, taxes are withheld at the firm level, but only distributed profits – dividends – are taxable.

There’s no reason why the UK could not implement a similar reform. Importantly, while it would work best when coupled with a wider simplification and lowering of the tax burden, it could be designed to be revenue-neutral and may even raise additional revenue through higher personal income tax and VAT receipts, among others.

The controversy around corporation tax is a chance to move away from the complexity and opacity of the status quo. It should be seized. We need a more rational and honest way of taxing capital income based on the unavoidable fact that only people pay taxes.

Italy however had no obligation or treaties that would have made entering the war an obligation. The alliance agreement (between Germany, Austria and italy) was already changed in a way that allowed Italy to simply stay out. Italy was in the perfect situation to remain neutral, stay out and not add further destruction and death. But the Italian government was made of a bunch of greedy Imperialistic bastards. First it used the fact that Italy's technical allies were busy with a massive war against France, the UK, Russia and Serbia by saying ""if you want us to keep our neutrality and not switch sides we want more Austrian lands"" (which they even aggreed on) and then it still declared war on Austria, without any real need or any legal obligations for it (simply because of pure greed; France promising Italy that it would be allowed to keep all conquered lands afters the war).

3376,"&gt; Yeah, that's why German or French GDP per capita are higher than Luxembourg or Ireland, right? Wait...

Ireland had a GDP that was lower than the European average until 2000. Everyone likes to talk about Ireland's economy today. No one wants to acknowledge that in the 1980s, that GDP per capita in Ireland was half of Denmark. Ireland has only been wealthy in the last 15 years. Germans or French don't like to admit that. 

German, French etc only had an issue with our tax policy and our FDI policy when we were incredibly successful as an economy. 

&gt; What you described might happen, of course, but closing the door to tax havens will help everyone.

I don't see how tens of thousands losing their jobs in American firms in Dublin helps Ireland. I don't see how the 2.5 jobs indirectly supported by American firms being lost too helps the Irish either. I don't see how all the Germans, French, Italians, Greeks etc losing their jobs in American firms in Dublin will be happy with the EU either. 

Of course firms are not just here for tax. They are here for the fact, we are pro-business. We don't have bullshit labour laws like France. We don't try to actively fuck up operations of foreign firms operating in Ireland. We welcome them with open arms. This is a policy that France should try

&gt; For sure European companies do this too because to stay competitive they need do as their American competition. 

I'm sorry. But this is really fucked up. You only have a problem with tax avoidance, when an American firm is engaging in it...

Do you know how Irish firms stay competitive? We aim to become the biggest firms in our industry, export heavily and expand our operations abroad to be big and competitive. Paddypower, Ryanair, CRH, Glanbia, Kerry etc. They did not rely on illegal state aid or tax avoidance to remain competitive 

&gt; When this is fixed then the governments can curb the EU companies as well.

Not acceptable. After you the EU has fucked up the economies of Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta etc then you try to level the playing field. 

The EU is about increasing the standard of living for all Europeans. It should not be increasing the standard of living for just French and Germans, who attack the policies of small nations instead of dealing with poor policies in their own nation. France's economy is shit, as their labour laws and policies for FDI are shit. France should focus on reforming their own policies for economic growth, than trying to sabotage other successful nations.

If there are various indicators suggesting that there may be a problem in Poland - there should be steps taken to investigate the problem and find a possible solution.

3604,"&gt; You don't need to speak German to hold a conversation with a German. Just speak Dutch and it will sound like utter gibberish to us, true but it will be semi understandable if you are okay with us constantly asking: ""Was, wiebitte, entschulding ich habe Sie nicht verstanden, können sie das nochmal wiederholen, etc."". Same vice versa.

So you'd understand a very simple conversation, speaking slowly. Same here, I just don't consider that being able to speak the language.

&gt; I mean here is a self-experiment.

Your self-experiment is reading though, it's quite different from talking. Just see how much trouble you had with some parts while reading, and you can even take your time reading and looking at the rest of the sentence to figure out the meaning just from context. I think people just overestimate their language skills, or underestimate what it takes to hold a conversation.

If introducing yourself, asking the location of something, and thanking them is enough to count as a conversation then I can speak German, French, Mandarin, Spanish, and it wouldn't take too long to learn a couple more languages as well. But in reality I couldn't have a conversation about the vast majority of topics.

EU would  fund 50% of it through NSRF- the other 50% would be paid by the target state itself. There was a condition however. Greece/Portugal had to make biddings open to construction companies of all EU states. Norther European companies being more afluent and competitive usually won these competitions partly or fully. The result was that northern EU countries indirectly/legally subsidized their companies and their economy and the southerns got infrastructure. Win-win situation promoting camaraderie and development.

And ""Khazaria"" is not a source. It's literally one dude talking about haplogroups. Haplogroups are irrelevant as i mentioned before when it comes to actual genetics. Besides haplogroups also prove that we're indeed related to Central Asia to some extent.

Oh and about Khazaria's post
""In 2003, Cinnioğlu et al. made a research of Y-DNA including the samples from eight regions of Turkey, without classifying the ethnicity of the people, which indicated that high resolution SNP analysis totally provides evidence of a detectable weak signal (&lt;9%) of gene flow from Central Asia, but this was an underestimate summarizing only haplogroups C, Q, O and N""

If you didn't understand i'll explain: Mongoloid haplogroups aren't the only haplogroups that Central Asians brought as (i mentioned before) that Central Asians themselves don't have predominantly mongoloid haplogroups (your dienekes haplogroup blog post also mentions that)


""the evidence is so overwhelming""
what evidence? :DDD and you don't understand anything about genetics. leave it to pros like me. 
Among the studies you posted, literally almost all of them are about haplogroups. So haplogroups are irrelevant by default. Autosomal dna studies are literally from blogs.

Since the mosquito and piglet thing confused you, let's go for two creatures of the same species, but different 'breeds', or 'races': A labrador and a chihuahua. 

Same species, very different anatomy. Obviously their genes play a huge role in this: you can raise a chihuahua in the exact same way that you raise a labrador, but it's still always going to be a little braindead inbred runt. Different, also, is their average intelligence, and this trend is clear enough over all the different dog breeds (ie. that some are smarter than others) that it's not even really controversial at all. 

If you stick a chihuahua in a pram and put it to bed in its cot each night, feed it human formula and read to it, it's still going to be a stupid dog. To believe that genetics has zero effect whatsoever on intelligence would be to believe that replicating a human childhood environment exactly will, on average, produce intellectual outcomes on par with humans... which is absurd. Obviously the genetic differences between a White and a black are much much smaller than the differences between man and dog, but there are differences. It's logical then that these might manifest in some observable racial differences, just like how the labrador and the chihuahua have their differences.

&gt; Nederland is een van de samenstellende landen van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden.[8] Het land ligt voor het overgrote deel in het noordwesten van Europa, aan de Noordzee. In het zuiden wordt het begrensd door België, langs de oostgrens door Duitsland en aan west- en noordzijde door de zee. De hoofdstad van Nederland is Amsterdam, de regeringszetel is Den Haag.

This is my translation:

&gt; The Netherlands is a country that is part of the kingdom of Netherlands. The country lies before the overgrown (ok, I know overgrote does not mean overgrown but I've got no clue) part in the Northwest of Europe at the North Sea. In the south it is bordered by Belgium, in the east by Germany and in the west by the northside of the sea (?). The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam, the constitutional court (?) is in Den Haag.

I understood what it is saying just fine but the grammar is a nightmare.

3951,"&gt;So, you think the german people would just not mind at all that they are now ruled by defacto french and british people?

So you think, there is such thing as some kind of undomitable national spirit? That the common people would rise up? That there would be absolutely no one among the german people to execute this? Really? That's quite an interesting opinion. As someone who lives quite near Vichy, I have another one. 

You *will* always find someone willing to cooperate with foreign power, not necessarily because they are willing to see their country being de factor ruled by the very same foreign powers they hate, but because they are willing to spare something way worse on their countrymen when they know they are in an *hopeless* situation. And when I mean ""someone"", I mean that not only a *significant* part of the population *will* actively cooperate for the very same reasons, but the *complete majority* of the population will, *always*, cooperate passively. The people do *not* care about being ruled by another country. They do *not* care about being ""stript of their freedom"". There is *no* such thing as a successful popular uprising that emerges when there is *no hope* of victory for the movement to begin with at all, and the thing is that any kind of fringe resistance movement that emerges out of a crushing defeat has, precisely, *no hope* of victory if it's not for a foreign intervention. Which is a possibility, that is entirely eliminated in this scenario. Not to mention, that, you know, half of the young men that could potentially join an uprising before 1914 are *dead*. For real, the resistance barely accomplished anything before it became clear that victory was possible when the soviets pushed out the germans, and they had significant foreign help. You see now why I do not trust for a *second* in this *fantasy* of a national uprising?

And no, don't compare the russian parts owned by germany to this situation. Victory against a germany that was at war *was* possible. ""Victory"" (which, I suppose, amounts to the reunification of germany) against the allied powers in times of peace is impossible. 

Tl;dr people don't fight because they are oppressed, they fight because there is a *chance* that they can hope for their situation to improve. The point is to completely destroy that hope. 

And I do not talk about americans because the entire point of the scenario is that they accept the treaty to begin with you dummy. Who cares about them so much anyway? It's the british that were most relevant in pushing for a less punitive treaty for Germany.

Also Joko, have you taken an IQ test before? Send me the results if you have. Do you think genetic discussion is a card game?

Have you actually tried to refute it? :DDD And now you're posting a blog whose source comes from Dienekes the Greek blogger :DDD you're really pathetic.


Imma post an another study 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4904778/figure/F6/

Turkish genes are neither close to Armenia nor Central asia. But to Northern Caucasia. That's because they also have Turkic genes and West Asian genes just like us. Hence they're very similar to us. But the central asians in the study are Hazaras, Kyrgyzes and Uygurs, way more mongoloid than any Turk or Seljuk.

By the way, since you love dienekes, i'll post the simpler version of the study
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rcdkNaYFICM/Tz1p4IcLlZI/AAAAAAAAEhs/En5H2fWIh68/s1600/ADMIXTURE+Turkish_Aydin_Ho_3.png
This sample was taken from the study that i posted. Turks on average are 14-15% mongoloid from that part of Turkey. Which makes them at least 40-50% Turkic (Seljuk) genetic wise.

Here now compare Turks to Armenians racially

I just don't agree that gays and jews and minorities should be eliminated from public life. I'm dope with abortions. I also disagree with their totalitarian dictatorship approach at politics, as beating, imprisoning and killing people you disagree with is not part of my idea of how a society should function. 

&gt;Chants: ""Respect and honor to the heroes"", ""Pride, pride, national pride!"", ""God, Honor, Homeland"", ""We want God"", ""Freedom, equality, justice"", ""Catholic Poland, not secular"", ""Respect and honor to the heroes, white-red unconquered colors"".

The people marching with these fascist groups are at least polish nationalists, judging by the translated slogans you provided. And I kinda assume they are also sympathetic to these fascist groups, as the march is well known for being a far-right march and I'm just not naive enought to belive that tens of thousands of polish nationalist accidentally join a fascist gathering.

Okay.

Culture is not static, yes, it evolves and changes over time. But that cultural change is driven by events that arose organically from the history of that people. There is a historical continuity to the cultural change that gives a common culture and unifies a people with a common history.

What cultural change is NOT is moving, say, hundreds of thousands of Pakistani Muslims to England, and then proclaiming that English culture has changed. 

An ethnic European from 100 years ago would very much still recognise an ethnic European today. 

An Englishman from 100 years ago would, upon finding himself transported from his London of 100 years ago to the London of today, walking through many of its boroughs find himself, an Englishman, appearing to be a foreigner in his own homeland.

4371,"&gt;Education and criminal background are already part of the immigration application process. 

They are to very basic extents only. There is certainly not much of a selection process going on here in Germany with regards to immigration from Africa or the Middle East for example.

Either way, even if you would find the most educated, most wealthy, most i-don't-know-what Africans or Asians or Latin Americans or Congolese Pygmies or whatever, I wouldn't want millions of them migrating to my country or Europe either, because I want Europe to stay European.

Up until a few decades ago that has been considered to be perfectly normal and reasonable even in Europe - to put oneself and one's people (your ""tribe) before others.

In a similar sense, the life of my children is more important to me than that of others. The life of my friends, family, of my neighbor's children is more important to me than that of someone thousands of miles away. In a larger sense, my ethnicity and race are an extension of what humans earlier would have considered to be their tribe and for almost all of humanity's existence, except the past century, it was considered perfectly normal and moral to put the fate of yourself, your family and the people that are like you in your community before that of others outside of that community. This is an inherent evolutionary drive that almost all humans share.

The immigration policies I want are nothing but a reflection of that.

&gt;So you'd be ok with nationality discrimination because it would fulfill the goal of racial discrimination well enough? and you act offended that people call you racist?

I'm not offended at all and I *am* racist in some ways, it's just that the word ""racist"" usually evokes images of Nazis sending Jews to the gas chambers, or the KKK hanging Blacks or other such atrocities, which is far from what I'm advocating for.

All I want, is for Europe to be recognized as the homeland of the European people, in which they will represent the ethnic and racial majority for the foreseeable future. And to recognize that Western culture is European culture and that it wouldn't exist without the people that created it - Europeans. And I want immigration policies that reflect that and protect Europeans and their continued existence.

And I recognize racial and ethnic differences, which are nothing but inherent biological and genetic differences in human populations that have developed over the span of thousands of years due to natural selection and evolutionary processes. 

If that's racist, then as already said - I'll gladly be racist.",,/r/europe/comments/7c7gcv/generation_identity_farright_group_sending_uk/dpo2t4l/,_-_-_-__-_,1510416948

Well we agree to disagree on that topic then

&gt;Yes, and it's important to point out when they're doing it

I don't really see why. People who fall prey to a twisted truth eventually will come across information that will enable them to see reason. If they aren't able to see reason, then they were a lost cause to begin with and no matter how hard you try you can't change such people.

So how I see it, we have people temporarily astray that possibly could sooner be recovered when one always points out far right's doings, we have people who could have been lead asrtay but weren't due to them being pointed out, but who then loose out on an important experience that would have taught them to be more cautious in the future and people who wouldn't care either way because they flat out don't believe in anything that doesn't their world view.

&gt;The EF English Proficiency Index (EF EPI) attempts to rank countries by the average level of English language skills amongst those adults who took the EF test. The index is based on data from a survey, not on a representative sampling model. It is ""not a statistically controlled study""

And looking at [Hungary's ranking fluctuations](http://www.ef.com/epi/regions/europe/hungary/) makes me believe they have a small sampling size, so their rankings fluctuate significantly.

In the end is english proeficiency of people who took an online test. And english proeficiency is about how good people who took the test speak english not how much of the population speaks english.

This is supposedly done in conventional farming to prevent the sow from lying on top of the piglets but has no basis in science. 

The piglets have to stay with there mother for longer. In conventional pig farming the essentially take them away too early and give them solid food in order to grow them faster. The piglets, however sometimes cannot take this solid food and get diarrhoea but then the pig farmer just spreads some antibiotics in the feed and it goes away. In return we humans get MRSA bacteria which is EVERYwhere in Danish pig farms.

4624,"You're right this data may be flawed, but I think it somewhat resembles the popularity of English in countries. I would need to read more about the methodology but this is something I found: 

&gt;

Although the sample of test takers for the EF EPI is biased toward respondents who are interested in pursuing language study, the sample is balanced between male and female respondents and represents adult language learners from a broad range of ages.

    Female respondents comprised 47.8% of the overall sample.
    The median age of adult respondents was 26 years.
    79% of all respondents were under the age of 35, and 99% under the age of 60.
    The median age of male and female respondents was the same.

Because respondents are motivated to take the test by their interest in learning English, the sample should consist primarily of workingaged adults, with a bias toward students and people at the beginning of their careers.

Only countries with a minimum of 400 test takers were included in the index, but in most cases the number of test takers was far greater. A total of 80 countries and territories were included.

She was 12 when the war started, and she had to drop out of school and go to a factory because of that. Her family struggled with food, the area she lived in was bombed by German airplanes. One day, closer to the end of this war, she witnessed a group of German POWs escorted by Soviet soldiers. She was carrying a bag of onions, and one prisoner begged her for food. She felt pity for him and gave him an onion, and he gave her a ring in return. The ring was immediately taken from her by the guards, however. For some reason, she remembered this moment really well, and still felt sad for this person after all those years. The point is, that even during those atrocious times, constantly feeling hungry, she was able to sympathize with an actual German soldier who invaded her homeland.","Russia, Nizhny Novgorod",/r/europe/comments/7c3w4i/two_soviet_infantrymen_frozen_to_death_in_their/dpnpmc1/,Dalnore,1510387751

Basically flexible-security, inspired by your system. He improved the formation given to those who have no job, so that they can find a job.

&gt; stop ISF (impot sur la fortune) for the richests

Suppressed a capital tax on non-real estate. It was a tax based on the value of what you had, not the income.

&gt; cuts on foundings for local collectivity

Suppressed a tax for the 80% least rich (the housing tax), payed by everyone no matter their income.

&gt; cuts for the hospitals

Budget cuts for the administration of the health ministry, not hospitals.

&gt; cuts on Social Security revenus
&gt; Give money to big industry with CICE

Lower tax on social security for the low income salary (2.5 times the minimum wage, so it's for people who work a job, not for capital income)

&gt; cuts on pensions

Increased a tax paid on every income, to compensate for the lower tax on low income salary. So pensioners will pay more of that tax, and it will be compensate for 60% of them with the suppression of the ""housing tax"".

&gt; cuts everywhere

To respect the 3% budget deficit (fun fact, we have been in deficit since 1974, no problem according to our left because the solution is to leave the Euro and print money).

4754,"Not atleast in Finland. Whatever the politicians/groups opinion on joining NATO is, the one thing all can pretty much agree on this is issue way beyond simple Parliamentary majority vote. All major parties have said, that just like with joining EU it will take a referendum to join NATO due to the magnitude of the issue. Specially remember Finland is a conscription country so military alliance is of special nationwide significance. Just this summer Parliament made a separate law finally authorizing using Finnish Defence Forces soldiers for aiding another **EU member** nations defence in accordance with Lisbon Treaty. Even then it will be mostly volunteers or the professional cadre.

So we really aren't neutral anymore. However we aren't in camp NATO rather we are in camp EU. Which may sound like the same camp to some people, but atleast in Finland the difference is rather significant to people. And atleast given the 59% no to joining in last pall seems to indicate most Finns think being in camp EU is enough in addition the our own national defence readiness.

Technically Parliament as the legislature could make joining decision alone with simple majority (assuming president doesn't veto. Which president actually probably would do and say 'make a referendum out of this'), since it is essentially ratifying a treaty via a law issue. In practice a guiding referendum will be held and as per long standing tradition and principle Parliament will honor the result of the referendum. 

I think technically Parliament could even decide referendum is directly binding, since organizing referendums happens by one time use laws given by parliament in Finland and thus under authority of parliamentarily ratified law parliament could degree the referendum binding before hand.

 However typically they don't. Rather it is before hand publicly declared by parties that honoring the referendum result shall be a matter of democratic principle and honor for their MPs.

4783,"The bad thing about graphs that show installed power is that they huge inflate the usefulness of solar and wind power.

The capacity factor indicates how much a power plant really produces compared to its nominal power.

Nuclear power has a ""natural"" capacity factor of about 90%, whereas coal and gas have capacity factors in the range 60-70%.

For ""renewables"" these factors are however much worse. Photovoltaic has a capacity factor of not more then 10% in Germany (up to 20% in sunny countries) and wind farms range from 30-50%.

To worsen facts giving ""priority to renewables"" reduces also to the capacity factor of classic power generators. 
The classic power generators (coal, gas nuclear) are forcibly switched off when the sun shines or the wind blows. Without storage this actually means that the installed classic power can not be reduced at all when solar and wind are installed.

The graph actually shows this nicely: 
 
* 2002: installed classical power: 100 GW vs installed renewable power 8 GW
* 2017: installed classical power: 100 GW vs installed renewable power 100 GW

The power consumption in Germany stayed virtually unchanged in that same period of time.

The really shocking result: 
* adding more renewables does not reduce the need for classical power. 
* adding more renewables makes classical power generation more expensive because it reduces the capacity factor of classical production. This particularly bad for capital intensive plants (ex. nuclear)
* even renewables at zero cost don't have a positive effect on electricity cost.

Conclusion: If the goal is to reduce CO2 there are two options. The first option is to go with as much nuclear as possible. It will reduce CO2 dramatically (up to 80% reduction) without increase of electricity cost. The second option is to go renewable all the way, which without storage (and economical storage solutions don't really exist yet) has a maximum potential for CO2 reduction of 10-30% because of capacity factors.

If reducing CO2 is the goal, nuclear is the economical engineering solution, renewables is an expensive religion.",Luxembourg,/r/europe/comments/7c2hn3/carbon_intensity_of_electricity_grams_of_co2kwh/dpnq4du/,peeterko,1510389160

4786,"Deepl translation

The Brussels Bozar is what one calls a good address in the cultural scene: photography, music, fine arts, theatre, literature - the Bozar is a place of inspiration, exchange and understanding. Last Tuesday, however, the Bozar was the scene of a strange event.

Around 200 mayors from Catalonia flew in to express their solidarity with the deposed and fugitive regional president Carles Puigdemont. A large hall in the Bozar was available and many journalists came. When Puigdemont entered the hall, the mayors rose and cheered:""President! President! President!"" They held up their Varas, those metal-clad sticks that mayors wear on special occasions. This was followed by a number of Catalan speakers who spoke with great emphasis. Their message, in one sentence: the Catalan people will be oppressed by Spain, and the Catalans will throw this yoke!

Finally, Puigdemont himself, the man sought by the Spanish judiciary with a European arrest warrant, appeared. ""Spain has carried out a coup d' état against a legitimate parliament and government. You can't live in this country where you have to be afraid to express yourself,""he said. And:""Spain has no shame in using fascism!""
Dangerous trivialisation

This is an absurd assertion and at the same time a dangerous trivialisation of the crimes of historical fascism. But Puigdemont is a populist, differentiation is not his business, nor is communication and reconciliation. That evening in the Bozar, the uninvolved listener got the feeling that the man was from the 19th century - when nations were actually oppressed by empires. 

Puigdemont has fled to Brussels, according to its own statements, because it is there that the ""heart of Europe"" beats. He wants to achieve what the separatists wanted to achieve from the outset: to internationalize the Catalonian crisis. The EU should intervene, of course in favour of the separatists. However, the EU has so far, for good reasons, refrained from tackling this conflict.

Puigdemont therefore decided to attack the EU in the same way as he would attack Spain. Addressing Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Parliament's President Tajani, Mr Puigdemont said:""Do you really want to continue to support the coup d' état of Mariano Rajoy?

Is anti-EU populism really dead?

The EU as an accomplice of Spanish fascism; the EU as part of a power cartel that oppresses peoples. Do we really have to take these claims seriously?

Of course not, of course. But they must be feared. The Catalan separatists always say that they are convinced Europeans, and we want to believe them. However, Puigdemont's recent attacks against the EU put him in a dangerous proximity to convinced anti-Europeans such as the French right-wing extremist Marie Le Pen. It often describes Europe as a ""people's prison"".

The Catalan separatists rightly point out that there are no right-wing extremists among them. Their political spectrum ranges from bourgeois-liberal to left-wing, and there is no trace of right-wing extremist tradition. But in Bozar, in Brussels, Puigdemont's attacks on the EU were hardly distinguishable from those of its enemies.

At the beginning of the year, many feared that the harvest year could be 2017 for populists. However, Geert Wilders did not win in the Netherlands, but Marine Le Pen lost to pro-European Emmanuel Macron in France. Perhaps the anti-European populism was declared dead too soon.

In Brussels, of all places, he gives a sign of life again, from an unexpected corner.

4919,"&gt;A handful of Russian nuclear facilities are located roughly in the region where the ruthenium originated, including a large nuclear reprocessing plant known as the Mayak Production Association.

Mayak's a familiar name.  That site probably had more radiation exposure incidents than any other Soviet site.

[*A Review of Criticality Accidents*](https://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/accidents/la-13638.pdf) for small accidents.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyshtym_disaster

&gt;After World War II, the Soviet Union lagged behind the US in development of nuclear weapons, so it started a rapid research and development program to produce a sufficient amount of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium. The Mayak plant was built in haste between 1945 and 1948. Gaps in physicists' knowledge about nuclear physics at the time made it difficult to judge the safety of many decisions. Environmental concerns were not taken seriously during the early development stage. Initially Mayak was dumping high-level radioactive waste into a nearby river, which flowed to the river Ob, flowing further down to the Arctic Ocean. All six reactors were on Lake Kyzyltash and used an open-cycle cooling system, discharging contaminated water directly back into the lake.[3] When Lake Kyzyltash quickly became contaminated, Lake Karachay was used for open-air storage, keeping the contamination a slight distance from the reactors but soon making Lake Karachay the ""most-polluted spot on Earth"".[4][5][6]
&gt;
&gt;A storage facility for liquid nuclear waste was added around 1953. It consisted of steel tanks mounted in a concrete base, 8.2 meters (27 ft) underground. Because of the high level of radioactivity, the waste was heating itself through decay heat (though a chain reaction was not possible). For that reason, a cooler was built around each bank, containing 20 tanks. Facilities for monitoring operation of the coolers and the content of the tanks were inadequate.[7]
&gt;
&gt;In 1957 the cooling system in one of the tanks containing about 70–80 tons of liquid radioactive waste failed and was not repaired. The temperature in it started to rise, resulting in evaporation and a chemical explosion of the dried waste, consisting mainly of ammonium nitrate and acetates (see ammonium nitrate/fuel oil bomb). The explosion, on 29 September 1957, estimated to have a force of about 70–100 tons of TNT,[citation needed] threw the 160-ton concrete lid into the air.[7] There were no immediate casualties as a result of the explosion, but it released an estimated 20 MCi (800 PBq) of radioactivity. Most of this contamination settled out near the site of the accident and contributed to the pollution of the Techa River, but a plume containing 2 MCi (80 PBq) of radionuclides spread out over hundreds of kilometers.[8] Previously contaminated areas within the affected area include the Techa river, which had previously received 2.75 MCi (100 PBq) of deliberately dumped waste, and Lake Karachay, which had received 120 MCi (4,000 PBq).[6]
&gt;
&gt;In the next 10 to 11 hours, the radioactive cloud moved towards the north-east, reaching 300–350 km (190–220 mi) from the accident. The fallout of the cloud resulted in a long-term contamination of an area of more than 800 to 20,000 km2 (310 to 7,720 sq mi), depending on what contamination level is considered significant, primarily with caesium-137 and strontium-90.[6] This area is usually referred to as the East-Ural Radioactive Trace (EURT).[9]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Karachay

&gt;The sediment of the lake bed is estimated to be composed almost entirely of high level radioactive waste deposits to a depth of roughly 11 feet (3.4 m).

-

&gt;In the 1960s, the lake began to dry out; its area dropped from 0.5 km2 in 1951[4] to 0.15 km2 by the end of 1993.[9] In 1968, following a drought in the region, the wind carried 185 PBq (5 MCi) of radioactive dust away from the dried area of the lake, irradiating half a million people.[3]

-

&gt;The radiation level in the region near where radioactive effluent is discharged into the lake was 600 röntgens per hour (approximately 6 Sv/h) in 1990, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Natural Resources Defense Council,[5][6] sufficient to give a lethal dose to a human within an hour.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7c564p/mysterious_radioactive_cloud_over_europe_hints_at/dpnjadf/,vokegaf,1510374538

this will make you laugh

&gt; Famous playboy bunny Pamela Anderson is also on the list of crossed people. Not only that she believed in the legitimacy of the heir of Montenegro and Macedonia, **but she knelled before him**, to receive a title of Countess of 'lily of Santa Maria Ligure ""and was named the"" Great Lady of Montenegro "".

&gt; On the ""solemn ceremony"" to mark the declaration of title, Pamela also gave a speech, said Repubbica.it.

- Your Majesty, I'm truly honored and grateful for this recognition of the Imperial house of Montenegro and i am moved by your generosity - said the actress to Stefan Cernetic

...

&gt; But the fairy tale full of expensive drinks, beautiful women, good cars, luxury villas and expensive cigars, it had to come to an end. In an elite resort in Fusina,  Prince made a bulky account, and the manager then forwarded it to the Embassy of Macedonia in Italy. The reply came as a cold shower - do not send us the bills, we do not have a prince, and I certainly do not share it with Montenegro

here comes the shocker 

&gt; Taking in consideration that not only politicians and rich enterpreteurs fell for his acting, but also important people from the entire Europe, the knowledge about the fake prince disturbed the public so much that Carabinieri intervened from Brindisi, Turin, Bergamo and Avelina, writes Repubbica.it.

&gt; **Italian media do not state exactly why it took almost a year to open the case and to arrest Carnetic, but they they list that that diplomatic passports, stickers diplomatic corps, international awards, certificates royal house Montenegro and various degrees were confiscated during the arrest.**

Where? When? Have you ever seen a world map drawn just after WW2? Self determination was pushed by the USA after WW1 and even more after WW2 against national interests in order to break down empires and gain trade advantage. The English and French empires disappeared, and the process was not fair and democratic in most cases.

&gt; If it's wrong in one case, it's wrong in the other. Whataboutism is not a valid or defensible argument. 

Exactly. I'm fine with Crimea going away from Russia as long as Kosovo goes back to Serbia. That would be entertaining!

&gt; Probably in the same ways that other multiethnic, multilingual, multiconfessional countries do, like Switzerland, Canada, India....

1/ Switzerland had centuries upon centuries to build its very specific governmental system, and they all had to work together in order to stay strong.

2/ Canada had to quasi-genocide the French, later give greater autonomy to Quebec in order to avoid independence, and even now Quebec still wants to get out. Such great integration! Quebec and the rest of Canada do not hate each other as much too!

3/ I am not sure we can consider India a democracy, with no freedom of the press, a caste system, and etc. But why not... Still, very different from a country with 2 populations hating each other living face to face.

&gt; Narva and Riga are perfectly analogous to the situation in Ukraine

&gt;In 1994 the Wright Laboratory in Ohio, a predecessor to today's United States Air Force Research Laboratory, produced a three-page proposal on a variety of possible nonlethal chemical weapons, which was later obtained by the Sunshine Project through a Freedom of Information Act request.

&gt; In both of the documents, the possibility was canvassed that a strong aphrodisiac could be dropped on enemy troops, ideally one which would also cause ""homosexual behavior"". The documents described the aphrodisiac weapon as ""distasteful but completely non-lethal"".

&gt;Bremelanotide (tentative brand name Rekynda; former developmental code name PT-141) is a peptide melanocortin receptor agonist which is under development by Palatin Technologies as a treatment for female sexual dysfunction.[2][3]
&gt;
&gt;In January 2017, Palatin Technologies successfully completed two phase III clinical trials of bremelanotide for female sexual dysfunction.[2] The developers of the drug have announced their intention to submit a New Drug Application of bremelanotide for female sexual dysfunction in early 2018.[2]

In addition to that there is the Flanders House, which is basically the official representation of the Flemish gouvernement in New York in a completely seperate location.)

	EU member states should be allowed to suspend the application of new EU laws they oppose, Poland’s prime minister has argued in a speech on the bloc’s future.

Since the UK voted to leave the EU, European leaders have been casting around for ways to give the European project fresh impetus, and in recent months French President Emmanuel Macron and the head of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker have both set out strongly integrationist visions of the EU’s future.

However, many countries in central and eastern Europe are deeply sceptical of ceding further powers to Brussels, and in a speech in Warsaw on Thursday Beata Szydlo said the EU should pay greater heed to the will of national parliaments.

She argued that failing to do so would be an “easy recipe for a next integration crisis”.

“The decision-making process in the EU must be rooted as strongly as possible in the will of the voters. For this reason, we are in favour of strengthening the national parliaments in the EU legislative process,” Ms Szydlo said.

“The system of taking decisions by majority in the European Council has to be balanced with the possibility of letting national parliaments suspend legislative initiatives, especially in situations where a certain government doesn’t support a particular initiative but has been outvoted.”

	Attempts by governments to resist the passage of EU legislation are as old as the bloc itself — dating back to French opposition in the 1960s to the loss of national vetoes and greater use of majority voting. David Cameron also sought to beef up national parliaments’ powers to halt EU projects as part of his doomed attempt to renegotiate Britain’s membership of union.

But the issue has gained fresh relevance as calls from Mr Macron and Mr Juncker for more decisive EU policymaking raise concerns that countries could be railroaded as capitals push to close deals.

These fears have been heightened in central and eastern Europe by EU efforts to tighten restrictions on workers sent abroad on temporary contracts. The plans have been at the centre of a bruising legislative battle that culminated last month when several countries, including Hungary and Poland, voted against the reform but were unable to find enough allies to stop it.

The topic is one of a number of issues — ranging from the rule of law to how to accommodate the huge influx of refugees that arrived on the continent’s shores in 2015 and 2016 — on which Warsaw and Brussels have clashed over the past two years.

Ms Szydlo stressed that, despite the tensions, there was no risk of Poland leaving the bloc. She pointed out that no parties in the Polish parliament were in favour of withdrawing — in contrast to the situation in Czech Republic and Slovakia.

However, she warned that the EU would have to take into account the wishes of its central and eastern member states in the debate over its future, and not just the views of “three or four capitals”.

“Two years ago our region [central Europe] didn’t exist as a reference point on the political map of Europe. Today anyone who seriously thinks about the future of our continent must enter into a dialogue with the central European countries,” she said.

5319,"Defaulting as a legal term is just when the creditor refuses to pay outstanding debts, be it due to not having the money or political reasons doesn't really matter since you default on your obligations in both situations. Size of the default isn't really relevant as a state can default over a sum as small as a single cent.   
The First default was in 1918. Unlike the UK and France, the Germans had not raised taxes, and had opted to finance their war with war bonds of various alloys and the printing press. Which is pretty much identical to the way the Germans had funded the Franco Prussian war. These loans Defaulted in 1918 due to Germany having run out of Cash, and no influx of new capital because it had lost the war.
Germany once again defaulted in 1931-33, meaning at all Versailles Reparation payments were stopped. (keep in mind that scuttling fleets was considered by Germany to be paying reparations). At this point, Germany had paid around 90 Billion USD today's equivalent. (more on that and the French indemnity later on).  
The 1953 London Debt agreement saw another 50% reduction of German incurred Debt. This deal only happened because due to the German government signalling that it would no longer pay its debts unless a deal could be made to reduce the debt. This is where more western European countries were pressed to waive the Debts Germany incurred under Nazi Occupation.  
In 1990 Chancellor Helmund Kohl refused to pay off the last part of the 1953 debt deal. Granted the Germans did pay off the last deferred interest installment, but did default on the last bit of their WWI/WWII debt, which is constitutes a default in the legal sense of the word. 
The reason onto the 1871 Reparations the French paid. Under the terms, the French were forced to pay 5 Billion gold Marks in 5 years. To give you an idea, that is somewhere between 364 Billion and 500 Billion USD today. The French didn't only pay this sum in full, They *finished paying it 2 years ahead of schedule, in 1873*. This massive influx of Gold into the German economy caused a massive bubble that led to a 19 year global recession from 1876 onward. 
For Comparison, the German ecnomomy in 1918 was several times the size of the Frenco one in 1871, wasn't occupied, and while was forced to cede territory, its ability to pay back is rather sad when you consider they paid back around 185 Billion USD today equivalent back in 15 years. Part of these Reparations were only done in the 23-24 period, when the French had invaded the Ruhr over the fact that the Germans defaulted on their debt on a near weekly basis.  
  
This is why i find any discussion about debt mentality and Germany funny. They shout at everybody that they need to pay debts, while the overwhelming majority of them have a far better history of paying back then the Germans themselves.

&gt;We've had plenty of evidence of that not least from online comments sections, pro Brexit journalists, etc. Small minded imperialist xenophobia from top to bottom.

Funny because I've sat down and talks to lots of leave voters and don't think that's true at all. (though i understand why you might get that impression if all your information comes from Reddit though)

They are reasonable kind people who do understand both the pros and cons of leaving the EU and made a choice. 

If you can't be bothered to sit down and talk calmly and reasonable to people about why they voted to leave. that doesn't mean you can brand them all small minded imperialist xenophobe's.

That is to say, it doesn't settle the issue one way or the other. Furthermore, *even if* the degree of institutional independence were more marked, it doesn't strike me as logically necessary to link that with a greater or lesser right to self-determination by means of independence referenda. If the criteria is previous independence, then you'd need to concede the right of the territory of the former Kingdom of Aragon to secede as a bloc, and I think we would both agree that's absurd.

Culturally, the simple fact that one has its own language and the other doesn't (Scots Gaelic is spoken by, essentially, [no one](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-24281487), and Scots [is widely considered](http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2010/01/06105123/0), even by people who speak it principally, to be a dialect of English) seems to suggest that there may be a greater degree of independent national identity in Catalonia than Scotland, as language [is widely considered](http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/02/01/language-the-cornerstone-of-national-identity/) vital to delineating national groups.

Look, Catalonia is, of course, part of Spain. Personally, I hope it stays that way. Most Catalans feel both Spanish and Catalan, and would probably prefer not to have to choose between their layers of identity. But by seeking to claim that they are not a group of people in which these rights inhere, the Spanish government has undermine the compatibility of these identities, and I see that as a bad thing.

Once again, go fuck yourself, you cunt.

Either these people are naive, wilfully ignorant, or both. Nobody in possession of all the facts and critical thinking skills would think this endeavour is a good idea

&gt;Sovereignty

The UK had a veto on all the EU laws, as well as several critical opt-outs. No issue with sovereignty

&gt;Immigration

The UK already has the right to refuse entry to non-EU nationals for any reason they like (they're not in Shenghen), and has the right to refuse EU nationals for a number of defined reasons (criminal record, economic prospect, etc). Other EU countries already conditionalize immigration from EU countries (Germany, for example, requires you to pass tests proving you can speak German, and get approval from the local administrative centre indicating you're suitable to live an work there).

&gt;Cost

Thanks to the negotiated rebates, the UK is pretty close to cost-neutral on it's EU commitments. The economic costs of Brexit have already vastly outweighed the cost of membership.

5483,"Yes. However, they are not successors. Both the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR) are legally identical with the German Empire. In fact this was one of the main reasons for a lot of tension between the two states.

In 1949 the western Allies officially ended their occupation and handed the western territories over to the German authorities. The German authorities founded the FRG. This sparked a lot of anger with the Soviet Union. The Soviets saw this move as a one-sided solution to the future of Germany and in turn declared the GDR on the East German territories.

The problem was that East Germany was not accepted as a legal country by West Germany. Exactly because of the reasoning that there can only be one successor of the German Empire. Both Germanies asserted an exclusive mandate on the whole of Germany. This was a bone of contention between the two German states for ca. 20 years, until both sides accepted that there would be two states from now on. Needless to say, that this was never really settled.

It has to be said that the root of this problem comes from the occupying powers, who issued every order and command not only for their respective occupied territory, but for the whole German Empire (including the territories, they didn't occupy). And especially the Soviet Union played a big role in this. For decades their position on whether Eastern Germany was annexed, sovereign, a successor or identical to the German Empire was extremely unclear. During the early decades after 1945, the Soviet Union was primarily focussed on minimizing the western influence in their occupied territories, while indoctrinating the people with the communist agenda.

This disparity had enormous consequences for the people of East and West Germany. Where people in the West had to suffer a brutal denazification program, and continued to deal and struggle with their Nazi past ever since, the people in the East were never confronted with their Nazi past. Offical GDR doctrine rather copied the Soviet doctrine and painted themselves as the victors over Nazi Germany, they didn't see a need for self-reflection. This of course was horribly wrong. The backlash of this can be seen today.

5553,"Yeah. Well some times the whole combat unit doesn't have 6 hours rest time all together. So no way does the driver gets it. If the unit stops digging in at previous position at midnight and assault maneuvers are to start at 05.00 next morning, then it is pretty literally impossible for the driver to have had 6 hours rest. Since the whole unit combined didn't get it.

Source: literally one of my exercise nights during battalion  exercise combat phase. Wasn't driver but a FO man.

Previous days operation ran long due to delays. So when we were done with digging in and securing positions at the goal point with tents up it was midnight. As per operations plans we were to commense next maneuvre along with rest of battallion at crack of dawn (ypu lnow to surprise the yellows in their tents or something). 

Most troops got barely hour or two sleep when counting in watches. Some guys pretty much none. They did what they could, drivers got released of watch to ensure maximum sleep (and of course some off the troop  moaned, not realizing  that driver was their only life insurance in the ultra safety featured (that is to mean none) bv 206 all terrain carrier next day. Still as said that was still barely 5 hours.

Often times in major maneuvres the point is to simulate real combat stress. So hey oh guys sleep near none for couple days  since nothing ever goes to plan and completes on time when say a whole company or battallion is pushing.

I would like to hear the low level platoon commandee telling battalion HQ 'half way to goal, stopping advance to goal to give drivers get their sleep'.

Then again the two hour sleep guys are slinging around magazines full of mumitions. It's blanks and smoke grenades instead of hard tips and frags, but its still explosive amd burning stuff, if not handled properly.

Not to mention it is interesting to do FO patrol on two hours of sleep and think if instead of HQ map simulations, real hardware would rain on the coordinates one just was part of measuring in half asleep.

Name one that has a market share even as big as the Chinese Weibo browser. I assume you don't do web development so you don't realize what a big deal Google has been to that field with their V8 engine.

&gt; Lol. No. Most browsers aren't written in C but rather in C++, which was developed by a Danish person.

I was referring to the JavaScript that is used on the actual webpages, not the browsers themselves.

&gt; Again, presumptious. If they're browsing on mobile devices they are almost certainly using a European based CPU; given that 95% of smartphones use ARM architecture; and 60% of mobile devices overall. 

ARM is a British company, and the brits are leaving the EU, and furthermore oten reject the label ""european"". And of course ARM is a specification, the actual chips most people will be using were designed by Qualcomm, an American company.

Also I think only 10% of EU MPs take part in any comission so if we leave another 20% to debate policies we can cut 70% of the MPs. An EU secretary makes €2600/month not taxed which is about twice the salary of a secretary in even richer countries. If we compare it to Eastern Europe no secretary should receive more than €1000/month. This starts from the secretary and goes to the very top. Pensions for EU burocrats are €65 billion which go up and up because these guys receive lifetime pensions even if they only worked for a few years which are also severely overpriced. To compare that, this is similar to the budget of the UK military for 1 year.  Moreover, there is no enforcable code of conduct in the EU parliament - there are pictures and videos of fucking drunk MPs in the parliament in session. Some MPs don't even bother going to work more than once a year. The EU is soo corrupt as an organization it puts all other governments for shame. Unless and until the EU organization fixes itself that money should come from it's budget. The Commission should be scaled to only obey the Council and should be paid as government employees not up to twice as much as the heads of state of the rich countries. The PM of UK is paid £140k while Junker is paid €300k even without including bonuses. A trip to Italy for 1 night cost him €30 000 (24 450 GBP).  EU pensions are f*cking 70% of their salary.

From the Guardian:

&gt;There is something to be said for their line of reasoning. One way or another, the Russian media has played a notable role in plunging Donbas into crisis: recall the inflammatory articles by Darya Aslamova, for instance. It is no accident that immediately after seizing the regional administration in Donetsk, the separatists took control of the TV towers.

&gt;You used to be able to defend Russian media in Ukraine by appealing to the need for pluralism but now, after Russian state TV presenter Dmitry Kiselev and his ilk broadcast stories about boys being crucified and slaves distributed among the national guard, that is no longer possible. What is more, the scale of the Russian propaganda campaign is exercising Nato and Kiev is obliged to support its western allies.

Most of the article was really just speculation, also a nice mention of your own country's free media:

&gt;There are fears, therefore, that the ministry of information policy is being created not so much to combat an external enemy as to suppress internal opposition. If that is indeed the case, Ukraine will drift off in the same direction as Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

Most of the article is speculation about the Ministry of Information Policy and the authoritarian regime that this 29 man ministry will create and enforce, but it didn't mention about any actual events for which the ministry was responsible. You are just a hypocrite, because whenever some Western article pops up about Russian involvement in Catalan separatism, people like you assume that it is speculation, but it is hard facts when the narrative is on your side.

A lot of modern architecture is made for the masses and is necessary to provide our large urban population with housing and work areas in the right quantity and quality, it just wouldn't be possible with older building techniques and forms. 

If we're comparing old towns of cities we shouldn't compare it with tower blocks and regular office buildings, but rather with the more expensive form driven modern architecture. That old architecture was only available to the wealthy, while the large masses of poor people lived in *really* low quality housing.

A lot of people prefer being tourists and perhaps living among old architecture, but if they had money to build anything they wanted would they then go classical or make modern houses? And which would look nicer? 

I've seen enough of those american mansions with columns that I think mass building in classical styles is not a fantastic idea, but then that is once again my subjective opinion.

5885,"Sceptics say single currency membership is more than an exercise in economic box-ticking


	

It’s a mark of the reversal in fortunes in the eurozone that talk in Brussels is turning to expanding membership of the single currency club. 

Having survived multiple Grexit threats and hauled itself out of a low-growth trap, the European Commission wants to welcome the euro outsiders in. Bulgaria is the chief candidate to make the euro-19 turn 20. 

Having met with Boyko Borisov, Bulgaria’s PM, in Brussels yesterday, Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker threw his weight behind the euro’s potential newest member state: “I have to say bluntly that Bulgaria is ready.” 

Brussels insiders are confident Bulgaria can make the grade and show the euro project is truly back on track. On paper, the country has plenty going for it. Its currency has been pegged to the euro since 1999 (ceding control over its exchange rate) and the government’s public finances are in healthy shape. At 29 per cent, Bulgaria's debt-to-GDP ratio is less than half the required criteria and its budget is in surplus by a Germanic 1.6 per cent. 

Mr Borissov, a member of the European centre-right family that includes Mr Juncker, has said his government will apply to join the ERM-2 exchange rate mechanism — the euro’s two-year mandatory waiting room by the end of the year.

But there’s a hitch. Outside the Berlaymont, there’s less enthusiasm to allow the EU’s poorest member state into the fold of economic and monetary union — considered the high watermark of European integration.

Sceptics note that euro membership should be more than an exercise in economic box-ticking. Bulgaria is ranked as the most corrupt country in the EU, according to Transparency International. By the commission’s own admission, the government’s biggest challenge is tackling high-level corruption and organised crime. Allowing Bulgaria into EMU (it only joined the EU a decade ago) would go against the grain amid mounting concerns over the rule of law from Poland to Malta. 

Talk over the Bulgarian candidacy also shines a light on the euro’s treaty obligations — known as the “Maastricht Criteria” — which no longer seem to match reality in a sprawling club of 28 member states. Drawn up in the 1990s, the pre-accession criteria focus almost exclusively on economic metrics rather than taking a broader view on a country’s institutional readiness outside its central bank’s independence.

A bigger problem for the commission is that the richer member states ripe for euro membership — Sweden and Denmark — don’t want in. The latter has a permanent and much-prized opt-out. 

Mr Juncker may well one day get his dream of a single currency for all. In the short term, that ambition might just come at a price.

Nor will it be clear that France would take immigrants it 'fails' to keep out of the UK back. 

I mean why would they? For most of Europe Brexit feels like a 'sod you guys we don't give a shit about you and your rules anyway', so the political sentiment tends to go towards reciprocating this.

Putin is a strong leader indeed. He actually did a lot for his country. He also did some bad stuff with crimea for example, and rampart corruption and extravagant black sea villas. While this kind of leader is accepted in most former communist countries it's not really a type of leader i look up to.

You said erdy boosted turkeys economy. I call bullshit on that. Turks were always big business and small business owners. Just from the top of my head i think we import a lot of small candy and a turkish company bought a big Romanian appliance manufacturer few years ago.
