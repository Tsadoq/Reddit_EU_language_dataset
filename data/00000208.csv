&gt; This means translated to easy language, it doesn't actually matter what was voted, the politicians don't actually need to do it.

9,"If you consult a history textbook, you'll see that the U.S. for most of its existence had no desire to be involved in European geopolitics. We were *compelled* to come to put an end to two World Wars (the first which Russia lost, and the second which Russia was unable to win on its own by Stalin's own admission), and then were asked to stay in order to maintain stability and defend against the spread of communism. If Russia chooses to interpret that as antagonism, that's their choice but it doesn't really make sense unless you define antagonism as preventing Russia from treating eastern Europe the way it used to prior to a bigger/stronger power arriving on the scene. We'll certainly plead guilty to that, and are proud of it.

As for the criticism of the Russian movements, its not about whether they have a right to move military assets wherever they want. Obviously they do. The question is whether it's helping the tensions there or exacerbating them. If Russia behaved like a normal country and didn't make moves like this which make its neighbors feel uneasy, the U.S. probably would have been asked to leave decades ago rather than being invited into ever more countries. You seem to consistently overlook that fact that we've been asked there, instead choosing to believe (inaccurately) that we've somehow imposed ourselves on unwilling hosts.

&gt; Do you believe?

It's not on their manifesto. If you have access to a higher form of knowledge, you should disclose it.

&gt; Economy

Never claimed it's the main driver. [Tourism] (https://www.statista.com/statistics/628849/tourism-total contribution ago/) still accounts for 14% of the Italian economy. Sizeably more in the South. 

We are not a resource exporter. We need to import energy and materials and transform them to add value before exporting back. Exit the Eurozone: pay in Euro, earn in Lira. And I don't have to explain to you what effect tariffs would have on that. Tailoring our monetary policy means devaluing. That's what we did in the past and that means stealing value directly from private savings. Unless you have your savings in Switzerland, that's not what you want for yourself.

&gt; Economists

Who? And it doesn't matter whether it was a mistake or not. We're in. Leaving means having to repay our increasing debts in Euro while earning in devaluing Lira, i.e. defaulting. I hope you have invested in gold.

237,"&gt; But I've been talking about history, and all you can say its shallow and I've picked moments that fit my worldview (which is basically how you build up an argument - if I was picking bits that didn't support my claim it would be pretty stupid).

What history? You made couple of moronic examples about HRE, XIX century's borders and about topography (never heard something more dumb. BTW do you even know that the Great Hungarian Plain is basically the westernmost extension of the Asiatic steppe? That's why nomadic ancestors of modern Hungarians settled there. So much for the Central European link I guess) after which you contradicted yourself with an example about Denmark, lol. Picking bits that contradict the hypothesis isn't stupid, it's objective, it's how you should proceed in order to get to a sensible conclusion. But you clearly know nothing about the relations between the two countries that date from middle ages. Starting with christening from the same latin rite, political links since Louis I and then the Jagiellon dynasty and later Stefan Batory, all of which caused vast cultural exchanges. You mention the Commonwealth as if it's an argument for Polish eastern links. Well it looks like that on the map, right? Ironically the Commonwealth was a time when Poland borrowed from Hungarian culture the most. Where do you think the famous Polish hussars came from? Or sabre the iconic weapon of Polish nobles. Back then the cultural flow was from west and south and we got most of it through Hungary. It didn't stop then either, Poland was part of the Habsburg Empire too and both nations shared struggles for the independence which resulted in common national heroes. You can hear all of it in folk music, see it in the folk costumes, taste it in the cuisine, and hear it in the language. This of course isn't any actual evidence, this is only to show you how much you didn't even take into consideration. I could show you lists of borrowed words or find papers talking about influences in music or the cuisine or the military, but I see no reason whatsoever to make that effort as you clearly don't care.

Man, the ignorance of the average person (not you) is infuriating. Refusing to give the EU more power and complaining about EU interference, all the while blaming the EU for not ending corruption and fixing national problems.

&gt;EU is unable or unwilling to check how the money are spent.

There is enough complaints and protests about EU interference in national government and states, if the EU dictated how states could spend their money, people would be furious.  


In addition, every state has different needs, some states need extra transport funding, others education, or healthcare. Should the EU have a general policy that states X% should be spent on education, and X% should be spent on infrastructure? The states have know better than the EU how best to allocate funds.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe

&gt;...Central Europe is the region comprising the central part of Europe. It is said to occupy continuous territory that are otherwise conventionally Eastern Europe and Western Europe.[2][3][4] The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity....

&gt;**Middle Ages and early modern era**[edit]
Elements of unity for Western and Central Europe were Roman Catholicism and Latin. However Eastern Europe, which remained Eastern Orthodox Christian, was the area of Graeco-Byzantine cultural influence; after the schism (1054), Eastern Europe developed cultural unity and resistance to the Western world (Catholic and Protestant) within the framework of Church Slavonic language and the Cyrillic alphabet.[18][19][20][21] 


&gt;According to Hungarian historian Jen≈ë Sz≈±cs, foundations of Central European history at the first millennium were in close connection with Western European development. He explained that between the 11th and 15th centuries not only Christianization and its cultural consequences were implemented, but well-defined social features emerged in Central Europe based on Western characteristics. The keyword of Western social development after millennium was the spread of liberties and autonomies in Western Europe. These phenomena appeared in the middle of the 13th century in Central European countries. There were self-governments of towns, counties and parliaments.[22] 
In 1335, under the rule of the King Charles I of Hungary, the castle of Visegr√°d, the seat of the Hungarian monarchs was the scene of the royal summit of the Kings of Poland, Bohemia and Hungary.[23] They agreed to cooperate closely in the field of politics and commerce, inspiring their late successors to launch a successful Central European initiative.[23] 
In the Middle Ages, countries in Central Europe adopted Magdeburg rights. 

&gt;**Following World War II**, large parts of Europe that were culturally and historically Western became part of the Eastern bloc. Czech author Milan Kundera (emigrant to France) thus wrote in 1984 about the ""Tragedy of Central Europe"" in the New York Review of Books.[41] Consequently, the English term Central Europe was increasingly applied only to the westernmost former Warsaw Pact countries (East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary) to specify them as communist states that were culturally tied to Western Europe.[42] This usage continued after the end of the Warsaw Pact when these countries started to undergo transition.

Europe is totally fine. We have more than enough arable land. I see North Africa and the Middle East as a much larger danger to us, geopolitically. These regions are already unstable and water problems might make the issues even worse in the future. We need a unified Europe to assert itself more and be a stabilising influence on these countries if we don't want millions and millions of more refugees flocking here in the future. We're still fighting amongst ourself like in the Middle Ages and our foreign policy is a total disaster. That's the EU's biggest problem.

Not to say that water isn't an issue in general of course. Like you say there are some minor causes for concern even in Sweden, and it's important that we make sure we farm sustainably. Don't want to end up with a situation like in Israel or California.

386,"In case you actually want to have a discussion on the matter instead of just being angry at the EU, I'll try to explain this the best I can as someone trained in law. The problem here isn't deciding the retirement age, Poland can decide any retirement age they want. The problem is applying the law retroactively which de facto translates into firing the judges of the Constitutional Court. That's what this is about. It's just a ""clever"" way to fire them, it has nothing to do with setting the retirement age, they can do that, as long as it doesn't apply to appointed judges, because as I said that basically means firing them on the whim of politicians.

Why that is not okay - it clearly flies in the face of an independent judiciary, as provided by Poland's own Constitution. If politicians can effectively fire judges then its obvious there isn't an independent judiciary, is it not? How can they be independent if they can just be fired indirectly by retroactively changing retirement ages or whater else their imagination conjures? It's an obviously unconstitutional law that effectively breaks the rule of law.

EDIT: That has a list of things which require supermajorities and what a supermajority is, but the important line is: ""Changes to constitutions, especially those with entrenched clauses, commonly require supermajority support in a legislature."" - I would argue that a choice like Leaving the EU is as important as a constitutional change to challenge the status quo. Of course, the argument against that would be that leaving the EU is a binary choice, and so a Binary majority vs minority vote would be the best course of action, but to my eyes a vote on the EU is something which could come out differently each time if we held 20 referenda in a row! So locking into place that it should be a supermajority seems the best course of action to my eyes. Alas, its too late now.

Take an American talking about his deployment to Germany. Is he going to talk about his ""American German airbase""? No, he's going to say ""I'll go to one of the German airbases"" or ""I'll be deployed at an airbase in Germany"". For an American audience the *American* is implicit, after all who else would own the base? 

News would be if it was a *German* German airbase. An *American* German airbase is the norm in that discussion which is why it would be omitted.

Translate those sentences into Chinese, ask a Chinese person who owns the base and he might not be able to decipher it based on the wording alone since he's lacking the cultural context *of an American in America talking about the American military*.

Analogue here: *Polnische Vernichtungslager* (in the context of WW2 and there can't be any other possible context) refers to (Nazi-)German death camps in occupied Poland. *Vernichtungslager in Polen* (which is the most used alternative in English that's considered to be okay apparently) means the exact same thing and is just as historically inaccurate.

Even better: It can have the exact same implication since it's not mentioned who ran the camp without more context.

The (historically) correct phrase would be the German equivalent to *(Nazi-)German death camps in occupied Poland*, that's what you'll find on e.g. the German wikipedia or within official documentations.

When it comes to daily language that's an entirely different story.

People often way underestimate what a true free trade actually means. Customs union is the term to use for actual free trade. You need to harmonize your standards, legislation, common tariffs for imported products etc and create a body that now keeps it all together and up to date with trade changing around the now one entity when it comes to trade. Free trade deals are contracts set in time.

496,"I don't see why its ignorant. 

Firstly, I'd say its definitely not arbitrary. Rivers, mountains, plains and other geological features have been used to divide areas for land for as long as humans have been cartographers or remotely aware of geography. And these geographic dividing lines also tend to divide nations and cultures. They have done for thousands of years. You could perhaps argue that *which* geographic dividing lines I have chosen are arbitrary, but I'd argue against that in my second point:

Secondly, culturally it seems like a pretty apt dividing line. Czechia was **entirely** within the borders of the Holy Roman Empire when it was Bohemia, and so was more involved in the central European politics of the HRE. Whereas Hungary would become deeply tied to Imperial Austria, and was already and Imperial power in its own right that exercised influence across other central European nations back then. 

Poland is not only geographically and historically distinct from the things that make up Central Europe, it is also culturally more distanced from Central Europe. Remind me, did the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth spread across central Europe, or Southern Europe? No. It expanded out eastwards. The nations that Polish history is most tied to are mostly eastern Nations and some central nations too. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this - you need to stop viewing ""Eastern Europe"" as a negative term when its just a geographic and historic one. Its quite racist of you.

Not really. If we decide to go out to eat, and are sitting in the car, before we both decide we'd rather just cook in instead and go back inside, that's a more democratic result, than forcing ourselves to go out for food.

It isn't like nothing has happened since the first vote, although yes, we haven't technically left yet.

&gt; Absolutely, but that doessnt mean you have a vote every single time that happens. That simply cannot work. Do you have new elections because poll results change a bit, especially before the new government starts governing, would that be democratic?

No, that would be insane, and again, nobody is proposing that. Elections happen regularly. Brexit is currently a decision that will impact the UK for decades, and is not a regular decision that can be changed easily.

In Czechia 38% said it's a good thing, 17% it's a bad thing and whopping 42% neither. At the same time 64% think we benefited from the EU.

If you look at the EU exit question, 47% would vote remain, 24% would vote leave, rest don't know. 

And lastly, the questions about the election show that there is an absolutely miserable interest in them - only 22%, which is the lowest by far.

So what I think is happening, is that people just don't have an opinion on the EU and they are very poorly educated on it. Our politicians have done an abysmal job of promoting the EU and explaining what it actually does. Instead they use it as a scapegoat. We also had an extremely euroskeptic president for 10 years, so that didn't help. And the current one isn't exactly super pro-EU either.

&gt; In such a scenario, it suggests sterling would fall by 12%, unemployment would rise by 520,000, average wages would fall by 2.8% and house prices would be hit by 10%.

Sterling did fall, and by 16%.

Apart from that he fucked up Poland by reducing religious tolerance, involving Poland in a fight for Swedish crown (which later led to Swedish deluge), and forbidding his son W≈Çadys≈Çaw 4 to change religion to become tzar of Russia (which later led to Russia partitioning Poland).

I don't view that as a comment on the democratic legitimacy, or not, of the European Union.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the European Union being larger than the nation state means it will have difficulties being truly representative, and intuitively understanding, of the peoples of the nation states which make up the European Union.

I do not personally believe that political unification of Europe, especially through a supranational treaty structure, is a goal worth pursuing.

No. The concept of decentralization is not ""every man for himself."" Think about it this way: is the *only* alternative to government breadlines the idea that every person must grow their own food? No, of course not! Instead we have multiple food providers that come and go with market preferences, and people buy and sell freely.

No, of course not. Gun centralization increases gun violence. Decentralizing it does not.

We're on the same page here.

I'm not advocating for no police. I'm advocating for market police, just as with the case of food like I mentioned above.

908,"**Translation:**

Facebook accepts sponsored messages with fake news that would appear on the platform on March 20, 2019, the day of the Provinciale Staten (Provincial Council) elections. Brandpunt+ planned ads with incorrect information about party leaders and polling stations via fake accounts. The majority was accepted.

An editor posted six sponsored messages. Three posts were aimed at making voters from VVD (conservative government party) or PvdA (socialist party) stay at home, for example through reports about closed polling stations. Fake news about party leaders from government parties was published in three other advertisements. The messages would be placed on the election day so as to influence the voting behavior as much as possible.

Facebook only refused a message about CDA (christian conservatives) leader Buma, who would upset the housing market to become rich himself. The message was not rejected due to incorrect information, but because it contained discriminatory texts. In an automatic message from the platform it was stated that if these would be removed, Facebook would post the message.

Messages about the leaders of ChristenUnie (Christian Democrats) and VVD were accepted: ""Gert-Jan Segers (Leader of Christen Unie) secretly converted to Islam"" and ""Rutte (Prime Minister) earns millions of abolishing dividend tax: secret stock portfolio"".

The editor could also post these messages about polling stations: ""Please note: the polling stations in your municipality are closed today! You can only vote tomorrow"" and ""Do not cycle through the rain to the polling station but just vote from home!""

The fact that Facebook does not refuse the ads probably means that they would come online on March 20th. It is unclear how long they would be seen afterwards. Facebook users can report ads, after which the platform might remove them.

The ads would cost between 2500 and 5000 euros and that would reach 418,000 to 728,000 people. Some of the messages would be specifically shown to people who are interested in certain parties.

Brandpunt+ pulled back the ads, because the editors do not want to distribute fake news themselves.

Research Facebook
According to Brandpunt+, Facebook says they take the issue ""very seriously"". The platform confirmed to NOS to be investigating the case. Facebook also points out they are taking measures to combat the spread of incorrect information.

Yesterday it was announced that the government is likely to set up a campaign against fake news in the run-up to the upcoming elections. Minister Ollongren wants to make citizens more aware of disinformation and fake news. For example, the campaign should explain why people get certain type of messages and others do not.

I chose to link this atricle instead of the article by Brandpunt+ because NOS is more to the point and easier to read, for the interested here is the link to the one by Brandpunt+

1044,"Flettner-Rotors are not used as the only means of propulsion, they only assist while still using the motors. You only use less fuel, but the amount saved very much depends on a lot of conditions, like windspeed and wind direction. There are problems too, among them for instance that it was really hard and complex to build and service these rotors when they were big tubes of steel and the speed of the rotation had to be controlled very carefully, sometimes even stopping the rotation and starting to rotate in the opposite direction. That's very hard to do with a heavy steel tube that has to be rotating at impressive speeds.

Saving fuel is a good thing, because for companies that means saving money. But if the extra cost of building a ship like that, servicing it and training your crew to use it correctly, is higher than the money saved by less fuel usage, it's not a way to save money anymore. And companies are about money first. So normal propulsion won and wind rotors weren't used.

The technology itself is nearly 100 years old but only recently have changes in how we can build big structures like those cylinders and from what material we can build them not only made it a lot cheaper to build these, but made them extremely more lightweight and stable. Todays Flettner-Rotors are build from glass- and carbon-fiber. They have become low maintanance, are controlled by software and because they are so much lighter it is a lot easier to just put them on existing, normal ships. You don't have to build ships specifically designed for them anymore.

That means having them and using them has become A LOT cheaper in the last decade. Also they have become more efficient because of all the automated systems controlling them and advances in how we design the surfaces.

So now they save you up to 25% fuel and costs are low... that means companies that use them, will save money, lots of money. This is the reason we are and will be seeing more and more of those in the near future.

The type of actions going on - the preaching of the vocalist/imam is absolutely the same. Its the way we perceive it that is different.
Religion ia not mandatory and I even believe that it is a state financed subculture that should finance itself and pay taxes but my point here is that it is not the religious what makes us concerned but its absolute otherness and the importanr status that the society has given it. Allow it to be something normal and you would see that in not more than 10 years (like in the 70ties in the US) it would be gone from the everyday life of people and they would perceive it as something old and unneeded.

&gt; It would be obviously unacceptable, if (like in communist Poland) - it was the political institution (like Ministry of Justice) that decided if judges can remain on their posts. Currently debated law gives that decision to National Council of Judiciary, which has constutitional task of defending independence of judiciary, and which members choosen in a way guaranteeing that mostly judges will decide fate of other judges.

PIS specifically did the first part (political institution decides which judges will remain - Ministry of Judiciary or President, depending on the version of law they tried to pass), and the second part (National Council of Judiciary was changed by them to have most of members choosen by the parliament and not judges - which makes it no longer independent of legislative and executive power).",Poland,/r/europe/comments/9pjpw3/court_of_justice_of_the_european_union_poland/e83wk1o/,ajuc,1540018761

According to it news Africa the fastest growing are the Tanzania with 7 %, Rwanda 5,9% (while overreaching the poverty reduction objective), Senegal 7%, Ivory coast 7%, Ghana 8% Ethiopia 10% Liberia 11,6%

Needless to say few other nations outside of Africa even get close to that, the US is crazy over it's 2,3 % and even China don't reach 7% anymore.

Pop growth: Tanzania 2,77% Ivory coast 1,88%, Ghana 2,18, Ethiopia 2,88%, Liberia 2,44%

Which is way below their growth rate

The fertility rate is declining all over the continent, however not as fast as expected
For example Rwanda had 8 children per women in the 70s, 5,7 in 2000 and 3,88 in 2016 the country is globally representative of the region.

**Article 180**

1) Judges shall not be removable.


2) Recall of a judge from office, suspension from office, transfer to another bench or position against his will, may only occur by virtue of a court judgment and only in those instances prescribed in statute.


3) A judge may be retired as a result of illness or infirmity which prevents him discharging the duties of his office. The procedure for doing so, as well as for appealing against such decision, shall be specified by statute.


4) A statute shall establish an age limit beyond which a judge shall proceed to retirement.


5) Where there has been a reorganization of the court system or changes to the boundaries of court districts, a judge may be allocated to another court or retired with maintenance of his full remuneration.

Poland has full control of the legislature it chooses to enact. If the government wants to change the statute that redefines the age limit, they can do so, and apply it retroactively, just like increasing the retirement limit also applies to current judges. 

Also, point #5 (which is an exception that overrules all preceding points in Article 180) states that a judge may be retired with maintenance of his full remuneration if there has been a reorganization of the court system. That's relatively ambiguous, but you can say that. ",,/r/europe/comments/9pjpw3/court_of_justice_of_the_european_union_poland/e83tjs7/,ollydzi,1540013567

They can't if you're not specifically monopolizing guns into the hands of one group like many advocate through the state. It's not like gun ownership has a natural tendency towards centralization if left to its own devices. Instead there are many people that get them.

&gt; You‚Äôll say other guys with the guns will stop them. Yea sure. Just like how it works with the cartels in mexico.

Cartels are violent precisely because their trade is prohibited from the state and not as a result of them being private or through the nature of their trade.

If let‚Äôs say there were no police, then medicine or alcohol companies would resort to violent tactics to defend their property/ turf.

1471,"&gt; You're phrasing those concerns as defensive in nature, as though they're worried that the U.S. will use its presence in eastern Europe as a base for conducting offensive actions in Russia. But then you're basically conceding that it's not a defensive concern, it's about wanting external influence in their near-abroad. So which is it?

What is there to concede, it is simply a fact that countries do not exist in isolation and they have to take into account interests of their neighbours. When sovereign Cuba decided to host Soviet missiles, what did US do? Did it respect Cuban decision, or did it send CIA to kill the leaders, imposed the blockade and continuously punished it economically to this date? We all know the answer to this question. 

Russia acts to maintain its security, when neighbouring nations make actions which might compromise it, Russia will react. And joining treaties which allow US to install military bases near Russian borders certainly compromise Russian security. 

&gt;Regarding the multipolar world, blah blah balh...

This paragraph is just your pure hubris. there is only one country out of 200+ which seeks global dominance. And it is the US.  Don't try and get the rest down to your level. So far China exhibited no desire to take that role, even countries like UK and France are much more willing to interfere in the politics of Middle East and Africa compared to China.

&gt;Finally, the global GDP, life expectancy, basically every conceivable metric of progress has skyrocketed post-WWII

Yeah, no shit, WWII was kinda a bummer...

&gt;Russia is lagging behind b/c

Yeah... Post WWII, the US was untouched, while most of the Soviet territory was scorched... Soviets managed to rebuild almost from zero, all the while supporting Eastern Europe and half of Africa. Even with that absolutely massive disadvantage, Soviets were able to compete with you in pretty much all scientific fields, thanks to massive advantages in equalises. While you still had segregation, and refused women to enter studies, Soviets build universities specifically to invite people from African countries to study and share the culture. 

Yes, there is a great period of peace, thanks to the Cold War, thanks to you keeping soviets in check and USSR keeping US in check. Unfortunately  that was gone for a couple of decades, and you've been back on your waring path. A few things changed over the decades though, the wars you start now are not balanced, so they are much shorter and officially not as many people die in them. But even though wars were quick, it doesn't mean that suffering stops. There are way more Iraqis died due to instability after your invasion then during your invasion, but that blood is still on your hands. Same with Libya. Yes, you only flown a few sorties, and armed rebels to kill leaders. But ensuing civil war, and the chaos which followed killed an order of magnitude more people, and the suffering their is still yet to stop, countless of refugees are dying trying to escape it, and countless of people are now sold as slave in the new global slave trade outpost which was created thanks to your actions. 

You are talking about ""good ideas"". And I'm not going to lie, a lot of the ideas coming from the US are good. You might not realise, but I sympathise with most of the ""American values"". They are good. Of course some of them are not actually your ideas, but rather communist ideas, like gender equality and racial equality. But nevertheless, those are great. Gay rights? Great. Free and fair elections? Awesome.  That is unless you understand that in countries like Iraq and Syria with free and fair elections you'll get people from the outskirts electing ISIS who will kill gays...

Progress takes time. You should understand it, it took you long enough to accept women and racial minorities as equals. Enforcing it through military power doesn't work. Education and cultural exchange does. This is what propelled our world to the place we are know, not US hegemony. And I really hope that you are wrong about 30 years more of it, as unfortunately that will mean more of  propping up abhorrent US ""allies"" like Saudis, of subjugating peoples like Palestinians, of destroying countries like Syria... 

There should be a counterweight to your destructive actions, even if it is just China. Bu fortunately, EU is finally breaking up from your dependence, Russia is making its word heard on the global stage and India is not far behind. So multi-polar world is what I would put my money on.

1566,"Let me state this in the beginning that most of your points concern that USA is at the forefreont whereas it is a mixed case for Europe.  
I agree with this sentiment. USA and UK have spearheaded most of the troubles in last 2-300 years. However, EU has benefited from their NATO led expeditions. I still see many of those countries involved in the damage, albeit to a lesser extent. You are free to disagree with me on this stand.  


Another of your point regards China, India and others having high absolute numbers. True. However, they always had historically high population (both these places, along with ME have been ancient river based civilizations). In case of India, for e.g. their Golden age was even before Islam happened.   
But their per capita emissions were always low. Most importantly, however, these places have practices that are inherently geared towards low life cycle assessment values. EU, otoh doesn't have such things inbuilt in their cultures based on my experience of living there. Heck, we had weird things like 'sustainability clubs' in my university in Europe. In Asia, this is part of their culture.  
So even if Europe has high productivity, the resource consumption is disproportionately higher.   


PLus nowadays, China is massively investing in renewable energy sources. Same goes for India. Again, USA plays spoil sport by putting road block in Indian solar development (To be fair, EU supported India there). Like I said, conflict! But energy is one of the resources. Theoretically, all energy resources can be traced to Sun, so there's sufficient leeway. But this can't be said about other resources such as metals, wood etc.   


Additionally, with income, birth rates have been declining in India with overall TFR around replacement rate. China already did earlier with one Child policy couple of decades ago. So, as prosperity increases, the growth rates with decrease and population stabilize. However, by virtue of initial mass, they will continue to remain relatively populated.  
No so long ago, China was considered a joke too. Give few more decades and your views about India and many other countries will change too. As I said, get used to change, because that is the only constant in life.   


This is what worries me. As China and India (giving examples of these as they are the two most populous countries) get rich, the demand of resources will increase. We only have one planet. You can imagine the rest. At least Chinese record of land grab is much better than West. So far we don't know of genocides Chinese did in Africa.   
You also have the options to try the extreme measures as we discussed. However, I find (continental) Europe to be too noble to commit this as compared to, say USA, UK or Australia. But who knows what happens. As I said before, if your neighborhood is in fire, you cant hope to remain safe for long. Desperate measures will be taken by both sides. In all of this, the vanilla based life in Europe will be a story of yesteryears. 

  
I'd suggest you read, if possible: 

For the games USA plays- Confessions of Economic Hitman by John perkins; and   
realities of current world order-  Drawing the global color line by Marilyn Lake.

I'd also stop as I can see our discussion isn't going anywhere. There's nothing I can do to change your view, much as you can to mine.

1770,"That was a Yugoslav military base you're talking about, which was fortified. Numbers don't mean too much when you don't have offensive weapons like tanks to attack a base with. We can only judge it by strategical goals accomplished: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ko%C5%A1are

Lol the agreement that was so beneficial to you, right? NATO did more damage to the KLA in that battle than it did to Serbs. It was by fact a KLA victory, as they secured the passage of arms and remained active without the Yugoslavs being able to repell them. 

1. The KLA attack a military base in order to have a clear point for passage of arms and other resources.
2. They fight back and forth for the military base eventually ending in a stalemate before the Kumanovo treaty. Stalemate had allowed for passage of resources for KLA, and was not able to be removed by the Yugoslav forces.

""The KLA sought to enter Kosovo from Albania and cut off of the communication routes of the Yugoslav Army, and also take over of the region of Metohija. After days of heavy fighting, the Yugoslav Army kept the KLA from advancing into Kosovo. KLA insurgents managed to take the Ko≈°are outpost following a massive artillery barrage by the Albanian Army and NATO airstrikes of Yugoslav strategic sites, but were unable to break the Yugoslav Army's second line of defense.""

KLA was on the ropes lol... Which Serbian tabloid told you this? This was the state of things nearing June, less than 3 weeks before the end of it https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/may/24/balkans3 
KLA had just had 67 own members killed by NATO in order for NATO to make themselves look ""neutral"", and still they were active. Quit making excuses, nothing changed from that point on until the Kumanovo treaty, regardless of what tabloids stated to make you feel better. 

How you manage to lose a fortified military base to lightly armed militants is a mystery to me, but you found a way.

Everything is so clear in hindsight, suddenly now Albanians knew how it would all end up and only did this because they knew that etc... You're scared, that's really why. KLA knew they were seen as terrorists but the facts on the ground changed that, since they mostly targeted military targets. NATO literally was aligned with you when KLA were seen as terrorists, in fact pretty much the whole world except Albanians were, but you couldn't keep the facade up long enough. The fact is Albanians in Kosovo rebelled even when they had everything against them, you're just making excuses now as to why you only talk on the internet.",,/r/europe/comments/9pclzl/kosovo_votes_to_create_national_army_over_serb/e82t4dg/,Arriveri,1539975045

If anything I have learned people who do so are quite pathetic, which is to be expected from someone who spends 10 years of his life on forums rambling about Caucaz Albanians. 

You are not very bright are you?

&gt;By far the highest rates of IBD within any populations is found between Albanian speakers‚Äîaround 90 ancestors from 0‚Äì500 ya, and around 600 ancestors from 500‚Äì1,500 ya (so high that we left them out of Figure 5; see Figure S12). Beyond 1,500 ya, the rates of IBD drop to levels typical for other populations in the eastern grouping.


AFAIK 1500 Years ago is 5th century, not 1150 ad, Canaris.

&gt;For instance, we could argue that the high degree of shared common ancestry among Albanian speakers was because most of these sampled originated from a small area rather than uniformly across Albania and Kosovo. However, this would not explain the high rate of IBD between Albanian speakers and neighboring populations.


Translated to dummy language : Albanians have been here for over thousands of years, but 1500 years ago they spread from a very small native group. This means that the reason we see very rare mentions of Albanians from 500 ad to 1150 ad is because they most likely hid in the mountains. For someone who claims to be Platos successor you are a horrible debater and reader Canaris. I guess unemployment has taken its toll on you.

It reads like a condemnation, right up until you get to the last paragraph and you realise that he thinks that this circumvention of democracy is a great thing.

Another great quote from him:

&gt;Public opinion will be led - without knowing it - to adopt the policies we would never dare present to them directly. All the earlier proposals will be in the new text, but will be hidden or disguised in some way.

Again, a scathing condemnation at face value, but he was and is pro-EU and pro-Lisbon.

It is a legit question because it's the ultimate conclusion to your ""everybody should stay where they are"" demand.

I grew up on both sides of the ""Iron Curtain"", much deeper than just the GDR. I've seen plenty enough of the human condition to know for a fact that we are all the same, just with slightly different flavors.

1980,"A) oh, the old ""defensive weapons"" and ""offensive weapons"" bullshit... Weapons are weapons, your ability to defend your self better also gives you an ability to easier attack someone. And vice versa.

B) Russia does peruse their claims legally, but legal claims could easily sidelined by military and political power. The US is in habit of doing just so. It is your political and military power which stops Palestinians from having their legal rights satisfied. And frankly talking about legal issues with an American is silly, your government understands only power, it will invade Hague before it would allow international judgements. It's the law in your country that the US should never allow international law to be applied to its military. 

C) Why not? That's what US does. That is the post cold war world that you've built. Invasions, regime changes, election manipulation... That's how you've decided that the world is going to run when there was no other country which could have said anything about it.

D) And I've attempted to break 100m sprint world record, I was off 10 seconds late. So what? Attempting to improve relations while disregarding all Russian concerns is doomed to fail. Russia doesn't want a rematch, Russia wants their concerns to be respected. 

E) They are more of friends then you and Turkey are allies. The reason that they are friends is that they cooperate where it is mutually benefit them and do not interfere in each other's affairs.

F) You are delusional, Syria is within striking distance of medium ranged missiles from Russia. Russia would easily overwhelm all of your forces there. Of course you could bring more carriers and more troops, but you fight too many wars, that would leave you too exposed. As of you not caring... Don't make me laugh, US spend a lot of it's political capital trying to influence events there, from UN to your domestic politics, Syria was one of your largest concerns. But you lost it, that's why the ""we don't care"" line came from.

G) It wasn't such an ordeal because they were powerful enough. You couldn't squash them, so you've tried to marginalize them and now it is clear that you've failed at that as well.  But it was an ordeal for everyone who didn't want to deal with you. Just look at the list of US military interventions post cold war. Your statement about ""Americans wanting peace"" is laughable. You've inserted your self in every conflict in the world, and you've created a some more. Your hegemony was brutal. You completely forgot how to negotiate, it was either your way, or your way with military. Now you start to learn it again.  Also, quite hilarious statement about your supervision of China... Sheer delusion of it is simply stunning.

Russia doesn't dislike you because you are ""greater"", you are not, you are a failing empire in their last convulsive thrashings, Russia (and pretty much the whole world) dislikes you because you think that you are special, that you know better then anyone what is good for everyone. Additionally you are arrogant enough to try and enforce your often stupid thoughts on the rest of world using force.

Apparently they had to estimate some numbers because in central Europe it is common to not register your hunting shotgun as a firearm. In Finland an unregistered firearm is taken seriously and they are only held by criminals who have worse sins on their conscience. 

The current official numbers of 1,6 million registered firearms would make the number approximately 29 per 100 population. The amount of unregistered firearms is estimated to be in the tens of thousands at maximum.

They grew accustomed to being a great power for the last 300 years and have not adjusted to the reality that they are now middling at best. Yes, they are rational enough to know they can't win in South America, but apparently irrational enough to think they can still win in the Middle East and Europe. The U.S. has multiple allies in Europe with larger GDPs than Russia, let alone the U.S. itself which could buy and sell Russia about a dozen times without exaggeration.

B) Putin would claim Russia is a democracy, so not sure why #SpreadingDemocracy would be treated as a threat. If we're going to get real though, we all know he's a dictator and that's why he's threatened by U.S. efforts to encourage a real opposition. There are plenty of democracies which elect people we don't like (see Duterte, Orbahn, etc.), but at least they are legitimate. 

C) I would reject the term ""boss around"" for how the U.S. treats the areas of Europe under its sphere of influence. The reason most countries willingly accept U.S. hegemony is that we typically don't abuse our power or try to extort our clients in the way Russia frequently does. Trump is challenging that norm somewhat, and the fact that everyone is so (rightly) shocked by it is testament to how unusual it is for an American president to behave that way. 

D) Russia isn't poor because of sanctions, it's poor because it's economy has been systematically pillaged by Putin and his oligarch friends over the last 20 years. There is no real economy and the country is basically reliant on oil profits to stay afloat, like the shitty dictatorships of the Middle East. Sanctions are just the icing on top, and the fact that Putin bitches about them so often is pretty good evidence that they're working. I'm sure he's doing fine personally, but his oligarch friends don't like that they can't vacation in the south of France anymore or that the FBI is snooping around their offshore bank accounts.

In the past 10 years your government has on average ran a budget deficit of 3% and it gets a lot worse if you look further in the past, since as far as statistics go, Italy has not had even one single year of surplus. The closest you got to one in the past 48 years was a ~1.46% deficit in 2007. How is that being fiscally responsible?       
I think there's probably a difference in perspective on what actually being fiscally conservative means because just implementing some cuts is not it. And what Italy has been doing isn't ""strong austerity"" either.       
My subjective outside perspective is that Italy seems to be plagued by political instability, corruption, inefficient public administration and lack of political will to actually implement needed fiscally responsible cuts and reforms because it would be political suicide.

2011,"&gt;You still haven't cited what examples you're referring to. I'm certainly not aware of any U.S. violations pertaining to the balance of power in eastern Europe, and that's the only kind of violation that would justify Russia's provocative behavior in that region. What the U.S. does in Iraq or Libya or wherever has no effect on the balance of power vis-a-vis Russia.

You could point at anything US does and you'd find them breaking international law.

Intervention in Libya is breaking the law. Intervention in Syria is breaking the international law. Any drone attack on foreign soil is breaking the international law. 

Recognizing the Israel embassy in Jerusalem is a violation of international law, that happened a few weeks ago.

&gt;The reality is that Putin, like other authoritarians, needed an external enemy to justify his level of power and the fact that he's been in power for 20 years, and America was that logical enemy. America has no interest in having a fight with Russia, and was perfectly ready to shift its focus to China -- a country with the resources to be a legit rival of the U.S. unlike Russia -- until Putin forced our hand by fucking with Ukraine and our elections. If Russia behaves, there need not be any tension, but I don't think they're capable of it. Conflict with the West is part of the Russian identity and always will be, no matter how irrational.

Riiight.

The advancement of the Ottoman Empire in Europe was stopped in 1593 on Croatian soil ([Battle of Sisak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sisak)), which could be in this sense regarded as a historical gate of European civilization. Nevertheless, the Muslim Ottoman Empire occupied part of Croatia from the 15th to the 19th centuries, and a large number of Croats [converted to Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Croatia). However, [Pope Leo X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_X) wasn't the first that gave Croatia such a title. The nobility of the southern Croatian regions sent a letter to [Pope Alexander VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI) and Roman-German emperor [Maximilian I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) on April 10, 1494 seeking help against the Ottoman attacks. In that letter Croatia was for the first time called bastion and a bulwark of Christianity:

&gt;*We have been blocking this force (Turks) for almost seventeen years wasting our bodies, lives and all of our goods, and like the bastion and a bulwark of Christianity we daily defend Christian countries, as much as it is humanly possible. That is why we are telling you this: If we get defeated by the Turks, then they might be able to remove Christianity from Croats.*[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antemurale_Christianitatis#cite_note-6)

When Turks [conquered Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople) in 1453, [Pope Callistus III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Callistus_III) urged all Christians to the [Crusades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades). Many Croats, led by Saint [John of Capistrano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Capistrano), were part of the army that defeated 150,000 Turks at the [Siege of Belgrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Belgrade_(1456)) in 1456. When [Belgrade was conquered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Belgrade_(1521)) by the Turks in 1521 many Croatian writers and diplomats pointed out dramatic situation stating that [Belgrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade) was *the bastion of Christianity, the key to Europe and the fortress of the entire* [*Kingdom of Hungary*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary)*.* In the following year, German Parliament in [Nuremberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg) called Croatia Zwingermaurer (Fortress) and the Austrian Archduke [Ferdinand of Habsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) said that ""chivalrous Christian nation of Croats is standing as a shield in front of [Styria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styria), [Carinthia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carinthia) and [Carniola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carniola), and the whole of [Central Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe) and Western Christendom."" At the session, Prince [Bernardin Frankopan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardin_Frankopan) asked for help, recalling that ""Croatia is a shield and door of Christianity"".  [Fran Krsto Frankopan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Frankopan) stated on July 1, 1523 in the memorial to the [Pope Adrian VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Adrian_VI) that Croatia is a ""bulwark or door of Christianity, and especially bordering countries of [Carinthia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carinthia), [Carniola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carniola), [Istria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istria), [Friuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friuli), and [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy)"".

2126,"&gt;As for Israel, Jews and Christians lived there for centuries before islam was even created.  the so called palestinians do not have have any claim to Israel.

What kind of argument is that? The indigenous people of a country do not have any right to the land in which they live? That's no different to saying to a Lebanese, an Egyptian or a Saudi that they have no right to the country in which they live.

Israel is ruling over millions of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza strip without giving them a right to vote or equal rights. How is that a liberal democracy and not apartheid? Honestly, Israel is resorting to [Stasi like methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca-C3voZwpM&amp;t=412s) to support its apartheid and occupation of the Palestinians. Even former [Israeli Prime Ministers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_the_apartheid_analogy#Government_responses) and [Jim Mattis have highlighted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Mattis#Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian_peace_process) that without a two-state solution, Israel faces becoming an apartheid state. Nobody questions the right of the Egyptians or the Jordanians to not be ruled over by another country, but somehow for Israel's supporters the status quo is acceptable and justifiable.

Even in the event of a ""final agreement"" which for many is *the best case scenario* to ending this apartheid situation, the Israelis are not interested in granting the Palestinians anywhere near the same level of sovereignty that Israel has. Netanyahu says the Palestinian state must be demilitarised, have no control over its borders, airspace or maritime waters. In effect, Israel sees a two-state solution as resulting in a Palestinian statelet with limited sovereignty that it ultimately rules over forever.

Then there is the fact that Israel continues to activity colonise the West Bank by building settlements for Jews (and Jews only) on Arab land in defiance of international law. That makes simply arriving at a final agreement even harder and renders the current apartheid situation even more entrenched. All the while Israel receives billions of dollars in military aid every year (in addition to the billions of dollars it previously gave in economic assistance) which finances this.

But hey, I'm sure your beloved Trump plus the establishment he's supposedly against will keep giving billions of dollars to support this apartheid and colonisation. ",√âire,/r/europe/comments/9owebd/bbc_news_us_moves_to_negotiate_trade_deals_with/e81yud8/,gamberro,1539945767

Nope. Don't you turn around aggressor and victim. Russia conducted insanely huge exercises since 2014 **without notifying OSCE**.

From the manufacturers page:
&gt;The key advantages of the Norsepower Rotor Sail Solution are:

&gt;Fuel costs¬†can be¬†reduced typically¬†by 5% to 20% without lowering the operating speed of the vessel.

&gt;Rotor Sail operation¬†is highly automated and it can be controlled by the¬†crew from the bridge.

&gt;The solution¬†has been¬†tested in co-operation with leading classification societies to ensure that it is robust, durable and safe to use.

&gt;Rotor sails can be¬†installed¬†in new vessels¬†or they can be¬†refitted to an existing ship.

&gt;The Norsepower Rotor Sail Solution is the first commercially available auxiliary wind propulsion solution with a proven track record of successful operation.

Arent they french as well? Or is the french citizenship just for show?

&gt;  Still shocked people say ""we need young people"" and rather than working on the hard part, like improving the gap between the number of children women actually want and the number they tend to have (biggest reasons for not having them being housing cost and wages), we just import foreigners further exacerbating the problem.

What you call ""hard part"" is just not a good idea. If people dont want to have kids, who are you to force them? At best, we can raise the financial aids and make parental leave easier but that comes with a heavy cost for a non significant result.

Is there a single developed country that has successfully significantly improved its birth rate? I dont think so.

2277,"If you care about the EU, it's time to start paying attention to the talk surrounding Italian finances. A worst-case scenario is pretty scary for the Union.

Full piece (but visit the site if you can):

&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell towards a two-month low on Friday after the European Union criticised Italy‚Äôs spending plans, raising fresh concern over conflict within the common currency zone.

&gt;Political wrangling over the budget in heavily indebted Italy has seen the euro weaken over 1 percent versus the dollar this week.

&gt;In the first step of a procedure that could end with Brussels rejecting the budget and fining Italy, the Commission sent Rome a letter on Thursday calling a draft budget an ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù breach of EU fiscal rules.

&gt;The single currency fell to an intra-day low of $1.1433 close to a two-month low of $1.1432 hit on October 9.

&gt;Italy is the third-largest economy of the 19-country euro zone, and a crisis there could unsettle the entire bloc.

&gt;The gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yields reached its widest in 5 1/2 years after news of the Commission letter broke.

&gt;‚ÄúThe euro is already suffering considerably now, and that would be worse if the crisis really gets going, [especially] as the dollar is now providing attractive yields,‚Äù said Ulrich Leuchtmann, a currency strategist at Commerzbank.

&gt;Analysts at MUFG said that if BTP yields moved notably higher ‚Äúcorrelations could well strengthen and this would provide further downside pressure for the euro‚Äù.

&gt;Investors have been pricing in the possibility that the tussle between Italy and the European Union will force the European Central Bank to be more cautious in removing stimulus.

&gt;Euro zone money markets are now not fully pricing in an interest rate rise from the ECB until October 2019. Earlier this week, they were projecting an increase next September.

&gt;The dollar index, a gauge of its value against major peers, was 0.2 percent higher at 96.091 on Friday, close to a two-month high of 96.155. The rise was driven by Thursday‚Äôs decline by the euro, which accounts for 57 percent of the index.

&gt;Meanwhile, the British pound rose after EU negotiator Michel Barnier said a Brexit deal with the United Kingdom was 90 percent done but that hurdles remained.

&gt;Sterling rose to a day‚Äôs high versus the dollar of $1.3038, trading broadly flat. It also strengthened 0.1 percent against the euro to 87.9 pence.

&gt;The Japanese yen weakened 0.23 percent versus the dollar on Friday, to trade at 112.48.

&gt;A global risk-off mood has prevailed this week amid tension between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, Italy‚Äôs budget woes and U.S-Sino trade conflict.

&gt;China‚Äôs economic growth in the third quarter slowed to 6.5 percent, its weakest since 2009 and below expectations, as a campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United States weighed on the economy.

&gt;The yuan changed hands at 6.9420 on Friday, trading down 0.1 percent versus the dollar, close to a two-month low.

&gt;‚ÄúExpectations have increased for the Chinese yuan to depreciate towards its psychological 7 level against the USD,‚Äù said Eugene Leow, rates strategist at DBS in a note.

I gave an example previously of how to define the real value of capital/labour in terms of value creation.

2475,"&gt;Then everything you said before this is not relevant.

On the contrary its very relevant, had Iraq not done these things between 1980-2003, The US would not have a problem with Iraq in the first place.What Iraq did was an inevitable part of the calculation for the US. If Iraq was a liberal democratic government it would not have done the things mentioned above nor would it have invaded and brutally occupied Kuwait in 1991, which very much was against the worlds interests. I think we can all agree Saddam controlling 1/3 of the worlds oil in 1991 was not something that could be allowed to occur.

The US generally doesn't need to warn democratic nations of putting at risk the US Hegemonic order set up post WW2. They generally follow the rules and do not annex territories and create colonial holdings, or practice imperialism.They generally do not take away the right to self determination. Even in the Iraq war of 2003 there was no question of annexation of Iraqi territory by the US nor was there any scenario where the US was planning a 200 year occupation like a British Raj in India.Nor was the US planning on creating a social hierarchy of control. Iraq was going to govern itself by the time we left and Iraq would have, for the first time I might add, the right to self determination and the giant bag of shit that entails.

Geopolitics is amoral...that does not mean killing Saddam was not a good thing, guy got what he deserved. It happens so rarely in this world it should be savored. If Saddam and the Baathist were moral actor there would have been no Iran-Iraq war, no Anfal Genocide, No Invasion of Kuwait, Iraq would never have even been on the US radar as a nation we wish to be hostile with. The events leading up too 2003 would never have occurred. As such it is not irrelevant it is in fact the opposite. You cant tug at this one string without everything else falling apart. 

As for it doing more harm than good for Iraq that will depend. If in 50 years Iraq were to remain a democracy and were to transform itself into another South Korea,Japan,Germany, or Panama then it might indeed be worth it.

By that same token if you had asked Americans a year after the revolutionary war if it was worth 70,000 dead and 9 years of war a little more then a third would have said ""No"". Of course we Americans living today are grateful they did revolt against the British. Its relative and will depend more on the future then today. We are still far to close to be able to answer these questions. Was it worth it? Was a generation of hardship worth a possible Democratic future? Will there be a better democratic Iraq because of this? we shall see. You could be right and its all not worth it, you could also be very very wrong. 

We in America were given a right to self determination because someone bleed for it in the past. Iraq is bleeding now for it. If in 50 years we see an Iraq that is free,prospering and democratic. Then I will argue the invasion of Iraq was not only justified it was the moral thing to do.

Remember amoral means a lack of moral sense, it does not mean there is no moral or immoral choice, just that it is not the only factor which a country can and cannot justify its will to act.

Usually will be about $10.5 a gram when you buy an ounce at once). Middle shelf which is usually about 50% of the stock offered is about $7 - $9 a gram, and low shelf which is about $4.5 - $7 a gram.

&gt; After the summit dinner Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel took advantage of the mild October evening to take a stroll from the Council building into the center of Brussels to the picturesque Grande Place -- a half-hour‚Äôs walk at a good pace without security details. They were joined by the prime ministers of Belgium and Luxembourg, Charles Michel and Xavier Bettel, at Le Roy d‚ÄôEspagne -- a Belgian brasserie famous among tourists for its beer and frites. Merkel had a glass of red wine (as did Michel, it appears). The Luxembourg leader footed the bill.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe had drinks with some colleagues last night, with beer and frites because we‚Äôre in Brussels,‚Äù Bettel told reporters. ‚ÄúIt was very agreeable. We are humans, and human relations are very important,‚Äù he said, adding that the leaders discussed the earlier meetings.

2831,"&gt; If this was true then you would see every place bustling with people making stuff everywhere.

No, because many things were considered luxuries back then. Medieval economy was agrarian, meaning that most people were working on the fields to produce food. Skilled craftsmen organized in guilds were something that mostly happened in big cities or at big castles. Because the ones who could afford such products were mostly members of mobility.

&gt; in that century there was enough supply that no one wanted to buy it

See, that is the problem: Yes, maybe sometimes there were good years in food production with a surplus, but this wasn't really reliable. Even with a huge surplus, most people in the middle ages couldn't afford imported food anyway.

Capitalism as a system started when innovations in the agrarian sector happened that helped to create a reliable surplus. This allowed for population growth, commodity goods and created the capital necessary. Coupled with the industrialization and mass-production, Capitalism began ‚Äì a system that is characterized by the private ownership of the means of production, not by serfdom and guilds. 

&gt; Romans literally run trade operations not only in roman empire but outside of rome.

Lol, first you bring up the East India trading company, now the Romans. Both of those things are NOT part of the middle ages.

Yes, Rome had a lot of trade. Rome also was an ancient empire that controlled all of the Mediterranean with a slave based economy. That is something totally different from medieval times.

Also, trade is not a sign for capitalism, unless you want to include the Soviet Union and its satellites as capitalist as well, because they also traded with the rest of the world.

&gt; Sorry mate but you don't know history.

Sorry dude, but I am not taking history lessons from someone who doesn't even know what Capitalism is.

&gt; Yes a lot of things they produced themselves but if you village have 12 people in it by definition it can't produce anything you can use daily outside of food.

Well, people back then did not need a lot for daily use. As I said, it was not a consumer society. What people needed most were tools for their work and livestock. Both of those things were necessary for their survival.

Also, 12 people, I would not count that as a village ‚Äì more like a hamlet/Weiler. Yes, 12 people is not enough, however if you have a 50 people, some of them can specialize on things like creating iron tools, creating clothing.",Germany/Hesse,/r/europe/comments/9p7f76/cumex_tax_scandal_cost_european_treasuries_55/e80sodw/,ibmthink,1539895486

Syrian doctors should cure the lack of medical attention

NEWSWed 29 Oct 2014

Syrian doctors should be educated in medical Swedish.

Thus, the V√§stra G√∂taland region wants to remedy the lack of medical attention.

In Sweden, the need for doctors is greater than the number available.¬†In V√§stra G√∂taland there are no more than 200 doctors, so a project has been launched to quickly train doctors from Syria seeking asylum in Sweden - they will learn medical Swedish,¬†reports Ekot¬†.

In parallel with the training, you also help transfer medical certificates to the Swedish system.

""It's a problem, for now I've been here for three months and I can not speak Swedish.¬†If I now have the opportunity to learn Swedish then it will be very, very ... you know, an incredible opportunity for me.¬†The best thing is if it is about medecine Swedish, says surgeon Hasan Bitar to Ekot.

An additional resource

In the V√§stra G√∂taland region around 40 Syrian doctors have been found at various refugee camps and they are now being trained.¬†And in V√§stra G√∂taland, there is a danger that it will be fast because the motivation of new arrivals is likely to ebb out.

""But when it does not happen then there is a risk that the motivation will be replaced by frustration and passivity in the end,"" says Ulla Ekstr√∂m, project manager in the V√§stra G√∂taland region.

The mother tongue of the Syrian doctors is seen as an extra resource as many patients also speak Arabic.

""SVT should have mentioned that only 0.3 percent of new arrivals have graduate education""published¬†June 5, 2015

SVT OPINION ARKIV ¬∑¬†""SVT paints the image that"" flows in the country, trained engineers, doctors and economists "".¬†It is manipulative to assume figures that include short vocational education, but make it clear that they are highly educated, ""wrote Tino Sanandaji on SVT Opinion in June 2015.

ABOUT THE¬†DEBATE

Tino Sanandaji

Researcher, PhD University of Chicago

The opinions in the post are the¬†debater's¬†own.

SVT¬†recently claimed¬†that more than every third Syrian refugee is highly educated, and painted the image of a skill rain.¬†The task is not correct and is based on a cumbersome definition of high education, where simple vocational training has also been included.

In Sweden,¬†however, highly educated college educates, someone with a few years of mechanical training in the Syrian military is not regarded as highly educated.¬†Today's¬†leadership page also¬†criticizes SVT's unreasonable definition of higher education.

It is unclear why SVT should at all try on its own estimates.¬†SCB already has detailed statistics on New Zealand education with the standard definition in Sweden.

According to¬†SCB¬†, approximately 10 percent of newly arrived occupationally-aged occupations are highly educated, compared with approximately 25 percent of the total population.¬†

Statistics SCB basically builds on self-reported surveys for new arrivals.¬†There is no benefit to exaggerate their education in a statistical survey, and experience indicates that most are honest.

The question of validation is a later step and separate from this.¬†It does not require either validation or documentation to be considered highly educated in the statistics, it is sufficient for self-reporting.¬†

The Employment Service also¬†collects data on New Zealand's education.¬†Instead of the standard definition, AMS reports its own definition of high education, including vocational training.

It is the AMS definition that SVT has used: ""With highly educated, we mean those who have stated that they have studied up to two years or longer than two years at post-secondary level""¬†¬†

However, the Ministry of Education¬†explains that ""all secondary education is not college education"".¬†Post-secondary education also includes easier vocational education.

Distinction is important because the Swedish labor market has historically only appreciated it later.¬†According to¬†SCB,¬†only 57 per cent of the occupants work with short post-secondary education.

Swedish employers do not consider a short vocational education as equivalent to a Master of Science degree.¬†

It is manipulative to assume figures that include short vocational education with the impression that these are highly educated.¬†SVT paints the image that ""inland flows streamed engineers, doctors and economists"".

How many doctors usually have two years of education?¬†In fact, only a few percent of newly arrived doctors and civil engineers are.¬†SVT writes in the same way: ""It rains skills across Sweden right now.¬†Study years, doctoral dissertations and heavy examinations "".

SVT should have mentioned that only 0.3 percent of new arrivals have¬†graduate education¬†.¬†

Refugees' education level¬†has only increased marginally in recent years.¬†It is strange that the employment agency's way of describing the same underlying numbers changed dramatically to describe approximately.

One reason may be that AMS is led by a new Director-General with a background as Social Democratic politician.¬†I have asked AMS how much of the new arrivals would be considered highly educated with SCB's definition and how many doctors.

Despite the publicity principle, the Authority refuses to disclose this information.¬†It is odd that the proportion of highly educated new arrivals has become a state secret.



It should be noted that sense then the social democrats have moved more to the right on immigration politics (barely imo) but it's no longer a viable strategy for the social democrats to try to push a ""highly educated"" narrative.

3193,"It's precisely that special flavor of americanised stupid and degenerate that drove down those results. 

For those of you that know, whenever there is something that the upper 1 % don't like, they tend top frame it in the context of war. Because that stirs up discussion. It prevents real change, because of course, the only people that are truely against agressive policies are the factions that are pro 1 %. 

The problem (in specific) was, the SPD was banking on the social name for quite a while. Kind of like the american democrats. Allways banking banking banking. Oh, and do you know how schroeder told bush to get fucked when it was iraq war time? remember this? Very european moment, wasn't it? Well, continue to vote SPD, and you'll see that. It's just around the corner. Now excuse me while I and the american deligate disappear around the tents corner, and ignore any gagging noises you hear, that is just my pride. 

The problem was, a good name, and a good heritage, actually only carry you so far. At some point, the people want to see actual results. Or, at least clear positioning. 

And this is exactly what happened. The support for the SPD was mostly due to an unspoken promise that they would do something for you, and since it has not arrived, and instead, since schroeder, taken a decisive anti worker stance, surprise, there are more then two parties there. After all, you don't have to be american in your policy system. 

And so, a couple of those voters from the SPD went over to the green party. Understandable, because the greens have this habit of actually demanding results. Results that are in general a result of party policy. actual accountability, not ""Jawohl, Merkel, wir folgen"". Set yourswelf your own goals, even if they are small and shitty ones, your progress will be measured by how you reach them. 

Now, the idea that this is somehow revolutionary is borderline retarded. It's the natural outcome of one too many broken promises, one too many deals of the great coalition that the people were stepped over, and one too many times the so called socials shat on the common worker in favor of the grand plan. 

We don't vote to keep a party in power, like the americans do. We vote to demand results. And if those results don't show, we could as well vote differently. Fuck what everyone else thinks. 

It was only natural after a big cioalition like CDU SPD that basically rubber stamped everything that the political goodwill would be this close to being used up. IF someone else claimed differently, ask them if the people have confirmed that they indeed wore their new clothes, or if there was just a whole bunch of nothing. 

I mean, just the idea to maybe, I don't know, do something about that.... Instead of wondering who maybe cheats with the wellfare, wonder who propagates a war outside your front door, and leaves you with the entirety of the cleanup bill, while going at this alone in the sense of profits. 

This is why the CSU still was highest. Because after the beer tent speech, where merkel said firmly that if the USA does no longer have our best in mind, we are not bound to the USA. And myaybe, we want to have some conversation too. 

You know, as the electorate. To for example have a talk about the EU east enlargement, and who exactly pressed for that. because in light ofthe constant american warfare in the middle east, and the permanent refugee crysis, it would be more then welcome to perhhaps lay every single expansion plan on ice. because clearly, we need the money for rthe refugees. we have no choice but to use huge chunks for them. Which leaves us none at all for eu east expansion. 

This, and many other reasons, like this, is why I voted for the greens.  Because they have been batting above their weight class constantly. 

It does not matter what they did, they were allways a fine player that bit off more then they should have been able to chew, and went with it. From dropping nuclerar energy, a few years ago basically a pip√ºe dream, but with the added subventions to renewable energies now a possibility. They bit off colossal pieces, and struggled a bit with them, but at a nice consistent pace, chewed through them. 

It is sad that they conrtinue to unabashedly have chatbots as political candidates, but hey, you can't have all winners. 

And this is the political climate with rthe social democrats elsewhere. Too little actual social, moo much of the democracy of making nice and offering compromise to everybody, and too little asking the voter base. 

And before anybody gets any stupid ideas: 

If you drop actual arguments and go for ""BUt, guys, you can't viote in actual nazis"", take a break and look how it went for the democrats in america when they dropped actual arguments in favor of ""at least we are not them"". 

Give me actual arguments, and I will defend you to the dying day. I will short circuit my liver debating policy against the AFD-regulars, will do battle against arch conservatives and leftists at the same time, and be the wall to bounce ideas off of.  I play ball as lonmg and as hard as I can, and I will troll the shit out of them for great progress. 

But the second you drop actual workable arguments, and go with, ""You can't vote for the far right, they are close to nazis"" as your argument, I will consider this an official notice of desertion in the face of the enemy, and will act accordingly. You can do pretty much anything else,. from group bungee jumping to buying gas from the franchise partners of the americans, have a karaoke night with the chinese, you can ask Putin for his reccipies for butterbrod and tea, I don't care. Just don't drop to the level of inbred americanised stupidity and go, the presence of actual fucking nazis is enough to guarantee that you will vote for us, we don't have to make promises. 

Untill then, consider this my official notice of warning. The greens are mildly annoying, but they are like terriers. They have a single track mind, and bark constantly, never ever running out of energy. They make that shit themself, in their backyard, if they have to. They get some shit done. It would nice to have a mixture of thjings, you know, greens and lets say CSU/CDU for the fiscal things, and SPD for the Social things. I would be on board in a minute. But if this pattern of idiocity continues, and we bow down to paid for writers demanding we vote for the status quo, ""because there are nazis"", I would firstly like to remind the writers that we have been bending over for a fucking long time, and now, we devellop spasms in the back that hint at the presence opf an actual factual spine (noone was more surprised then me), and secondly, look at the presidential election of america in 2016, and tell me what the moment where clinton declared half the american populace deplorable because they would not unite and vote for her meant for you. 

Even there, under the best of circumstances, it failed. Tells you something about that sort of thinking, doesn't it? 

Give me arguments why I should vote for you, and I will vote for you. Give me arguments that I should vote for you because you aren't them, and I will consider this cowardess in the face of the enemy and act accordingly. 

And untill you stand up and start giving me actual reasons to vote for you, I will gladly hand my vote to the green party, because they at least get shit done, and don't have to look to the american cock up their asses for permission.

&gt; The scheme yielded annual returns of 60 percent with zero financial risk. Frey insists that it was not the work of a handful of brilliant crooks. He says an entire industry was involved, consisting of hundreds of bankers, investors, tax advisors and lawyers spread out over continents.

It's not only similar to organised crime, it is organised crime. The only real difference is that they're less violent, because they operate under the implicit approval of the state. 

The thing that makes this almost impossible to fix is that it's not hundreds of bankers, it's literally the entire financial sector to one degree or another.

Why would anyone raise the capital for a business if they don't get any share in its profits? Then it's just money out the window. (Spoiler: they won't) 

More people have debt than have savings. Savings are rare because they represent unused resources/value and people who chose to sacrifice a bit of standard of living for hopes of future profits. People who have savings and are willing to risk them in a new business will most assuredly not be all the workers in the factory. Just giving them the whole production company is theft because it would have to be taken from the owner forcefully. And once the workers own the production it will be handicapped in its decision-making compared to any company with a owner and a hierarchy thereby also making it static and more vulnerable to new change and market conditions.

3290,"&gt;  Last week, I packed my books, my clothes and my teapot, boarded the Eurostar, and left the UK. It wasn't technically difficult, but mentally it was, because I doubt I will ever move back.
&gt; 
&gt; My impending departure was met with disbelief among my friends and relatives. For years before I moved here from France, London had been the ultimate goal: a lot of work went into mastering the basics of British life and politics, sounding British and ensuring my CV would be acceptable in the UK. When we discussed our futures at university, a friend once told me: ‚ÄúYou will be in London anyway‚Äù. 
&gt; 
&gt; The two and a half years since the EU referendum have felt like exile by a thousand pushes. On 24 June 2016, EU citizens living in the UK lost the ease of invisibility, of not standing out in the crowd. Suddenly, there was a seemingly never ending number of tiny worries ‚Äì what if people on the bus hear my accent and say something, what if I get questioned at customs ‚Äì that separated ‚Äúus‚Äù from the rest. Newspaper headlines, talk of ‚Äúbargaining chips‚Äù, and general uncertainty around the legal status of European nationals after March 2019: as badly as I had wanted to fit in, I became part of a group that was undeniably ‚Äúother‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt; Many EU citizens have already experienced Brexit-related incidents that shouldn't have happened ‚Äì there are job ads that demand a British passport now, and landlords less likely to rent to Europeans. The UK hasn't left the EU yet, but the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit deal has been just as trying (and, frankly, hurtful) for EU citizens.
&gt; 
&gt; I still love London and the UK. I did not want to leave. But what I thought would be, at least, a starting point ‚Äì the referendum result leading to a public debate on the EU and the UK‚Äôs future relationship ‚Äì turned into a competition over who would laugh it all off the loudest while saying absolutely nothing of substance. It took more than 500 days for the British government to guarantee some kind of rights to EU citizen. Europeans started leaving in droves while fewer are coming in.
&gt; 
&gt; With every day that brought a lack of progress, whether regarding EU citizens‚Äô rights or, you know, the possibility of not crashing out of the European Union, I got angrier. I felt gaslit and bullied by the country I had chosen to live in. And so I had to leave.
&gt; 
&gt; Today's UK is no longer the country I worked so hard to move to. It‚Äôs more divided by the day, and 29 March 2019 will not magically mend the country‚Äôs profound political anxieties. And I wonder: Who would want to remain in ‚Äì let alone move to ‚Äì a country engulfed in a political crisis so deep it has no end, or solution, in sight? A Western, developed country that spent the summer discussing whether stockpiling food was necessary, to the point that its government declared that ‚Äúthere would be no need for the army to be involved‚Äù? How did it come to this moment, when the unbelievably complex technicalities of Brexit, including unresolvable questions like the Irish border, are only discussed when time has almost run out?
&gt; 
&gt; I didn‚Äôt leave because I had to. I still have the right to live in the UK. I left because I‚Äôd had enough ‚Äì of the Brexiteers‚Äô total ignorance and rancid rivalities, of the jolly spirit in which one assumes all will be right while the UK is led to the brink of collapse, and of being called an ‚ÄúEU citizen‚Äù like it‚Äôs some kind of insult.

May would then get turfed out and replaced with a hard-Brexiter.

So either way the Tories will ultimately be the party of Leave, and so even if May herself wanted to Remain she knows her efforts are futile in that regard. The way she sees it, better to try to Leave now with Chequers or another fudge than in 5 years with no-deal, Boris Johnson at the helm, and having gone down as the Tory leader that allowed Jeremy Corbyn's socialists into power.

Philip Stafford in London

October 17, 2018

One of the US‚Äôs top regulators has threatened to stop European banks from using US futures markets if the EU refuses to water down post-Brexit plans to oversee clearing houses.

Christopher Giancarlo, head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said on Wednesday that EU plans ‚Äî ostensibly in response to the UK‚Äôs move to leave the EU ‚Äî were ‚Äúcompletely irresponsible‚Äù and could be met with a stern reaction from Washington.

‚ÄúThese are blunt and strong tools,‚Äù Mr Giancarlo said, acknowledging that it could have a serious impact on global markets. ‚ÄúNone of these options represent a course of action that I wish to pursue.‚Äù

Mr Giancarlo‚Äôs fierce warning comes as UK authorities try to remove tensions with the EU around the issue of clearing as the UK‚Äôs departure from the bloc nears.

If a resolution could not be found, he warned the CFTC could unilaterally take its own action ‚Äî including barring EU banks from using critical US infrastructure such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

The CME is widely used by banks around the world to hedge their exposures to dollar swaps and US Treasuries. It could also bar US institutions from EU entities such as Deutsche B√∂rse‚Äôs Eurex, which trades futures pegged to the prices of German government bonds.

The industry at the heart of global market stability has become a political battleground between authorities. Clearing houses are important backstops in financial markets, managing the risk if either side on a derivative transaction ‚Äî a company or a bank ‚Äî defaults.

The City of London is the leading global player in the trading and clearing of derivatives, including 90 per cent of euro-denominated swaps. To compensate for the UK‚Äôs departure from the EU, Brussels wants to equip their regulators with more direct oversight of London clearers.

The European Commission‚Äôs package of reforms relating to clearing houses are slowly working their way through the Brussels legislative pipeline, with member states divided over the implications of centralising oversight.

The US and UK have a common cause in resisting European plans for extensive oversight, with both sides supporting ‚Äúdeference‚Äù to local regulators, with close co-operation.

While no breakthrough is imminent in the negotiations, the US has increased pressure due to progress being made that has potential implications for non-EU clearing houses.

The latest warnings from Washington fit a pattern of turbulent US-EU talks over the regulation of clearing houses. While both sides have threatened potentially dire consequences for markets, the disputes have typically been resolved amicably.

Mr Giancarlo has long argued for the EU to rethink its plans, arguing they could also be applied to US markets. In his strongest warning so far he said the plans were ‚Äúwholly unacceptable‚Äù.

US market participants would be in the ‚Äúcompletely untenable position of having to choose between violating domestic laws and regulations or violating foreign laws and regulations‚Äù, he told a derivatives conference in Chicago.",England,/r/europe/comments/9p84e5/us_threatens_to_bar_eu_banks_from_exchanges/e7zoxeu/,Azlan82,1539859654

3513,"PREP stands for pre-exposure prophalaxis . The marketed brand name is Truvada, its basically the same medication as someone who has HIV would take . However, they discovered that if taken daily it can be very effective in preventing transmission of HIV in the person who is taking it.

Currently it is offered to gay men on the NHS in the UK for free as long as you meet some criteria. 


1. You are HIV negative and get a test

2. You have had sex without condoms with 2 or more men in the last 3 months and intend to do so, or you have an HIV+ partner with a detectable viral load. 


3. you are willing to submit to sexual health screening every three months to confirm you are HIV- and pick up anything else you might have gotten by having sex with more than one partner without using condoms.


Otherwise you can just buy it online, its about ¬£60 for a three month supply. However, a recent court ruling overturned the patent of the Truvada brand name, potentially allowing the NHS to supply much cheaper non branded versions of the drug, which means they might be able to offer it to all gay men soon, without the need to prove eligibility and its also a dumb system right now because it encourages risky behaviour, or you to lie about risky behaviour in order to get free prep. 


There also exists PEP, which stands for post-exposure prophalaxis. which is given as an emergency medication to gay men or someone who thinks they have just had unprotected sex with someone who is HIV+ , or really if your concerned about anyone who you have had unprotected sex with you can get it. However it only works if you get it within a maximum of 72 hours, but is best taken within 24 hours, and ideally as soon after the encounter as possible.  Its the same blue pill Truvada as PREP once a day, but there is also a red pill twice a day to take in addition that I cant remember the name of right now.  PEP is a 28 day course. PEP can also interfere with a HIV test so if you go on PEP you generally need to wait 3 months after you finish your course to get tested for HIV and to be sure your all clear is genuine.  PEP can cause some tummy issues in a very minor number of cases. But most people experience no side effects

Both PEP and PREP should be taken with food. 


I have been on both, went from PEP and just continued with PREP. They do monitor urine samples to test kidney function as PREP can cause some impairment in your kidneys, but this has been in a tiny, tiny number of cases and after people have been taking it for years.


Also , if you choose , instead of taking it daily, you can also take PREP in whats called event based. Basically you need to know 24 hours in advance that you are going to have sex, which is not the most practical thing in the world, but say you have some kind of gay bar event where you think you might want to whore it up a little. You take 2 PREP tablets 24 hours before you are going to get busy, 1 right after you do the dirty, then 1 a day for 2 days after that, if you have more sex then you just keep taking 1 a day until 2 days after the last time you got giggy with it.

3526,"When we get right down to it, all we need is clean water and food and shelter, so we should only fund agriculture schools and vocational training for mining, wood harvesting, and blacksmithing. And the mints, of course. People want to study math? Fine, but with their money! Those are hobbies, we don't need to hire professors, assistants, etc. to boil water or grind grain. We don't need math to know when the hopper is full!

Anyways, I studied physics at university, and read philosophy as a hobby. I'm very confident in claiming that most physicists are absolutely worthless as philosophers. Absolutely worthless. The difference is so staggering that such a claim that physcists are superior philosophers can only come from unread hubris and a fundamental ignorance of the content.

You appear to have this strange worldview as if society is this immediately apparant thing and that those who approach it na√Øvely will somehow produce superior results. How would a mathematician be superior to a sociologist in social explication (especially a specialised mathematical/computational sociologist) if that mathematician has no concept of social organisation? If we replaced 'sociologist' with 'banker', would you claim the same thing? Social problems are multidimensional. How would the mathematician know how to model and solve the problem without sociological methodology and experience with its nuances? And of course, these models are theory laden. What premises are the mathematicians importing, are they purely received? Isn't that just giving priority to whatever the orthodox dogma currently is and calling it objective? I'm telling you right now, what you're advocating for is uncritical and mindless. Don't you see that your argument is itself replicating your implicit ideologies? You haven't escaped from anything.

I completely reject your design for the purpose of education. Technical experts have their place, but lobotomising society of intellectuals of the humanities because you personally have no appreciation for the scope and nature of their work would be an extreme disservice to the public sphere. Is the purpose of education to mass produce workers for the labour pool? Here, I can tell you that this is pure ideology. I prefer the useless liberal education where people read broadly across many subjects and cultivate themselves, growing as independent political and social beings.

A: A Russia that must keep it's aggression limited because otherwise it would lose the money coming in via natural gas and oil sales.

B: A Russia that is bankrupt and but doesn't need to worry about economic fallout in case it starts a war.

I obviously say B, and B will most likely happen either way in the future (due to the transition to renewable energy) so right now i would say, play ball and keep Putin feed, but we seriously need to start investing in our defense capabilities now.

Just throw away all of your moral values (this is really important when we talk about potential war, as we can't be certain what moral values Putin has) and consider the simple cost and benefit of military action. Attacking Poland or the Baltic states would only add more landmass to Russia, which it has more than enough of. There are no worthwhile resources to plunder, yet right now it would cost Russia all of its foreign business with the EU.

But if there was no business to the EU, and Russia was in a deep financial hole, military actions taken against the EU might be worthwhile for Putin, as war boosts nationalism and patriotism, while Putin doesn't care a single bit about dead soldiers, he wants to stay in power. 

And if Putin had the choice between a possible revolution that would remove him from power because the people's lifes are going to the shitter or a war with neighbors that he could spin as ""we are under attack"" or ""it's only so bad because of the EU"", you and i both know what Putin would do.

3623,"&gt; We are talking about greece and serbia from 1912 not after the WWI. If they were able to defeat the Ottomans using only their armies and the navy then they would have done it without Bulgaria as an ally.

What are you talking about? Why would they have excluded Bulgaria that doesn't make any sense, also it was originally the Bulgarians and Serbians who formed the leauge, Greece joined later. The Greeks were sought after I should mention for their Navy in the first place. 

&gt; British authorities? Or all authorities. And ones that are not pro-greek. Because you are repeating the greek propaganda. The Bulgarians did take part in the conflict so they know from first hand what exactly happened.


British historians are superior to your local historians. This is just a fact, they have far more good faith and neutrality, better education and everything. Also these aren't Brits, Erickson is an American and usually has pro-turkish leanings if anything. Also what do you mean pro-greek? Just because after analysing the facts and details they come to a conclusion that isn't inlign with your nationalist narrative doesn't make them ""pro-greek"" 

 

However I will admit I am pro-Greek. I like Greece. One of my favourite countries in Europe.  

&gt; Sources? Not greek ones

You are the one who needs to show sources, it is your claim originally

&gt; A century later there are Bulgarians only in Pirin Macedonia and Eastern Albania. In Vardar Macedonia and northern greece there are only Macedonians and greeks. Where did the Bulgarians go and why? How would you define the depopulation of a specific ethnic group from a given region if not an ethnic cleansing. 

The Hellenisation of Macedonia occured after the Balkan Wars, was sped up by the settlement of Anatolian refugees in the interwar period, the population exchange with Bulgaria and finalised after the Greek civil war in the aftermath of WW2.

We are talking about the 1st Balkan War. 


&gt; Of course the greeks cannot compare to the ethnic cleansings performed by the british. That is a whole new level - a global one. Maybe that is why you claim that the greeks did not perform much war crimes - they just cannot compare with the brits so it is nothing in your eyes.

Is it possible to avoid an emotionally charged discussion where you bring up my country of origin despite it's irrelevance to the topic? 


&gt; Uhhh, what? Did these Ottoman troops just disappear in the air? No, the Ottoman reinforcements were sent to the front line but not to the Western but to the Eastern one and were faced mainly by the Bulgarians. So I am not sure who exactly the greeks eliminated.


No but they were immobilised. This was 20th century Anatolia mate, they didn't have the roads and infrastructure they have today, moving armies wasn't that easy, and no they didn't go to the eastern front, most of them  never made it to the Balkans 


&gt; Yes, of course the main credit goes to Bulgaria.

That's your opinion.  One I believe is more derived from your nationalism than respect for what happened. ",United Kingdomer currently teaching in the U.S ,/r/europe/comments/9ovpu1/on_this_day_in_1912_bulgaria_greece_and_serbia/e7zd6oj/,TheBritishHistorian,1539838426

Business as usual means your country being driven into the ground by the EU.

It doesn't have to mean that at all. The EU negotiating position has one aim, namely, to discourage any other member country from leaving even if that is to the detriment of, not only, the member that is leaving but its current members.

&gt;It's not an increase in fear. People are looking at wtf is happening and realising they don't want anything to do with it.

There was a rumor that the city fell to Prussian hands by bribes to Jewish merchants who wanted to preserve their quarter from Prussian bombardment. Austria lost Silesia, and was overall weakened after this war, and the empress blamed Jews for it. This created a series of law from which Jews were banned, expelled from cities, and forced to relocate to Poland or were required to pay ""acceptance"" tax. Since the majority had lost their property, a few could afford to pay this tax. Many Jews delayed the expulsion and settled in countryside.

3725,"Maybe the idea of a feudal nation-state had something to do with it? In Spain, say, you were a subject of the Spanish king and you were supposed to do as the king says. When you insist on following different customs, religion, not integrating with the rest of the nation, you are incompatible with the feudal nation-state order. You get thrown out. Does this make sense? If, say, a bunch of Germans settled in Spain and would not integrate or want to become Spanish, they would be thrown out too. So maybe it wasn‚Äôt because of who they where but because of how they were?

The stupid usury laws that applied to Catholics but did not apply to non Catholics also didn‚Äôt help. If lending money on interest is a sin, that means, it offends God, why let Jews do it? Is God not offended when non Catholics do it? These contradictions lead to a lot of tension and distortions. Another one was 10% church tax on Catholic merchants. But no church tax on non Catholic merchants? If you are subject to such a tax disadvantage, how do you compete? You try to get your competition thrown out or you‚Äôll slowly lose your livelihood due to a constant competitive disadvantage caused by the 10% church tax.

3864,"&gt; they don't come in with any actual data and like philosphy it usually comes down to what your ideology is and what you are trying to push. 

Well they usually have data, it's just shit most of the time and the interpretations are often absurd. 

&gt; And in regards to nationalism, what do you think is so inherently wrong with it. 

That really depends on your definition of nationalism, I guess. I don't think it's inherently bad. 

There is nothing wrong with loving your country, the people inside your country, with wanting to make your country to be the best place in the world where everybody is happier than elsewhere. But nationalism should always be about the future a place could have, not the past it had. 

There is nothing lower than than teaching kids history and telling them how proud they should be to be born in a certain place. To debate on whetever certain people where part of the nation or not, whetever certain place-names are derived from your language or another one. 

This kind of nationalism is divise and makes people proud of things they have little to do with. 

&gt; And don't come at me with the Nazi nonsense, That's your people's problem.

This ""Germans dislike Nationalism because Nazi"" trope is something that non-germans propagate. Nobody dislikes nationalism because he feels bad about the Nazis or anything like that, that's just a meme.

&gt;Yes, reality has a left leaning bias. Science especially, because it depends on freedom and progression. You still didn't explain what gender studies did to those universities.

Freedom and progression does not depend on the left leaning bias but saying so, does exactly what's happening in those universities. Every individual who is not supporting the left leaning wing, gets his own discriminating label as... Nazi? Trump supporter? Misogynist? Homophobe? i digress... point is the wave of the gender identity has come to the point of either you accept it or you're an enemy, which is dangerous. 


&gt;What you describe as ""blowing up"" is a major exaggeration.

it describes it perfectly. 


&gt;How?

because gender identity of third + genders hasn't been scientifically proven, but it is still being accepted and implemented in the law and by implementing it in the law it has become an Ideology.

This set of options -- conversion to the local dominant religion, exile, or death -- was a common one in regions that banned Jews.

Re ""ethnically Jewish people"", yes and no. Ethnically Jewish people who converted to Christianity under one of these kinds of bans were frequently still regarded with suspicion, and Spain's concern with ""limpieza de sangre"" (purity/cleanliness of blood) certainly indicates they weren't only concerned with Judaism as a religion. But in a great many of these places, conversion to Judaism from another religion was also illegal and often punishable by death for both the convert and the sponsoring clergy.

&gt; How, exactly, does one go about changing something as complex and distributed as culture? On this point, the history of formerly lagging ethnic groups is instructive. Whether measured by rates of alcoholism, high school graduation, or income, Irish-Americans used to lag far behind other American ethnic groups.23¬†As one point of reference, the incarceration rate for Irish-Americans was five times higher than for German-Americans in 1904. The response? While some Irish leaders blamed society, others, notably those in the Catholic Church, launched an inward-looking campaign to change behavioral patterns within the Irish community.24¬†Similar efforts were made by acculturated German-American Jews, whose stern programs of assimilation for their less-cultured Eastern European co-religionists included giving them ‚Äúpointed lessons on the use of soap and water,‚Äù according to Sowell.25

4091,"Yes, basically everyone is dressed up during the six days of street carnival (the ones that don't like this kind of dressing up usually just flee the Rhineland to go on holiday somewhere else during that time) and during the whole carnival season (starting every year on 11.11. at 11:11 and ending the year after at ash wednesday) there's meetings called Sitzungen on nearly every weekend where people go dressed up as well. I'm guessing this picture was taking at such a Sitzung.

""normal people"" just dress up in whatever they want - Clowns, Cowboys, Indians, Musketeers, Bees and whatever traditional or non-traditional costume you can imagine. But for people in high-ranking positions in the carnival organization or politicians etc. the Narrenkappe plus the medals they got from the carnival clubs and maybe a funny shirt are usually the preferred way to dress up. It's like a more official form of costume that's still supposed to be funny. (you can see that he actually has the coat of arms of Bonn on his cap)

First, as you may have noticed from Europe's present response to Muslims, people are not too keen on people from another competing religion being present *en masse*.

Second, Christianity, for a long time, banned lending money for interest ‚Äî this was [usury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury).  Since then, it's been mostly redefined to ""lending at an *extortionate* rate of interest"", and Islam still mostly does the older ""no interest"" thing.

This meant that Jews were the ones who could lend money.  And so they entered into this finance vacuum.

I remember furious people in the financial crisis saying that they wished that ""all bankers could be killed"".  Now imagine that it's a less-cosmopolitan and more-violent time, that the bankers all belong to some other religion and are more-or-less in their own tribe, and tend to all live together and not much marry outsiders.  You've got a population willing to see that group getting whacked.

Oppressing Koreans from receiving a comprehensive education and leaving them with huge gap in qualified teachers, the Japanese left Korea with a 78% illiteracy rate in 1945. Due to its Confucian cultural influence, Koreans highly valued education and began to work on various reforms to build up a literate population. The Basic Education Law in 1949 and then the national strategic plan with a focus on education reforms in 1962 created compulsory education for children from elementary and middle school (Sorensen, 1994). By 1970, the literacy had gone up from 22% in 1945 to 87.6%. This progress did not stop, and now Korea has a literacy rate of 97.9%; breaking this percentage down further, 99.2% of males and 96.6% of females are literate.

Yes, I understand the logic: Bulgarian articles-&gt; Bias. But they state their own sources in the articles and further justify the written claims with historical background.

&gt; People around Tran (–¢—Ä—ä–Ω) say ""–º–ª–µ–∫–æ"" like in Serbia, not ""–º–ª—è–∫–æ"", like in standard Bulgarian... 100 years ago, there were many Serbian komita's in that area who fought for Serbian side...

The Bulgarian dialect spectrum ranges from e to —è (–º–ª–µ–∫–æ-–º–ª—è–∫–æ, –¥–µ–¥–æ-–¥—è–¥–æ) and from —ä to a/—É (–≤—ä–ª–∫-–≤—É–∫, —Å—ä–º-—Å—É–º). A variable e/ya isn't a trace of influence from Serbian, it's a [part of the Bulgarian language itself](https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/–Ø—Ç–æ–≤–∞_–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞). The e usage is dominant in the Western Bulgarian dialects while ya in the Eastern, nothing big about it and yet [past Serbian linguist take this as proof](https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/–à–∞—Ç–æ–≤–∞_–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞#/media/File:Balkan_dialects_belic_1914.jpg) to mark those Bulgarians as Serbs to further Serbian 19th and 20th century agenda. What mostly separates the Serbian and Bulgarian languages is the grammar (especially the case system) and the extensive use of –Ω—å, –ª—å, –¥–∂ –∏ —á—å, that is not dominant in Bulgarian. There were also many Bulgarians in Southeaster Serbia that fought for the Bulgarian side..

I personally have lived in Serbia for 3 years, great place with great people, I like the Serbs, but history is best avoided. The main reason I started this discussion is because Serbians have left an impression on me that they are taught that the baddies Bulgarians invaded Serbia for giggles during the wars and committed crimes for no reason than just to spread their terror while staying ignorant of their own state's crimes during the early 20th century, especially Alexandar I Karadjordjevic. We despise our Tsar Ferdinand I (the tsar that rules during WW1), he was exiled for his bad doings and Bulgaria paid a huge price after 1918, while the Karadjordjevic family is praised in Serbia and the inclusion of Vardar Macedonia into Serbia is seen as a unification of rightful Serbians lands, which leaves a bad impression on the Bulgarian public.",Bulgaria / –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è,/r/europe/comments/9ovpu1/on_this_day_in_1912_bulgaria_greece_and_serbia/e7xzrti/,Corvus_2,1539794386

4380,"&gt; Yes, because of the incoming troops from Asia Minor and the successful operations of the Ottoman navy in the Black Sea.

Yes as I mentioned from Erikson the Ottoman army was growing stronger there by the day.

&gt; Do you think serbia and greece could win the war without Bulgaria? 

Perhaps, yes actually. Would be a much tougher war. I think a combined Greco-Serbian front where the brunt of their armies pushed towards the struma against the Ottomans, along with the Greek fleet still could have won the war. Hard to say

&gt; and actually neither Bulgaria could win without them

I agree, if the Greek fleet wasn't involved I don't see how that would be possible 

&gt; Yes, a serbian force did take part in the fall of Odrin. That does not mean that the main credit for the fall should go to serbia. The Bulgarian army was the most numerous, with the best equipment, and took the heaviest casualties from the four Balkan countries. Do you think serbia and greece could win the war without Bulgaria? No, and actually neither Bulgaria could win without them but let us not forget that the greeks were defeated by the Ottomans 16 years earlier. Stating that the main credit should go to greece because they took advantage over the Ottoman navy weakened by the Italians is just not true.

You are  completely contradicting your original statement 

&gt; Agreed. While Bulgarians were busy fighting the Turks, greeks and serbs were busy doing what they do best - ethnic cleansing.

You originally stated basically that Serbia and Greece did nothing during the war, I was simply putting forward an argument against that 

&gt; Stating that the main credit should go to greece because they took advantage over the Ottoman navy weakened by the Italians is just not true.

4410,"&gt;Why would it be?

Because at this point, ""gender studies"" is an internet meme mocked by many. 

Don't get me wrong. I am very happy and proud that my country is very progressive, one of the best places in the world to be born a woman or LGBT+. 

I genuinely believe that the ""soft"" and social sciences are important, and they deserve funding and prestige. 

But: 

1) Gender studies in particukar is a joke. Sure, there is people in there doing useful/interesting stuff, but many are doing bullshit things. Things that can not be taken seriously by anyone not in the field and which can not be labeled ""science"" in any way shape or form. 

2) The natural sciences improve the economy and the material well-being of the population. More investment there means better industry and knowledge-based economy in the future: the only way we can have a strong and resilient economy instead of our bullshit tourism economy. 

3) The natural sciences require long-term investment and planning, because they cost much more money per useful researcher. A historian will keep doing their job mostly without trouble as long as they get paid, a biologist not so much because they need lab equipment and that lab equipment needs continuous improvement to keep the research competitive. Hence, long-term and stable funding is more important to the natural sciences. 

Again, don't get me wrong. I am a feminist, I support the LGBT+ movement and so on. But gender studies is not a priority for me at all. Culture and social sciences should be properly funded too, but ""proper funding"" for them might mean 1% GDP while for the natural sciences it is 2-3% GDP and said spending must be sustained in the long-term.

4424,"&gt;FWIW, I would class a typical Brexiteer view being the single market being the best thing about the EU, but not worth having full access if it means a losing political sovereignty.

That's pretty much the most common view I've come across, essentially the idea of the single market is generally seen as positive, but obviously the more integrated the market, the more necessary it is for there to be a collective pooling of competencies that impact not only the single market, but also necessarily the domestic market (as part of the single market..), which is itself much larger than the share of exports and imports across the EEA, and then also external trade relations.  In short, that wonderfully efficient internal market comes at a cost.

&gt;Additionally, I'd say that Brexiteers are very aware that the single market has been developed fully for goods which benefits nations like Germany, but for services which the UK economy is a leader in, progress towards developing a single market has pedantically been held up by France and Germany.

Also true, indeed there is a relatively simple argument that the EU disproportionately benefits Germany as a major exporter of goods (with the Euro discounting German currency and EU providing labour and markets), and France as a an agricultural power (with CAP providing support for producers and external tariffs restricting cheaper imports.). At the same time the UK sees a far more modest benefit, and faces restrictions on services, and cannot make the most of global trade as EU members need to restrict that to protect their own industries (take cheep steel for example, the UK produces hardly any, but uses a lot, it'd better off being able to buy dumped Chinese steel at low prices, than propped up German steel..). 

&gt;Not only does its abysmal design pose a near existential risk to global financial markets, but it is driving inequality and unemployment and fuelling the rise of the far right. Additionally, its structural faults (which Brexiteers ranted and raved about in the past) dominate the EU agenda.

I think there is  a bigger issue there actually, and it cuts somewhat to the core of the EU political project. Essentially the EU is happy to push as far forward as it can, leaving issues that it will solve 'later'. That is true for the Euro (as seen since the financial crisis), its true for Schengen (as seen with the issues around refugees and border protection) and its true on a smaller scale in a while slew of areas.  Using a crisis to push integration, often without public support but on the basis that 'something must be done now', and on occasion while putting massive pressure on a single member state to comply in the midst of a crisis, is not a great way of moving the project forward. 

&gt;I'd say theres very much a view that it is inevitable that it will collapse in the next 10-20 years, unless there is the type of centralisation of the EU that makes UK membership unattractive, and better to take the pain now and diversify the UK economy away from the EU as much as possible until that point.

I'm not sure about a collapse (more that it will lurch from crisis to crisis without reform), but I'd agree with the rest. ",,/r/europe/comments/9oppu9/lse_brexit_just_how_wrong_is_the_brexiteer_view/e7xjds9/,ajehals,1539780064

4465,"&gt;It isn't. Illiteracy is not the same as not recognizing logos, brands and short words. The brain is immensely powerful at recognizing patterns.

&gt;There's also a third distinction that must be made. When I lived in Montreal there was a campaign surveying language comprehension and 50% of inhabitants on the island were deemed illiterate in French. That didn't mean 50% were unable to communicate in French, it just meant they didn't meet criteria. What Quebec meant by illiteracy here was how well the inhabitant knew French to function in society.

These are fair points regarding the illiteracy thing. Although if she does not recognize the AfD logo then I would put it in the ""does not know them"" category I said above. And if she speaks German but is not classed as ""literate"" by whoever does the statistics, then the point is moot because she would then be able to read ""AfD"". 

&gt;Besides, in the case for immigrants most immigrants are simply illiterate of roman letters, those illiterate as a whole are a small minority. This distinction is immensely important because a lot of people really seem to think all 3rd world immigrants are completely illiterate. 

As for this, I know. It's just that, sure, maybe she can't read Goethe in the original text or so on, but I would expect her to at least know a but of German since she has been (apparently) for several years here. I would be very surprised if she had heard of AfD and did not know those three letters.

4491,"&gt;Hitler wouldn't have run for power if he didn't felt betrayed by the leading powers after WW1, that isn't denying Germany's role in WW2.

That's more because of the [Stab-in-the-back myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_myth) than anything else. Many Germans felt that they were far from defeated and that they were betrayed by the civilian government.

&gt;If there is a single country on earth with a healthy self-reflection, it's fucking Germany.

As long as they know their history, yeah.

&gt;It's funny how you blame Germany for doing exactly what all the other powers did

Why is Germany absolved from blame just because the other powers wanted to go to war as well? Russia helping Serbia was due to established treaties, Germany deliberately stirring the pot was not in any established treaty.

&gt;nevermind that it was still Austria-Hungary that had the dispute with Serbia, not Germany. 

And they felt emboldened because they knew they could do anything they wanted and Germany would have their back. If Germany had warned Austria to be cautious they might not have been so confident in attacking Serbia.

&gt;Seems like you just want to take the easy route and blame Germany like the victors did.

Now who's putting words in someone's mouth? I'm not interested in Nazi apologetics and easily debunked myths.

4529,"&gt;The assassination of Franz Ferdinand is widely regarded as the indirect cause of WW1, that was in no way or form Germany's fault.

No, but Germany saying to Austria-Hungary ""Do whatever you want to Serbia, we'll back you up even if it means outright war with the other great powers."" was their fault. They had a pretty big hand in escalating the conflict, with Wilhelm II trying to put the genie back in the bottle only when it was far too late.


&gt;It is very clear that Germany did not want a war. 

Pretty much every nation involved in WW1 had something to gain from going to war, Serbia might have been one of the few nations with no inclination of going to war and that was only because they knew they were going to get trashed.

&gt;It was though, as Germany wasn't the starter and comparing treaties makes no sense when looking at this one specifically.

It absolutely does. They are very similar.

&gt;Germany's biggest industrial area was occupied, a ridiculously high amount of war reparations were demanded (that Germany paid back until 2010!) and like 1/5th of the country got annexed which cut off East Prussia from the rest of Germany.

Sounds an awful lot like the treaty of Brest Litovsk (Which saw Russia losing a significant amount of its land, population and industry with added reparations on top) and the Franco-Prussian War where France was basically occupied for years in order to facilitate war reparations that France could ill afford.

Germany also ceased paying reperations in 1931, having paid only a fraction of the amount they were supposed to. They started paying them again after WW2, without resorting to electing racist fuckwads while only possessing half of the country. The final twenty years of payments were pretty much interest that they only had to pay in case they unified again. It amounted to 125 million Euro's.

&gt;On top of that Germany was declared as the sole aggressor.

Of the losing powers Germany was pretty much the only one that hadn't completely fallen apart. I definitely agree that they weren't the sole aggressors but world leaders at the time put much of the blame on German Jingoism, which is not wholly unfounded.

&gt; I would like to have seen the reaction if the same would've been done to the US or the UK.

They'd have to be on the losing side of a World War first, never mind twice.

&gt;Deny it all you want, from the German perspective it was absolutely too harsh (nevermind Germany only surrender ed under the terms of the 14 points by Wilson) and brought us Hitler.

The German people can't absolve themselves of blame that easily. The German economy was well on its way to recovery by the time the Nazis took over.

Suppose you think mass immigration is a bad idea, because you think it brings conflict and endangers the welfare state.

So you suppress your thought or reframe it in some extremely mild way so that you couldn't be taken for a Nazi.

4538,"To me, the wealth of a country is not really determined by the purchasing power of people in the country, but by how productive people are in that country. In the end, that is the underlying factor that determines the development of a country. And that is more closely related with nominal GDP than with PPP-adjusted GDP. 

Trying to measure wealth in terms of PPP-adjusted GDP also leads to the paradox, that a country might grow its productive capacity, but not grow its PPP-adjusted GDP, if it coincides with growth in wages and therefore in the cost of non-traded services. But would you really say a country hasn't gotten richer in that scenario?

And you can have similar paradox if consumer preferences changing with income. For instance, if as people get richer they go from spending most of their money on rent (a non-traded service), to spending more on clothes and electronics (traded goods) or on travel, then again, that would show up negatively in PPP-adjusted statistics.

The fact that you are believer means nothing in this discussion, i am myself atheist. Granted, he is my countryman, i may not bother defending him if he wasnt, even if i still though that attacking him is unjust.

Still, i am first to admit i am wrong when presented with proof, as you can imagine as atheist i am not that attached to vatican or clergy in general. The only thing i wish for, is a proof that he willingly saved at least 2 pedophiles by for example moving them to different country or infuencing higher ups. Why 2? i consider one such case of moving priest to different country might be coincidence. 2 might be unforgiveable mistake imo and it is enough for me.

Sending everyone back to the other side of the world is costing a lot of money, It is not the practical thing to do.

I am not for immigration, or against it, I just think we need to uphold our commitment to international treaties. Sending people back is cumbersome and complicated. In my opinion we should stop them in the Sahel.

4613,"Not op but I can answer it to you. It's local crime. 
  
  
Breaking down the statistics, you can see that regions that have crossed around 7% of immigration tend to be very anti-immigrants, and those that haven't, tend to be pro-immigration.
  
  
This is related with small crimes, such as a friend got his wallet stolen, another was mugged the other month, etc, and the feeling you can't walk around on the street without having to be aware of your surroundings.
  
  
This is the to say ""migrants are committing robberies"", it is to say that the way current governments are moving the migrants is creating ghettos, combining with a higher unemployment rate and fewer opportunities, and it is a bad combination.
  
  
It's also been seen that on the flip side, when these same communities of migrants instead of being all lumped up in a ghetto, instead are spread across the region and with appropriate efforts to integrate them, local population tend to be quite happy with their presence.
  
  
Once again, while the problem can be summed up as ""it's the migrants fault"", the issue is more complex and it is much more related with how they are being inserted in society by the government.
  
  
If you break down the statistics of who is pro and anti immigration, you can see a very strong correlation with that 7% of immigrants in the region.
  
  
I can give you an anecdotal example, the high school I went to was right next to a big Gypsy ghetto (an apartment complex built by the local government and given to the gypsy community). 
  
In school, although the kids were friends with the gypsy kids, it was a running joke that if you met 1 one them outside of school, and if he had at the least 3 times more friends with him than you did, you should get your wallet and phone ready, he would be mugging you. Sometimes he would even return your things the next day in school, social pressure I guess.
  
Since the complex was built, walking around at night was a big no-no, unless you wanted to be mugged. Every kid in school, over the years period got mugged sooner or later, myself included. 
  
Whenever I speak with my old high school friends, almost every one of them are very prejudicial against the gypsy community. Thinking of them as not much more than thugs that live on social benefits.
However, when I speak with friends from my university, that didn't live in a similar condition, their view on the gypsy community is the polar opposite. 
  
  
Personally I don't believe my experiences then reflected gypsy community culture any more than how a ghetto system, in which people are grouped together and isolated from society (a non-gypsy going in that neighborhood was a big no-no) is the recipe for conflict. Creating a society within society. 
  
Today I can see how my high school friends are among those that are voting for anti-immigration and university friends for pro-immigration. Both would be screaming at each other over this political topic, all because both side are more concerned about being the ""good guy"" as opposed to understanding the views of their fellow.

4658,"BERLIN‚ÄîOn a rainy morning in a cemetery last month, Berlin‚Äôs hidden underworld briefly emerged from the shadows.

Nidal Rabih, one of the German capital‚Äôs most notorious criminals, had been killed by unidentified shooters days earlier, and his funeral drew nearly 2,000 mourners from across the country. Scores of police officers watched as bearded, beefy men in tracksuits and crew cuts filed by. Older men were ferried to the graveside in luxury cars with dark-tinted windows.

At 36, Mr. Rabih, a gang enforcer, had spent a third of his life in jail. He was taking a stroll with his wife and three young children when he was shot eight times next to an ice-cream truck in a Berlin park.

Security officials say the slaying was the latest escalation in a gangland war involving some of the country‚Äôs most powerful gangs. Recent months have seen a rise in killings, shootouts, and attacks on property connected to the gangs. But for law-enforcement authorities in Berlin and around the country, Mr. Rabih‚Äôs killing was the last straw, prompting a intensified crackdown on crime syndicates, police officials and prosecutors say. Raids, arrests and indictments have ramped up in recent weeks.

‚ÄúA broad-daylight murder in a popular park packed with families is a whole new category,‚Äù said Martin Pallgen, spokesman of Berlin‚Äôs interior ministry.

The violence‚Äîand the authorities‚Äô pushback‚Äîhave drawn attention to Germany‚Äôs burgeoning ethnic crime clans. Security officials, politicians and researchers say these groups represent an immediate security concern as well as a warning about what can happen when migrants fail to integrate into their host societies.

In the 1980s, thousands of Arabs and Kurds from Lebanon and parts of Turkey sought asylum in Germany. Unlike guest workers invited to the country, these often stateless people weren‚Äôt allowed to work, instead receiving basic benefits and in many cases not integrating into their new society.

According to a 2017 study of organized crime by Germany‚Äôs equivalent of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, some of the families stuck by tribal and Islamic codes of justice, spurning the state and its laws. Insulated from society, governed by their own rules and hierarchies, several such families turned into criminal enterprises, the study found.

Today, about a dozen predominantly Arab and Kurdish families with an estimated 1,000 criminal members dominate the German capital‚Äôs organized-crime scene, according to police. The vast majority of these families‚Äô members, like Germany‚Äôs immigrant population in general, aren‚Äôt involved in crime.

There are parts of the country, however, where they appear to play a disproportionately large role in offenses. In the Berlin district of Neuk√∂lln, a blue-collar but rapidly gentrifying community that is home to several criminal clans and a burgeoning avant-garde club scene, 151 people aged between 13 and 21 were registered in 2015 as serious repeat offenders, according to internal police statistics seen by The Wall Street Journal. More than 53% of them had an Arab background, whereas people of Arab origin make up about 10% of Neuk√∂lln‚Äôs 330,000 inhabitants.

Outside Berlin, criminal families with Arab and Kurdish roots have established branches in the Rhineland, Lower Saxony and the northern city of Bremen, according to Martin Steltner, a Berlin prosecutor.

Officially, most prominent Berlin clan members live off state benefits, authorities say, but their empires span illegal activities from prostitution to fueling the city‚Äôs booming party industry with drugs. More recently, the families have branched into legal ventures, including property, gambling, fitness studios and restaurants, says Martin Hikel, the mayor of Neuk√∂lln.

Since the 2015 refugee crisis that saw nearly two million mostly Middle Eastern asylum seekers enter Germany, the clans have been recruiting young refugees to act mainly as street-level drug dealers, said Mr. Hikel, a member of the center-left Social Democratic Party. Immigration has also brought new competitors, including Chechen groups notorious for their brutality.

‚ÄúThe clans have systematically been recruiting refugees for the dirtiest jobs, such as selling drugs in parks and the subway,‚Äù said Thomas Spaniel, an organized crime expert with Berlin‚Äôs criminal police.

Refugees and asylum seekers make up only about 2% of Germany‚Äôs 82 million strong population but 8.5% of all crime suspects in 2017, according to police statistics. They made up 14% of suspects for unlawful killing and assault, and a similar proportion of robbery suspects.

As part of the nation-wide push against criminal clans, police on Wednesday launched a vast operation in Berlin and the surrounding region, searching 19 properties linked to a Chechen crime ring. The previous day, investigators shut down a drug-selling operation in the capital led by two Lebanese citizens, confiscating three kilograms of heroin and a large amount of cash.

In perhaps the most spectacular recent raid, Berlin authorities in July seized 77 apartments owned by members of the Remmo family who were officially living off welfare.

Issa Remmo, the family‚Äôs 51-year-old patriarch, arrived from Lebanon in the 1980s as a refugee and has 15 siblings and 13 children in Germany. One of his sons is currently on trial for the murder of a rival family member, who was beaten to death with baseball bats. Another relative served an eight-year sentence for robbing a savings bank; the ‚Ç¨9.8 million ($11.3 million) loot was never recovered.

In a rare interview, Mr. Remmo told a local newspaper in July that he knew nothing of the seized properties. ‚ÄúConstruction and gastronomy‚Äìthis is my business,‚Äù Mr. Remmo told the BZ newspaper. A lawyer for Mr. Remmo‚Äôs family didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.

As Mr. Remmo and his relatives attended Mr. Rabih‚Äôs funeral, an imam urged the unruly crowd to stop shouting, refrain from altercations with police and observe Islamic rites. A small group of veiled women stood separately.

‚ÄúOnly pigs, not men, would massacre a father in front of his children,‚Äù said one mourner who gave his name as Sami and his age as 42. ‚ÄúThey will pay.‚Äù

Sami, who said he had shared a prison cell with Mr. Rabih, said new gangs were disturbing Berlin‚Äôs criminal equilibrium. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs like New York here: Chechens, Kurds, Albanians, Russians, Moroccans, Turks, Gypsies,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEveryone wants their share.‚Äù

Strong religious and ethnic identities have helped families from Lebanon ward off outside scrutiny and enforce loyalty, according to Ralph Ghadban, a German-Lebanese scholar who wrote a book about the criminal clans.

‚ÄúThe clans see our liberal democratic society as something to be plundered. Yet even discussing crime and ethnicity was off-limits until recently,‚Äù said Mr. Ghadban, who blames political correctness for the failure of authorities to dismantle the ethnic gangs.

Mr. Hikel, Neuk√∂lln‚Äôs mayor, said authorities had allowed the clans to establish a parallel society that rejects German norms and values, initiate children into crime from an early age and encourage intermarriage to strengthen cohesion and accumulate wealth.

‚ÄúNow we are at a tipping point,‚Äù Mr. Hikel said. ‚ÄúThey are heavily armed‚Ä¶and they have amassed wealth‚Äîwe need to stop them before they legalize it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have literally ignored these people for 30 years and now we have a huge problem on our hands,‚Äù the mayor added.

Recently some families have expanded into legitimate areas, including the music business. Bushido, a major rap star of Tunisian origin, was until recently managed by a member of the Abu Chaker family, one member of which was convicted in connection with a spectacular 2010 attack and robbery on a poker tournament in a luxury Berlin hotel; the stolen prize money of more than ‚Ç¨200,000 was never recovered.

In an interview last month, Bushido said he had broken ties with his former business partner following violent quarrels. The rapper said he has since switched allegiance to a member of a rival family: the Neuk√∂lln clan of Mr. Remmo.

The clans have even made into popular culture. A fictional Arab crime family is the star of the TV series ‚Äú4 Blocks,‚Äù which originally aired on the TNT Serie channel and is now available for streaming through Amazon around the world. Critics have compared the show to ‚ÄúThe Sopranos.‚Äù

Notoriety feeds more of the same. ‚ÄúKids see the gangsters driving Mercedeses and sporting Rolexes. They want to be like them,‚Äù said Hamed Khamis, a former gang member turned author. Anti-Semitism, homophobia and misogyny are promoted as values, he added.

Better integration and tougher policing can only do so much. Many police officials complain that Germany‚Äôs justice system is ill-equipped to tame the gangs.

‚ÄúIf we find ‚Ç¨100,000 on a gangster officially living off benefits we need to prove he earned it with crime, and that‚Äôs difficult,‚Äù said Benjamin Jendro, spokesman for the GdP police union. ‚ÄúHis Porsche or his house are registered in the name of an aunt in Lebanon. Even when they get convicted they get out in a couple of years. It‚Äôs frustrating.‚Äù

A recent law that reverses the burden of proof in some cases‚Äîforcing suspects to justify the origin of dubious funds and property‚Äîhas in practice only very rarely been used by courts.

Cash purchases of real estate and other big-ticket items are legal in Germany‚Äîan avenue the finance ministry said in a 2016 study was being used to launder some ‚Ç¨100 billion of dirty money in the country each year. Germany‚Äôs federal system and poor communication between government departments impedes investigations, Mr. Jendro said.

‚ÄúWe are have been na√Øve. They bought businesses and properties with suitcases full of cash and now they legally own parts of our society,‚Äù he said.",Sk√•ne,/r/europe/comments/9owv03/an_icecream_truck_slaying_party_drugs_and/e7xaxnl/,Ratatosk123,1539766048

4758,"&gt;It is.

What are you talking about? The books were published in 1971-1972. So how exactly is it the first time that we're hearing about it?

&gt;This happened in Milos, Fotiadis is not referring to these events,

I already said that this happened in Milos

&gt;That's what happened in Milos. Anyway we should wait until someone uploads the sources of Fotiadis.

And according to the article Fotiadis is referring to these events too. That's from the article

&gt;According to Fotiadis, the residents of Milos tried to stop the French from loading the Aphrodite of Milos onto the French ship.In the skirmish that ensued, the French soldiers shot at the angry islanders and killed several of them. The French finally managed to put the statue on board and leave for Piraeus, with hundreds of Milos residents following on small boats.

And what do you even mean by that?

&gt;Also the above memoirs does not describe the preceding pursuit  
&gt;  
&gt;Also this event itself is contested a point which you left out from your source material. It is a story of how the left arm of the statue was damaged

Edit: You edited 1 minute before my reply. I'll read your comment again

&gt; Also according to the story the quarrel wasn't about ""Greeks protecting their heritage"" it was a dispute with a local priest who tried to acquire the statue to win favour with a dragoman or pasha. 

Where exactly is your source for that? Because I read about the armenian priest and I didn't see anywhere being mentioned what you said. 

&gt; I didn't dismiss it I asked if you had his work on this, 

Seriously? ""LOL""? ""Sad people like Fotiadis continue to make a bad name for Balkan historians with explicit nationalism ""?

And a somebody who closely studied evolution, this seems to be a baffling finding.
Throughout the history of live, progress was always achieved through the dying out of less advanced or fit species while more fit species would spread.

* Pretty much a lot of my favourite gay porn stars/peformers are Slavs. I'll say them Slavs sure do produce some the best gay porn in the world. A world powerhouse in that field tbhüëçüòéüòç. I mean porn(both gay &amp; straight) has defo put the Slavic world on the map in the modern world. Seeing as the Slav world plays a major role on the small screen(by that i mean screens of the worlds phones/laptops/PC Desktops etc)... As many of the Slavic world's most iconic cities have had a starring role in many porno movies/many major n hugely popular porn studios as well(again particulery gay porn, especially what with the likes of Bel Ami Online. Who are the biggest and most popular studio in the entire world iirc). Budapest/Prague/Bratislava/Ljubljana etc etc are some of if not Europe's and indeed (what with the internet) one of the world's main (gay)porn capitals and powerhouses. Europe's (gay)porn heartlands etc and the Slavic world is a big part of that nowadays. The Slav porn industry has again as said(much like Hollywood with its big screen movies recently) put Slavs on the map in a big way. Slavic Europe is not just about Soviet era history anymore folksüòèüòé. PS. To any Slavs reading how do you feel about the close association many of your countries have with porn in the 21st century??..


* I know must Slavs are uncut. Lotsa 4skin


* Slavic countries are very hemogenous, diversity isnt a thing like you see in the UK/France/Holland/Scandinavia etc


* I dont know if there's any truth to this, but ive read that many Slav countries are like Japan in the sense that one could be born and live there all their life, yet if your not white and or of Slavic heritage you'll never be considered one of them/of that respective's Slav country's nationality etc.. is this true??


* Are Georgians/Armenians/Azerbjianis considered Slavic??


* Largest language group in Europe



* We have loooooads of Poles here in the UK. I remember during my secondary school years there was a fair few Polish pupils at my school. They were nice and fun to hang out with tbh. I have nothing bad to say about them. We got on great. 


* Attila and his Huns were the early proto-Slavs


* Looking in from the outside Far Right politics and views seem to be very prominent and much more normalised in many of these Slavic countries. With all the regressive &amp; backwards ideas/mindsets that come with that. Which is most unfortunate. 


* Again looking in from the outside many Slavic countries seem to be deeply scared of and have a huge fear of 'the other', they seem to be very wary of outsiders that arent like them etc.. fuelling things like the sadly ever so common place racism and xenophobia that can be seen in Slav societes/cultures. 


* I learned good amount about Slavic mythology from The Witcher game series

* Hitler saw Slavs as lower lifeforms, kinda human but not really &amp; wanted to eradicate them. His whole crazy, nutjob 'Aryan race theory' nonsense was based around these nonsensical, arbitrary distinctions. Yet we see neo-nazis and facism generally gaining prominance in Slavic Europe, i dont get it tbh. Considering the history one would think no Slav would be a nazi, but human beings love to hate 'the other'. 


* I know its a meme at this point, but.. potatoes. 


* Slavic women have a reputation of being gorgeous yet personality wise of being ice cold etc.. Is this just a stereotype or is there any truth to this??..


* Slavs seem to, tend to be very hard working people


* You may live in different nations but to any Slavs reading... What are some of the unifying qualities that all Slavs share?(outside of things like language), Cultrally &amp; societally too what are some of the things you have in common with each other??.. What do you think of when you think of a Slav person??..


* To any Slav reading... How would describe Slavic food?, And is it good or not and why??..

What makes one an official member of the Orthodox Church- a tattoo? 

The Russian Orthodox Church has undermined its own moral authority by aligning its interests with those of the State and after its rather sordid history during communism. If it is indeed the biggest Orthodox Church in the world (and I really don't care that much) it is so because it is using the power of the State to further its interests rather than spreading the Word of God, doing God's work by caring for the poor and the needy and living a humble, simple life of service.

4972,"&gt;In a report to the foreign ministry in Zagreb on February 8, 1942, Nikola Ru≈°inoviƒá mentioned a visit to Monsignor Pietro Sigismondi, the head of the Croatian Department in the Vatican: ‚ÄúDuring our discussion we talked about the conversions in Croatia. He said the Holy See was glad about them but the American and British press were condemning us because the conversions were taking place under great pressure from the authorities, which the Holy See did not believe, of course. It would appear advisable to proceed somewhat more slowly to save the Holy See reproaches, accusations and dilemmas. He mentioned that even the Italian press was publishing articles about the mass conversions of Orthodox to Catholicism from time to time.‚Äù148 But the Osservatore Romano guaranteed that the conversion of the Serbs was happening ‚Äúwithout the slightest pressure from civil or religious authorities.‚Äù149 Compare this claim from the papal journal with the memorandum the leaders of the Catholic Slovenes sent to the Catholic bishop Ujƒçiƒá of Belgrade on March 1, 1942, via whom it was to be passed on to the Vatican: ‚ÄúIn the Independent State of Croatia all Orthodox bishops and priests have been either killed, imprisoned or sent to concentration camps; their churches and monasteries have been destroyed or confiscated. It is the avowed main goal of the politicians in Zagreb to eradicate the Serb population in Croatia. The conversions to Catholicism there have nothing to do with religious conviction and are humiliating processes for the Catholic Church, whose standing and dignity they compromise extremely. Any impartial observer must admit that the conversions of Serbian Orthodox to Catholicism have taken place under terrible political pressure. For there is no doubt that the Orthodox of Croatia who have converted out of inner conviction can be counted on one hand.‚ÄùThe Slovenian Catholics conclude: ‚ÄúWe are convinced that the Vatican will, on learning of this report, protest against the tragic fate awaiting the Serbs and save the standing of Yugoslavian Catholicism. Familiar with the situation in our fatherland, we consider it necessary that: the Holy See publicly condemns the bloody persecution of the Serbs and their Church; the Holy See bans all conversions to Catholicism under the existing reign of terror; persons wanting to convert to Catholicism despite the general ban require a special permit from the Holy See, which will check each case individually; the Holy See orders the Croatian bishops to protect the Serbian Orthodox Christians and their priests.‚Äù150 So this is what the Holy See should have done according to the conviction of Catholics. **And what did it do? It appointed the primate of the Croatian Church military vicar of the Usta≈°a.** It expressed its ‚Äúgratification‚Äùat the approach of the Croatian bishops on March 27, 1942, and conveyed its apostolic blessing in recognition of its great service.151 It also blessed the greatest gangster of all the satellite states at the beginning of his bloody career, during it, and on his deathbed. And it appointed this man‚Äôs closest ally, Archbishop Stepinac, who was still expecting the West to ‚Äúuse its atomic power‚Äùafter the war ‚Äúto bring Western civilization to Moscow and Belgrade before it is too late,‚Äù152 cardinal. And Stepinac had already long been sentenced to sixteen years of forced labor by the Supreme People‚Äôs Court in Zagreb. But even now Pius XII still supported him before the whole world. And rightly so! Because the bishop, whom the pope was now praising as ‚Äúan example of apostolic zeal and Christian strength of mind,‚Äù153 had only tolerated what the pope had also tolerated. And so the latter wrote on January 12, 1953: ‚ÄúAlthough he is absent, We embrace him with fatherly love‚Äîand We wish passionately for everyone to know that Our decision to decorate him with the honor of the Roman Purple is for no other reason than to **repay him for his great achievements in an appropriate manner.**‚Äù154 Archbishop Stepinac performed his ‚Äúgreat achievements‚Äùas the primate of a state in which, of two million Orthodox Serbs, 240,000 were forcibly converted to Catholicism and 750,000155 murdered, often after the cruelest of torture. Stepinac, who had neither killed anyone nor burned down a single church himself, benevolently kept this quiet for four years. As did the pope. And is Stepinac not guiltier than that Usta≈°a who wore two chains of human tongues and eyes around his neck? If one considers the attitude of Eugenio Pacelli to the politics of Mussolini, Franco, Hitler, and Paveliƒá, it hardly seems an exaggeration to say: **Pius XII is probably more incriminated than any other pope has been for centuries. He is so obviously involved in the most hideous atrocities of the Fascist era, and therefore of history itself, both directly and indirectly, that it would not be surprising, given the tactics of the Roman Church, if he were to be canonized.**

Ireland needs to accept North Ireland is a different country and that means there is a border and to work to minimize the effect rather than risk the worst outcome hoping to pull NI away from GB and then threatening GB with bloodshed over it. The lack of border was an anomaly, not the standard.

The issue comes down to the fact there isn't really an Irish-UK border in the first place. It's an EU-UK border. Ireland has no control over their own border anyway and any deal with the UK would be void because they have no authority.

5042,"Not all of them were, anyway. The Romans didn't tend to care very much about that sort of thing - what mattered to them was the social rank of your ancestors. If you were descended from a Consul or at least a member of the Senate, you're basically upper class anyway. 

If you gain prestige (or sometimes just access to the right people) through the military or civil administration, you might be rising to join one of the senatorial or equestrian families.

Adoption to the ruling families was fairly common (many emperors became related to the previous emperor through adoption), and that was good enough to count you as a member of the class of your new family. Sometimes you'd marry into the family, and sometimes you'd just be someone's newly adopted (sometimes adult) son. The social rank of girls was derived from that of their father and/or husband.

The Romans would deal with the tribal affiliations of surrendered enemies by spreading them out (including their families) to the various Legions that were spread around the empire. If you were a Gaul who had just surrendered to the Romans and agreed to serve their military, you and your family might be sent to Greece, while your neighbour went to Tunisia and your brother went to Turkey, for instance. Of course, this traffic went both ways if troops were moved permanently - after your military service, you might be given land to farm for the rest of your life, and that would be your family's land for the foreseeable future. 

That means you'd sometimes have families from Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Serbia, Switzerland, Britain, and Italy sometimes living side by side (maybe in Spain, or Germany, or where ever you or your ancestor had been deployed and eventually granted land to farm). If they all had been granted citizenship - as a reward for military service, perhaps, or through special legislation, or adoption or marriage, and so on - they were Roman, and that was that. You could be born in Rome and still not be Roman, though - citizenship was not automatic for everyone, but if your parents were citizens, that was enough. 

Of course, you'd still be stuck in the lower class unless you managed to come to some sort of political power somehow, which was mostly handed out based on heritage from a prestigious family. (If you were sufficiently wealthy at the time of a Census, that's also enough to get you Senatorial rank, but you're unlikely to be that rich if you're not already a citizen.)

But anyway, Rome was a diverse empire, and people would move from all parts of it to more or less all parts of it through the centuries. I'm sure non-white (as we might understand it) people were always a minority there, but it's not as if you'd never bump into them - and Roman citizens, at that - if you traveled through the Empire or worked within its military or bureaucracy.

(Also, the barbarians who invaded Rome successfully were obviously not fuckwits. An idiot would not have been able to defend a Roman garrison, typically, let alone establish a permanent breach in the frontier or a settlement that the Romans would grant to the invaders as part of a peace settlement, which is what winning ""barbarians"" would often get.)",Finland,/r/europe/comments/9onx0i/the_future_monarchs_of_europe/e7wn14m/,bo-tvt,1539737740

5058,"&gt;Revelations that a New Zealand lawmaker had been a member of the Communist Party in China and taught English to spies there have raised alarms about Beijing‚Äôs influence in New Zealand ‚Äî and how well the political parties there vet their candidates.

&gt;Jian Yang, a lawmaker with the center-right National Party, did not declare his past Communist Party affiliation or his work teaching spies in China on his New Zealand citizenship application. He was returned to Parliament for a third term in the country‚Äôs Sept. 23 elections.

&gt;Mr. Yang admitted that in the 1980s and early ‚Äô90s, before emigrating to Australia and then moving to New Zealand to teach at a university, he studied and taught at two Chinese educational institutions run by the People‚Äôs Liberation Army, China‚Äôs armed forces.

&gt;He said he had not named the Chinese military institutions on his application for New Zealand citizenship, and had instead listed ‚Äúpartner institutions‚Äù as his employers, because that was what the Chinese ‚Äúsystem‚Äù had told him to do.

&gt;Several China experts said in interviews that it was not possible for people to willingly ‚Äúleave‚Äù China‚Äôs Communist Party, as Mr. Yang said he did, unless they had been expelled from it. Mr. Yang has not denounced the party.
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/world/asia/new-zealand-china-spy.html

It's just a matter of following the money - Jian Yang is a major fund-raiser for the National Party. Also in the last couple of days there is a major stink erupting with a National Party MP (now sacked) accusing Simon Bridges, the leader of the National Party, of receiving secret donations from businessman Zhang Yikun.

&gt;  
&gt;Your arguments do get naiver and naiver every round.

Dunno... Maybe you could actually prove your claims instead of merely relying on your ""diplomas"".

It doesn't matter ""who"" you are but what you say. And I have yet to see a proof of your claims.

 

&gt;Education on the matter is an objective authority though. It strikes very clearly that most people here have a simplistic understanding of international relations.

Arguments from authority never prove anything regardless of the legitimity of the authority itself. If you don't even know this quit your shitty law school (that's supposed you're in a law school or haven't been kicked out yet) and read the wikipedia article.

And I am the naive... lol

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Lol, start with Freedom House for starters, let's see what good you will come up in response to that.

BAsic argumentative rule : you have to articulate your argument in a comprehensive manner instead of sending your reader on a wild goose chase.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There was a major civil war going on = popular enough.

Nice circular agument : 

* it's a civil war because there is popular support
* there is popular support because it's a civil war

Are you trying to use every fallacy known to mankind?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You mean to say that you didn't mean to hint that they are pretenses and baseless legal arguments therefore? Does that mean that they were good enough legal arguments?

FINALLY, HE UNDERSTANDS!!!! Something can be legal but immoral. Thank the gods I got that through his thick skull. I feel it's an achievement, really.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I fight fire with fire. If you make a ridiculous unfounded argument, then of course I will waste no further energy in dismissing it. You are supposed to prove your positive claim, not your negative claim... 

Except when I said ""absolutely not"" it was part of a paragraph where I explained my point. You deliberately chose to single that sentece out to feel like you achieved something. To be honnest it's kinda pathetic not only that yyou did that in  the first place, but also that you foolishly try to justify it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I deserve it because you don't feel comfortable when you fail to find the arguments against me or what? 

It's a matter of personal opinion. I feel you deserve it because you claim to study law but it tool you more than a dozen back and forth comments to understand the basic principle that the law and moral principles are two different things. If you want to keep wasting time trying to argue if you deserve my scorn or not, go ahead. I have time to waste.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  But in this case we are not talking about the legality to sue, but the legality to break that plate...  
&gt;  
&gt;Your analogy is faulty as I just demonstrated, but in the case of those legal justifications, they are still highly relevant and not ""just pretenses"".

It's not an analogy. And you fail to understand the point.

There is a difference between the action and the motive behind it.

Keep trying to dodge the question as much as you want. I know you're incomfortable with discussing the motive behind the US international decisions. ;)

5154,"You missed my point so completely and entirely that I‚Äôm actually impressed. There is nothing that forced Russia to be adversarial to the west after the fall of communism. Russia is among the most resource rich countries on earth and with a large, educated population and some incredible cities. Had Russia liberalized and embraced the west like the former Warsaw Pact did, Russia would be so much more powerful than they are today and in a way that would benefit everybody. Instead they‚Äôre *obsessed* with playing Imperialist again and have only isolated themselves with their actions in Ukraine. Nobody has forced Russia to do this, it‚Äôs not the west‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs Russia‚Äôs and largely Putin‚Äôs. All of the ‚Äúencroaching NATO‚Äù rhetoric is worthless because it never had to be a threat. Call it submission all you want, it doesn‚Äôt matter because Russia would be far better off if Putin wasn‚Äôt so intent on rebuilding Russia as a military power as he has been. Now, the Russian people are worse off but hey –ö—Ä–∏–º –Ω–∞—à!

&gt;	Putin also brought Russia back to its feet, and at that point NATO had already expanded to Eastern Europe.

This is the problem. NATO expansion wouldn‚Äôt be a threat if Russia didn‚Äôt treat it like one. It‚Äôs not like anybody‚Äôs invading Russia anytime soon, and Eastern Europe joined NATO **of their own volition**. The fact that states joining an organization to protect them from Russian military interference is taken as a threat is exactly why they joined! If the inability to invade your neighbors harms your interests, that only exposes the inherent aggression in your interests. Putin picked Russia up off the ground but he‚Äôs kept it on its knees with his foreign policy aspirations. 

&gt;	Why do Europeans want more divide and tension inside Europe in order to appease the US?

Are you actually insane? A strong, stable Europe is in the absolute best interests of the United States and has been since the end of World War II. Then and now, Russia has been the primary obstacle to this. It‚Äôs not appeasement, it‚Äôs mutually beneficial. That‚Äôs what the EU is. The difference between the US and Russia is that the US wants to get rich, not expand it‚Äôs territory. Stable Europe = more trade = we both get rich. The psychopaths in Moscow want to destabilize Europe so that Moscow will have more political leverage over its former satellites. A Europe without the EU is a Europe that has to counter this as individual states, which is a whole lot harder than as a unified block. The fact that you would accuse the US of trying to divide and cause tension in Europe only goes to show that you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. I will concede that Trump is not exactly a proponent of a united Europe, because he‚Äôs a realist moron like Putin. 

&gt;	And what do you think would happen if Putin turned against the oligarchs?

Ignoring the fact that Putin *is* one of the oligarchs, Putin has gone against plenty of oligarchs when they don‚Äôt support his agenda. He controls the country, he has dirt on basically all of them. He doesn‚Äôt go against them because he benefits from them at the expense of the Russian people. Pretty strange that you‚Äôre actually defending Putin‚Äôs involvement in this.

Russia doesn‚Äôt have to be the asshole of Europe. If their focus was on making Russia more prosperous instead of making Russia more powerful they could have stronger economic power anyway as we see in Germany and maybe a first world economy. But instead they actively choose to be the asshole of Europe, they‚Äôve completely validated NATO‚Äôs existence in the 21st century, and their economy is basically a shell of what it could be.

5290,"&gt; The Rector of AlmaMer, which no longer exists, will not bear any penalty due to the documents left in the building.  The court discontinued the criminal proceedings in his case because the regulations on personal data protection have changed.

&gt; We were informed about the latest court ruling in the case of AlmaMer, which operated in Wola, by the press section of the District Court in Warsaw.

&gt; ""There is no provision"".

&gt; On 20 September, the District Court for Warsaw-Wola discontinued the proceedings because it decided that the breach of the obligation to ""secure data"", which the rector is currently accused of, is no longer a crime.

&gt; Where did this decision come from?

&gt; It turns out that at the moment of filing a bill of indictment against the rector, i.e. on 31 January this year, the provision contained in Article 52 of the Personal Data Protection Act was in force.  He said that the offence was committed by the person who, while administering the data, ""violated even unintentionally the obligation to protect them against being taken away by an unauthorized person, damaged or destroyed"" had to take into account the penalty of a fine, restriction of liberty or imprisonment for up to one year.

&gt; However, this law is no longer in force.  New regulations have been in force since 25 May.  And by virtue of them, what the accused rector Janusz M. did ceased to be a crime.

&gt; Invalid decision

&gt; ""Decriminalisation has taken place.  Since 25 May, there has been no provision laying down any offence which contains conduct such as that allegedly committed by the accused in the present case'.  - tvnwarszawa.pl, the press section of the court.

&gt; In such cases, the provisions of the newer act, if they are beneficial for the accused, have retroactive effect, i.e. they cover what happened before the regulations came into force.

&gt; This means that the changes in the law, which imposed greater rigour in the protection of personal data on companies and institutions, paradoxically in this case worked in favour of the rector of a failed university.

&gt; The most recent court decision is not legally binding.

&gt; The district court examined the case again, as the previous sentence was opposed by the Rector's defender.  As we have already written, on 18 April this year the accused Janusz M. was found guilty of committing an act.  At that time, the court imposed a fine of 4 thousand zlotys.

&gt; Million debt

&gt; Janusz M. was accused by the prosecutor's office that in the period from January to August 2017 in the seat of the university, as the administrator of personal data, he violated the obligation to ""secure the data, in particular against unauthorized persons, taking them away by such persons, as well as damage and destruction.

&gt; In 2016, AlmaMer was closed down.  Court proceedings were initiated against it as a result of debt amounting to several million zlotys.  The university also had problems with organizing documents - indexes or diploma theses.  It was still possible to enter the building without any problems.

&gt; In December last year, we wrote that the building supervision bricked up the entrances to the former AlmaMer university, which was unsecured.  He wanted to charge the authorities of the collapsed school with the cost of the works.

The rest goes directly to the British treasury and is used by the government. So tourism or not, the British state has a significant net surplus coming in from the Queen.

And the tourism thing is in fact very true. France and Italy are Mediterranean countries with beautiful weather and beaches. England is not. And having a real royal family definitely adds something to the tourist offering of London.

&gt;, the primary responsibility for investigating allegations of sexual abuse and disciplining perpetrators rested with the individual dioceses. In 2001, Ratzinger convinced John Paul II to put the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in charge of all investigations and policies surrounding sexual abuse in order to combat such abuse more efficiently.[152][153] According to John L. Allen, Jr., Ratzinger in the following years ""acquired a familiarity with the contours of the problem that virtually no other figure in the Catholic Church can claim"" and ""driven by that encounter with what he would later refer to as 'filth' in the Church, Ratzinger seems to have undergone something of a 'conversion experience' throughout 2003‚Äì04. From that point forward, he and his staff seemed driven by a convert's zeal to clean up the mess.

Honestly it doesn't make sense, he was on a hunt to clean the Catholic Church why would he stop it once he was Pope? He wasn't terminally ill.

There are. If the Syrian intellectual elite comes to Switzerland, both country's mean intelligence goes down.

Edit: SInce this is being downvoted, here is my reasoning from a while back.

We know from TIMMS that academic achievment in Syria on standardized assessments is far bellow that of an industrial western country1. So even if only the top 30% of syria came here, their educational performance is expected to lack behind austrian performance, but that is not even that realistic in the first place, since the migration does not seem to have been particuarly selective.

Here the calculation for why we would expect the top 30 percent of the Syrias to still be outperformed by the Austrian mean: Assume Syrian ability follows a normal distribution with a mean around 1.2 standard deviations bellow the Austrian mean1. The top 30% of this normal distribution follow a truncated normal distribution with a cutoff of 0.52 standard deviation above the Syrian mean. Means of truncated normal distributions can be easily calculated with formulas from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_normal_distribution

We find a mean less than 1.2 standard deviations above the Syrian mean if we do this. Even if the syrian migration was very selective, they would not break even with Austrians, and I doubt that it is even close to.

1 Syrian Average is about 1.2 standard deviation bellow the OECD countries: https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2011/downloads/T11_IR_M_Chapter1.pdf

You are incorrectly recalling a semi-myth and suggesting that's the norm. 

Operating on a larger than usual (15-20%) overhead [doesn't necessarily spells corruption](https://trust.guidestar.org/blog/2015/11/25/debunking-the-15-overhead-for-good/). Harvard University has a [68% overhead for on-campus research](https://calnonprofits.org/programs/overhead/about-the-nonprofit-overhead-project/how-much), and yet they are almost peerless at it. Often times small NGOs have huge overheads, because their program expenses are small compared to staff salaries - who bring these projects to life. And yet, those count toward the figure, since they are all ""management"", for the NGO isn't large enough to make special hires. 

""Many"" NGOs are certainly corrupt, but many, many more than the previous ""many"" aren't.

Those are not inherent elements to Buddhism, see it like that. Buddhism is a philosophy, not an organized religion and as such it doesn't heavily interfere in local pagan cults, being compatible with them.

Therefore people keep professing their cults and incorporate Buddhism as their philosophical system.

And we see those deities and customs change depending on the region and the cults that existed there previously to the incorporation of the Buddhism.

That is also reinforced by a lack of persistent deity aside from the saints/buddhas.

5738,"I used to work for a small American regional airline that had a [crash that made national news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colgan_Air_Flight_3407). Ultimately, pilot fatigue was a major contributing factor to the crash. How it usually works is that a pilot operates out of a certain city, but the flight they are assigned to may originate from another city, and it's their full responsibility to be at that city on time to operate the flight. They're not left completely in the dust here. All airlines have a system of standby travel for employees and ex-employees for both leisure and work travel where empty seats on a flight can be taken by crew to travel to where they need to go. Obviously, on-duty crew get priority.

But what if a pilot works from Philadelphia, but is assigned to fly Pittsburgh-New York? At 5:55AM? Are there any flights to Pittsburgh that get there before then? Or maybe the flight is at 10:05AM but the only available flight to Pittsburgh is at 7:00AM (which they'll likely need to get up pretty early for, and they may have gotten home at 10pm the evening before) and it's completely full of passengers! In both cases, the pilot may decide to fly out the evening before and pay for a hotel himself.... or sleep on the airport floor. Or even worse, some airports close the gate area during the night, so you have to go sleep near the airport entrance.

Or they may decide to take a gamble and hope some of the passengers don't get on the 7:00 AM flight, leading to what was likely the cause of [United's forced removal of a passenger incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Express_Flight_3411_incident) (this was also on a regional airline that did flights for United).",üá∫üá¶,/r/europe/comments/9ol8xr/ryanair_leave_crew_to_sleep_on_airport_floor/e7v1ppy/,PickleChomp,1539686519

5976,"I know what you mean, but it's actually the opposite connection. Baltic pagans didn't need a name for their religion maybe except for the last years when crusades started, they had no need for it. So paradoxes took a name modern neo-pagans use and applied it to the historical... well, ""faith"".

Well, actually even thinking about any paganism as something separate is ahistorical and wrong, politheism is simultaneously many religions (as they origin from multiple cults of personal gods of settlements) and one religion (as when you already believe that there are many gods you don't need a much struggle to admit there are even more gods in paganism that is not ""yours"").

Austrian branch of what? Order of the Golden Fleece or of the house of Habsburg?
