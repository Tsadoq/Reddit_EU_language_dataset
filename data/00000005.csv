Macroeconomics is not like household accounting. And even there debt is irrelevant, it's what you do with the money that counts. Borrowing 10k to buy a Rolex? Probably not a good idea. Taking a mortgage to buy a house? Much more likely to be a boon for your household's finances. The debate over what's productive investment is just more complex than ""debt is bad"" and making it your single purpose as a nation to get to 0 debt asap.

""How are we going to care for all these people?? We weren't prepared for this, we just wanted to help people in need and be the good guys but not to this many people!""

""Why are they forming ghettos? Don't they know Sweden don't have ghettos? Why are the shootings going up? Why are the gang violence increasing?""

""Why are they almost all male? Where are the women and children we saw on tv that we were going to help?""

""Why are we having culture clashes?? Aren't they also humans and therefore are just like us? Surely culture, religion and ethnicity have no real meaning when we all are humans... rigth?""

And the biggest shock of them all: ""What do you mean, ""the majority want to come here because they want to live life as we do""? Don't they want to go to the poorest countries in Europe and spread evenly out to help integration? What? They want to go to the wealthiest nations with the biggest welfare looking for a better life for themselves and their children??! We can't afford that!!!😱""

And now we are juggling the problem with large migration: poor integration, rise in violence, large costs until employment (takes 16 years in average according to the Swedes institute for Statistics) no-go zones and a very, VERY underdeveloped system to handle honour killings or violence while also trying to do prevent a rise in right-wing sentimentality.

We can't even argu for the continuation of several of the countries in the Middle East and Africa as they are artificial creations that forces several different cultures/ethnicities into the same house and told to get along.

These countries are inherently distable and allways in a state of unrest or under the Iron boots of a dictatorship. 
Better to split them up and reform them along cultural, ethical and language lines, so to create natural nations.
But the ruling class in every nations despises this as it would mean lesser resources for them and figths it on every term...

Yes, the EU should be proactive, and the best way is to strongly encourage democratic and economic reform in Ukraine, not to flood the area with weapons

Prior to that the consensus was that restrictions laid out in the constitution only applied to the federal government.

Saying Whataboutism is a copout, to deflect from having been the one that set a precedent without attempting to defend your actions... and instead focus the attention on the perceived enemy.

Why are you under the impression that saying ""whataboutism"", equals a get out of jail free card, or an instant win in a discussion? ... It doesn't.

357,"China blamed European demands to meet jailed Uyghur scholar Ilham Tohti for preventing diplomatic visits to Xinjiang, suggesting little chance of a breakthrough in a stalemate at the center of tensions between the two sides.


Xu Guixiang, a spokesman for the Xinjiang government, told reporters Friday there hasn’t been “any new substantive progress” on negotiations to allow European diplomats to visit the region. Xu blamed the dispute on “unreasonable requests” from Brussels, such as demands to meet jailed Uyghurs including Tohti, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2014 on allegations of separatism.


“They want to talk to Ilham and other criminals -- this is disrespect for China’s sovereignty,” Xu told briefing in Beijing on a range of Xinjiang issues. “With such a mindset and such prerequisites, China does not support visits on that basis.”


The diplomatic tours would help European leaders show they’re taking seriously allegations of human rights abuses against the Muslim minority in Xinjiang, a leading global supplier of cotton, solar panels and other goods. Brussels is under pressure from lawmakers, domestic constituencies and the Biden administration to take a stronger line against policies the U.S. says amount to “genocide.”


In May, Europe suspended ratification of an investment pact with China, after the two sides exchanged tit-for-tat sanctions over Xinjiang. The European Parliament subsequently passed a resolution urging a boycott of the Winter Olympics next year in Beijing due to the issue.

China has dismissed allegations of human rights abuses as a U.S.-led campaign to impede the country’s rise. The country denies forcing ethnic Muslims into internment camps, work programs and birth-control initiatives, saying it policies in the region are intended to fight extremism and reduce poverty.
Before his imprisonment, Tohti was an economist at Minzu University of China and an outspoken critic of relations between Uyghurs and the Han majority. He was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the European Parliament in 2019 and his exiled daughter, Jewher Ilham, met former President Donald Trump at the White House last year.
While China regularly urges diplomats, the media and other foreign observers to visit Xinjiang, official visits are tightly controlled and unofficial ones are often met with police interference. Xu, the Xinjiang government spokesman, said Friday that those who would visit with “biased minds” wouldn’t be welcomed.
Still, Xu said China was “attaching a lot of attention” to the effort to host senior European diplomats and would provide as much convenience and access as possible. “We hope that people from across the international community will have the chance to go to Xinjiang,” he said.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ouyt39/china_stands_firm_against_eu_bid_to_meet_jailed/h75p9dx/,jivatman,1627697565

568,"&gt;The argument is about whether or not all human life is valuable

Yes... and you say it is not, based on your subjective interpretation of the crime they committed. At least mine is objective in that sense: it applies to all, equally. I can't make that kind of a decision, and neither can you. You can not judge what their worth is. You don't know the answer to that, all you can say is ""but i feel..."".

All humans are humans. Humans life has intrinsic value. No one can decide whose life would have more value, there is no objective way to calculate it. The criminal most likely disagrees with you, vehemently. What we do agree on, is that human life has value and no one should kill anyone.

Now.. do we treat all life like that? Nope.. Only human life. This inevitably leads to the conclusion that if you are allowed to kill another human, that can only happen if it is not a human. At least, not fully, it just looks like a human, acts like a human, has the DNA of a human but other factors have diminished it below human status. And this allows us to kill it.

All humans are humans. You do not kill a human.

650,"&gt;Why do you think China is organizing an almost complete information blackout—much stricter than in the rest of China—if there's nothing to see

I'm not saying there's nothing to see though. China is authoritarian and touchy about the region.

&gt;But even if they're trying to hide it, there's some direct information (aerial pictures of the camps, where you can check size, number of vehicles, etc., and get a good estimate of the scale of what's going on), indirect information released by Chinese administration (economic or administrative reports, e.g. data on migration/demography), 

The existence of the camps is no secret and neither is the Chinese economic or population control policy.

Some internet experts take these questionably interpreted documents like some big revelation.

&gt;and a wealth of concordant testimonies, many of them by people we don't have any reasons to doubt the reliability of

That depends on who is ""we"".

US and friends have no reason to doubt this because these people are saying what they want to hear. Everybody knows that, including the asylum seekers.

&gt;Honestly I don't know what you need. You're saying, ""we don't know for sure"" but you're not trying very hard. Not knowing is always more comfortable

692,"Your pedantry is noted, but it does nothing to help make your point anything other than the lost cause it is.  If the warm water from the gulf gets disrupted by Greenland's fresh water melt (which several models say is possible), then life as you know it in the British Isles will change drastically.

Nowhere near as many people would be able to live there.  Most crops wouldn't have a long enough growing season.  And it would be unpleasantly cold for more than half the year.  There would be refugees, and the countries located there would pretty much collapse into failed states.  

I'm not rooting for this outcome, but it is a legitimate threat from climate change. 

And that's just if waters go to normal.  If things get re-routed so that there's cold current rather than neutral, then you get a couple more months each year where it freezes at night.  For that latitude, here's a comparison with cold water:

One might get divisions that better correspond with what feels like the city, but certain outliers might happen just like with this ""Upplands Väsby and Sollentuna"" urban area just because its edge is slightly too far from the edge of the Stockholm urban area to be counted as part of it.

&gt; The average German doesn't profit from the EU money wise in any way. The politicians and corporations do. A lot of small businesses went bankrupt when cheap labor from the east took over working in construction for way too low prices. How did this increase their wealth?

By allowing other businesses to be able to construct houses, offices and factories cheaper than before? Thus the same amount of investment would yield better results?

No because the exoneration already presumes technology which didn't exist, so it means it's some ancient data that's no longer relevant and so on. Again, activists websites will only mislead you. 

Same for deterrence. It's agenda driven speculation, nothing more. Why do you think people flip and become informants  if deterrence doesn't work? 

I personally don't care about the cost of justice, living in a civilization is priceless, having the state monopoly on violence and enforcing that is crucial. The recent trend of 'upolicing' and anti-policing is complete insanity. 

&gt; My personal opinion is that it's extremely disturbing for governments to have the power to sentence people to death and carry out those sentences.

It's the justice system, not the government.  A separate branch. Conflating this is what marxists do to undermine our civilization. Lots of manipulations like that.

Exonerations measure the number of people who were convicted, sentenced, and subsequently released.

And killed opponents. Or just out of greed (see King Leopold from Belgium).

Oh, and I never wrote they deserved death. Not these girls, not others. They deserve the removal of all titles, wealth and apanages / personal rents, a good education and exactly the same rights as you or me. Not more rights, not less rights. But they don't need specially remembered, they have not achieved anything. They were just born in the right family, nothing else.

Here in Germany the clan of the Hohenzollern is now actively trying to get back the wealth they once had in the times 9f the last emporer. The wealth was confiscated by the government, as it was stolen in the first hand. They however don't have any program to reimburse the people they took advantage off (e.g. the Herero's in the case of german ""noble""s due to their colonialization attempt).

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_reparations#Payments

We lost a huge chunk of territory, mostly to Poland, but also Denmark, France and others. Which parts of Italy should we chop off as compensation for this aid?

&gt;At the beginning of the occupation, the Allies dismantled the remnants of German industries. Plants and machinery were dismantled, the railroad system deconstructed and everything transported to the Allies. The German merchant fleet and all other ships were handed over. Foreign stocks of about 2.5 billion dollars were confiscated. The remaining German industries had to give up a share of their production to the Allies. Large shipments of steel, coal, but also other industrial production were seized and transported out of the country.[4] Later the Western Allies softened their stance in favour of the Marshall Plan, while Eastern Germany continued to deliver industrial goods and raw materials to the Soviet Union until 1953

Harsh, but I'm down, I guess.

&gt;The Allies confiscated large amounts of German patents, copyrights and trademarks worth about 10 billion (1948) dollars.[4]

This would be about 110 billion in todays dollars. Seems fair.

&gt;Millions of Germans were pressed into forced labour for several years to work for the Allies in camps, mining, harvesting or industry.

Again. Harsh.

&gt;After World War II ended, the main four Allied powers – Great Britain, The United States, France, and the Soviet Union – jointly occupied Germany, with the Allied occupation officially ending in the 1950s. During this time, Germany was held accountable for the Allied occupation’s expenses, amounting to over several billion dollars

Comparatively small, yay.

&gt;Germany concluded a variety of treaties with Western and Eastern countries as well as the Jewish Claims Conference and the World Jewish Congress to compensate the victims of the Holocaust. Until 2005 about 63 billion euros have been paid to individuals. Additional payments by German companies which exploited forced workers have been made

This wouldn't apply.

1039,"The euro was political as much as it was economical, it requires further integration on a fiscal level. Just like the original steel and coal union was as much an attempt to create peace through interdependence as it was an economical tool.

There are economic benefits as well (although you can question whether they exceed the costs at this point). The idea is that the dollar has the ""exorbitant privilege"" of being the world currency, it being overvalued means the US can fund its liabilities for a lot less than it earns on it's investments. It's on essence a giant hedge fund while the rest of the world provides it with goods it would otherwise have to make itself. The ""exorbitant burden"" there is of course that while it benefits the country as a whole, the people who made what they now import are left without a job. 


Long, unredacted, story:

Germany/China trade surplus is paid for in dollars. These countries are dependant on exports through some (bad, imo) policy choices and instead of rebalancing they use this trade surplus to.. buy dollars. Essentially they both produce the goods necessary and finance the purchase of these goods so they can prop up employment and industrial capacity without having to develop a large internal consumer base (for which wages would need to be a lot higher). The flip side of this is that the US can live beyond its means in all sorts of manners. It can fund an outsized military and be what amounts to this globe's hedge fund. It funds startups/projects with dollars that you can do anything with. Buy oil, pay a salary in Zimbabwe, Thailand, anywhere? They all accept dollars and all the US have to do is print them while the rest of the world needs to produce something that the US needs to get a hold of them.

The Euro was very close to rivalling this dynamic but then shot itself in the foot, or rather blew of its leg, in the Euro crisis by making the international community doubt whether it really is as solid as the Dollar. A bit like you finally convince someone Aldi is just as good as Tesco's (idk what supermarkets you got) right when Aldi has a big IT problem, failed supplier negotiations make some brands pull their items from the shelves and unions strike so its not open anymore on Saturdays.

EU doesn't have the political will to use the strength of the Euro to fund growth/projects and there's doubts about whether the Eurozone will really never break. There's a strong political sentiment that borrowing money is a sign of weakness. While in fact it is just a matter of financing, it just depends what you use it for. In theory the Eurozone now has the heft to rival the US if it would employ the liquidity of the Euro. In reality we have a mentality that we are bound to the same constraints as Cambodia, Venezuela or Cuba. Let me tell you, the Euro went UP when it was announced the EU would borrow heavily with a joint debt instrument, that doesn't happen when Venezuela goes to the financial markets. 

It's like a renter being proud of the number shown in his 0.5% bank account and thinking his neighbor is foolish for taking a mortgage and investing some savings in the stock market. Whenever there's proof it's counterproductive you get the argument ""soon his borrowing will come to bite him"" as a sort of moral argument. 

Mind you this isn't a direct relationship, it wouldn't be the commission setting up a VC or something. Think more about something like general stimulus pumping money into the system which is then recycled as company profits, wages or taxes which could then be used to fund goods/new ventures/education etc.

There's the added complexity of Germany/Netherlands industrial and business sector benefitting from the status quo as the underperformance of the South makes their exports cheaper ""for free"".

Defamation, by the way means: 
&gt; Any intentional false communication, either written or spoken, that harms a person's reputation; decreases the respect, regard, or confidence in which a person is held; or induces disparaging, hostile, or disagreeable opinions or feelings against a person.

Comparing someone to Hitler definitely harms that person's reputation, so it makes sense Macron would sue the guy. Especially since your reputation is quite an important part of your succes as a president. Now it's up to the judge to decide whether or not it was an intentional false communication.

1286,"Your logic falls down, I'll explain why. Frist of all honestly, I do not use drugs/medicine, (except psychedelics). I do take antibiotics if Im ill, but that situation occurs very rarely luckily. 

Let me point that most medicine used today have gone many years of trials and testing. If they get deemed as positive and safe for the purpose they are used, they are then often continuned to use of the people. For example ivermectin or other bacterial antibiotics. We know, because trials, that they do harm to your body as side effect for example  killing bacteria in stomach and guts, but also kills the foreign bacteria which is making you sick. Most medicine do have side effects, but they are known and thats my point. Anyway it should be choice always, if person wants to proceed with the medication.

What about the idea your thought? It ends without an argument or explanation... 

With this covid vaccine expirementation, you honestly have no fucking clue in what condition your body is in 3 years. I do hope it is well but there are already worrying studies showing blood clots happening especially for fat people (or overweight, if you are thin skinned) due to body producing too much the spike protein which vaccine codes your body to do. And its not unspecified amount time, its usually 2-3 years of constant testing and trials with common combinations to see most side effects.

Did you think before in your life, like example in 2019, that different flu viruses (which include different corona viruses) are so bad that there should be goverment shutdowns and mass vaccination with experimental drug? I doubt that...

The flu has been killed by covid it is just the superior virus essentially.

Getting the vaccine gives you 90+ % immunity so there is a small chance you can still get it. Those are just the facts. You can see that anywhere the vaccine has been adminstered in large quantity numbers are trending downwards and over 90% of the people still being infected are people without the vaccine. While getting covid gives you temporary immunity, you would have to keep getting covid to get immunity again. You know just like the flu shot.

I think a vaccine is much preferable and much easier to administer to everyone then to try and get everyone infected and risk people dying or getting long haul covid.

Get out of here with your misinformation.

KFC.

KFC is red.

Do you know what else is red?

That is right.

The color red.

Red has three letters.

KFC also has three letters.

Three times three is nine.

Seven ate nine.

Therefore we are left with seven who ate nine.

There are seven days in a week.

Week.

Week rhymes with the word beak.

Beak.

Chickens have beaks.

Chicken.

Chickens have two wings.

Humans have zero wings.

Two plus zero is two.

The colonel has two eyes.

Chickens also have two eyes.

Two plus two is four.

There are four letters in the first four letters of McDonald's.

McDonald's sells chicken.

KFC also sells chicken.

There are nine letters in the word McDonald's

Nine.

Nine rhymes with the word Electromagnetic Delay Line.

Magnet.

Magnets are metal.

Cages are also metal.

Chickens are kept in cages.

Is this where KFC gets their chicken?

Let's find out!

Chickens have two legs and humans also have two legs.

So, two plus two is four.

The colonel has four limbs.

A chicken has two limbs unless you count their wings, which is four.

Four divided by one is one.

The Illuminati has one eye.

1682,"&gt; Vaccination is futile is it is not a collective effort, and you have duties that come along your rights.

 I don't recognise any such collective duty. People should be free to decide for themselves whether they want to take the vaccines or not. The health pass is an unwarranted infringement on civil liberties. If the vaccines are so safe and effective, you should not be fearful of other people's choices. 

&gt;You have no right to jeopardize the health of those who can’t get vaccinated or who wouldn’t be affected by the vaccine, the economy, and the functioning of hospitals.

The right to decline medical treatment is protected under a multitude of ethics codes. If someone is vaccinated they are protected and don't stop being so if they are around someone who is unvaccinated. Nevermind that people who have recovered from covid have excellent natural immunity. Besides restrictions are a political decision, the ones to blame for them are the ones who support them, end of.    

&gt;The unvaccinated also increases the contagiousness of the virus,

No they don't. Viruses mutate naturally all the time and it is beneficial for them to mutate in a more contagious but less deadly way. Which is a good thing. 

&gt;making it more likely new variants that could render vaccination futile will spawn.

If anything having a highly vaccinated population creates selection pressure where resistant variants are more likely to appear. Besides there have been many variants and the vaccines are still effective on all of them.

&gt;Something isn’t dangerous because you don’t know the difference between rights and duties.

No because I understand concepts like proportionality, justification, relative risk, informed consent and what it means to live in a liberal democracy.

AKIT (Literally sexism, racism, hypocrisy, and bunch of other stuff x Islamism mixed into one bag of a.. you know, trust me their wikipedia page is amazing.)

Sozcu (Highly pro-opposition, can be trusted but again not neutral so except anything.)

Cumhuriyet (Has been pro-opposition for years and years, can be trusted, again not neutral.)

BBC Turkey (Both TV and news (online), again mostly for the opposition, and hated by those pro-government, but more trustable than most listed here.)

CNN Turkey (Oh boy, opposite of the one in America, really opposite and it is ironic. On TV, wants to look neutral but literally praises and congratulates government, did advertisements for Canal Istanbul lol. News (online), well I have not checked my self but I think they were more neutral there. Plus I think they had critics (of erdogan) in the crew, not sure. Extremely mixed on this- not on their TV channel though.

Aaand, honorable mention for irony.

However, I believe that thinking that it is not true that employers just choose the best candidates. For exemple, according to a 2013 study in Sweden, people with the *same* CV, but with Swedish vs foreign name, were called back for an interview at very different rates. The CV with a Swedish name are 50% more likely to be called back for an interview vs Arabic sounding name. *That* is the basic reality with which legislator have to deal. Now, I believe it is (1) unfair and (2) unproductive. I also believe that most people, like yourself, since you said you want the best candidate for a job to get hired, think it is not a good situation and that it needs to be dealt with. Quotas are one attempt - a misguided one I think - to solve the problem. It is a complex issue that needs complex - and long term - solutions.

Also I said ""kind of"" reparations, it's at best a start of course, and there is more to be done. Furthermore in 2019 Germany pairs 23bn+ in direct state aid vs. Britain's 19bn (though per capita UK paid slightly more).

And if you want to start on historic debts between European nations we could be here all night. Not even sure how you'd do a tally of all that throughout the centuries. 

Additionally, the only thing the UK forgave in 1952 was part of the money owed from the treaty of Versailles - morally dubious debt in the first place depending on point of view. The US was far more generous since they forgave actually loans made to Germany pre-war which alone were as high as all the money owed to the other western allies together. 

Oh and yes we still paid back 50% of that, given that the UK would have gotten noting if the debt was pressed and Germany would not have recovered, overall not a bad deal in the end.

I trust the FDA because they have withheld approval of the Covid vaccines.  They recognize that the gamble is worth it, but they aren't rubber stamping the drugs.

&gt;Which is a problem. Being an engineer should never automatically entitle you to a job in engineering.

&gt;You don't address that by ossifying the job market and protecting professions, you address that by re-training and adapting the economy, workforce and job market to the new context.

This is the only thing where I disagree.

Or not really disagree because it really depends on which view you have of the market.

If you have a liberal view, then yes you are right.

But if you think about the human capital theory for example, then its not correct. People invest in their education in order to have a higher position.

None liberal wealthfare states often protect workers which have a higher qualification. This is also the case here in Luxembourg for example.


&gt;You continue to ignore the key point here: only 8% of PT time workers in Germany are ""involuntary part-time"". 92% of them work PT by choice, not because they can't find FT work.

&gt;So all of your arguments apply only to those 8% of PT workers. Which represent only 2% of all German workers.

This is true but you have to keep in mind that there also a lot of mothers which want to work FT but cant because german family politics sucks.

In countries like Finland, Sweden, Denmark or Luxembourg mothers work full time more often because their wealthfare state allows it.

And then germany has also a big problem with their care politics for old people.
Eventough they had some major reforms, more than 70% of the people are still treated by their family. Family mostly means daughters and daughters in law. 

So also those women cant work FT anymore.

If you take a look at the statistics then you can see that there was only a slightly decrease in FT jobs for men but a much bigger increase in PT for women since 2005.

2259,"If you take any number with 2 digits and apply a simply formula it will always end up giving you a 9.

Lets take the number 58 then do the following:

1. Add the digits together. 5+8 = 13

2. Subtract that new number from the original number. 58 - 13 = 45

3. Repeat until you have a number with only one digit. 4+5 = 9, 45 - 9 = 36, 3+6 = 9, 36 - 9 = 27... at this point you might notice that the digits of the number always equals nine, and something that is true is that all numbers where the digits equal nine are also divisible by nine.

So when it comes to letters and this guys rule of being able to turn nines upside down to get 6, then you could turn any letter after ""i"" to a 6.

F (6) J (10) O (15) R (18) T (20)

F = 6
J = 10 -&gt; 10 - (1+0) = 9 -&gt; 6
O = 15 -&gt; 15 - (1+5) = 9 -&gt; 6
R = 18  -&gt; 18 - (1+8) = 9 -&gt; 6
T = 20 -&gt; 20 - (2+0) = 18 -&gt; 18 - (1+8) = 9 -&gt;  6

Cool huh? :D

I'll add the explanation of why this works down here if you want to read it:

A number XY (X and Y are digits) is just made up of 10 X's and 1 Y. You can rewrite XY to X+X+X+X+X+X+X+X+X+X+Y.

By removing one X + Y we take away one of each digit. Which means we will only have 9 X's left. And since the new number will just be 9*X we can always divide the number by 9 so its digits will always add up to 9. Which in return means whenever we continue the formula we will always remove 9 from a number that is divisible by 9... eventually resulting in just the number 9.

58 = 5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5 + 8

58 - (5+8) = 5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5-5 + (8-8) = 5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5 = 45 = 9*5",,/r/europe/comments/ottah3/an_antivaxxer_from_yesterdays_unofficial_national/h6y1zdd/,PeopleCallMeSimon,1627559479

2304,"Kissinger: ""Some of my colleagues want to cut off assistance to Turkey' - -that would be a disaster. There is no American reason why the Turks should not have one-third of Cyprus.""

Let me tell you simplistically what is happening.

You don't protect Turkey over Greece, as Greece doesn't threaten Turkey. You just aid Turkey, as you have in the past, to undermine Greek and Cypriot sovereignty. You ruin Greece, you ruin Turkey, take control of their governments, but Cyprus remains independent. So you divide it to take control of it as well. You backed a dictatorship in Greece, and then backed the coup it created in Cyprus, and then backed the Turkish invasion. You helped turn Greece and Turkey against each other, profit from the weapons you sell to them, and in the end always side with Turkey when it comes to it because, as Kissinger again said, it's more important than Greece to leverage against Russia. That's why Greece left NATO, after it did nothing as a NATO member committed ethnic cleansing against a Greek population.

The only thing that could make you turn against Turkey is if it buys weapons from someone else and you stop making money from it. You almost did that when it bought the Russian S-400, but you backed off and are now giving Turkey control of Afghanistan.

2308,"&gt;They become a problem when, like in the US, your health insurance and other social needs are tied to your employment, meaning that you're unlikely to get PTO, health insurance, parental leave, etc. as a PT employee.

&gt;That isn't the case in Germany, here in Switzerland, and even in OP's Netherlands

It depends. After the Hartz reforms the working market has been highly deregulated in germany and social benefits have been cut down dramatically to a point where people in SGBII sometimes need to get their food from the *Tafel* (food bank?), which wasnt the case before.

The idea was to cut down the benefits to a point where **every** job is better than no job, doesnt matter what qualification you have.

Which, again, wasnt the case before. Before the reforms they took care that an engineer for example wont have to work in a supermarket for example.

Furthermore employees arent as protected anymore as before, especially those with temporary contracts.

And lets not forget about the *leiharbeit* (contract work?) Which is sometimes pretty close to modern slave trade.

Another problem is that a lot of people in part time jobs dont have social insurances, which is why those jobs are popular among employees. This is another huge problem.

You are right, in general part time jobs are not bad and necessary, but the german market has some specific problem.

I by myself would prefer to work 20hours a week, but those people who are forced to take a shitty part time job with no social insurance, well this sucks.

The same rules, quality tests and inspections can be done in an other place to guarantee the quality. Why would the knowledge to do so be reserved to a region? Imagine people couldn't learn nor apply some knowledge unless they go the region where it was created first, it doesn't make sense.

2633,"Austria is historically a key connection between the Adriatic and the Baltic sea. The development of the railway in the Austro-Hungarian empire lead to the main connections we have today.

For excample the Südbahn was finished in 1857 (!!) and started at Vienna (300 meters above sea level) - then got upwards the Semmering mountain range (950 meters at the highest point) - then down to Graz, trough Slovenia and then to Trieste at the Adriatic sea (today Italy)

Back then this was such an important connection, and it still is today - that also is why Austria builds the Semmering-Tunnel, a 27 km long tunnel connecting Styria and Vienna, shortening the travel time by a lot and making this route attractive for transporting goods by rail from all of the countries you see on the map to the Adriatic sea.

There also are neat ideas like the ""Rollende Landstraße"" or rolling country road - there truck drivers who usually have to travel across Europe can drive their truck on a train cart, along with other trucks - and then sleep in a passenger cart at the front part of the train while his vehicle covers the distance.

2663,"The Lord of the Rings, fantasy novel by J.R.R. Tolkien initially published in three parts as The Fellowship of the Ring (1954), The Two Towers (1955), and The Return of the King (1955). 

The novel, set in the Third Age of Middle-earth, formed a sequel to Tolkien’s The Hobbit (1937) and was succeeded by his posthumous The Silmarillion (1977). The Lord of the Rings is the saga of a group of sometimes reluctant heroes who set forth to save their world from consummate evil. Its many worlds and creatures were drawn from Tolkien’s extensive knowledge of philology and folklore.  
  
The Lord of the Rings, together with The Hobbit, is considered by many to be the start of the genre known as high fantasy, and these works have had an enormous influence on that genre as a whole.

Contrary to statements often made by critics, The Lord of the Rings was not written specifically for children, nor is it a trilogy, though it is often published in three parts: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. It was divided originally because of its bulk and to reduce the risk to its publisher should it fail to sell. In fact it proved immensely popular. 

On its publication in paperback in the United States in 1965, it attained cult status on college campuses. Although some critics disparage it, several polls since 1996 have named The Lord of the Rings the best book of the 20th century, and its success made it possible for other authors to thrive by writing fantasy fiction. It had sold more than 50 million copies in some 30 languages by the turn of the 21st century.

Well if that's the case then Brad Pitt is black. That's how I personally view him, and my opinion is valid according to your logic... and I'm the mentally challenged one lmao.

&gt;Racism against black people isnt happening, okay, thanks for outing yourself as racist already.

Lmao if you're going to lie and put words in my mouth, at least put some effort in. Oh by the way, you support genociding Asian babies... that's the level of intelligence and honesty this statement deserves.

&gt;Just because nobody else does it, which is btw. also wrong, doesnt mean its wrong, a single person can say 2+2=4 and the rest of the world can say its 5, the single person is still right.

Except in this case you're the one who's screaming 2+2=5 while everybody else is telling you that you're wrong.

&gt;You purposefully misrepresent what i showed before, shows that you either to dumb to understand them or just racist yourself, probably both.

This is one massive cope if I've ever seen one. Just because you got pressed and couldn't sustain a defense does not mean that I automatically become racist. You not knowing what racism means is your problem, not mine.

&gt;Its really funny how you desperately try to push your idiotic narrative by just using ad homs now because you know you dont actualy have an argument.

Lol what a massive projection. I think you actually lack the self-awareness to realize how much hypocrisy there is in this one reply of yours.

&gt;And again you make statements you cant know! Nobody anywhere would call them black? You checked every single Internet string possible? Nice try and a dumb lie.

This is an argument you can't win. This isn't even a subjective area of debate. Ethnic Pakistanis and Arabs are not black, that's it. I know for a fact that you cannot provide literally anything to prove your point here. The more you defend this comically stupid claim, the more you push yourself into a corner.

&gt;Great, i love that you admit that it wasnt cherrypicking by saying yourself that in the comment section the culture and religion was targeted. You learning, good job buddy. Not sure tho why you still dont understand that targeting culture and religion can also mean racism is involved, but you\`re making progress.

Lol you're the gift that keeps on giving. Okay, since you don't understand what cherrypicking is, [here's the definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking), read it. What you did is cherrypicking, but your attempt failed because the comment section ended up not supporting you. You trying to frame your contradiction as mine is not going to work out as well as you're hoping.

&gt;Again with the dumbass lies. I said targeting the culture and religion can be done by racists. Dont misquote me and try to spread your lies. Pathetic.

That's not what racism is. Racism is when people discriminate on the basis of race. Criticizing a culture or a religion is not racism. Saying they're targets of racists is meaningless because racists can literally target anything, not only that but they can still criticize a culture or a religion and not have those comments be racist.

&gt;Awesome. So the people in the pictures look black to me, so they are black. Great that you admitted to this point finally too, you really make progress.

Lmfao, you're still going with this? I don't understand how you think you can possibly win this. Calling South Asians black is quite the take, I'm waiting for when you call Sub-Saharan African white.

&gt;Cant help you if you dont get my points, they are pretty simple to understand actually. :/

Oh no, I understood your points, they were just stupid.

2771,"As someone who grew up in Yugoslavia and later lived in Serbia, I have put a lot of thought regarding this. For sure, Serbia was not ready for any kind of war since Serbia united major Balkan countries to fight the Ottomans in so called Balkan Wars prior to WW1. Austria-Hungarian empire was old and well respected but put in the shadow by colonial powers and as such loosing prestige.



Having in mind that Russia was pushing Serbia to not give up and started recruitment even before Serbia gave a reply on a mentioned notice, with the fact that at the beginning, war was more present elsewhere and not between Austro-Hungarian empire and Serbia, I suspect that this was a plot by other great powers to dismantle Austro-Hungarian empire which existed for centuries. Back then, spying was very impactful and I believe that Austro-Hungarian court was full of them pushing Austria-Hungarian empire into the war. Swaying the blame on Germany seems like a proper cover up for it all. Most importantly, dismantling Austro-Hungarian empire would be so much easier if Germany didn't come along. As if Germany ruined a good plan by siding with Austro-Hungarian empire and then blaming Germany for all of it.


100 years later, Serbia and Austria are having comparable area and population (but not GDP). Hungary lost so much territory and also comparable to Serbia. Neither Austria nor Hungary have that much of an impact as Austro-Hungarian empire had - which is a big difference. Back then Serbia was mentioned in a positive context unlike today with a super tarnished reputation - also a big difference.",,/r/europe/comments/ot2d0u/on_this_day_1914_austriahungary_declared_war_on/h6wrvek/,InkOnTube,1627526124

“Louis ran with Crown Prince Constantine and Prince George of Greece during the last lap, finishing with a time of 2:58:50. Louis's victory set off wild celebrations, as described in the official report of the Games:

Here the Olympionic Victor was received with full honour; the King rose from his seat and congratulated him most warmly on his success. Some of the King's aides-de-camp, and several members of the Committee went so far as to kiss and embrace the victor, who finally was carried in triumph to the retiring room under the vaulted entrance. The scene witnessed then inside the Stadion cannot be easily described, even strangers were carried away by the general enthusiasm.[21]

Adding to the celebrations, two more Greek runners entered the stadium to finish in second and third place. Third place finisher Spyridon Belokas was later found to have covered part of the course by carriage and was disqualified; third place was awarded to the Hungarian Gyula Kellner.”",,/r/europe/comments/otii6o/as_were_into_the_olympics_heres_the_first_ever/h6wt3la/,absolutwanka,1627526754

2805,"Easy, there is no ""bond bandits"". If ECB creates a ceiling for interest rates by willing to buy Greek bonds at sufficient interest rates the market has to budge. The squeeze on the supply of bonds is what the FED, ECB, Bank of England are doing currently, in order to stabilize the interest rates on various sovereign debt.

When recession comes the money is pulled into the core of Europe, to so called safe havens(Germany, Netherlands), at the same time the borrowing needs of the Greek government increase because tax revenue falls and public spending increases(unemployment benefits). Automatic stabilizers are in effect. 

In this moment of panic, ECB has to lend Greeks enough money, to keep the interest rates manageable, so the debt-to-GDP does not snowball. Remember we have two effects running simultaneously: Falling GDP + rising deficit. 

If ECB does not do intervene, the market will dictate what the borrowing costs are for Greek government. Because of heightened risk environment and speculative nature of the market, the interest rates will be enormous. Greeks will eat them up, and they did. Investors who locked in those bonds, have outperformed the market immensely as the panic dissipated with interest rates falling on the back of structural factors such as glut of savings in the west, active central banks and just return to normalcy.",Slovenian in Canada,/r/europe/comments/otcxy2/greek_5year_yields_hit_record_low_as_euro_zone/h6w7g08/,Joko11,1627516151

2886,"By ’with relative objectivity’ I didn’t mean that facts were subjective because there is no such thing. I meant that we were taught things with objectivity, but that the opinion of the teacher was often apparent. There was, however always room for discussion and for opinions different from that of the teacher. This is why there is room for discussion today, because the basic value of an opinion is a fundamental requirement for a fair discussion.

Your third paragraph just highlights the importance of being taught critical thinking in school, it indeed is not easy and involves the analysis of other’s opinions. So how does that justify a law which aims at silencing those opinions to be analysed? How does that show that the home is a sufficient place to teach critical thinking over school when school will confront you with the opinion of so many people to take into consideration while in a home you will only hear that of your parents?

And yes, the focus on gender is the whole point of the discussion, big parts of your life used to be determined by the genitals you were born with. The whole point is that this should not matter at all. But you can’t make a society better fpr everyone if you are not allowed to talk about everybody’s rights. And if you think this is all about sex and fun it would seem a large part of the discussion was lost on you.

And finally I’m honestly not sure if I should laugh, cry or be annoyed at this whole ’holier than thou’ attitude you just suddenly took to write a lecture on genuine conversation, especially after you made comments containing stuff like ’Are you stupid’ and ’are you retarded’ while defending a decision which actively tries to prevent discussion.",,/r/europe/comments/oqmh8t/thousands_to_join_budapest_pride_march_in_protest/h6waj4x/,Lustjej,1627517668

Why are you so desperately trying to gaslight me? I stated the point of my issue multiple times, but as you apparently still havent understood it here again, in simple words: Its fucked up that whenever Black people do something wrong people come out in droves with racist comments."" People like you are one of the reasons why this needs to be repeated.

&gt;You went and found a random youtube video from years ago on another incident... how is that not cherrypicking?

The random Youtube video is literally about the incidents i am talking about, sexual abuse by black man from asia where hateful and racist comments are used against the men. How IS that cherrypicking?

&gt;What racism? Calling out the religion and the culture that have a direct to these criminal incidents is not racism. Stop defending criminals. Also, none of these criminals are black. If you're going to lie and jump on a narrative, at least get some basic facts down.

I never said calling the religion or the culture of the man is racist, did i? Stop using strawman arguments and straight up lies! Are you telling me there is a objective way to tell when someone is black? Oh please, tell me your ""fact"" about when a person is black.

&gt;So what's the point of posting the video? It's obvious to anyone looking at this thread that you made up a claim, got caught, lied about it, got caught again, and now you're trying to save face.

To show that similar incidents happen with similar derogatory language.

2928,"&gt; It would destroy what remains of Norwegian agriculture and put food security at risk.

That's not how that works. You think Portuguese agriculture can compete with French or Spanish agriculture as well? It can't, our famers are being subsidised to keep the potential of production high in case of emergencies, as with every other farmer in Europe, or as it would happen to Norwegian farmers too. While at the same time Portuguese farmers have been specialising in more local crops (protected varieties of [cherries](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereja_da_Cova_da_Beira), [pears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%AAra_Rocha), [plums](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameixa_d%27Elvas), [rice](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arroz_Carolino_das_Lez%C3%ADrias_Ribatejanas), [pigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Iberian_pig), etc) or in more money crops (almonds, avocados, olives, micro-greens, etc). Our agriculture wasn't destroyed, it changed, if anything it developed, it's less about subsistence and producing staple crops and more about specialized crops, and the influx of money led to large investments being possible like [one of the largest artificial lakes in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alqueva_Dam) and it's huge irrigation network for example.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/orsiju/eueea_potential_enlargement/h6vslid/,joaommx,1627509170

2931,"I'm proud of the Swedish approach against Russia and hope we keep getting better. The same can be said about our stance against China. 

It's funny how big countries like Germany and France act so tough but when there's money to be made, suddenly that incredibly high horse disappears into the woods. Sweden isn't so easy to threaten. Small, yes. Powerful, not really. Moral compass? Big heart? Absolutely. 

I will forever want whats best for those in Ukraine that seek something other than Russian oppression. I will always support military backing so long as it's not a form of colonialism and it doesn't cause more civilian causalities than it saves.  

If you look at Ukraine's history, it's unfortunate. There are some highs in there, some periods of stability and prosperity but there's far more history of war, extreme genocide, serfdom, etc all at the expensive of the Ukrainian people. After all of that, Ukrainians dont throw in the towel, instead they fought and are standing up against their opressors.

They have a long ways to go, most of their government is still extremely corrupt. Washington and the IMF still give extreme caution to investors when it comes to Ukraine as it's not close to stable but they also give Ukraine an olive branch. Even in the red tape filled EU, there's glimmers of hope for Ukraine. 

Ukraine doesn't need to become a ""project"" for the West like during the Cold War how countries were built up just to show off what capitalism can do. We can help Ukraine as a country with pride, history and a future. We can treat them as our equals all while going the route of ""Trust but Verify"" as Reagan would say. 

Maybe some of you that've never really met a Ukrainian muchless visited there will do both. You will find them to be hospitable, intelligent and ready for a brighter future. They need our help, they need security first because they have a little hobbit fuck trying to do everything in his power to see Ukraine suffer. We can stop that aggression, we can stop anymore of Ukraine being taken by smart, careful planning with the Ukrainian government without provoking war with Russia and/or killing anymore innocent civilians than have already been lost (which thankfully isn't a big number).",,/r/europe/comments/otbe24/ukraine_holds_military_drills_with_us_poland/h6vsmw2/,saltyswedishmeatball,1627509187

Some fled out of simple fear, some cause they were afraid they were to be locked up for war crimes and some cause they would never accept to live in Croatia. A large part of those who just fled out of fear returned and their houses have been repaired and rebuilt by Croatia and they received Croatian citizenship.

Not all abuse in this case would cause bruises, so how would you ever prove harm done? And everyone's pain tolerance is different as well, so you can't do it by defining an allowed force of a smack

So in this case, why would you even put that into law if it's impossible to judge abuse in a lot of cases?
It's a lot easier and efficient to say all child hitting is abuse (which it is), and thus eliminate the above problem...

Soft fruit is never cheap here in the UK. This company could grow crops that are less labour intensive but more important to food  security - potatoes, root veg, brassicas, oils.

Nobody is going to listen to them year after year, trying to peddle this shit in an attempt to get subsidies for crops that could *potentially* net more if they can drive labour prices down such a huge amount.

3278,"The problem is that you're comparing completely different systems of rent control. Our system is in no way or shape the same as the one tried in Berlin as example. They failed after a year because they did it poorly, our completely different system has worked for almost 5 decades tho. 


Regarding the 2nd link that says this:

&gt;It's the same in New York and San Francisco. Everywhere that has rent control, has high rents.

Is false for Sweden. Again your trying to take examples of a bad system of rent control and compare it to a completely different system of rent control. That's obviously stupid. You're essentially comparing an apple to an orange..

Like they also mention that mostly rich and well connected people get the rent controlled rentals because not all rentals are under rent control in the examples they bring up. But almost every damn rental in Sweden is under rent control so there's no such thing as only the well connected rich getting them. 

3rd link is about some shitty rent control system tried in San Francisco in the 90's. Again comparing a completely different system of rent control to ours.

The 5th and last one is essentially quoting neoliberals because they're the only critics but they've never even once come with evidence of their claim

&gt;Critics argue that strict rent controls discourage developers from building and individuals from renting out vacant properties.

Like for one it's not even strict. If its strict then labour unions and collective agreements are too strict too... That'd be saying a lot about them.

Ask yourself this. Do you live Sweden? Obviously not. Do you know the Swedish rent control system? Obviously not. Have you read any of the countless of studies ordered by Swedish authorities and some also even done by Swedish authorities? Obviously not. 

It's true that those systems failed. It's obvious, but we dont have the same system, we've managed to actually make a functioning rent control system that has worked for almost 5 decades. 

The Swedish National Board of Housing, building and planning have already noted now in 2021 that 

&gt;The counties report on housing construction that is still at high levels.  Some counties saw a certain slowdown in the pace of construction in 2019, but at the same time note that construction is still at high levels, seen over a 20-year period.  In most counties, it is stated that the municipalities' expectations of next year's housing construction will continue to rise.

&gt;As this report is being written, new forecasts for housing construction have been produced.  In a construction forecast from December 2020, the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning states that the fall in housing construction that was expected in the wake of the corona pandemic has not materialized.

&gt;Factors that limit housing construction

&gt;As in the previous year, high production costs are what most municipalities state in BME 2020 as a limiting factor for housing construction.  However, a lower proportion of the municipalities state this factor compared with the previous year.  The second most common limiting factor according to the municipalities is that it is difficult for private individuals to get loans or that the loan terms are too harsh.  Other obstacles are a lack of detailed plans for attractive land and difficulties for developers in obtaining loans for housing production.  There are some regional differences.

[Boverket](https://www.boverket.se/sv/samhallsplanering/bostadsmarknad/bostadsmarknaden/regionala-bostadsmarknadsanalyser/innehall/)

SABO (Public Housing Sweden) (Another State agency)  got Tyréns to do a study on the subject.

&gt;It is the limited competition in the construction market and the high construction costs that are the main reason why no more tenancies are built and without increased competition in the construction sector, market rents are unlikely to lead to increased housing construction.  This is stated by the consulting company Tyréns in a study commissioned by SABO and presented on Thursday.

&gt;Furthermore, Tyréns states that the players who would gain the most from the introduction of market rents are property owners in attractive markets.  The reason why SABO commissioned the study is that one of the most common arguments for market rents is that they increase housing construction.

However, the 30% figure relates to cases the Commission investigated, which include all reported crimes against sexual liberty and decency where the victim is below 15, as well as criminal non-reporting of such crimes. (part IV.1.)

  


Out of 349 cases overall (IV.3.1.), exactly 100 had a priest pointed as the perpetrator. 55 of them were sent for prosecution, 36 of which were the non-report crimes. There were also two reports where a priest not abiding by an order forbidding him to work in teaching and caring for minors, and two where upper hierarchs swept sexual abuse of their subordinates under the rug. (IV.3.3.)

  


It's important to mention that only two Catholic Church's courts responded to the Commission (one referred to another organ), and only one of these was able to send copies of files regarding trials finished before it, with the other responding that it did not have a trial in that matter.

3357,"You should look at the comments more delicately. As previously I stated, I don't defend any unethical actions.

The MAD metaphor is used to explain the inter-distrust. For example, many people in the globe want peace(I also want it) and pursue demilitarization including denuclearization. BUT IN REALITY, there is so many barriers against the peace. For OTHER EXAMPLE, I believe you will know the silent, new cold war between USA and China. In this case, they distrust each other. Such greed for ruling power of the world and DOUBT for the opponent's first attack DO NOT PERMIT them to HAVE PEACE and TRUST.

And this is why I used the MAD metaphor. Many people want to be in safe surroundings. But they don't know that their foreign neighbor is true neighborhood, even though they are not actually terrorist. The doubt soon get bigger into xenophobia. I DIDN'T DENY and DEFEND IT. But you are VERY CONCLUSIVE.

 I just told you that in both extremes of realization of self-unknowledge and xenophobia, fear is middle of them. If one person's fear lead him to xenophobia, he will be a racist. But the other case, he can know self-unknowledge of himself and get better person who can live with their foreign people.

3392,"One day is not the other. Was there during the first days of the Olympics in Tokyo still much chagrin about missed opportunities. communication errors and just missed medals, Wednesday there was an unprecedented medal rain for the Dutch team.

No fewer than 8 medals were won and that has never happened in Dutch Olympic history.

It is an improvement on the record number of medals in a single day in 1928, during the Amsterdam Games. At that time the Dutch team took 7 medals on August 11.

The surge in medals began just after 02.00 hrs Dutch time on the rowing course. There, successively, there was success for the double-double Lisa Scheenaard and Roos de Jong (bronze), the double-double Melvin Twellaar and Stef Broenink (silver), the women's four-single (silver) and the men's double-four (gold).

Then the two Dutch favorites in the women's time trial lived up to their status: Annemiek van Vleuten raced to gold, Anna van der Breggen took bronze. And shortly thereafter, Tom Dumoulin surprised with silver in the men's race.

The eighth medal (and eleventh in total for TeamNL these Games) came from the tatami: Sanne van Dijke took bronze in the under-70 kilogram class.",,/r/europe/comments/otajdb/the_netherlands_has_their_best_oneday_olympic/h6ty2qj/,ReasonAccomplished51,1627481138

3396,"No, not at all. This is being facilitated through Article 267TEU and it is a mechanism for judicial dialogue between national courts on points of law. The issue is the reference to “court or tribunal” within the relevant directive and Article 19TEU. This requires judicial independence (see A. B. and Others, Commission v Poland (Judicial Independence) or Republika). The issue currently is Poland does not have a judicial system within the democratic norms expected so this is causing widespread issues across Poland’s court system. 

The crux of the issue is the intersection between the KRS, the Minister for Justice, the President of the Republic and the ability of the executive to use the Disciplinary Chamber to impose personal liabilities on judges for almost any reason you can imagine. The current laws, specifically 2, that apply to the disclosed procedure provide for offences that are neither certain, nor clearly defined. This facilitates direct executive control over the judicial system in Poland which means it is no longer independent which is a standard requirement for all democracies. This is law, it isn’t politics. Law deals with facts and certainties while politics is subjective. This is a stance of law, not politics. The issue however is one regarding democracy and that is indeed truly a political crisis.",,/r/europe/comments/ot5jbv/irish_supreme_court_seeking_clarification_on/h6ty5ga/,Thom0,1627481173

Est-ce que c'est irrespectueux, au nom des 33% qui ont voté pour elle, de dire que Marine le Pen n'est pas présidente ? A quel putain de moment, à la suite d'un vote démocratique, tu te dis que c'est pertinent de se baser sur ceux qui ont perdu le vote ?

C'est assez dingue cet argument.

""Marine le pen est présidente"", c'est factuellement faux.

""La Polynésie Française est une ancienne colonie"", c'est factuellement vrai.

A set of laws designed to stop black people specifically from making use of the rights the constitution and other laws afford them right after the abolishment of slavery. These laws were finally abolished some hundred years later with the civil rights act. The response by white racists was to ramp up policing of black neighborhoods, creating an incarceration state and continue to discriminate and disenfranchise black people even after hundreds of years of slavery and a hundred years of Jim Crow.

This is pretty much required knowledge to have an opinion on any issue in America that's related to race in any way or form. If you don't know what Jim Crow is, you cannot understand the underlying reason for why American police is what it is.

I had similar experience as  u/de_jugglernaut when growing up. I believe I got spanked because I deserved.

One time I remember in primary school disrespecting a teacher. As the stupid kid I was I did this to impress the cool kids group of the class, if I remember correctly. My mother got called to school because of my behavior. Right after the meeting I got spanked. Never ever in my life I have disrespected a teacher after that... Did the spanking made me understand that disrespecting others is a bad thing? Maybe. Could my parents sit down and talk with me about it instead? Yes.

I am not trying to justify that me getting spanked was the right thing to do. Because I believe in what you said - There shouldn't be a reason for smacking a child. :)

3601,"I think what has people riled is you seem to be saying that it \_doesn't\_ \_matter\_ whether these facts are true; that what's important  is the unpleasant narrative behind them.

If we don't judge truth by facts, what do we judge it by? And if truth is not our measure, then what is?

There may not be a \_practical\_ final arbiter of truth but there most certainly is a \_theoretical\_ one: things that are are true, things that aren't are not. Things are the case, that is they are facts, or they are not.

In principle, a narrative arises from facts; in practice facts are often pressed into the service of a narrative. It's quite legitimate to recognise a narrative, question the veracity of the underlying facts and the process of their selection. It's also legitimate to build a different narrative based on the same or supplementary facts. A narrative without facts or based on untruths is a false narrative. It's wrong.

The argument that it's all just narrative uncoupled from facts may often pertain in practice. Humans are more taken in by stories than they are convinced by what is actually true. But the facts still \_matter\_, they are all that we have to objectively judge between competing narratives about the world. They should not be dismissed, and a philosophy that does so is at best sophistry and at worst downright dangerous, opening the door to 'alternative facts' and the legitimation of passion over persuasion.",,/r/europe/comments/osv6po/propaganda_in_hungary_using_anime_pictures/h6t1gqn/,Stralau,1627458506

3606,"Wolves are one of the most iconic keystone species. Google Wolves in Yellowstone.

The wolves were essentially wiped out at Yellowstone, this led to an overpopulation of elk, rabbits etc. These elk multiplied to such great numbers that they overgrazed most of the foliage, preventing the growth of new forest, and homogenising the landscape into predominantly grasslands. This overgrazing destroyed the habitats of dozens of smaller species that relied on these plants, such as songbirds, rodents, insects and other small mammals. When these animals decreased in number, the number of other predators reduced (foxes, bears, cougars, eagles, owls etc.) decreased because they their prey sources had reduced.

Essentially, wolves create the basis of the entire ecosystem (hence keystone), their presence alone stop the elk from just sitting in the lower valleys and grazing all the foliage, because in the low lying valleys they’re more prone to wolf attacks. This overgrazing can also lead to the removal of plants on river banks, leading to greater erosion from rivers, this affects the fish and invertebrates who rely on foliage and woody debris to survive and can’t hand fast flow too well etc.

We are fooling ourselves to think that we know the long term safety of those vaccines.
Doesn't mean we shouldn't get vaccinated ? Of course not, but last time I checked we can't predict the future.

I can't understand based on this idea how you can be downvoted for this, that's marvelous we got working vaccines in a short amount of time, really, it's fair to assume however that the previous vaccines that get passed mandatory weren't developed in 2013 to be enforced in 2014. They were indeed battle-tested for several years if not decades ( can't speak for every vaccines tho so don't quote me on this )

Again, this is not a reason to me to be against science, but a little amount of skepticism and pragmatism shouldn't be labeled as antivaxx or something.
That's perfectly normal after all, on a side note if I ask my doctor which treatment is okay for my condition, I would trust him/her if he/her tells me a reliable one with dozens of studies than spans for +20years, I won't be as swift if he/she offers me something that came just yesterday / last year.

I should say that with the Delta variant going on, and still scattering our societies, with those variables known, being pragmatic is mostly to get vaccinated afterall, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't debate about this here.",Brittany (France),/r/europe/comments/ospto5/charlie_hebdos_cover_this_week_hitler_overwhelmed/h6t28ea/,Nerwesta,1627459169

3747,"I don’t want to spend much time on this. I didn’t bother to read your overlong comment. However.

**Stop assuming that people are stupid or that they know less than you because they don’t like the things you like, or because their opinions don’t align with yours. Assume instead that everyone you meet on the internet is cleverer than you. You will find you discussions both more polite and more fruitful.**

I know perfectly well what postmodernism and critical theory are; I have a dual honours degree in mathematics and philosophy and got quite interested in Baudrillard, Foucault, Derrida and their structuralist and post-structuralist hinterland when I was younger, before ultimately rejecting it all as nonsense on stilts, the stilts being Freud and Marx. (Marx has some merit. Freud less so). But that’s not the point.

I was using the terms flippantly to caricature the phrase ‘hyperfocusing on factuality’, which is a nonsense phrase, and exactly the sort of thing you might find in a bad undergraduate essay by someone under the spell of that 1970s nonsense. I implicitly assumed that a reasonable observer who understands what the terms mean would recognise that the portmanteau ‘postmodern CRT lecture’ is a nonsense (CRT is _part_ of postmodernism, or grows out of it, the ‘postmodern’ is superfluous, CRT is irrelevant to the point at hand). It’s a supposed-to-be-funny term dismissing both the pseudo academicism of the phrase ‘hyperfocusing on actuality’ and it’s attitude toward facts, an attitude that _was_ shared by some postmodern theorists, indeed still is by some people, even if it’s mostly rejected these days and runs counter to the views of (pretty much) the entire scientific community.

What the commenter was trying to get at was how the selective use of facts can be employed to push a certain agenda, which is entirely correct. But not because ‘factuality’ (whatever that really means) is in doubt. Which was the point and substance of my comment that was worth engaging with, not the flippant phrase ‘postmodern CRT lectures’.

At night, open all windows, put fans in your open windows to blow cool air inside if you can. Turn your house into a ""battery"" of cold.
Then, stop a room or entire house heating up as much. Keep the curtains closed, and cover them in an extra layer of sheets. If your curtains are dark, put up white sheets inside them to reflect light. 
Keep doors inside closed, and stay on the side opposite the sun when at home, so the whole house doesnt heat up at once.
If you are particularly bad with heat, put aluminium or tin foil on the inside (or if possible outside) of the glass. This cooled my house by 8c, even without the foil!

If it is hot outside and you can, every hour, throw some buckets of water over the walls. As it evaporates, it will cool the house.

Take ice, and wrap it in a damp cloth or damp towel. Put the ice part on the back of your neck, the sides of it wrapped around to secure it. This can last a good while, and cool you more. Even without ice, it helps. You can refresh it with just more water from a bottle, even if the water is warm from the sun.

Also, taking ice and placing it *directly behind* a fan. If it is just water ice not a ""freezer pack"", scattering salt on the ice makes it absorb heat faster. This will make the fan air cooler! Once it gets over a certain tempreture, a fan alone will not cool.

Laying down on the grass and soil can also help if it is not too dry, as the ground can be cooler.

You can get ""pet cooling mats"" for like 15 euro, that you can lay on and will suck the heat out of your body faster than the air. Good for a few hours, before they have to rest.

So we end up with a bit of a clusterfuck as local economies are being threathened by a predator that in the past 100-200 years has never been present in certain regions.  
It is also a big threat to tourism, as winter will lead them to lower altitudes which will bring them towards skiers and hikers.  
The situation is very complicated, but i think all voices should be respected and listened to.",,/r/europe/comments/osrp0v/wolf_distribution_in_italy_since_1900_their/h6sl7y7/,xRedPepper,1627446482

3931,"&gt;That would be absurd, and NI voting against the NIP is not ""in breach of a peace agreement"". You are either lying or a moron.

And you're again not aware of the practical aspects of such a vote. Neither the EU nor US will be allowing a de jure border formed on Ireland by the UK, which is the case once NI votes against NIP. Simpler to just drag the entirety of the UK into the Single Market as it was in the 2020 transition period.

&gt;Lmao. Is that meant to be a good point. The UK was near bankrupt after WWII. LMAO. You are very ignorant.

And you're under the impression it stayed near bankrupt 15 years later. That's half a generation later. How dumb are you?

&gt;There won't be a trade deal with the US, thankfully. Nobody wants your dodgy food. You eat that. Too poor quality for us. The country is the UK. Can't even get the name correct.

Yeah, posting about UK cuisine as high quality......that's the real laugh. If you can find it, anyways. 

&gt;NordStream 2 is unrelated to Brexit. And economic is different from nationalistic concerns. America moves as it wants for the former.

&gt;Germany and Russia ignored the US, did what they wanted, and the US just gave up, fucking over the Ukraine, supposedly a US ally. Like Putin with Crimea or Obama's red lines in Syria. You love canals - you just gave away Panama lmao. How pathetic. The US is weak and gives in. 

Russia's been sanctioned for decades and is not a trade partner to the US by any means. Germany was a part of the EU and as we have seen with other trade wars, EU is large enough to resist American sanctions, whereas UK is not.

&gt;Where was loyalty to Ireland in tax negotiations? Ignored this point, didn't you.

You're under the impression that loyalty is absolute when there is a clear difference between nationalism and business. US very much prefers the idea of a peaceful Ireland. What it does with its businesses are a different story.

&gt;Lmao. You are an American nationalist. No wonder you keep mentioning the irrelevant US. I looked at your post history - you are obsessed by the UK and Suez. How intellectually uncurious you are. Stop spamming the same stupid point over and over. I asked for recent examples. Ignored that of course.

&gt;After the fall of the Soviet Union, the US stood alone. Now look at you. Huge debts, a rising China. Allies don't take you seriously. Vote in old men who are barely coherent. If the US wants some advice on being a declining superpower, ask us Brits.

China has the same issue Germany and Britain had 80 years ago. No energy security. No oil within reach of their homelands should war erupt. It's how Britain turned into a US foreign attack dog over the century, jumping into its wars. Churchill's naval switch from coal to oil and subsequent inability to secure a British source of oil cemented who the junior partner in the relationship would be.

&gt; Sorry but don't blame the government when you had 2 months if not more to book an appointment and didn't.

With that being said, I'm blaming it because the government shouldn't get a free pass either. I'm willing to take my own responsability as you can see, that doesn't mean I can't criticize how poor the response was and that's exactly where we both disagree.

I personally despise the fact that you whitewash our governement just to divide people each other, with a giant armada of tu quoque or sophism alike.
Stop being that manicheist, like I said I'm fully aware I'm not that white on that matter.

My point remains the same, today, right now as we speak I can't find an appointement, this is directly the consequence of the recent law passed lately.

I doesn't take an huge amount of years studying urbanism to understand that it's always better to have a steady flow of cars passing on a highway, given they should drive slower than to have a giant traffic-jam on your next hotspot / toll because everyone decided to drive on that particular road at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They will be well treated, maintained and educated, until they have occupation or destiny with which to live, according to their class and returned to the peoples of their nature, those who had been removed with that condition. 

Every kid got clothes, articles of personal hygiene and personal ""tableware"". 

About kids health and Isabel Zendal role, Balmis, the leader of the expedition declared:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;With the excessive work and rigor of the different climates that we have traveled, she completely lost her health, tireless night and day she has poured all the tenderness of the most sensitive Mother on the 26 little angels that she has in her care, in the same way that she did from La Coruña and on all trips and has assisted them entirely in their illnesses 

At most the documents and private letters from Balmis mentioning the kids, he seems to be specially greatful for the kids role saving millions of lives and talk about them with affection.

From the **55 kids** that participated in the expedition **all but 1 survived**. **24 were spanish**, from Madrid (6) and Galicia (18), all **orphans,**  22 of them crossed the atlantic to vaccinate american territories, while 2 Madrid kids remained at Galicia. 21 of them **remained at Mexico after vaccination, well attended**lodging and education at the expense of public treasury. However **the only child that seems to have died was one of those spanish kids during the travel across the atlantic.**

For the Philippines vaccination Balmis recruited **26 mexican kids, mostly with a family in this case. They all survived and returned to Mexico** after vaccination.

Finally Balmis recruited **3 last kids** (filipino?) that **helped to introduce the vaccine in China** and **survived**, but I ignore if they returned to Philippines or continued with Balmis to Spain.

Isabel Zendal remained in Mexico with his son, at Puebla de los Angeles.

4098,"So because religion is involved they have permission to ban it? That sounds like the opposite of freedom of expression covering freedom of religion. 

&gt;It is more legitimate than the demand to wear a hijab,

There is no legal demand in France to wear the hijab. If an Islamic woman walks around in France without a hijab there never was and hopefully never will be a legal punishment. If there is a parallel authority of some sort enforcing that THE ISSUE IS WITH THE PARALLEL AUTHORITY NOT THE HIJAB. If people from Iran are still forcing women to dress a certain way against their will no French law can change that. These women are still slaves to their communities we just now don't need to look at the fact. They aren't wearing middle eastern clothes so we can pretend they are French now. 

I'm not going to debate specific instances. The law doesn't even help the specific instances. If a man won't marry a woman without a face veil and her only path to success is marriage the solution is not banning the face veil. Not wearing the face veil doesn't change the power dynamic of the relationship or what happens outside the public eye which is where the real issues are. 

&gt;For every case of a person like her there might be 10 girls who enjoyed a life free from the demands of religious parents.

Do you really think religious parents (of any religion) end their demands with a face veil? Enforced purity, managing who they are friends with, domineering parents come in all sorts, what clothes they force their children wear is a minor aspect of them. 

&gt;well actually there are laws about what's acceptable to wear in certain public places so that wouldn't be surprising.

But there would never be a blanket ban. Because French women wear bikinis. There is nowhere that a woman can wear a hijab now because men forced some women to wear it. 

Worst of all this makes the very women we claim to want to help criminals. Now if they go to the cops for being forced to wear a hijab they get slapped with a fine and treated like a criminal. All this is is criminalizing overt displays of possible oppression so we can all pretend nothing is wrong anymore while the women are still trapped inside with no real chance at freedom.",,/r/europe/comments/osrrjx/i_felt_violated_by_the_demand_to_undress_three/h6rtda3/,demonica123,1627431940

4139,"&gt; But racists love to latch on to that weak excuse and claim the victims are actually victims of ""woke culture"" instead of the strong class discrimination that is still going on there


Some of that is true, but actually **both, the fear of being called racist, and sexism towards young girls** were big factors. The former reason was more dominant when talking with social workers and investigators, motivated by a form bigotry of low expectations, and a sense that only the ""leaders"" that belonged to that community (Pakstani) were allowed to address these issues. This is clearly documented in the Casey report (a follow-up of the Jay report) that investigated the ethnic factor in those sexual exploitation cases in Rotherham. You can read that [in page 31-36](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/401125/46966_Report_of_Inspection_of_Rotherham_WEB.pdf). 

To quote from the conclusion (page 36): 

&gt; Rotherham’s suppression of these uncomfortable issues and its fear of being branded racist has done a disservice to the Pakistani heritage community as well as the wider community. It has prevented discussion and effective action to tackle the problem. This has allowed perpetrators to remain at large, has let victims down, and perversely, has allowed the far right to try and exploit the situation.

Then those people are protected through the vaccine and aren't less so by being near people who aren't vaccinated.

No, that is stupid and unscientific. Viruses mutate all the time and if you get the virus, you become immune to it.

However, the Bektashi order does not seem to have attracted quite as many adherents from among Bosnian Muslims, who tended to favor more mainstream Sunni orders such as the Naqshbandiyya and Qadiriyya. The order represents the official ideology of Bektashism (Turkish: Bektaşilik).

I get that life in your original country is not the best and might be violent, but if you have to choose to migrate to a different country, why wouldn't you choose countries like Saudi Arabia, Oman, UAE? These countries are peaceful, geographically closer, speak the same language or a very similar language, much more similar in culture, similar or same religion, and they are absolutely rich and full of opportunities. Why spend more money and travel longer to go to Belarus and spend days walking in a swamp to get to Lithuania which is completely alien to your culture, your language, your religion, and is definitely not richer than its ME counterparts? I genuinely never found an answer to these questions.

They do. Turkey hosts 4 million Syrians, Pakistan hosts 1.4 million afghans, Saudi Arabia has approximately 2 million+ Rohingya, Palestinian, and Syrians altogether. Jordan hosts 3 million refugees.

4330,"&gt;	Funnily enough, we have about the same rate of firearm ownership as the Czechs, cca 2 %.

Then your country has a drinking problem that needs to be addressed. That is not a moral argument for handguns. What are the driving causes of alcoholism or drunk driving in your country?

The United States has a similar problem with drunk driving, unrelated to their handgun problem.


&gt;	What you are missing is that citizens have the right and the means to acquire a handgun legally

Legality is not morality. It doesn’t matter what they have right now, the moral argument is that handguns should be removed from our communities, as shown by the great success other developed European countries have had with this and the evidence that handgun ownership is the direct driver of handgun deaths.

&gt;	It was a genius guess.

It was a lie. Handgun access alone increases murder rates. Alcohol access alone does not increase murder rates.

No amount of personal responsibility can make handguns a boon for communities. Alcohol is not like this. Alcohol has many, many examples of the harms of prohibition. Handguns do not. Apples and oranges.

&gt;	and most of those who do have no malicious intent.

Irrelevant, since there is no reasonable justification for that choice and their access to a handgun directly endangers those around them by an incredible margin. Bars are deadly to very, very few people while handguns are deadly to everyone.

&gt;	Availability is to be considered here,

Availability is exactly the problem. The more available handguns are the more people are shot to death. There are no other effects.

&gt;	Those who want firearms to perform a malicious act will get them regardless of ""the human experience"". 

This is a strawman argument. Bans make things harder to get. Even bans on alcohol lower consumption, the problem is the _cost_ is too great and impractical. Handgun bans are extremely effective at lowering total numbers of handguns in countries. Handguns do nothing to enhance individual safety while countries without easy access are demonstrably safer because of it.

&gt;	the black market will thrive as it does now.

If it is thriving then the point is moot. Reducing general access to firearms will also pressure black market smugglers though. Handguns are not simple to manufacture.

&gt;	That's why the firearm black market doesn't exist, right?

It’s existence is immaterial. You just admitted it’s not impacted by civilian access to firearms. If you’re right your point is moot. If I’m right black market firearms become harder to acquire.

This terrible comparison between alcohol and handguns falls down principally because manufacturing a handgun is non trivial while homemade vodka is. Add on the fact that alcohol does not make it convenient and easy to kill someone and the comparison becomes a bad faith argument at best.

4417,"See, it's not like Germany decided to buy gas yesterday. They have been buying gas all this time, and the new project doesn't change the amount of gas Germany will be buying. Whether they use Nord Stream or not, Germany has been buying gas for decades and will be buying as for the foreseeable future. In fact, it removes the third party from the equation that can really put political pressure on either one of them (Ukraine). So, the worries about Russia using gas as a means of pressure are unfounded.  I mean, you weren't worried about it before, were you? Nord Stream 1 keeps humming along without much political noise, so will Nord Stream 2.

And here's another reason why Nord Stream 2 is in fact needed for stability in Europe (if you care so much about it). The Ukrainian gas system is falling apart. A few years ago they did a study and found 85% of it is in dire need of repairs. Ukraine hasn't been doing anything with it, no upgrades, no modifications. By 2024 the situation will be even worse. So, let's say there was no Nord Stream 2 or Turkish Stream and other bypass routes. That would mean the European gas supply is reliant on decrepit and archaic hunks of metals. Without tens of billions of dollars worth of repairs that Ukraine doesn't have, transporting gas through Ukraine becomes a ticking bomb. And of course, the EU would have to pay for repairs and modernization because Ukraine doesn't have money. 

At the same time, Nord Steam 2 and other pipelines are newer, modernized pipelines that don't carry that risk, don't have costly repairs coming, won't cause any problems down the road, and won't hold Europe hostage to pay for them.",Canada,/r/europe/comments/os41qh/anschluss_the_political_cost_of_the_usgerman_deal/h6pwi7g/,YuriTheRussianBot,1627401122

The sad truth is that (a) most people don't care; they'll keep buying, (b) people can't afford to care; alternatives cost too much relative to their income or are not readily available or (c) they care and try, but because of how many brands these mega-corporations own, you are accidentally still using some of their products.

A lot of things here.

Firstly what you are referring to is the Macedonian/successor pike block, it is sometimes still called a phalanx but is a separate innovation using the Sarissa two handed as opposed to the Dory a spear used in one hand alongside the Hoplon shield (hence Hoplite) which is the equipment of the traditional classical phalanx.

However Macedonian pike blocks still used shields they were just strapped to the arm and smaller instead of being held in the hand:

"" In 1900, Kaiser Wilhelm II had been enraged by the killing of Baron Clemens von Ketteler, the Imperial German minister plenipotentiary in Beijing, during the Boxer Rebellion. The Kaiser took it as a personal insult from a people he viewed as racially inferior, all the more because of his obsession with the ""Yellow Peril"". On 27 July 1900, the Kaiser gave the infamous Hunnenrede (Hun speech) in Bremerhaven to German soldiers being sent to Imperial China, ordering them to show the Chinese no mercy and to behave like Attila's Huns.[56] General von Trotha had served in China, and was chosen in 1904 to command the expedition to German South West Africa precisely because of his record in China.[57] In 1904, Wilhelm was furious about a revolt in his colony by a people he also viewed as inferior, and likewise took the Herero rebellion as a personal insult, just as he had viewed the assassination of Ketteler.[58] The bloodthirsty language that Wilhelm II used about the Herero in 1904 was strikingly similar to the language he used against the Chinese in 1900.[59] However, Wilhelm denied, together with Chancellor von Bülow, von Trotha's request to quickly quell the rebellion.[60]

No written order by Wilhelm II ordering or authorising genocide has survived.[58] In February 1945 an Allied bombing raid destroyed the building housing all of the documents of the Prussian Army from the Imperial period.[61] Despite this, surviving documents indicate the tactics used by Trotha were the same tactics that he had used in China, only on a vaster scale. It is also known that throughout the genocide Trotha remained in regular contact with both the General Staff and with the Kaiser.[62] Historian Jeremy-Sarkin Hughes believes that regardless of whether or not a written order was given, the Kaiser had given Trotha verbal orders.[63] The fact that Trotha was decorated by Wilhelm II and was not court-martialled after the genocide became public knowledge lends support to the thesis that he had been acting under orders.[64] General Trotha stated his proposed solution to end the resistance of the Herero people in a letter, before the Battle of Waterberg:[65]:11

I believe that the nation as such should be annihilated, or, if this was not possible by tactical measures, have to be expelled from the country ... This will be possible if the water-holes from Grootfontein to Gobabis are occupied. The constant movement of our troops will enable us to find the small groups of this nation who have moved backwards and destroy them gradually.""

That's not correct, because you don't account for those who were in the UK who have returned, and those who were not in the UK who applied before coming here.

&gt;That's a recognition of their existing status, where they ALREADY have families, jobs, homes, spouses, etc. - in some cases for 40+ years before Brexit.

Given how freedom of movement did not exist before 1992 (29 years ago), then if they were here in the UK it would have been under different arrangements.

&gt;It's not some endorsement of the UK, it's literally that these people were basically de-facto British, living in Britain exclusively already. It's a rubber stamp that they are allowed to stay in Britain.

Surely then the 5.4 million would have left and returned to their countries of origin if there were not happy with living here. Or do these people have no means to act on their own accord?

&gt;Then charge people who are obese and are not on a diet, charge people who smoke, charge people who go over the speed limit, and those who do not regularly exercise, then those who do not stay hydrated, then those that take antibiotics like it's candy, those that do not wash their hands before eating and so on

All of these factors are taken into consideration with private health insurance, life insurance, or any other kind of insurance. Why do you think someone should eat the costs of your unhealthy lifestyle? You're comparing being a jew to being fat? **Can you tell the difference between things a person cannot change and things a person can change?**

&gt;charge people who smoke

We already do. It's a tax on cigarettes and alcohol in every country with public health services.

&gt;charge people who go over the speed limit

We already do. It's called a traffic fine.

&gt;and those who do not regularly exercise, then those who do not stay hydrated, [...] those that do not wash their hands before eating

This cannot be put into law because it cannot be enforced.

&gt;then those that take antibiotics like it's candy

Antibiotics are already being given out only by prescription in any modern country.

In Singapore, a country with possibly the best public healthcare system in Asia people pay less when they're younger and more when they're older. Because when they're younger they use less of the public health services and make less money, and when they're older they use more public health services and can afford to pay more. Is this fascism to you? People who cannot afford to pay are qualified by the fact that they literally cannot afford to pay so the system takes into consideration everyone.

4786,"I'm glad you find my replies constructive! I think even if we may disagree with other, bashing them or their opinion only polarizes both of us more.  


I see! Here in Italy instead we have a large share of people 50 or older (less fragile than older people but more exposed because they are still working) that are still not vaccinated, while younger people were more open to vaccination even before the greenpass. So I think if the virus spread more we would indeed have problems.  


I agree, mutations are inevitable but I also think the rate at which the virus is mutating now can be slowed down by limiting the contagion.  
For the longer effects the vaccine may have, I feel like this is a valid fear but in my opionion the risk is still lower than the benefit: Covid itself has long-term problems and it's being speculated that even just showing mild symptoms may increase the patient's chances to develop neurological problems later on in life.  
The vaccine effects would be more maneageable if there were any in my opinion.  
I also want to point out that I don't really know if other medicine's long term effects are studied: people who got the vaccine months ago still seem to be fine so we are talking in years term, but what medicine is ever tested for years and years? There will always be drawbacks that get discovered after decades, because medicine advances and we discover things we previously didn't know.  
For example just recently I saw an article which said paracetamol (one of the only drugs pregnant women could take because deemed safe) may have effects on the neurological development of the fetus and be associated to psychiatric disorders like ADHD.   
So yeah there is no ""totally safe"" thing in life, even food can have long-term effects like the development of cancer!  


That said, everyone should absolutely be free to evaluate the risks by themselves and choose freely and I agree that communications about the vaccine should be more clear, especially to te general public via the media!  
These are only my opinions and conclusions based on the pieces of infos I know and my own perception of risk and may not apply to anyone else.",,/r/europe/comments/os0uz3/people_protesting_against_the_introduction_of_the/h6ouw7j/,Ehileen,1627380095

4801,"&gt;As people are taking the opportunity to move out of big cities, house prices have grown the most in Wales at 10.2% and the North East at 8.8%. House price growth is weakest in London at 5.6%. For flats, prices have risen the most in Scotland at 5.2% and the Midlands at 3.7%, but in London, flat prices have fallen by 0.5%. Zoopla said it was also seeing a jump in demand for properties in outer London, up 86% on 2017-19 levels. But the housing website said that it expected sales in London to improve, ""providing there are no further pandemic setbacks"", since the rental market had already bounced back. ""Further relaxation on the restrictions around global travel will result in a firmer pick-up in demand, which will also reverse the downward trend in pricing,"" Zoopla said.

&gt;Surging demand for houses will last well into 2022 as buyers continue to look for more room after being cooped up during the pandemic, says property website Zoopla. A search for space has pushed up the average price of a house by 7.3% over the past year, reaching a new high of £230,700, it says. While houses are proving popular, flats are less sought after. But properties of all kinds are in short supply, the firm stressed.

&gt;""Demand for houses is twice as high as typically seen at this time of year between 2017 and 2019, accelerating away from demand for flats, creating a disparity in average price growth across the two property types,"" Zoopla said. ""House prices are being supported in part by a severe shortage of homes for sale, with stock levels down some 25% in the first half of the year compared to 2020."" The firm said that while house prices were surging, the growth in flat prices was lagging at 1.4% over the past year.

&gt;""The rise in demand for houses is something we saw in the first lockdown,"" Grainne Gilmore, head of research at Zoopla, told the BBC. ""It's a reassessment among many homeowners of where they want to live."" Ms Gilmore said that with the rise of working from home, many people wanted a spare room that could become an office, while others were seeking garden space. ""A cohort of buyers has eroded the supply of family houses and put upward pressure on house prices more than flats over the past 12 months,"" she said. ""That's a situation that we would expect to continue into 2022."" ""We're still seeing very high levels of demand in the market, even now with more modest stamp duty savings,"" Ms Gilmore added. 

&gt;The price of the average UK house has jumped by 30% since 2007, when a typical house cost just £177,300, according to Zoopla. In June alone, house prices were up 5.4% year-on-year, although buyer demand dipped 9% in early July because of the stamp duty holiday coming to an end.

4815,"&gt; My own personal opinion is that the EU has members who would like to use their legal commitments to accept refugees to deal wirh public dislike for immigration

I don't know what you mean by that, are you saying that some EU member countries want to accept refugees to overcome the dislike of immigration? That does not sound logical.

Anyways, I doubt any EU country wants Afghan refugees. They come from a country that is poor, backwards and with abysmal education standards - the refugees coming from there will on average represent those characteristics and hence they will be difficult to integrate culturally and will be largely useless economically.

You could make a case for Syrians that there was at least some economic potentional there, since Syria was relatively developed and more modern than Afganistan prior to the civil war, but even in their case, they have been a massive burden economically speaking and are only slowly managing to fuction without state aid.

And I am not even mentioning the huge political burden it was, it caused a massive rift between the EU states in the South, West and East and to this day, the conflict is not solved, it's just hibernating until another crises comes.

The reason the EU can't abandon the refugee treaties is that it would pretty much go against the values it was build on. And you know that the EU prides itself on being a values-based community. Of course nobody wants to actually follow up on the commitments when it comes to masses of people coming from some 3rd world countries, but you can't just openly say ""yes, we should help refugees, but actually when it comes to hundreds of thousands of Afghanis, they are largely culturally backwards, a big portion of them is basically illiterate when it comes to European labour markets, so they are likely just gonna be a big pain in the ass, so we pass"".

It's stupid and hypocritical and I wish it wasn't like this, but it is what it is.

&gt; Was anything achieved? Sure, I'd say so. The specific people involved are gone. 

Could this not have been achieved by targeted short-term operations? Did we need 20 years occupation for that? Did we need to waste financial and human resources on that when the result is that ""conservative religious"" government, aka Taliban will take over, likely triggering a refugee wave? 

I understand that you can't build a nation in Afghanistan, but it took 20 years to realize that? 

Sorry, but I think with the 20 years occupation, you likely just broke down the fabrics of the society there even more, now you have a significant portion on the society who were in one way or another involved with the western forces, or got used to their presence, these people will now try to flee or fight. 

I just hope Iraq scenario will not play out there, but I wouldn't be surprised.

5194,"&gt;There is no ""naturally"" involved. Tit-for-tat trade tariffs - very scary lmao.

Especially for the UK, which is a net importer of goods, concerningly food and energy, from the EU. Escalation to outright embargoes wouldn't be too far fetched either, given UK would be in breach of a peace agreement.

&gt;The US is not involved. There are two sides. Your adjectives are puerile.

Yeah, that's what Anthony Eden said too, 60 years ago. No need to involve yourself, we have Suez under control.

&gt;Three years to diversify. Three years for the EU to start prepping for the border wall they'll need to build. The US could probably help with that.

You've had 5 to wean yourself off food and energy sourced from/through EU territory, and that's not even including US retaliation.

&gt;Yes, it ultimately failed.

You say that and yet you no longer own Suez.

&gt;It also occurred 70 years ago. 

Yeah, when Britain had an Empire and the second largest economy in the world at the time. It's what, 7th today?

&gt;They can try. The US was desperate to avoid a Brexit, happened anyway.

Desperate? ? It's a near unknown for most of the populace outside the Irish, only the politicians care much about it. And no, as stated before the US finds the NIP a great opportunity to exploit GB while respecting GFA. After all if GB's willing to grant deep market access for agriculture to *Australia* (no offense to Australia) just to maintain some semblance of EU level trade, it's not an exaggeration to see a trade deal where the much larger US rips open market access to say, finance and strips London of its assets in exchange for a pittance of its own market access.

&gt;NordStream 2 is a more relevant example. Or the current US administration utterly ignoring Ireland's interests in the global tax talks.

NordStream 2 is unrelated to Brexit. And economic is different from nationalistic concerns. America moves as it wants for the former.

A much more relevant example on how the threat of sanctions, foreign or self imposed, already does to Brexit Britain already exists.

1. Internal Market Bill's offending provisions (ones where a Minister claimed it only breaches the law in limited and specific ways) were struck once it became clear the EU and US would retaliate under such a move.

2. Signing the TCA in Christmas and giving the EU everything it wanted (free trade in goods) while getting little in return (practically no equivalence in services.) This was once trade in WTO terms became imminent if no deal was signed upon the exit of the transition period in Jan 2021.

3. Faced with the cliff edge of chilled meat grace period expiring, the UK forfeited the right to change laws regarding food for the duration of the ""Sausage War"" extension. An EU demand in order to grant said extension.

All of these aside from 1 are self inflicted trade sanctions, but Britain folded on every occasion. There's little reason to believe they'll hold strong when anything more serious comes up. Something like a lapse in NIP and subsequently GFA.

Yes, you don't have any healthcare insurance whatsoever in Greece because you're in %179 debt ratio to it's GDP. Up until 10 years ago, you couldn't even withdraw 100 euro from atm per day hahaha. What insurance?

Lots of behaviours are being frowned upon by society, just like not getting vaccinated and there's nothing wrong with that. It's just society and its values.

5287,"Yeah, I can understand that saying ""boogeyman authoritarianism hurr durr"" may seem like you're making point to you, but let me clarify what you're attempting to strawman. 

Cases are rising again and too many people are still unvaccinated. Italy isn't Finland, where pretty much no one lives and some of our regions do not have a functioning healthcare system despite being very densely populated. We know that we still haven't reached our herd immunity treshold, and if the trend isn't addressed now it will be September 2020 all over again. And we do not want another September 2020. The point of lockdowns is to prevent the healthcare system from being overloaded again in two months, which will prompt new shutdowns.

There is a solution to this. A way to avert lockdowns: vaccination. And as of now, the people who are getting hospitalized are essentially the unvaccinated.

Now, if you're the government, you won't impose new restrictions on everyone, as that would be unfair. You will instead impose restrictions on the selfish morons who have boycotted the national vaccination effort. And those restrictions are temporary, anyway.

&gt;and typically their supporters only protest against the authoritarian legislation if the other side introduced it

No, people protest when they believe something is unfair. Most people believe this is fair.

&gt;It's especially damning when one side is supposed to be liberal.

Because you think liberalism means freedom/rights without responsibility/duties. That's not liberalism. That's kindergarten.",,/r/europe/comments/os0uz3/people_protesting_against_the_introduction_of_the/h6neh8e/,BeatPerfect8674,1627344876

&gt;  
&gt;Ok so you acknowledge that the ""left"" is not one unified block, but yet just a second ago were suggesting they all share one view on Islam seemingly to disparage them.

I qualified my definition of ""the left"" so it applies in retrospect to my OP. Is it really that difficult to understand? 

&gt; It's like me saying people on the right of politics are stupid because they want to build a wall on the US-Mexico border.

Which unironically is exactly what is said, only that argument is based solely on the fact that they are ""republican voters"" and not for any real or supposed dichotomy.

&gt;In this particular case of Islam branding it as a left issue is sort of pointless. Maybe most that hold the contradiction are left, but not all people on the left hold it.

Here in the UK the Labour Party are pushing hard on courting the Muslim vote. You should perhaps do some reading on the last bi-election in Batley &amp; Spen where Labour used election material which, had it been the tories doing so, would have been widely attacked. 

That's what we have with the party that represents  the UK left - on the one hand being the champion of equality, whilst at the same time courting the muslim vote.

5601,"&gt;After the withdrawal of Western troops, Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz expects more people to make their way from Afghanistan to Europe. He announces a continuation of his consistent deportation policy.
Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz (ÖVP) warns the European Union of an increase in refugee numbers after the withdrawal of Western troops from Afghanistan. ""This is dramatic for the people there, this will lead to migration flows,"" Kurz told Bild newspaper on Sunday in a recorded edition of Polit-Talk.
He said he believed that Afghanistan's problems could not be solved by Germany and Austria taking in masses of people, as they did in 2015. He was therefore ""very glad"" that the line had changed in Europe and Germany vis-à-vis the uncontrolled immigration of 2015.
""We as the European Union must take action now, already in the summer, in order to prevent similar situations from happening again as they did back then,"" Kurz said. He announced a continuation of his consistent deportation policy, even if the Taliban in Afghanistan should take control of further parts of the country. ""We will certainly continue to deport to Afghanistan."" If people had to flee, he said, ""neighbouring countries, Turkey or safe parts of Afghanistan are definitely the right place to go, rather than people all coming to Germany, Austria or Sweden.""
If the number of refugees from Afghanistan increases, Kurz fears a new quality of violent crime. ""You only have to look at the crime statistics. Much of the brutality here did not exist in the past. The figures are very clear in certain groups as far as the accumulation of violent crime is concerned, as far as the accumulation of sexual violence against women is concerned, for example.""
More Islamism and anti-Semitism in Europe
He said his concern was also about possible immigrant Islamism. ""I don't want to import exactly this sick ideology into Europe,"" the Austrian chancellor told ""Bild"". He added that one should not lump all refugees together; many had integrated very well.
But: ""We have imported a lot of anti-Semitism to Europe in recent years, especially through these migration flows. We have many people who have come to us who are clearly homophobic and who do not necessarily uphold women's rights. ""Kurz referred to the security situation in French suburbs, in Belgium and in other EU countries and recalled a murder case in Vienna at the end of June. Several asylum seekers are suspected of having sexually abused a 13-year-old girl and causing her death.
He reiterated Austria's demand to create the possibility ""to deport via third countries if a deportation to the country of origin does not work directly"". However, there is still no agreement on this in the EU.
Brief on the Ibiza Committee of Inquiry
Report
Because of the accusation of giving false testimony before the Ibiza Committee of Inquiry, Kurz expects to be charged by the public prosecutor's office. ""It could easily be,"" Kurz said in the ""Bild"" programme about a possible indictment. However, he said, even after repeatedly reading the accusations, he ""still could not see where I had said anything wrong"".
He knew what he had done in his life and what he had not done, the Chancellor stressed. ""And I have definitely always deliberately told the truth."" Asked if he could remain chancellor as an accused man, Kurz answered, ""Yes, of course!""
The opposition had accused Kurz of lying to MPs in the Ibiza Committee. According to the Austrian news agency APA, the specific issue is whether Kurz was involved in the nomination of a confidant for the chief post of the state-owned holding company ÖBAG. Kurz had denied this; according to the opposition, however, chat messages prove the opposite.
The so-called Ibiza affair triggered a political earthquake in Austria in May 2019, leading to the break-up of the governing coalition between Kurz's ÖVP and the right-wing populist FPÖ and to early elections. The background to the affair was a secretly filmed revelation video in Ibiza showing the then FPÖ leader and later Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache promising state contracts to an alleged Russian oligarch's niece in return for campaign aid before the 2017 parliamentary elections.

5653,"&gt;So now you change your argument from ""it doesn't measure intelligence"" to ""it is not perfect"", nobody called it perfect

It doesn't measure intelligence, it measures some limited subset of what intelligence is.

&gt;nobody called it perfect.

You do when you use it as proof that intelligence has a near perfect normal distribution so that `mean` equals `median`.

&gt;There's no reason not to think that intelligence is at least approximately normal distributed,

Burden of proof is on the person making the claim, otherwise I can also say there's no reason not to think unicorns exist.

&gt;you have half of people taller than the other half, half of people have higher blood presure than the other half

Uhh, that's not evidence of a normal distribution, that's just using an actual `median` instead of the `mean`/`average`.

&gt;It's a result of [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem), basically ""when independent random variables are added,

Yeah, except you're not adding independent random variables here, you're talking about the distribution of a single variable so the CLT doesn't apply.

&gt;That means that even if individual causes for intelligence: different genes, health, nutrition, etc would not be normally distributed the result would be. 

No, you completely misunderstood CLT, you go study it again. The examples you gave aren't even independent variables (or random).

&gt;Also, even if it's not normally distributed, in any distribution there's a point where half of people are smarter than the others,

... and depending on how transmissible the disease is, to build herd immunity. It's not just about individual impacts here but very much about **public** health.

The States General of the United Provinces of the Low Countries, to all whom it may concern, do by these Presents send greeting:

As it is apparent to all that a prince is constituted by God to be ruler of a people, to defend them from oppression and violence as the shepherd his sheep; and whereas God did not create the people slaves to their prince, to obey his commands, whether right or wrong, but rather the prince for the sake of the subjects (without which he could be no prince), to govern them according to equity, to love and support them as a father his children or a shepherd his flock, and even at the hazard of life to defend and preserve them. And when he does not behave thus, but, on the contrary, oppresses them, seeking opportunities to infringe their ancient customs and privileges, exacting from them slavish compliance, then he is no longer a prince, but a tyrant, and the subjects are to consider him in no other view. And particularly when this is done deliberately, unauthorized by the states, they may not only disallow his authority, but legally proceed to the choice of another prince for their defense. ",Amsterdam,/r/europe/comments/orx1w2/440_years_ago_the_netherlands_including_flanders/h6l4w11/,DeRuyter67,1627307735

&amp;#x200B;

Switserse Standaardduits, of Switserse Hoogduits of Schweizerhochdeutsch, wat deur die Switsers Schriftdeutsch of Hochdeutsch genoem word, is die geskrewe vorm van een van die vier amptelike tale in Switserland, behalwe Frans, Italiaans en Romeins. Dit is 'n verskeidenheid standaardduits wat in die Duitssprekende deel van Switserland en Liechtenstein gebruik word. Dit word hoofsaaklik geskryf en eerder minder gereeld gepraat.  
Switserse Standaardduits is nie 'n Duitse dialek nie, maar 'n verskeidenheid standaardduits. Dit moet nie verwar word met Switserse Duits nie, 'n sambreelterm vir die verskillende Duits-Duitse dialekte (in die sin van ""tradisionele streeksvariëteite"") wat die alledaagse tale in Duitssprekende Switserland is.

&amp;#x200B;

2. In Afrikaans, there are no verbal conjugations, and very much fewer different tenses.
3. Dutch has 2 articles, Afrikaans only has 1.
4.

https://uk.news.yahoo.com/most-covid-deaths-vaccinated-heres-102424441.html

I know of it when Prof. Dr. John Campbell went through the stats in his periodical videos in the UK. The ratio was 4:1 on hospitalizations, 2:1 on ICU and 1:1 on deaths.

I believe it's because of different age groups so the 80+ don't get proper imunity from the vaccine because they don't have a working imune system and they turn up dead at a similar rate as 50+ unvaccinated, but I have no data to back it up since it's not parsed by age.
The only thing that hints at this is hospitalizations in Israel, there they split under and over 50 hospitalizations with 1 and 2 doses, and for &lt; 50 it's what you would expect about 5:1 ratio but over 50yo there were marginally more vaccinated then unvaccinated admitted in the hospital ( I think there's the same 80+ effect at work but also 50yo who became more socially active after getting the vaccine then their unvaccinated friends who isolated).",,/r/europe/comments/oriz9u/the_failanx/h6kjckb/,murdok03,1627293268

5985,"&gt; Except it's 50% of those dying are vaccinated in the UK not 99% News but source is real

Perhaps that's what it looks like in the UK, but not in the US, and not in Denmark &amp; Iceland.

Maybe it's because the AZ vaccine is the main one that's been used in the UK?

&gt;And there are 10x more deaths associated with COVID Vaccines this year then all smallpox vaccines in the last 30 years.

Because we've granted them temporary rushed approval due to the global pandemic that has killed millions of people, despite the largest lock-downs and anti-spread initiatives in human history.

The same way you would cut off somebodies leg if it could save them, the same way we're doing this.

I'm sure that some of those vaccines won't get full approval in plenty of countries. That's why the health authorities decided not to use AZ &amp; J&amp;J in Denmark, because the amount of cases/day were very low, and the risk of side-effects from the vaccines was not deemed worth it.

In the UK, France, and plenty of other countries it was deemed worth it, because they had some of the highest rates &amp; deaths of COVID in the world.

&gt;And CFR was &gt;30% for smallpox (higher in children), and it's 0.03% (lower in children) for Covid (in total in US 300 12-18yo died from/with Covid). Up on Smallpox Wiki Covid deaths by age: 300 12-18 (when I last checked)

Yeah, but you can't directly compare it like that. Healthcare has *greatly* advanced since smallpox was an issue in developed countries, and the death rate for covid was *waaaaay* higher than 0.03% when it peaked early on in Italy &amp; the US.

It wasn't until we all implemented the strictest lockdowns in human history that we managed to, kind of, get control of it.
I'm sure that a modern hospital would be able to deal with smallpox far better than they did in 1890.

Italy had a death rate of over 2% early on in the pandemic, and NY was at 1.7% - while that's lower than smallpox, COVID is infinitely more infectious with a far greater R rate.

&gt;So it's comparable to any degree, I wouldn't even say these are vaccines, more like profilactic therapies, and I agree with the German RKI children shouldn't get vaccinated (unless they have increased risk due to comorbidities).

It's not about whether children are dying from the first 5 variants, it's about whether we will see mutations that do start killing them if we leave them unvaccinated and it spreads.",,/r/europe/comments/oriz9u/the_failanx/h6kjqvb/,upvotesthenrages,1627293629
