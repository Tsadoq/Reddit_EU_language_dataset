95,"He did not happily fight for him, he pulled Hungarian armies off of the front as much as possible. He refused Hitler's demands several times, NOT once, several times. First with Czechoslovakia. He was offered all of Slovakia with all the historical borders as long as Hungary supported the invasion. Denied. With Italy's help southern Slovakia with Hungarian majority still got transfered, and carpathian ruthenia was conquered to get a border with Poland.

1939 Hitler demands Hungary let's German troops through it borders to quicken the invasion. Denied, saying that it is a matter of Hungarian National honour to not to take any military action against Poland. 160k+ Polish refugees and soldiers flee to Hungary where they are disarmed - Jews are given Catholic papers - and they are given best conditions possible at a time like this, many leave through yugoslavia to fight in France (Polish schools were opened from elementary to university with churches as well).

Anti semitic laws were introduced to please Hitler and not get the country invaded with the amount of times they said no to him. The laws were there but not really enforced.

Deportations were limited and people were just expelled from the country and put over the border before the German invasion and I don't believe he knew about them but who knows that's arguable. Then the Germans came in to impose their will on the country since we weren't doing enough for the ""Jewish question"". He was forced to appoint a fascist pro German government giving people power that were pretty much the Hungarian Hitlers,but he stayed in power so he could do more instead of abdicate and save his honour. This fascist government is responsible for the quick deportations, they were the ones planning out everything not Horthy. During this time he continued peace talks and as mentioned before halted deportations for a while but with hundreds of thousands of German troops in the country that's kinda hard to keep up. When the peace talks finally came to term an unconditional surrender was given to the Russians, the armistice announced, aaaand then the Germans arrested the government and the war continued. The biggest shit you can give him is for the poor planning of the armistice. Not much else. He was somewhat naive and could've done more in situations, but I think he did what could.

Votes should be prorated on the likelihood that the individual voting will have to live with the results.

They're not a part of the nation The Country Where This Will Happen, just like me.

So you apply actuarial tables about life expectancy to vote weights. It's also how you fix the fact that old people are less into voting to save the environment -- it doesn't matter, they'll be dead soon.

21? Great, you get. 9999999 votes for the next us president because that's the likelihood you'll experience the impact of your vote. Me, at 43, I get .978 votes. A 60 year old gets .93, etc. 

It's not practical, but if voting rights are derived from citizenship then we really ought to figure in likelihood of no longer being a citizen in a conservative, probabilistic way.

156,"This ""letter"" sent the 7th of December, so a week ago, barely made it to the media (outside of the facho-sphere as far as I can see, your source point to a website that has neo-nazis websites on its ""friend page"" list) for a good reason : it has been sent by the same general that wrote a letter to the previous president on the exact same subject, immigration (source : [another alt-right website](https://la-dissidence.org/2014/12/30/lettre-ouverte-du-general-martinez-a-francois-hollande/)) and who's been very active in the alt-right sphere since his retirement, mainly by giving speech to events organized by the main allies of the French alt-right in favour of ""the defence of the Christian civilisation"" or ""a de-islamisation of France"" and saying things like ""we need to bring France back to its former glory"" or ""rule of law is rule of weakness"" which lead him to found a movement to ally all patriots against Muslims in France. 

As far as the other names are concerned : Charles Millon is from the alt-right, Dider Tauzin tried to be candidate for the presidential election of 2017 under nationalist idea and said publicly that he's a member of a group that is ready to do a coup d'Ã©tat, Christian Piquemal got fired from the army in 2016 because he organized a revolt against refugees etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So this is a real letter, it's not ""fake"", but at the very least the title is grossly misleading. It's not a mystery why your source is an alt-right website and why outside of ""Le Parisien"", no big media talked about this as far as I can see why nearly all the big alt-right French websites have reposted it : this is alt-right propaganda, done mostly by three alt-right politicians with the support of some retired soldiers.

162,"Ireland was occupied and looted by Cromwell. England sent settlers over there to help make it more British.

Britain refused when Ireland wanted devolved powers, so they had a  revolution and left the UK (1922). They were allowed to leave provided they left behind the part that had a lot of settlers in it - a border was gerrymandered to maximise the size of Northern Ireland so that it was 51% Unionist (union with UK).

Those unionists had all the best jobs in Northern Ireland and catholics (native Irish) were treated as second-class citizens. When they protested the British started internment without trial, and when they protested some more the British shot the unarmed civilian protestors ([1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_\(1972\))).

Northern Ireland is a thorn in the Brexit process because the Troubles were ended by the Good Friday Agreement, which allows everyone to be Irish or British as they please, and which promises there will never be a border between the two countries (1999).

Since then Northern Ireland has been governed with a power-sharing agreement which has broken down partially because the Unionists [changed the name of a fisheries vessel](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-38601181) (from *BanrÃ­on Uladh* to *Queen of Ulster*), [scrapped a Â£50,000 irish language scheme](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-38422550) (Â£500 each for 100 students to study the language - i.e. it's fucking cheap) and even [scraped the Irish from a dual-language manhole cover](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/irish-word-on-manhole-cover-row-deepens-as-word-scraped-off-34536272.html). I.e. they still treat the Irish with contempt. 

Leaving the Union is not as simple as you make it sound. The country is completely divided and had spent only a decade and a half healing, after all these centuries of division. Brexit threatens to put it back where it started.

244,"It's more complicated than that.

The wording of the 1975 referendum was biased towards staying:

&gt; Do you think the United Kingdom should stay in the European Community (the Common Market)? Yes/No

And there was a huge imbalance in funding. https://www.ft.com/content/ba52695c-0a96-11e5-a8e8-00144feabdc0

&gt;Spending in the 1975 referendum

&gt; Exactly 40 years ago the British public voted to remain in the European Economic Community by a margin of 2 to 1, writes Jim Pickard.
&gt; 
&gt; Every county voted Yes to stay in the bloc â with the exception of the Shetland Islands and the Western Isles.
&gt; 
&gt; Britain in Europe, the Yes group, was impressively well funded, backed by an array of big corporate names such as Debenhams and BP. In total it raised Â£1.5m â or Â£11m in todayâs money.
&gt; 
&gt; The anti-European opponents, called British Business for World Markets, had just Â£133,629, equivalent to Â£1m today. Most of that consisted of public funding.
&gt; 
&gt; Their total donations exceeded the entire amount of spending in the previous general election.
&gt; 
&gt; In the 1975 European referendum the CBI spent Â£50,000 â equivalent to Â£375,000 today â on literature, organisation and promotion. The group had polled 12,000 members, discovering that only seven thought membership was bad for business.
&gt; 
&gt; The list of donations from the referendum reads like a roll-call of big British corporate brands, many of which are still going strong.
&gt; 
&gt; Both BP and Sainsbury gave Â£25,000, P&amp;O gave Â£20,000 and Â£26,000 came from the London Stock Exchange. There were smaller gifts such as Â£500 from Ladybird Books and Â£100 from Flymo.

Because the ""issue"" is that the UK doesn't want to have a border but also doesn't want to follow the single market rules.

You can leave the EU but follow the single market rules, like Norway, and there's no border. You can leave the EU and just sign a trade-deal and then there's a border. This bit of the discussion is not a negotiation, the UK just needs to decide what it wants and it will get it. There's no spite, there is however a lot of annoyance at the attitude from the UK.

314,"&gt;But then in France we have about 15% renewables and we manage to be cleaner than the examplary renewable country.

I think a better descriptor here would be low-carbon, which France has plenty of, and which renewable is a part of. 

&gt; To balance 1% of renewable you need 1% of coal

Coal is an inefficient way to balance renewables. It doesn't cope well with lower load factors, it takes too long to start up or stop, and the strain of stopping/starting over the course of a day leads to problems with the machinery. Coal functions as baseload which can sometimes displace/be displaced by renewables, but it doesn't fill the gaps economically like gas. 

What happens with Denmark is often that the excess electricity during a windy period goes to the Nordics, who store it in hydro, which is then sold back to the Danish during low-wind peak. 

&gt;Which is worse than the hydro + nuclear France is using

France uses roughly 70% nuclear, 10% hydro, 10% fossil fuels, 10% other RES. France also imports as much as 10% of demand on cold days due to electric heating which is mostly German wind and coal ([just look at this price difference](https://twitter.com/PPchef/status/819117895468875776/photo/1)!) because it can't cope with peaks. Nuclear + hydro isn't the silver bullet, [especially as hydro is so weather dependent](https://www.icis.com/explore/resources/news/2018/02/23/10196550/icis-power-perspective-the-iberian-peninsula-droughts-hydro-at-risk-gas-fired-power-on-the-rise/) and nuclear isn't dispatchable.

Crimea was annexed in contravention of international law as laid out by global bodies such as the United Nations that Russia is party to, while Northern Ireland opted out of the creation of the Irish Free State, in *accordance* with the constitution of the Irish Free State back in the 1920s before such international law existed.

And you know, islands aren't more legitimate or somehow indivisible just because they are arbitrarily cut off from a different landmass by the sea. Once upon a time Ireland was connected by land to Great Britain, for example. It's funny because people who use that argument in favour of a united Ireland still tend to support Scotland becoming independent from the rest of the UK which would govern the rest of the island of Great Britain. Why can Great Britain be split but not Ireland?

Regardless, the island of Ireland has never existed as one united country independent from English or British rule. It doesn't have greater legitimacy than any other state or border. Before English and later British rule, the island of Ireland was home to numerous disunited tribes, always at war with one another.

Northern Ireland is the result of 800 years of English and British presence in Ireland. British-identifying Northern Irish people have lived in that part of Ireland for generations, and if they count as an implanted population then so do the rest of the 'Celtic' people living in the Republic of Ireland, the ancestors of whom only arrived less than 3000 years ago, replacing the bronze-age peoples who were already present on the island of Ireland.

The US does not use economic leverage against places like Poland because the US has no economic leverage against places like Poland. Poland and the US do little overall trade and all trade agreements the US makes which cover Poland go through the EU. The US canât put individual economic leverage over Poland anyway.


To the extent that the US just offers a better deal to Poland, like more offsets, cheaper training, a wider variety of weapons the plane can carry, thatâs not economic leverage. Thatâs just the US offering a better deal than Sweden or France can.

401,"Short answer: crisp. clean.  

Long answer (just rambling): Funny thing is, you get used to it if the shift is gradual enough. Well I guess you have that with lower positive temperatures as well: What feels like a ""horribly cold 15 degrees"" in fall, will feel like a ""nice and already quite warm 15 degrees"" in spring. That being said, minus degrees don't feel too bad as long as it's sunny and there's no wind. A rainy, windy 5 degrees can feel *much* more miserable than a sunny minus 5. Also, really cold air is always dry, so it's important to keep your skin protected. Also, your exposed skin gets all prickly once you come inside. And I personally feel that (again, as long as there's no wind) I don't feel  much of a difference below a certain threshold. Minus 5 feels not much warmer than minus 15, it's just ""cold"".

Some people feel strongly close to their Central Asian roots in the East (Gokturks, Hun Turks, etc.), some feel close to their European roots in the Western Turkey and Thrace (Balkan, Greeks, Bulgarians, Baltic people mixed with Central Asian Turks), and some feel close to their Kurdish and Armenian and Jewish backgrounds. Everyone has the freedom to feel whatever they want. Turkey is not just all 100% Turks, it's a mixture of lots of different people. That's like saying ""Everyone is of German descent in Germany"". You are sadly wrong if you possess that mentality. This is why people like you are giving a bad name to Eastern Europe.

&amp;nbsp;

Bottom line: We probably have more ties with Europe due to our history, culture, backgrounds and upbringings than anywhere else. Ottoman Empire spent more resources in Europe than anywhere else as well. Geographically, Turkey is both in Europe and Anatolian Peninsula of Asia. Turks are mixture of all kinds of cultures and backgrounds. I can't tell you to feel like an ""Ashkenazi Jew"" or assume ""you are a jew"" just because majority of them originated in Poland and other Baltic states, maybe your background ISN'T an Ashkenazi Jew. There are people from lots of different backgrounds, religions, gender, everything, sky is the limit in Turkey just like in Poland. There is a little bit of European, a bit of Asian, a bit of Central Asian, a bit of everything. Some people feel 100% European because at the end of the day, there are 100% Europeans on both sides of the bosphorus who was born and raised in Thrace, people who expatriated back from Bulgaria and the Balkans, etc, there are people who feel 100% Asian on the East of Turkey, and people who feel half European and half Central Asian because of people getting together from different backgrounds due to migrations after World War I ended. The combination of all this is what makes a Turkish Citizen, and a proper Turk. It is its own identity. It's European-Asian, or Eurasian, like Russia, your favorite country and BFF :)))",Republic of Kebab,/r/europe/comments/a5wts7/you_have_to_pet_the_cats_if_you_wanna_use_the/ebstwcx/,petcockabibliophobia,1544819657

It is flawed, because many numbers don't exits, but they **do not omitt early deaths from nuclear**. E.g. there are only estimates but no certain death toll or concrete numbers for increased cancer rates related to Chernobyl (general nuclear energy does not lead to early death, only the ~~2~~ 3 big catastrophes). I imagine it is likewise difficult to obtain true numbers for death tolls related to rare earth element mining or construction in China. I wouldn't trust the exact numbers, only the general order of magnitude.

Also this:

&gt; It's important to note that we may consider the values of death rates and hypothetical number of deaths from nuclear power quoted above to be worst-case projection of risk and mortality. The figures for death rates per TWh from Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) are calculated on a theoretical basis using a method called the 'linear, no-threshold model'.7 The basis of this model assumes that the number of deaths is directly and linearly proportional to the dosage of radiation; additionally it assumes there is no lower limit or ""safe"" level of exposure, meaning individuals are at risk even at very low doses.

&gt;However, this model for estimating mortality risk from radiation exposure is particularly controversial, with suggestions that it leads to an overestimation of probable risk.8 Furthermore, as James Hansen argues in his 2011 paper, our empirical evidence of mortality risk based on historical nuclear events (of which, there has been only three large-scale incidents: Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima) is several orders of magnitude lower than those we would predict from theoretical linear, no-threshold models of probability.9 As a result, we may consider these models (and the quoted figures used in the charts above) to be an upper, worst-case estimate of risk rather than one based on historical evidence (which may fail to accurately reflect worst-case conditions).

Belarus has always been a balancing act, because it is too strategic in placement for either side to own outright (in the middle of Russia, Ukraine, the Baltics, Kaliningrad and Poland means whoever controls it controls a great defensive/offensive position), but Putin got greedy with Crimea and Eastern Ukraine and seriously freaked Lukashenko out.

You did not have control of Kosovo when you were first recognized. That land was conquered during the first balkan war, and the london conference granted it to you despite the majority population being Albanian.

This is where most historians agree the modern conflict between Serbs and Albanians started: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Albanians_1877%E2%80%931878 In areas that would become the principality of Serbia, the actual Serbia in that time before conquering more land. And this is where you first ethnically cleansed Albanians.

Most historians agree that Albanians are descendant of one of the old balkan peoples. Either from Illyrian tribes, or Dacian/Thracian tribes. If you have another opinion you're free to share it.

No it isn't how the 4 balkan members made up divisions, you're so full of shit seriously. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_of_Albanians_in_the_Balkan_Wars
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_League

""Apart from the Russian pressure upon Bulgaria and Serbia, another issue that triggered the formation of the League was the Albanian Uprising of 1911. The timetable of the negotiations between Serbia and Bulgaria indicates that progress paralleled the success of the Albanian revolt. In May 1912 the Albanians succeeded in taking Skopje and continued towards Monastir, forcing the Ottomans to recognize the autonomy of Albania in June 1912. For Serbia this was considered catastrophic; after her hopes of expansion to the north were thwarted due to Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 1908, Serbia now found the last direction of possible expansion, the south, also closing due to the creation of an Albanian Vilayet. The Serbs now wanted to stop the establishment of the Albanian state. On the other hand, Bulgaria used this Serbian anxiety in order to force Serbia to agree to significant concessions in regard to Vardar Macedonia. Thus the final agreement between the two countries stipulated that, in the event of a victorious war against the Ottomans, Bulgaria would receive all of Macedonia south of the Kriva Palanka-Ohrid line. Serbia's expansion was to be to the north of this line, including Kosovo, and west to the Adriatic coast, a territory including the northern half of modern Albania, giving Serbia access to the sea. In essence, Serbia was forced to exchange Macedonia for Albania, an issue that would play a key role in the eventual dissolution of the League in the spring of 1913, when the Great Powers insisted upon the creation of the Albanian state and denied Serbia her territorial gains in that direction.""

Yes we did hold western macedonia, we just weren't powerful enough to keep it since balkan league were much stronger. Actually read the sources available instead of making things up as you go. Serbia and all balkan league members simply had imperial ambitions with bs historical excuses. 

What was yours back, so almost half of Albania even? Was that what you considered yours? Was it Serbian? Recent genetic testing doesn't say so? Albanians were majority in Kosovo, and you had imperial ambitions. That is what makes the developments of the recent decades so glorious, all those crimes came back to haunt you and now you're hurting because Kosovo is lost.

Significant new and concrete information is now available which was not available before. I can't think of any sensible process where you'd make a huge decision based on a whim and then be committed to follow through no matter what comes later. 

For example when one big company decides to buy another big company, they first agree to begin negotiations, then negotiate and then shareholders of both companies vote on the final deal. 
The shareholders can reject and that still in no way undermines general trust in negotiations. 

The fact of the matter is that the UK has taken the referendum very seriously and committed huge resources to negotiate a good deal in the last two years (their success is up for debate of course). So no-one needs to question the validity of referendum results in the future.

719,"I would like to offer a few counter examples and show that nuclear fuel reprocessing can be done with less radioactive spillage then current oil, coal or gas industries.

http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/wang2/

&gt;Another concern is that the plant proposes environmental challenges. Due to plant operation, certain low-level radioactive liquids are discharge into the North Sea. However, the total radioactivity of the plant operation contributes to 5% of the total dose from all industrial discharge in the North Sea, with oil and gas operations, and phosphate mining contributing to 35% and 55% respectively.

With the 5% figure falling due to new technology emerging, the plant is not a natural disaster as some may put it. Marine life as well fisherman have not been affected at all.

The leader of Greenpeace France, Yannick Rousselet, has since stated that they have ceased attempting to criticize the reprocessing plant in La Hague on technical grounds, having succeeded at performing the process without serious spills that have been frequent at other such facilities around the world(referencing mainly Russia not Europe btw). In the past, the antinuclear movement argued that COGEMA would not succeed with reprocessing.

Eric Blanc, deputy director of the processing plant, says that although the plant does intentionally release radioactive material, the annual dose in the vicinity of the facility is less than 20 microsieverts per year, which is equivalent to the dose of cosmic radiation received during a single transatlantic flight, and therefore within regulation. The AREVA NC emphasizes that they are committed to keeping the dose below 30 microsieverts per year.

https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/17-23991_PUB1746_web.pdf

This reports seems to confirm this as it says that France's regulators have not found any evidence for above 20 microsieverts per year in of the workers or surrounding population.

You can see that apart from the 70's the technology has matured and overall discharge has come to a minimum, no substantial environmental impact has been found.

Only 1 leak has ever happened and it was in 2005, all the material was contained and no damage was made. Yearly radiation is monitored for all staff and local communities and no evidence of impact has ever been found.

As more plants open up and reprocessed fuel will become more economically feasible, right now there's more than enough nuclear fuel to go around. All these old plants can be upgraded to serve breeder reactors.

Used waste can feed Breeder reactors or reprocessing methods used to minimize it's volume.

High radioactive waste is about 3% of all waste created and has most of the radioactivity(about 95%).

Very low and low level radioactive waste account for over 90%(which account for 1% of radioactivity) and intermediate for about 6-7%(which accounts to about 4% of radioactivity). But this varies from reactor to reactor and policy to policy.

For instance in the UK.

https://nda.blog.gov.uk/2017/04/03/how-much-radioactive-waste-is-there/

HLW accounts for 0.03% of all waste. For France it's 0.2%.

Waste like this can be repurposed and reused in Breeder reactors or other methods as detailed here.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reprocessing

The main historic and current process is Purex, a hydrometallurgical process. The main prospective ones are electrometallurgical â often called pyroprocessing since it happens to be hot. With it, all actinide anions (notably U &amp; Pu) are recovered together.

Used fuel contains a wide array of nuclides in varying valency states. Processing it thus inherently complex chemically, and made more difficult because many of those nuclides are also radioactive.

The composition of reprocessed uranium (RepU) depends on the initial enrichment and the time the fuel has been in the reactor, but it is mostly U-238. It will normally have less than 1% U-235 (typically about 0.5% U-235) and also smaller amounts of U-232 and U-236 created in the reactor. The U-232, though only in trace amounts, has daughter nuclides which are strong gamma-emitters, making the material difficult to handle. However, once in the reactor, U-232 is no problem (it captures a neutron and becomes fissile U-233). It is largely formed through alpha decay of Pu-236, and the concentration of it peaks after about 10 years of storage.

The U-236 isotope is a neutron absorber present in much larger amounts, typically 0.4% to 0.6% â more with higher burn-up â which means that if reprocessed uranium is used for fresh fuel in a conventional reactor it must be enriched significantly more (e.g. up to one-tenth more) than is required for natural uraniumb. Thus RepU from low burn-up fuel is more likely to be suitable for re-enrichment, while that from high burn-up fuel is best used for blending or MOX fuel fabrication.

The other minor uranium isotopes are U-233 (fissile), U-234 (from original ore, enriched with U-235, fertile), and U-237 (short half-life beta emitter). None of these affects the use of handling of the reprocessed uranium significantly. In the future, laser enrichment techniques may be able to remove these isotopes.

Reprocessed uranium (especially from earlier military reprocessing) may also be contaminated with traces of fission products and transuranics. This will affect its suitability for recycling either as blend material or via enrichment. Over 2002-06 USEC successfully cleaned up 7400 tonnes of technetium-contaminated uranium from the US Department of Energy.

Most of the separated uranium (RepU) remains in storage, though its conversion and re-enrichment (in UK, Russia and Netherlands) has been demonstrated, along with its re-use in fresh fuel. Some 16,000 tonnes of RepU from Magnox reactors in UK has been usedc to make about 1650 tonnes of enriched AGR fuel. In Belgium, France, Germany and Switzerland over 8000 tonnes of RepU has been recycled into nuclear power plants. In Japan the figure is over 335 tonnes in tests and in India about 250 t of RepU has been recycled into PHWRs. In Russia RepU is used in all fresh RBMK fuel, and over 2500 tonnes has been recycled thus. Allowing for impurities affecting both its treatment and use, RepU value has been assessed as about half that of natural uranium.

With all due respect to those countries, but they should be considered freaks.

Socially, economically as well as ecologically they are the gold standard. Most of the world isn't like them. 

Now imagine how nuclear waste is treated in countries with less rigid ecological laws, where maybe once in a while a law to protect nature is changed for a bit more profit. Or maybe worker safety loosened for a bit more profit. Or maybe the once stable government is overthrown by freedom fighters, foreign forces, religious or political fanatics. Or lets say a freak incident occurs and a earthquake causes a tsunami and both hit the facilities. I admit, the last one is pretty outlandish.

Or, let's say, none of that happens and it's simply the passing of time. Imagine our societies in the 1800s. Which nations stayed the same? Where did we have 200 years of peace?

These facilities need a highly developed technological structure for safe maintenance if we don't want to risk pollution of the future world. None of us can guarantuee that for the future. No one. And even less so given the ecological and political news that are hitting us everyday.

&gt; Der  Staatsrat  hat  in  der  Zeit  des  provisorischen  Regimes  die  Frage  des  Staatswappens  und des  Staatssiegels  beraten  und  sich  endlich  entschlossen,  die  Frage  der  Konstituierenden Nationalversammlung  vorzubehalten.  Ein  BeschluÃ  des  Staatsrates  hatte  ein  Emblem  in Aussicht  genommen,  das  die  drei  HauptstÃ¤nde  der  Gesellschaft,  BÃ¼rger,  Bauer  und  Arbeiter symbolisch  darstellt  und  in  der  Wahl  der  Farben  schwarz  rot  gold  zugleich  die  nationale Zusammensetzung   der   Republik   DeutschÃ¶sterreichs   versinnbildlicht.   Auf   Grund   dieser Anregung  hat  das  frÃ¼her  bestandene  Staatssiegelamt eine  Konkurrenz  veranstaltet,  aus  der eine  lange  Reihe  von  EntwÃ¼rfen  hervorgegangen  ist. Die  Fachleute  der  Heraldik  bemÃ¤ngelten an  den  meisten  dieser  EntwÃ¼rfe,  daÃ  sie  zu  sehr  an die  modernen  Firmenzeichen,  an  die 
&gt; geschÃ¼tzten Marken und Muster des Handelsrechts erinnern, und fordern ein Wappen, das sich gerade wegen seines heraldischen Charakters als Staatsemblem von Privatemblemen wirksam unterscheidet.  Die  Symbolik  der  StÃ¤nde  mÃ¼sse  in  einer  diskreteren  Form  angebracht  werden als  in  den  meisten  EntwÃ¼rfen.  Auf  Grund  dieser  fachmÃ¤nnischen  ErwÃ¤gungen  hat  sich  die Staatsregierung   entschlossen,   das   vorliegende   einfache   und   ganz   den   heraldischen 
&gt; GrundsÃ¤tzen entsprechende Wappen der Konstituierenden Nationalversammlung zur Annahme zu empfehlen. 
&gt; 
&gt; Als  Zeichen  der  Staatlichkeit  Ã¼berhaupt  fungiert  der  Adler.  Die  Vereinigten  Staaten  von Nordamerika,  Mexiko  und  Polen  bedienen  sich  des  Adlers.  Die  Annahme,  daÃ  der  Adler  ein monarchisches  Zeichen  sei,  ist  ein  Vorurteil.  Der  Adler  war  das  Symbol  der  Legionen  der rÃ¶mischen Republik. Er versinnbildlicht die SouverÃ¤nitÃ¤t des Staates. Der einkÃ¶pfige Adler trÃ¤gt auf  der  Brust  ein  Wappenschild,  das  rot-weiÃ-rote  Bindenschild  ist  nicht  das  Schild  eines Herrscherhauses,   auch   nicht   das   der   Babenberger,   sondern   das   Zeichen   des   Landes Ãsterreich  in  der  Zeit  der  Babenberger  gewesen  und war  schon vor  diesem  fÃ¼rstlichen Geschlechte landesÃ¼blich. Die drei Symbole Sichel, Hammer und Mauerkrone werden von dem 
&gt; Adler getragen. Auch diese drei Sinnbilder sind der Heraldik gelÃ¤ufig und so diskret angebracht, daÃ sie durchaus nicht aufdringlich wirken. 
&gt; Da das Wappen die Aufgabe hat, Ãmter und Anstalten als staatlich zu bezeichnen, kommt viel darauf an, daÃ die BevÃ¶lkerung dieses von allen anderen Abzeichen unterschiedene Abzeichen sofort als staatliches Kennzeichen versteht und achtet.

885,"I said it multiple times already in this thread, but communism isn't a set of policy proposals, or a detailed social system one can advocate for. Communism is aspirational (I'd say utopian, but Marx would disagree).

Socialism is the abolition of private property and replacement by social/common/democratic ownership of control of the means of production. There are revolutionary, democratic and other socialists, referring to the means best suited to achieve the same or similar goals. The latter advocate gradual transition using the structure of liberal democracy, expansion of the welfare state, taxation, and regulation.

My only problem with ukraine is when people praise literally MONSTERS, fighting for independence is fine but the brutality people who massacred polish people in those villages was not fine especially since they were INNOCENT people who lived in peace along side of ukraine people, some of which were even in relationships with ukraine people and not only all of them were killed but also ukraine people trying to help them also were killed.

I do recognize that not whole UPA was responsible for this, but if Ukraine at least officially recognized this part of UPA as bad then I dont think there would be a problem.

I do think that idea of this congress would be good idea to help each side to recognnize the bad stuff that their people did, polish people did their bad stuff, so did ukraine people and so did even Jewish people, like Koniuchy massacre: massacre of Polish and Byelorussian civilians, including women and children by soviet and jewish partisians, another not well know example is Naliboki massacre, mass killing of 129 Poles, including women and children, by Soviet and jewish partisans.

They got around that by dissolving Prussia into the Gaue. That was the end of the governmental unit known as Prussia.

You didn't ask any question

No, the opposite

&gt; Maybe take a look at what his police did, without provocation 

That's why I asked for context in my first comment. Anyway, in this same video you can see a man punching a policeman in the face, and people throwing things at them.

&gt; police are not the calm measured individuals you seem to believe they are, from France alone there are countless videos of police attacking protesters, lining high schoolers up against walls for protesting and joking about it 

They are enforcing the law, and not every policemen is a calm measured individual, but they do these kind of things to restore order. Some of them do it the wrong way, that's true; but not the majority of them.

&gt; your opinion of the police is, objectively, wrong 

As I said before, I don't like to generalize: some of the are heavy-handed and ruthless, but the majority of them works to restore order.

&gt; But hey, if they weren't willing to enforce punitive laws that upheld long established power dynamics we have conclusive proof is destroying the world and be judged by the people on that, they shouldn't have been police.

Decisions are made by the Commission (executive), and the Parliament and Council (legislative). The least democratic choices are those made by states, as that's very indirect and not voted on by the directly elected parliament.

So nobody could use it to harm or kill others (and if someone did, any individual with a slight knowledge on the Bible could prove him wrong).

Regarding the second paragraph (1 Corinthians 5:9-13): You highlighted the sentence ""Purge the evil person from among you"", but  it relates to the sentence in the verse 11: ""not to associate with \[all this people mentioned\]"" and ""not even eat with such a one"".

1047,"It's insanely hard in Hungary to get your employer to document your overtime properly as it is. It is incredibly hard to defend your interests as a worker because unions have been relegated to insignificance, Fidesz's labour code heavily favours employers. Now add this three year law to it and you end up with slave labor.

There is another aspect of the law that doesn't get talked about a lot. It's that if employees consent in writing to modify their regular schedule and do work outside that regular schedule, they waive the right to the extra compensation they are otherwise due - and this extra work does not count towards overtime! For example, someone who is a Mon-Fri worker can be made to sign a paper stating that feom now on Saturday is part of their regular schedule and are therefore owed no extra compensation that the employer otherwise would have to pay for weekend work.

The law contains no protections against this sort of abuse, no safeguards so powerless employees will just have to take it. ",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/a5qtw7/yesterday_hungarys_ruling_party_passed_the_slave/ebr9cej/,Siorac,1544776106

&gt;Yury Sosnin, the lead developer for the Astra Linux team, told the newspaper that in the end, Monotype withdrew from negotiations and refused to sell the licenses. The reason, Kommersant quoted Sosnin as saying, was the sanctions imposed by the United States.

1076,"As I said, I think that a joint congress should take place where things could be openly discussed and facts present by all sides. I'm sure that Bandera isn't like a Mohamed for vast majority of Ukrainians and we are open about discussing his role in history.

And source of information is important. Unfortunately, the view on history changes depending on who writes about it. At the time being I would trust only Israel historians as they take it seriously and wouldn't falsify it for some political goals.

I can't take seriously an article which has "" a Nazi sympathizer "" in its title while I know that he was imprisoned by Nazies and UPA fought against Nazies as well. Yes, he collaborated with them at some stage because considered them lesser evil for Ukrainians than Soviets, but fought against them latter. Making this to the title is a manipulation, to my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

OK. that article is an utter shit - I can't believe how can it be considered seriously:

&gt;Bandera was indeed as noxious as any personality thrown up by the  hellish 1930s and â40s. The son of a nationalist-minded Greek Catholic  priest, Bandera was the sort of self-punishing fanatic who sticks pins  under his fingernails to prepare himself for torture at the hands of his  enemies. As a university student in Lviv, he is said to have moved on  to burning himself with an oil lamp, slamming a door on his fingers, and  whipping himself with a belt. âAdmit, Stepan!â he would cry out. âNo, I  donât admit!â

The guy who wrote it quotes some polish book. How can I be sure that the one who wrote it said truth? Some ""historians"" tend to exaggerate things or make up events just to make their books more scandalous and get more money/publicity. Some of them write book knowing their target auditory and what it will like - not for the sake of history itself. In this case, I am sure, only open real time discussion can help - historians and experts on this matter should gather and discuss it. For example, if someone said what that author wrote he could have been asked how he knows that it really happened.

Married and father of three young children, ""he went to see the Christmas market, and in front of his children he took a bullet"" in the head, his cousin said.  The Great EyyÃ¼b Sultan Mosque, of which this Muslim man of Afghan origin was a believer, reported on Twitter that ""his family present with him at the time of the events is safe and sound"".


&gt;**A 45-year-old Thai tourist, Anupong Suebsamarn**, was killed by a bullet to the head, [...].  He was on holiday in Strasbourg with his wife, unharmed.  His death has been confirmed by the Thai authorities.

&gt;*The wounded*

&gt;**An Italian man** was among the seriously injured in the shooting that killed at least three people on Tuesday evening at the Strasbourg Christmas market, according to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

&gt;According to several Italian media reports, he is **a 28-year-old journalist from the Trento region** who was in Strasbourg to cover the plenary session of the European Parliament for Europhonica, a network of community radio stations.

After being taken care of by the emergency services and operated on, the young girl woke up.  ""She wakes up.  We are lucky and happy that she is still close to us,"" her mother announced on Facebook on Tuesday evening.  The young woman is out of danger.

&gt;**A 20-year-old student from Metz, Lola,** was in Strasbourg for a few days with her friend.  Her father told the Republican Lorrain that his daughter and friend came face to face with the attacker and, when they turned around and fled, the young woman was shot in the back under the armpit.  She had surgery and her vital prognosis was no longer engaged on Wednesday evening.  [...]

&gt;**A 28-year-old musician from the Vosges region**, JÃ©rÃ©my Raoult, who was about to give a concert in the bar ""Les Savons d'HÃ©lÃ¨ne"" was smoking a cigarette with two friends on the terrace when the assailant arrived.  He ""was shot in the carotid artery, which broke the aorta,"" his father told the local press.  After surgery, he was sedated.  He is in intensive care and was woken up this Thursday, says his father in Vosges-Matin.  He was with a friend who would also have been injured.

&gt;**An 18-year-old Vosgian woman from Moyenmoutier**, France, was injured in the shooting.  She has had surgery and is out of danger, says L'Est RÃ©publicain.

&gt;**A 36-year-old Pole, ""very involved in artistic and solidarity associations""**, was seriously injured.  A former high school friend described him as ""always smiling, welcoming, open to others, open to discussion"".

Santa Lucia (or Saint Lucy)... atm, is already ended... But some other Europeans can explain more ""xmas"" celebrations...

Where I live, 12/13th night is still better than Xmas; usually on 12th evening kids puts out some stuff (like... cookies, carrots/vegetables, a glass of milk...)

S.Lucy comes to bring you presents (as Santa Klaus)... But, she ride a donkey (that's why the vegetables...other stuff are for ""her"") and she rings a [hand-bell](https://previews.123rf.com/images/scanrail/scanrail1108/scanrail110800015/10311100-golden-christmas-handbell-isolated-on-white-background.jpg) (soz englando);

When you hear the bell, you must go to bed, or, no presents... 

You have to make a wish-letter to her; and she is basically like Santa, if you were good, presents and TONS of sweets; if you were bad during the year, coal (that is basically a hard sweets that looks like coal; difference is... less chocolate and sweets if bad:D... no kids ever got only coal...).

Usually, in the neighbourhood, someone pass with the handbell (last 3yrs I did it...) in the street acting as S.Lucy... (be careful to not being spotted, kids want to see her...)

I don't know, this is a ""weird"" tradition that goes from Apulia (S.Lucy is not celebrated in whole Italy...) up to Sweden, as the link... I know that in Scandinavia they celebrate in a different way; still a fond memory of mine, when I was a kid... S.Lucy was the best, more than Santa...maybe cuz was the 12/13th Dec, maybe for the donkey, maybe for the sweets... I found that in Scandinavia they use to celebrate her, like, 3 yrs ago... mindblowing...

where I live there is no songs/tunes about her... only the handbell, and the donkey... putting vegetables for the donkey meant PRESENTS (also, she is blind, so the donkey guided her to good kids... ;D) Donkey was the key, as a kid... :D

Usually in Italy, 24th evening or 25th are celebrated with dinner(24th)/lunch(25th)...and the 26th (S.Stefano, you choose :P); if you have kids, usually they enunciate (?) a poetry from school at 24th evening (Santa Klaus)...

In Italy we also have [Befana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befana) on the 5th of January...as S.Lucia, is not always celebrated in the same way across Italy...

-

&gt;Juncker is seeking to use the European debt crisis that is brewing as the means to the ends resulting in the final federalization of Europe

-

&gt;If the EU raises the money and hands it out like welfare to the states, then they become addicted and totally dependent upon Brussels and thus eventually all sovereignty is surrendered.

That seems like an expensive way of achieving federalization to me.  It has to leverage the difference between how good things are inside the eurozone versus outside.

Maybe that would work for a few small and poor states that do not want to federalize; net transfers in the EZ might be relatively-large.  But France is neither small nor poor.  Any kind of serious pressure that can be placed on France would require a lot of money coming from *somewhere*.

You agree to its terms or you quit the agreement. If you buy a sandwich and eat it you owe money, which ultimately can be collected from your account (i.e. as per agreement overrides your ability to do what you want with that amount of money).

In the case of the EU you have a [pooled sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty#Shared_and_pooled). Obviously you will have to trade a degree of internal sovereignty (laws, directives, etc.) for greater external sovereignty, i.e. the capacity to advance e.g. its security and prosperity.

And the UK has done that in ratification of some 13000 treaties over time - including nuclear non-proliferation, or human rights, both of which have very drastic effects on sovereignty.

EDIT: Also one could make a John Stuart Mill inspired case that a Brexit is robbing many *persons* of their full sovereignty (illustrating the fact that you have levels of sovereignty extending above and below the national level just as much - which is particularly relevant for the UK, see e.g. the people in Scotland) ",,/r/europe/comments/a5xjgp/keep_britain_in_europe_campaign_posters_1975/ebqx74n/,devilshitsonbiggestp,1544761219

Poland currently uses 48 F-16 and we are very happy with those.

&amp;#x200B;

F-16V is also the most probable choice for replacing Migs and Su in Poland (some say we are to order 4 x 16 = 64). So we would have over 100  F-16 multi purpose fighters.

&amp;#x200B;

It can carry both great air to air and air to ground weaponry (We convinced USA to sell us air to ground  JAASM missiles -370 and 980 km range). With limited budget like yours or ours (where there  is no money for specialisation) it's great choice.

AMRAAM missiles you get are masterpiece when combating other aircrafts.

If you smile to USA you could get JAASM missiles too.

&amp;#x200B;

Congrats.

&amp;#x200B;

BTW - could you tell me how your fighters are organised?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean we use them organised into wings (16 fighters) - where wing consists of 4 squadrons. 4 x 4 (That is why when we shop for fighters it's always multiplication of 16 - like 32,  48 or 64).

Instead western firms employ the most scientists, do the R&amp;D and so on in China. China have let in an unprecedented amount of foreign investment without technology transfers. 

Are you seriously surprised a big bureaucracy will favour their own local firm? Most of the corruption is done at local levels, and many reform have dealt with this. I am not to keen on China centralizing anymore though as it is a big risk for individual freedom. The Chinese state can't simply enforce IP law, although they have done some reforms in this area. The state is not democratic meaning they need to be supported by the lower levels of government under them instead. The state is still a shareholder and have a conflict of interest. A lot of IP theft should be totally okay too, as it would be too costly to enforce for now. American IP laws are not the best in all regards. When entering the IMF most foreign investors knew the laws would not be fully implemented and uphold. They still invested a huge amount of money.

Although estimates of the number of captives taken in a single raid reached as high as 30,000, the average figure was closer to 3000...In Podilia alone, about one-third of all the villages were devastated or abandoned between 1578 and 1583.[4]

In cases such as that facing Europe however, native born workers actually are likely to see wage increases in aggregate oddly enough. This is because all these new workers need to purchase goods and services to survive, but lack job skills, especially when they are fresh off the boat. Companies HIGHLY value the ability to speak the native language and basic knowledge of the country in question when it comes to the service industry for example, and mass influxes also create large amounts of supervisory roles that need to be filled as well.

1465,"Britainâs defining economic problem since the financial crisis has been lacklustre productivity growth. Between 1950 and 2007 productivity grew at an average pace of 2.5% a year. From 2010 to 2016 it averaged only 0.2%. This gloomy observation is often paired with another: that labour productivity is much lower in Britain than in other rich countries. French workers, it is said, can produce in four days what it takes Brits a full working week to churn out. But such comparisons are now in question after researchers from the oecd, a rich-country club, closely examined the data.

Labour productivity is calculated by dividing output, which can be measured accurately, by hours worked, which are harder to track. Britainâs Office for National Statistics asks people how much they have worked and more or less leaves it at that. Many other countries make all sorts of adjustments to survey responses, to account for workersâ tendency to underestimate how much holiday they take, for example. Those adjustments can reduce measures of hours workedâFrance, for instance, marks down employeesâ reported hours by nearly 20%â[boosting apparent productivity.](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/images/print-edition/20181215_BRC047.png)

Introducing adjustments that are common elsewhere to the British data increases measured labour productivity by 10%, the oecd estimates. That closes the shortfall compared with France by roughly half, and compared with America by about a third (see chart). By the new measure, British workers no longer appear less productive than Italyâs (which makes sense, given that the Italian economy has been almost stagnant since the turn of the millennium). Another country benefiting from a boost is Sweden, which almost catches up with America on the oecdâs new measure.

The report is no reason for policymakers to relax. Although the level of British labour productivity no longer looks as bad as it did, its growth has still been poor. Britain ranks sixth in the g7 for labour productivity growth since 2010, well behind the leaders, Canada and Germany. Still, there are some signs of progress. Smooth out the data, which are volatile, and productivity now seems to be growing at an improved 1% per year.

Competition for workers may be spurring firms towards efficiency improvements. Wages have risen by 3.3% in the past year, the most in a decade. Adjust for inflation and that is 1.1%âor roughly equal to productivity growth. That is why it is worth measuring productivity exactly: when it comes to workersâ living standards, little matters more.",,/r/europe/comments/a5zkqq/british_productivity_may_not_be_as_bad_as_it_looks/ebqhbxy/,gravitronK,1544747678

I agree that they should import labor but there is a difference between letting thousands of refugees in from a whole different culture walk into youre nation, and letting people come to work in youre nation (not flee into youre nation).

Its a very complex question and it needs balance, too much gets out of control (sweden), but too little is not good either. Tho In my opinion europe has no responsibility to take care of other countries citizens but thats a little off topic.

1510,"I assure you I am not. Though, I can not discount the amazing utility in wielding the ""troll accusation"" against an inconvenient argument, and thus how enticing it is to use. By calling someone a troll, you can drop any pretense of moral obligation to extend the good faith of charitable interpretations of someone else's position, because, so the accusation goes, they're just a troll. They don't *have* a good faith position for you to engage with in the first place; they don't believe what they're saying. And because they don't believe what they're saying, you're not disenfranchising anyone, and under no obligation to give them even conversational respect, because the troll has already broken social contract. You're almost a moral hero for pointing out the troll.

...Except when they aren't a troll. And there's no way to tell.

That's why I stopped accusing anyone of being a troll some time ago.

1511,"&gt; the issue that you're claiming?

Claiming? It's literally the point of Article 13.

&gt; If I understood it correctly, it would make content aggregators the ones responsible for making sure there's no content being used by any other than the owner or authorized person/entity.

Yes. The problem here is that the internet is *huge*, and content aggregators cannot deal with that kind of data without introducing huge amounts of false positives.
Also it's not limited to aggregators. Article 13 applies to all content providers.

&gt; we shouldn't use others content to get clicks and money. 

Nobody is saying we should. But we should be able to use others content for criticism, citation, etc. Copyright law should not impede the freedom of speech.

&gt;  If the papers and magazines and TV adverts/movies/series can't just grab a Google images result or a video from a celebrity and use it for profit why should any other media?

Oh, but they can. For example, if a reviewer makes a video criticizing someones work, copyright law allows them take citations from that work, be it video, images, audio, text, whatever.
The same is true for a journalist reporting on a public figure, an individual making an educational video about how to cover a song, you name it. What is allowed, exactly, depends on a lot of factors, including the nature of the work as well as local law.

The difference between copyright infringement and quotation is very subtle and debated in courtrooms all the time. An algorithm would never be able to differentiate between the two, yet article 13 demands content providers to let algorithms do so. Granted, the article also demands an appeal process, however such a process can take a long time, and there's no guarantee on the outcome, especially for individual users.

Edit: by the way, this is not an imaginary problem that might become reality one day. It already is a well known problem with YouTube's automated takedown system.

And while Hitlers support base wasn't that big, don't forget that Ludendorff (prob. after Hindenburg the biggest military hero in the country) and the relatively popular Bavarian government was behind him and many people would prefer any more autocratic state over the Weimar republic. Of course all this working together was very improbable, the chance of it happening was higher than the classic ""it failed from the start"".

1525,"No, no they did not. And no, we will not.

They forgot nothing, they have nothing to fear, least of all from someone like you.

If you actually intended to do something you would say something to the effect of ""We need to do something"" or ""Tomorrow we are doing x"" instead you are implying a past that did not exist. You will do nothing.

This type of mentality is prominent among people that worry without doing anything. You see this a lot when a policeman or rich kid kills someone and is acquitted. Common comments are ""They think they are above the law."" ""He doesn't really think he can get away with that?"" Forgetting that by being acquitted they ARE above the law, and he just did get away with that.

&amp;#x200B;

The rich being killed or dragged through the streets is an aberration, not the norm. This typically happens when the entire system collapses, any other instance are usually single incidents and super rare. As long as the system exists, the rich have nothing to fear. Because the rich are the system. The only ones they should fear are the other rich, or the collapse of the system. And systems usually do not collapse from the will of the people. Systems tend to collapse when the key stakeholders stand aside. As long as those stakeholder stay in line (military, police, judiciary, financial, moral (religious or otherwise) the mob is powerless. It is only when those powers fail to uphold the system or a greater power outside the system interferes that the system collapses.

&amp;#x200B;

So why on earth would the rich give a fuck about you? Increased centralization and tech make it much easier to target dissenters and clamp down on dissent before it grows. Let the people riot, let them moan, arrest the leaders and wait a few weeks. The people will go back to their jobs and families and nothing important will change. This is why even when a law fails it often gets passed later. People riot, the government makes a token concession and then does the same thing later and noone pays attention.

This is also why revolutions / system collapses often fail to accomplish any changes. IE the new is as bad as the old. Because those that would revolt already did and now are in power.

The big idea in that speech is that referendums divide society and that there should be an overwhelming consensus about the issue. That's why he invoked David Cameron because it's a common criticism that he shouldn't have held the Brexit and Scottish referendums without defining what it means to go forward over large complex issues in the same way that we do so for constitutional amendments. The Canadian Clarity Act did such a thing with Quebec. It's worth emphasizing that the politicians in Catalonia want a referendum in the style of Scotland rather than Quebec for that very reason since they don't have a grand majority.

&gt;There aren't that many rich people here, what you call ""rich people"" is actually the middle class, normal average working people that want to live well and not live poor. And it's the middle class that is hurt the most by immigrants in every aspect, economically because they bring wages down and make benefits inaccessible to the middle class that makes above the government requirement but still needs plenty of help, and gets taxed to hell and back to sustain them despite not being rich at all, and socially because they hurt and restrict the freedom of non-muslims. The middle class is not well cushioned or getting benefits at all. I refuse to demonize them like you're trying to.

There's plenty of reports that Italy wouldn't be able to fill in the jobs without immigration.

The problem is that neoliberal politics or late stage capitalism or what ever you want to call it is killing the middle class all over the western world. It's not the immigrants.

When asked about why they chosed to leave, their only arguments are either too much migrants abusing the NHS (European migrants actually earn more and pay more taxes than the average Britton) or a stupid rant about the curvature of banana which was a fake news.

Yes I believe you established that. Funny how the burglars are probably European and there's the mafia trash problem and what not. At least that's what comes out in the news.

If you don't have a place in society you become disconnected from it. You are personally doing that to muslims btw. People in general want to fit in.

Would Americans give up their guns, if Mexico or Canada wanted it? This is the type of comparison here, not inner-country differences.

If anything it's a miracle the EU hasn't fully broken yet due to massive cultural heritage differences.

1767,"The arguments for Europe are being made every day. Peace. Prosperity. Everything settled by words in a court, which for this continent is untested ground. This seems to scare you somehow - I promise, the old way where Europe exploded in war every other generation is not superior, and is not impossible to return to if we all become jealous and cut off again. If we do that, eventually one or two nations will become big losers, and will then lash out and oops - massive war. The EU prevents that by forcing sharing and cooperation at all times.

I am British, but your argument about local power is fundamentally flawed because no one nation has primacy. I may not be able to trust that Latvian politicians will rule in my interest, but if I can trust British politicians to do so then the worst that can happen is a compromise where both of the opposed nations give something up and both get something too, which seems fair enough.  

You did not win the immigration debate, you lied or believed lies. Immigrants are a net benefit to the economy, it has been calculated and proven repeatedly. Further, we cannot run the NHS or social care services without immigration either. Most of the immigration that bothers people is from Asian and Middle Eastern countries - which the UK always had complete control over, is nothing to do with the EU and certainly has to dramatically increase post brexit in order to balance our economy. We simply donât have enough workers to pay the tax to fund our pensioners, and birth rates are not rising. There will be a huge financial crisis in 15-20 years if immigration does not remain at current levels. This is inarguable fact.

You might be angry about your local area changing, or have read a lot of articles about people being scared of immigration making previously majority English areas into majority non-English areas, and to be afraid or upset by that is your right. 

However, that is an emotive argument that cannot be backed up by facts and if it is the basis of your anti-immigrant stance then you cannot be convinced otherwise - but you should also admit it is not a logical position but an emotional one.

Citizenship is fine, but the number of ethnic Hungarians living outside Hungary is around 2 million, more than enough to swing an election if it comes to that.

But I think Fidesz gave them the voting right not out of pure altruism and commitment to the ideology of oneness of all Hungarians, but fully expecting the overwhelming support that transpired at the past few elections. Elections need to be decided by the groups of people who actually experience the consequences of it and pay for them. Due to our history, for better or worse, they are not such people. 

There are plenty of developed countries, such as Canada (removed after 5 consecutive years abroad), Australia (must register to vote within 3 years of leaving and must ""plan on"" returning within 6 years), New Zealand (must have visited once in the past 3 years), Ireland (must have residential address in Ireland) and Malta (can only vote in person in Malta), that put similar restrictions on voting rights as well.

""The actual law modification document available on the government's website for all to see. It clearly states a week is made of 5 workdays (page 1). On page it clearly says that a work week is made of 5 days, but AFTER 6 DAYS WORK IN A ROW it is mandatory to for the employer to give you a free day. Meaning it's NOT 6 day workweeks as a new national standards as the leftist media tries to portray it, it's a guarantee that if the employer made you work for 6 days in a row you are given a free day after that (depending on what is your job, it's was ALREADY very much possible your boss made you come in 6 days in a row, but now you have a guaranteed free day after that by law). On page 6, there is a much more easier understandable version, a reasoning of the changes where it states that the 36 months (3 years) change is that your contract was limited to 1 year before by the law. Meaning if you signed up for a permanent job, you still had to yearly renew your contract, but now through a collective contract it is possible to sign up for 3 years, which is supposedly helping the employer to plan ahead with you for more years, essentially helping the market as a whole. You can still quit anytime you want, and still get paid monthly. Therefore if you worked for 1 year previously, your employer was bound by law to pay for all your work by the end of the year at the very least, but was also bound to pay you monthly. Now you can sign up for 3 years if you want to, and naturally by the time your contract ends you still have to get paid for all 3 years worth of your work, BUT STILL they are bound to pay you monthly. Nothing changed, you didn't get your overtime pay only at the end of the year before, and you won't get it by the end of 3 years now. You still get it monthly. HOWEVER when the last month of your 1 or 3 year contract ends, therefore the 1 or 3 year ends, you have to be fully paid, so the employer cannot be late with your last month pay in case you decide to quit and not renew your contract.

&amp;#x200B;

That part is not in this document precisely because it DID NOT CHANGE. Everything stays as it is, the only difference is that now you can sign up for more overtime work (as previously you were limited to 250 hours per year, even if you wanted to work more, you could not) but your employer cannot force you to, and you can sign up for 3 years instead of 1, but your employer cannot force you to. Payouts are still monthly, and by the end of your contract (that you decide to renew or not for another year or optionally another 3 years now) you have to be paid for all your work, meaning every month, and before your contract runs out on the last month.""",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/a5ue7m/why_are_people_so_outraged_by_a_limit_of_400/ebpe7bt/,Piruluk,1544717961

1856,"&gt; Nice map, it shows why Poland was the senior partner in the union and not Lithuania.

Which is why I consider PLC one of the biggest historical mistakes.

&gt;Sometimes people look at map, see big Lithuania and think it was some kind of all powerful empire, while in reality it was vastly decentralized state that needed Poland so it wouldn't crumble under it's own weight in yet another civil war.

The civil wars were mostly between King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania for control of GDL... Personal union with Poland is the reason for that.

&gt;If not union, Moscow (and later Russia) would eat Lithuania probably 2 centuries earlier than it did in our timeline.

1986,"Who is everybody? Macron? Merkel? Both fight for open outside borders ever since and at the same time want to spread the muslims to all european countries who protected themselves by giving them full EU citizen rights automatically, therefore allowing them to go wherever they want in the EU. And even then they don't want to leave France and Germany because they can feed off of the social systems the best there, unlike poorer countries. That is why they push for a mandatory quota. Marcon tries to push them back to Itality mostly while keeps inviting in more of them, and they do come in through Spain. Merkel invited them first, and it was kind of okay as long as it was for syrian refugees. Then she invited everyone without documents to identify themselves and all hell broke loose, Germany of full of afghans, egyptians etc. well over 150+ countries have been identified as origin points of identified refugees, and later it became ILLEGAL to identify them as it ""goes against their human rights"". They both made it impossible to tell the difference between a real refugee, a hiding terrorist, and an economical immigrant.

OrbÃ¡n's government enforces that identification on the border at the legal, open gates, and closed the green border because everyone tried to avoid identification PRECISELY because they know they are not refugees, they are economical immigrants or worse, the few terrorists among them. Ever since, the migration wave avoids the hungarian border. I wonder why the migrants make that decision IF they are truly refugees? Simple: they are not.

I would consider voting on different parties, should ANY of them supported the idea of raising a fence. All of them were against it and tried to ask for foreign help to tear it down. All of them.

Therefore I have 2 choices: put up with pro-gov-party juries who are really none of my concern, I'm no criminal to face them in the first place, or have thousands of african barbarians in my neighbourhood and watch them live free from my taxes without work, given money, homes, food, everything we work for, and not let my daughter or girlfriend out alone at night knowing what they'd do to them, as they keep proving day by day in France and Germany.

The choice is so damn easy.

Speaking of lies, Germany's media is keep washing islamist attacks clean stating it's an isolated accident, attacker was mentally unstable, it had no religious connection etc. while the attacks keep happening by known radical islamists on christian symbolic places and events. New year's eve, THOUSANDS of german women molested on the squares and events outside, and the media was ordered to keep it silent and when they were forced to publish it because people raised a voice, the german media did everything to sweep it under the rug what kind of people did it. It wasn't german locals. So what do the german government does? States this is because of men, MEN  as a sex in general and create festivals where men are forbidden to go, because Merkel's government wouldn't dare to say it out loud, it's african and middle-eastern illegal muslim immigrants who cause the problems, the molestation, the massive spike in crime statistics including rape, robbery, assault, even murder, and are EXCLUSIVELY reponsible for the terrorist attacks.

1994,"&gt;Ugh I presented over 6k studies. You are the one who has to be a bit specific when making the anti gmo argument. Plus every time a new gmo is created it needs to pass safety requirements.

And nothing in there contradicts what I say. They're all about specific GMOs, not about all possible GMOs.

&gt;Plus every time a new gmo is created it needs to pass safety requirements.

Well yes, that's how it should be: banned by default, and approved case by case, not the other way around.

&gt;Do you know how a lot of those bio products actually get wanted mutations? You use gamma radiation do Induce random mutations... Like using a shotgun to kill a fly. Compared to the laser precision of your standart gmo or crispr.

There's so much we don't know yet. One gene can regulate several or many characteristics of an organism, and then we're not even talking yet about secondary effects like potential mutations derived from that GMO that weren't previously possible or likely, or the interaction with other organisms in the environment. So, we're pretty much shooting blind: it's safer to use a shotgun than a precision laser while shooting blindfolded, because the range is shorter.

Increasing mutations also just accelerates natural processes. All those possible mutations have likely been tested by natural mutations already, so the risk is much lower. But putting jellyfish genes in pigs? That hasn't been tested yet, so we need to be a bit more circumspect.

&gt;In essence there's nothing really possible to go wrong  In fact if you read the material I so happily provided you would know that.

Yeah, and the Titanic couldn't sink, WW1 wouldn't break out, and nobody would ever need more than 265 kb of memory in a computer.

I don't want a total ban on the technique, just a default ban on the products that can be lifted based on safety testing. Later on we may be able to lift the ban on larger, specific categories of manipulation rather than single GMOs.

&gt;There is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Precisely what is beind done right now. 

But that's under pressure in international trade agreements, because other markets don't always apply that precautionary principle. So that's what GMO-wary policies guard against.

It's the same with comparing electric cars to petrol cars, it doesn't generate the same emotions not by far. The sound and feeling of a petrol engine can't be replaced by an electric motor. It might be better in terms of performance or on paper statistics but in reality where emotions exist it cannot replace. Same with the paper vs ebook debate.

You have to realize that in a situation like this, it will seem that most Hungarians are ""A-OK"" with what's happening, but people in the cities and folks with higher education are not relying on the state media, and are against Orban. They are the minority though. Most of the critically thinking educated Hungarians already left the country, and the rest that stayed are following suit soon.

2123,"&gt;After the introduction of martial law, pro-democracy movements such as Solidarity and other smaller organisations were banned, and their leaders, including Lech WaÅÄsa, jailed overnight. In the morning, thousands of soldiers in military vehicles appeared on the streets of every major city. A curfew was imposed, the national borders sealed, airports closed, and road access to main cities restricted. Telephone lines were disconnected, mail subject to renewed postal censorship, all independent official organizations were criminalized, and classes in schools and universities suspended.

&gt;During the initial imposition of martial law, several dozen people were killed. Official reports during the crackdown claimed about a dozen fatalities, while a parliamentary commission in the years 1989-1991 arrived at a figure of over 90.

&gt;The instigators of the martial law, such as Wojciech Jaruzelski, argued that the army crackdown rescued Poland from a possibly disastrous military intervention of the Soviet Union, East Germany, and other Warsaw Pact countries (similar to the earlier interventions in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968).",,/r/europe/comments/a5sany/37_years_ago_polish_people_republic_introduced/ebov3wh/,DonPecz,1544696527

&gt; # Blackmail through chaos? No way!
&gt; 
&gt; **The head of government in London is May, but chaos actually rules there. May may hope that she can blackmail the EU with that. But the time of tactical games is over.**
&gt; 
&gt; *A comment by Stephan Ueberbach, ARD Studio Brussels*
&gt; 
&gt; Theresa May is on her way as supplicant. She is threatened with a crashing defeat in London, because there is no majority for the exit treaty with the European Union. For some, the deal goes too far, for others not far enough, and some people no longer even know what they are supposed to want.
&gt; 
&gt; ## The best deal - and the only one
&gt; 
&gt; Now the EU is supposed to help the desperate Prime Minister out of the predicament - and make new concessions, so that May might succeed in the miracle after all. But that won't happen. The British head of government shouldn't get her hopes up during her advertising tour through Europe. The EU cannot and must not do otherwise. It must remain tough. The best deal is on the table.
&gt; 
&gt; And it is also the only deal. There are no renegotiations, that is the message. At least at Brexit, the EU speaks with one voice - from Finland to Cyprus, from Portugal to Slovakia.
&gt; 
&gt; ## A lot of energy for something nobody wants but the British
&gt; 
&gt; And in Brussels anyway. Because here many people no longer understand the world: For two years the EU team spent a lot of time, energy and creativity on something that nobody wants but the British. And now the whole thing may still go up in flames. It is unbelievable.
&gt; 
&gt; One thing is certain: There is only one side to this drama that has really been professional - and that is the European Union. In London, on the other hand, the Prime Minister may be called Theresa May, but chaos rules. Meanwhile, Brussels is dealing with the third Brexit Minister. Fabulous.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Success with blackmail attempts on many occasions
&gt; 
&gt; It is quite obvious that May is counting on the EU to collapse at the last moment for fear of the catastrophe. After all, Great Britain has been successful with such blackmail attempts in the past. But this time things are different. Because the Union would completely lose its credibility. And it would possibly give others stupid ideas - in Italy or Poland.
&gt; 
&gt; So the deal will not be reopened, which is also in the British interest. Because the EU would also have special wishes: Gibraltar, fishing rights, trade. Once Pandora's box is open, there is no stopping. And even if Brussels should let itself be carried away by new promises: It will always be too little for the hard as nails Brexit fans on the island.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Europe has other things to do
&gt; 
&gt; Too many people in London are on their own way. Some want to clear away the unloved Prime Minister, others want to be caliphs themselves instead of her. And then there are the British fans of Europe who hope to be able to turn back the Brexit. What the European Court of Justice has just expressly permitted.
&gt; 
&gt; The whole thing has, to put it mildly, gone rather astray. But Europe has other things to do than to give British domestic politics a helping hand. The time for tactical games is over. Dear Britons: ""Thank you, that's enough.""

2212,"This reminds me religious talks that ""prove"" why the god exists: a few seemingly correct statements connected with poor logic. Anyone who seriously studied math knows that every trivial looking statement often needs a surprisingly complex proof.

0s and 1s are enough to express intelligence. All our intelligence can be written down with letters, digits and a few other symbols. We can exchange with emails and have no doubts that we have intelligence. We can even setup a video call and all the data transmitted is nothing but a sequence of 0s and 1s. You might say that the real world pictures we see with our eyes has many more shades that can be expressed with a discrete set of states and you will be wrong. Our eyes have a finite set of photon receptors and photons are very discrete: anyone who has an expensive camera knows that when there is little light, photons reaching the camera's matrix can be actually counted. Did Hawking have intelligence? Oh yes, he had more intelligence that we all have together. Yet he communicated with the world with his single muscle that could emit 0 or 1 a few times a minute. And he was a world-class scientist.  As you see, the set of possible things we can express or think of is countable, not even contiguous.

Then what is intelligence? It takes something (a email, a book, a video) as input and produces an output: another email, book, video or a comment on reddit. A finite sequence of 0s and 1s as input and another finite sequence of 0s and 1s as output. Without the loss of generality we can say that the input and the output are two natural numbers. Intelligence is essentially a rule that takes one such number and returns another number. Since during our short lifetime we can make only finite number of such responses, i.e. write only a finite number of comments on reddit, such a rule can be expressed as a finite list of request -&gt; response(s) pairs. This proves that intelligence or AI indistinguishable from a human can be written down as an algorithm and put in a smartphone-size box.  


That's a pretty depressing discovery, I think. Now some religions, like buddhism, claim that this kind of sandbox we're living in - aka ""sansara"" - is not a real life, but its severely limited version with very few freedoms, and once we realize how fake all this is, we can get ""omniscience"" and finally start the real life which doesn't have limits. We'd probably call it a contiguous version of our sandbox. But there are no reasons to stop there: there are even wider sets like sets of all subsets of a contiguous sets - aka ""supercontiguous"" sets - and they probably correspond to ""superunlimited"" life that needs ""superomniscience"". But these are all speculations. Facts are that the ""intelligence"" as we know it today can be perfectly expressed as a finite sequence of 0s and 1s.",,/r/europe/comments/a5kggs/europe_not_the_us_or_china_publishes_the_most_ai/eborfjd/,qbar22,1544689359

(Besides, it's not like you would have listened to ""us"", even if ""we"" were telling you to STFU and grab your ankles. The so-called left's demise in Hungary started with protests in 2006. And the current government just looooves to organize protests supporting them from public money.

Second, we can look at the politics in those countries, all of which have made moves to restrict immigration.  They're clearly trying to preserve something, and their ethnic as well as their cultural identity is part of it.

&gt;Yet at the same time you recognize they arent homogeneous ans that you have bits of the population than differ in looka to what youd call ""typically Norwegian"".

But I do recognize that they don't want to be heterogenous.  That some wish they'd never opened the doors in the first place.  That many wish they'd closed earlier.  That most wish they had much more control over, sooner.

And none of these immigrant people helped create or contributed to that culture of social cohesion and trust.  Indeed, their presence disrupts it.

&gt;Historically, local communities and governments have sometimes sought to place limits upon speech that was deemed subversive or unpopular. There was a significant struggle for the right to free speech on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley in the 1960s. And, in the period from 1906 to 1916, the Industrial Workers of the World, a working class union, found it necessary to engage in free speech fights intended to secure the right of union organizers to speak freely to wage workers.

Actually, I said one thing and one thing alone. I said that it is good that people from different cultures *already living in the UK* are getting along together, being friends, falling in love, and having children. 

I am not advocating for multiculturalism. I am not saying we should increase immigration. In fact, we could close the border completely so that no one came into the country and my point would not change. I am talking about the people that are in the UK today. They were born in the UK. It is their home. I am saying that it is good if they live lives that are integrated, as much as possible, with White British communities. I think that, seeing as we have a large immigrant population, a population that is not going to be deported, it is positive for cross-community interaction and socialisation. This is good because over time it means the communities will have more shared experiences and shared identities. This is not even a comment about immigration policy. I am not even advocating for multicultural societies. I am merely saying that, in the situation we are in today, in 2018, it is better to have integration and not segregation. I can only assume that anyone disagreeing with what I am saying wants to see either mass deportation or segregation and secluded communities.

2607,"&gt;For starters I am neither Christian nor do I really give a shit about  âChristian values.â Nor do I believe that the second amendment is an  important part of our constitution and should at best be left to the  states. Iâm multilingual and many of my American-born friends donât  speak English as a first language.

Oh I assure you that you do, if you are any sort of a civilized person. If you think honesty is important, if you believe theft is wrong, if you have any values that could vaguely be considered moral, then you do care about Christian values, whether you like it or not.

Do you believe that people have a right to defend themselves? Clearly you do care about English, since you speak it. I'm also multi-lingual, what of it? English was my second language. That doesn't change the reality that it is an important part of what it means to be American.

&gt;I absolutely believe in stronger regulation.

Ah yes, this is certainly one aspect that is changing as a result of the lack of values in newer generations of Americans.

&gt;British describes an ethnic group in the same way that Iberian, or  Baltic does; ie barely at all. Britain describes a region rather than a  group of people. Scots and Englishmen are decidedly different peoples  even if they both speak English.

I never said they weren't. They are decidedly less different to each other than to some groups in other parts of the world though.

&gt;âItâs an ethno-state, except for a significant amount of the population,  but itâs still an ethno-state because we just donât give them rights.â  By the same logic South Africa was an ethno-state with maybe 15% white  population. Ethno-states require homogeneity.

I don't know what's hard to understand about this but if you are not a citizen of the country, then you don't count. As you said, you are not participating in the society like everyone else is. Are South African whites citizens? Ok then.

&gt;Tell me how exactly it is that a Serb or a Russian and an Italian are culturally similar. Good god.

Oh that's ironic. You accuse me of quoting Macron out of context and then do exactly the same to me. I'm comparing them to Asians and Africans, for example. Do you think they are more similar to each other than to Asians and Africans? Relax on the smug superiority complex btw, I can sense it through my computer screen.

&gt;What timeframe are you even looking at here?

Basically before the 1960s.

&gt;The point he was making is that French culture is not one thatâs  isolated and walled in, to exclude others from. His point is that people  like Chopin, Chagall, Haussmann, Picasso, Sisley, Curie, etc. All came  from different cultures and undoubtedly made enormous marks on French  culture. Heâs saying that French culture will not wall itself off from  outsiders because theyâve always contributed a lot to it.

And another way to put that would be that there is no such thing as a French culture, exclusive to France, because it is built from the contributions of outsiders.

It makes a historical difference if you kill everyone ""in your backyard"" or if you go to great pains to either ship them away first, or also collect your victims ""in other people's backyard"".  The issue arises if you mean the KZs east of the

""[GroÃdeutsches Reich](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Reich_1933_bis_1945#Gro%C3%9Fdeutsches_Reich) / Deutsches Reich / Third Reich / Nazi Germany / Reich (in decreasing precision) on the territory of the Second Polish Republic, or on what would become the Polish Peoples Republic (Volksrepublik Polen)"" - respectively.

Otherwise I don't see much more clarity than saying: ""KZs im Osten"", which is much shorter and in many cases more appropriate because it also covers the KZs on occupied Soviet territory, which you would otherwise often have to add as to be comprehensive. Also, you might not know that in most cases in (non-academic) German discussions there isn't even a distinction made between work-camp and extermination-camp. I don't want to excuse any obfuscating language with that, I just want illustrate that language is in everyday use is not an infinitely precise instrument.Regarding PC, this is not *about* PC, this is *exactly* what PC *is* (PC \[...\] is used to describe language \[...\] that \[is\] intended  to avoid offense or disadvantage to members of particular groups in  society).And I should say you are using it in a primarily positive way (being fair, and promoting the truth). However in the messy modern world suing someone for ""innocent mistakes"" (again, arguably suing for good reasons), does result in a chilling effect in the wider society (same as #metoo has done, same as a lot of other well intentioned PC initiatives have done) - which also was the expressly stated goal, but of course comes with ""collateral damage"" or 2nd order effects.

The main problem I see is:It is not going to re-educate any neo-nazis or far right publishers (who are the main threat in our scenario I'd argue), but it will make sensitive people feel like they have done something offensive and are holding back reconciliation for some reason they likely do not understand.

This will drive them away from engaging around the topic, or directly with Poles. I've been burned by related issues more than once. At the same time I could not even count in how many anti-nazi marches I have participated - just to give you an idea where I stand on such issues.

If you combine belligerent language (see original post) with perhaps valid criticism, but DO NOT show a clear and realistic path to acceptable behavior, then that will result in frustration.Particularly when you're talking about a sensitive topic such as German history. The most likely second order effects this will lead to are the following:

a) People will claim they have *nothing* to do with the past as they were not alive then and will prefer motivated ignorance over an open discussion (in which they feel they can only lose to varying degrees)

b) People will become defensive and you get the toxic escalation you mentioned (ample examples in the wider discussion here)

c) You get more people who try to justify their position by false equivalence (again ample examples in the wider discussion here).

d) In our modern media landscape ""your side"" will first and foremost be associated with the stories that made the biggest splash, and nuance and reason can get elbowed out by emotional satisfaction over time. Sadly Poland is currently in a decidedly bad position in Europe (with a few exceptions) when it comes to its image abroad.

e) You empower people who *appear* to protect you from such unpredictable or harsh emotional (or financial) attacks by group solidarity against a ""common enemy"". Enter: Erika Steinbach  
Or worse: driving traffic to stormfront (sadly this is no joke - they do come up if you search for the term and you can guys what the narrative is there).

None of this is black and white of course. As I said context matters. 

If people are not familiar with WW2, precise language is very important, historical obfuscation is not good at all.

If you ""shoot across the bow"" of some sloppy editing in Germany I applaud that.

If you post billboards such as in the picture above statistically you may get the odd nazi or mitlaeufer to reconsider their stance.

But you will always, always, always have second and third order effects that you should try to weigh against each other. I dare say say Garton Ash, who is cited in the wiki article deploring the shoddy language used by ZDF, would likely agree with me that making repeated legal/financial threats (regarding something that ultimately falls under freedom of speech) will more likely result in 1 step forward and 2 steps back, than a better understanding of each other *in the whole* of society for the reasons given above.

FIDESZ got over 2,6 million votes on won. Second place Jobbik got 1 million. If you add together the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th places who each individually got their numbers and not in a coalition with each other, it's still not more than 2,6 million, let alone one of them getting even close.

The very next day, supporters of the opposition were screaming on the street that they are majority, because FIDESZ got 49,6% support, therefore supporters of various parties on the street did their math magic and figured actually THEY are the majority with 50,4%, and claim for this reason the government is not ""legitimate"". Never in the history of Hungary (after the soviet leftover communism was banished) we had a government as legitimate and supported as the current one. I don't see any party with 50,4% support mate. I see one with 19,8%, another with 12,3%, and so on it goes lower. They are all at each other's throats every day so it's difficult to imagine they can be even speaken of as a united opposition, which they are not.

Yet the minority protests against everything it does. The government I mean. And fine, they have the right to do so. But they are the minority all the same - and ask yourself, when these people scream and trash cars on the streets ""in the name of democracy"", isn't it the will of the majority of the democratic voters they go up against? Because it's the votes that created the numbers of how many people each party could delegate to the parliament you know. It's the votes of free people, living in a democratic country, that gave overwhelming support to FIDESZ. You can question their moves, you don't have to like them, but it IS democracy working as intended that gives them the tools to do what they do. You question that, you question democracy itself. The concept of it, that includes the majority leading.

And back to math.

2689,"France has a sound economy!?!?! You should reconsider your parameters, expecially after all the country and even its capital have been raided by protesters for the last 2 weeks. The truth is that France sectoral budget is way worse than the Italian one.

Italy has been running gov deficit under the famous 3%  mark since 2012,  France didn't, with the exception for the last 2 years that consequently led to a popular uprising. That means France can't afford to cut public spending, as UE traties demand, without causing major social conflicts and political instability. And now the country is expected to exceed this parameters once more, without taking into account that France was finally getting out from the EU infringement proceedings over excessive deficit just this year.

Italy has been carrying forward austerity policies for the last 25 years or so, running one of the highest primary surplus in the whole Europe (only Belgium did better during the same period). On the other hand France has always been on a primary deficit, that means  the current government spending has been higher than the current income that the country collects from taxes.

But most importantly, Italy balance of trade is in surplus, while France is on deficit so the external debt keeps rising more and more. The conseguence is that France private debt is way higher than the Italian one, likewise the aggregate debt as well. That should be seriously taken into account since the EU in the last few years has been talking about bail-in rules as a possible measure that could be put in place under certain extreme circumnstances.

Everything negotiated is freely available on the deal website.

Companies have always been able to sue government in fact its needed to avoid discriminatory practices in a free trade union. Many EU countries have in the past negotiated agreements which include a mechanism for resolving disputes between governments and investors known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). CETA replaces this with a new and better Investment Court System (ICS).

The new Investment Court System will:

be public


not be based on temporary tribunals

have professional and independent
 judges
appointed by the EU and Canada
held to the highest ethical standards through a strict code of conduct
work transparently by
opening up hearings to the public
publishing documents submitted during cases.

CETA will:

limit the grounds on which an investor can challenge a State


prevent public bodies from being forced to change legislation or pay damages

2776,"Translation:

The president of the Government, Pedro Sanchez , has asked on Wednesday the independence groups to renounce the unilateral proposals but also a referendum of self-determination with a ""yes or no"" answer and that, in return, raise a ""political offer"" that has the support of between 75 and 80% of the Catalan society . During his appearance, Sanchez has opened himself to talk about a ""formula"" that allows the majority of the Catalan population to be involved, which is why it must refer to ""self-government, the Statute and the Constitution"". ""If they come with an offer of 75% of the Catalan society, I assure you that we will vehiculate it,"" he has sentenced.

SÃ¡nchez has urged the two pro-independence parties in Congress, ERC and PDECat, to ""tell the truth to Catalan society"", which is, in his opinion, that ""their movement is against history, which does not have a social majority that supports him, that is the isolation and poverty and will imply a social fracture that we are living in Scotland and in the United Kingdom with respect to the 'brexit' "".

Therefore, the Prime Minister has made it clear that he is not willing to do as the British ex-member David Cameron and allow a referendum like the one held in Scotland. Sanchez has been explicit and has stressed that ""never"" will opt for ""the example and the way"" that Cameron opened.

The offer of Sanchez has been read by the president of the PP, Pablo Casado, as a new sample of proximity of the president of the Government with the independentistas. In his second speech during the debate, the popular leader has considered that the chief executive has opened on Thursday the door to bilaterally negotiate the self-determination of Catalonia if the independentists in the future add this social support of 75%. ""This in a serious country would be susceptible to immediate resignation,"" he said.


For Married that affirmation of Sanchez is ""the most serious thing"" that has been heard in the debate of this Wednesday. ""He has extended his hand to PDeCAT and ERC, appealing for them to come with 75% of the Catalan people's support and that they will then negotiate bilaterally. That in a serious country would be susceptible to immediate resignation, ""he said.

However, the independentist parties do not make this reading and precisely reproach Sanchez not open to negotiate a referendum when it already counts, consider, with the support of 80% of Catalans. Through a tweet, the president of the Parliament, Roger Torrent, has responded to Sanchez that a referendum on independence already ""has the support of 80% of society"" Catalan.

Torrent has defended that ""the proposal is a referendum on independence"" because he already considers that he has enough support and has asked SÃ¡nchez to assume it. ""Enough excuses, President SÃ¡nchez. Take on the democratic challenge posed by Catalonia without fear of the polls. Let's vote, ""he has claimed.

2783,"&gt; Ah yes the oppressed right wing.

Yeah, because anyone who thinks that more should be done about this is ipso facto ""right wing"". I suppose if the right wing shot up a few more Christmas markets, they'd have more of your sympathy. Let's hope that doesn't happen, but if it does, I'll know whom, besides them, I need to blame for those perverse incentives.
&gt;Didn't say i have a solution

Then it's no wonder so many of the established parties are suffering in the elections, given that they similarly have no solution (except to keep raising the temperature on that pot and hope the frog doesn't notice, and relentlessly scream at it for being a hysterical reactionary whenever it does). You should apply to be a reddit mod -- you'd fit right in.

For what it's worth, there have been other troublesome immigrants before, and we didn't need cattle cars and concentration camps to bring them in line. The Sicilian mafia in the US for example. You know what really didn't help fix that problem, in hindsight? Those like you who claimed that was all just anti-immigrant hysteria and that there really was no problem. 

You know what did help? Tougher RICO laws that even some prosecutors have mixed feelings about. In other words, it required electing people who were willing to admit there was a problem that society needed to deal with. Of course, that was possible because Italians by then were just ""white guys"" so it didn't matter so much if the police and the prosecutors got tough with them. It remains to be seen whether Europe will be able to do what needs to be done given that the people they will have to get tough with will typically have browner skin than the Italians did, or whether the same group of whiny objectors, who have no solution themselves but can only shout down the ones that do, get in their way.",,/r/europe/comments/a5i7t1/strasbourg_gunman_shouted_allahu_akbar_as_he/ebnt75k/,_kasten_,1544653903

With having a single interest rate for very divergent economies and the need to force fiscal austerity at some point against the wishes of electorates I consider the economic benefits to be a lot smaller and the democratic costs simply too high. We can have highly integrated economies (just look at Brexit, they don't have the Euro but they are so entwined in the EU economy it looks like a carwreck when they try to leave) without the Euro. Global value chains in industries like the car industry and other high-tech industries, as well as financial integration are more than sufficient to prevent wars. Furthermore, the basic fact is also that democracies practically never go to war with each other anyway. Just by having the EU as a guardian of democratic values, that is already a big benefit in terms of preventing war. To be honest I see the Euro and where it is going more as the source of international conflict than a means to preventing it. If Italy defaults now and sends all French and possibly German banks into insolvency, requiring massive taxpayer bailouts, wouldn't that raise international tensions? Without the euro, countries are more independent in their policies, enabling their politicians to listen better to their own constituents, but also forcing the consequences of bad choices on those who are actually responsible for making those choices. The benefits of the euro, in my view, do not weigh up against the political costs. ",,/r/europe/comments/a5gmyy/italy_eu_budget_rules_should_apply_to_france_too/ebnivke/,slvk,1544646315

Why? What part do you disagree with?

&gt;Jesus fucking Christ lmao  
&gt;  
&gt;First  of all, British is not an ethnicity. Scottish, English, Welsh, are  ethnicities. The United Kingdom is not an ethno-state and never was.  
&gt;  
&gt;Second  of all, The US as an ethno-state is the saddest joke Iâve heard in  months. Also, 20% were blacks, and the link doesnât even include Native  Americans. Sounds really homogenous. Not that it matters anyway, because  almost immediately after that we started getting millions of Germans  and Scandinavians.

Yes it is. And so are Scottish, English, etc. Maybe you could define ethnicity, because I'm not sure we are using the same term if you don't understand British to be one. 

Blacks were not considered citizens at the time, they were property. Native Americans were likewise not citizens for a very long time, primarily because they were considered to own their own territories. 

Germans and Scandinavians, and even Italians/Slavs are extremely close to each other culturally. At the time they were debating differences between Protestantism and Catholicism lol. That's the range of debate then vs now where we are talking about something like Islam, which is completely in opposition to those values. That is where this grouping of 'whites' comes from, the acknowledgement that Europeans and their culture are far more alike than different.

&gt;Fucking *yikes*. Out of curiosity, who do you *honestly* believe is getting a better education, somebody at a California public school or somebody at an Alabama public school?

They are getting the same education, as public schools trend liberal. Someone who is homeschooled has a much better shot at understanding reality, depending on what program they are trying to adhere to.

Ok, [here](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=ilc_di04&amp;lang=en)(fixed). See Hungary just above Romania and Bulgarian, and bellow even Croatia?

Yeah, worse than the newest member of the EU, a former war torn county. Slightly better than the poorest countries in Europe. 

edit: Let me put it another way, the median income in Hungary grew by 500 euro 2008-2017. Poland, a country lower than Hungary in 2008 and now above it in median income grew by 1800 euro. Bulgaria, just below it, 1400 euro. These, btw, are the runts. Slovakia, Slovenia, Czech Republic cannot even be compared.

In your all knowing magnificience, it may have slipped your attention that not everyone is as constantly engaged in thought with Brexit negotiations, as to divine that you alluded to the issue of the Irish-North Irish border, when you bemoaned the necessity for the UK to forfeit their trade policy to a foreign agent.

As for the matter itself: Tough shit. It has always been painfully obvious that there will either be a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain or no hard border between the EU and the UK at all. Ireland has a vested interest in the UK not being able to uniliterally discontinue an agreement, once found, considering the violent recent past.

The UK has no one to blame for this but themself. They maneuvered themself into a uniquely weak negotiating position and now have to make some tough calls. If they want an open border with Ireland, a country that decidedly wants to stay in the EU, they'll have to take all the bagagge that comes with it.

&amp;#x200B;

But the conclusion I draw from that is that if there is no solution to fiscal profligacy in some or all Memer States, that any instruments that would just enable it should not now or ever be implemented. Eurobonds and larger transfers are instruments that enable greater fiscal spending without any way for any Commission, competent or not, with more tools or not to stop it, because the people in countries simply WILL NOT ACCEPT IT. And conversely, people in countries like Germany and the Netherlands will not accept greater fiscal spending in southern countries which they have to pay for. 

&amp;#x200B;

So Eurobonds and the like I don't see as a solution, I see it as a timebomb that will blow up the EU sooner or later. I like the EU, I want it to stay. But I don't expect miracles from it. And the only EU that I think is viable, both economically and politically in the long run is an EU with very limited transfers (somewhere around the level we have now is sustainable I think) and strong fiscal responsibilities with the Member States themselves. Everybody should clean up their own mess. I am afraid that may not be compatible with the Euro, so I would rather see a gentle dismantlement of the common currency before that too becomes a timebomb that blows up the EU.

What? Cause they actually didn't agree immediately? Remember that a negotiation has two sides and the EU not saying yes and being picky is ""making it as difficult as possible""?

Here is how ""as difficult as possible"" would look like:
The EU says: Either you stay or there wont be a deal (aka trying to make you afraid to leave).
What would follow would be massive debates in the UK and it would end with either a no-deal scenario in which the EU continues to exist while having to deal with a lot less damage than the UK. 


In reality, this is a discussion in which the EU has a lot more chips to spend than the UK. If you believe that a large organisation is doing something out of spite then you are being really dumb. The EU is trying to strike a bargain which is best for them and the UK is trying to strike a bargain which is best for them. That is completely normal. The EU and UK are both run by human beings with the same desires. Its not gonna be easy to get to a deal but either way it could be much worse. Im not saying the situation is great. Actually far from being great. However, saying that its ""All the EUs fault for making it sooooo hard to leave"" is dumb. If you want to leave then take the no-deal and go already.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_immunity

&gt;Parliamentary immunity, also known as legislative immunity, is a system in which members of the parliament or legislature are granted partial immunity from prosecution. Before prosecuting, it is necessary that the immunity be removed, usually by a superior court of justice or by the parliament itself. This reduces the possibility of pressing a member of the parliament to change his or her vote by fear of prosecution. 

-

&gt;**Members of the United States Congress enjoy a similar parliamentary privilege as members of the British Parliament; that is, they cannot be prosecuted for anything they say on the floor of the House or Senate. They also enjoy the right to be present in Congress: that is, they may be in prison or jail the rest of the time, but they have the right to attend Congressional sessions, speak on the floor, vote, etc**. These rights are specified in the Constitution and have been fairly uncontroversial in U.S. history.

If a vote cannot be taken away for a *crime*, I fail to understand how it is sensible to let any other institution remove the vote.  I had no idea that this was possible in the UK.

3256,"&gt;From Commercy, we therefore call for the creation throughout France of  popular committees, which function in regular general assemblies. Places  where speech is liberated, where one dares to express oneself, to train  oneself, to help one another. If there must be delegates, it is at the  level of each local yellow vests people's committee, closer to the voice  of the people. With imperative, revocable, and rotating mandates. With  transparency. With trust.

OK but how will this function for different parts of France? What will happen if richer communities want something that could be detrimental to poorer communities?

How will those committees work with rich and poorer members in them? How will you police corruption in the committees or between committees? How do you stop big corporations from influencing votes directly through their employees? How will you vote nation wide taxes, immigration policies, international trade agreements?

&gt; Mostly good people

I hope this is just you being misinformed. The NKVD was a major torture organ, with their infamous torture cellars being easily as bad as anything the Gestapo did. This was not an exception. It was policy. Torture was systematic, and supposed to extract confessions from the ""enemies of the people"". These ""enemies"", as you know, were very often simply people denounced by their neighbors or ones who cracked a joke about Stalin.

&gt; The most popular methods of extracting confessions include slowly ripping off fingernails, [and] applying âtemple screwsâ [i.e., clamps that crush the victimâs skull], and putting on âAmerican handcuffs.â The last named method causes the skin on oneâs hands to burst and the blood to flow from underneath oneâs fingernails. The torture is applied passionlessly in a premeditated manner. Those who faint are revived with a morphine shot. Before the torture session [ensue] some receive booster shots. The torturers strictly observe the opinion of the supervising interrogating officer whether it is acceptable to allow [those] interrogated to die [â¦.] At the infamous Lublin Castle [prison], because of the injuries inflicted during interrogation, mortality among the political prisoners reaches 20 persons per week.",,/r/europe/comments/a57dgy/putins_east_german_identity_card_found_in_stasi/ebmfxm3/,karisz,1544610522

Lastly, a representative president doesn't have nearly the same (if any) tourism attracting powers as a monarch.

3447,"Yes this is how things work. But broadly speaking it's all a bit overwrought. Europe today is not Europe of 1933. We don't have a huge number of veterans from historys most bloody war. The largest country on Earth wasn't just completely taken control over by Stalin with public show trials. Europeans today also have history as a guide about what mistakes to avoid making with popular elections. In the 1930s democracy was pretty new to many European countries.

The truth is media attacks on populists like Salvini were pretty ineffective at halting his success. The only thing that could stop a legitimate right wing success electorally is confirming the critics worst derisions. Orban and Salvini instead show the media and business elite for the fools they are.

In any case i don't really have much to add. I hope you don't harbor hate for every person of Jewish descent because many Jews have a deeply flawed perspective on Europes affairs. I think most people who have met Jews in real life knows that most of the time they're pretty industrious and reasonable people. But the paranoia is real and the family stories virtually all Jews have heard puts that fear in their heart. That fear is what causes many Jews to feel an obligation to advocate for what are ultimately foolish causes.

In any case islamification of Europe makes no sense for Jews. Lets say in the worst case scenario, Europe is islamized completely - well, muslims hate Jews far more passionately than any Europeans really. Israel would be surrounded for thousands of miles by Muslim countries. Hardly something to try to advance strategically.

Obviously that will never happen. I would fight to the death to prevent an islamified europe. But I'm not worried about that ever happening because Europe has defeated far more difficult enemies and honestly even now the populist governments have largley stopped the migrants and are now working on deporting those who remain.",,/r/europe/comments/a55nxj/our_manifesto_to_save_europe_from_itself_we_need/ebmbtl7/,OrchidCuck420,1544603110

They have been open about knowing they won't be able to do all of it because they are not going to win but they are going to try to get something done, I agree that we have to do something in regard to natality because Spain has fewer babies being born than Japan, we have a huge problem one of worst natality percentages in the world, they are the only party denouncing the discrimination of the law against women (Ciudadanos did the same when they started but they backtracked fast), for a while now I have been discontent with how the EU works, and since Puigdemont tour happened my opinion is even worse though I am still Europeist I believe we should.

Check out Andrej Holm. Guy was a sociology professor and got incarcerated into solitary confinement for a couple months as well as charged with being member of a terror organization.

- Intellectually capable to write pamphlets for the group.
- Had access to a library so it is possible he could have done research necessary to create pamphlets
- Sometimes left the house without his cellphone so it is possible he did so for conspiratorial reasons
- One of the attacks happened on the birthday of his son
- The terror group in question used the word ""gentrification"" also used in Andrej Holms publications
- Went on a G20 demo

3605,"A cut of government spending has zero, *zero* to do with an increase of exports. There is literally no connection between the two. And as for wage deflation, thatâs not something that happens only when austerity is implemented and even less only within the euro, as proved by the fact that in all these years since the financial crisis not a single country (excluding Greece) has seen a fall in real wages bigger than the UKâs one, a country that isnât even in the euro.

As for Germany, who are you to decide which is the right public investment ratio, and why are you being so dogmatic in believing that itâs Germanyâs gross fixed capital formation that is low, instead of for example thinking that Italyâs and Franceâs ratios are simply too high? (By the way, you linked 2 times to the same image). As for wages in Germany, you havenât actually proved anything because you havenât presented a comparison between the productivity change and the real wages change for the determined time period. And even if you would, thatâd still change nothing, because as far as I know itâs not illegal to keep wage growth below productivity growth to gain some competitiveness at the same time. 

And your view of the early 2000s is very fallacious. Those countries started to borrow a lot not because the euro somehow made German goods âcheaperâ, but because thanks to the euro they were offered borrowing rates that were similar to those of Germany. But if there were lenders that erroneously lent money cheaply to countries that didnât deserve those rates because their economic fundamentals didnât guarantee such rates, there were also borrowers (always two sides of the same coin) that profited from such cheap money. That cheap money was the greatest gift and a rare occasion, but they squandered it by not improving economic fundamentals. It wasnât primarily the âstrongâ euro, but the cheap interest rates, that caused this supposed âinvasionâ of German goods. Also, while weâre at it, letâs really look at the German trade balance with the various countries. Germanyâs trade balance with Euro Area member countries is minuscule, irrelevant, a drop in the ocean surplus. Then thereâs a very sizeable trade surplus with non-Euro Area EU countries (primarily the U.K.), and then a gigantic surplus with the rest of the World. That 
alone contradicts everything you just said about the flooding of the Southern European countriesâ markets with German goods.

Thereâs actually no logical fallacy in my second paragraph. You say that âitâs impossible to answer back without getting stuck in a loop.â Thatâs the whole point, the two things are inseparable. 
Then you mention a lot of things that supposedly influence the value of a currency (âproductivity, value added distribution, country growth, political stability, economic policies, market confidence, quality of instruction etc.â), without realising that every single one of those things influences exports, and as a consequence, the trade balance, too. 

I repeat, if you want to believe in mercantilism, then itâs pretty obvious that the value of the currency should reflect the âtradeâ balance, and that if thatâs not the case then we can determine whether the currency is undervalued or overvalued by looking at the âtradeâ balance.
And if you donât want to believe in mercantilism, then whatâs the problem? If you donât believe in mercantilism, there shouldnât be any problem even if Italy had a trade deficit, there shouldnât be a problem at all even if Germany really had an undervalued currency for its economy because the trade balance would be irrelevant to you anyway. A trade surplus would not be an indication of economic success and a trade deficit wouldnât be an indication of economic failure if you consider mercantilism wrong, which would mean that the entire discussion from the very beginning was pointless and counterproductive because youâd have to look at other things, not a the trade balance, to explain Italyâs problems.

And just as a last point, you shouldnât even look just at the trade balance, you should actually at most look at the current account balance. And even in this case, Italy has a current account surplus (and a very significant one at that, near 3% of GDP), again indicating that the euro is not too strong a currency for Italy.

This is what perplexes me.

Why do radical Islamists, who are literally filming themselves committing atrocities and pledging allegiance to IS (among others groups) on youtube and liveleak today, get a pass?  How many hundreds or thousands of IS members have returned to Europe after doing a tour(s) in Syria?  Why isn't that allegiance on par with the Nazis?  They have committed genocide, bragged about it, and broadcast it to the world.  Why are they allowed to roam free?  There's no evidence on an individual basis maybe?

Judiciary is not a branch of their own government.

PiS is quite left wing in economy matters. 500+ is classically left wing move. They are conservative in social and religious matters, pro EU as confederation, populist in some actions and rhetorics. They openly push for to much control and power, something previous governments also did but covertly, in white gloves. 

PO are neo liberals, elitists. Their inept rule, various scandals and massive blunders led to their dawnfall and PiS winning in 2015. No positive message since then, they focus on being anti-PiS.

Got denied a cat over those guidelines back when i was a Teen. Wanted to adopt a old one to give her a nice retirement when i lived with my dad and left my cats with my mom. (Why take them from everything they know for my selfish reasons ? One of the is now living with me because she couldnt be let out anymore safely)

We lived in the 3. Floor and i got the ok from dad for ONE Cat. I picked an old one that didnt get along with others and never been outside for that reason. 

I had the time, the money and knew how to care for a cat. Got denied for the reasons she would be alone from 8am to 1pm monday to friday ans would be alone with humans and couldnt be a outside cat. I still dont understand the Need to Stress a 15+ Senior cat with forcing other cats on her when the last showed she hated everyone or Why to get her outside if shes never been.

So i had to live with that. The gf of my dad at the time had 2 nice Shelter Dogs which made up for that and i could visit them whenever i liked at her place.

3689,"&gt; Northern Ireland's economy and quality of life in the modern day is largely due to the Troubles and political instability between the Republicans and Loyalists which squandered a lot of potential investment.

You don't think any of Northern Ireland's economic problems are down to it being a small sub-state geographically separated from its political centre? 

I mean, it's not exactly a simple thing. Obviously the Troubles are a massive part of it, but you'd have to explain why 20 years on there's been little change.

Surely the fact Northern Ireland can't tailor its own economy because its a constituent part of a much larger state is a contributory factor? They can't even levy their own taxes.

As for Scotland, I don't think anyone looking at Scotland in the 80s or 90s could argue it wasn't neglected. And we're talking about a country with massive oil reserves that should be very prosperous, only those oil reserves have to be shared with the entire union.

If, hypothetically, Scotland had been an independent country from the get-go, they'd have been able to tailor their economy to that. But they didn't even have devolution until 1998.

When you talk about parts of the UK being subsidised or whatever, you have to remember those countries are also giving up their independence to service the union.

3692,"Well two more things are true as well, reform Jew or not. One is that many Jews learned the wrong lesson from the Holocaust. They thought that since even peasant Jews and shtetls were targetted that it didnt matter what sort of Jew you were, what mattered was simply finding a way to survive. As a result many are overly paranoid and fear rhetoric that sounds like it's attacking any minority at all. After all. If one minority is attacked they could be attacked. Nevermind this is is a dumb and careless reasoning. 

Second issue is that there are simply bad actors. There are people who wish to do harm to Jews as you yourself said about some people thinking that putting Jews in concentration camps would be helpful (as if it were helpful the first time). These people try to latch onto more benign nationalistic movements and serve to vindicate shitty media types.

The truth is that Jews that feel uncomfortable with national conservatism like Hungary or Poland, should emigrate to Israel. If they cannot accept national preservation then they shouldn't make decisions that concern national conservatism.

But also genocidal rhetoric or intentionality is not necessary or helpful. It's a shameful ideation on par with the worst caricature of a Jew.

Finally, let's not pretend like Europe in general isn't a little scared of nationalism. Not just Jews. It has a positive history and a negative one. The 20th century left scars in both Jews and Europeans by and large.  Its better to be understanding of that fear and convince people otherwise than to just write it off.

So far the national conservatives have done a really good job of rallying support throughout Europe without having to say  anything remotely like Jew hate bait. And in fact many have positive relations with Israeli Jews. Ultimately I think Western European right wing parties will strongly resemble Orbans party after the last decades experience. Maybe that's a lesson well learned. It seems Italy has addressed it's migrant concerns with good haste after electing a national conservative. And as national conservative influence grows more progress will be made improving the situation. Right wing parties are also becoming more national conservative in their policy and rhetoric too and that's also helpful.",,/r/europe/comments/a55nxj/our_manifesto_to_save_europe_from_itself_we_need/ebm4ph7/,OrchidCuck420,1544592945

I don't think so; ""no change"" vs ""massive upheaval for decades"" should take more than 50/50, proportionately more with the scale of the upheaval and change.

4041,"One big annoyance I have with the predictions is that they are not falsifiable in real time. Meaning that if someone says that there will be way more tornadoes in the future if temperatures rises more I can't prove them wrong at the time prediction is made just because we're not in the future yet. 

This rice prediction is pretty neat because you listed a bit older study from a ""historic year"" of 2011 and in the mean time temperaturs increased at the fastest rate. I have to give you some credit because normally climate alarmists cite very current studies because they know that it's hard to refute something that hasn't happened yet. So let's see how did their prediction go. By all means the rice yields should be drastically reduced because of the increase in mean temperatures

At the time world rice production was at 449.3 mmt with the yield of 4.25 mt/hectar ([see table 9](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/5q47rn72z/t148fh59f/pr76f387g/worldag-production-12-10-2009.pdf)). Six years later the world rice production was at 490.8 mmt with the yeild of 4.51 mt/hectar ([see table 9](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/5q47rn72z/qj72pc12b/sj1395841/production.pdf)). That's 6.1% increase in yield despite the global temperatures increasing at the fastest rate in the same period by [whopping 0.33 Â°C according to NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/). 

Why didn't this significant further increase in mean temperature reduce rice yields drastically? Quite the opposite, the yields drastically increased by 6% in only 6 years. 1% annual increase is phenomenal. Why? Because like I said in [my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/a578xp/if_climate_scientists_ruled_the_world_abandon/ebkovjy/) - science gets hijacked by **S**cience and it is used for political purposes. Those people are not dumb and they are not just making silly mistakes over and over again. It's pretty obvious that CO2 levels and temperatures are generally the limiting factors in terms of growth. Without sufficient CO2 levels plants can't grow. Without sufficient temperatures plants can't grow (winters are not known as a great agricultural season). I don't know what's the ceiling, but as sure as hell doesn't seem we're close to hitting it yet. We had way way higher temperatures and CO2 levels in the past and life was prospering unbelievably. So what makes Scientists reach a conclusion that yields will suddenly start **drastically** declining if temperatures rise? Maybe politics, maybe funding, maybe just towing the line, but it sure as hell was not science. And as in line with our fundamental biological understandings it turned out that they were wrong. They should do more science and less **S**cience. Politics should not be a factor in determining a sound scientific conclusion.

4137,"&gt;As the article said, it's **the result of an initiative** by the Trump administration, and both governments were involved. It's very much a deal between Poland and the US.

Precisely. It's of the initiative of the two governments but neither is party to the actual contract. It is an international contract of sale and nothing more. It's not an international agreement or treaty between two nations but a contract between two companies. 

As far as trade agreements between a non-EU member state and an EU member state are concerned, the treaty on the function of the European Union is rather clear. The customs union is of the exclusive competence of the EU and the internal market is a shared competence (meaning that a member state can only legislate in areas that the EU hasn't.) That makes any trade deal/agreement, such as the one suggested by Davis, DOA. 

It's obvious. The EU is a free trade area. If individuals member states had the power to conduct own trade policies, then third countries could effectively get a backdoor into the EU. China or the US would simply negotiate lower duties with a small member state, import everything through that member state and circumvent the higher duties agreed on an EU level. 

To put it into an American's perspective: Imagine Canada and the US had a free trade agreement. Every good crosses the border with no check. No tariffs are levied and products are presumed to be equally safe in terms of safety and quality. The system would collapse if Canada now decided to make a bilateral agreement with Mexico to import cars at a tariff of only 1% (compared to the US's 10%). Cars would be shipped from Mexico into Canada where 1% is paid before the cars are sent down to the US where no tariffs are levied on imports from Canada. You see then that the system can only work if all members of a free trade area apply the same trade policy and have the same trade agreements with non-members in place. 

To get back to your example: While your example was a purely private contract, let's assume that Germany buys the two Air Force one planes (after they've been replaced by the new 747-8 and they have reconverted to civilian aircraft). That's a deal between two nations consisting of the sale of goods. This isn't prohibited. It doesn't affect trade policy.

Your stance seems to me very US-centric, correct me if I'm wrong. There's some cultural differences as well that fall in our discussion. 

I could talk about the advantages of public transportation that works, of universal healthcare (that removes the need for crazy hours at work just to make ends meet), of affordable housing and education, and just to the point of your bathing twice a day - unless you do a very physical job, you're damaging your skin, so be careful! And try to use deodorants without aluminum in it (or switch to natural deodorants - you'll stink like a goat for a week but then your BO will normalise and you will actually need much less deodorant etc). 

But, again, if anyone wants to reduce their carbon footprint, they can, to the degree that they feel comfortable with. Everything else is an excuse not to look at the truth - that we're all responsible. 

I would love a global government shift, but governments don't always act promptly (think about slavery, and all the other things that were legal before the people rebelled). Until that moment, I'll do my best, and that's all I ask from other people; to try and do their best, for as little as it might be, cause every little helps.

Was horrifying how people time and again let themselves get fooled or simply didn't understand that maybe there is likely shady about the fact that someone sells them a puppy for 50 Euros or less and doesn't ask any questions. I saw so many things I wish I had never seen. 

One of the tricks is that backyard breeders bring out a ""mom and dad"" to show the buyers and as soon as they are gone they are put into some breeding shed again never to see the light of day. 

People getting puppies not realising how much vaccination and med check ups can cost and then bringing them to the shelter. 
People that wonder why their dog has behavioural problems when it's a pup they bought from some guy in a van that stood around at the market place. 

Of course you can get lucky and get a great dog from places like that but with every dog that is not bough through official channels like the VDH, shelters or registered rescue operations supports backyard breeding and the suffering of dogs. 

Why don't people ask themselves why people sell them pups for cheap but don't seem to care where they end up at.

If the borders are drawn according to Greek claims Greece gets 70% of the Aegean Sea, Turkey gets 10% and the rest is international waters. If you include the Exclusive Economic Zone into this Greece can get up to 90% of the Aegean whereas Turkey is nigh locked out.

Greece is insisting on the 12 miles border citing that it is the international standard but there are no other two countries on earth like Greece and Turkey where one country completely drowns out the other like this. Naturally the Turkish side will never accept this and absolutely will go to war over it.

I wish Greece stopped being so stubborn about this and accepted a fair compromise instead of prolonging this stupid debate.

Sure I would be fine with that. It happens occasionally; not for referenda (they are too rare to speak from experience) but for other votes. I like winning like the next guy, but democracy is more important to me. 

I really don't see what the problem with another referendum or peoples vote or whatever is. The only reason I could remotely imagine in good faith is that brexiteers consider it gambling on peoples lazyness, as in people get tired and Remain might win because too many brexiteers won't go to the ballot again. But even that doesn't survive scrutiny. Two referenda in two years are hardly excessive effort, and when the argument was made that younger remainers were too lazy on the first referendum it was rejected as an argument, since those who can't be bothered to vote can't complain afterwards.

4493,"Yeah I hear it all the time since I study in a French university. Usually it's an excuse for lazy caviar left ""activism"" that disrupt actual education on campus. Last spring after the ORE Vidal law was first passed a general assembly was called where the UNEF and Solidaires reps called for an occupation, and then were overwhelmingly voted down. They then proceeded to have their own assembly without the rest of the student body where they voted unanimously to occupy, in opposition to the Vidal law (which didn't even apply to us) and also in solidarity with the SNCF strikers, the ZAD, refugees and migrants, victims of racism and police violence, environmental protesters, etc. etc. A protest about everything and thus nothing. The infuriating bit is that they voted against actually doing something that might have some sort of impact, i.e. marching to the prefecture or the  mairie. Instead they just shut themselves in an amphitheater for two days until they gave up. Nobody cares about 37 left-wing students sitting in a classroom in Grand Est, it was a joke.

French student activism is farcical, kids roleplaying like it's 1968 again and they don't have a clue.

Because there are a few specific genes that are very discriminate among races.

It's like books written by two authors with similar writing styles :

You can just look at the front page and blindly trust whose name it is written, but if you read the contents of the books, you will find many books have stories closer to stories from the other author than from the same author.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit :** To be clear : the concept of race has been created and is solely based on appearance and population migration, then we constructed arbitrary DNA tests that complied with our percieved reality.

If you went the other way around, by  sampling all the DNA and tried to devise DNA groups, it would be very different from what we consider as ""races"".

Furthermore, if university enrollment stats break âwhiteâ down into its component parts (eg white to British parents, to non-British parents, etc) you get different figures and itâs not clear what definition they are using here or if they are using âoverallâ which gives me pause.

4597,"&gt; spent years empowering Eurosceptics in his party in order to get them to accept him as leader,

That implies that Euroscepticism was only empowered because of Cameron. It was being empowered by the EU's shitty actions, and he rode the wave to maintain attain power.

&gt;took the UK out of the main centre-right grouping in the European Parliament and thus diminished our influence in and understanding of the dynamics in the EU

Utterly irrelevant to the idea that he was a Remainer. You're saying he made us less influential in the EU - That sounds entirely like a Remainer.

&gt;promised a referendum (which the public in general were not particularly interested in having) on EU membership 

The public were very interested in having a referendum. We can see this because Euroscepticism was booming in the years leading up, and from the fact that the status quo did NOT win that vote - If the public weren't interested why did they vote for the anti-thesis of disinterest?

&gt;allowed said referendum to be conducted on a simple in/out basis

Yes, he allowed a referendum on whether or not we leave the EU to be conducted on the basis of ""should we Leave the EU"". I can't believe you're actually arguing that he was an ally of Brexit because he didn't needlessly complicate the election.

&gt;instituted no checks to make sure said referendum would not lead to a hugely divisive result

What a total non-point. What are you even saying by this? What checks could make a referendum about something people care about, less cared about? Or do you just mean this as ""Didn't ensure a Remain victory""?

&gt;turned the referendum campaign into a vote on his leadership despite the fact that everybody in the country despised him

So here you go really hilarious, since you actually shoot yourself in the foot. He's an ally of Leave because he was so insufferable that when he campaigned for Remain, people voted Leave just to spite him? And that doesn't at all give you pause about the disconnect between the Remain-loving politicians, and the people they are supposed to represent?

&gt;As for May, she triggered Article 50

Because she was literally the person whose job it was to do that after the referendum. 

&gt;and is steadfastly opposed to withdrawing it

And yet has come forward with her deal that turns the UK into an EU vassal-state. She opposes withdrawing it, in favor of a fate which gives the EU even more power than a no-deal - How exactly is that anything other than a Remainer? Do you not understand the idea of duplicity at all? 

&gt;but of course to you she's a Remainer because she has dared to suggest that leaving the EU might involve some trade-offs instead of a magical fairyland.

No, she's a Remainer because she ""negotiated"" a deal to Leave which is Remain in all but name. That ""magical fairyland"" you're talking about is just ""The UK, but not in the EU"" - She didn't deliver even that, because she never wanted to.

&gt;Not implying so much as stating openly - in order to secure new trade deals we will have to sell off our sovereignty to larger economies.

Not only is that an entirely bogus idea since you just insinuated that sovereignty is something only America and China have, but if it were the case we'd at worst be back at square one, but with America at the helm instead of the EU, which I think people would actually favor.

&gt;As for your assertion that leaving the EU will make it impossible for the UK government to tear gas people

I explicitly said it will make it impossible for the EU to tear-gas the British Populace. Read buddy.

&gt;you may be surprised to discover that UK national parties, particularly the Conservatives, have a pretty long history of supporting major, often violent, crackdowns on public protests.

And Labor has a long history of suppressing the rights of the law-abiding to further the rights of lawbreakers. I guess you could say that having to deal with our own politicians instead of EU bureaucrats is ""Part and Parcel of living in a sovereign nation"", ey?

&gt;We won't be getting independence

We will whether you want us to or not.

&gt;the EU is not a superstate

He says, as it expands its powers, slowly dissolves national borders and states plans to form its own standing army. That's almost the textbook definition of a superstate bud, what would they have to do for you to believe they are? Wear a big nametag that says ""The EU is a superstate now""?

I think:

- Theresa Mayâs deal will get voted down. Thanks to Grieveâs amendment, this means parliament decide what happens next

- Someone will propose taking no deal off the table. Thereâs a majority for that in the commons, so by law the choices will be this deal or remain

- There will be deadlock as to whether to remain or take this deal, so someone will propose a second referendum

If the UK accepts these terms the EU have said they allow talks on a Canada style trade deal to  finally start, all though the EU is under no legal obligation to do that under the agreement but they have given non-binding reassurances that they will.

May trusts the EU and thinks the UK should take the deal, parliament does not and its clear it will get obliterated if it is put to a vote.

If the UK refuses to accept this agreement the only way it can leave the EU is with no-deal. ",,/r/europe/comments/a4wwfv/brexit_shitshow_megathread/ebjlc8y/,OkTelevision0,1544502214

""Charles's body has been exhumed on three occasions to ascertain the cause of death; in 1746, 1859 and 1917.

The 1859 exhumation found that the wound was in accordance with a shot from the Norwegian fort. In 1917, his head was photographed. 


Peter Englund asserted in his essay ""On the death of Charles XII and other murders"" that the mortal wound sustained by the King, with a smaller exit wound than entry wound, could only be consistent with being hit by a bullet with a speed not exceeding 150 m/s. 

A bullet fired by a nearby assassin would have hit him with a much higher speed, so the conclusion is that the King was killed by a stray grapeshot from the nearby fortress. ""The death, which he had toyed with for so long, finally caught up with him"" writes Englund, deciding that the king was not assassinated.""

4854,"Those autopsy results are still contested the two other ones found he was murdered! 

kulknappen!

&gt; Yet this and virtually every other forensic detail has been contested. Examination of Charlesâs hat, on display in a Stockholm museum, reveals a single prominent hole on the left side. Does this mean that he was actually shot from Fredrikshaldâor merely that he wore his headgear at a rakish tilt? Similarly, trials have shown that, in some circumstances, entrance wounds can be larger than exit holes, and while the exhumation of 1859 found that Charles XII had been killed by the enemy, those of 1746 and 1917 argued that he had been murdered. Historians have established that Danish shells dating to the correct period contained iron shot of the correct dimensions, but they have also demonstrated that the guns capable of firing them remained silent that night while only the largest howitzers fired. Nordling, meanwhile, argues that the absence of lead splinters in the dead kingâs skull suggests that he was assassinated with an exotic piece of ammunition: a silver bullet or a jacketed round of some description. Either option seems extravagant, not least because jacketed ammunition dates only to the 19th centuryâbut even this sort of speculation pales in comparison with the suggestion that Charles was felled not by a bullet but a button.

4910,"&gt; within-group genetic variance is larger than between-group genetic variance in pretty much all human populations

If this is true, then how can the police determine race and ethnicity from DNA evidence?

Examples below.

&gt; In early March, 2003, investigators turned to Tony Frudakis, a molecular biologist who said he could determine the killer's race by analyzing his DNA. They were unsure about the science, so, before giving him the go-ahead, the task force sent Frudakis DNA swabs taken from 20 people whose race they knew and asked him to determine their races through blind testing. He nailed every single one.

&gt; Since 2003, DNAWitness has been used in more than 150 criminal cases all across the country and in London. Most remain unresolved. In several others, however, the science played a crucial role in narrowing the suspect field and ultimately led to an arrest. Kansas City, Missouri, police spent four years trying to identify the body of a 3-year-old black girl. Frudakis determined that the child had one white grandparent, a clue that ultimately led to the child's mother, a biracial Oklahoma woman.

&gt; When two women were murdered in Napa, California, Frudakis applied a more advanced version of DNAWitness that uses 1349 genetic markers to peg the killer as 97 percent Northern European. ""The accuracy of the test was right on,"" says Napa police commander, Jeff Tromley. ""They described the suspect as a blue-eyed, blond-haired, white male. When he walked in to the police station, he was a blue-eyed, blonde-haired white man.""

The French have been repeatedly lied to during the last decades. No, their presidents did not have such low approval ratings because ""le French are impossible to govern and hate their politicians xDxD"" but because they were actively trying to screw them over. As it happens with other Europeans, every election, they had the option to vote for John Jackson or his completely different rival Jack Johnson, so they have arrived to a point in which they all, from the left or the right, share the cultural dissatisfaction that, if unaddressed, can provoke revolutions and civil wars.

After having to endure Hollande, their most unpopular president ever, they had the opportunity to go to the polls. Emmanuel Macron appeared from practically nowhere, founded his own party and, with the help of the powers that be, was given a platform on the media 24/7. It is impossible for public opinion to be able to dodge this kind of shilling. So he arrived to the second place in the first round and went to face Marine Le Pen in the second round. People were repeatedly told in the last thirty years that voting for a Le Pen was going to unleash the Apocalypse, so they *had* to vote for him, even if they hated him.

After winning with such a small political mandate, you would think that he would make some concessions to them. Wrong. Not only did he start quickly dismantling whatever is left of the French social fabric, he did so *while repeteadly insulting his own electorate*.

We are talking about a man that spent 30,000 euros in makeup and bought porcelain dishes worth 500,000 euros.

A man that called his people ""Gauls that fear change"" when they protested his neoliberal policies.

A man that confronted a young teenager because he commited the horrible crime of calling him ""Manu"" and basically told him to shut the fuck up until he was an adult and had a job.

A man whose bored bodyguard decided to dress as a police officer and start beating protesters, and after being notified of this *decided to hide this information to the public and continue to employ him*. Not only this, but he decided to reward him sending him to the bus of the French players that won the World Cup.

A man that, after a brief conversation with an unemployed man, told him how easy it was to find a job in France.

And I could go and on and on. I could spend half an hour describing the numerous scandals of this politician, that is specifically dedicated to fucking the poor *because I know better than you what needs to be done and if you don't agree you are an illiterate idiot*, but it would be pointless.

5014,"They're linked: the higher the debt-to-GDP ratio is, the less leeway you have for short term high deficits to compound the overall debt issue. To me it was the lack of fiscal leeway existing already pre-crisis that caused even the most anti-austerity party in the country (Parti Socaliste) to implement soft austerity measures because the overall debt-to-GDP ratio was already in dangerous territory. When faced with 6% interest rates, you're just forced to clean up either by cutting expenses or increasing taxes and the latter is only possible on small scales due to the already extremely high tax levels on the middle class.

I don't put any blame towards those parties that chose for austerity after the GFC, the full blame for me lie with the parties and politicians who in the 90s and early 00s did not take care of amassing surpluses and reduce the debt, but kept increasing social security spending at a level higher than economic growth. I've been on the libertarian side in the early 2000s exactly because I believe we needed more fiscal flexibility to prepare for known issues (aging population) and unknown issues (GFC) ...

This is what makes me a political orphan really: I wanted fiscal conservatism when we could afford it and no one followed suit and I wanted stricter migration which those same 3 central parties also didn't care too much for. I was called a doomsday thinker, but one GFC and one terrorist attack by local-borns later, it seems that the so called responsible centrist parties totally don't care for erring on the side of caution.

Yugoslav economy was crumbling in 80s, being a dictator in a country during that time would definitely be bad for him. But at that time there wasn't a single person to blame, so people turned against each other. 

Tito was a wise guy when it came to patching holes, but he couldn't figure out how to find a sustainable solution for problems. In '60s he started exporting unemployed baby boomers into western Europe. If they remained in the country, they would create unrest which wasn't good for him. In '70s he started getting loans from IMF in order to artificially raise people's living standard. He died right on time when those loans should start being returned. Conclusion is that Yugoslav communism (like any other) was fundamentally unsustainable.

Less vague constitution would be better from international perspective - it wasn't clear who has right for self-determination and who doesn't. So Germany rushed to recognize breakaway republics in 1991. claiming they have right for self-determination while Yugoslav government in Belgrade blamed Germany for interfering with Yugoslav internal affairs.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/a4ysm0/macron_promises_minimum_wage_rise/ebj4n0b/,brokendefeated,1544487840

&gt;Taxes are for a specific thing. The government can't just take all of the tax money, put it into a huge pile and then decide how to use it.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;

Most countries do actually do that. When a politician says that a tax will pay for something specific, they're not really going to do that. It all goes into one pile, which is then divided among the branches according to the expected need while a part is put away for unexpected costs.

Specific taxes for specific costs is a justification method. Which makes a tax more passable than if you just say ""well we need more money for our budget""

Because before Huwai was accused of ""breaking trading embargoes"" with Iran, it was Ericsson and NSN (Which **is** Nokia) for selling exactly the same kind of ""authoritarian surveillance hardware"" to Iran. 

Which is exactly the reason why I call this crap out for what it is: The pot calling the kettle black.

When China does it it's ""bad"" when Ericsson and NSN do it it's ""freedom surveillance"".


Just like the CFO of Huwai can be arrested in Canada for ""breaking **unliteral** trading embargoes against Iran"", to be extradited to the US because she's Chinese, while EU officials, who've stated their clear, and [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/business/dealbook/iran-sanctions-europe.html), intent to break those very same embargoes, don't seem to have anything happen to them. 

So what's the deal here? When the US pulled out of that deal everybody pointed out how that's just another ""Stupid Trump move"", yet everybody seems extremely eager to follow up on that ""stupid Trump move"".

Remember: It was the US who pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, which was the justification for this embargo in the very first place, a fact that seems to be simply forgotten by everybody by now, in favor of the ""China and Iran are all evil, and evil doing business with evil is evil, so now we all go along with Trump"" narrative.

5225,"&gt; It is a way of controlling inflation, nothing more.

I'd argue it's a source of income for the government before a means of inflation control.

&gt; In other words, it matters what you DO with the money. If you give it all to rich people, you're inviting an inflation problem.

Yes, but who's argueing about giving money to anyone?

&gt; The issue is that the richest people have either not been paying tax or have been gifted loopholes and methods of avoiding tax

Quite the contrary. Compared to other European economies (especially its 'peers' in the UK and Germany), France has had high corporate taxes at 33% percent (compared to Germany at 29% and the UK at 19%). Macron has wisely decided to progressively lower France's corporate tax rate to a more competitive 25%. As for legal loopholes -in as far as they exist-, they exist precisely because everybody knows rich people have a very easy time moving their assets abroad. You can either tax them at a low rate and collect taxes, or tax them at a high rate and have a foreign government tax their wealth at a lower rate.

&gt; You can't balance the economy such that most of the money goes to the top earners

In what country do most social programs appeal to the rich? Certainly not in a country with a welfare state as generous as that of France. If most of the money ""goes"" to the top earners, it's because they generate the most revenue. Not because the government showers them with money.

&gt; Eventually, if you keep taking more from the bottom and the top keep giving less, people are left with no choice but to rebel against an unjust system that values the lives of people with money above people without. Hence the French Revolution, hence the guillotine, hence Gilets Jaunes.

I agree with the obvious conclusion that the French are being taxed into oblivion, they have some of the highest tax burden in Europe and are even up there on a global scale. However, what the Gillets Jaunes want and what the Sans-Culottes wanted are two different things. The Sans-Culottes -being economically liberal (to the point where the Jacobins publically apologized for intervening in the market during a famine if memory serves me well)- sensibly wanted to end the monarchy's spendthrift and end the privileges of the nobility (which included tax exemptions). The Gillets Jaunes on the other hand want more(!) government expenditure. If they wanted lowered taxes and less government expenditure, I'd support them wholeheartedly. But they want the impossible: lower taxes for them, higher taxes for the wealthy (who are already paying their taxes by the way, no Bourbon era exemptions here) and more social services.

5267,"I don't quite understand some of the things you say. I think you yourself have some misunderstandings   about how those things work, which is ok, we can't all be experts in everything.     


&gt;Around 70% of the loans ended up in Germany, Austria and France, not in pensions.      

What do you mean by that? That 70% was borrowed from those countries? I mean that shouldn't be surprising they are much larger economies than Greece and being more stable and developed can offer sweeter deals. Also be aware that the reasons much of Greece's debt is held by EU countries is because nobody wanted to loan to Greece. In 2012 the debt the market was offering to Greece was at [35% interest per year!](https://tradingeconomics.com/greece/interest-rate) The EU, Eurozone and IMF stepped in and gave Greece fantastically better loans compared to what they could get from anywhere else. In fact those loan conditions are better than what the market usually offers even to healthy countries, I read recently that Greece spends less of its GDP yearly on debt interest than the US or Italy do.     

&gt; It's similar in Serbia, we take loans to import goods,     

I don't understand that. Serbia is not a communist planned economy anymore, if the country really is borrowing just to import than it's individual people and businesses who are doing that, something which your government has little control over.     

&gt;since we don't have our own currency.   

But you have! The dinar, no? Do you mean that since its softly pegged to the euro you don't ""have"" it anymore?   That might be true in some sense but ultimately you do have it. For one thing you can let it freefloat at any time if that's what you want and secondly like I said keeping it in line with the euro is a smart thing to do.      

Denmark has a freefloating currency and yet they keep it softly pegged to do [the euro](https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=DKK&amp;to=EUR&amp;view=10Y), Swizerland [did the same](https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=CHF&amp;to=EUR&amp;view=10Y) up until 2015 where all the chaos in the world put too much pressure that broke their peg. Are Denmark and Switzerland stupid for keeping a peg or are they forced to against their will? I don't think so and if this decision is good enough for them then it should at the least not to be terrible for Serbia. Sweden and Iceland let their currencies float with more freedom but they still follow the euro loosely, their relationship with the dollar definitely looks wilder.       

&gt;Basically, we are not allowed to produce and export, loans we get are theoretically not possible to pay off, since only money we get is from loans, our banks can not create money,     

I'm not sure what you mean so I can't comment.    

&gt;our private loans are in euros not dinars.   

Of course, if euro offers better terms people will prefer it. Is it literally impossible to get dinar loans? If not then it's a matter of choice and it's only natural a much bigger currency like the euro and more stable should offer better terms that people would prefer.     

&gt;Another thing I'm getting from friends around EU, even from Slovenia, is that they are not aware Serbia is under dictatorship. That's not something easily skipped in media.    

No, I don't think news anywhere are reporting that. In Bulgaria the only thing I've heard from our news is that Serbia had protests last year that accused Vucic of being a dictator. I think media need more time and Vucic needs to make it more obvious for it to start reporting it like that.

Sure sure. Itâs just that Il2, Stuka, modern  ones like Su25, A-10, Apache participated in virtually every bigger tank battle of modern era and contributed by inflicting significant damage.

The sources I linked you to, by someone from America military, and multitude of other ones, say contrary to what you say. I think Iâll go with those ;) 


And no, American tank tactics are not based on Soviet ones and are very, very different. The whole philosophy is fundamentally different. American one was more advanced if looked at purely from tactical point of view. Soviets couldnât achieve and didnât try to achieve it since their forces were conscript and trained very differently. This resulted in very different approaches.

Im not aware of any chemical attacks on the Eu but what does that have to do with Belgian democracy? And there are no chemical tracks on the EU. 

One Dutch plane was shot by Russian backed rebels  and Russia did occupy crimea, which led to sanctions against Russia. But again, what does that have to do with Belgian democracy? 

There is a war in Ukraine, not with the Eu, what does that have to do with Belgian democracy?

5361,"&gt;Telling the governements to do more is not very useful. There need to be actionable demands - Like we want higher tarrifs on poor efficiency cars. We want more electic car charging stations. Our public lighting should be LED.

How about ""I want the people flying private planes and having an ecological print near 100 times my size to pay (PROPORTIONAL TO THEIR INCOME) 100 times more than I do for the same measure?""

I know it's not a popular topic, but the biggest 'advocates' for climate change tend to be ultra rich fat cats. Every single time there's another 'climate top', I barf at seeing these people come in to the whole event. We would probably reduce global greenhouse gasses by a whole percentage point if we literally decapitated every asshole that showed up to attend/speak at these events.

In one day, that jackass emitted more greenhouse gasses than I do over a whole year, probably way more than that. And why? So he could be paid a half a million, be served fancy dinners where 90% of the edible food products are lost in preparation (and thrown out instead of recycled/donated to the needy) so they can make 'gourmet' garbage, and him and thousands of other assholes sat there, patting themselves on the back for telling those ""dirty poors"" whats what and how they needed to cut down on their lifestyle of fucking luxury.

I still have trouble wrapping my head around this. I actually can't believe so many of you are going insane over this. Our masters of wealth and power aren't giving up a penny, nothing. All they're doing is blaming us because they're destroying the world, and giving us a good ol' moral-guilt walloping over it. Fuck em.

5398,"Well no, let me go into specifics.

1&gt; Big red buses drove around claiming that 350 pounds a week were sent to the EU that should instead be sent to the NHS.  Turns out that number was made up.  Any voter who thought that was a compelling reason?  Voted on a lie.

2&gt; Piggybacking off of one, the debates now when UK negotiates a Brexit with EU is actually how much UK owes EU.  So if someone believed UK would save money by leaving instead it's going to cost the UK money.  

3&gt; Citizens were told that new trade agreements would be easy to establish and better once they left the single market.  This was also a lie, so far zero such agreements have materialized.

4&gt; Lie to Scottland when they were voting to be independent that they would stay part of the EU  (that's a tangent I realize but still worth mentioning).

Those are four examples but there are more nuanced ones still, for example, the idea that the UK wouldn't have to follow EU laws if they left, except anything the UK exports is going to have to adhere to EU laws to be sold in the EU, essentially meaning that despite leaving the EU UK would still be forced to follow all those pesky commercial regulations on pillows (as lifted from yet another ad).  

These are lies, these are selling people something that doesn't exist.  To claim their vote counted ignores what they actually voted for.  Maybe if the Brexit could result in what people thought they were getting you could argue will of the people, but it's not, they voted for something that was a lie and claiming they have to swallow that lie isn't truly what those people wanted.  

I don't expect anyone wanted a UK that had to follow the same laws, lost a bunch of money, probably loses Scotland and maybe at best gets tighter border rules (no deal Brexit).  The brexiteers promises were all fake and a vote based on lies isn't a true demonstration of the will of the people.

China is heavily shilling on reddit. The worst is on worldnews but it also happens in other subs. They seem to have filters for certain keywords set up because these shills appear immediately when something connected to Chinese politics is mentioned, even in more obscure subs. If it's an article they don't want you to see the usual strategy is to downvote first and also report it for any rules violation they can come up with to possibly have it removed. If that doesn't work and too many people start commenting they start their usual routine of whataboutism (the US is doing it too), questioning sources, and just straight up spreading misinformation that's hard to check for anyone who doesn't have much knowledge about China.

Quite obviously, this is not the case. Society functioned a lot better when fathers were compelled to stick around and help mothers raise their offspring, and marriage arose as an institution in response to this. If man and woman attempt unsuccessfully to reproduce and cannot, maybe they'll have more success in the years to come. If they still are unable, then so be it - there's no benefit to society to tear them apart, and they still fulfill the model of reproductive family unit.

What you are asking is that we reform marriage into just a nice thing we do with people we like. What benefit this serves to society is unknown, as are the ramifications.

BTW, this is the other side of the argument the Pentagon has been making for decades; not only that Europe's wealthiest nations are  weirdly incapable of funding real commitments to NATO that would stand up to a hot war for territory against Russia (nota bene: if you think Trump is a Putin agent; what is Schroeder? Matthias Warnig? Every politician co-signing NordStream 2?), but that the West has essentially allowed the Chinese camel's nose into its cyber tent.


https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1013807.pdf


&gt;Finally, the United States has observed considerable Chinese activity in the cyber and espionage realms. U.S. organizations and networks appear to suffer significant cyber penetration, which allows China to stay ahead of U.S. Government and commercial
decision-makers, reduces its strategic uncertainty, and mitigates risk.

&gt;For example, non-attributable cyber intrusion and espionage greatly lower the costs of Chinese research and development by reaping the classified and/or proprietary knowledge of U.S. defense laboratories and businesses. This eliminates the normal attendant investment and operating costs associated with research and development.

&gt;The Chinese cyber capability also allows them to influence adversaries by showing Chinaâs cyber reach and disruptive and destructive cyber capability. Chinaâs comprehensive gray zone approach uses indirect methods and ambiguous international legal frameworks to pursue revisionist ambitions. 

&gt;These activities have set China on a trajectory toward effectively contesting U.S. regional dominance and an active renegotiation of the U.S.-led international order.81 As such, it constitutes the most sophisticated and classically dangerous of this studyâs four competitor archetypes.

5593,"&gt;Is a white person wanting to be black person mismatch too? 

There are no such thing as white or black persons, we're all on a color spectrum for that particular fenotypical characteristic, just like there is a spectrum for nose shape or hair type. Only racists divide people into two distinct types, black and white. And as a matter of fact, if people want to change their hair or have a nose job, nobody bats an eyelid, and color change operations aren't unheard of either.

Gender is different in the sense that there are no small variations, so there aren't small nudges to give, it's all or nothing in most individuals. Consequently the full operation only became available recently. Transvestites, however, have always existed, so it's not like it's a modern phenomenon.

&gt;If you own genital A how the hell can you know what owning genital B feels like? 

Humans have an innate capacity of identifying with a specific gender. Usually that matches up with their body, but sometimes it doesn't.

That's also why identification with a different animal can be considered a disease: identifying as male or female is a normal and healthy expression of the human genome, identifying as a parrot not.

5596,"Since you're going to be such a pussy about it, I'll do it anyway.

&gt; There are reasons why in Western European countries, people are richer and in ex-socialist countries people are poorer.

The biggest structural reason for that is that socialist countries were already behind when they got socialist governments. Despite this, they managed to industrialize much faster than some capitalist countries if you're willing to measure their pre and post socialism figures. Yugoslavia for example was ahead of Turkey until the war, despite starting behind or at a relatively similar level.

&gt; First reason is socialists and communists don't understand how economy works and the second reason is industry. There are also regional and historical reasons but they're not the major reasons so i won't count them. There's a reason why China abandoned Socialism: IT MAKES YOU POORER. The Chinese were literally poorer than Africans under Mao. Thank heaven that imbecile died.

How is ""industry"" a reason in itself? How illiterate are you that when asked ""What are the reasons for the economic disparity between ex-socialist and Western European countries"" you reply _industry_?

As for your claim about _POORER_, China's GDP/capita growth between 1952-1990 outstripped that of Turkey. And no, the average GDP/capita of sub-Saharan Africa was consistently lower and the time the Chinese public came closest to that level was following the world wars. The Republic of China saw little to no growth, while the actual industrialization of the country progressed under Mao.

If you're going to make that claim (which happens to be conditionally true), you have to know how to make it.

&gt; and if you read history yes the rich people getting richer will eventually benefit the population because these people will invest in your area, in your country. How? They create jobs, you offer them your labor and in return they give you money. Your labor creates wealth and you both benefit from this. And eventually you'll get richer. This is what happened in Western Europe and North America.

This is where your economic illiteracy is most obvious. Here's Adam Smith:

_Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer. The maxim is so perfectly self-evident, that it would be absurd to attempt to prove it. But in the mercantile system, the interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the producer; and it seems to consider production, and not consumption, as the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce._

Consumers create jobs. The circumstantial distribution of capital has little bearing on job creation, in the grand scheme of things.

Capital investment needn't come from industrialists or venture capitalists. During post-war reconstruction, a huge portion of investment was driven by public expenditure, which is how European states themselves ended up with massive state-owned (and relatively successful) petrochemical, transportation, steel, energy and various manufacturing industries.

&gt; I don't understand that irrational hatred towards capitalism. People act like we have infinite resources but the evil capitalists don't let us enjoy these riches. Unless we have infinite resources or we somehow start to colonize the galaxy, you'll have to accept the economic facts and logic.

Nobody around has actually disavowed living in a capitalist society. In contrast, you're displaying an irrational love of capitalism, particularly its most destructive excesses.

You are unwilling to accept the most elementary of economic facts and logic. The very fact that we have limited resources brings up the question of how these resources are to be distributed, and having social concerns influence that distribution or legislating to curb the most unhealthy parts of a market economy are perfectly legitimate aims. Our resources are limited, why should the super-rich be permitted to command so much of our resources?

Answer this: If the labor force as a whole is becoming more productive but capitalists and highest-paid executives alone get to enjoy the income of that added productivity (this has actually been happening in parts of the developed world, on different scales), what is the justification for typical ""capitalism for (the benefit of) all"" arguments?",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/a4loa0/change_in_disposable_income_from_macron_tax_reform/ebhw82a/,_Whoop,1544452098

Now many countries decide to establish to form their own agreements with other countries on top of WTO rules, for a more open flow of goods and capital. Which is exactly the same thing the UK can also do, AFTER brexit. Because currently the UK is not allowed to work on any trade deals with third parties until the brexit negotiations are over.

If we assume a theoretical hard brexit, the chance of there being a trade deal with the EU in the next few years is still extremely likely because it's beneficial for both economies.

5609,"&gt;That is the leading theory, but hardly the only one. At least to explain all the gender dypshoria reports that in some areas where there is large social media activity about it is skyrocketing among kids and teenagers (ROGD is one of theories to explain it, but Grand Wizards of critical theory studies and transactivists are fighting tooth and nail for any researcher to get funding on it, just see what happened to professor Littman few months ago).

Without a name for the phenomenon, people are just going to call it general depression or something. If you never use a thermometer, you will never confirm that you have a fever, but that doesn't mean it's a bad idea to use a thermometer. Increasing detection efforts will increase the number of confirmed cases, yes.

&gt;Problem, as you mentions, is that we dont really know shit about brain. Cognitive neuroscience is rather new medical field and the female brain in male body and vice versa has been observed in some cases of gender dysphoria and totally absent in others. Thinking is that there is some connection, but social upbringing may be other.
But no one knows. So yeah, adjusting body is easier, but you also have studies that observed GD patients and showed no decrease in suicide rate after SRS. So what gives?

There also are studies that claim an improvement in life quality, so apparently the results range from no harm to improvement, that's a good result in medicine - better than eg. chemotherapy. 

&gt;As a kid, you are unable to consent so either throwing over-the-counter pills with massive side-effects that are primarily used to treat pancreatic cancer and labelling them ""hormone blockers"" whilest forcing under threat of child suicide parent to sign the experimental drug is not just unethical, but in my opinion criminal. I will not even touch chemical castration, any reasonable person must see the issue there at child level.

Given that much of the psychological issues seems to be acquired as result of living with the dysphoria, starting therapy earlier would reduce the harm more.

&gt;At the same time, there should be committment to help these people see theraputical help of licensed psychologists (which should be free of charge and paid by universal insurance) and non-disciminatory clausule based on that. So yes, to help, but not to dogma of ""this is the only way it can be, and must be, done.""

The procedure is nontrivial, take a lot of time, includes extensive psychologist evaluation and there are typically waiting lists for it, so I'd say the barrier to entry is pretty high. As you say, we don't really have an alternative to offer besides ""just learn to live with it"", so if people feel that bad about it let them try it that's the easiest way to deal with it.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/a3yfyt/hungary_and_poland_say_no_to_lgbtiq/ebhpqgz/,silverionmox,1544444455

Fellow hungarian comes to rescue me from answering properly down below.
&gt;You've really misunderstood something, people aren't going to be paid 3 years late for overtime... It's paid out regularly, along with their normal salary. 
&gt;
&gt;The proposal is about the so-called [allocated cumulative working time](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/emcc/erm/support-instrument/allocated-cumulative-working-time) (munkaidÅkeret). 
&gt;
&gt;Basically under the current law, overtime rules must be met every single year. That's 250 hours per year under the current legislation (which needs no consent from the worker) and this proposal adds a """"""voluntary"""""" 150 hours to that (through written consent from the employee). But the same proposal says overtime rules must only be met in 3-year tranches. 
&gt;
&gt;So theoretically an employer could use up 3 years' worth of the regular 250h overtime in the first year (750 hours overtime), not issue any in the next two and be in compliance of the law

Well that's not exactly what's showed in this study. It just show rich tend to move very little. And it's analysed without taking into account if there is more mobility in coutrnies with high tax than countries with low tax

I don't see how that is not backed up by empirical fact. Rich people do move away, even if it's only a small part. In France it is significant.

Same for democracy. We never ever had true democracy and do not have the civic foundations for it in place. You had centuries of democracy and all the foundations for it are solid in your country.

Brexit would mean that the UK loses it's membership status with the EU and all the benefits it entails such as access to the single market, development funds, the option to have a voice in decisions made etc. It would also gain stuff like not having to adhere to the regulations and directives, being completely sovereign and not having to pay certain ""taxes"". A lot of these things have other implications, like now the UK has to trade with this huge bloc and get heavily taxed. Want to trade with Sudan?

Of course this all is very general and I didn't mention everything. But this much should be understandable to most adults. 

What I described is a hard Brexit with no deal, imo the confusion comes when the UK wants to have a deal so they don't get screwed. Why would the EU want to accept British good if they don't adhere to our standards for example. They would have to adhere to our standards to be sold here but then the UK would not be getting any benefit from not being in the UK, I guess the EU could have a lower import or export tax but what would be the incentive?

5874,"Well, everyone a little bit wary of politics and how governments cook the books, would consider unemployment figures as, to say the least, an incomplete information to show really how a country's state of economy really is. The US does have an unemployment rate close to 3%, however it also does have a shitty labour activity rate (around 62%) and guess what, it's close to the French activity rate which is in fact expected to overtake the US one. [Few people highlight the fact that the US labour market didn't really recovered from the last crisis](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JC369_LFPRCh_G_20150625130240.jpg): the US labour activity rate has been constantly going downward (from 70% in the 90s to 62% nowadays), with people not even registering as unemployed but joining the inactive part of the population, meanwhile the French labour activity rate is increasing, and this is a common upward trend which can be observed all over Europe. [As the Financial Times explained, if people since 2008 didn't gave up and went off the charts of unemployment figures, the US unemployment rate would be revised up to 9.3%.](https://www.ft.com/content/0af0f0a4-067a-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5)(""if the US participation rate had remained constant at pre-financial crisis levels, unemployment today would be 9.3 per cent, more than double its current level and higher than the eurozone average."")

Consequently, clearly you shouldn't only focus only on the unemployment rate, and stay with a truncated view of economics.

And the fact that people are employed in some countries such as in the UK with shitty precarious countracts such as 0 hours contracts but living worse off than their counterparts in France without work should worry you more. An economy full of shitty jobs is a dying economy. Some countries chose to erode their social security and century-old achievements (especially under Thatcher and Reagan) gained with lot of difficulty by the labour force, some others like Nordic countries or France for now, chose to keep a strong welfare state, which system/model is better is up to you, as for myself I have my own opinion on it.

5884,"I can understand your point in saying that there are wrond arguments flying around NS2 and that perhaps some people from CEE countries, particularely Poles, making it too much about themselves, as if they gas deliveries are massively threatened. The reality of course is a bit different, many CEE countries are nowadays infrastructualy fully connected to the Northwestern European gas hubs, so cutting them lose would require active cooperation of several Western European countries + they also do not import only Russian gas but also Norwegian gas + they actively build infrastructure to be able to build LGN terminals. I mean, yes, it does weaken the position of some EU CEE countries, such as Poland or Slovakia, but it's not an existential threat.

However I do not agree with you that you can use NS2 against Russia. In what way can you use that against Russia? By threatening to stop deliveries from them? You could do that with or without NS2, but it's not at all a credible threat when you clearly do not yet have alternatives to fully replace Russian gas.

We still need Russian gas, we don't have the infrastructure in place to replace it and they need to sell us their gas because it's important source of income for them.

Not if the anger that fuels these sort of revolts is being manufactured by a constant barrage of misinformation, propaganda, lies, and a completely skewed perspective of the West's place in the world.

This isn't to say that we don't have our share of problems, but in comparison to most other places in the World, Europe is a paradise of individual freedom and prosperity. It really is... Not until you look at places like China and Africa and even Central America do you realize how good we have it.

Yet even modern mainstream media portrays a picture of almost impending doom! 

Compare today's narrative to the early 1980s, where two superpowers actually had thermonuclear missiles pointed at each other and the world came [pretty close to becoming an irradiated hellscape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX83EzDofrc), but the people and culture where actually much more upbeat and forward looking than they are now. And don't get me started on terrorism: The 60s, 70s and 80s actually saw more terrorism related deaths than all we've had since 9/11!

And that's the issue: People are reacting strongly to things that the both the media and the internet keep blowing way out of proportion either for profit or political gain, and there's actually nothing the ""elites"" or anyone else for that matter can do to solve manufactured and often imaginary threats...

Yes.
