230,"Probably the most famous fountain in the world.

*Fontana di Trevi* is located in Rome‚Äôs Trevi district, abutting the Palazzo Poli. An earlier fountain on the site was demolished in the 17th century, and a design competition for a new fountain was won by Nicola Salvi in 1732. His creation was a scenic wonder. 

The idea of combining the palace front and fountain was derived from a project by Pietro da Cortona, but the grand pageantry of the fountain‚Äôs central triumphal arch with its mythological and allegorical figures, natural rock formations, and gushing water was Salvi‚Äôs.

The Trevi Fountain took some 30 years to complete, and after Salvi‚Äôs death in 1751, Giuseppe Pannini, who slightly altered the original scheme, oversaw its completion in 1762. It was officially opened by Pope Clement XIII.

The immense fountain stands some 26 metres high and is approximately 49 metres wide. At its centre is Pietro Bracci‚Äôs statue of Oceanus, who stands atop a chariot pulled by sea horses and is accompanied by tritons. The fountain also features statues of Abundance and Health.

Its water, from the ancient aqueduct called Acqua Vergine, long was considered Rome‚Äôs softest and best tasting; for centuries, barrels of it were taken every week to the Vatican. However, the water is now non-drinkable. 

According to legend, those who toss coins into its waters will return to Rome. I sure did.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/niaj99/this_day_in_1762_the_trevi_fountain_officially/gz0vjmk/,capcaunul,1621657552

If drug usage is a symptom it has no use at all of making their life harder. Arresting people for using drugs will not solve their problems in life. It will make them harder, thus increase drug usage. Think of it as being overweight or smoking. You can't just say, don't eat too much. Obviously you shouldn't but it won't work. You've got to figure out what is making them eat too much, for example increase sleep and reduce stress or educate on the contents of foods and even then it might not work because food is just so delicious. 

Some drugs just feel so damn good that you take the health risks for the pleasure or escape.

392,"I don't think underreporting plays a significant role in countries where drugs overdoses aren't that big of a problem, assuming the data comes from official sources. Even if we assume some sort of underreporting and make it pretty far fetched, let's say double the map statistics, central/eastern europe still stands out compared to the countries its regularly clumped with  (Poland and Russia for example) and most of them do better than Western countries. 

I'd say drugs and all things connected to them are uniquely diverse problems than vary greatly even in countries with similar cultures and economic standards that border each other. Like Scotland and the rest of UK for example. Which makes certain countries enact unique policies not only when it comes to the legality but also education in media, which pills need a prescription, etc.

There's really no easy answer and we can't assume much imo. Given all that, when it comes to Poland I can give you some anecdotal info. I grew up in rural parts of Central Poland and I'm now living in a city of 600,000 people trying to make the ends meet while I'm studying. Hard drugs like heroin and generally opioids are highly stigmatised and very hard to come by. I've met a lot of people dealing and you could mostly pick from weed, lsd, mdma, meth and cheaper meth-like drugs, shrooms, speed and the stuff you'd find in a pharmacy or other medical related drugs, rarely ketamine or laughing gas. I'm sure I'm forgetting some but alas. It's not like you can find a guy dealing on every corner of a street either but you get the idea. Without connections it's really hard to find anything, even weed. Taking drugs other than alcohol carries a heavy social stigma among all age groups. Weed is widely accepted amongst younger people but I'd still say from personal experience that vast majority of young people just prefer beer or vodka.

How do these people become ""community representatives""? Is there an actual vote? Or were political parties just stupidly lazy in the 2000s and believe that chucking money at some mythical ""community leader"" would somehow convince thousands of people to all vote the same way? I mean - it's incredibly obvious that an attempt at pork-barrel politics like this is just going to have every grifter showing up to claim they could deliver all those votes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;These groups can exercise disproportionate influence.

I doubt they can, for 2 simple reasons:

1. Voting in UK elections isn't compulsory. I expect someone who felt really strongly about a conflict in a foreign land is going to be contacting people on the ground there and/or donating money to whichever institution is fighting their cause instead of falling over themselves to vote for a specific UK party, and
2. The UK uses a secret ballot. Just because a mythical ""community leader"" told everyone to vote one way doesn't people are in any way bound to do so.",,/r/europe/comments/ni0dci/uk_how_to_do_foreign_policy_in_a_multiethnic/gz06qrz/,gattomeow,1621643104

&gt;  Z tych os√≥b blisko 2 tys. to te, kt√≥re wypi≈Çy za du≈ºo, nieco ponad tysiƒÖc zmar≈Ço z powodu chor√≥b psychicznych spowodowanych alkoholem; 7 tysiƒôcy umiera na choroby wƒÖtroby.

So only 20% of 10 thousand are people ending up dead because they drank ""too much"", let's assume that mental health deaths are also directly related to the alcohol intake. Still, I seriously doubt that overdose is a main reason behind those 3 thousand deaths.

I can't find any decent Polish stats, WHO reports are weird (why would you provide % of alcohol-relegated epilepsy deaths in relation to total *epilepsy* deaths instead of % of alcohol-relegated epilepsy deaths in relation to total *alcohol-related* deaths in a report called ""Global status report on alcohol and health""?). I'm also too lazy to dive into Polish databases, but the US has a decent statistics in readily accessible HTML, how about [Wisconsin](https://nccd.cdc.gov/DPH_ARDI/default/Report.aspx?T=AAM&amp;P=EEF894CB-3760-4631-8412-9323993109F2&amp;R=EC443A6A-F21E-4B9D-A349-19A16462A0B4&amp;M=934BFE4E-9232-4BF1-AFD0-F42FA617A33B&amp;F=&amp;D=), which I think has the highest percentage of Polish immigrants, to give us at least some vague breakdown?


In those stats, 42% are acute deaths (in comparable to 20+10% in Polish stats, that could be either classification issue in terms of ""psychological diseases"", or just a simple fact that Americans tend to DIU more often because they have no choice). Anyway, the point is, alcohol poisonings are 4% of total acute alcohol deaths and 1.7% of total alcohol-related deaths in America. Basically, you die of liver cirrhosis way before you have a chance to reach the point when you decide to drink so much that you will die directly from overdosing.",,/r/europe/comments/nhtp42/drug_overdose_death_rate_estonia_and_scotland/gz0737w/,boringarsehole,1621643297

&gt;So you hail a veto of helping poor countries and then cry over people from poor countries migrating here?
Not the sharpest idea I've heard.

Why are you trying to twist the narrative? Orban didn't veto the deal because he doesn't want to help 3rd world countries, he vetoed the deal because it's yet another wave of 3rd world immigration into Europe - something only rich business owners wish for as they'll get away with paying less wages. The EU literally just had to take the ""Hey we will also let millions of you come here"" out and we wouldn't have this conversation. Don't blame Orban for vetoing yet another trash deal the EU made, blame the EU for not listening to it's members and making a deal that would make members happy. Orban not wanting mass 3rd world immigration isn't the issue, the EU relentlessly pushing for it is however. It's really not hard to understand.

501,"I don‚Äôt want to argue this with you. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a lovely person and have a nice family life and everything, and I actually mean it when I say I don‚Äôt want to pierce that veil as it were. 

I‚Äôll only say that I actually grew up in the nicer parts of the country (nice suburbs of Edinburgh, the one nice bit in Livingston by the motorway) and I have both been privy to and to some extent experienced terrible conditions. I personally know someone who was raped every other day for two years by a family friend from the ages of 12-14 and nothing was done about it. I know someone for whom both of their parents were alcoholics and they effectively raised themselves and their sister. I know of many people on drugs.

I have travelled to Spain, have numerous Spanish friends, and speak Spanish. I have been in some of the rougher parts of Bilbao and I‚Äôve watched documentaries about what are effectively slums on the edge of Barcelona, and in neither of those places did I perceive anything like the sheer hopelessness that isn‚Äôt just present, but actually characterises much of Scotland. 

I have family in a relatively poor part of Essex and I‚Äôve visited them a few times and it wasn‚Äôt anywhere near as depressing: even though they were pretty far from Chelmsford or London, they still had much more to do, there were more jobs, and if I can go by what my aunt said about the parents at the schools my cousins went to, fewer broken homes. Scotland is exceptional in this regard - I suspect its closest analogues would be places in the former communist bloc, though the choice of drugs and the culture is probably a bit different.

But again, we can agree to disagree. If you have had a good experience here, I‚Äôm genuinely happy for you, and I don‚Äôt want to deprive you of that in any way.

562,"&gt;Selecting only the best vineyards with a great terroir, 

That's true. Choosing a grapevine for the terroir is a pain in the arse because it takes years to produce a reliable harvest to ascertain that you've indeed done fucked up and have chosen the wrong one.
&gt;picking grapes later, having better barrels, longer maturation, less chemicals, all of this takes time and money.

That's not really true, marginal costs are, well, marginal (unless your barrels are golden or something).

The real difference is economics, price discrimination. You charge 20‚Ç¨ not because you've spent 19‚Ç¨. You charge 20‚Ç¨ because you can. Your wine is at least marginally better than lower-level supermarket stuff, so you go with it. In fact, when you started your business 20‚Ç¨ was probably the bottom price in your business plan, because you planned to actually make money.

As for the 5‚Ç¨, you charge that because you can't charge more. You wanted to make 20‚Ç¨+ wine, maybe you even tried to. But either you've fucked up, or some of your land is simply more terror than terroir. Now you're competing with every schmuck from every country you see on this graph, what are the options? Realistically, you don't even bottle your 5‚Ç¨ wine, you wholesale it to people who are fine with a business of buying for 4 and selling for 5 without all that bother.",,/r/europe/comments/nhtl89/world_map_of_wine_exports_2019/gyzsp85/,boringarsehole,1621635581

603,"It may sound counter-intuitive, but Hungary is doing the EU a massive service. The EU in its current form operates under the rules of international diplomacy based in the last 2-3 decades. Everything is slow but due to the idea that a globalist world is meant to benefit everyone, the overarching mindset is that everyone is still attempting to walk in the same, multilateral, direction. 

But the world has taken a different direction. And in a fast pace at that. Big blocks do no longer abide by the old rules of cooperation and verdicts of international organisations. Little by little the century old rule of only might makes right is being applied again. 

The faster the EU realizes that it cant uphold the current status quo to secure, maintain and advance its significance, the more it becomes willing to leverage its core interests even by sacrificing methods it once held sacrileg. Like the power to Veto otherwise agreed upon actions. 

Hungary, in its entirety, is so unimportant, so insignificant, so pathetically weak, that it using its granted powers to hinder the continued development of the EU is exactly what is needed to wake up the EU policy makers to change the rules. Slimming down processes. Streamlining decision making. Reduce bureaucracy. 

In all honesty: Thank you Hungary. Thank you for being just bothering enough for us to cause a change without actually causing any imminent danger.",,/r/europe/comments/nhzzeq/hungary_vetoes_eu_aid_pact_with_poor_countries/gyzcgiy/,No-Confidence-9191,1621627694
604,"&gt; the UKs economy contracted by nearly 10% of GDP in the pandemic compared to nearly 5% in Germany.

The UK has a novel approach towards measuring GDP, in particular government spending. In normal times, the differences are fairly negligible but in a highly abnormal year, like this pandemic, it causes distortionary effects. In particular, the way spending on education and healthcare is factored into GDP means that the UK doesn't capture it if lessons are cancelled or operations/treatments don't happen. To grossly simplify it, the UK measures the actual output (i.e. lessons, doctors appointments), whereas other countries measure it by actual spending (e.g. salaries and other costs). 

If you adjust for this, the UK's *comparable* GDP growth estimate in 2020 improves by around 1.5-2%, putting them in line with France, and doing better than Spain and Italy.

If you measure in purely cash terms, the UK's 2020 GDP growth figure ends up actually looking better than Germany's, but that metric has its own drawbacks.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/nhumki/uk_set_for_fast_and_full_recovery_after_strong/gyzcgoy/,MyFavouriteAxe,1621627696

The UK has one of the most dynamic labour markets in Europe. The latest labour force survey (released this week) showed that total employed was rising and the unemployment rate fell. There are still many people on furlough, but the same thing is true in most other countries (though they have different types of support schemes - such as the German *Kurzarbeit*). 

&gt; Last time I heard people were struggling to find employment (not fucking zero hours).

This has never been the case. UK labour market was tight going into 2020 and zero hours contracts are an incredibly misunderstood thing, and far from the only option. 

&gt; In Germany, there's a shortage of labour in many positions, companies are hiring people with no experience for on the job training atm

But that is not a consistent logic. Biologically, a man is neither a woman nor a pony.

You're subjectively choosing to accept that being a different sex is reasonable and acceptable but the same situation only with the person identifying as a different species is unreasonable. 

Even though the alleged legitimacy that comes from ‚Äúpersonally identifying as‚Äù is the same in both cases.

He identifies as a woman so he's a woman. 

He identifies as a pony so he's a pony.

To be logically consistent, you need to either accept both or neither because they're both different examples of the same argument.

The problem with that argument, and what I'm trying to showcase, is that once you accept that argument of ‚Äúpersonally identifying as‚Äù as being a valid statement that defines a reality then everything goes and there are no possible limits, because the way someone identifies as is as limitless as the human imagination.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/ng679m/spanish_politician_temporarily_suspended_by/gyyycq0/,SprucedUpSpices,1621621126

806,"While there were few conditions the main reason was removing liberum veto 30 years before collapse.

This caused outrage among factions that previously were united with guarantee by that liberum veto that nothing bad will happen to them as they had veto power.

Good example of that was that Sweden was actually in personal union with commonwealth for a good while which is basically never stated and at the time commonwealth wasn't really only borders used on map but it was much wider including few HRE nations as well which also is mostly missing from maps. Russia also wasn't really ""conquered"" because powers there liked commonwealth system of power and they just agreed to oust current power with help of poles though that rather quickly changed.

The point is that commonwealth power was directly tied to its liberum veto because it was guarantee that it was union of minimums in which everyone had to agree to do something before something was done as commonwealth. The moment people started to fuck around around this base (even before removal) the whole thing started to shake and everyone realized that commonwealth become their enemy rather than ally internally.

807,"British consumers flocked to newly reopened stores to buy clothes and other goods in April, pushing retail sales for the month well ahead of the level that economists expected.
  
Retail sales in Great Britain grew 9.2 per cent in April compared with the previous month, data from the Office for National Statistics showed on Friday.
  
That was more than double the 4.5 per cent expansion forecast by economists polled by Reuters, and followed two months of growth even though non-essential stores were shut between early January and April 12.
  
Retail sales ‚Äúare now over 10 per cent above pre-pandemic levels as restrictions eased and more shops were able to open their doors‚Äù, said Jonathan Athow, ONS director of economic statistics.  
  
Clothing sales soared by nearly three-quarters as consumers were able to visit physical stores. Sales in other non-food stores rose 25 per cent over the previous month.  
  

As stores reopened, all parts of the retail sector reported a fall in the proportion of sales coming from online shoppers. Online sales represented 30 per cent of the total in April, down from 35 per cent the previous month.
  
Additional signs of the strength of the sector came on Friday from the research company GfK that showed UK consumer confidence jumping in May and regaining the ground lost during the pandemic.
  
Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that data was consistent with his ‚Äúabove-consensus forecast that gross domestic product will leap by about 5 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter.‚Äù",,/r/europe/comments/nhumki/uk_set_for_fast_and_full_recovery_after_strong/gyyguld/,EmptyRevolver,1621613295

A few hours ago, news arrived that the Moroccan government dispatched buses to local schools in the border area to take kids and young teens to the border. Their parents were not informed, which is how we learnt about it in the first place as you can imagine the chaos it lead to once they found out.

Many of these children (at least the ones that didn't quickly turn back of their own choice or were ecorted back) are currently being temporarily held in detention centers on our side. These aren't 24 year olds pretending to be 17, these are kids likely 14 and under, and the one in the image is not the only baby that came through.

Its important to note that, effectively, Morocco is a dictatorship.

Over the last day, images from Ceuta and Melilla have shown people clawing at the ground and begging to Spanish troops while crying their souls out, mothers being separated from their children, and although its too soon for a tally, at least a few dead are expected and at least one confirmed (last I checked, things are still ongoing)

None of this strikes me as ""young men seeking adventure and women"". There most certainly are quite a few idiots just wanting to cause rrouble among them, especially considering this was a purposeful stunt by Morocco, but if we're gonna call a spade a spade, we should call a racist a racist too.

887,"It's a pretty complicated issue to do with the history of Scotland and the council schemes that were created. The death rate you're seeing now isn't because Scotland takes massively more drugs that anyone else, it's by and large the result of the ""Trainspotting Generation"" from the 80s and 90s reaching the point where their bodies are just failing. They've hit their 50s, and from decades of drug use their bodies can't take it anymore.

That's not to say it's the only reason, after all -why- have they been taking drugs this long? Well this brings us back into the council estates that started being built after the 60s. Scotland had a lot of people living in slum housing in parts of the country, due to the heavy industrial nature of the cities, and the sheer amount of people living there. The government of the time made the decision to tear down these slum houses and relocate people into what was vogue at the time, tower blocks. Now these blocks were massive upgrades living wise for most the poor families who'd been living in slum housing, and it was initially a great boon to them. However the issue is this was also the time where countries had decided the car was king; so these council estates were built with very few amenities, as it was simply assumed that everyone would just drive into the city for shopping, entertainment and work. 

Unfortunately, Thatcher happened. The heavy industries in most of the cities were already in decline, but Thatcher ripped the beating heart out of those still clinging on, and made very, very little effort to replace the jobs lost. Most of the north of the UK was simply placed in what she called ""Managed Decline"".

So now you have a problem, thousands of people who've lost their jobs, living in estates outside the main city, with no amenities, no nearby shops and no money. I should further clarify, in the slum housing extended family groups had often lived together, but in these new council estates, the extended families groups hadn't really been taken into consideration, so often families were far away from previous friends and neighbours they'd known back in the slum housing. So now you have people with no job, no money, no amenities, and no support, trapped in these estates on the outskirts of the city, with essentially no transport. It was just utter poverty and destitution, and these estates declined rapidly. Of course with that sheer poverty, came the drug trade, as for some people it was the only way they could cope with the conditions they were living in. 

These were huge swathes of working class people who'd effectively been utterly abandoned by the Government down south (This was before Scotland got it's own Parliament again) and just left to wallow in extreme poverty. Crime absolutely exploded, and it was for reasons like that, that Glasgow became the murder capital of Europe in the 80s.

I cannot express just the sheer level of poverty there was in so many estates around the country due to the collapse of heavy industry in what had been ""The workshop of the British Empire"" which was further compounded by the isolated position so many people found themselves in due to the urban planning that went on in Glasgow and surrounding regions. 

Things have gotten a lot better now compared to how it was back then, but there's still very large swathes of Glasgow that are extremely poor and deprived, and drug culture has been a thing there for so long it's hard to shake. I think part of the reason it got worse as well is because of things such as the financial crash driving people out of work again, and leaving them trapped in the same sort of situations their parents were in the 80s.

It's a very simplistic overview, but I hope it helps a little to understand as to why drug deaths are so high here.",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/nhtp42/drug_overdose_death_rate_estonia_and_scotland/gyyioqt/,Fairwolf,1621614126

European equities climbed after an economic activity survey offered early evidence that the eurozone was rebounding from a double-dip recession.

The regional Stoxx 600 index, which has hovered around a record high for the past month, added 0.4 per cent by midday in London. The UK‚Äôs FTSE 100 was flat.

IHS Markit‚Äôs purchasing managers‚Äô index, based on manufacturing and service sector executives‚Äô responses to questions on topics such as hiring plans and new business, hit a 39-month high this month with an expansionary reading of 56.9, up from 53.8 in April. A reading of 50 separates growth from contraction.

A US version of this indicator is expected to moderate slightly from the record high it reached in April. Futures markets signalled the S&amp;P 500 index would gain 0.3 per cent at the New York opening bell.

‚ÄúThere is a sequencing in the global recovery, with Europe lagging by a [calendar] quarter or two,‚Äù said Agn√®s Belaisch, chief European strategist at fund manager Barings. ‚ÄúEurope is a very big economic power and it is finally reopening.‚Äù

While the PMI surveys are closely scrutinised for signs of economic recovery, they also offer insight into inflationary pressures that might cause central banks to alter the pace or timelines of their asset purchases. April‚Äôs US survey identified supply-chain shortages that pushed down prices of securities that are sensitive to changing monetary policy expectations, such as government bonds and technology shares.

‚ÄúWhile economic activity is steadily improving, what equity markets will internalise is that there is less cause for support on the monetary policy front as the data improves,‚Äù said Mobeen Tahir, research director at WisdomTree.",,/r/europe/comments/nhth8g/european_stocks_climb_following_strong/gyy1ea9/,quixotic_cynic,1621606356

1124,"&gt; The European Council sets the political agenda, and isn't elected on an EU wide basis (it's the heads of state/government).

&gt;Then you have the Council of the European Union which represents the member states and essentially manages all the international stuff, is effectively a co-equal partner to the Parliament on legislation, sets policy and legislation etc. And of course it isn't elected directly or indirectly either.

But those are elected and/or appointed by a method every member state has chosen and considered sufficient for itself. The EU isn't even allowed to meddle in that process.

&gt;Then you have the Commission, which again, isn't elected, is effectively directed by the member states and is where legislative initiative sits, but absent the usual democratic accountability you'd have in a normal Parliamentary system.
And then you have the EP, which is effectively a relatively recent sop with the intent of giving the EU the appearance of a more democratic approach..

The EP has to approve the Commissioners, and it's not afraid to use that prerogative. The examination before the EP is not a formality and every Commission there are some that have to be replaced. It's also not afraid to use its power do dismiss an entire commission, Santer decided to preventively hand in his resignation. The EP is not a paper tiger.

I do of course agree it would be better that it had legislative initiative.

&gt;Sure, but generally you have parties standing on a consistent policy base, not a whole slew of national parties that adopt a banner to campaign under that is separate again.

I don't understand what you mean. The EP fractions represent the political ideologies which are present in most EU countries (liberalism, christian democracy, socialism, greens, conservatives, etc.).

We have the Karneval of course, one of the biggest in northern Europe, and several big cultural landmarks like Nordkraft, the House of Music and many art museums. Of course, if you like a good night out, Jomfrue Ane Street is the biggest and most densely packed party street in the north!

1184,"&gt;But those are elected and/or appointed by a method every member state has chosen and considered sufficient for itself. The EU isn't even allowed to meddle in that process.

Which is a contributing factor to the argument that the power sits with the member states. The EU's structure perpetuates that..

&gt;The EP has to approve the Commissioners, and it's not afraid to use that prerogative. The examination before the EP is not a formality and every Commission there are some that have to be replaced. It's also not afraid to use its power do dismiss an entire commission, Santer decided to preventively hand in his resignation. The EP is not a paper tiger.

That's literally the only power that the EP has over the commission, and if powers of the EP and commission were more balanced you could argue that it's similar to the formation of a government under a parliamentary system. But they aren't, the EP has very limited powers and the politicking around the commission doesn't really scratch the surface. The EP is not quite a paper tiger, but it's damn close to being one. 

&gt;I do of course agree it would be better that it had legislative initiative.

It'd be useful if it had legislative initiative, was more transparent and was able to push legislation (within the competencies of the EU) with review from the other institutions. That's broadly how parliamentary systems work (possibly with a requirement for a threshold to override), but it has none of those features. It can essentially approve or not, things that the states have pushed (And in some cases it doesn't even have a role there beyond a symbolic one). 

&gt;I don't understand what you mean. The EP fractions represent the political ideologies which are present in most EU countries (liberalism, christian democracy, socialism, greens, conservatives, etc.). It frays a bit at the radical edges but that's normal, in a parliament as large as the EP there is room for political experimentation, and ideological radicals always have trouble finding a stable compromise even among each other. Most EP fractions do have a consistent policy.

I mean that if you look at the actual elections, no-one is electing people based on them being in the EPP or S&amp;D etc.. but rather voting for national parties. It's essentially a bit of a facade. The EP alliances and the national party positions are fairly regularly somewhat divergent and voters end up voting on the basis of one thing while they get something very different in terms of representation.",Ulster,/r/europe/comments/ngu5ut/polish_schools_will_teach_that_eu_is_unlawful/gyxfnjj/,marsman,1621593045

1189,"I don't see the issue of an animal/environmental scientist being funded by a national department of agriculture. 

If you dig into many research papers and it's authors you'll find nefarious funding sources, including ones critical of animal agriculture.

First, regarding the research of Mitloehner F., the research funding he received from industry sources are less than 5% of his total. Most of the research is funded by the University (UC Davis) which employs him, is peer-reviewed and published in well-respected scientific journals. Second, his funding sources and potential biases are clearly stated in his published research, which is more than can be said about most other researchers. Third, he's a researcher of air quality specialist specifically involved in animal science, so animals and their effect on air quality is exactly what he studies. Fourth, if a scientist believes that a international institution is devising policy on false premises, they will and should attempt to make them reevaluate their findings.

Finally and most importantly, the presence of industry funding does not invalidate findings, only the analysis of the methodology, it's results and conclusion can do so. The presence of funding may explain some of the authors own interpretation of the results, but other researchers reading it will understand if the conclusion doesn't add up with the findings and if those findings are found via methodological errors. If every research paper whose authors had questionable funding sources was rejected outright, simply because of the funding sources, there would be a significant number of ""studies"" that news like to ""cite"" that would never see the light of day.",,/r/europe/comments/nh888y/germany_to_ban_chick_shredding_from_2022_in/gyxfq5x/,irykiryk,1621593108

https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Palestine_(2003)

This is the state you claim is not an ethno state:

Article 1 (the highest, most important)

Palestine is part of the large Arab World, and the Palestinian people are part of the Arab Nation. Arab Unity is an objective which the Palestinian People shall work to achieve. 

(hmm, isn't that weird to have that as the first article in an independent country?)

Second article

The Palestinian People are the source of all power, which shall be exercised through the legislative, executive, and judicial authorities, based on the principle of separation of powers, and in the manner set forth in this Basic Law. 

(so in order to be part of the Palestinian people, you need to first and foremost work for ARAB UNITY, get it?).

Article 3
Jerusalem is the Capital of Palestine. 

(really, why do you think this is placed at number 3 and not number 100?)

ARTICLE 4

Islam is the official religion in Palestine. Respect and sanctity of all other heavenly religions shall be maintained. The principles of Islamic Shari‚Äôa shall be the main source of legislation. Arabic shall be the official language.

How pluralistic of you to condemn Israel for being an ethno state.

&gt; Source?

Palestinian Authority (check wikipedia).

&gt; Hmmm I wonder why that is? Surely not because of the bombings and population resettlement that Israel has been doing, right? But of course it can only be the fault of other Palestinians and not the foreign force that has been kicking them out of their homes for decades.

No, it is because they are getting murdered by Muslims, just like everywhere else in the Middle East. It is happening all over the place, but of course you can always blame Israel for Christians getting killed in Syria right?

&gt; Second of all, to answer your inquire: See the law above that says that no one besides Jews have the right for self-determination in Israel and that Israel is a state for the Jewish people.

That is not an answer. Arabs STILL have more rights in Israel than anywhere else in the Middle East AND you called me a liar for it and you STILL have not provided a single fucking shitty example. Because you can't find it and you know it. The obvious truth just stares you in the eye and you try so hard to look the other way.

&gt; Now this is not only straight up racism, but also plain xenophobic and islamophobic propaganda. You say this far-right shit and want to put things on me and put words in my mouth?

No, it is the truth. Child molestation and wife killings are legal in Palestine. Just as killing of homosexuals. That is your fucking dream state that you are supporting. Is that the reason you support Palestine?

&gt; You are just a racist, you don't really care about this conflict and its peaceful resolution.

No I am not. Racism is the belief in genetic superiority or genetic inferiority. Islam is not a race, it is an idea.

&gt; What is this level of coping and lying? Israel has totally claimed and gained total control of area C.

But it IS neither Israel nor Palestine at this moment. That is the problem. If Israel annexed Palestine and treated its citizens that way then YES, Israel would be an apartheid state. But it has not annexed Area C and Palestine has not defined its territorial claims others than saying Area C belongs to them which is not good enough in the context.

&gt;  The other reason why are you lying is that all of the apartheid state measures do not somehow magically disappear when you enter Israel, they are active and valid in there too.....as once again, seen in the links I have given above.

What? Do you also think Israelis have full citizenship rights in Palestine? You do understand that non citizens does not get full citizenship rights in Europe either?",,/r/europe/comments/nff9yc/eu_criticises_israeli_bombing_of_gaza_strip_media/gywyths/,Mtat78,1621577781

And how Russians became the ethnic majority is immaterial. At the same time when the Russians became the clear majority in Crimea because of Soviet removal of other populations, the Ukrainians became the majority in Lwow because the Soviets removed the Polish majority of a city they had illegally seized from Poland in an alliance with Nazi Germany and then later never gave back.

So I'd be entirely in favor of your logic, that borders should be returned to their pre-Soviet lines. But then Ukraine needs to give back Lwow and other areas they got through the Soviet alliance with Nazi Germany.

https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/sciencecommunication/2017/10/02/different-cultures-see-different-colours/

Neither of those examples shows that the perception of color, its [qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia), is in any way different. It's entirely possible that the perception is the same, and they're just interpreted differently. 

&gt;You talk to people. That's how you figure out what other people think.

This only works if what they think can be expressed in language. Private language is impossible, so you can't figure out their purely internal states. Ever heard of the beetle-in-a-box?

&gt;People actually say ""I feel like a man"".

Why does one specific person say ""I feel like a *man*"" rather than ""I feel like a *woman*"" rather than ""I feel like ...""? How do they associate the word ""man"" or ""woman"" or whatever to their feeling?

The fact that you have heard ""social sciences"" is a case in point because social sciences are not science. But most importantly, racism is probably the term  that they have inflated the most. Going from a narrow definition of ""genetic superiority or inferiority"" it is now usually ""disrespect of other cultures"". You state you have never been called a racist for objecting to a foreign cultural practice, I must say either it is a question of time or you are somehow protected from criticism because of your specific ethnicity. In Sweden for example you cannot object to female genital mutilation in some academic circles today unless you are a woman or a man of a non-Caucasian origin.

I think I should inform people because the Turkish state is dangerous and deserves immense criticism. Not the people, but also not just the current government, the state. A lot of people don't know that. You have an unrealistic view of people's attitudes towards Turkey. Germany usually supports the Turkish state, often against other EU members, for example.

If Hitler and Germany didn't lose the war, and hadn't reformed, and common politicians in Germany later praised him, it would be a problem. Ekrem may be the best the Turkish political system has to offer, out of the people that have a significant chance to win, but people should know about his massive flaws.

Yes and if he gets votes and he beats Erdogan good for you, but he shouldn't be praised by Europeans as some sort of saviour who rises above Turkey's problems.

1781,"I think there's a difference in common terminology between British English, American English and International English.

In British English, ""state"" means a state like the UK, Republic of Ireland or USA, unless it's specifically in reference to a subdivision that is known as a state, e.g. in Germany. Province or Region would be the more proper British word for that. ""Country"" is effectively equivalent to nation, but more speaking about the political entity rather than the people (but can also mean region, e.g. the West Country). Country can have different meanings in the UK depending on context. The country in question could be Scotland or England or it could equally be the whole UK. For example, National Rail provides rail services across Great Britain, but it's still called National rail. Meanwhile the National Health Service is specific to each constituent country.

The EP is, the judiciary isn't elected anywhere in the EU, the Commission is approved by the directly elected parliament (like in most member states). The only indirect elements are those where they member states get their say, like the 2 Council members, but those people are appointed in the member state, so if they want to have a direct election for those they can. They decide how they appoint them. They just represent their national government's position anyway, so it matters littel.

&gt;even elections aren't EU wide

1977,"&gt;western powers in Eu or USA propably wouldn't let Azerbaijan go that far.

Well, realistically, what could they do? They would have nothing to gain by helping Armenia. Azerbaijan is rich in oil and crucial in containing Russia.

Armenia, which has had its hand forced to be a staunch Russian ally, and is much poorer than Azerbaijan with no real economical benefits has nothing for the US or France to really gain by helping them. They'd condemn it, sure, maybe even place sanctions on Azerbaijan afterwards, but they would not invade.

Also, realistically Turkey is gonna support Azerbaijan in this unfortunately. Turkey supports Azerbaijan in pretty much everything they do. Turkey is a NATO member, and right next to Armenia, so staging any counter offensives there would be impossible.

&gt;But are they in a better position as Russian paw?

They're not lmao, being Russia's ""friend"" is arguably worse than being their enemy. But Armenia are stuck between a rock and a hard place, they essentially *have* to be friendly with Russia, whether they like it or not.

&gt;I think Russia prefers both weak or at least Armenia weak

Yeah, but thing is, I don't think Russia's gonna be a major power in the near future. Their economy is terrible and they're completely reliant on fossil fuels, combined with an aging population, that's a great fornula for a declining country. Once Putin finally croaks, Russia's gonna go back to the 90's era of instability and economic collapse.

Russia falling apart or suffering from internal problems would be a perfect opportunity for Azerbaijan to finish Armenia off.

Also, yeah, Azerbaijan doesn't formally have claims on Armenia proper. But they certainly seem to have them de facto. Azerbaijan's government is so deranged, they quite literally believe all of Armenian history is fake, all the way back to Roman times, and that it's all rightful Azerbaijani land that's been stolen by the fake Armenians.

When you have a mentality like that....I mean it's pretty easy to justify invading the rest of Armenia.

I'll be honest, the current events are so bizarre, unexpected, and counter to everything I know about realpolitik, national interest, international brinkmanship, etc., that it does take video evidence to make me believe any of this is actually happening in the first place, and even then I struggle with what my eyes are showing me. 

It would have been *easy* for the Moroccan State to just have the border guards turn their backs on the interior altogether and focus entirely on stopping people from coming *in*. All it would have required is them to NOT do something. It would have been *easy* for authorities and spokespeople to spin this in a ""we've suddenly developed a conscience and will no longer do your dirty work"". 

Instead, actively opening the gates? Encouraging people? Bussing them from the region? *Bussing them from **thousands of miles South**, all the way from **Western Sahara?*** I hope you'll find it understandable that all of this is difficult to believe, as it's all in violation of common sense, self-interest, public relations, reliability as an international partner... It's the worst-looking, most expensive, most idiotic way they could've done this, short of filling [C-17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-17_Globemaster_III) airplanes with people they'd gather from the most remote and unreachable valleys of the Atlas and parachuting them en masse at the edge of EU airspace. I find this course of action frankly *incomprehensible*, both as a whole and in the details. 

I haven't heard of the Germany thing, and I'm afraid to ask what *that* could be.

&gt; Who could blame Mohammed VI for having those long-term dreams? His father's ""Spanish brother"", Juan Carlos I was after all actually keen on gifting Melilla for free already in 1979 and turning Ceuta into a Tangier-like international zone.

Again with the extraordinary claims. I know the Spanish Royal Family have been embrassing themselves for quite a while, now, but in the ""seeking personal profit and enjoying illicit pleasures *while* serving Spanish interests, maybe engaging in some behind-the-scenes rivalry with the occasional assassination and such,"" [which is not that shocking a way for Royalty to behave](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/feb/08/royals-vetted-more-than-1000-laws-via-queens-consent) - it's practically expected. But this, this sounds like *attempted **treason***. It's the sort of thing guillotines are set up for. Why would they ever *consider* doing such a thing?

&gt;Morocco is not going to move in the Canary Islands but a favourable delimitation between the EEZ of the Canary Islands with that of occupied WS is of the utmost importance for the Makhzen as a mid-term project (three-decade project) when undersea mining becomes a thing.

I had never considered that. Still, those long-term ambitions are all the more reason to act cautiously, patiently, and to cultivate a respectable PR. This recent little exhibition would, in this perspective, be a bit like attempting a sprint 30km into a Marathon . I can't imagine how it would make sense to do so.

&gt;The military gap is closing in

With what resources? Spain has a solid military, which is likely to soon be in turn part of an increasingly united European military, which would be a whole other beast. I can't possibly see the isolated, low-productivity, perpetually brain-drained, tension-ridden, hyper-unequal, Moroccan economy, riddled with fraud and corruption and arbitrariness and judicial insecurity, competing with them.

2068,"&gt;Yeah and it is only 70 families being evicted.

  
Ah, so now after your cherry picking after the whataboutism, you go to moving goal posts. So now it went from the land being owned by Jews, to some families that got evicted. While still bad, it is nowhere near the thing you were trying to portray, but you keep deflecting from the real topic and trying so desperately to find something to hold on. Especially considering that this neighbourhood got occupied and claimed by Israel that is trying to displace more and more Palestinians from there.

&gt;Palestine is an ethno state for Palestinians, as it is written in their constitution.

&amp;#x200B;

Which constitution? This? [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian\_law#Basic\_Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_law#Basic_Law)

Because there is nothing in it that says or even implies what you said.

Not to mention that your whole logic of comparing Israel and Palestine like that is false, as Palestine is not some officially recognized one state. It is occupied by Israel with even more territorial claims. You are acting like the two state solution has been up and running.

&gt;In Israel you have full citizenship rights as an Arab

False according to a BASIC Law in Israel: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic\_Law:\_Israel\_as\_the\_Nation-State\_of\_the\_Jewish\_People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law:_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;you do not have that as a Jew in Palestine.

Source?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No, they were. There are less than 100 Christians in Gaza and 0 Jews. 0. Nada. Zip. The percentage of Christians in The West Bank is also rapidly dwindling.

Hmmm I wonder why that is? Surely not because of the bombings and population resettlement that Israel has been doing, right? But of course it can only be the fault of other Palestinians and not the foreign force that has been kicking them out of their homes for decades.

Name me one fucking country in the middle east where Arabs have more rights than in Israel.

&gt;First of all, this is not how you do it. When you claim something, the burden of proof is on you. Prove that Arabs have less rights in other MENA countries than in Israel? 

Second of all, to answer your inquire: See the law above that says that no one besides Jews have the right for self-determination in Israel and that Israel is a state for the Jewish people.

&gt;They even have more RELIGIOUS rights in Israel than in most Muslim countries, **except for child molestation and wife killing which of course is totally OK in your favourite pedofile country Palestine**.

Now this is not only straight up racism, but also plain xenophobic and islamophobic propaganda. You say this far-right shit and want to put things on me and put words in my mouth?

Come on, you should have long just came out and said that you do not recognize Palestine and its right to exist, you do not recognize the Palestinian people and their right for self-determination and existence and that you think that all of them are some vile murderous pedophile primitive barbaric filthy muslims. Because this is what you are giving out with that statement of yours. You are just a racist, you don't really care about this conflict and its peaceful resolution.

&gt;But that is not in Israel, that is in Area C. Big difference.  Area C is neither Palestine NOR Israel as of yet.

What is this level of coping and lying? Israel has totally claimed and gained total control of area C. All of those measures are DONE and ENFORCED by Israel, the occupying power. Israel does not let Palestinians even do anything in it, build, construct, do business, etc. They need permits for that, and who gives permits? Israel. Who is the authority that enfroces control of the permits? Israel.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West\_Bank\_Areas\_in\_the\_Oslo\_II\_Accord#Use\_of\_Area\_C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank_Areas_in_the_Oslo_II_Accord#Use_of_Area_C)

The other reason why are you lying is that all of the apartheid state measures do not somehow magically disappear when you enter Israel, they are active and valid in there too.....as once again, seen in the links I have given above.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Palestinians. There are riots everytime Jews get near the Temple Mount.  
  
Nope. There are plenty of Jews who wants to go there but are not allowed to.

2222,"&gt;Nationalism and democracy have strong ties.

Yeah because as we all know, the successor countries to Austria-Hungary were all heralds of democracy up to this day.

If you're not familiar with the story:

\- Austria became ""the german republic of Austria"" with the goal to join the larger german empire, but the allies refused it. The Austrian people voted to join Germany. 

\- Hungary stayed a democray for about two years before becoming an autocracy again, under the pressure of nationalists (Horthy).

\- Ceskoslovakia was probably one of the most successful democracies to succeed to Austria-Hungary, and ironically it was also one of the most ethnically diverse states with only 50% of Ceks. Basically, what Austria-Hungary could have become. Some writers said that the second heart of Austria was in Praag.

\- The other successful democracy was Poland, which lasted til the WW2. And again, a rather diverse state, with 70% of Poles.

\- The slovene/croat/serb democracy survived 1 year before becoming a kingdom

\- The kingdom of Serbia was, well, a kingdom

\- The Ukrainian part was very unstable

\- some parts joined the *kingdoms* of Italy and Romania.

IMO, it wouldn't surprise me if there is a current political shift happening. The world has largely been a politically conservative one since the 1970's. 50 years on, modern conservatism increasingly fails to provide the answers to the problems nations face, and a political reevaluation to more social-democratic societies comes as a result. This is happening in Europe, as well as America, just with different starting points and dates. 

The same could be said about the conservative shift that happened in the 1970's, when ideals shifted from more government to less government worldwide. The US (arguably) started from a more conservative position, but the phenomenon was not unique to the US, as it even applied to Europe, China, the Soviet Union (with Brezhnev) and a lot of other places in the world. I think it would be inaccurate to say that this shift in political thinking is the world becoming ""more American"", and similarly the shift to more social-democratic governance is not ""more European"".",The Netherlands| EU federalist,/r/europe/comments/ngy636/why_the_us_is_becoming_more_european/gytatbx/,Wazzupdj,1621512862

Fair point. A case can be made that the NATO Double-Track Decision was a significant escalation however, and it had no impact on gas deliveries. 

&gt; first deliveries in insignificant amounts started in 1973

Depends on whether you count Austria as ""western europe"", deliveries to Austria started in 1969. 

Also depends on what you call ""significant"". The initial contract was 3 bn m¬≥ per year. Limited not by the pipeline but by the contract. 

&gt; but they really started after complention of Urengoy‚ÄìPomary‚ÄìUzhhorod pipeline in 1984, which allowed large quantites of natural gas to be transmitted to WE.

Funny you say that , because you seem to hop on every opportunity to shit on Russia, and that is unbearable. The only trully ""power hungry"" nation in the world is the US, and that is the cold hard objective unnegotiable truth.

I am serbian , most serbians love Russia, Russia entered WW1 on our side after our government pleaded to the Tsar, to prevent our country's utter destruction and the massacre of our people. The russian people shead their blood for us (and their own interests of course) many times over, and that is a debt that cannot be repaid. We as serbs find solidarity with Russia and russians because our people have also been demonized by the west in the past. And we know far too well of how the west does politics , they are NOT your friends and you are NOT treated equally, we were the allies of Americans in both world wars and saved their soldiers on many occassions, yet they come and bomb our capital a couple decades later with depleted uranium in complete defiance of the UN.

They may turn into racists though if they are flooded with replies from Turks telling them that they deserved it.

Acting like that only turns more people against Turks in general.

If instead of that the Turks on Reddit recognised the artocities Turkey has committed in the past and is doing now, and the huge problem in Turkish politics as a whole, which are filled with denialism and colonialist mentalities, and just openly said they are against it and are trying to improve the situation, you would have much less people turning to racism against them, and the unyielding racists would be quickly downvoted by the rest of the sub.",,/r/europe/comments/ngdk2x/ankara_and_istanbul_mayors_on_twitch_to_reach_out/gyt0bb8/,antdim,1621505730

Nobody is changing the definition of homosexual, you can keep being attracted to men and respected for that. You can also have personal genital preferences and say you're not comfortable having a relationship with someone who doesn't have a penis. Just don't use that as a way to publicly shame and hurt trans men.

And yes I know there are multiple radicals who will try to shame you for genital preferences, but as long as you do that in a human manner don't bully them and try to deny them their right to their innate and unchangeable gender identity rest assured that 95% of real trans people (not just the twitter community) will respect you.

The source for the case data and positive testing data is here: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

The source for the vaccine data is here: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations

I've had requests for the spreadsheet, so here is the original as of 17th November: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HUFdsIJEXFPcawCd7KC1atBzuzf59bGkeJTJqnURTTk/edit?usp=sharing

I won't be keeping these versions up to date but you can see how the data is entered and calculated. 

**Version Notes**

The ecdc stopped updating data on a daily basis as of 14th December. I figured weekly data wasn't particularly useful and while the worldometer data is not as accurate as an official agency, at least it is daily so people can make informed decisions about it. 

Just so you can see the extend of the variances, here is the data for the 12th, 13th and 14th of December between worldometer and ecdc: https://imgur.com/Y71Nx7o

Some of this will be due to delays in data reporting and methodologies, others will be the source. In order to do a more detailed comparison, you need to look at the data sources on the ecdc and worldometer sites.

The good news is that worldometer data allows me to look wider than just the UK and EU and also has up-to-date testing data, which allows for the positivity data to be more useful and match the case data in terms of time frame. 

I've added vaccination data as of 23 March 2021. This data is sourced separately and is also not always fully up to date - as such, there's a column which includes the data date. Note that I will be reporting as per the data collected by ""Our World in Data"". 

**Schedule**

I will post this chart daily (where possible) during the week, Monday to Friday but I will not update it at weekends because around half of the countries do not update their numbers over the weekend and also it's on a computer I would not otherwise be logging onto, unless there's something particularly notable which requires a weekend update.

**Explaining some numbers**

*What is the 7 day case rate?* 

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it.

The 7 day case rate number in the graph is the number of people in that stadium who would have a coronavirus infection a week later. For example, in the UK on the 8th November the number was 239.7. That means 240 out of 100,000 people in the stadium would have an infection the following week.

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the daily movement*

The daily movement numbers are just how the 7 day case rate is moving up and down each day. The 7 day trend is the most interesting number - it's the sum of all the ups and downs. If you think of the infection as a car then the 7 day case rate is the speed of the coronavirus infection and the 7 day trend is the acceleration (or deceleration) of the infection. If the 7 day trend is red it's accelerating, if it's neither red nor green it's holding steady and if it's green it means it's slowing down (note - a green 7 day rate doesn't mean the infection is shrinking, just that it's slowing down).

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*How can I tell if the infection is shrinking*

You can't infer that from this data, this data only looks and new cases and the rate of change in new cases. The other side of the equation is how many people are recovering from coronavirus in each country. If you think of it like a bath - this is how much water is flowing through the taps. You cannot tell how much water is going down the plughole so you can't tell how much water is in the bath (i.e. the infection level).

*What is testing rate per 100,000?*

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it.

The testing rate is how many of those 100,000 people will have received a coronavirus test in a 7 day period. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the positive test rate*

This is the % of tests taken which are coming back positive. The WHO says countries should aim for this to be 3% or lower and that testing not keeping up with infections if the rate is above 10%. If you don't have enough tests, you restrict access to them to people who are more likely to be infected either by their symptoms or their risk of exposure, and that inflates your numbers.

This number is a ratio of tests completed, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 3% adjusted case rate*

Used to be the 10% rate but has been rebased around 3%. There is also a lower limit at 1% where the impact will be reduced by a factor of 5. 

Countries with a higher positivity rate are not testing enough of their population, so this multiplies their most recent day's case rate by a factor of their positivity rate divided by 3% - for example on 6th April Greece's positivity rate was 6% so their daily case rate was multiplied by 6%/3% = 2

**This is not** an estimate of the true scale of the pandemic within the country** but is a proxy to rank countries by accounting for countries who are showing a lower positive case rate because they're not doing enough testing.

This number accounts for population size AND level of testing within a country, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 7 Day Vaccines per 100,000?*

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it. This is the number of people in the stadium who would have received a vaccine dose of that stadium in a 7 day period. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 1st Dose %*

This is the % of a population who have received their first vaccine dose. It covers total population which includes children so will be lower than the number some sources cite (% of adult population)

*What is the 2nd Dose %*

This is the % of a population who have received all of their vaccine doses to be considered vaccinated (includes single dose vaccines like J&amp;J)

**What are the marks out of 10**

A formula gives every country a score between 1 and 11 for how bad their 10% adjusted case rate is and multiples it by the 1st dose %. The higher the better. 

For the graph on 22nd March, Estonia, at the top of the chart, gets a score of 1; Iceland, at the bottom of the chart, gets a score of 11. Everybody else gets a score somewhere in between. It then multiplies this by 2/3 of the total doses of vaccines given. Since no country has a vaccine rate greater than 90% it is effectively a score between 1 and 10.

What does it mean? It's a score as to how well the country is managing the pandemic - when the score gets close to 10 this means they have very low infection rates and very high vaccination rates. 

This number accounts for population size AND level of testing AND vaccine rates within a country, so you can compare country-by country

**Why sort by the 10% Adjusted Rate?**

Look at Poland on 9th November as an example - their actual 7 day rate was not actually much higher than the UK's (200 vs 160) and is lower than Denmark's (221), but their positive test rate is 49% - basically 1 out of 2 tests came back positive compared to 5% for UK and 2% for Denmark. Poland only test a fraction of their population compared to the UK or Denmark (706  vs 3198 / 8658 per 100,000) so their actual rate of infection is going to be much higher - their 7 day rate is just kept artificially low by the amount of tests they're (not) doing.

The 10% Adjusted Rate accounts for this. 

This method is **not perfect** as countries account for positivity differently. For instance, some countries (e.g. UK, Italy) include lateral flow tests in overall testing rates and positivity whereas other countries (e.g. Germany) only include PCR so their rates will appear higher and testing rates will appear lower. In addition, countries may alter the way they account for things. While it's important to use this metric to help smooth out countries not doing enough testing, remember that it's not perfect and doesn't tell the full story. 

There is no one unbiased source and you should seek to get your information from a range of sources and assess the underlying bias in the information you're reading and the possible agenda that source may have.

**Why is X country not on the list? / Why is this EU-centric / There are non-EU countries above the total**

I originally did refer to this as EU rather than Europe and I had a lot of comments from people about their country being in the data but them not being in the EU. So I removed any reference to the EU. Since then I've had increasing numbers of comments about why this is EU-centric. To be clear - countries above the grey line aren‚Äôt just EU, the reason they‚Äôre above the line is because they were the countries tracked by the ecdc which was the original source of the data.

Since December I‚Äôve had to switch to using worldometer as the ecdc only provide weekly data. As such I added a small basket of additional countries but I added these below the line, because I wanted the data to be comparable for people looking pre- and post- ecdc data. The countries in the basket were those most commonly requested. The only limitation I have is that I need to be able to fit the screenshot on one page. The total number of lines available is 41, so I don‚Äôt have enough lines for all 48-51 European countries (depending on where you draw the line on Europe and which states you recognize). 

Regardless of how I cut this, it seems it‚Äôs going to annoy somebody. But if you have a country that you feel should be represented that isn't and there's enough demand for it, I'm happy to see what I can accommodate.","British, spiritual EU citizen in exile due to Brexit üôÅ",/r/europe/comments/nguipu/7_day_case_rate_positivity_rate_and_vaccination/gyst13c/,sonicandfffan,1621498849

It is the solution to a problem that does exist. 

And the problem is: To offer asylum (and subsidiary protection) you have to be able to protect them, in extreme cases this means to fight somebody else for them.

With people commonly classified as weaker (women, children, elderly, disabled, etc.) nobody expects them to fight for themselves, the ""strong"" protect them.

Now this refugee crisis was special in that the ""strong"" were actually those that requested the protection, as it was mostly healthy males that traveled to the EU.

2790,"He was wrong to say it would be lower by definition, but this measure has features that will give a higher average in any realistic situation. One note is that people can't have a negative wage since that before expenses and debt. There's a fixed minimum wage of 0 with no maximum wage causing a long tail on the rich side, which increases the averages while barely moving the median.

More importantly, having more money gives you an advantage for further increasing their wealth--the Mathew Effect. Investing a given amount of money or sacrificing your current income to pursue another opportunity becomes less risky as your wealth increases. Without external forces, people with higher incomes will increase their income faster. People with the most money also have the most potent ability to alter those external forces to their advantage, meaning that systems which prevent the Mathew Effect tend to have a more negligible effect over time from incremental interference from the wealthiest individuals.

Besides that, a lower average describes a case where the upper class is larger than the lower class. The majority of work that society needs to support wealthy individuals requires a more significant number of people earning less to maintain that upper class. If there are too few people working for the upper class, it becomes unstable. That will collapse unless unlucky or less wealthy people start filling those roles since the weather can afford to pay them to do it, which rebalances the system to have a lower median.",,/r/europe/comments/nfzzeb/average_net_wage_in_europe_2013_vs_2021/gys20dx/,labouts,1621479960

Gender theory linguistically doesn't make sense in languages that conflates sex and gender into one word. Because then you have to say X is different from X, using the same word for the 2 concepts.

Hard cop out. Your claim was that somehow migrants to Europe were different.

My answer is that they are not.

&gt;And for the studies just fucking google : [european country name] muslims study. It's really not that hard.

Since I just denied the existence of those studies, I am not going to waste my own time finding which doesn't exist.

**There are** studies on how different groups integrate, both within Europe and elsewhere. Every single one I have read puts the spotlight solely on the governments that do not do enough to encourage integration, but that's mostly because Europe's idea of integration is not compatible with migrant nations.

The entire argument that 'some people can't integrate' has been debunked literally every time it is brought up in Canada and the USA, and we have a lot more experience with migrants, and studying their effects on society, than Europe does.

Here it states that in 2017 the danish state had a netto loss of 33 billion crowns. Granted that is in 2017 it is still a ton of money on what according to the wiki is only 5-6 procent of the population at the time.  


Today is a different story. I made this diagram from Danmarks Statistik website from ''1st kvartal 2021'' i.e this year: [https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/Graphics/MakeGraph.asp?interactive=true&amp;menu=y&amp;maintable=FOLK1C&amp;pxfile=20215200831327011570FOLK1C.px&amp;gr\_type=5&amp;PLanguage=0](https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/Graphics/MakeGraph.asp?interactive=true&amp;menu=y&amp;maintable=FOLK1C&amp;pxfile=20215200831327011570FOLK1C.px&amp;gr_type=5&amp;PLanguage=0) It states that the current non-danish population is around 13-15% and I do believe most of them to be muslim. Now the worrying thing for many danes is that lets say 5% of the population is muslim, that means that 5% of the population is making a grand ton of problems. We are talking gangs, extremism, crime etc. There are indeed many other problems the politicans could and should focus on, but as I said before it is a pretty big deal that 5% of the population is causing so many problem here, not to mention that those people were not even welcome here to begin with.  


And to your statement about that you will forever be a ''perker'' or ''foreigner'' is 100% right, a lot of danes have it this way. Mainly because many danes believe that to be danish is something you are, not something you become. I've heard some say the phrase ''At v√¶re dansk er en ***v√¶ren***'' which means to be danish.

I recognise that if implemented in a certain way, for example to have non-gendered toilets, it can make people uncomfortable. I‚Äôve had enough of numskulls pissing on toilet seats or not cleaning the toilet behind them (very common in male toilets). Female bathrooms are often very different, and there is a different etiquette. This is where some fear arises, that women‚Äôs rights and liberties will be curtailed in pursuance of equality. Why should one sex be forced to put up with the lack of respect from another? This could quite simply be combatted by fostering a culture of fucking etiquette and hygiene. It depends how we implement a system which supports everyone.

The bathroom issue is talked to death and people simply don‚Äôt understand it. This isn‚Äôt an exhaustive explanation, and I‚Äôm no expert. I‚Äôm simply fed up of people saying that, if we let trans people use the bathroom in-line with their gender, that that will condone creeps. Any fucker can stick a wig on and creep in a bathroom.

3033,"&gt;super easy to build

That's a really positive assessment. Mountainous infrastructure is notoriously hard and expensive to build and maintain. 

&gt;But now it is üôÇ

Well yes but we are talking about a historical perspective here. All countries on the Danube couldn't benefit from that canal before '92 and neither could the rest of Romania benefit from modern infrastructure to link up  with newly acquired Transylvania in the interwar period. The differences in economic development on both sides of the Carpathians are noticeable to this day.

&gt;Why would this matter in times of peace?

Well in a case of war having a big river as a border is a big plus because the enemy has to cross it to get to you. But controlling both banks of a big river comes with some benefits. Like double the amount of good farmland, non-tariff trade with the region on the other side (used to matter a lot before the EU). 

&gt;Direct access to Russia, still a pretty big economy plus a transit country for Asian trade, direct access to Turkey (similar), rather short connection to the Suez Canal.

The new Silk road is a bit short of being completed so using Russia as a ""transit country"" for Asian trade is a massive pain in the ass. The situation is even worse if you try to transit through Turkey. 

Still, at least the Suez is near and the Bosphorus and Dardanelles are pretty wide.

3224,"Leaving out? I am not leaving out anything, I am talking about the Palestinian-Israel conflict that this thread and post are about. You are what abouting things outside the region and people of the region and blaming me in leaving things out, lmao. What has happened in other countries is irrelevant to this discussion and not the fault of Palestinians. Whataboutism at its finest. But of course you are mentioning that because to you all Arabs and Arab nations are the same right?  Just being casually racist again. Palestinians, Egyptians, Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqi, Saudis, Yemenis and etc., they are all the same eh? Whatever happens in one of those places is automatically assigned to rest? 

Not to mentioned that this article is so opinioned that it isn't even funny:

&gt;And when Israel declared independence **following the** **UN partition plan**, many of the Palestinian Arabs who left were not pushed out, but departed on the orders of their own leadership so as to stay out of the way when several Arab armies marched in with the aim of wiping out the Jews.

The UN partition plan was a proposal, a recommendation by the the UN. The UN did not declare or demand that this plan has to be executed or that Palestinians must accept it. Israel took that planed and enforced it on its own without any consideration of the Palestinian people. 

Furthermore, this article includes not only the problem I outlined above of treating all Arab nations and their individual internal politics as one thing, but it takes it one place further and going through different years back, which has even more so NOTHING to do with the **Palestiniain-Israel conflict**. So it is assigning past crimes of totally unrelated people and times to a future conflict, which makes totally no sense at all.

The article would have been perfect if it was a history of oppression, discrimination, pogroms and other atrocities towards the Jewish people throughout history, but using that as some kind of card against the Palestinians and pro-Palestinian side of the conflict is completely absurd.

But to get back on topic, while still somewhat related to the article above, about the war in 1948 and its consequences about the exodus of people, here is a pretty good description of how many Jews immigrating into Palestine/Israel after the war: 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948\_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli\_War#Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War#Jews)

This mentions not only the reasons mentioned in the above article for the emigration of Jews out Arab nations, but other further reasons, as well as mentioned the huge amount of immigrant Jews into Israel from many countries and places around the world, which addresses the ""question"" of the above article of why are there so few Jews nowadays in so many places that used to have big communities of them.",,/r/europe/comments/nff9yc/eu_criticises_israeli_bombing_of_gaza_strip_media/gypn9an/,Killerfist,1621440684

A temporary occupation of some sparsely populated areas is a very different situation from a permanent occupation over the whole country.

&gt;What is bullshit. Look up the charter. 

I explained why. Israel militarily prevented Jordan from exercising its function as state.

&gt;And why did Israel occupy the West Bank? Oh yes, because Jordan attacked Israel unprovoked and lost it. That is an entirely legal way of acquiring territory

That's absolutely not a legal way to acquire territory. Even so, they ought to annex it and give its inhabitants civil rights, not prolong the occupation indefinitely. Shit or get of the pot.

&gt; (or are you willing to argue that Poland should give back Prussia to Germany since it illegally occupies that too?).

Let the inhabitants decide instead of keeping them under military control.

&gt; Israel did not prevent Jordan from executing its duties, Jordan did. 

Bullshit. Israel occupies the area, the Jordan state was not able to act. It claimed the ownership and now it has to take the responsibility.

&gt;And the people there had been Jordanians for decades, without opposition.

The Arabs can work, live and drive anywhere they want, go take a look on Israeli highways and city center streets. They even join the army quite regularly.

The Palestinian issue is an entirely different story. All people in the West Bank were Jordanian citizens until 1988, when Jordan stripped them of their civil rights. That was not Israels fault. Actually, Israel gave them autonomy at Oslo. There was no land 'stolen' from anyone, there was land acquired in a defensive war by Israel (remember the Arabs wanting to kill all Jews in 1967? Turns out countries can keep territory needed for defense if they capture it in a defensive war). Also, the issue is more complicated, since all Jews were ethnically cleansed out of cities in the West Bank by the Jordanians, so it is not that clear cut who 'stole' land from who here. 

It is not literally everyday life for Israeli Arabs to get blocked by the army or police. There are incidents, yes, but also often Arab protests controlled by riot control measures, like any other protest. The Israeli Arabs can work, move around and live freely in Israel.

You missed his point. Germany first had to be completely defeated. Then, after they had surrendered and had been fully conquered by the Allies, they could be rebuilt. But it would have been nonsensical to try and do that before they had given up.  Look also at the Pacific side of the conflict, where Japan first had to unconditionally surrender and then they were provided with aid to rebuild.

The source for the case data and positive testing data is here: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

The source for the vaccine data is here: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations

I've had requests for the spreadsheet, so here is the original as of 17th November: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HUFdsIJEXFPcawCd7KC1atBzuzf59bGkeJTJqnURTTk/edit?usp=sharing

The previous one as of 24th December: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZoutqwXmD-npnX_rRZh2Nxm6Sgwwbj8J/view?usp=sharing

The newest one as of 23rd March: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OeaQPQsABA6q1rLPriZ9bYjtM18z524y/view?usp=sharing

I won't be keeping these versions up to date but you can see how the data is entered and calculated. 

**Version Notes**

The ecdc stopped updating data on a daily basis as of 14th December. I figured weekly data wasn't particularly useful and while the worldometer data is not as accurate as an official agency, at least it is daily so people can make informed decisions about it. 

Just so you can see the extend of the variances, here is the data for the 12th, 13th and 14th of December between worldometer and ecdc: https://imgur.com/Y71Nx7o

Some of this will be due to delays in data reporting and methodologies, others will be the source. In order to do a more detailed comparison, you need to look at the data sources on the ecdc and worldometer sites.

The good news is that worldometer data allows me to look wider than just the UK and EU and also has up-to-date testing data, which allows for the positivity data to be more useful and match the case data in terms of time frame. 

I've added vaccination data as of 23 March 2021. This data is sourced separately and is also not always fully up to date - as such, there's a column which includes the data date. Note that I will be reporting as per the data collected by ""Our World in Data"". 

**Schedule**

I will post this chart daily (where possible) during the week, Monday to Friday but I will not update it at weekends because around half of the countries do not update their numbers over the weekend and also it's on a computer I would not otherwise be logging onto, unless there's something particularly notable which requires a weekend update.

**Explaining some numbers**

*What is the 7 day case rate?* 

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it.

The 7 day case rate number in the graph is the number of people in that stadium who would have a coronavirus infection a week later. For example, in the UK on the 8th November the number was 239.7. That means 240 out of 100,000 people in the stadium would have an infection the following week.

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the daily movement*

The daily movement numbers are just how the 7 day case rate is moving up and down each day. The 7 day trend is the most interesting number - it's the sum of all the ups and downs. If you think of the infection as a car then the 7 day case rate is the speed of the coronavirus infection and the 7 day trend is the acceleration (or deceleration) of the infection. If the 7 day trend is red it's accelerating, if it's neither red nor green it's holding steady and if it's green it means it's slowing down (note - a green 7 day rate doesn't mean the infection is shrinking, just that it's slowing down).

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*How can I tell if the infection is shrinking*

You can't infer that from this data, this data only looks and new cases and the rate of change in new cases. The other side of the equation is how many people are recovering from coronavirus in each country. If you think of it like a bath - this is how much water is flowing through the taps. You cannot tell how much water is going down the plughole so you can't tell how much water is in the bath (i.e. the infection level).

*What is testing rate per 100,000?*

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it.

The testing rate is how many of those 100,000 people will have received a coronavirus test in a 7 day period. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the positive test rate*

This is the % of tests taken which are coming back positive. The WHO says countries should aim for this to be 3% or lower and that testing not keeping up with infections if the rate is above 10%. If you don't have enough tests, you restrict access to them to people who are more likely to be infected either by their symptoms or their risk of exposure, and that inflates your numbers.

This number is a ratio of tests completed, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 3% adjusted case rate*

Used to be the 10% rate but has been rebased around 3%. There is also a lower limit at 1% where the impact will be reduced by a factor of 5. 

Countries with a higher positivity rate are not testing enough of their population, so this multiplies their most recent day's case rate by a factor of their positivity rate divided by 3% - for example on 6th April Greece's positivity rate was 6% so their daily case rate was multiplied by 6%/3% = 2

**This is not** an estimate of the true scale of the pandemic within the country** but is a proxy to rank countries by accounting for countries who are showing a lower positive case rate because they're not doing enough testing.

This number accounts for population size AND level of testing within a country, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 7 Day Vaccines per 100,000?*

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it. This is the number of people in the stadium who would have received a vaccine dose of that stadium in a 7 day period. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 1st Dose %*

This is the % of a population who have received their first vaccine dose. It covers total population which includes children so will be lower than the number some sources cite (% of adult population)

*What is the 2nd Dose %*

This is the % of a population who have received all of their vaccine doses to be considered vaccinated (includes single dose vaccines like J&amp;J)

**What are the marks out of 10**

A formula gives every country a score between 1 and 11 for how bad their 10% adjusted case rate is and multiples it by the 1st dose %. The higher the better. 

For the graph on 22nd March, Estonia, at the top of the chart, gets a score of 1; Iceland, at the bottom of the chart, gets a score of 11. Everybody else gets a score somewhere in between. It then multiplies this by the percentage of the population who have received their first vaccine. Since no country has a vaccine rate greater than 90% it is effectively a score between 1 and 10.

What does it mean? It's a score as to how well the country is managing the pandemic - when the score gets close to 10 this means they have very low infection rates and very high vaccination rates. 

This number accounts for population size AND level of testing AND vaccine rates within a country, so you can compare country-by country

**Why sort by the 10% Adjusted Rate?**

Look at Poland on 9th November as an example - their actual 7 day rate was not actually much higher than the UK's (200 vs 160) and is lower than Denmark's (221), but their positive test rate is 49% - basically 1 out of 2 tests came back positive compared to 5% for UK and 2% for Denmark. Poland only test a fraction of their population compared to the UK or Denmark (706  vs 3198 / 8658 per 100,000) so their actual rate of infection is going to be much higher - their 7 day rate is just kept artificially low by the amount of tests they're (not) doing.

The 10% Adjusted Rate accounts for this. 

This method is **not perfect** as countries account for positivity differently. For instance, some countries (e.g. UK, Italy) include lateral flow tests in overall testing rates and positivity whereas other countries (e.g. Germany) only include PCR so their rates will appear higher and testing rates will appear lower. In addition, countries may alter the way they account for things. While it's important to use this metric to help smooth out countries not doing enough testing, remember that it's not perfect and doesn't tell the full story. 

There is no one unbiased source and you should seek to get your information from a range of sources and assess the underlying bias in the information you're reading and the possible agenda that source may have.

**Why is X country not on the list? / Why is this EU-centric / There are non-EU countries above the total**

I originally did refer to this as EU rather than Europe and I had a lot of comments from people about their country being in the data but them not being in the EU. So I removed any reference to the EU. Since then I've had increasing numbers of comments about why this is EU-centric. To be clear - countries above the grey line aren‚Äôt just EU, the reason they‚Äôre above the line is because they were the countries tracked by the ecdc which was the original source of the data.

Since December I‚Äôve had to switch to using worldometer as the ecdc only provide weekly data. As such I added a small basket of additional countries but I added these below the line, because I wanted the data to be comparable for people looking pre- and post- ecdc data. The countries in the basket were those most commonly requested. The only limitation I have is that I need to be able to fit the screenshot on one page. The total number of lines available is 41, so I don‚Äôt have enough lines for all 48-51 European countries (depending on where you draw the line on Europe and which states you recognize). 

Regardless of how I cut this, it seems it‚Äôs going to annoy somebody. But if you have a country that you feel should be represented that isn't and there's enough demand for it, I'm happy to see what I can accommodate.","British, spiritual EU citizen in exile due to Brexit üôÅ",/r/europe/comments/ng41v8/7_day_case_rate_positivity_rate_and_vaccination/gyoq4i6/,sonicandfffan,1621426144

The **empire** in Ottoman **Empire** is there for a reason.

&gt; empire *(noun)*: an extensive group of **states** or **countries** ruled over by a single monarch, an oligarchy, or a sovereign state.

The idea of Servres was also to place majority Christian (not majority Armenian) regions under control of a non-Muslim entity, in this case Armenia. 

This was not about Muslims vs Armenians which is usually how this is framed by Turkish users where the narrative somehow equates Muslims to Turks, but it was about Muslims vs Christians for the state which wanted an Islamic state (and later a Turkish state), or Christian control (vs Muslim control) from the perspective of the Sevres Treaty.

Regardless, Sevres Treaty does not void the fact that the Turkish Nationalist Movement was about eradicating any political presence of non-Turks and of a people who were not compatible with the idea of future Turkish state for Turks and for Muslims, and to achieve that it continued the genocidal policy of the CUP regime.",,/r/europe/comments/nfmzc7/102_years_ago_on_this_day_turkish_war_of/gyofz2z/,Idontknowmuch,1621418914

&gt;Article 3 the Movement consists of ""Muslims who have given their allegiance to Allah"".[1]

&gt;Article 13 There is no negotiated settlement possible. Jihad is the only answer.[1]

&gt;Article 22 Makes sweeping claims about Jewish influence and power.[1][30] It specifically claims that the Jews were responsible for instigating multiple revolutions and wars, including the French Revolution, World War I, and the Russian Revolution. It also claims that Jews control the United Nations, and that they are supported by ""the imperialistic forces in the Capitalist West and Communist East.""[1]

&gt;The 1988 Charter claimed that the Jews deserved God's/Allah's enmity and wrath because they received the Scriptures but violated its sacred texts, disbelieved the signs of Allah, and slew their own prophets.[38] It quotes a saying of Muhammad from a hadith:

&gt;The Day of Judgment will not come until Muslims fight the Jews, when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say, 'O Muslim, O servant of God, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.' Only the Gharkad tree would not do that, because it is one of the trees of the Jews.

That is a pretty big leap dude, especially considering China doesn't have any disputes with Russia today. It would be an insane turnaround.

The old man is pretty vocal about what he wants though - the MMA's fighter's death.

&gt;It would translate to the conflict: Communication, strengthening of the moderate Palestinian party (which got basically wiped out by the Hamas with the help of the Israeli government), building of infrastructure in Gaza, bilateral projects, exchange and so on. If you support the population of Gaza and lift them out of their extreme poverty, the support of Hamas will be gone.

Eh, Gaza is de-facto independent with Hamas as its government. Israel is not present there. And Hamas rules with an iron fist and doesn't allow any opposition within Gaza's borders. So all your suggestions literally involve an invasion and occupation of Gaza. You can guess how well it would go.

Israel maintains there was a Hamas base there and it demolished the building (empty, mind you).

&gt; Yet I think they are forced to deliver, because that is what they said (or even believe) what Brexit is all about.

I disagree, Brexit is all about the UK leaving the EU. The ability to strike bilateral trade deals is only one aspect (supposed benefit) of this decision, there's also full sovereignty over immigration policy, as well as greater regulatory, fiscal and legal autonomy.

Trade deals matter optically because they represent easy wins, one would have to be quite naive of how international trade works to believe that the UK wouldn't be considerably more dynamic and flexible in pursuing FTAs than the EU is - and (whether it happens or not) the fact that the govt is in touching distance of a deal with Australia after only 5 months vindicates that.

Ultimately, the distances involved and the general public preference for buying local means that the risk to British farming is vastly overstated, but you can't expect the relevant lobby groups to take *anything* lying down. 

This is echoed by Sam Lowe of the CER, but I think he is misguided when he suggests that a failure to find agreement with Australia will kill the idea of 'global britain', after all there are lots of countries (Australia included, plus the likes of Japan, Switzerland, Canada etc..) who all continue to open up trade despite (in most cases) much stronger lobbying interests for their domestic industries.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/nf1lom/uk_government_split_over_australia_trade_deal/gyo971y/,MyFavouriteAxe,1621412741

&gt;Marc Van Ranst (born in Bornem on 20 June 1965) is a professor at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) and the Rega Institute for Medical Research. On 1 May 2007 he was appointed as *Interministerial comissionar* by the Belgian federal government to prepare Belgium for an influenza pandemic. 

-

&gt;Van Ranst is very active on social media, particularly Twitter, where he addresses both professional and societal issues.[6] In August 2014, he was the first person who used the term *Gazacaust* that created heavy reactions in the Jewish community in Belgium and abroad.[7][8] Van Ranst is also a target of social media campaigns by right-wing Flemish nationalists in Belgium, for instance, in 2018 former migration minister Theo Francken nick-named Van Ranst as *Doctor Hatred*.[9]

Countries should focus on vaccinating as many people as possible as quickly as possible because effectively even a single dose does all we really need (prevents death and hospitalization). Denmark recently seems to have shifted towards doing a lot of 2nd doses. I think it would be better to wait longer with the 2nd vaccines and give more people a first shot instead.

3879,"&gt;Private healthcare in the UK is minuscule and still relies on NHS staff and resources, the public/private split in terms of facilities is 94/6 and 78/22 in terms of spending.

Which is completely irrelevant if your concern is seeing someone in the private sector. The only thing the private sector will not do is urgent ops or anything serious, which they will dump on the NHS because it's not worth their time. And if it's anything urgent or serious you will be seen fast in the NHS.

&gt;It is not normal to wait weeks for an x-ray to be read or to be bumped around waiting referrals and months for routine operations. 

As already mentioned, feel free to go private.

&gt;Nobody has copied the NHS system and other than the activist Commonwealth Fund (With a former NHS director on its board) nobody rates it very highly. European ratings constantly place the NHS mid-table in their rankings.

Actually lots of other countries have copied the Bevridge system, that you are ignorant of it does not change it.

And no one other than you has brought up rankings. The NHS gets middling results for minimal funding.

&gt;I dont think copying those countries is doable practically, so the next best thing would be the German model.

Subsequently, Croatia declared independence and the dissolution of its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991, but it introduced a three-month moratorium on the decision when urged to do so by the European Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 

The war in Croatia escalated during the moratorium, and on 8 October 1991, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. In 1992, the countries of the European Economic Community granted Croatia diplomatic recognition and Croatia was admitted to the United Nations.

The breakup of Yugoslavia occurred as a result of a series of political upheavals and conflicts during the early 1990s. After a period of political and economic crisis in the 1980s, constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia split apart, but the unresolved issues caused bitter inter-ethnic Yugoslav wars.

I showed plenty of examples of why Israel is an apartheid ethno-state,  but you refuse to address it,  because it is not convenient to you. 

I get angry,  when people belittle human life and have no problem with innocent people being murdered, forced to leave their homes and lands and made to live in misery.  

Even more so angry because you are using the ""modern democratic,  multicultural,  multiracial"" as an excuse for committing atrocities .  
Even if they applied to Israel, that still would not excuse them for the crimes they are doing and have done.  Yeah it is multicultural and multiracial alright,  but not all cultures and races in it are equal and treated equal. South Africa was also multicultural and multiracial right? No apartheid state there right. 
US is a modern and democratic country,  that does not excuse its decades of wars in the ME and else,  as well as the massive bombing of civilians it has done (same for other countries in the west participating).

  Heck,  the US was modern and democratic for its time,  especially compared to the natives of NA, so when they committed genocide towards the indigenous population of NA,  it was okey then  right? The US was also enslaving thousands of black people,  but it was a modern,  democratic and very multicultural  and multiracial,  so no problem there too right?  

The British Empire had also all those characteristics too,  when it did its horrible massive colonization around the world and all atrocities that came with it. 

Modern,  democratic,  multicultural and multiracial state can still do all kinds of crimes again humanity, those things dont give them a pass. So,  yes,  it is quite angering when you are thinking that such a state can do any type of horrific atrocity because it fulfills those criteria in one way or another.

4144,"Yeah sure mate.

In Israel, citizenship and nationality are two separate, independent concepts. In other words, Israel is¬†**not**¬†the state of its citizens, but the state of the Jewish people. Thus Arabs in Israel have Israeli passports but they do not have rights equal to those of Jewish citizens.

This is not merely discrimination in practice, but discrimination by law.

 For example, the Law of Return and Absentees‚Äô Property Law are but two examples of flagrant racism and discrimination in the Israeli legal system

This is not some old, odd oversight, but a very deliberate part of the design of Israeli society. This is periodically reinforced whenever some Israelis petition the Supreme Court to recognize an Israeli nationality that does not discriminate based on ethnicity.

A recent example of these petitions was in 2013, where the Supreme Court rejected such an idea on the grounds that it would ‚Äúundermine Israel‚Äôs Jewishness‚Äú

Having Arabs members in Knesset doesn't mean anything. Rhodesia also allowed a certain number of black parliamentarians, but it was still a racist entity ruled by a white minority, with the very honest declared goal of maintaining itself as a white state.

- Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.

4408,"&gt;There's literally enough uranium for thousands of years.
&gt;

Source? The IPCC puts us at ""over 130 years"" with our current resources. Much more uranium exists, but we should not bet on anyone pumping hundreds of billions of euros towards extraction R&amp;D when we can build cheaper energy in other ways. And mind you that those 130 years obviously drop as more nuclear power plants are built.


&gt;Also uranium fuel cost for electricity production is a negligible part of the total cost. 
&gt;

Absolutely, what makes nuclear such a horrible investment is its initial investment costs. Running a nuclear power plant isn't that expensive.

Already existing nuclear power plants are generally used until you just can't anymore, because they're cheap. Meanwhile, **3/4 of the most expensive buildings of all time** are Nuclear power plants currently under construction.

&gt;Other interesting fact: France has 3 years of uranium reserves.  For comparison, most countries have only a few weeks/months petrol reserves.

4519,"&gt; Your original point is that islam is worse than other religions. It‚Äôs a shit point 

No it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a fact. Religions like Sikhism and Buddhism co exists with other religions even in Europe, US, Canada &amp; Australia . Sikh‚Äôs are particularly well received in the west. 
And religions like Hinduism has co existed in minority nations better than Islam ( it yeah they are complete shit in India now). 
Hindu terrorism is almost existent outside India except few isolated cases. Actions speak louder than words. Christianity is not a threat in minority nations like India, Sri Lanka etc Period. Whereas Islam has conflicts in almost all nations where they have a sizeable presence. 

&gt; Oh so now it's radical islam, not islam in general? That is not what you were claiming so far. 

Yeah like the absence of Radical is gonna make a big difference. Shit bro.. you just made all my claims and proof vanish into thin air by pointing out this. 

&gt; Sure, radical islam is terrible, so is radical anything. Have you ever spoken to christian fundamentalisms? 

Here we go again. Christian bad bad. 

&gt; But are they shrinking because of islam or because of politics? 

In Islamic nations religion = politics. You would know that. Or are you conveniently ignoring it? How many Islamic nations are autocratic or dictatorship and how many are democratic? Even among the democratic countries how many has a complete separation of state and religion? In Islamic nations Islam always comes first. 

&gt; If it were because of religion then how could they have survived for over 1000 years?

Islam is 1500 years old so it‚Äôs not a surprise they survived for 1000 years. Give it another 1000 years and we‚Äôll see what happens. I‚Äôve Already responded to this claim. Their numbers are shrinking. Are you gonna wait till the death or conversion of the last ever Christian or Jew in every Islamic nation to finally change your mind? Suit yourself. 

&gt; Have you considered the possibility that maybe the reason there is more violence now is not because of what has been in the Quran for all those centuries but because of political developments in the last century?  That maybe the source of this new violence isn't an old book, but recent meddling?

Is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen part of western meddling? Or Pakistan‚Äôs Bengal genocide or the persecution of Ahhamadiya Muslims too because of the west? 

Everything is politics mate and a countries religious ideology has a great influence on the politics. What type of people votes for Trump and Bolsonaro? The conservative Christians.

4594,"&gt;No, we're talking about Israeli Arabs and Palestinian Arabs, I made the deliberate distinction because of the situation in respects to Palestine.

Many Palestinian Arabs are Israeli citizens. Residents of the OPT are not relevant to this discussion because they don't fall under 'tiered citizenship based on ethnicity'

&gt;Erm, the 40.8% is the majority of the pollng. 

No, it's merely the largest individual segment.

&gt;Anyway, the HRW report is hardly a paragon of impartiality, considering it's numerous flaws described here in its methodology

They seem to be mostly criticisms from the regions that it has reported against, including Israel. *""credulous of civilian witnesses in places like Gaza and Afghanistan"" but ""skeptical of anyone in a uniform.""* sounds just right for investigating human rights violations.

&gt;Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung is a German organisation.

They fund it, but it's actually run out of Tel Aviv University by the husband of a Munich massacre victim. It has to be acknowledged that Israel has robust free speech and tolerates criticism internally, but also generates a lot of propaganda for external use.

&gt;Never said it was a panacea, but representation matters, which you seem to think it doesn't. Pretty hard to run an ethnostate if you have Arab generals and Arabs in the judiciary.

Well it hasn't helped in Israel's case, they still discriminate against Arab citizens.

&gt;You're talking about citizens of Israel who primarily identify as Palestinian, I'm talking about the Israeli Arab community seperate from that.

You've change the argument. I brought up Israel specifically as an example of the endgame of 'tiered citizenship based on class'. How badly they treat everyone else is not relevant in that context.

&gt;Again, I have no expectations Palestinians, citizens of Israel or otherwise, will be treated equitably ...

Of course not, you support internment.

&gt;So what, doesn't mean Palestinians will be treated equally before the law, you're talking about the desired outcome, not the actual outcome.

In a lawful state, there would be consequences for breaking the Geneva Convention. There may still be.

&gt;...however, with that being said, plenty of Israeli Arabs have gone on to work in Israels government, military and judiciary.

You are fine with how Arab citizens are treated in Israel and you don't really have a problem with citizenship based on ethnicity; sounds like future Britain will suit you - as long as you have the right genetic background.

&gt;Because they're not a sovereign state, just like England and Wales, do you have some sort of problem of fathoming this concept?

You're the one arguing for 'Home Rule', I'm just explaining how useless it is, using Scotland as an example. They've got Home Rule and an independence party in power and it doesn't count for much.

&gt;... setting up a whole tax infrastructure is expensive and labourious when you can instead just use the existing tax collecting infrastructure set up and adjust it to reflect the new circumstances, which is exactly what happened in Scotland, it isn't some nefarious plan of control.

Scotland want to be able to control their own taxes, they've been fobbed off with limited rate setting powers. If you think handing over tax collection is uninmportant then you don't understand how power is held or used.

&gt;Because I've tried to explain to you many times that none of the nations within the United Kingdom are sovereign, so saying it's an ""English exchequer"" Etc is missing the mark by quite a bit because England can't have an exchequer just like Scotland cannot.

That wasn't my point, but why were you being facetious?

&gt;You mean the largest city in the United Kingdom? Omg, it's like Dublin being the economic and political centre of the Republic Of Ireland.

Ireland is decentralising its civil service. Now, why can't the UK do that?

&gt;Except they didn't do that during the Boer war, so you're talking bollocks.

They rounded up everyone during the Boer war, without distinction. Presuming you're not being facetious again, the explanation is that Britain has a recent history of state violence based on dividing the citizenry.

&gt;And as Palestinians I don't expect them to be treated equally in Israeli law because of the situation surrounding Palestine. Hence why I made the distinction between Israeli Arabs and Palestinians.

We're going backwards here, Israeli Arabs are also Palestinians. Is this like the '*inconvenient*' vs '*distracted*' thing or do you actually not get this distinction?

&gt;No, France and Spain sending troops over to support a candidate which a substantial amount of people in the UK supported is supplicating an already existing internal threat.

And who had possession of these candidates? James and Charles were in the employ of the French and Spanish armies.

&gt;... and considering Jerseys patrol boat is this I think Jersey appreciates the back up.

According to the Guardian,[the Jersey Government are looking to compromise with France](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/06/what-jersey-fishing-rights-dispute-boris-johnson-patrol-boats). Unlike Britain, they need to live with France. 

&gt;Except it did

More *'lol no its not'*. There was no territorial infringement, that only happens when there is a state-backed incursion. The rest is just British hysterics

&gt;Because it's not just a coastal defence vessel, it's part of the Overseas Patrol Squadron, which is the oldest part of the RN and is primarily tasked with defending British fisheries.

Nobody was fishing illegally, in fact they were protesting against the revocation of their licences, in contravention to the trade agreement. But sure, send artillery along to a protest, Britain has previous here.

&gt;Because the time and persistence of the incursions means an overall approach to the resolution of the problem rather than focusing on one particular incident is more preferable.

Is it that you don't know what 'incursion' means? 'an invasion or attack' - this was clearly neither of those things.

&gt;It's almost as if having a large navy is prefential for an island nation to protect its trade.

That's not really how things are done this century.

&gt;Yes it will, because it will have to gauge any action by the reaction of the US and its allies.

I wouldn't rely too much on the US - China are more important to them.

&gt;Just another goalpost moved, this is pathetic.

So show me where you think this positive French sentiment lies.  


&gt;Except they weren't used against Spanish fishermen.

So what does Britain have them for again? 

&gt;The British built Irelands ships, but again you're definitely not an Anglophobe with these comments.

4796,"We fundamentally disagree so I don't think there's much point continuing this conversation much further than this. We'll soon be going in a circle. My quotations are broken so I apologise in advance. 

It is important for the US, they aren't giving them money and showing pretty much universal support for no reason. The belief is Israel is important for them and they don't do shit out of the goodness of their own heart. What are the reasons for this constant support? With Turkey's current leadership, Israel is probably looking even better for them. Why do you think this conflict gets so much attention compared to others? There's a dozen other similar conflicts that you don't hear about at all, why? Because Israel is viewed as important for the West. 

I did say it was easy for me to say multiple times. I'm not in their situation and my experience are different. Likewise, I have changed countries and cities multiple times. My resources and means are probably different from the average Palestinian also. 

Lebanon is a completely different story. One, the main reason for the war was crushed the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). Two, they got pushed back by Hezbollah which is backed by Iran. It has nothing to do with the Arab wars they fought before (maybe Palestine should get some backing from Iran, but Iran would have done it by now if they cared). The first conflict ended with Israel withdrawing. While the second ended with a peace treaty negotiation lead by the UN which Lebanon broke their end of the deal and Israel didn't (maybe a good sign for Palestine). BTW Hezbollah at least it's military branch (although most consider the entire party) is recognised as a terrorist organisation by many countries include the EU and most of the Arab League. They have committed many acts of terrorism to several countries and not just Israel. I'm sorry that I disagree with Jihad terrorists that will not be happy until Israel is completely destroyed. Which won't happen unless Iran goes to war, Israel refuses to use their nukes, and the US does nothing to support them.

Jordan-Israel relation are not the best but neither of them have broken their peace deal (these things seem to stop conflicts weird). Jordan is also pushing and has been asking Palestine to broker a peace deal for decades which is still Palestine best play. This is a complete hypothetical with nothing suggesting this is going to happen any time soon.

What you have isn't strong enough to even harm them, and when you asked for help it didn't work.

There, the phrase ‚Äúthe continent‚Äù refers to the countries occupying the mainland of Europe. Therefore, a ‚Äúcontinental breakfast‚Äù denotes the type of breakfast you'd be served in places like France or Italy.

This is an old saying as stated above from the mid 19th Century. Now it denotes the difference between an uncooked and cooked breakfast. The continental breakfast option is simply a lighter and cheaper options when staying in a hotel and B&amp;B.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/neph7g/european_country_elimination_game/gyjoicv/,DynamoStranraer,1621326043

4868,"So they were basically looking for the title of ""president"" but couldn't find it.

I am somewhat surprised that they didn't go for ""consul"", which is what the leaders of Rome were called during the Republic. But I guess they wanted to show Napoleon had more power than a consul, which had to share power with a 2nd consul, so they chose the title used by more autocratic rulers, starting with Octavian. 

&gt;Napoleon's reign lasted until 22 June 1815, when he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo, exiled and imprisoned on the island of Saint Helena, where he died on 5 May 1821.

Well, technically, Waterloo was during the 100 day reign, so by that time he had already lost (in Russia) and been deported to Elba.

4876,"&gt; It was founded in 9th century and since then was the part of Kievan Rus‚Äô. And it‚Äôs mine ‚Äúhometown‚Äù cuz my childhood belongs to Smolensk. Beautiful city, try to visit it once. But you saying about Smolensk only after 1500s. So in your theory Grand Duchy of Moscow came there and took this land just for fun? And before 1502 there was no such a city? Unbelievable.

Yes because Smolensk is relevant for Polish-Russian struggle only after 1408 when it became part of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Before that it was independent and even before that it was part of Kievan Rus. Grand Duchy of Moscow, direct predecessor to today's Russia, gain control over the city for the first time in 1514. So in 1609 they controlled the city for 95 years. From your perspective, the city was always part of Russia, but back then it wasn't.

&gt; Tsardom of Russia got Times of Troubles (or ‚ÄúSmuta‚Äù) and PLC took advantage of weakness and conquered the city

That's how it works. You attack when the enemy is weak. Today's nationalization of history always create a picture where your country was never at fault, but it wasn't like that. Like in Russo-Polish War (1654‚Äì1667) Where in the middle of Swedish Deluge (You think Times of Troubles was a disaster? The Deluge hit Poland-Lithuania worse than WWII) Russia supported Khmelnytsky Uprising. Not to mention The Partitions and September 1939.

Let‚Äôs say there is a couple who works in financial industry in Frankfurt. They want to buy a house and normally they‚Äôd look around Frankfurt so they can commute to the office. The prices are 600 - 800k

Now with the home office going for some year and a half they may not be willing to go back to the office based work. They have noticed that in the countryside    houses go for 150k.

They may decide to buy the house for 150k and if their current employer cancels home office when the pandemic ends the couple will find another employer that offers work from home even if they would have to take a pay cut.
The difference in mortgage would still make it worthwhile.

Although the crusading movement continued for several more centuries, the capture of the city marked the end of further crusades to the Levant. When Acre fell, the Crusaders lost their last major stronghold of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. 

They still maintained a fortress at the northern city of Tartus (today in north-western Syria), engaged in some coastal raids, and attempted an incursion from the tiny island of Ruad, but when they lost that as well in 1302 in the siege of Ruad, the Crusaders no longer controlled any part of the Holy Land.",,/r/europe/comments/nf14n0/18_may_1291_fall_of_acre_the_end_of_crusader/gyj6wo6/,Vucea,1621312169

I asked my Israeli friend why Israel is illegally expanding and ethnic cleansing Palestinians? He said because this land was promised to us by god, so we're taking it back. Unlike you and Israeli government, at least he was honest.

5186,"The social distancing measures that were introduced as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic forced many people to work from home. In 2020, 12.3% of employed people aged 15-64 in the EU usually worked from home, although this share had remained constant at around 5% over the past decade.  
  
In previous years, the share of self-employed persons who reported that they usually work from home has been consistently higher than the share of employees in the same situation. However, the gap became smaller in 2020 as the share of employees who usually work from home increased from 3.2% in 2019 to 10.8%, while the share for the self-employed increased to a smaller extent: from 19.4% in 2019 to 22.0% in 2020.  
  
**More women than men work from home**  
  
There are different trends according to the age and sex of workers when it comes to home working. In 2020, a higher share of women (13.2%) reported that they usually worked from home than men (11.5%).  
  
Compared with other age groups, younger people were less likely to work from home in 2020: only 6.3% of those aged 15-24 reported that they usually worked from home, compared with 13.0% of those aged between 25-49 and 12.4% of those aged 50-64.

**Highest share of people working from home in Finland, Luxembourg and Ireland**  
  
Finland topped the list of the EU Member States for home working, with 25.1% of employed people usually working from home in 2020. Finland was followed by Luxembourg (23.1%) and Ireland (21.5%). In contrast, the lowest shares of home-workers were reported in Bulgaria (1.2%), Romania (2.5%), Croatia (3.1%) and Hungary (3.6%).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/nf0jpf/work_from_home_in_the_eu_finland_topped_the_list/gyj3si9/,filosoful,1621310234

5335,"First, I'll like to say this has been the most civilized conversation I ever had regarding Palestine vs Israel so, thanks for that. 

Honestly, I have no solution or way out for Palestine. They are in a practical impossible situation right now. In my opinion Israel is the only that can stop this. Which is a slim chance because they gain nothing and face no real repercussions from their actions. Obviously even if Israel stops no action violent action can be taken by Palestine to reclaim their stolen land because it would restart the conflict. Negotiations could help stop or at least buy time and it would make it harder for Israel to justify their actions. 

However, I'm no political expert and my knowledge on the matter is definitely not an even close to an authority on this issue. This is a very complex matter that is not easily solvable. I don't think using violence is going to change anything since it hasn't worked before and it only cost more lives. A diplomatic solution is the best hope for the Palestinians and pray that Israel keeps their end of the bargain.

TL;DR I believe Palestine is mostly fucked and at the mercy of Israel at the moment. Palestine will never ""win"" this conflict and their land will slowly be taken over by Israel. A peace deal with a two state solution is the only thing that hasn't been tried yet. If accepted, it still requires Israel's good will for it to work.

Or that Palestinians squandered almost all support they had in the region, with activities such as: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September where they tried to assassinate the king of Jordan and organise a coup.

5490,"Hmmm is this Brexit or is this Covid travel bans? These cases only seem to be occurring since these travel restrictions came in to force unless there were any issues in January. The UK entry requirements are quite clear on the government website. Another news story had acknowledged that the ""victims"" had not completed the required documents or provided covid test, hence their return. Having said that the lack of access to medication is a concern and should be looked in to (but judging by the rest of their story I'm not so sure they're being 100% truthful).

The story of the ""non"" Au Pair I find strange as under the domestic covid restrictions in place in Feb she would not legally even have been able to be inside their house, unless in a professional capacity... Which would mean she was being employed as an au pair, despite claiming the contrary, again hence her return.

If you make unnecessary international travel during a global pandemic and do not follow the rules of the host country, then you'll most probably will be treated like a criminal because...you are breaking British law (all be it temporary).

These attacks are obviously motivated by anti-semitism because synagogues in European cities represent the local Jewish community, not Israel. And European Jews are European citizens, not Israeli.
