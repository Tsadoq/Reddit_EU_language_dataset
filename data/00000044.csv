I drive trucks for a living so am used to driving 10hrs/450-500 miles a day and thought it would be a good idea to drive the 1000 miles back in one hit, just stopping for fuel, toilet and Eurotunnel. I'd actually planned a stopover at Rouen on the way back up but when I got there I felt fresh still so decided to cancel the room I'd booked and crack on. Yeah, no maybe not the best decision I ever made. I was OK in France as driving there is super easy compared to the nightmare of the UK and most of the way back up the A1 in the UK I was OK.

I tried not to be too detailed so if you have questions feel free to ask. 

Estonia:

Health checks are free unless you want to do very specific tests yourself. If your general doc doesnt think its necessary then you can also go to private clinic that have health packages and you pay for it.

Prescription meds are partially covered by insurance(25-90%)

Dental is covered for children under 19( electives such as braces arent unless there is a medical need). 
Elderly/ disabled/ pregnant/ mother with under 1-year old/ unavoidable care is subsidised as well. Regular adults can use 40 eur(covers up to 50%).

You have to buy your glasses yourself. 

You dont have to any pay pregnancy related medical costs even if you dont have state insurance. 
If you are unable to work due to pregnancy, you get 80% of your average wage. Also, when your kid gets sick you also get 80% and when you yourself get sick then you get 70% from 2nd or 4th day at home depending on the company.

I have never heard about us having childcare at hospitals but regular childcare prices are subsidised even private ones.

And they might as well be, but along that comes the rethoric of rejection of socialism on entirety. One could almost say, somewhat quoting the Polish constitution, that whatever 'leftist' policies they might have (and it's not that much, especially in case of PO), they are arising from an entirely different sources 

Nobody in Poland treats Marx as a serious philosopher, and treating him as such would seem similarly outdated as seriously considering merits of the feudal system. His books can be mostly found in paper recycling centers though.

Poles probably are not particularly more allergic to leftist *policies* per se than the rest of the world, but parties openly using leftist rethoric, and treating leftist thought as something that does not belong to garbage bin of history yet, are on the serious risk of not passing the electoral threshold.","Warsaw, Poland",/r/europe/comments/kx21ph/countries_of_eu_by_ruling_partys_european/gjk2xsq/,nieuchwytnyuchwyt,1610870660

But your last sentence suddenly contains meaning. As we have found out, ""the whole nation"" is an unsubstantiated statement of Estonian propagandists, who for some reason you call historians. Learned historians do not use such concepts as ""the whole nation"". They operate with documents and numbers.

So, as far as I know, the Bolshevik party was very popular in Estonia. Still, there were slightly fewer Estonians who were armed supporters of the Bolsheviks than there were armed separatists.

And in such situations, to say ""the whole nation"" and ""marginals"", this is exactly what national propaganda and the formation of the necessary myth.

167,"You treat it as if historians have one agreed consensus. Plenty of historians for Macedonia and Alexander like NGL Hammond who believed they were a distinct people eventually to the conclusion they were Greeks, same with Robin Lane Fox for example. Also, more evidence has come out of the language they spoke along with implications ranging from the Pella Cuese Tablet, Persians calling Macedonians 'yauna takabara' (Greeks wearing hats) and Hesiod. While it is fragmented and some historians like Eugene Borza or Badian don't think there is a defintivie answer others like the afforementioned Nicholas Hammond do. Also, although fragmented most Macedonian cities, names and remaining words from the native dialect are Greek with some having an unknown origin or being loan words from neighbouring tribes like the Thracians.

Here are some examples demonstrating they believe  Ancient Macedonians are Greek.

""He was still in a world of Greek gods and sacrifices, of Greek plays and Greek language,though the natives might speak Greek with a northern accent which hardened 'ch' into 'g','th' into 'd' and pronounced King Philip as Bilip."" ~ Robin Lane Fox, Alexander the Great, pg. 30

""There were two parts of the Greek-speaking world at this time which did not suffer from revolution and did not seek to impose rule over the city states. In Epirus there were three clusters of tribal states, called Molossia, Thesprotia and Chaonia[...]the other part of the Greek-speaking world extended from Pelagonia in the north to Macedonia in the south. It was occupied by several tribal states, which were constantly at war against Illyrians, Paeonians and Thracians."" ~ NGL Hammond, Genius of Alexander, pg. 12-13

""Thucydides regarded the semi-nomadic, armed northerners of Epirus and western Macedonia as ""barbarians"", and he called them such in his history of events in 429 and 423. The word was understood by some scholars to mean ""non-Greek-speakers"" rather than ""savages."" They were shown to be mistaken in 1956, when inscriptions of 370-68, containing lists of Greek personal names and recording in the Greek language some acts of the Molossians, were found at Dodona in Epirus."" ~ NGL Hammond, The Miracle That Was Macedonia",,/r/europe/comments/ky8lbg/new_alexander_the_great_series_to_be_filmed_in/gjk4ydt/,TyrannosaurusRekt238,1610872578

191,"No, domestic terrorism can take many different forms, it's not just limited to bombing public institutions. Going after elected politicians, like you say, with the intent to capture and possibly harm and kill them is not just rioting, it's terrorism. Using violence to enforce your political views is nothing but. Add to that the attempt of an insurrection by trying to overthrow the elected parliament and you have a serious attack on democracy itself.

&gt;By your logic none of the colonies should've freed themselves from Britain, the Athenians shouldn't have overthrown the rulling class, Ivaylo the cabagge shouldn't have overthrown the Tzar because he abandoned northern Bulgarian villages and left them to the Tatars, etc. 

Even trying to draw parallels to these events is nothing but ludicrous, so I'm not even going to comment any further on that. And no, I wouldn't accept this insurrection as anything but what it is. A petty attempt of terrorism because their candidate lost an election. No way around that.

You can't criticize them because they think it's justified? Great, ISIS also think their goals are satisfied, so who are we to arrest and send drones after them? It's not about what they think is justified, it is about what objectively is justified and storming the Capitol because your candidate lost is anything but.

204,"A western European lecturing Americans about their most important alliances.

Western Europe isn't actually as important in the 21st century, so it's very debatable if the first half of the headline is even true anymore. Everything now hinges on containing the CCP, not the CCCP. If the major countries in the EU are going to continue to turn a blind eye to everything that China does, then how important are they, actually? And why would the relationship with western Europe ever have any kind of priority in the minds of American voters if that's the case?

Personally, I'm convinced that America and Europe have to work together to counter China. If you want to call yourselves the most important allies of America, though, you have to actually back that up by demonstrating your alleged value once in a while.

292,"My knowledge is for Germany and Bulgaria. Both are similar, just the BG system is much more inexpensive.

In both cases you pay a monthly healthcare ?tax?, which is based on your income. It varies between 250 and 750 Euros per month. You can and sign a private healthcare contract. The payment is based not on your income, but on your need for healthcare, meaning that when you are younger, you pay less, when you are older you pay much more. And I mean much much more, like upwards of 2000 Euros per month! The private healthcare might give you more amenities, such as being in a single room.

&amp;#x200B;

The private healthcare should at least cover what the government healthcare covers:

 

\&gt;If you have healthcare insurance through employer, will you have the following for free?

You always have your insurance, even when you are unemployed. Generally, there is no difference between the insurance, unless you get a private insurance through your employer, which is getting less and less common.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Free health checks at any hospitals.

Yes

\&gt;Free or greatly reduced prices on medications.

Yes

\&gt;Free dental work like cleaning.

Yes

\&gt;Free prescription eye glasses.

I don't wear myself glasses, but to my knowledge, only the basic models are free.

\&gt;Reimbursement of pregnancy costs.

Yes

\&gt;Free child care at children's hospitals.

Yes

\&gt;Reduced premiums for no claims in a calendar year.

There used to be something like this in the past, but I think they scrapped it.

&amp;#x200B;

Generally, I am very happy with the healthcare system in Germany. I seldom have to pay anything out of the pocket and the quality I get is pretty good. In Bulgaria, you do need to pay something like 1 Euro for each visit (maybe outdated), but if you visit the hospitals, which are payed by the healthcare provider, you will get really shitty quality. This is why most people go to private hospitals, where you need to pay a lot from your own pocket.

309,"Ok so I'd say I'm a middle ground between both of you. Because I do think public servants shouldn't wear religious signs, but I think it was a mistake to forbid religious signs at school.

I also aknowledge that even though the law and its application should be to *every* religion, it is nowadays misused, and that Christian do have it better than Muslim.

For the public servant thing: yes it does matter whether or not the cop you're talking to has religious signs. Let's never forget that cops are bastards. They aren't your friends, and they will do whatever they want with the power that has been given to them. It is also important to say that 70% of French police and military are right-winger.

""A police officer isn't a judge he has no say in what I'm reporting charges."" Well it isn't because he has no say in this that he will keep quite. Same for a doctor. And no, they won't be punished if they go out of their way. It just never happens.

Now, imagine I'm a left winger and I've been attacked by a right-winger and I want to press charges. I won't feel comfortable if the cop in front of me is wearing a right wing T-Shirt. Now you're saying the police officer has no say and isn't a judge. That should be true. But it just factually aren't true. It has been shown numerous times over and over during the last decade that cops are being blatantly racist, homophobes, sexist etc. Going as far as not properly handling some cases. With that I mind, I wouldn't want to tell them someone they agree with beat me up. Because at best they won't care, at bad they'll make fun of me and kick my ass.

It's the same for doctors. They theoretically shouldn't judge you and still operate you. But once again it sadly isn't how things are happening in real life. Even with our laws a lot of doctors and pharmacist are going out of their way by refusing to do abortion, give abortion pills etc. It would be much worse and more prevalent without those laws.

So yes, a woman going to the doctor because she wants to take the pill or abort, and the find the doctor is a practising believer (no matter the religion, the 3 monotheists ones are against it) I wouldn't feel comfortable having to talk to someone judging me (because even if they don't say it they can still think it) or even giving bad advice. It has been reported many times that women who wanted to abort have been lied to and/or pressure in order to give the baby. Once again, I assure you it would be worse without our la√Øcit√©.

Those people represent the state, and you shouldn't feel oppressed by the state because of your political leaning (because like it or not, a majority of religious people are right leaning), sexual orientation or something else.

BUT yes I do agree that believers should be able to wear whatever they want at school, well at least after a certain age. 16 seems a nice age, before would be too young imo. And also yes even though this law is supposed to applied (and theorically it does apply to every religion) to everyone, Christian have more slack about what they do.

But it is not because the law isn't correctly applied that it is inherently bad. It does need improvement though.

Also for the whole Holliday thing. Our Hollidays are from Christian origine yes, but they haven't been Christian for a long time ago. Only a tiny tiny proportion of France still consider it a Christian Holliday. For the rest it's just a normal Holliday of ancient Christian roots. And it does make a difference imo. Christmas is just another capitalist Holliday now.
Also, even though it's technically not legal, most Muslims do celebrate Eid and most of my Muslim friends at school did come during the celebration. And it's tolerated by almost everyone. But if Christians were to start a new Holliday celebration I'm sure almost everyone would get mad at it.

Finally, I'm not saying you're wrong about the fact that it affects Muslim women and girls in vulnerable positions. I think you might be quite right actually. But you can't say ""This laws will *only* harm Muslim girls."". A sentence that clearly use the word ""only"", which thus means ""no one else"" in other words, and than say that you never said that it only touches Muslim people when OC is stating that you said it. You used the word only, so just accept that you think it only touches this demographic

Sorry it's quite long and a month after everything. But as I said, you're not right to me so I thought it might be nice to have a some in-depth explanation because OC never gave explicit exemples of why it might be bad for public servants to show their religion. He just stated that it was bad and that's it.

Everyone around has a family history of Holodomor or grandfather being sent to fight Germans without even a gun or uniform. People did talk a lot about Russia being more economically successful. But no one ever expressed a will to join. Chechnya wars, terrorists, you name it. And those who live in Crimea were just heavily brainwashed. They saw reacher Russians coming to spend vacations and navy fleet. 
Please take a look at the national structure from the population census below. For the Crimean peninsula it was the following:

Russians - 1,180.4 (58.3%)
Ukrainians - 492.2 (24.3%)
Crimean Tatars - 243.4 (12.0%)
Belarusians - 29.2 (1.4%)
Tatars - 11.0 (0.5%)
Armenians - (0.4%)

Eiffel Tower for scale:

[Chenab Bridge](https://i.imgur.com/CltJfik.jpg)

[Millau Viaduct](https://i.imgur.com/W7aGVcJ.png)

Structural height and deck height are different things, I'll let [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_bridges#Structural_height_and_deck_height) explain:

&gt;The difference between tall and high bridges can be explained in part because some of the highest bridges are built across deep valleys or gorges. For example, (as of 8 February 2020) the [Duge Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duge_Bridge) is the highest bridge in the world, but only the tenth tallest. This bridge spans a deep river gorge. The bridge's two towers, built on either rim of the gorge, are 269 m (883 ft) tall, but due to the depth of the river gorge, the deck height of the Duge Bridge is 565 m (1,854 ft).

&gt; The [Millau Viaduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millau_Viaduct), is a cable-stayed bridge that is both tall (in structural height) and high (in deck height). The tallest Millau Viaduct tower is situated near the valley floor, which gives the viaduct a structural height of 343 m (1,125 ft), and a deck height of 270 m (890 ft) above the valley floor. The Millau Viaduct is (as of 8 February 2020) the tallest bridge, but only the twenty-sixth highest bridge in the world. 

Chenab Bridge will be the 13th highest bridge by deck height when it opens (assuming the list on Wikipedia is complete): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_bridges
It's structural height is nowhere near the Millau Viaduct.

The Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge is the 4th tallest bridge by structural height (that's the list with the Millau Viaduct on top): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_bridges",Germoney,/r/europe/comments/kyp7pg/the_millau_viaduct_in_france_the_worlds_tallest/gjj88w0/,KaktusKontrafaktus,1610850501

I don't want to defend the SW I am using too hard because I think it is trainwreck :), but if i look up the typical lambda values for bricks used in my country I get lamba's in the 0.45-0.65 range (dry). Plaster is the samish. So for a 25-30cm massive wall with a bit of  plaster on the inside we get roughly a U of 1.5-2.5. So triple glass value(also a worse case value) still wins with 'real' values.

About radiation losses : the U value takes all 3 mechanisms into account, so radiation is accounted for. AFAIK this is more a comfort issue (corresponding to the effect you describe). Also you can install coated windows that reflect most of the radiation back into the room to deal with it.

579,"&gt; I searched some Austrian dished and found something like steak and meatball type foods but these foods aren't signature foods, rarely anybody knew them and for opinion. 

So you got not even the faintest idea what Austrian cuisine is yet you are confident to judge it? Oh boy. 


&gt;I think these indigents can't be grown in Austria or even old Austria-Hungary borders.

All of these very much can be grown in Austria, especially hazelnuts. Irrelevant since pretty much all western countries largely import some or all these. Also, why stop there - how about chocoloate? Oh, I know: because BOOM, your little theory fall flat since all western countries import that.

&gt;So for example, if you took Greek and Austrian cuisine, Greeks have superior cuisine because they are able to create extensive cuisine due to the richness of their environment

never mind how entirely stupid this ""this countries cuisine is superior to that other countries cuisine is"" - how does ones environmental ""richness"" decide how good their cooking is?

Triple glazed IGUs are extremely expensive in comparison to double or single glazed IGUs, and are almost never used in commercial - let alone residential buildings - in my corner of the world. 

I would also not rely upon the generic software used to produce energy certificate/compliance as a source in any type of debate. First, you shouldn‚Äôt be using software as a reference - use industry standards or the actual physical properties of the material assembly. Second, the software that you described is viewed by practitioners (I‚Äôll include myself) as being +/- 25-40% accurate, and are nowhere near the level of accuracy in a detailed energy model as you correctly note. Even still, these detailed energy models are only +/- 10-15% accurate and are not a substitute for the physical testing of built assemblies in-situ; this is the body of experience from which my comment originates.

It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that conductive and convective heat transfer are not the prime modes of heat loss that I‚Äôm referring to. Radiative losses to a black body (the night sky) in a cool region in a window this large will likely be significant. This is why large architectural glazing elements often have heat trace or heating elements directly adjacent to them - they want to keep the interior surfaces warm such that warm humid air from the building does not condense on the interior surface of the glazing when the outdoor temperature drops significantly.

As an experiment, walk in front of a closed window at night on a cold day - you aren‚Äôt touching it (conduction), you aren‚Äôt exchanging heat with air infiltration passing through it (convection), but you will feel colder when you walk past it due to radiative heat loss from you to the cold dark surfaces outside. The inverse of this phenomenon would be walking in front of an open oven when you are 10‚Äô away - you feel radiative heat gain, and no conductive or convective heat (hopefully).",,/r/europe/comments/kycnly/mrizi_i_zanave_albania/gjif5ad/,TripleBanEvasion,1610835273

744,"Few roads in Dacia considering the following:

&gt; Sarmizegetusa, high in the central mountains, was once the capital and sacred center of the Dacians, a civilization crushed by the Roman Emperor Trajan in two bloody wars more than 1,900 years ago. The victory, Roman chroniclers boasted, yielded one of the largest treasures the ancient world had ever known: **half a million pounds of gold and a million pounds of silver**.

&gt; After his victory, Trajan took the spoils to Rome, where they paid for his famous forum. In that same complex, the Roman Senate erected a column dedicated to Trajan and illustrating the story of the wars. Sarmizegetusa was leveled and forgotten for centuries. But stories of Dacia's gold lived on, inspiring generations of peasants who lived nearby to dig in the steep valleys.

 He said the world was unfair when it came to buying vaccines and that little players were always last in the waiting room.

 After receiving many criticisms that the doses of anti-vaccine vaccines, which amount to about 1,000, were too small and only 500 Albanian citizens could be vaccinated with them, Rama replied that this was also commendable, because Albania is second  a country in the region, after Serbia, which starts vaccinating the population.  He emphasized that Macedonia, although it received a promise from Bulgaria that it would donate 100 doses of the first shipment of vaccines that would reach them, and they have not been given yet.

 ""Unfortunately, Macedonia did not start with the vaccination and it is not to blame for that, Bulgaria has not given them the donation yet because they wanted to use it,"" Rama said.

I didn't work anything out, that's literally a fundamental function of Reddit. Is this your first time on the Internet that you need to ""work out"" how it works? Lmao.

&gt;When someone drew a comparison with Germany's actions in the Holocaust you tried to minimise that by whatabouting about the Boer War. 

1. I didn't say anything about the Boer War. Get a grip.

2. They weren't minimising anything, they were just giving other people information that concentration camps were invented by the Brits (which is wrong, although the Brits did use them before the Nazis did).

&gt;That was before I posted on this thread so don't blame me for starting a conversation you were already involved in. 

That was also before I posted in this thread. Are you really having that much trouble reading names?

&gt;Only an 'absolute cunt' would 'whatabout' the Holocaust.

The person who ""whatabouted"" the Holocaust and changed the original topic was the original commenter, ""ScotMcoot"".

If anything, the only person minimising anything was the same ""ScotMoot"", since the Nazis used actual *extermination camps* whereas the concentration camps used by the Chinese are much more comparable to the Japanese concentration camps that were used by the US in WWII. They are not extermination camps but rather camps to imprison people they see as threats to the state.

1010,"You're arguing against a strawman. I'm not defending that we should elect a group of people that would have the power to block whatever content they don't like. And as far as I can tell nobody is. What I'm defending is what already is the case in Germany: we define by law the sort of content that is illegal (essentially hate speech and calling for burning the Reichstag), and leave the courts to enforce it.

I know, very boring, defending the status quo, but I think this law is one of the reasons why Germany remained sane while so many countries descended into madness in the recent years.

The ""CEO decides"" model that you are defending is precisely what has been in place in these countries: UK, US, Italy, Brazil. Your theoretical arguments that it is ideal for fostering free speech are crushed by the reality that it lets propaganda, misinformation, and hate speech fester.

Also, the reality of ""starting your own platform"" seems completely at odds with your rosy view. Even Google tried to create a new platform to compete with Facebook. It failed. Whatsapp managed to create a rival network, by exploring a niche that Facebook wasn't serving. Facebook bought it. The only platforms that enjoyed some level of success were the ones catering to fascists that have been banned from the mainstream ones. And boy, what disgusting hellholes are they!

Also, I find it very bizarre your argument that the Volksverhetzung law is somehow a ""trojan horse"". The law has been in place for *decades*, and I still don't see any negative consequences. This slippery slope is not very slippery, is it?

Let me finish with a quotation from Goebbels:

Yes, I guess it was also fine when Mongols catapulted plagued corpses into Kiev. You can't judge history, right? Come on...

Yes, but SMP was most prominent of them. Therefore I used him as example.

&gt;You cannot compare how slaves were treated in US with how Janissaries was treated, the Janissaries were not slaves once they converted.

Not true. They were seen as ""slave soldiers"". You point out soldiers part, I point out slaves part which you skip. And I compare Balkan kmetovi (serfs) to slaves, not Janissaries, but it was not equalizing it, but comparing it for the context of how wrong your ""they were educated"" standpoint is.

1175,"Nuclear propulsion does have benefits, particularly if you're operating steam catapults like the US Nimitz class and the French CdG. It also allows for sustained high speed operations and frees up space for aviation fuel etc. For the Marine Nationale, who have a weaker replenishment fleet, it mitigates that.

It does have some disadvantages however, it's more expensive and complex to develop, run and decomissioned, requires specially trained engineers and requires specific shoreside infrastructure etc.

For the Royal Navy, there are only two nuclear power capable Naval Bases, Faslane and Devonport, neither of which are suitable for the Queen Elizabeth Class. In addition, the RN has never operated nuclear-powered surface vessels and would need a significant uplift in the number of trained nuclear engineers, not to mention how much this would all cost.

In terms of the ski jump, it allows the STOVL F-35B to take off with a higher fuel and weapon load in a shorter distance, making simultaneous launch and recovery operations possible.

1192,"Fifty years ago on January 16, a young Czech university student named Jan Palach doused himself in petrol and set himself alight at the top of Prague‚Äôs Wenceslas Square. Three days after staging this desperate attempt to rouse a demoralised Czechoslovakia in the face of Soviet occupation, he died in a burns clinic. Though his immediate political goals failed, Jan Palach inspired and steeled the resolve of countless others to fight for freedom during the two decades of ‚ÄòNormalisation‚Äô that followed the crushing of the Prague Spring.

Jan Palach died for that cause in agony, with third degree burns over 85 percent of his body, from head to feet.

In death, Jan Palach would become known as ‚Äúthe conscience of the nation‚Äù, hailed as a martyr of exceptional courage and character.

His death ignited a rash of other self-immolations over the following months: by a student named Jan Zaj√≠c, in Prague; brewery worker Josef Hlavat√Ω, in Pilsen; construction worker Miroslav Malinka, in Brno; and by toolmaker Ev≈æen Plocek, a reform communist, in Jihlava.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/kyi0ou/52_years_ago_jan_palach_set_himself_on_fire_as_a/gjg7ork/,NotAllPedophiles,1610799753

1210,"He's even become the namesake of a new word, the 'Rutte-Doctrine'. 

&gt; **Rutte Doctrine**


&gt; Rutte doctrine refers to the vision of Prime Minister Mark Rutte that internal discussions between civil servants and ministers do not have to be shared with journalists and the House of Representatives. According to Rutte, this is to be able to discuss freely without fear of being looked at on unwise ideas. [1] Critics blame that this contributes to a culture of concealment and deception. [2] [3]

&gt; **Background**


&gt; The doctrine was based on a guideline adopted in 2002 by Minister of the Interior Klaas de Vries. He stated that the personal policy views of civil servants do not fall under the obligation to provide information. The guideline had remained formally unchanged, but according to critics its use had changed, such as the fact that more pieces were omitted for that reason. [1]

&gt; The term first appeared in a text message from an official to Rutte, which was discussed during the interrogation about the benefits affair on November 26, 2020. [4] [5] [6] Incomplete and incorrect information provision, especially from the House of Representatives, ensured that this affair could drag on for years. Due to a critical report on this affair and in particular the provision of information, the Rutte III cabinet resigned on 15 January 2021.

&gt; Since then, the term Rutte doctrine has been used to describe the general actions of Prime Minister Rutte in a number of difficult cases and themes, such as the discussion of the abolition of dividend tax. During Rutte's term of office, MPs were annoyed by the lack of publicity, including Renske Leijten, Farid Azarkan and Pieter Omtzigt who were closely involved with the families duped as a result of the benefits affair. [7] [8]

&gt; In response to the report of the parliamentary interrogation committee on childcare allowance, Rutte promised that the argument of ""personal policy views"" of civil servants will no longer be used as a ground for refusal.

The building were very simple and made from wood... which means they could be ttansferd to another location overnight.

1246,"Well that's why I said 'nor can you expect them to'. 

A 16 year old has little chance to inform themselves. They typical 16 year old focused on school, they've never had a job, they've never felt a direct impact of fiscal policy, or are eligible for being in the military. Think about it: a 16 year old in Austria can essentially vote to send people to war without actually being allowed to participate in said war. 

Now, I would say that 18 is still to young to be honest, but at least you have the chance to have a job. At least you have the independence, the time and the freedom to pursue your interests, to inform yourself on an important decision such as a vote. If they still don't then that's not ideal, but the problem there is another. 

Why do you think a 16 year old would not vote for parties you don't like? Most 16 year olds would likely base their vote relative to their parents: directly against if they're 'rebels', or the same if they aren't really sure.

Why did the Jews accept the 1947 UN Partition Plan, but the Arabs reject it - even though the Arab territories would have been larger than the 1967 lines?

As for the 1967 border that existed before the second attempted destruction of the Israeli state by Arabs, the Arab decision on such a border was unequivocally stated at the 1967 Arab League Submit: no recognition of Israel, and no negotiation with Israel.

At the end of the day, the Arab world lost those borders when they launched a war of conquest against Israel, then got beaten back.

31% Covid deaths in Czechia are people over 85, 92% deaths people over 65, 98% people over 55

those 31% make only like 2% of population, those 98% make up like 30% of population, yet you hear politicians talk about some mass vaccination, 60-70% population targets and other nonsense

they are not clearly interested in saving people at risk, but selling more vaccines and gaining more power limiting people's rights making non vaccinated second class citizens

you can guess what people call me in discussions about vaccination, anyone questioning mass vaccination of healthy population is automatically antivaxxer, same as any person saying anything critical about Israel is automatically anti-semite, it's sad how loud and powerful are simpletons nowadays",,/r/europe/comments/kxttq0/of_people_per_country_willing_to_take_a_vaccine/gjfg76t/,RGBchocolate,1610777157

Rather than caring about that kind of thing, she simply took a lot of meaning from the messages in the Bible, viewing it as a document made by humans and subject to the biases of its time, but still valuable anyway and possessed of wisdom that she found comforting and useful.

For Montenegro, it's more complicated than that. Yes, they more or less preserved independence, albeit with complex and submissive diplomatic ties with OE. 
On top of that, I'm sure you agree that existence of their separate nation was not so distinct then (especially listening to some of your compatriots).

No, I really don't think it would cause a bloody war. Morever Hungarians didn't (nor do they today - hence the natural autonomy) think of Croatia as their own. Another thing would be stripping Hungarians of Transylvania or parts of Slovakia.
So, that kind of division would only strenghten the Monarchy, which was the intention of those (mostly Austrians) who advocated for it.

Maybe the view of the OE is distorted a little because of the need of some antagonizing boogeyman which was needed to be defeated in order to achieve divine independence and to establish firm countries. And certainly the extent of Empire and the number of nations that emerged (again) helped to emphasize the importance of it.
But nevertheless, I certainly can't accept that they were better climate than AH, as far as the Croatian expierence with those two goes.
And I sincerely think that if there hadn't been any of their invasions, there would be more peaceful and simpler relations between our nations.
But I do agree that you know more about everyday life in OE. And I will try to read some more about it in the near future.

And lastly about (re)birth of nations, I don't agree completely. Surely we can't talk about homogeneous nations in the middle ages, but they certainly didn't emerge from nowhere in the 19th century.
Maybe it is social construct, but then it is one that is created through centuries. Sharing the same language, being subjected to the same ruler, being the same religion, fighting for the one guy that bears the name of some province, that all slowly makes one nation.

There is only one year in the last decade when Dutch GDP was over 2.5%. You are a slow growing nation, which is quite interesting given that your population growth is not that bad. 

&gt;It largely is though. Do you even know what macroeconomics means?

Its not, many structural factors are determining the wealth of a nation including its geography. Netherlands position in western Europe, serving as a large port for goods flowing into central and eastern Europe are important. Its also the closeness to industrial centers of Europe where industrialization first began played a big part.

On the other hand its, Government macroeconomic policy restricted Dutch potential with mindless adherence to austerity, small government and deregulation. 

&gt;I think you're just talking out of your ass at this point. Can you at least just give one example?

Fairly simple, the adherence to Washington consensus by the ruling party in spite of  inherent misconceptions around it.

Name calling and blanket statements are unwarranted. Lots of dumb people are just unsure how shit works and not necessarily against the covid vaccine or vaccines in general. In that case for example it would be helpful to have a civilized discussion. I was one of these dumb people.

Because medical drugs are extremely strictly regulated. You might be able to change helper substances in pills (like sugars or colorants), but that's about it. The EMA grants marketing authorization to an active pharmaceutical ingredient across the EU and that means it is the exactly same API across the EU.

In fact, I frequently get re-imported meds from Greece or Bulgaria on my prescription because they are cheaper.

Switzerland refused to side with either the Warsaw Pact or NATO during the Cold War, pledging neutrality. Today, Singapore refuses to be forced to choose to side with either the US or China. 

Singapore is ""allied"" to the West because of converging interests, not because of its political convictions. It isn't a die-hard Western ally as the US or Australia is to the UK. Importantly, Singapore does not have a mutual defence treaty with any foreign power (as Japan and the UK have with the US). The FPDA doesn't explicitly oblige Britain or Australia to come to Singapore or Malaysia's aid, just that they ""consult"" each other. 

Back in 2003, Singapore refused the US designation as a ""major non-NATO ally"" to avoid being drawn into the US camp.

Britain sees a friendly country far away has huge issues with an expansionist Marxist dictatorship with millions in camps and sophisticated spy/disinformation channels and they decide to go and help them. 

EU countries, on the other hand, ignore the millions in camps, the spying operations done by CCP members, the ties between high ranking politicians and Chinese companies and instead focus on trading even MORE with them because, in the eyes of the EU, money is all that matters.  

Everyone paying attention to the situation knows the German economy, the de-facto basis of the EU, is extremely heavily dependant on Chinese money therefore they won't do anything which would put that relation in danger. Not only that but they'll even go ahead and make that relation even deeper which will complicate things even more down the line. By doing so they're digging a grave for Germany/EU which will turn them into nothing more but a puppet to the Chinese market which is controlled by the CCP.

2165,"Text:

One of the arguments made against leaving the EU was that Brexit Britain would have to subordinate everything in its foreign policy to economics and the need for trade deals. But the UK‚Äôs approach to China in recent months shows that this hasn‚Äôt turned out to be the case, as I say in the magazine this week.

On Tuesday, the government ‚Äì in conjunction with Canada ‚Äì announced measures to try and ensure that no products made using the forced labour of Uyghur Muslims end up in UK supply chains. Whitehall fully expects some kind of retaliatory response from China to this ‚Äì just look at how Australia has been treated for saying there needs to be an independent inquiry into the origins of coronavirus ‚Äì but went ahead anyway.

The toughening of the UK‚Äôs position on China is designed to send a message to the incoming administration in Washington: the UK will put principles before profit even at the expense of the inevitable economic retaliation from Beijing. The EU, meanwhile, is still pursuing a David Cameron-style policy of seeking Chinese investment. Look, for instance, at its recent economic treaty with Beijing (a policy which, ironically, Britain encouraged while it was an EU member state). One cabinet minister tells me the EU deal with Beijing, heavily pushed by the Germans during their presidency of the EU Council, ‚Äòshows the EU isn‚Äôt going in the same direction as us on China‚Äô and remarks that it‚Äôll be ‚Äòinteresting to see what the Biden administration thinks about that‚Äô.

Some hawks in government want to go even further. One tells me: ‚ÄòThe big pitch to Biden should be to break the Chinese domination in tech. We need to move these companies out of China.‚Äô Interestingly ‚Äî and in contrast to the Trump administration ‚Äî the primary motivation isn‚Äôt to bring this manufacturing back to the West, but simply to shift it out of China. This will likely require an alternative mass manufacturing hub in Asia.

In the years ahead, Britain will need strong relations with the US, the EU, like-minded powers such as Canada and Australia, and the Asian democracies. Having left the EU, and the protection that being a member of a large bloc affords, the UK has a particular need for the current threats to the liberal rules-based order to be overcome.

Ok so they got deals with 60/70 so far in less than a year that's an accomplishment in my opinion.

&gt;
and until then (assuming it manages it), the UK has, by its own admission, stuck with subpar deals

The uk already has support from a number of countries in the Tpp [like Vietnam ](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade/Vietnam-backs-UK-to-join-TPP-in-Hanoi-talks) and [Japan ](http://moderntokyotimes.com/japan-to-support-the-united-kingdom-joining-the-trans-pacific-partnership/)

I'd also like a link to them saying the deal is sub par

&gt;if you consider impressive making a copy paste of what the EU negotiated, sure. Impressive what a thing even a 5 year old could do is considered exceptional. 

The fact the UK could get the Same deals as the EU without the negotiating power of the EU is indeed impressive.

2278,"I don't know what your experience is, or what Australia is like, but having using public health insurers in Europe for me has proven far more complicated and bureaucratic. In the UK it took me on average 6 weeks to see a specialist. 

Here it took 3. In A&amp;E I had to wait over 6 hours to be seen. In the UK, I never waited that long but I know it's not uncommon. Also I get demands for me to prove my income every year with a paper trail and have to submit paperwork and as someone with their own business, that hurts. 

The difference is that I pay an absurd amount for the public insurer here. It's basically another tax on top of income tax as I really don't have any choice but another public insurer that charges almost exactly the same. It also pisses me off hearing about people getting bullshit unscientific treatments on the public insurer while I shoulder the cost. 

Personally, I miss NHS coverage a lot. I know it's not a pretty system but in my experience is works very well once you're past the triage stage. Waking up at 6am to call the doctor's surgery and get an appointment isn't fun. Being sent to hospital 20 miles from where you live because the closer hospitals are at capacity for what you need sucks. 

I don't think paying something like 4 times as much for my health care results in anything like 4 times as good a service. I pay 4 times as much for a moderately better service that requires legions of paperwork. There's a huge amount of inefficiency in even quasi-private healthcare systems.

The NHS clearly doesn't offer the best service in the world, but the Beveridge model of healthcare is by far the best and the fairest if you ask me.",,/r/europe/comments/kxrwbg/8_reasons_the_uk_leads_europes_coronavirus/gjcez2m/,kingofeggsandwiches,1610720107

A periodic publication that covers current events is by anyone's colloquial definition a newspaper. From Wikipedia:

#2. ""Doesn't look like 'right wing media going crazy'""

It is, by any sane definition, ""going crazy"" for any publication to mention the sexuality of justices, not just in the body, but in fact **the title** of articles--especially when the current event being covered has **absolutely nothing to do with sexuality**. 

To quote the Association of Judges of Ireland:

2. Which can be criticized but is still a lot better than poland, because:
a) Not all members of the Richterwahlausschuss are from the government
b) The 16 members of the Bundestag are elected by all representatives-&gt; they represent ALL parties
c) the 16 justice ministers of the states are also from different parties

What does all of this mean? The government has no overbearing influence on the appointment of judges. (In fact only matters of personal experience and knowledge can be used to determine wether an applicant is fit for duty as a judge by law. Political reasons cannot be considered) Political influence in itself is not a problem.

at first glance it looks like this.  
But we have a much bigger issue here called integration. France want people to not judge based on ethnic/religios/... grounds in these kind of circumstances because otherwise, in time, you risk having paralel societies. Onyone who comes to France must respect this (along with the rest of rules and legislation ofc) or go back home. If France ignores this situation too many times it will only make things worse in the long run. More and more unintegrated imigrants ... broken windows theory ... and then you have segregation, no go zones, riots ... and ultimately, worst case scenario... civil war.

2679,"I can't compare them to other communist parties, but the PvdA in Belgium, and the Belgian public, somewhat evolved towards each other.

First of all, they're less extreme than they used to be. They used to have mixed feelings about clearly extremist communist countries (Venezuela, Cuba, North-Korea, ...). But now they publicly condemn many of the actions taken by those regimes, and refuse people who publicly support those regimes in their party.

But the Belgian political system also has issues. Traditional parties don't get along well enough to form good governments. Government formation takes way too long, and governments fall from time to time. This means people start giving protest votes. Then you can pick between two sides: extreme right or extreme left. Extreme right being racist and nationalist makes extreme left a rather strange, moderate protest vote. In Wallonia, there's even no real extreme right alternative for protest voting, so all protest votes go to the Pvda/PTB.

You also shouldn't underestimate the media. Raoul Hedebouw has appeared in multiple tv shows in the past years. He's a likeable figure, calm and witty, and a very good Belgian compromise: born in Wallonia, with a Flemish name, and perfectly bilingual (his Dutch is even better than my Dutch).

And finally, there's also the achievements of the party.

This has everyone speculating but the consensus is either 22 more Rafale or a squadron of F-35s since Greece will definitely get those too sooner or later. If it is the American fighter, it will replace the venerable F-4 (Greece still operates 30-35 modernized Phantoms with F-18 radars/avionics). The biggest part of the Greek F-16 fleet (about 155 planes, the HAF backbone) is being modernized too. 84 are getting upgraded to F-16V standard, the block 50 will become 50/52+ adv and around 30 leftover Block 30 will be sold or just get retired. The end result will be 122 F-16s, 18 Rafale/25 mirage 2000-5 (or 40 rafale) and 20-24 F-35s, in a setup that mirrors the Israeli Air Force mix (with Rafale playing the F-15 role for HAF).

It's cheaper than California and especially SF for sure, but one result of the digital nomads and expats moving to Portugal, and especially the rise of Airbnb, is the skyrocketing price of apartments and gentrification of places like Lisbon and Porto (sound familiar?). It's still a great value, especially vs SF, but seeing people being displaced so the landlords can Airbnb the places is disheartening to say the least. And while it's still cheap for a foreigner, especially someone from SF, with a remote job and higher income vs what most locals make, it's causing the displacement of locals and all this something to be mindful of.

The language is...interesting...it's more tricky than Spanish, but it helps a lot to know Spanish (and French). Since I know both, it's helped quite a bit when the professor glosses over an explanation or something.

&gt; ¬´The coronavirus will not prove to be particularly dangerous. But the measures against it will have drastic consequences. Probably devastating - a kind of September 11th for humanity. "" The one who writes this is the 66-year-old journalist Christoph Pfluger, editor of ""Zeit"", a two-month magazine ""for intelligent optimists and constructive skeptics"" according to his own definition.
Pfluger, who grew up and lived in Solothurn, dropped out of studies in both medicine and law, was already noticed earlier with his publications on the imbalances in the money economy and the fight against these disparities.

&gt; And now Corona. ""A flu case and the corporations of this world lose billions in value - this is how fragile our highly efficient world is,"" continues the macroeconomic expert Pfluger. And as a medical informant, he calls in the German pulmonologist Wolfgang Wodarg, who has achieved dubious fame with his ""tranquilizers"" against the corona crisis. Pfluger's Elaborat, a pamphlet to be read at times with pinched pleasure, leaves nothing out of criticism of globalization.

2958,"First of all, the article we're discussing has literally nothing to do with Islamic fundamentalism. Just to be sure. Now to the topic you're talking about:

&gt; On the other hand, we have a problem with Islamic extremism and fundamentalism.

Islamic extremism and fundamentalism, yes. And in 1960s-1970s, it was a problem with pro-Soviet regimes in the middle east. You know what does it have in common? Ideology recruits unhappy people. Those who don't see any way from their misery in the established framework, are recruited by those who promise to break the entire framework. Simple as that. Islamic terrorism is real, but it is not the problem, it is a manifestation of the problem. Manifestation that troubles us, but which can't be solved by itself.

&gt; and I really can not see how Macrons remarks were in any way comparable to what Bush said in the early 2000s. 

Because in both cases, it's blatant ignoring (I don't say ""lack of understanding"", because I believe Macron understands the reasons; he just believes it's better to serve public another one) of the underlying problem and pointing to a designated enemy + fueling the superiority feeling. ""They hate us because we're so good and free"". This destroys any possibility of understanding the problems in the general population, why should an average Joe bother, when it's clear that he's being hated because of his positive qualities?

In the long run, his actions are counter-productive. He doesn't offer a path for Muslims, quite contrary, he states that ""you can't be us"" and for the rest, he's pointing fingers at the enemy.

- there was a significant amount of bans during the mass immigration crisis

- the moderators were accused of enforcing leftist censorship by unreasonably moderating away commenters who did not support mass immigration

- you said that this was due to ""racism, white supremacy and nazism"" from the banned users

- in reality in 2015/2016 the moderators of r/europe added a very questionable rule that forced all posters to follow cultural relativism, a far-left idea that does not allow one to make comparisons between cultures or qualitative judgment of a culture

- disagreeing with cultural relativism is not ""racism, white supremacy and nazism"", it's just not subscribing to a specific far-left belief

- since the mods did in fact ban people for disagreeing with far-left ideas and not ""racism, white supremacy and nazism"", it's reasonable to say that at least from 2015/2016 this sub was moderated as a a left wing sub, because far-left ideas were demanded from users in order to be allowed to post here

- since this subreddit is not intended to openly be a far-left only sub, the parts regarding cultural relativism were completely removed from the rules, and today you will find no mention of culture in the rules - logically this implies that the cultural relativism rules were not reasonable to begin with and did not belong in the rules of a politically neutral sub

3094,"&gt;The vast vast majority of people buying a new or used car get a loan over several years.

Which means they can't afford the car. Then everyone can afford anything as long as they have access to some form of credit.

&gt; They don‚Äôt have to buy a car. It‚Äôs a luxury item for those in the cities. 

You are detached from reality if you think this. A car is not a yatch. Try to live in a big city, have kids, and do everything with public transport. Is it possible? Yes. Is it good for your mental health? No.

Also, Oslo is not London, nor are Bergen, Trondheim or Stavanger. They are small cities with lots of low density areas which require plenty of travel time to get around.

&gt; How do you accomplish this? By giving out monetary incentives to purchase a new electric car over an ICE one. 

Subsidised loans are a monetary incentive. It's not like I'm arguing against subsidising EVs. The choice of who benefits is the point I made multiple times.

&gt; This brings me back to why this policy is needed. We need more used EVs on the road for ‚Äúworking class‚Äù people to be able to buy them. The **only** way to do this is get more new ones to be sold. 

Do you really think that in 5 years a working class family will take a loan to buy an Audi e-tron or a Tesla second hand? Look at the figures of sold cars, a good 50% cost more than 40k EUR new, most of the rest cost more than 30k EUR. How cheaper will they be in 5 years?

You want to get EVs on the road for broad adoption? Subsidise loans for small and medium city cars (e-UP, e-golf, Zoe, etc), and exclude expensive ones that won't have much second hand market.

&gt; Don‚Äôt they do this anyways? Also, they‚Äôre fuel is heavily taxed so someone driving a 3L V6 will pay a fortune just running their car. 

It's not heavily taxed, petrol goes for 1.4 EUR/litre, in line with many EU countries.

&gt; But it is!

3126,"3 prime-ministers were changed because they wouldn't dance as Dragnea, the party leader, wanted.

Naturally, that had nothing to do with an instability per se, but with the fact that Dragnea was just trying desperately to avoid jail (for those who don't know: he eventually ended up in jail in 2019). 

IMO the current coalition has no way near similar levels of instability to the Italian one. What I gathered from the day-to-day statements of the leaders of this 3-party-coalition in the past month is that, with minor exceptions, they're actually united. They know what's at stake. 

Plus, no party has any real interest to leave the coalition. USRPlus has received more and better ministerial posts than they could have ever dreamed of, they're there to stay. So is UDMR, which also received exactly what they wanted. PNL might not be too pleased with their lot of ministerial posts, but they're well aware there is no other way but to lead through a coalition. 

Will some MP's jump to PSD in the long run? I don't know, I suspect Orban is well aware of this danger, and as one cunning politician like himself, I imagine he's already done things to at least try to secure the loyalty of the MPs who may tend to switch sides. Orban is very savvy at that.

I believe there are only 3 or 4 MPs that switched from PSD (snatched by Orban himself). So everything hinges not on them leaving, but on actual, older PNL MPs.

And I may now sound a tad too optimistic, but I think this coalition has much higher chances to succeed than CDR.","Romania, Transylvania",/r/europe/comments/kwl8ta/italys_governing_coalition_breaks_apart/gj9k8t1/,ArtDoesNotComeEasy,1610655484

Not really, because I believe the mods, or at least someone on the mod team, are either helping actively or passively. And in the end,  ""this sub"" is still made up of those people too, whether they brigade or not does not really matter.

3408,"&gt; They banned political movement without any proof. Official statement is necessary for them to officially rebuke the statement. Otherwise you are left to guess. You don't think it's dangerous to democracy for social media platforms to ban political movements without any proof of wrongdoing?

Assuming that Twitter is lying about them having several accounts promoting themselves, no. They still have Facebook and Instagram accounts in addition to their own website and as you showed they also receive interviews by major news organisations and that doesn't mention all the other methods they have at their disposal for communication. 

I mean, shouldn't you be fine with their ban since just one comment above your main issue with removals was that they were done on several sites at once. You even said that ""So while with newspapers, there were always alternatives which you could use to present your position, if these companies decide, that wont be the case.""

So what is it? Is it bad when ArticlesOfUnity is censored or is it bad only when something is censored without an option to use another platform?


&gt;It is a completely different issue. Forums on reddit are a small scale topic conversations. They are design to be just that. Communication on social media platforms is without any concrete topic. They are design to be just general communication about anything, to connect you with everyone. And they have essential monopoly on such conversation, there are no real alternatives for politicians. If you don't see the difference, I don't know what to tell you.

You mean something like a free section on newspapers where you can post what your mind desires but they aren't required to host all of it?

3422,"That's not true. Excess seats go to the party with the most ""reststemmen"" (remaining votes).

There's two methods. For smaller local governments (=&lt; 18 seats total) it gets divided by who has the most remaining votes. Say you need 1000 votes for one seat (the kiesdeler), and there's 3 seats up for grabs. One party gets 1500 votes, the other 1800. Both get one seat. The remaining votes then are 500 and 800. The party with 800 remaining votes gets the third seat.

For bigger local governments and national government, its a bit more complicated and there's a bit more maths. They take all the votes a party had and divide it by the amount of regular seats they get +1. So say the kiesdeler is 1000 again. There's 45 seats to de divided. Party 1 has 16700 votes. Party 2 has 15900. Party 3 has 12400. They get 16, 15, and 12 regular seats. For remaining seats, party 1 has an average of 16700/(16+1)=982. Party 2, 15900/(15+1)=993. Party 3, 12400/(12+1)=954.

Party 2 has the largest average so they get seat 44. The averages then get recalculated: party 1 still has 982, party 3 still has 955, and party 2 now has 15900/(16+1)=935. Party 1 gets seat 45.

Parties used to be able to make ""list connections"" that would add their remaining votes in one heap, so they'd get a higher average and have a higher chance of picking up a remaining seat. This was especially common among smaller parties, I believe the CU and SGP pretty much always did it at a national level. But this was scrapped a few years back, the big parties didn't like the smaller parties being able to ""steal"" their seats.

3458,"It‚Äôs not exactly an official position here either, yet, but it‚Äôs acknowledged by the workforce and the health ministry is aware that‚Äôs how it works. 

I agree with you for the most part, it‚Äôs basically a bandaid for a deep open wound that‚Äôs almost infected. Hospitals appreciate the abundant and cheap workforce as it helps deal with high waiting times in urgency care and they don‚Äôt have to care too much about their professionals, as they are starting to become relatively easy to replace. 

It doesn‚Äôt solve our chronic problem with high waiting times for specialised care consultations or for surgeries, nor does it help solve the lack of primary care practitioners. If it‚Äôs not something that will kill you if not addressed soon, expect to wait anywhere between 6 months and 2 years for a first observation. And that‚Äôs with doctors having 2-3 people per time slot scheduled for most high-need specialties (which leads to its own set of problems - less time per patient, delays, etc).

The only solution would be to open up more spots for specialisation, but without having the needed resources for that, that would mean lowering the quality of our specialists.

Very slowly and in a controlled environment, where you potentially could affect the process to get a better outcome.

You are not burning this instead of other fuel, you just extract this fuel first to make this trash and then you burn it putting it back into atmosphere. What is left can be partly reused and partly has to be stored in a landfill anyways.

The entire idea is probably just most money efficient. I would not be surprised if they would be first payed for burning the thrash and then payed for the energy obtained and whatever useful material stays.

Scottish fishing has been plunged into crisis, as lorry-loads of live seafood and some fish destined for shops and restaurants in France, Spain and other countries have been rejected because they are taking too long to arrive.

The industry‚Äôs biggest logistics provider, DFDS, a Danish company, pointed to delays regarding health certificates, issues with the IT system interface between the group and local authorities, and incorrect or missing customs documentation from customers.

New Brexit rules require every box of seafood and fish to be offloaded from lorries and inspected by vets before it leaves Scotland. It has taken business owners five hours per lorry to obtain a health certificate, which is required to apply for other customs paperwork.

3998,"TL;DR at the bottom

Oh, it's a good way to keep territory, but it requires either decades or centuries (in the case of Gibraltar, the latter) of keeping the territory happy and protected. This being successful is underpinned by the principles of self-governance post-WWII. Even if Gibraltar being taken and slowly (or quickly, I don't know) becoming British goes against those principles, it happened over three centuries ago, long before we really put into place a status quo of disallowing expansion by conquest and what not. To ""undo"" this wrong would require doing another wrong.

Consider a larger example: the US. Or Canada, which I see you either live in or came from, based on your flair. Or Australia. Or western Poland (formerly largely German). Or any other number of places. While Gibraltar is very small and the forced return of it may be ""small"" in terms of the ""evil"" or ""wrong"" that it is, many areas also are currently populated by a non-native population, one which replaced the previous population at some point (Poland's west being something that happened just 70 or so years ago, while the majority of the Americas had colonization starting 500 years ago and extending to probably as late as a century to 150 years ago in the US). When it comes down to, Gibraltar is an older conquest and colonization project (assuming colonization was intentional) than pretty much all of the US.

Unfortunately, the wrongs of the past are in the past. There isn't an easy way to just undo them. Depending on the issue, there may be a feasible remedy, but in the case of ""this area was colonized"", it's hard to deal with in a just manner. Even Israel, as much as I think they have, to varying degrees, Apartheid-like policies, and as much I think the attempt to create a Jewish state in an Arab location was a terrible idea that should never have been undertaken, I don't think just dissolving Israel is the right solution. Some of the settlements in the West Bank, perhaps, since they are relatively new and thus don't have the same roots. However,  overall, I don't think an attempt to just ""fix"" an issue by returning a territory to its former owner when the population has been replaced for decades or centuries is an actual fix, and certainly not the best one.

TL;DR: It *is* the ""best"" way to acquire and keep territory because it's not the right way. It creates a situation where returning the territory runs counter to the principles that the post-WWII world order and peace is built on. If you can create roots, then the territory is beyond recovery because the principles barring that also bar undoing it (at least quickly). And also unfortunately, Gibraltar is merely the smallest of such examples of it happening. The answer is to stop such ""roots"" from forming in the first place, a chance that has long past for Gibraltar and many other regions.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/knsizu/spain_and_uk_reach_deal_to_place_gibraltar_in_eus/gj6oi5i/,ptWolv022,1610590936

&gt; By making Cartel i mean different companies acting together to regulate their sector as if they had the monopoly, and this is what they did in this case, we all agree that a single company banning Trump was a good thing, the problem is when all those companies act together and decide that no one should let him speak.

That's only a problem if there was no actual reason.

Imagine a criminal traveling to multiple countries, then concluding that all those countries must be acting like a cartel because all of their police forces are after that criminal.

&gt;But i'm not talking about Trump specifically, because they even had good reasons to do so, the problem is that in general they have enough power to do so.

Yeah, but there's only been a single case of this happening - and it happened to a man that tried to commit a coup.

He didn't just incite a mob to go storm congress. We're now finding out that panic buttons were stripped out from democratic congress people's rooms prior to the coup attempt.

There were terrorists live tweeting Pelosi's location.

The capitol police did less than nothing to deal with a large group like this.

This was a coup attempt. Of course the people involved should be banned from every fucking platform out there.

If this was people being banned from all these platforms for no, or minor, reason then I would agree with you.

But that requires evidence, or at least requires us to prove it's even happening.

&gt;Those are not platforms, they are Editors and as Editors they are regulated (at least here in Europe), while twitter and facebook are free to act as they please without being subjected to any obligation. That's what we are discussing.

The platforms have editors, but they are still platforms.

Facebook and Twitter also have moderators &amp; admins that manage what content is allowed. Both platforms have ToS that result in people being banned and posts being deleted every day - they just made an exception for Trump because he was president (and popular)

The point here is pretty simple: Do politicians have multiple avenues to communicate with the people they represent?

Do they have a right to use a specific private companies platform? No of course not, the idea is fucking insane.

Imagine if they passed a law that stated that any politician was allowed to use your house as a base of operation, even though you don't consent - how fucking insane is that?",,/r/europe/comments/kvn6nm/no_longer_acceptable_for_platforms_to_take_key/gj6rngr/,upvotesthenrages,1610592615

4085,"Every time a company in Bulgaria does business with a Eurozone country (and Germany is our largest trading partner), they also have to cover currency exchange fees. By adopting the Euro, this burden will be removed from businesses.

Secondly, being a Eurozone member allows for cheaper borrowing. Since loans are backed by the whole Eurozone, investors are more willing to lend money at lower rates to smaller countries. This is one of the things that good Greece in trouble, but if managed properly it can be a huge plus for the country‚Äôs economy.

Also, tourism is a big % of Bulgaria‚Äôs economy so if tourists don‚Äôt have to waste money exchanging currency, that‚Äôs a big plus too.

Finally, having your own currency allows the central bank adjust interest rates and devalue the currency if needed. This is something that can boost the economy, especially in times of crisis.

So why don't they balance it themselves so that they know for sure that the EU will not come in and ""permanently destroy their economy""?

&gt; The Greeks put themselves into a terrible position. The EU simply made it impossible for them to ever escape it. You will not find any mainstream economist that is not on the bankroll of northern European governments who will disagree with this.

I actually do agree that what happened to Greece was partly German and Dutch banks getting bailed out by the EU through the bank account of Greece, which indeed was a bad thing. That being said, I really do not see what is wrong with an institution like the ESM pressuring a country with a huge deficit to make some painful but necessary reforms for a sustainable budget.

Ireland also received financial support, and a lot of [other EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/financial-assistance-eu/which-eu-countries-have-received-assistance_en) as well.

&gt; To take a gamble on the EU managing Italy given what has happened before is like playing Russian roulette with 5 loaded barrels.

You keep on pretending the situation is one where you either choose for a crazy irresponsible gamble and the other one is safe and will definitely not lead to huge trouble.

&gt; If someone was proposing that your country went through a process that in the past had only ever led to consequences far worse than the Great Depression, would you be willing to risk it?

As you can see from the only publicly available [data](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2932661-1), the UK cohort, the only that received LS/SD, topped at 55yo and both arms that received the more efficacious regimen had less than 1500 people and very few positive cases. I'd rather have a properly evaluated vaccine as the last thing we need is vaccine resistant variants which are much more likely to arise if you have poor efficacy/protection. Furthermore, if people who are vaccinated are not protected at an acceptable level it will decrease vaccine compliance and damage the vaccination program. Given the UK has a very unethical and irresponsible press, the danger of poor compliance and anti vaccine movements is more accentuated and should be taken into consideration.

The Ramming was purely caused by Turks trying to bullyy the Greek and cut the Greek ships route which ended up in half-ramming. And these incidents even occur between Russian and American but the problem is Rammer ship in general takes less damage. But in this case, The Greek frigate returned to Dockyard unlike the Turkish one. And no, Turkish ships did not leave the Aegen or Mediterranean, and the navy was there to assist the Sysmic research ships in case of any threat. But after realizing there was not threat to Sysmic Research ships, The navy stopped assisting thhe ship and still exploiting the Aegen and Mediterranean. It was not because of the small greek army or navy. And from the very begining Turkey was asking Greece to talk these matter on table. All the bluffs of Greece such as cutting the cables or sinking ships were pointless, and had no backbone. Just recently Turkey announced new Navtex. Even the sanctions in EU summit were on indiciduals not to Turkey as a state, which also proves that the allience is just a joke. And now Turkey joined a program with UK to build its own jets. And US sanctioned Turkey purely because S400 not because She facors Greece. So in general Greece is just a proxy for France but even in EU summit France lowered her tone for sanctions. Only EU state that can control Turkey is Germany which was proven back in 2020. Once Merkel asked wannabe sultan to pull his navy back, he pulled the navy back.

Same thing with the media, we have anti disinformation laws, but we leave them a lot of slack to the point the media can pretty much say anything unless literally everyone agrees something is wrong. So, neither of those two sets of laws are effective.

On the other hand the US has the first amendment which is essentially incompatible with hate speech laws.

I don't know if it is possible at all to have laws that effectively fight fascism without collaterally maiming important aspects of society. As such I believe that the fight should be done in the education and civism fronts. In my country we have civism classes (mandatory for kids 10-15), religion-related classes are optional (and most of what is done there is about planning field trips to unrelated places) and the school programs are decided by the central government based on what the field experts believe that is relevant and factual. As such teachers are not allowed to teach eg. history classes impartially (this is particularly hard given that Portugal was once upon a time one of the world biggest empires) or creationism as a fact. We're also very multi-cultural which means that everybody got a chance to deal with immigrants and can tell that they're essentially the same as we are and that bad apples exist everywhere.

Now, this is much harder to map to the US given that the country is enormous, states have extraordinary powers and Alamama can freely decide to teach creationism, present Mexicans as unwanted job stealers, birth-prevention as anti-jesus and so on. I honestly don't have a clue, but those are the problems you must tackle to fight fascism since everything depends on education and social interaction.",Somewhere south of Lisbon,/r/europe/comments/kvyjik/heres_why_europeans_dont_like_techs_trump_ban/gj4wr43/,claudio-at-reddit,1610561135

&gt;Setting up cell towers requires permits, digging, cable laying, insulating, measuring, etc. This might sound easier and cheaper than launching thousands of satellites but you have to do these procedures every time you want to put another one up. So it'll be very slow. Especially if you don't have electricity at the place that you're trying to put a cell tower.

Same thing with supplying this service. You can't just start it and have people use it. You need the licenses, the frequencies, the infrastructure on the ground still to forward the signal. Seems also a bit strange to have companies like Amazon and Starlink push local competitors out of the market with subsidized options (because no way this stuff is profitable soon).

They tried to get the most extreme amount of particles from their single test vehicle and then compared it to the **particulate** portion of the exhaust (particulates in the exhaust are mainly soot) to get the scary scary stupid number of:

4669,"Why is it a strawman? Pleas elaborate because I genuinely don't see how. I argue that the government is forcing something, not promoting it in a comment that pointed out that it was not a market adaption of EVs, but an invasive manoeuvre by governments by reducing taxation heavily on EVs. There is nothing more to it. You obviously read it way differently?

I believe it's a terrible thing that the government influences decisions, if it's not a viable or better option. EVs are currently not a better option, but may be a cheaper option for people due to lower taxation. If you take a look at the EVs sold in Norway, it's only in congested areas, where possibilities of charging stations are high. In rural Norway, no one would ever dream of relying on EVs.

EVs have major issues with brakes, batteries and in general electricity issues in cold regions. You can find this information online quite easily to learn why it's not really a good alternative right now, but with the governement forcing EVs to become cheaper than Petrol, Diesel and even Hybrids, people see no option but to transition, as they fear a ban is going to come on existing vehicles and there is no guarantee EV pricing is going to stay low forever, there will most definitely be taxation once the majority are using EVs.",,/r/europe/comments/kwcn4e/electric_vehicles_outsold_petrol_diesel_hybrids/gj3s1o0/,TokiToki1500,1610539369

Yes, but in effect there is an opportunity cost for the government. Assuming you sustain current budget, this income has to come from somewhere.

If a southern country, let's say Portugal, makes EV tax exempt, than they are loosing revenue. What the individual is saving in VAT the collective is loosing in VAT revenue. And since people buying \[new\] cars are the richer part of the population, it in effect creates a situation where the rest are financing, or at least are loosing on, for the sake of the richest.

It may be great in astonishingly wealthy Norway, but that's absolutely an outlier. By most metrics Portugal is a rich, first-world, country with a temperate climate; yet more people die there to cold that in the vast majority of the EU.

Im sorry? What the fuck you on about? Iceland isnt a part of Sweden nor Scandinavia. The Faroe Islands are owned by Denmark but are autonomous and not a part of Scandinavia either. 

&gt;And they are lying

Couldnt say but they are severely lacking data for sure and they only test by roads.

Just look at [Tre](https://www.tre.se/privat/varfor-3/Vart-nat/tackningskartan/) cover 98,9% of Sweden so at least calls and messages can be sent and received according PTS (Swedens Post and Telecom Authority) [Here's](https://www.tre.se/privat/kundservice/tackning/tackningskartan/) a more extensive map and then there's Tele2. [Here's](https://www.tele2.se/tackning-nat/tackningskarta) their coverage map and you can select between 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G and how the good coverage is. [Here's](https://www.telia.se/privat/support/tackningskartor) Telias coverage map but if I remember correctly they use the same telecom thing as Tele2 actually but again the coverage is essentially everywhere in Sweden where people actually live and of course it covers large parts of our entire forrest so you can walk about and use ""Allemansr√§tten"" and not worry about not having service in the forrest. 

Average 4G speed is usually around 30mbit/s to 70mbit/s depending on your carrier. I usually get around 70-80mbit on 4G most of the time, so starlink would be slower. Just imagine 5G then that at the moment exist in most larger cities although the 5G auction just ended so they can run that real fast 5G now. It'll take some time to expand the 5G coverage but it'll be faster and cheaper to do because well you dont have to launch a bunch of shit into orbit or some how maintain that, I dont think it'd be competitive cost wise against already established carriers in Sweden.",Konungariket Sverige,/r/europe/comments/kwcncl/eu_must_move_at_speed_on_space_broadband_network/gj3sg5f/,weirdowerdo,1610539728

4750,"&gt; I didn't say false translation, I'm saying translation is an imperfect process, as imperfect as you want it to be.

Right.  So let's stop with the equivocation and be clear.

1. Are you claiming that an intentionally-misleading English mistranslation was provided?  Yes or no?  If yes, what actual support do you have for this?

2. If you are making this claim, how can you justify it in the face of the commitments made also being valid in Ukrainian?

&gt;Ukraine believed that signing this meant they would be protected territoriality and politically.

All right, there are two sources there, #5 and #6.  Let's look at them.

First source.  Contains 19 references to Ukraine.  None of them involve such a commitment.

Second source.  It's not saying that the US or UK broke the agreement.  It's saying that the agreement was worthless.  Yes -- *because Russia broke her commitments in the Memorandum*.

&gt;If you're the strongest in the world, and you're watching someone strong beat up someone weak you aren't being neutral by not stepping in, you're siding with the aggressor.

Okay, so let me get this straight.  Your assertion is that the United States -- not sure how your this has anything to do with assigning guilt to the UK, since I think that it's safe to say that the US is the largest military power today, guess we can come to that later -- holds guilt equivalent to the the stronger party in conflicts around the world if it does not attack that stronger party in response?

4992,"&gt; See how important these regulations are?

No, all you did was take massive tax subsidized sectors, literally all of them are classified as utilities, and compare that to a private communications/advertising company.

&gt;Have an electrical grid where you don't want to serve people that are unionized? 

That's a suuuuper heavily tax subsidized utility. Hence why we regulate it.

&gt;Have a Phone mast that does not serve people that are not nazies?

Same as the above

&gt;Have a marketplace that only allows members of a certain political party?

That's totally fine. Go to any other marketplace.

I mean, conservatives have *literally* just fought over this exact issue. They fought, tooth and nail, for the rights of a private business to not serve gay people.

What's the difference between denying service to a gay couple, only because they are gay, and denying someone a service because they are a member of a party?

If it's a tax funded company, a monopoly, or a government entity, then I can kind of see your point - but these are private companies, none of which are monopolies for communication

And even if it were a government agency there should still be limitations. In my opinion, a Nazi, fascist, communist (not socialist, very different) or confederate should never be allowed to work in any government agency. These are all enemy ideologies that hundreds of thousands of people have died fighting - they are literally the opposite of freedom and the values that any free democratic nation strives for.",,/r/europe/comments/kvn6nm/no_longer_acceptable_for_platforms_to_take_key/gj36x1o/,upvotesthenrages,1610519045

Anyway, the point being discussed is if american prisons can be compared to slave labor/concentration camps.. In some states yes, it is actually slave labor, for example Texas who pays 0$/h, they are forced to work and are paid nothing, this is the definition of slave labor. 

Ironically enough the economy of U.S. prison system wouldn't work without forced labor. However the problem runs much deeper at the core and this forced prison labor becomes fundamental to the development of the prison economy complex. 

The rich investors owning companies related to prisons make money when the prisons expand due to need of more equipment, this leads to lobbyism and resources invested into politics which promotes unjust penalities for small crimes (such as 20y for minor marijuana possession etc.) and unjust laws. In the end this system is only possible due to the prisoners maintaining themselves through forced labor and that actually promotes further expansion. So the issue is profiteering of prisoners, and I highly doubt this is the case in most if not all western democracies (except U.S.).",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/kw0cz0/graph_of_atlantic_slave_trade_contributors/gj37fi0/,borggren4,1610519464

If you're trying to create an Ebola vaccine, that's difficult because it's unlikely you're going to get a statistical certainty your vaccine works between the vaccinated and placebo group because the incidence of Ebola in the general population is very rare.

Comparably, running a trial on COVID vaccines easily gives statistical certainty because of the sheer number of infections. If you get 100 infected people in the placebo group and 0 infected people in the vaccine group, you can be pretty certain your vaccine works. 

This is part of the reason the Oxford vaccine had to start a new trial in Brazil. In the summer COVID rates were low in the UK so they feared this would not give enough statistical certainty between the vaccinated/placebo groups.

In many ways this was the perfect storm for a quick vaccine. Lots of infectious people, massive trials with loads of money, and a blank chequebook.

I have 2 iron balls i use them to punish sinners, they are good for nothing else, if you can impress me with a trick using these 2 balls I'll let you out of hell.

The Devil tells them they have til tomorrow and vanishes laughing.

The men lament their fate trying to come up with tricks using 2 iron heavy balls that are good for nothing.

The Devil 1st appears to the Russian. He goes on to show the Devil he can juggle the 2 iron balls while singing Katyusha and dancing Kozachok. The Devil laughs at the Russian telling him he looked ridiculous and repeated the trick with ease condemning the Russian to hell for eternity.

The Devil next appears for the German. The German takes the 2 iron balls throws the at walls opposite of each other, they bounce back colliding in mid air &amp; falling to the ground landing side by side. ""Nice"" proclaims the devil while stroking his goatee but then adds ""you Germans always think you're the best but you over complicate things without reason"". The Devil then repeats the trick condemning the German to hell for eternity.

Next the Devil appears for the Pole. Bewildered the Devil finds the Pole crying in his cell..

As for other countries and equivalence, they have requested this, been able to provide something EU want in form of a deal, and probably agreed by this deal to align certain regulations to the EU. Said deal is also likely governed by the ECJ in case of deal infractions. 

Tell me, were UK offered such terms? Yes.

Did UK accept such terms? No.

So if no equivalence through a deal and alignment are given, and there is border checks and controls, why shouldn't the UK be treated like any other 3rd party country after the transition period ended?

Turkey is even more happy to postpone it, you just said that there are drillings, besides it's Greece that have to wait for exploitation half of the sea territory it believes it's entitled to, given to the conditions it seems like Greece is almost sure that it will lose it's case in ICJ. Current government is irrelevant like I said before the disputes started in the 50s.

Demilitarization is not a complex issue, and yes there are treaties about it, treaties which Greece outright ignores. Some Turkish politician talking about in Turkish parliment about 2 of the islands in the north is not argument:
1-it doesn't explain about countless militarized islands, islets and rocks in rest of the Aegean that should not be according to Lausanne.
2-Even if that statement is true(source was too deep to check) it holds no legal meaning. Given to the your source is misinforming about Cyprus and Aegean airzone completely I would take it with a grain of salt.
If there is no legal consequences Greece should gladly go to the ICJ. A respectable country should follow the treaties it signed in the past. This not anywhere in Greece, there is a serious legal dispute about military state of those islands, and territorial water and airzone(Greece claims 10m airzone for those islands, it's the only country in the world that claims more airzone than territorial waters it has).

Economic benefits doesn't matter, it should be agreed bilaterally and through law. Project power to who? I don't think anyone is impressed by a bunch of drilling ships.

It's literally in the linked article. Has the US moved further east than I remember?

&gt;In 1865, the United States passed the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which banned slavery and involuntary servitude ""except as punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted"",[32] providing a legal basis for slavery to continue in the country.[33] As of 2018, many prisoners in the US perform work. In Texas, Georgia, Alabama and Arkansas, prisoners are not paid at all for their work.[34] In other states, as of 2011, prisoners were paid between $0.23 and $1.15 per hour.[35] Federal Prison Industries paid inmates an average of $0.90 per hour in 2017.[33] In many cases the penal work is forced, with prisoners being punished by solitary confinement if they refuse to work.[36][37] From 2010 to 2015[38] and again in 2016[39] and in 2018,[40] some prisoners in the US refused to work, protesting for better pay, better conditions, and for the end of forced labor. Strike leaders are currently punished with indefinite solitary confinement.[41][42] Forced prison labor occurs in both public/government-run prisons and private prisons. The prison labor industry makes over $1 billion USD per year selling products that inmates make, while inmates are paid very little or nothing in return.[33] In California, 2,500 incarcerated workers are fighting wildfires for only $1 per hour through the CDCR's Conservation Camp Program, which saves the state as much as $100 million a year.[43]",,/r/europe/comments/kw0cz0/graph_of_atlantic_slave_trade_contributors/gj24tv9/,Imoraswut,1610496686

You seem really fixed on your current political situation in Germany. I'll go back to my original point: both left socialism (""regular socialism"") and right socialism (""national socialism"") have killed millions of people in the past. Both have hatred toward certain people. Right socialists focus on race and nationality. Left socialists tend to be more intelligent, so they have more elaborate reason why they want to kill someone. Morally, both are absolutely equivalent. Millions have died from the same ideology (socialism), be it left or right. Some have been intentionally killed. Some have been left to die. If you think ""regular"" socialism is any better than national socialism, you are trying to make a distinction without a difference.

I am out. I am tired of explaining the same things over to you. You have no clue what you are talking about. You think ""right is bad"" and ""left is good"", thus ""real"" socialism is not bad, because it's left. You are a wrong. Just study history that's not just Nazi Germany.

5471,"You're failing to understand the key part of that - we're talking about 'free-speech' and Governments essentially describing what is free-speech and as such when Twitter can and can't remove content.  


If one country classes something as free-speech and another country say Twitter has to remove it, or is legally allowed to remove it as it doesn't constitute free-speech, who does Twitter follow? Well to be legally compliant it follows both, which means they'd block people from country a from seeing content from people who are from country b as the law surrounding their content is different.  


This isn't about companies being above democratically elected governments, this is about politicians who are mad because they aren't allowed to do whatever the want on private platforms, they are literally complaining because they themselves don't get to control what constitutes free-speech, it's shameful.",,/r/europe/comments/kvn6nm/no_longer_acceptable_for_platforms_to_take_key/gj19wfu/,BenJ308,1610481915

Many stories were broken by reading Trump tweets, and Trump did not give many press conferences compared to previous presidents. 4chan is incredibly fringe, not only because of how few people visit it compared with Facebook or Twitter, but also because it is anonymized, which gives it a much lower impact (compare how significant you find it if your uncle Joes writes on Facebook what he votes in an election, compared to if some random anonymous onliner does the same on reddit or 4chan) and because the people who frequent it generally are outcasts and people living on the fringe of society in various ways (see the documentary ""tfw no gf"" for instance). 
I am not claiming that companies like Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Apple or Reddit are in a cartel in the sense that they have had meetings and collectively decided to ban Donald Trump and certain conspiracy theorizing political groups who follow him, only that they have acted like a unified force. This may have other explanations however, for instance that their leaders and workers share similar political sentiments or that they react to a common pressure from the democrats now controlling both the presidency and both of your parliamentary chambers (when standing in an elevator, people naturally disperse, so nobody stands too close to each other, this is not something they have verbally agreed upon, yet it is not a coincidence - this is another example of a nonrandom pattern giving a specific result without people having spoken to each other).

5684,"&gt; Yeah, but people supporting the communism ideology don't support the starvings or the massacres


To think communism as some sort of peaceful ideology is simply  misinformed.  Communism has always, starting with Marx himself, *openly* been rooted in the idea that ""things can only be changed through violent revolution and forcible overthrow"" of whatever government/class they do not like. Even in Italy communist movements post WWII talked about ""the proletariat revolution"" and you had even the Brigate Rosse, a communist terrorist organization.

They might not intend starvation, but starvation is the byproduct of an ideology so dysfunctional that leads to massive poverty and starvation. 


&gt; Those parties in Italy aren't properly fascist only because it's illegal to proclamate themselves as such. If that wasn't the case nowadays we would have big neofascist parties in the parliament.

Italy does have ""proper"" neo fascist movements like CasaPound who speak openly of their ideology and they do not have that much support.  and they did participate to the elections, although they did not get many votes (less than 1 %).

Show me the German referendum on Bulgaria/Romania's EU accession. 
It's not how EU accession has ever worked. Germany for the past 6 months of its EU rotating presidency was trying to ram Albania and N Macedonia into EU accession, without any care of current public opinion, but just because of geopolitics...

And you are showing **current** public opinion of - ""Should Turkey be in the EU"" . I am surprised it is not 100% against, as the current state of Turkey can't possibly be in the EU.

20 years of EU alignment, reforms and most importantly end of demagoguery in Turkey will make a huge difference for this number.

&gt;We've already allowed countries in the EU, that drifted into semi-authoritarian behavior after they joined. Becoming an EU Member State is in no way a certainty that they will actually become a democratic society living under the rule of law.

This is on us and we are taking steps to remedy this huge EU issue, obviously countries at risk won't be allowed to join until we create the means necessary to keep states democratic and destroy demagoguery.",Europa,/r/europe/comments/kvqu25/turkey_is_determined_to_press_ahead_on_eu_reforms/gj0f1fl/,dothrakipls,1610467891

So basically regensburg actually has a ton of bars, but also has a little statistical trick up its sleeves with all the students to fudge the numbers a bit. You could stay ""top 5 for bar-thickness"" and you'll be correct enough.

5824,"Wait what are you talking about? We are not talking about common law crimes. This is a completely unrelated subject. It's like if I would suddenly start talking about the UN Law of the Sea. This has nothing to do with the topic of discussion.

We are talking specifically about the use of English Law in the US Supreme Court. For which there are many examples. Just consider this:[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf)

&gt;William Blackstone, for example, wrote that Catholics convicted of not attending service in the Church of England suffered certain penalties, one of which was that they were not permitted to ‚Äúkeep arms in their houses.‚Äù 4 Commentaries on the Laws of England 55 (1769) (hereinafter Blackstone); see also 1 W. &amp; M., c. 15, ¬ß4, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 422 (1689) (‚Äú\[N\]o Papist . . . shall or may have or keep in his House . . . any Arms . . . ‚Äù); 1 Hawkins, Treatise on the Pleas of the Crown 26 (1771) (similar).  
&gt;  
&gt;By the time of the founding, the right to have arms had become fundamental for English subjects. See Malcolm 122‚Äì134. Blackstone, whose works, we have said, ‚Äúconstituted the preeminent authority on English law for the founding generation,‚Äù Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 715 (1999), cited the arms provision of the Bill of Rights as one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen. See 1 Blackstone 136, 139‚Äì140 (1765).  
&gt;  
&gt;As Sutherland explains, the key 18th-century English case on the effect of preambles, Copeman v. Gallant, 1 P. Wms. 314, 24 Eng. Rep. 404 (1716), stated that ‚Äúthe preamble could not be used to restrict the effect of the words of the purview.‚Äù J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction, 47.04 (N. Singer ed. 5th ed. 1992). This rule was modified in England in an 1826 case to give more importance to the preamble, but in America ‚Äúthe settled principle of law is that the preamble cannot control the enacting part of the statute in cases where the enacting part is expressed in clear, unambiguous terms.‚Äù Ibid.  
&gt;  
&gt;Between the Restoration and the Glorious Revolution, the Stuart Kings Charles II and James II succeeded in using select militias loyal to them to suppress political dissidents, in part by disarming their opponents. See J. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms 31‚Äì53 (1994) (hereinafter Malcolm); L. Schwoerer, The Declaration of Rights, 1689, p. 76 (1981). Under the auspices of the 1671 Game Act, for example, the Catholic James II had ordered general disarmaments of regions home to his Protestant enemies. See Malcolm 103‚Äì106. These experiences caused Englishmen to be extremely wary of concentrated military forces run by the state and to be jealous of their arms. They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the Declaration of Right (which was codified as the English Bill of Rights), that Protestants would never be disarmed: ‚ÄúThat the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.‚Äù

With the court referring to English Law so much your statement that ""What they did in the UK in the 1700s or after has no bearing on current American law,"" is simply not true. It has SOME bearing.

5903,"&gt;American courts want nothing to do with determining acceptable content on social media platforms. 

They do that already though. As you yourself have very well explained: Courts intervene when there is actual illegal content on the plattform. Courts going a step further and requiring companies to let someone onto the platform is a difference in degree not in kind. 

&gt;Most Americans think getting kicked off social media and fired form your job is an acceptable punishment for hate speech, but getting arrested isn't.

Are there polls on this matter? Or how is the opinion of most Americans determined here.

&gt;I have never heard of this in the US.

The doctrine of obligation to contract has always been linked to the American concept of common carriers. See Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 113 (1876):

&gt;When the people of the United Colonies separated from Great Britain, they changed the form, but not the substance, of their government. They retained for the purposes of government all the powers of the British Parliament, and through their State constitutions, or other forms of social compact, undertook to give practical effect to such as they deemed necessary for the common good and the security of life and property. All the powers which they retained they committed to their respective States, unless in express terms or by implication reserved to themselves. Subsequently, when it was found necessary to establish a national government for national purposes, a part of the powers of the States and of the people of the States was granted to the United States and the people of the United States. This grant operated as a further limitation upon the powers of the States, so that now the governments of the States possess all the powers of the Parliament of England, except such as have been delegated to the United States or reserved by the people. The reservations by the people are shown in the prohibitions of the constitutions.  
&gt;  
&gt;When one becomes a member of society, he necessarily parts with some rights or privileges which, as an individual not affected by his relations to others, he might retain. 'A body politic,' as aptly defined in the preamble of the Constitution of Massachusetts, 'is a social compact by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good.' This does not confer power upon the whole people to control rights which are purely and exclusively private, Thorpe v. R. &amp; B. Railroad Co., 27 Vt. 143; but it does authorize the establishment of laws requiring each citizen to so conduct himself, and so use his own property, as not unnecessarily to injure another. This is the very essence of government, and has found expression in the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas. From this source come the police powers, which, as was said by Mr. Chief Justice Taney in the License Cases, 5 How. 583, 'are nothing more or less than the powers of government inherent in every sovereignty, . . . that is to say, . . . the power to govern men and things.' Under these powers the government regulates the conduct of its citizens one towards another, and the manner in which each shall use his own property, when such regulation becomes necessary for the public good. In their exercise it has been customary in England from time immemorial, and in this country from its first colonization, to regulate ferries, common carriers, hackmen, bakers, millers, wharfingers, innkeepers, &amp;c., and in so doing to fix a maximum of charge to be made for services rendered, accommodations furnished, and articles sold. To this day, statutes are to be found in many of the States some or all these subjects; and we think it has never yet been successfully contended that such legislation came within any of the constitutional prohibitions against interference with private property. With the Fifth Amendment in force, Congress, in 1820, conferred power upon the city of Washington 'to regulate . . . the rates of wharfage at private wharves, . . . the sweeping of chimneys, and to fix the rates of fees therefor, . . . and the weight and quality of bread,' 3 Stat. 587, sect. 7; and, in 1848, 'to make all necessary regulations respecting hackney carriages and the rates of fare of the same, and the rates of hauling by cartmen, wagoners, carmen, and draymen, and the rates of commission of auctioneers,' 9 id. 224, sect. 2.  
&gt;  
&gt;From this it is apparent that, down to the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it was not supposed that statutes regulating the use, or even the price of the use, of private property necessarily deprived an owner of his property without due process of law. Under some circumstances they may, but not under all. The amendment does not change the law in this particular: it simply prevents the States from doing that which will operate as such a deprivation.  
&gt;  
&gt;This brings us to inquire as to the principles upon which this power of regulation rests, in order that we may determine what is within and what without its operative effect. Looking, then, to the common law, from whence came the right which the Constitution protects, we find that when private property is 'affected with a public interest, it ceases to be juris privati only.' This was said by Lord Chief Justice Hale more than two hundred years ago, in his treatise De Portibus Maris, 1 Harg. Law Tracts, 78, and has been accepted without objection as an essential element in the law of property ever since. Property does become clothed with a public interest when used in a manner to make it of public consequence, and affect the community at large. When, therefore, one devotes his property to a use in which the public has an interest, he, in effect, grants to the public an interest in that use, and must submit to be controlled by the public for the common good, to the extent of the interest he has thus created. He may withdraw his grant by discontinuing the use; but, so long as he maintains the use, he must submit to the control.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;And the same has been held as to warehouses and warehousemen. In Aldnutt v. Inglis, 12 East, 527, decided in 1810, it appeared that the London Dock Company had built warehouses in which wines were taken in store at such rates of charge as the company and the owners might agree upon. Afterwards the company obtained authority, under the general warehousing act, to receive wines from importers before the duties upon the importation were paid; and the question was, whether they could charge arbitrary rates for such storage, or must be content with a reasonable compensation. Upon this point Lord Ellenborough said (p. 537): 'There is no doubt that the general principle is favored, both in law and justice, that every man may fix what price he pleases upon his own property, or the use of it; but if for a particular purpose the public have a right to resort to his premises and make use of them, and he have a monopoly in them for that purpose, if he will take the benefit of that monopoly, he must, as an equivalent, perform the duty attached to it on reasonable terms. The question then is, whether, circumstanced as this company is, by the combination of the warehousing act with the act by which they were originally constituted, and with the actually existing state of things in the port of London, whereby they alone have the warehousing of these wines, they be not, according to the doctrine of Lord Hale, obliged to limit themselves to a reasonable compensation for such warehousing. And, according to him, whenever the accident of time casts upon a party the benefit of having a legal monopoly of landing goods in a public port, as where he is the owner of the only wharf authorized to receive goods which happens to be built in a port newly erected, he is confined to take reasonable compensation only for the use of the wharf.'  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Common carriers exercise a sort of public office, and have duties to perform in which the public is interested. New Jersey Nav. Co. v. Merchants' Bank, 6 How. 382. Their business is, therefore, 'affected with a public interest,' within the meaning of the doctrine which Lord Hale has so forcibly stated.  
&gt;  
&gt;But we need not go further. Enough has already been said to show that, when private property is devoted to a public use, it is subject to public regulation. It remains only to ascertain whether the warehouses of these plaintiffs in error, and the business which is carried on there, come within the operation of this principle.
