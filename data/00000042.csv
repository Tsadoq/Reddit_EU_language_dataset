46,"&gt; Question, is there any reason why AZ promised hundreds of millions vaccines?

Probably because in a best case scenario with a 100% yield from the first batch that's what they'd be able to deliver.

Out of the UK's first 40-million vaccines supposed to be delivered in Q4 2020 they only got 4 million (4% of what was 'promised').

A lot was learned from that UK rollout so the EU will be getting 50% of its initial order to be delivered in Q1 2021. That's a 10x better first yield than the UK managed and is a huge improvement.

...this is a *good* thing, yet the EU still wants to shit all over the company for it.

In a normal world, if this happens, it‚Äôs a scramble: first party to lay their hands on the goods, wins. Let‚Äôs say a farmer sells 50 tons of wheat to one party and 50 to another, but his harvest is only 80. He informs EU that he can only deliver 30, because UK has a prior contract for 50. Eu then goes to court and demands forced execution. A bailiff goes to the farm and takes 50. But now UK is upset, because he cant get 50. 

Contracts are not opposable to parties that weren‚Äôt part of the contract. So it becomes a race to who can go to court/lay their hands on the goods before the other. The last one in line either gets goods, their value in money, or the farmer is declared bankrupt.

104,"Not quite. From the contract:

&gt;WHEREAS, as part of that scale-up, AstraZeneca has committed to use its Best Reasonable Efforts (as defined below) to build capacity to manufacture 300 million Doses of the Vaccine, at no profit and no loss to AstraZeneca, at the total cost currently estimated to be Euros for distribution within the EU ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†I (the ""Initial Europe Doses""), with an option for the Commission, acting on behalf of the Participating Member States, to order an additional 100 million Doses (the ""Optional Doses"").

That says nothing of where the doses will be produced. It just says that AZ will give best reasonable effort to build capacity to manufacture 300M doses for EU distribution with an option by the commission to increase that by another 100M doses.

Translation: We will do our best reasonable efforts to build out capacity required to supply your orders. To me, and most interpretations I've read by various lawyers, ""reasonable efforts"" would certainly take into account other existing contracts and commitments by AZ.

As to the part in the ""Schedule"" section, which I assume you mean ""Schedule A"", there is nothing that says ""guaranteed"" or something equivalent. In fact, the title table of the table where the delivery numbers seem to be contained (I can't be sure because it is redacted) literally says ""Estimated Delivery Schedule.""

So looks to me like AZ promised to give their best reasonable effort to build out capacity to supply the EU doses. They provided an estimated schedule. Their best reasonable effort to build out capacity to supply EU doses wasn't enough.

I speak Spanish but not Galego, is it unreasonable to expect me to use Spanish names for the beach?

"" Until then, it seems a very unhealthy position, where one language has all on its favor and the other is maintained as a second-level language"" Stop with the victimization, the decision to use Castellano as the country wide language was taken long ago and really helps with integrating the country. Or would you prefer that everyone is forced to learn how to speak each regional language? Good luck learning Euskara while living in Andalucia. Good luck having 10 different language lessons on school. Galego is not a ""second-level"" language in the sense that it is discriminated or looked down upon, it is just a much less disseminated language and as such doesn't make sense to require that the whole country learns it and speaks it.

Well AZ tells us it can't use the two British plants referenced in its EU contract because the UK gets everything from there first...

[Which is why it's worth fuck all](https://yarn.co/yarn-clip/fe0fda24-08e6-4ad4-a0e0-19e75bc09346).

I'm not saying the UK government is (primarily) at fault here. It's AZ's fuck-up to sign two contracts that contradict each other. Also the EU did fuck up its vaccine procurement strategy. These two facts don't exclude each other.

US sources were all US funded from the start and so is all the additional capacity we created via federal emergency funds.

The walls are low and backed by lots of earth so that it's resistant to cannonfire. The angles are designed so that every wall can be covered by raking fire (shots that go alongside the wall, so that they provide maximum amount of firepower against anyone trying to storm the wall).

Those cannons are in a perfect position to shoot alongside the entire wall. And since the corners end in points and not rounded ends there is no position along that entire side that provides cover from those guns (there would be a similar position covering the other flank of the corner bastion). The guns themselves are pretty well protected since they're tucked into a small protected corner (from outside fire, but it would be suicide for an enemy to try to take that platform). And behind you are even more guns that enjoy the same field of fire (and protection). And ammo (and your route of escape) is provided by that small doorway behind you. That doorway itself would be protected by murderholes (small firingports in the walls and ceiling) and similar nasty surprises further in, if anyone managed to breach it.",,/r/europe/comments/l992o2/kuressaare_castle_estonia/glkkqfy/,fiendishrabbit,1612161096

468,"&gt;unless all it takes for a language to be distinct is political posturing

Ding ding ding, we've got a winner. Welcome to the world of languages.

First of all, are Norwegian and Swedish different languages? Speakers of both languages can talk to each other just fine speaking their respective languages. Are Czech and Slovak different languages? Or Croatian, Bosnian and Serbian? Same principle applies.

Second of all, where do you draw the line between one language and another? How can it be, that a norwegian speaker close to the swedish border can understand a swede close to the norwegian border better than he understands a norwegian that lives hundreds of kilometres away from him? They speak the same language, right? Whereas the swedish guy speaks a different one, namely swedish.

I can imagine that, especially seeing how germany has succesfully killed many of their local languages in favour for standard german already, the austro-bavarian spoken in germany is a very watered down version that's probably closer to standard german than it is to anything else.

495,"&gt;Yes but the EU is not demanding that Pfizer vaccines produced in the US are diverted to the EU to make up the shortfall.

The Pfizer vaccine being produced in the US not being shared when there was not enough produced was very much negatively commented about. But the situation was basically known for month and done under the Trump administration and it is obviously pointless to complain to the Trump administration.

More imprtantly Pfizer did agree to deliver the agreed upon doses for the first quarter, the agreement was about quarterly numbers so if they compensate the reduction of deliveries in the same quarter there is not really a problem.

It is just a bad move because of the vaccination schedule.

&gt;That is what they were doing in the case of the AZ vaccine produced in the UK.

Well, AZ did say that they would reduce the deliveries for the whole quarter and since the agreement was about quarterly numbers it makes sense that this is a different matter. They also came out with obviously wrong statements when they were asked to explain their shortfall. 

They said that the reason for the delay was the longer negotiation with the EU, which was obviously wrong, that the UK production was totally separate from the EU production, which was wrong and they said that there were no binding numbers which was wrong.",Berlin (Germany),/r/europe/comments/l8ht2t/eu_astrazeneca_megathread/gljyfzq/,MartinS82,1612148068

So you think they screwed up by putting the wrong letter, by not adding a space marking it as a set, by mislabeling the branch to Swedish with a ""no"", and by having branches that make no sense in the first place since both languages widely use both √Ñ and √ñ?

I've already told you, the ""√§√§"" is 100% intentional. The reason for ""√§√§"" is because Finnish utilizes double vowels to denote long vowels, while Swedish doesn't. This means ""√§√§"" is a lot more common in Finnish than Swedish. But it's a poor selector as the letter sequence ""√§√§"" does appear in Swedish too, it can found in compound words and informal words like [*n√§√§*](https://svenska.se/saol/?id=2093810&amp;pz=7).

Great, since 24 million doses per quarter would not make a measurable dent in a 40 million requirement if split, and since it's such an insignificant amount not worth arguing over, then let's split them.

&gt;Further, the UK have contributed massive amounts of money (¬£12 bln across all the vaccine initatives) [towards research, manuacturing, and rollout.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/covid-vaccines-to-cost-u-k-almost-16-billion-watchdog-says). It's estimated that this [is 7x more per capita than the EU](https://www.ft.com/content/c9bbc753-97fb-493a-bbb6-dd97a7c4b807). This is not the UK somehow solely benefiting from the EU cash, the UK have contributed massive amounts to this.

I wholly appreciate UK put money towards the vaccines in general, and also into AstraZeneca in particular. But UK contribution towards the AstraZeneca vaccines at the heart of this controversy has not been exclusive. Yet it is receiving 100% of its order and 100% of UK plant output where the EU is forced to take exclusive cuts to its orders. This does not seem equitable to me. But it is the illogical gloating of UK posters that really gets me. ""Well we invested earlier, so you're clearly idiots expecting that your contractual, paid for obligations are going to be met, also you don't deserve any deliveries if you're such huge idiots.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And why isn't this an issue? They push Article 16 before releasing what a massive fuck up it is. Do you hoenstly not see a single problem with the EU procurement process?

The issue is: you can not have both, gloating over untouchable supply, and simultaneously horror at someone else protecting their supply. You can't insist to keep 100% of the production on basis of nationalism and UK national rights and contractual priority in spite of other contractual obligations, then simultaneously be outraged at some universal humanistic principle being broken when EU looks out for its own by also demanding its own contracts are fulfilled first, before others' are. This is the reddit reactions I am talking about.

Criticism of Article 16 being triggered is a different thing, and also very silly, but I don't care to get into details of something that no longer matters.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The UK is itself involved with the BioNTech supply chain with supply [of lipids for the vaccine production](https://www.cityam.com/british-chemicals-firm-strikes-100m-deal-with-pfizer-to-produce-covid-vaccine/). The UK isn't hoarding anything, they are using as many vaccines as their own manufacturing output can produce. Introducing export controls will end up incredibly messy, espically if others retaliate.

UK is currently keeping 100% of vaccine output created in the UK despite contractual obligations of suppliers to provide for the EU. This is what I call hoarding.

In an unrelated story, export controls apply to ready made vaccines from suppliers that aren't meeting their contractual obligations inside the EU. This doesn't matter to UK lipids or German vials or what have you. As a matter of fact, this isn't impacting Pfizer supply into the UK either.

684,"The UK shortfall hasn't even been mentioned even though it was 30M for last September. Even the current total isn't close to that (and it includes other vaccines other than AZ). 

I think the UK politicians have been advised to stay quiet on that front especially since this was framed by the EU as a legal matter. The normally vocal Boris has been tight-lipped and even Article 16 only resulted in a 'grave concerns', rather playing the victim for Ireland.  So I think the UK government are trying to diffuse. They're also probably worried export controls will be enforced. You can sometimes win points when someone messes up by helping them rather than pointing out their mistakes.

Confronting politicians with mistakes they've made rarely results in anything other than anger and counter accusations anyway. Article 16 was a mistake (no apology), ordering vaccines 1/4 year later than others, was mistake (no responsibility). 

Realising you have to wait on the vaccine... start criticising the vaccine. Most of it is distraction and politicians doing a bad job trying to reapportion blame.

750,"Yeah. Also, until a relatively recent official standard update Scottish Gaelic [actually used ones slanting both ways](https://gaelicgrammar.org/~gaelic/mediawiki/index.php/Orthography#Vowels), a bit like French.   So older Scottish Gaelic text with both left-slanting and right-slanting marks exists, but Irish never had any left-slanting ones and recent Scottish Gaelic has no right-slanting ones - at least if not written by someone who disagrees with the relevant standard.  So it's also a little more reliable to ask regarding the left-slanting ones  (as this chart does)  than the right-slanting ones to distinguish the two.

I think (not an expert alarm) that starting to use the two different vowel accents was a small innovation by the Scottish some centuries back in the first place, perhaps actually genuinely influenced by French via the [Auld Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auld_Alliance) for all I know. I believe they were all right-slanting further back in the common ancestor to both modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic, as that ancestor had just adopted the right-slanting Latin [Apex mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_\(diacritic\)) along with the rest of the Latin alphabet from the then-nearby Romans.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/l9d8sv/what_european_language_am_i_reading_a_flow_chart/gliilav/,DGolden,1612123523

Someone said Liz Truss has done a ""fantastic job"" in ensuring the existing deals were rolled over, but I mean it was never going to be an issue. It wasn't exactly hard won wins. We have good relations with other countries, we all want to do trade with each other, it would have been a massive surprise and a big issue for diplomatic relations if other countries sought to punish the UK.

We're paying an American company Pfizer for some vaccines at $20 a dose - and we paid in advance in June 2020, months before the EU concluded a contract with them.

And the Oxford vaccine comes from British plants, which we helped develop.

The EU needs to ask itself why it is trying to grab vaccines that other people developed and paid for.

Pfizer took no money to develop their vaccine, they used shareholder funds. And the Oxford vaccine was developed at cost by the UK as a gift to the world.

I think it would be great if the whole world was vaccinated before the EU.

931,"Have you read the [welt.de interview with the AZ CEO]( https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article225095715/Astra-Zeneca-CEO-I-do-believe-we-treated-Europe-fairly.html) on this topic? Obviously it's from a biased source but I do feel it presents quite a different picture to the one advanced by the Commission. For example,

&gt;&gt;**Question**: You said that the UK signed the Astra Zeneca vaccine contract three months before EU, so you had more time to tweak and fix the potential disruptions of the supply. Why did you commit to similar contracts with the EU, if you knew that in a very short time there could be problems like the one the EU supply chain is experiencing right now?

&gt;**Answer**: First of all, we have different plants and they have different yields and different productivity. One of the plants with the highest yield is in the UK because it started earlier. It also had its own issues, but we solved all, it has a good productivity, but it‚Äôs the UK plant because it started earlier.

&gt;Anyway, we didn‚Äôt commit with the EU, by the way. It‚Äôs not a commitment we have to Europe: it‚Äôs a best effort, we said we are going to make our best effort. The reason why we said that is because Europe at the time wanted to be supplied more or less at the same time as the UK, even though the contract was signed three months later. So we said, ""Ok, we‚Äôre going to do our best, we‚Äôre going to try, but we cannot commit contractually because we are three months behind UK"". We knew it was a super stretch goal and we know it‚Äôs a big issue, this pandemic. But our contract is not a contractual commitment. It‚Äôs a best effort. Basically, we said we‚Äôre going to try our best, but we can‚Äôt guarantee we‚Äôre going to succeed.

Secondly, the pre-existing contract is a benefit to the EU. The UK's order allowed AZ to kickstart production in the EU. Without that order, the EU's production would be even further behind. In other words, AZ's pre-existing commitments is actually helping AZ to deliver on its obligations.

The control of exports (which isn't a ban) set up by the EU is only a means to stop vaccine producers to breach their contracts further, because there is fear that they'd prioritize countries that paid more, because the EU pays a lot less than most thanks to their bargaining power.",Brussels,/r/europe/comments/l8ht2t/eu_astrazeneca_megathread/glgu7y8/,Pampamiro,1612087496
1244,"&gt; Another important point is that, under Section 5.4 and Schedule A of the EU contract, UK manufacturing sites are specifically mentioned to be used for production of the vaccine.

You're missing a few key points. Schedule A is an *estimate*. An estimate is not binding. 

5.5 says:

&gt;  AstraZeneca shall notify the Commission as soon as (a) it selects initial manufacturing sites and (b) it changes any of its manufacturing sites for the Vaccine.

This notification of the final selection of the manufacturing sites has not been published.

&gt; many are assuming that 5.1 and 5.4 are mutually exclusive

Yes they are. 5.4 is deliberately worded so as to exclude it from 5.1. The IEDs must be made in the EU.

All these lawyers say AZ is correct and the EU is wrong, and that doses do not need to be supplied from the UK:

Firstly, AZ is only obligated by 5.1 to use EU facilities for the Initial Europe Doses. Since it's currently producing those IEDs, it is under no obligation to use UK facilities. Therefore, its pre-existing commitment to the UK to use UK facilities does not prevent it from fulfilling its obligation to use EU facilities to produce for the EU.

Secondly, the pre-existing contract is a benefit to the EU. The UK's order allowed AZ to kickstart production in the EU. Without that order, the EU's production would be even further behind. In other words, AZ's pre-existing commitments is actually helping AZ to deliver on its obligations.

Even if AZ was in breach of 13.1(e), it gives the EU no power to demand UK vaccines. It simply means AZ is in breach and the EU can sue for damages.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/l8ht2t/eu_astrazeneca_megathread/glgua5x/,00DEADBEEF,1612087558

No totally unrelated!! The EU has taken no further action, and made no further mention, of attempting to obtain doses produced in the UK. They know they're wrong. They know they can't. They've shut up about it.

&gt; In section 5.4 it is stated that the best effort clause applies to UK and EU factories

5.4 says the inclusion of the UK is for the purposes of 5.4 only. It does not override 5.4. 5.4 is basically a section that deals with where production is allowed to take place, not where it must take place. This is because the EU wants to grant permission for AZ to produce in non-EU countries, but for the purposes of the contract the UK is defined as being part of the EU, presumably because it has an idental framework of laws and standards to the EU, so it would make no sense to waste time approving it.

Nonetheless however, because of this, the Soviets had no other recourse than to try and deal with Germany and bide time. 

It wasn't the Soviet union that allowed Germany to start WW2, they were the ones trying to prevent it. Your info is conveniant surface level information to paint a narative, but it falls flat when considerring more of the context at the time.

No doubt the Soviets were an imperial force that wanted to make the world communist and happily took over as many countries as they could.. but their goal was a political/ideological shift, to achieve it, they were willing to commit classicide, just like the western powers in the cold war.

If that happened the UK government would immediately put up export controls exactly the same way that EU has already done.

As I said there is now no goodwill in the UK for the EU over these vaccines.

Think about it. Oxford university in the UK developed the vaccine and then a partner was found to produce a vaccine to be sold at no profit for the benefit of everyone. The UK behaved incredibly well through this period.

What did the EU do?

They took too long negotiating a contract for something that is sold at cost.

They provided money to upgrade a vaccine factory in Belgium. This was started much later than the ones in the UK because they wasted so much time.

They wrongly claimed that vaccines were being diverted from the EU to the UK.

They sent inspectors to the plant to double down on their claim.

They claimed that the contract said EU should get vaccines first because the they thought AZ would not let them publicly show it. They were wrong.

They raised legislation to threaten the rest of the world with vaccine exports.

They broke the Good Friday Agreement blocking trade between EU and Northern Ireland. This is less than a month after the EU had spent many years negotiating that the border must be open and that there must be a sea border in the UK.

Ursula VDL cheated in her University thesis. In her mind because she cheats then the whole world must cheat. The UK is not the bad guy here.

If you have an MEP I suggest you write to them and recommend that the current commission is desolved and a new one is formed.

What the EU should have done is to go to AZ and ask them what they can do to help them get the manufacturing process running efficiently.

1362,"Text of Article as follows:

 LONDON  ‚Äî Edwin Vermulst, a trade lawyer in Brussels, did not think twice  before he agreed to write an article for Huawei, the Chinese  telecommunications giant, that would criticize a Belgian policy that  threatened to box the company out of lucrative contracts. He had worked  with the company for years.

After the [article](https://itdaily.be/blogs/infrastructuur/belgische-uitrol-5g-op-kruispunt-van-regelgeving-en-protectionisme/)  was published Dec. 17 on a Dutch-language website, he moved on to other  work. ‚ÄúThat was the beginning and end of my involvement,‚Äù he said.

Little  did he know that the article would take on a life of its own. It soon  became part of a covert pro-Huawei influence campaign in Belgium about  5G networks, the high-speed wireless technology at the center of a  geopolitical dispute between the United States and China.

First,  at least 14 Twitter accounts posing as telecommunications experts,  writers and academics shared articles by Mr. Vermulst and many others  attacking draft Belgium legislation that would limit ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù vendors  like Huawei from building the country‚Äôs 5G system, according to  Graphika, a research firm that studies misinformation and fake social  media accounts. The pro-Huawei accounts used computer-generated profile  pictures, a telltale sign of inauthentic activity.

Next,  Huawei officials retweeted the fake accounts, giving the articles even  wider reach to policymakers, journalists and business leaders. Kevin  Liu, Huawei‚Äôs president for public affairs and communications in Western  Europe, who has a verified Twitter account with 1.1 million followers,  shared 60 posts from the fake accounts over three weeks in December,  according to Graphika. Huawei‚Äôs official account in Europe, with more  than five million followers, did so 47 times.

 The effort suggests a new twist in social media manipulation, said Ben Nimmo, a [Graphika investigator](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/09/technology/ben-nimmo-disinformation-russian-bots.html)  who helped identify the pro-Huawei campaign. Tactics once used mainly  for government objectives ‚Äî like Russia‚Äôs interference in the 2016  American presidential election ‚Äî are being adapted to achieve corporate  goals. 

 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs  business rather than politics,‚Äù Mr. Nimmo said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not one country  targeting another country. It looks like an operation to promote a major  multinational‚Äôs interests ‚Äî and to do it against a European state.‚Äù

Graphika,  which provided research for the Senate Intelligence Committee‚Äôs  investigation of Russian disinformation, said there was not enough  evidence to identify who was behind the pro-Huawei operation.

Huawei  said in a statement that it had started an internal investigation ‚Äúto  try to find out what exactly has happened and if there has been any  inappropriate behavior.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúHuawei has clear social media policies  based on international best practice, and we take any suggestion that  they have not been followed very seriously,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúSome  social media and online activity has been brought to our attention  suggesting we may have fallen short of these policies and of our wider  Huawei values of openness, honesty and transparency.‚Äù

Twitter said it had removed the fake accounts after Graphika alerted it to the campaign on Dec. 30.

‚ÄúPlatform  manipulation is strictly prohibited under the Twitter rules,‚Äù the  company said in a statement. ‚ÄúIf and when we have clear evidence, we  will take action on accounts associated with this practice, which may  include permanent suspension.‚Äù

 Huawei,  the crown jewel of China‚Äôs technology industry, has suffered from a  sustained American campaign to keep its equipment from being used in new  5G networks around the world. The Trump administration said the company  posed a national security threat, arguing that the Chinese government  could use Huawei‚Äôs communications technology for spying. Huawei has  strenuously denied those accusations.

The Trump administration took several steps to hobble Huawei, including an effort to cut off its [supply of critical semiconductors](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/17/technology/trump-huawei-commerce-chips.html) ‚Äî policies that the Biden administration hasn‚Äôt committed itself to retaining. Britain announced a [ban of Huawei](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/huawei-uk-5g.html) products last year; Germany and other European countries are debating restrictions of their own.

The 5G contracts are expected to be worth billions of dollars.

Belgium,  home to the headquarters of the European Union and the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization, illustrates the risk Huawei faces across Europe,  the [company‚Äôs biggest market outside China.](https://www.huawei.com/uk/annual-report/2019)  Until now, Huawei and the Chinese company ZTE had dominated Belgium‚Äôs  telecommunications-equipment market, according to Strand Consult, a  research firm. But as the Belgian government considers new restrictions,  wireless operators in the country are shifting 5G deals to rival  companies.

‚ÄúThey  fear this could spread to other parts of the world,‚Äù said John Strand,  the founder of Strand Consult, which works with many wireless companies.

Mr.  Nimmo said the pro-Huawei effort in Belgium had been clumsily executed  and easy to identify. But it shows, he said, how underhanded internet  campaigns try to launder seemingly legitimate material like Mr.  Vermulst‚Äôs article through a mesh of websites and fake social media  accounts to give it an air of impartiality and authenticity.

Graphika  discovered the pro-Huawei effort after spotting suspicious posts about  Belgium‚Äôs 5G policy from Twitter accounts used in an [earlier pro-China operation](https://graphika.com/reports/spamouflage-dragon-goes-to-america/). The Belgian magazine [Knack](https://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/fake-influencers-en-fake-news-moddercampagne-van-huawei-tegen-de-belgische-regering/article-longread-1680851.html?cookie_check=1608829670) and [Michiel van Hulten](https://twitter.com/mvanhulten/status/1341376781039915008), director of Transparency International in Brussels, also identified suspicious efforts to spread pro-Huawei information.

The  14 fake accounts amplified by Huawei officials spread positive articles  about the company and negative views of Belgium‚Äôs 5G policy. The  three-week campaign appeared to be tied to a Dec. 30 deadline in Belgium  to review the country‚Äôs 5G policy.

 To  the casual Twitter user, the fake accounts looked legitimate. They  included bland profile pictures along with career information. Many had  more than 1,000 followers.

But on  closer inspection, investigators identified problems with the accounts.  Many of their followers appeared to be bots. And the pictures had the  hallmarks of being created by artificial intelligence software, with  perfectly centered photos but small imperfections, like asymmetrical  glasses. Online businesses sell these kinds of photos of [fake people](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/21/science/artificial-intelligence-fake-people-faces.html), which can avoid the risk of detection that using pictures of real individuals can bring.

The  fake accounts shared articles and commentary from different online  publications, including EU Reporter, which publishes government news to  its own website and affiliates like London Globe and New York Globe.",,/r/europe/comments/l982mo/inside_a_prohuawei_influence_campaign/glgnopd/,AntiTankieAction,1612081242
1363,"‚ÄúIf  the Belgium government excludes specific suppliers, who will pay for  it?‚Äù read the headline of one news story published on different EU  Reporter websites.

Colin Stevens, the  publisher of EU Reporter, said in an email that he had ‚Äúno knowledge of  any fake Twitter accounts promoting our articles.‚Äù Mr. Stevens said that  Huawei had paid EU Reporter to publish opinion articles in the past,  but that those were always labeled with disclaimers. The Belgian 5G  stories were independently assigned without Huawei involvement, he said.

‚ÄúEU Reporter would never knowingly be part of a disinformation campaign,‚Äù Mr. Stevens said.

In  a few instances, investigators found articles like Mr. Vermulst‚Äôs,  which Huawei paid for and included disclaimers about the financial  arrangement. Other articles critical of the 5G policy appeared on  websites that accept user-generated content without review, alongside  author pictures that were the same as the computer-generated images in  the fake Twitter profiles.

Phil  Howard, the director of the Oxford Internet Institute, said operations  like this would become more common as disinformation became increasingly  commercialized. In a [recent report](https://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/posts/industrialized-disinformation/),  Oxford University researchers identified 63 instances in which public  relations firms were involved in online disinformation operations in  2020. The work is typically on behalf of political figures or  governments, he said, but can be applied to businesses.

‚ÄúThe  flow of money is increasingly there,‚Äù Mr. Howard said. ‚ÄúLarge-scale  social media influence operations are now part of the communications  tool kit for any large global corporation.‚Äù

In  Belgium, the campaign appeared to have little effect beyond drawing  unwanted attention to Huawei‚Äôs lobbying efforts. Policymakers have shown  no signs of backing away from plans to limit Huawei‚Äôs access to the 5G  networks. The draft legislation must now be considered by the country‚Äôs  Parliament.

Mr.  Vermulst, the trade lawyer, said he hadn‚Äôt known about the fake social  media campaign until being contacted for this article. And while he  called the effort ‚Äúsilly‚Äù and ‚Äústupid,‚Äù he hoped to continue working for  Huawei.

‚ÄúLawyers get paid for legal  opinions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOnce that article is in the public domain, anybody  can do with it what they want.‚Äù",,/r/europe/comments/l982mo/inside_a_prohuawei_influence_campaign/glgnoy9/,AntiTankieAction,1612081248

1445,"The EU have been pushing that narrative, the media are just reporting it.

After AstraZeneca announced they would not be able to hit their Q1 vaccine production targets, the EU's Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides raised the prospect of vaccines being exported at the expense of the EU ""The European Union wants to know exactly which doses have been produced by AstraZeneca and where exactly so far and if or to whom they have been delivered"" and announced ""In the future, all companies producing vaccines against COVID-19 in the EU will have to provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries [like the UK]"": https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_211

She was supported in this by the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/26/eu-means-business-covid-vaccine-exports-ursula-von-der-leyen

Stella Kyriakides would then refute AstraZeneca's claim that they couldn't use vaccine production sites in the UK for supply to the EU until those sites had supplied the earlier UK contract: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/27/eu-covid-vaccine-row-astrazeneca-european-commission

This is probably the moment it truly shifted to an EU vs UK narrative.

German MEP Peter Liese directly criticised the UK for importing the Pfizer vaccine from the EU and warned of a trade war: https://www.euronews.com/2021/01/27/astrazeneca-row-could-spark-an-eu-uk-vaccine-trade-war-warns-mep

French President Emmanuel Macron was critical of the UK's vaccine strategy in a recent interview with the Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/29/emmanuel-macron-coronavirus-vaccine-exports-eu-controlled) amongst other baseless and pointlessly incendiary soundbites (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jan/30/half-friends-is-not-a-concept-uk-should-decide-who-its-allies-are-says-macron).

Germany's vaccine committee recommended AstraZeneca's vaccine was not used for over-65's, despite its widespread use for that age group in the UK: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/health-pharma/german-vaccine-committee-recommends-no-astrazeneca-jab-for-over-65s-1.4470114

On Friday the EU introduced export control measures for vaccines and it was a surprise to nobody that the UK was not on the list of countries exempt from these measures: https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-imposes-export-controls-on-rich-nations-from-saturday/

It all culminated in the EU briefly triggering Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol as part of the export controls, to the condemnation of pretty much everyone and at the risk of raising tensions over the most complex and controversial aspect of the Brexit deal: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/30/eus-vaccine-blunder-reopens-brexit-battle-over-irish-border

Hopefully the cancellation of the trigger on Article 16 and the reported 'reset' between the UK and EU will calm down the hysteria: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55876176",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/l8ht2t/eu_astrazeneca_megathread/glgfw5o/,RomanticFaceTech,1612074783

1453,"The Borromean Islands (It. Isole Borromee) are a group of three small islands and two islets in the Italian part of Lago Maggiore, located in the western arm of the lake, between Verbania to the north and Stresa to the south. Together totalling just 50 acres (20 hectares) in area, they are a major local tourist attraction for their picturesque setting.

Their name derives from the Borromeo family, which started acquiring them in the early 16th century (Isola Madre) and still owns the majority of them (Isola Madre, Bella, San Giovanni) today.

* **Isola Bella**, named for Isabella, countess Borromeo, was originally a largely barren rock; after first improvements and buildings, opened by count Carlo III between 1629 and 1652, his son Vitaliano the 6th built an attractive summer palace, bringing in vast quantities of soil in order to build up a system of ten terraces for the garden. The unfinished building displays paintings by Lombard artists and Flemish tapestries.
* **Isola Madre**, the largest of the three, is also noted for its gardens, which have been maintained since about 1823 in an English style. Its palace, though uninhabited, is splendidly furnished with 16th- to 19th-century Italian masterpieces and paintings.
* **Isola dei Pescatori** or **Isola Superiore** is now the only inhabited island in the archipelago. It has a fishing village, which in 1971 had a population of 208, now \~ 50.
* **Isolino di San Giovanni** is located just off Pallanza (today part of Verbania) to the north.
* The tiny uninhabited rock of **Malghera**, with an area of only 200 square meters, lies between Isola Bella and Isola dei Pescatori and offers bushy vegetation and a small beach.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/l96lt6/isole_borromee_lago_maggiore_italy/glggj3y/,filosoful,1612075258

1490,"Located along the Western boundary of the ‚ÄúCantabrian rasa‚Äù along Spain‚Äôs Galician coast is a stretch of sand just under a mile long, yet packed with a most unusual series of geological formations. This beach alone proves that Mother Nature had a fondness for flying buttresses eons before any human engineer patted himself on the back for coming up with the now-iconic architectural feature. 

Officially called the Praia de Augas Santas or ‚ÄúBeach of the Holy Waters,‚Äù the beach is more often referred to by the name locals use for its halls of natural wonder: La Playa de las Catedrales, or ‚ÄúBeach of the Cathedrals.‚Äù So named in honor of the extraordinary natural rock formations resembling the soaring arches found in Gothic cathedrals, the unusual geology along this particular stretch of coastline gains all the more magic for the fact that its glory is only revealed at low tide.

As the waters recede, a vista of natural arches, cliffs, and sea caves are revealed. The arches themselves reach 90 feet in height, while deep, eroded caves stretch back into the cliffside. Connecting all these features are sandy patches formed by the schist and slate of the rocks themselves. Playa de Catedrales has become a popular destination for those who feel a more holy kinship with nature, or seek to experience a touch of the divine in a new, unexpected setting.

Strolling among these rocky outcroppings and exploring all these nooks and crannies at low tide is encouraged, though keeping a vigilant eye turned toward the returning sea is a must. Thanks to the region‚Äôs extremely planar coastline, the ocean can, at times, return alarmingly quickly, for once high tide has come, all traces of the cathedrals and those basking in their glory will be inundated until the cycle starts anew, revealing the secrets lying beneath their waves.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/l973uw/playa_de_las_catedrales_ribadeo_galicia_spain/glgisc6/,nastratin,1612077041

1527,"Also here from a guardian article the view of lawyers


Turner view

&gt; Turner said he believed it required AstraZeneca to do only as much as it reasonably could to fulfil the EU‚Äôs initial order of 300m doses with stock produced within the EU, which he said must reasonably be interpreted as not including the UK.
‚ÄúIt seems to me that, so far as the initial 300m doses are concerned, AstraZeneca has a pretty good ground for arguing that it is not required to divert vaccine manufactured in the UK.

&gt; ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs the conclusion really ‚Ä¶ Essentially, clause 5.1 says quite clearly AstraZeneca will be using its best reasonable efforts to manufacture the initial doses within the EU.‚Äù


Parkinson view

&gt; However, Richard Parkinson ‚Äì a commercial contracts partner at JMW solicitors ‚Äì said he interpreted the contract as requiring the firm to supply the 300m doses from manufacturing plants including those in the UK.
‚ÄúIf it has produced those doses, it would appear that it would have to supply them, as its efforts to date have resulted in the creation of that volume of vaccine.
‚ÄúThere doesn‚Äôt appear to be anything in the contract stating that the UK‚Äôs orders take priority. Therefore, AstraZeneca appears to be in a position whereby it has two customers who each seemingly have a valid claim on the doses that have been manufactured.‚Äù

Their agreement point

&gt; Both pointed out that the contract would come under Belgian jurisdiction. While Turner stressed that he is not qualified there, he said his analysis of the document led him to believe that ‚Äì should he be proven wrong and the EU proven right ‚Äì AstraZeneca would have no grounds to argue that doses must not be taken from the UK to make up the shortfall.

&gt; He explained that the contract with the EU sets out that no other deal should take precedence.
&gt; Parkinson added: ‚ÄúEven if the UK contract does say that it should be given priority, this doesn‚Äôt affect the EU‚Äôs position ‚Äì though it may give the UK another ground to bring a claim against AstraZeneca",,/r/europe/comments/l83rj8/accusations_of_british_brigading_of_the_subreddit/glg249n/,firdseven,1612066037

You're wrong since that refers to EU factories not the UK factories but either way. The EU are vaccine thieves.

"" The UK supply is manufactured here \[in the UK\] - at plants in Oxfordshire and Staffordshire. 

Some doses were sent to Germany and the  Netherlands last year for a process called fill-and-finish, which  involves putting it into vials. This is now being done at a plant in  Wrexham, creating a complete UK supply chain. 

And that arrangement, AstraZeneca sources  say, had no impact on the production problems the EU vaccine  manufacturing plants experienced. """,,/r/europe/comments/l8ht2t/eu_astrazeneca_megathread/glfo9o3/,amqh,1612058698

1694,"&gt;You are really belaboring this point, but it's total bollocks. Everybody was sinking all kinds of ships. Nazis didn't abide by the Geneva convention in their occupation of  USSR nor in their treatment of Soviet POWs.

Kettle, meet pot.

I doubt this is news to you or any mentally able adult, but for clarity‚Äôs sake: ‚ÄúHe started it!‚Äù is not a valid principle in laws of war.

The fact that the Germans committed warcrimes did not entitle the Soviets to also commit warcrimes. As a rule, Red Cross protection was respected on the Western front and even in the Pacific naval war (in other words, *even by the Japanese* to an extent). The Soviets expressly refused to do so, and this immensely added to the sufferings experienced on both sides of the Eastern front. Often the suffering of defenceless civilians.

&gt;Furthermore, the only neutral shipping in the Baltic was Swedish. Out of 270 Swedish ships that were sunk during WWII, only 6 were sunk by the Soviets. The majority was sunk by Germans, quite a few were hit by mines of various countries, at least 15 were sunk by the British.

About the ‚Äútotal bollocks‚Äù thing *again‚Ä¶*

Yes, most Swedish ships sunk during the war were sunk by the Germans‚Ä¶ in the Atlantic, were the principle of unrestricted submarine warfare applied since they were generally part of the Allied merchant system.

Whereas the Soviets practiced unrestricted submarine warfare not only against protected targets in coastal waters, *but even directly against neutral nations.* Neutral Swedish ships in the Baltic were regularly attacked and sunk, as were neutral ships of many other nations in the Black Sea were Soviet submarines killed e.g. several thousand Jews escaping to Palestine on neutral, civilian ships in neutral waters.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/l8lry0/this_day_in_1945_soviet_submarine_s13_sinks/glfqbx6/,LazyHussar,1612059796

&gt; Au contraire, I'm familiar enough with the complex and bureaucratic process by which it arrives at its decisions, hence why I voted to leave.

They made a threat to trigger article 16, something Boris Johnson did 3 weeks ago. The bureaucracy (which I'd love to hear exactly why you voted against) worked and nothing was done. You can really hang on the point if you want but you will just look a little silly talking about something that didnt happen.

That's not how it works. Jobs can remain low-wage even though they are in high demand for example because they become unprofitable for the company if they become higher paid.

\&gt;  And if rich immigrants integrate well, maybe we should only have rich immigrants. 

That ignores the entire reason we take in immigrants. In Europe we are usually strict to economic immigrants whereas refugees who are running from war or repression are allowed to move to our countries.

1876,"That's the thing, back then the argument was the same, that the political situation was apparently changing so much that a huge amount of people would want to leave. If that didn't end up being so true for the handover I find it questionable if it is true now. It remains to be seen. Either way if people want to leave, for good or bad, it's good that someone is making them welcome.

&gt; Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, predicts that within two years of taking control, Beijing will impose capital controls and replace Hong Kong's independent currency pegged to the U.S. dollar with Chinese renminbi. Explains Friedman, who discounts Beijing's assurances that this will never happen: ""I cannot conceive of a proud sovereign country like China entertaining the prospect of having two currencies at the same time.""

I mean, it's not at all clear to me that it is over.  There are AFAICT outstanding questions about export restrictions from the EU that a number of countries with outstanding orders that had been planned for production in the EU are probably going to care a great deal about.  If there's a shortfall in production, is the EU going to use the output to fill its usage first from exports?

&gt; however, I can't help but wonder what the comission expected to achieve here. It seems no positive goal could be reached besides protecting politicians' careers, and dangerous decisions were made to support that.

All the moves seemed to be ones that could theoretically increase the near-term EU vaccine supply.  It doesn't seem that mysterious to me.

Because I would wager that the majority of Europeans want something closer to the first and not the latter. The first is a noble aim and would be an amazing achievement given the continent's history. However, the EU in its current form is far too close to the latter and I believe unnecessarily so - far too many layers of political bodies, unnecessary institutions and overreaching policies to deliver the original intention of the EU (peace through trade).

What matters is when they knew it. They have an obligation to notify the EU as soon as possible if they expect lower supply than originally forecast. 

My understanding is that it takes a long time for the yield to be known, in which case it would be understandable if they were only telling the EU at late notice.

But the timetable is not a guaranteed thing. Literally no manufacturer has 100% met their production goals. None of them.

The problem advocates of a centralised European response face next time is that the lesson a lot of national politicians will learn from this is that it was a mistake to put all their eggs in a Brussels shaped basket. And, despite what Farage insists, it is national governments who call the shots. 

So whatever the next crisis is that turns up, will the EC even get the chance to try not to rise to the occasion? I'm not saying they won't, but this time the EC basically stepped into uncharted territory and made a reasonable case that intra-European vaccine competition was pointless and stupid.

It's okay to export, but not if it causes a federal contract not to be filled.

Highly inefficient approach to vaccine procurement, due to the technocratic superstate taking over and attempting to negotiate on behalf of each of its member states.

Then, a bafflingly aggressive move to attempt to impose a hard border on the island of Ireland, exposing the complete and utter hypocrisy of their previous stance during the Brexit negotiations.

&gt;explain how the UK couldn't have done the exact same thing regards to Covid

While what the EU did doesn't ""technically"" require a hard border and so doesn't ""technically"" breach the GFA. Practically the only way to enforce it requires a hard border.

Now, loss of phizer would be annoying but not at this stage a serious impediment. Between novavax and astra-zenica the UK has some 160 million doeses. Sufficient for the entire UK with spares. Not including any phizer stockpiled.

Meanwhile the EU currently doesn't have a working supply chain for *any* vaccine and the phizer one is dependent on a UK supplier for chemicals.

Nor do you, but we do know that the UK, EU, Australian, Swiss, American and so on factories all seem to have had similiar issues. Australia was just in the news today about issues with the Pfizer vaccine plants there... So... stop grasping and admit when you're wrong? 

""in the EU contract there is no distinction between UK labs and EU labs""

Not true, look to section 5.4 (on manufacturing) which says """"Astrazeneca shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to manufacture the vaccine at the sites located within the EU"" so, again you're wrong.

Everything you say is wrong, and I've demonstrated so.

I never... said it was the limiting factor? It is one of many factors that was considered, it allowed them close access to multiple countries purchasing their product. It's certainly a major cost to consider though, Pfizer requires the vaccine to be frozen so transport for them specifically is a big cost (also moderna). Less so for AZ and JJ.

2299,"&gt;I‚Äôm not sure what else the U.K. should do.

You know the answer as well as I do, it's just not comfortable.

Why is something acceptable for Argentina, Mexico, India or China, but inconceivable for the UK? Poorer countries with lower manufacturing capacity per capita and less potential to limit incidence through non-pharmaceutical interventions.

Sharing access to the vaccine from the beginning or at least after having immunized the highest risk group helps limit the loss of human lives globally. Inoculating low risk populations for example while in other countries high risk people are dying is morally reprehensible.

The idea that economic hardship is over once the own country is immunized is somewhat wishful thinking if half the world is still in economic crisis.

There are very dangerous geopolitical implications of vaccine nationalism. The supply chains of the vaccines are not national. Ingredients for the Pfizer vaccine are made in the UK, ingredients for the Moderna vaccine (even the one made in the US) are made in Germany, the vials are made in Germany, Brazil and India. The situation could explode in a heartbeat, stopping vaccine production almost entirely and leading to global conflict. Even countries not involved in vaccine supply chains may look at hurting strategic resources.

Here are a couple of articles on the matter:

The UK is hoarding the vaccine it produces in the UK but is also quite happy to take vaccine produced in the EU. Even potentially vaccines originally destined for the EU.

The fact the EU might legally be entitled to UK production is dismissed as bullshit because 'first come, first serve'. But that's not vaccine nationalism? 

The EU has also made huge investment in vaccines (including in UK production) and is also exporting vaccine across the entire planet.

2327,"&gt;All of what you say is true, but the politicians who drew nationalistic contracts were the UK. The EU let everyone produce their vaccines in the EU and export them, if there is a problem with the production, then it gets spread across all customers equally.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, the UK drew up a contract which was UK first, basically: everything that gets produced has to go to UK first before a certain amount is met.

You're mixing and matching between the Pfizer and AZ vaccine production to create a narrative of UK vaccine nationalism. EU allows Pfizer vaccine produced in the EU to be exported to other countries, and it has been. That's good of the EU, although it should also be noted that part of the production chain for the Pfizer vaccine is also based in the UK.

AZ vaccine production in the EU is only just ramping up and has not been exported outside the EU. The contract between AZ and EU effectively means that all AZ vaccine created in the EU goes to the EU up to the point they have met the initial contracted supply, just like the UK one presumably does for UK produced vaccine, though we haven't seen the details of the UK contract as it hasn't been released. The EU and UK contracts are essentially equivalent as best we know. Given all that, how is the UK acting any more nationalistically than the EU?

The issue at the heart of this is a contract dispute between the EU and AZ over whether the contract obliges AZ to make up shortfall in EU production with UK produced vaccine.

EU hasn't blocked anything, the mechanism to track and block exports if needed is there.

2476,"I actually have not seen much of that, but it is more complex than people give it credit (as always).

We are not manufacturing car parts, vaccines are biological so hard to get right and yeilds vary which impacts production. 

The UK had a jump start in many ways; Oxford uni being a world leader in vaccine research, UK gov pumping money to them to develop a vaccine, a strong pharmaceutical industry, putting plans on place well in advanced etc. 

You then have the nationalistic tendencies that have grown and now are dominant in UK politics (hence Brexit). So it is not surprising the UK is not willing to supply the EU after the last few years of bad blood between them (which is a shame, as it would be a good way to mend fences), hence the AZ &amp; UK gov contract has mechanisms to lock in the supply to the UK as a priority (nationalism + repayment of investment).

With the AZ supply chain being entirely internal to the UK it puts any other countries at a disadvantage. 

What angers me, even though I am part of my countries response in a small way, is that the is so little efforts to help the really poor countries - I am sorry but the EU should not be a priority for the UK, but countries where this is running rampant and unchecked should be. 

All the countries, within the EU or not have looked after themselves first to an extent, and countries like India are leading the way in supplying vaccines to other countries at the same time as its own citizens.

2521,"Or....the EC believed that they could use the fact that AstraZeneca is a British and Swedish company to manufacture a pretext for why they don't have doses available. That pretext being that the UK (in collusion with AZ) had diverted tens of millions of doses from the EU to the UK. The goal being to deflect responsibility for their failings in the procurement and distribution and create a villain to blame. Which explains why the EU kept bringing up the UK in its statements to the press, despite the dispute ostensibly being with a private company.

The problem with the EU's plan was that the only ""evidence"" they could come up with was that vaccine doses (from the UK, manufactured under the UK contract in a plant funded by the UK in the UK) were sent to the Netherlands to be bottled (due to the supply issues at the UK site) months ago. Which is a problem since the facility that the EU is claiming to be at issue here is in Belgium (and it's production issues are down to issues with it's precursor provider). Further, when the EU tried to bluff AZ into releasing it's contract (assuming that AZ would balk as any other manufacturer would), AZ did and it lined up with the claims AZ had made (including language that the EU had expressly denied as having been in the contract). The EU spent the last week ratcheting up it's claims of a vaccine war between the UK and EU, which culminated with Article 16 being invoked and then rescinded, but only after Ireland (whom the EU had neglected to even mention this too) called up the EC and basically said ""what the actual fuck."" 

This last week has been Van der Leyden and her cronies trying to manufacture a crisis to divert the blame for their fuckup on vaccination. Thankfully the UK didn't take the bait and it blew up in the EU's face. Now it's pretty clear that the EU is even less reliable than the US in that at least the US was honest enough to not promise vaccines. The EU promised vaccines, took countries' money, and then threatened not to deliver.

Much of the reporting I see from Europe or global English language media is turning ""the quest for a vaccine as a contest for narrow national advantage"". Western countries are only concerned about maximizing their own vaccine supply, more concerned about when they can vaccinate 20 something year olds than at risk people in other places.

I literally wrote an extremely upvoted parody piece about Brexit 5 years ago about how Brexit would deliver a ""golden age"" to the UK (sarcastically) and even I have come to doubt the EU's methods in achieving its political agenda in recent times.

So in essence, you've been in favor of the EU's aggressive pursuit of their political goals while you benefited, but started to doubt it's beneficial nature after no longer receiving the benefits. Duh? It's the EU's job to put member countries interests over foreign countries interests and the UK was always one of the countries that tried to make sure of that. 

The underlying realities haven't changed one bit beyond the UK now  being on the receiving end of the stick rather than the giving. What's changing is your opinion on the same principle. As for whether the the rest of the world tires of our antics, that's never going to matter as long as the single market holds. Access to us is the product the EU sells and that's never not going to be a great bargaining chip under capitalism. Capitalists don't say ""well then I sell to China instead"", they want to sell to China and the EU. So the three biggest markets get to dictate conditions for access to everyone else while trying to dictate conditions to each other.

So China gets to force the EU into a cooperation that steals our patents, the U.S. gets to force the EU to accept silicon valley disruption of our economy under 0 taxation and the EU gets to force the other two to follow every page of their guidebook on how to screw right-turning screws.

2566,"&gt; Which is main point of PiS propaganda. Obviously not truth.

It is truth I proven many evidence.

&gt;Majority of local media in one area owned by private company is. OK. Majority of local media countrywide controlled by the government isn't.

what PiS is doing is not ok but being owned by SINGLE company  is ALSO not ok, thats monopoly, which is something that is BAD for people, especially in media, because media always has some bias, no matter how good company is, which means ALL media owned by them will push one view, its best for people when they have diverse source of information.
The Office of Competition and Consumer Protection is supposed to prevent companies from getting monopoly in  any field, something it failed to do.

&gt;The one opened in 1991? Nothing to do with PO. OIr maybe you mena major rebuilding, which spanned many town mayors, including Our Most Holy Kaczy≈Ñski?

Sorry, yes I meant rebuilding, it was MPWiK responsible of what happen with Czajka:

Most of the world's largest construction concerns did not take part in the tender for the construction of the Warsaw sewage treatment plant. It happened as a result of the actions of MPWiK, which discouraged the world's tycoons from starting. After the first tender was announced in 2006, no one came forward. Companies interested in the tender sent letters to MPWiK in which they pointed out that the deadline for submitting bids was too short. German Hochtief estimated that the preparation of such an offer must take six months and therefore did not participate in the tender.

In the second tender for the construction of Czajki, the time for submitting bids was shortened to 10 weeks. Two bids were submitted: Budimex for EUR 766 million and Warbud for EUR 853 million. The tender was canceled due to too high prices. According to the findings of the Wprost weekly, the management of Warbud met with the Budimex authorities in order to establish a common tactic in the tender for the construction of Czajka. In the third tender, the deadline for submitting bids was 13 weeks. Three bids were submitted, one of which was invalid. Budimex stated that it could build the treatment plant by 2013, the deadline announced in the tender was 2010.

Warbud submitted a bid for EUR 564 million, and a third bid for EUR 299 million was made by the consortium Sistem Yapi from Istanbul, EMIT from Milan and Bateg from Berlin. Experts estimated that the cost of building the treatment plant is EUR 320 million. The Yapi consortium's offer was disqualified by MPWiK due to errors. The company declared that it was willing to improve everything that MPWiK had reservations about, without changing the price, but this offer remained unanswered.

The president of MPWiK, Artur Rypina, announced that a more expensive offer from Warbud was selected. It is worth noting that in other countries there have been cases of corruption in companies associated with Warbud. In July 2001, an Italian court convicted Alain Maetz, a manager at Veolia, whose daughter company Veolia Water Systems in consortium with Warbud won a tender to build Chaika, for a year and eight months in prison for bribing the head of the city council of Milan, who he had in return for bribe to choose his company in a tender to build a sewage treatment plant in Milan.

WTE started a consortium with Warbud, winning a tender in April 2007 for the construction of a sewage treatment plant with similar characteristics to Czajka in Istanbul. It was built for EUR 108 million, which is over five times cheaper than in Warsaw. A sewage treatment plant similar to Czajka in Milan was built for EUR 160 million.

As reported by the Wprost weekly, MPWiK prepared its own analysis to show that Warbud's offer was competitive. To prove their thesis, MPWiK employees provided false data. They said, inter alia, that the waste treatment plant in Budapest cost EUR 400 million. In fact, it was 290 million euros, of which 250 million euros was for construction. The remaining amount was the cost of managing the plant for four years. MPWiK used the given data in the justification to reject the protest against the result of the tender submitted by the Sistem Yapi company. In the case of Warbud, the net amount was also used for comparisons, while the value of all other investments was given as gross amounts.

Artur Rypina, the president of MPWiK, left his job a year after the tender for the construction of the Czajka treatment plant was completed. He was lavishly awarded by the President of Warsaw, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz. In 2008, he received the award of 50 thousand. PLN for good financial results, as well as for the positive conclusion of the tender for the treatment plant.

&gt;Ah, yes, the one that was suposed to be build in the '80s. Totally fault of PO, which didn't exist back then.

&gt;No, they didn't

what are you  talking about, I meant nuclear power plant PO said they would build:

In 2009, a daughter company PGE EJ 1 was established by Polska Grupa Energetyczna (PGE). It was to prepare and implement the construction of the first nuclear power plant in Poland. It was originally assumed that the first nuclear power plant would start supplying electricity to the grid as early as 2019.

In June 2012, the then MP Aleksander Grad (formerly Minister of the State Treasury in Donald Tusk's government) resigned from his parliamentary mandate and was appointed by the PGE supervisory board as president of PGE EJ and PGE EJ 1. Aleksander Grad received a salary of PLN 55,000. PLN per month. The vice-presidents of both companies also received similar salaries. In addition to high salaries, they also enjoyed high privileges.

Preparation for the construction of the power plant and all related analyzes were to cost at least PLN 1.5 billion!

It is not known what the company did, because over PLN 182 million was spent on preparations from 2009 to the end of 2014, and it is still unknown what the location of the nuclear power plant would be. The environmental and location research was conducted by the Australian company WorleyParsons, which was selected in a tender in 2013. The contract with WorleyParsons was signed for two years, its value was PLN 252 million.

In 2013, the head of the CBA, Pawe≈Ç Wojtunik, notified the Appellate Prosecutor's Office in Warsaw about a suspicion of a crime committed by the management board of PGE EJ 1. It was suspected that a crime of PLN 11 million was transferred to the Trefl Sopot volleyball team as part of the purchase of a service, which in the company's documents was described as: ""building and promoting positive emotions related to strategic investments in Pomerania, in particular those related to nuclear energy"" .

Decisions to transfer such huge funds to the sports club were taken by people associated with the Civic Platform, the then president of PGE (and at the same time PGE EJ and PGE EJ 1) Tomasz Zadroga and vice president Witold Dr√≥≈ºd≈º, who previously was the deputy minister in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration in the Donald government. Tusk. The case was transferred to the Regional Prosecutor's Office in P≈Çock and in 2015 the investigation was probably still pending.

I am NOT denying what PiS is doing, I just want people to remember that PO also did a lot of corrupted shit.",,/r/europe/comments/l7umrj/whats_happening_in_poland_should_be_a_warning_to/glckxkd/,Culaio,1611994189

Sorry but I don't believe for a second the UK would've offered that. This government?? Should I base this assumption on the exact of opposite how the British government consinstely behaved in recent years (and then some) ?

Also, if the EU thinks it has a legal case then it's no affront to say so. We don't want donations from the UK but what AZ can divert from the two British factories listed in the EU contract so both sides share the burden of a general shortfall in production. I agree the EU's behavious and rethoric wasn't always helpful. Then again we're rightly outraged at AZ's behaviour and interpretation of contracts. Maybe they should be blamed even more instead of the UK, although the latter is kinda implicated by insisting it must get *all* UK produced doses...

Do you have a vaccine surplus in the UK atm? Not afaik, and we're talking right now, not in 3 months lol.

Brexit was silly, as are the rabid Brexiteers you refer to who have certainly been prevalent these past few days, as is anyone who claimed these issues were ""unsolvable"".

So, if you ask me, is the interpretation that AZ just, like, forgot to work on this, and then fixed everything overnight when the EU started publicly dunking on them. They've been working to fix problems and ramp up production since before this whole affair started.

From the article:

&gt;AstraZeneca has fixed most of the issues affecting its European manufacturing and productivity at its plants there should start to increase, its chief executive said on Friday

This is PR. They've fixed more than half the issues they know of (does that include stuff discovered &amp; resolved long ago? I bet!), they don't intend to stop, and so production should start to increase, which is exactly what you'd expect as time goes on.

I've read the same sappy story of how various researchers recognised the danger early and their great governments pouring money into them about literally all of the major players in the vaccine business.

This whole thing with the ""three months"" is a talking point first made by the AZ CEO and is being completely uncritically parrotted by the UK media. But nobody has outlined any sort of justification for why the EU signing the contract later would excuse AZ from its contractual obligations.

Also nobody is threatening exports to Canada. The EU suspects that it is being shortchanged by AZ and has instituted a mechanism to monitor which vaccines are going where.

Besides this, if it weren't for the EU being the only major vaccine producer willing to share its yields, Canada would get nothing.",yurop,/r/europe/comments/l85ow2/eu_backtracks_on_decision_to_block_supply_of/glbkp0j/,cdot5,1611972128

2867,"&gt; Then go be the change and inform yourself. 

This isn't about me. I think I can name at least a dozen commissioners and their roles. Would probably remember all their names with some time. 

Most people don't dedicate enough energy to politics to become familiar with B-list politicians from a bunch of foreign countries that don't even speak their language, never appear on their tvs or newspapers, aren't elected, dont' campaign, etc. And they shouldn't, it's totally irrational. It makes no sense for the normal person. Frankly, it's hardly possible. 

If I were much yougner, maybe I could think this is a problem that is tractable through moral suasion. It's far more complicated than that - or maybe less complicated, actually. 

&gt; Making them politically more accountable is usually blocked by any number of nation governments. The EU is us. It's the best we can do collectively. And if it's not pretty then we share a part of the blame for that.

This is just empty emoting for teenagers. 

If there are no mechanisms to make EU politicians/bureaucrats accountable, then they can't have the levels of power they currently do. It's that simple. This isn't a matter for poetry; rather of what constitutes effective political and constitutional machinery.

AZ announces they can't meet targets, EU looks into it and finds that instead of stockpiling ahead of EMA approval, EU-produced vaccines went to the UK, EU finds this to be a breach of contract and begins talks with AZ.

Now the EU announces it will set up a mechanism to supervise what vaccines leave the Union so it can block shipments that it deems to breach contracts.

3211,"&gt; The measure also revokes the licences granted by the Renzi executive for over 12,000 Rwm Italia bombs that Riyadh used in Yemen
&gt; 
&gt; No more supplies of death, no more bombs to those who use them against civilians: the Italian government has decided to completely revoke - not suspend - the licences for the export of missiles and bombs to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the countries leading the Sunni coalition against the Houthi, the Shiite rebels in Yemen. This is the first time that an executive has used Law 185 of 1990 to cancel licences that were actually granted when Yemen was already fighting, as well as suspending the granting of new licences.
&gt; 
&gt; The government's decision should concern six different licences that have already been suspended, including the one called 'Mae 45560', with which the Renzi government had authorised the company Rwm Italia to export almost 20,000 Mk-type aerial bombs to Saudi Arabia, for a contract worth over ‚Ç¨411 million. Part of this supply has already been delivered by Rwm to the Saudis, so it is estimated that the blockade will affect the remaining part of the contract, i.e. about 12,700 bombs.
&gt; 
&gt; Up to now, the argument used to justify the green light to exports, contested by pacifists and humanitarian organisations, was that the government in Sana'a had asked for help to quell the offensive launched by the Houthi: it was not a question of war, but of internal issues. The argument lost its effectiveness when it became clear that a proxy clash was being fought on Yemeni soil: on one side Iran, which supports the Shiite rebels, and on the other Saudi Arabia, which supports the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. Any remaining doubts have been dispelled by the behaviour of the Saudi-led forces, which indiscriminately strike targets without any protection for civilians. And this is expressly provided for in Law 185 as an export impediment.
&gt; 
&gt; What is happening in Yemen, say experts commissioned by the UN Security Council, ""may constitute a war crime"". And the remains of Italian-made bombs have often been found in the bombing zones, to the point that the pacifist organisations have requested the opening of proceedings for culpable homicide against those responsible for the company and the heads of the Uama Authority for the export of armaments.
&gt; 
&gt; The measure has aroused the satisfaction of activists: according to Francesco Vignarca, coordinator of the Peace and Disarmament Network, ""this decision shows that when civil society and institutions work together, it is possible to stop the flow of weapons where there are conflicts and human rights are trampled on"". For Riccardo Noury, spokesman for Amnesty International, ""this is an important result, because it not only suspends but revokes licences already granted. It is proof of the effectiveness of civil society campaigns as a whole.
&gt; 
&gt; The decision comes on the heels of US President Joe Biden's decision to freeze military supplies to the Saudis and Emiratis. The civil war in Yemen has claimed over 230,000 lives and caused a humanitarian catastrophe affecting 22 million people.

&gt;There is widespread agreement (64%) that, "" I don't really think of Scots as a language - it's more just a way of speaking"" suggesting that for most adults in Scotland, Scots is not considered a language.

3370,"What happened is that shielding older people in care homes from corona (by disallowing visitors during the spring especially, including other measures) also shields them from other potentially mortal diseases such as the flu, which kills quite a few older people each year in Norway and Denmark as well as globally. Visitors were allowed again by summer at least here in Norway, but with strict visitation rules, and possibilities of temporary lockdowns and no visitors if the situation in one area gets too bad. 

Thankfully visitation to some extent is allowed again. We should protect our elders, but I know of some people who have died from other causes while visitation was forbidden, and they didn't get to see their families before they died, which isn't... Great either.

3389,"&gt;The Topic of 5.4 is: ""Manufacturing sides""!!!! This is where AZ is manufacturing!

Yes..? And it's explicit that AZ should use its best reasonable efforts to produce the vaccine at manufacturing sites in the EU (and then makes clear that ""for the purpose of this *Section 5.4 only* shall include the UK).  So that's a keep production in the EU (and UK) you need to talk to us if you want to produce elsewhere.

But that clearly applies to section 5.4 only. Section 5.1 is explicit that the Initial Doses are subject to greater restrictions, AZ must use its best reasonable efforts to manufacture that within the EU.

So again, as a consequence, the UK initial production coming from the UK, and the EU initial production coming from the EU, with later production able to go, and come from other sources is consistent and not contradictory.

&gt;the issue is not (only) production, the issue is the distribution of the available production

Again, the EU contract is clear that AZ should produce the initial doses in the EU, and obviously AZ has a pre-existing contract that mandates that UK production must go to the initial UK doses.. There isn't then an issue in terms of the distribution of the available production, but rather that the EU production, producing the initial doses is behind, and apparently for relatively reasonable reasons.

Neither the UK nor EU contract obliges AZ to divert production from outside of the EU to the EU to meet the EU's needs after all and AZ's contract with the UK would seem to specifically prevent that.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/l7q26n/the_contract_with_astrazeneca_is_online/gl916q0/,-ah,1611936090

Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer but in my role I am required to read and interpret legal documents and I review docs like this on a regular basis. 

Second Disclaimer: I am an ardent EU supporter / remainer / federalist. I am also a UK citizen. My opinion is not unbiased.

6.2 is completely unrelated to this scenario as competing contracts relates to if the EU signs a competing contract, the only references to competing contracts in the row is the UK AZ contract so 6.2 is not relevant. 

5.4 is a red herring - people are getting excited about it but it doesn't actually say AZ is obligated to manufacture vaccine in the UK, it largely relates to where the EU deems an acceptable vaccine site. It basically says ""we'd like you to make the vaccine in EU or UK sites, but we'll let you make it elsewhere as well as long as you tell us where in writing"". It's a very weak clause - it's largely there for quality control rather than ""you must supply us with vaccine from the UK"", it just says the EU will accept vaccines from the UK as equivalent to those in Europe. 

5.4 does make a very interesting distinction though in that the UK will be considered part of the EU **for the purposes of 5.4 only**. The express implication here is that for the rest of the document, the UK is not considered part of the EU. 

5.1 is the clause about the initial European doses which are in dispute and is the correct clause to reference that is in dispute. It makes clear reference to manufacture within the EU and given what was mentioned above it's implicit that the EU does not include the UK unless expressly stated otherwise.

Because there's no such thing as Scottish foreign policy. Scotland is called a country, but it's easier to think of them as a state with it's only regional legislature. Think Bavaria in Germany, a great deal of local power, but some powers are reserved to the Federal Government. 

The UK's issue is that England doesn't have devolution, so Westminster legislates for Britain in general *and* England. Which means MPs from devolved regions (such as Scotland) can vote on England-only matters because England doesn't have a devolved legislature. 

The British Parliament is both the legislature for Britain *and* England.

In this case, the best effort clause means that AZ will make its best effort to develop and produce the vaccine. If it fails, like GSK/Sanofi, it will be relieved of its contractual obligations. But that's not the case with AZ.

Believe me, you would not be happy to have a state that is even much more ""different"" than Bavaria. (btw. in my opinion, it is a mistake in history that Bavaria is with Germany. Many Bavarians tell me that they don't want to be called Germans. But that's another story)

3980," Diary excerpts from SS officer Felix detailing executions of Jews (ps he lived his retirement peacefully in Western Germany - like most German war criminals):

&gt;They \[Ukranians\] had rounded up 800 Jews there, who were also supposed to be shot by us tomorrow. They had now released them. We continued going along the road. There were hundreds of Jews walking along the street with blood pouring down their faces, holes in their heads, their hands broken and their eyes hanging out of their sockets.  
They were covered in blood. Some of them were carrying others who had collapsed. We went to the Citadel, there we saw things that few people have ever seen. At the entrance of the citadel there were soldiers standing guard. They were holding clubs as thick as a man‚Äôs wrist and were lashing out and hitting anyone who crossed their path.  
The Jews were pouring out of the entrance. There were rows of Jews lying one on top of the other like pigs whimpering horribly. The Jews kept streaming out of the citadel completely covered in blood. We stopped and tried to see who was in charge of the *Kommando.* ‚ÄòNobody‚Äô  
Someone had let the Jews go. They were just being hit out of rage and hatred. Nothing against that ‚Äì only they should not let the Jews walk about in such a state.

&gt;In an entry in the [Friedrich Kellner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Kellner) diary, ""[My Opposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Opposition)"", dated 28 October 1941, the German justice inspector recorded a conversation he had in [Laubach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laubach) with a German soldier who had witnessed a massacre in Poland. French officials at the Parisian branch of the [Barclays Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Bank) volunteered the names of their Jewish employees to Nazi authorities, and many of them ended up in the death camps. An insightful perspective is provided by Konnilyn G. Feig, who wrote:  
&gt;  
&gt;Hitler exterminated the Jews of Europe. But he did not do so alone. The task was so enormous, complex, time-consuming, and mentally and economically demanding that it took the best efforts of millions of Germans... All spheres of life in Germany actively participated: Businessmen, policemen, bankers, doctors, lawyers, soldiers, railroad and factory workers, chemists, pharmacists, foremen, production managers, economists, manufacturers, jewelers, diplomats, civil servants, propagandists, film makers and film stars, professors, teachers, politicians, mayors, party members, construction experts, art dealers, architects, landlords, janitors, truck drivers, clerks, industrialists, scientists, generals, and even shopkeepers‚Äîall were essential cogs in the machinery that accomplished the final solution.",Israel,/r/europe/comments/l6ytvk/french_holocaust_memorial_vandalized_on/gl747km/,studystudyhard,1611896552

And in the South the current genepool indicates constant mixing with various tribes all over Mediterranean, but then that land was never fully latinized anyways.

Its really interesting how strange may Italian history seem if you look at it from a large perspective. There is a constantly recurring pattern of invasion-assimilation-formation of a new nation with strong cultural influence of the peoples that were assimilated.

Brexit and this Pandemic have sped things up, but this is a natural progression when young people favour independence so heavily. The elderly are dying off (sadly at a faster rate than normal this year), and the young are coming of voting age. That support for Yes is just going to keep rising. 

So yes it is just a matter of when, not if. And the UK government denying a referendum is just going to make support rise even further. Telling a country that is overwhelmingly demanding independence, that they're not allowed a vote on it, is not going to end well. 

The best thing Boris could do is allow a referendum right now while they still have a chance at winning, and go all out on it. If they win, a third vote won't be happening for a very long time, especially as there's no gigantic change of circumstances like Brexit to point to.

Why was my comment deleted? It was an absolutely courteaus and gallant one üòö. A shame really!

The absolute ignorance of this guy. Do you even grasp the concept of feudalism? Normandy WAS part of France. It was a fief of the Kingdom of France. What happened in the 13th century was simply that it was incorporated into the Capetian royal domain by Philip Augustus and therefore came under the king's direct rule. I explained all this shit in my previous comment some genius deleted lol. If I were to follow your logic of only what is ruled directly by the French king should be considered France..... until Philip Augustus, only Paris and its surroundings were under the authority of the king. Normandy wasn't special. Auvergne, Anjou, Aquitaine, Flanders, Boulogne, Provence, Languedoc, etc etc were also ruled by vassals of the king semi-independently and were not part of the royal domain. So if Normandy wasn't part of France, neither was any of those fiefdoms. What was exactly France then? The Ile-de-France region only as it was the extent of the Capetian domain.

4117,"&gt;They're either ignorant or stupid.

Well, thank you.

Although for your information, this idiom also exists in French, means the exact same thing, and is used the exact same way. So you haven't said anything we don't already know.

Now, have you considered the possibility that, maybe, *you* could be mistaken in your interpretation of what was said?

In any case, I don't think a simple misunderstanding warrants such a gratuitous disdain and name calling. Let's chill?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Not hard for them to Google the definition of the phrase.

No, it isn't indeed. 

But the definition doesn't help us much if you're stuck in your own perspective and keep missing the point u/NuggetLord99 was making, and why he made it.

&gt;*call (one's) bluff*
&gt;
&gt;1. To challenge someone to act on their threat or prove that their claim or boast is true, when one believes they are making a false claim or idle threat (i.e. bluffing).
&gt;
&gt;2. **To disprove a bluff. Whereas the first usage simply indicates a challenge, this usage indicates that the challenge resulted in the disproval.**

Emphasis is obviously mine, and highlights the reason u/NuggetLord99 said what he said.

With the latter definition in mind, OP claiming that ""*AZ is calling the bluff of the EC""* is inherently **a loaded statement**, whether you realise or not, and whether he wanted it to be or not. It suggests that there is (to one extent or another) some merit to the idea that the EC may potentially be bluffing. And that's fine, why not.

But because the OP believes there's no foul play at all from the EC, the request to disclose the details of the contract is, from his perspective, a solid clue that **there possibly couldn't be any bluff to be called in the first place**, making the statement of OP completely uncalled for.

The root of this inane argument is straightforward, really: this is just a matter of fucking perspective.

What to get from all this is that OP either:

- misused or was blind to the equivocal interpretation that idiom can have -- which would be ironic, considering your patronising input ;
- or expressed his personal belief that the EC could effectively be bluffing -- which, again, is a perfectly acceptable opinion, *but then* it will inevitably be perceived as somehow siding with AZ, because it postulates that there is a bluff in the first place... and we're back to square one.

The word Empire (except for the HRE) wasn‚Äôt even really used then, the entire purpose of ‚ÄòAngevin Empire‚Äô is to summarise an otherwise complicated affair into one succinct, easy to understand term, hence its use in a passing joke in regards to your original comment of 

Well how am I supposed to tell jokes apart from historical discussions about history?! Especially when I've come accross many people who believe what you wrote unironically. Have you taken a look at the thread you're currently on?!

&gt; Furthermore, England being a part of Britain comes under the title of British, which means yes, there have been many. Whilst Normandie, Anjou and Aquitaine obviously came under De jure French rule, they were absolutely relevant in regards to the power projection England had on the continent and the multiple centuries of conflict that resulted from said holdings, ergo it comes under the title of English escapades onto the continent, just because they were through inheritance as opposed to conquering doesn't discount nor discredit them, and besides, more often than not the Kings of England would refuse to give homage to the King of France as they saw it beneath them, it led to countless conflicts. The implication that because they were de jure French territory, that they‚Äôre irrelevant is quite frankly laughable, if they were so irrelevant then there would have been peaceful coexistence and there wouldn‚Äôt have been the confiscation of Gascony, or the intrigue between Henry II‚Äôs sons and the King of France, because hey, at the end of the day they‚Äôre all French territory just ruled by people who happen to be the Kings of England?! Why was Philip Augustus obsessed about retaking French Land if they were again, just French holdings in the hands of French nobles who happen to also be the Kings of England?


I do not quite think you grasp how feudalism worked in France. You seem to have this weird idea in mind of a divided France where half of France was ruled by French kings and the other half by the Plantagenet as their vassals. That is not the case at all. For much of the High Middle Ages, the French kings pretty much only truly ruled the region of Ile-de-France or let's just say it Paris. Everything else was ruled by their vassals and the king was pretty much irrelevant. The Plantagenets weren't some kind of unique breed. They were neither the only French lords to be vassals nor the only lords the Kings of France had to wage war against in order to submit them to their rule or absorb their domains into the royal demesne. For reference, take a look at the evolution of the ""Crown lands of France"". Why was Philip obsessed in retaking French lands from the Plantagenet if they were French lands? For the same reason he was obsessed with taking Auvergne, Flanders, Boulogne, Provence, the Languedoc etc, went to war with other French vassals over them and even agreed to launch fucking crusades over some of them....... Power?! To boost his own territorial holdings? To get rid of the feudalism nonsense and consolidate his kingdom? If the point you're making is that if the French lands which formed the Angevin Empire were indeed French and not English, the kings of France wouldn't have needed to seize them... then we could apply it to the entire kingdom and just deduce that the kingdom of France didn't even exist, only the ""kingdom of Paris and its surroundings"" did. The French lands under the Plantagenet and the rest of French fiefs outside of Ile-de-France had to be seized by the kings as they were outside of their sphere of influence. Nothing but Ile-de-France in the Kingdom of France could be considered ""French lands"".


&gt; I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre even bringing up the result of the 100 years‚Äô war as it has absolutely nothing to do with the topic in hand, and that doesn‚Äôt take away from the success that Edward III and the Black Prince found at Sluys, Poitiers, Crecy, his campaigns in Aquitaine etc, and general Chevauchee, nor does it take away Henry V‚Äôs (who undeniably considered himself to be English before French) victories at Azincourt and the Treaty of Troyes, which are once again, more examples of ‚ÄòBritish‚Äô adventures in Europe.

Why are you bringing this up as a point of contention when I clearly implied that English occupied territories in the HYW did count lmao. You thought it was said sarcastically?

&gt;[""We find that an eroding actor base, shrinking opportunities in liberalized electricity markets, the break-up of existing networks, loss of legitimacy, increasing cost and time overruns, and abandoned projects are clear indications of decline. Also, increasingly fierce competition from natural gas, solar PV, wind, and energy-storage technologies speaks against nuclear in the electricity sector.

There is no business case for it.

Between 1951 and 2017, none of the 674 nuclear reactors built was done so with private capital under competitive conditions. Large state subsidies were used in the cases where private capital flowed into financing the nuclear industry....

&gt; EU also ordered much much more doses than actually needed for entirety of it's population. AZ fucked up (even if not completely in legal sense, that we don't know), can't blame EU for that, apparently they are even trying to put pressure on the company.

For taking so long to close the contracts with vaccines that now the EU lags well behind the UK and the US.

Also for caring so much about cost that the US nad the UK spent 7 times more on vaccine development and procurement - so now they have better access.

Please?' So people hopped into their cars and on their trains and headed all over the UK potentially spreading it across public transport etc., and then were essentially given the choice of whether to quarantine or not, because the UK government/police had no way of knowing who was meant to quarantine and enforcing it.

A political unification would also mean a more streamlined approach on vaccine creation and business orders. Companies wouldn't have to jungle between two different customers (heck, they could not even subscribe on two each other conflicting contracts at the same time), since the distribution would be an issue afterwards and rather between the members of the union. The way things stand after Brexit is that the distribution is being fought about at the steps of the producing company and with no sort of team work in sight but a ""me first"" attitude on both sides. This is how you deal with people you have never known in your life. The UK and EU are not actually that way, but Brexit aimed for that status quo again. Pulling in two different directions on the vaccine creation process endangers the whole entity behind the vaccine and therefore the whole process. I don't think you would deny that in any way. Reason number one why people let Brexit just happen somehow is because everybody assumed it would take a lot of time until a real divide between UK and EU would appear.

4886,"&gt; In a nutshell, here is why EU officials are furious with AstraZeneca. They say the contract between them and the pharmaceutical giant clearly stipulates that the two main vaccine production factories in the UK are to be classed as primary manufacturing sites, and the production sites in Belgium and the Netherlands are secondary priorities.

 &gt; In fact, EU officials point out to me that EU money went into upgrading the facilities in the UK and that they fully expected it to be operational for them. This has turned into a deeply unpleasant row, and sets the stage for a difficult meeting with the UK-Swedish company.

4887,"The UK was promised was 20m doses of AZ by end of 2020 and got like 0.5m or something. Apparently some of that 0.5m came from a test batch at an EU plant which is what has created the animosity about vaccine exports. The production contractors selected by the EU had not worked with AZ before and the oxford vaccine is a novel framework so sadly these delays were somewhat expected but the fact that the UK facilities are now getting good yields (3x the European plants) after having low yields a few months back suggests that AZ have the technical ability to resolve these issues with the contractors and they should just be given time to do so. 

Lets still wait for full information about the contracts but going off what has been said if the contract with the UK sets a threshold of UK doses before for export can occur and the EU contract is as AZ claim to deliver 100m doses before spring on a best effort basis then even if it ended up in the courts the ECJ would likely rule in favour of the UK here. Whether those contracts are ""fair"" doesn't matter if they were the contracts that were signed and they aren't contradictory.

Also perhaps the most important fact in all this is that Oxford made AZ sign a not for profit contract and this vaccine is 10x cheaper than BioNTech/Pfizer who are aiming to make big profits ($13bn+ apparently). It's hard on that basis to claim that AZ are not acting under their best effort/good faith.",,/r/europe/comments/l66xh4/eu_says_astrazeneca_must_supply_covid_vaccines/gl2jzfx/,Hey_Rhys,1611828310

4951,"&gt; I don't think that has to be a bad thing, and what's best probably depends on who you ask. it's of little surprise that the US don't want anything that would result in freedom of movement.

good thing that we don't have to copy everything the US does. I, for one, love the freedom of movement. Without being a doctor, a super specialised engineer, etc I was able to have my Italian and British degrees recognised automatically in the whole of the EU and work in Germany and the Netherlands with the same ease I had in Italy and gained invaluable work and life experience. But if you want these things to be elitist things reserved to a priviliged few, be my guest

&gt; now it's my turn to say I am not sure if you are being intentionally misleading or you just ignore the facts out of ignorance. I'm gonna give you the benefit of doubt.
&gt; 
&gt; freedom of movement has resulted in countries not being able to control their borders, whilst some dileberately didn't so they could let refugees/migrants head straight to britain (calais), and even if I'm wrong on that one, politically speaking the eu has been weak on protecting its borders from non eu migration as we saw with greece, italy, and merkel inviting people over on a whim, which pissed a lot of countries off and threatened the union way more than the negative sides of the free trade agreements ever will

Freedom of movement only means that border controls do not apply to EU citizens and movement inside the EU. Members that border non EU countries are required to apply those controls for the whole of the union. As for the migrants camping in britain, they are the result of the Dublin convention on refugees, something that members like Britain or France supported with gusto, since it unloaded the burder of refugee rescuing and asylum seeking process entirely onto the shoulders of countries like Greece and Italy, which had no choice (other than turning their backs on refugees drowning) given their geography. If Britain, France, the US, etc stopped meddling in the middle east and africa, we wouldn't have so many refugees comng our way, but invading countries is such a consolidated tradition in these countries, I'm not gonna hold my breath on that. In any case EU institutions can only do what EU members collectively allow it. And members like the UK have consistently wanted the EU to have as little power as possible, so blame yourself and those who only want the EU to handle what is politically inconvenient at home. 

Also, the EU does little on its own. When it legislates on something, it expects the national governments and agencies to enforce the law, as it doesn't have the personnel to do it on its own, nor (again) the authorization from member countries, which wanted to retain that competency. You know what would have worked? Only allowing in the EU members that have the capabilities to enforce the law and standards of the other EU members, but Britain was very consistent in campaigning for enlargement at all costs, so that the EU would be watered down and integration process made more difficult.

Also Angela Merkel didn't invite anyone from outside the EU. When she invited those refugees you mention, they were already inside the EU, camping at the station in Budapest or in the camps of Greece. If anything, she relieved the pressure onto those countries. I know it's difficult to process being humane for people like you, but some people (like Angela Merkel, herself a political refugee) are. 

&gt; doesn't change the fact that some take the chance of breaking the law, and unfortunately some do so tragically

the US or Australia have the same issues with refugees and don't have FoM with anyone, so the problem is not the EU. It's the fact that you can't profess to support human rights and the rule of law and at the same time reject the refugees without going through the proper channels. And those channels will inevitably have faults in the system, no matter how well run. You expect the UK to be flawless as well or is it just the EU that needs to be everything to everybody?

&gt; anyway, you're massively focusing on FoM, which I didn't even bring up. whilst FoM can be controversial at times with the EU among other things there's other stuff like the euro which a lot of countries are clearly slow to convert to, harmonising tax rates and a few other things that aren't going down so well.

Whataboutism. The topic of the article and the conversation is about FoM. You literally replied to someone who was talking about FoM.

https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/astrazeneca-ceo-stresses-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-maneuvering-as-it-misses  

As late as November 23, AZ still claimed in public that they would produce drug substance for 200 million doses by the end of 2020. AZ themselves, not counting productions from licensees such as the SII.

https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-astrazeneca-cheng/astrazeneca-will-have-enough-covid-19-vaccine-for-200-million-doses-this-year-idUKKBN2830XG?edition-redirect=uk

They now say that their world wide production capacity for February, after more than two months of resolving production problems and ramping up, is only 100 million doses. Yes, ramping up to capacity takes time, thus their December capacity must have been much lower. Thus, to even get close to hitting that late November estimate, they would have needed to already have drug substance for 100+ million doses stocked up at the time in some freezers. Which in turn they knew they didn't, because they had decided to start production much later than originally promised.

And if simply disagreeing (with your personal perspective) on how taxes being spent, or how borders are handled is enough for you to paint one side with the brush of being beyond the pale, I think that would speak more to your intolerance than theirs.

5220,"You know, as an EU citizen I am really getting tired of this. Ever since Brexit started, we constantly get bashed and looked down upon from the UK, who constantly feel the need to remind us how shit the EU is.
Is it easier to do certain things if you are on your own rather than in a group of 27? Of course. But we have decided to work together on this continent and we stick to it and I think I speak for many Europeans if I say we are proud of this model, even if it needs improvements.
While the US, the UK, India and China have all implemented a ‚Äûme first‚Äú strategy, the EU said they want to make sure anyone has access to a vaccine at the same time, as long as it is shared equally. All of the Biontech jabs, all of the Moderna jabs and a large part of the AZ jabs were produced in the EU and shipped to the UK. This allowed them to perform their great vaccination campaign. Did anyone in the EU complain about that? No. Did anyone have a problem with that? No. Because everyone expected that we work together.
Now the EU finds itself in a position where a UK company just decides to not only cut production drastically and breaches contract, but it also decides that this would only affect EU citizens. The EU naturally complains about that and (naively) asks for help, since the EU was willing to give others a fair share from the beginning as well, enabling the UK‚Äôs vaccination programme. And what is the reaction from the UK? ‚ÄöThey are trying to steal our vaccines!‚Äò. What about when we gave you our vaccines, that doesn‚Äôt count? 
Like I said, I am tired of constantly hearing how shit we are, when at the same time EU manufacturing made best efforts to support the UK.

The eu would literally just be stealing other countries allocations, that they legally bought. 

&gt;We didn't and here we are. Maybe the UK wouldn't have that much vaccines but hey if it's other people that don't have vaccines its fine it seems.

Again. Thats not how this works. If the eu didnt let pfizer produce vaccines for the uk and other countries around the world from within the eu. Then they would have just set up production for them elsewhere. The uk and every other pfizer customer would not have just said oh well we wont order that one then.",,/r/europe/comments/l6d6we/eu_commissioner_astrazeneca_logic_might_work_at/gl1bf59/,TomPWD,1611800311

Based on purely irrational sentiment, with no evidence given. Good job. I think I'll accuse Merkel of eating babies. Prove she didn't. Lol. 

&gt;Let me remind you. The UK government made an announcement in December that they will receive 4 million doses of the AZ vaccine (delivered from the EU) by the end of the year.

&gt;3 weeks later and they got delivered 500.000 doses, 1/8ths of the promised numbers.

The UK government is aware that many things can go wrong with a production line during a pandemic and isn't desperately trying to save face and pretend it didn't mismanage the ordering of vaccines. 

&gt;It's very obvious that AZ didn't announce the delay to the government. (Or the government decided to not make it public, your choice which for the 2 is reasonable)

Were there previous attempts/failures before William gave it a try in 1066? I am geniunely asking. After the Norman takeover, followed by the stint of the Angevins, England wasn't really the same kingdom anymore. Its political class, military structure, law and customs were completely altered. 

I don't think anybody in France wanted to or tried to invade England until that fucker William decided to start his shenanigans. England back then wasn't exactly a rich/prosperous kingdom or at least when compared to French provinces. Until the era of the crusades, which consequently began to develop French appetite for foreign (meaning non French lands), french lords were mostly focused on trying to steal each other lands/castles. Some fiefdoms of the Kingdom of France taken individually were richer than England in the High Middle Ages (Aquitaine, Flanders and Normandy for example). Even though he was more powerful than the French king Philip I (as were many other French lords) because he ruled one of the most powerful and richest fiefs of France, William of Normandy was still a vassal of his, so his subject/inferior. Him being recognized as an equal of his sovereign (as monarch of a foreign state) and not just his vassal was one of the major reasons he wanted England so bad when the opportunity to be king there presented itself.",,/r/europe/comments/l60w99/viking_adventures_in_europe_1280x841/gkz8ix5/,Okiro_Benihime,1611770432

5630,"Your whole perspective irrationally assumes that AZ lied and due to some negligence of their own failed to meet quotas. Bear in mind that AZ had very little financial incentive to lie to the EU about this. The 300 million the EU gave them what a drop in the bucket compared to the billions they've received.

The AZ production predictions were no doubt made by experts based on production capacity given the data they had at the time. Anything else would be negligent and big pharma is just not that dumb or legally naive. The shortfall may well because of unforeseen events e.g. covid restrictions due to 2nd variant. 

Prove that this was not the case in a court of law or wind your neck in and shut up. 

The CEO might look bad to you rabid Europhiles, but to the rest of the world he looks like the voice of reason, and the EU looks like a bunch of desperate technocrats who are losing control of public sentiment and are resorting to desperate ploys to push guilt onto someone else.

5665,"Text of Times article by Bruno Waterfield and Chris Smyth:

The EU has demanded that tens of millions of Covid-19 vaccine doses made in British Astrazeneca factories be diverted to Europe.

The call marks a significant political escalation in a deepening post-Brexit conflict that has included German threats to block exports of other vaccinations, such as Pfizer‚Äôs, from the EU to the UK.

The European Commission has accused Astrazeneca of reneging on vaccine delivery agreements, further threatening EU vaccination programmes that are falling behind.

Britain has vaccinated about 11 per cent of its adult population while the EU average is still just over 2 per cent, a gap that is growing amid a deepening European political crisis over vaccines.

Astrazeneca has said that vaccines developed by Oxford University and produced in Britain‚Äôs factories are part of the British supply chain, which it adds is running successfully because the UK signed contracts three months before the EU.

Stella Kyriakides, the European health commissioner, has rejected the argument and demanded that the vaccines presently produced in Britain for domestic use be sent to the EU instead.

In talks tonight, Mrs Kyriakides will tell Astrazeneca that the company is legally obliged to use its two British factories to make up the shortfall of up to 70 million doses to the EU.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no priority clause,‚Äù she said, adding the EU ‚Äúloses people every day‚Äù to the pandemic. ‚ÄúWe reject the logic of ‚Äòfirst come, first served‚Äô. That may work at the neighbourhood butcher‚Äôs but not in a contract. In our contract it is not specified that any country or the UK has priority because it signed earlier.‚Äù

Astrazeneca, which is based in Cambridge, has told the commission that production problems at a Belgian factory means that it cannot supply 100 million doses agreed in an advance purchasing agreement with the EU.

The UK government is preparing to dismiss the EU demands, insisting that it has a clear right to the first 100 million Astrazeneca doses produced in Britain. The company would be free to supply other countries only once they had ‚Äúfulfilled their commitment‚Äù to the British government, sources said.

They suggested Pascal Soriot, the company‚Äôs chief executive, had accepted this point when he said in yesterday‚Äôs interview: ‚ÄúIn the EU agreement it is mentioned that the manufacturing sites in the UK were an option for Europe but only later.‚Äù

Astrazeneca said: ‚ÄúEach supply chain was developed with input and investment from specific countries or international organisations based on the supply agreements, including our agreement with the European Commission.

‚ÄúAs each supply chain has been set up to meet the needs of a specific agreement, the vaccine produced from any supply chain is dedicated to the relevant countries or regions and makes use of local manufacturing wherever possible.‚Äù

So far Britain has vaccinated 6.9 million people with both the Astrazeneca and Pfizer vaccines. Although this represents a greater proportion of the population than in any other European country, it is still a long way off full coverage. Diverting tens of millions of doses could threaten the continued success of the British programme.

Astrazeneca has four production plants in Europe ‚Äî two in the UK, one in Belgium and one in Germany ‚Äî with, the commission said, all factories tied to the EU contracts for vaccines.

‚ÄúIf UK plants are working better, are we expecting UK plants to deliver doses to the EU? Yes, we do,‚Äù said the commission‚Äôs spokesman. ‚ÄúThey are part of our contract.‚Äù

Germany is backing plans to introduce export restrictions of vaccines produced in the EU if they threaten any shortfall for Europe, potentially blocking shipments to the UK.

The call for export restrictions raise the spectre of the EU putting pressure on Pfizer, or other Europe-based vaccine producers, to cut shipments to Britain if Astrazeneca and the UK government do not relent.

Yesterday Mr Soriot accused the EU of getting too ‚Äúemotional‚Äù and linked his company‚Äôs British production to the future of the vaccination programme.

‚ÄúThe UK agreement was reached in June, three months before the European one. As you could imagine, the UK government said the supply coming out of the UK supply chain would go to the UK first. Basically, that‚Äôs how it is,‚Äù he told a group of European newspapers.

‚ÄúAs soon as we have reached a sufficient number of vaccinations in the UK, we will be able to use that site to help Europe as well. But the contract with the UK was signed first and the UK, of course, said ‚Äòyou supply us first‚Äô, and this is fair enough.‚Äù",China,/r/europe/comments/l6aknf/eu_tells_britain_give_us_your_covid_vaccines/gkz99wd/,Maitai_Haier,1611770686

5678,"&gt;It was going to be 4 millions, ended up only 500k doses being sent to the UK. 

No, it was 4 million. The reason that the 4 million doses could not be used immediately was because the MHRA only could start checking them after they had approved them:

&gt;People involved in the vaccine procurement project have stated that there are already several million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK ready to be deployed.
&gt;
&gt;Kate Bingham, outgoing head of the UK government‚Äôs Vaccines Taskforce, told the science select committee on 4 November: ‚ÄúAs of now, we have low numbers of million doses in bulk drug substance, not vialled, and the third batch of 1,000-litre manufacturing is now under way.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúThat should probably get us up to about 4 million doses at the end of the year.‚Äù
&gt;
She added: ‚ÄúWe have not yet put it into vials because, as soon as you do that, you start the clock for its shelf life and how quickly you have to use the vaccine.‚Äù
&gt;
&gt;Media reports today have speculated that this process of putting the vaccine into vials is the reason why only 530,000 doses are available from Monday.
&gt;
&gt;But the government has not mentioned vials in its explanation.
&gt;
&gt;Instead, a spokesman said that the MHRA, the regulator which recently approved the AstraZeneca vaccine, ‚Äúset out conditions with their authorisation on 30 December and batch testing is taking place to ensure the vaccines consistently meet these strict requirements‚Äù.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúThis could not be done before the conditions were outlined by the MHRA.‚Äù

""Dem Konzern zufolge sind die Lieferketten getrennt, aber das stimmt nicht. Bis vor wenigen Tagen ist die Abf√ºllung des Impfstoffs f√ºr Gro√übritannien noch im deutschen Dessau erfolgt. Umgekehrt werden im Vertrag mit der EU auch zwei Produktionsstandorte in Gro√übritannien erw√§hnt.""

&gt;The health policy spokesman for the European People's Party in the European Parliament, Peter Liese (CDU), told DW that he found AstraZeneca's explanation that there were supply bottlenecks only for the EU to be implausible.

Conversely, the contract with the EU also mentions two production sites in the UK."" AstraZeneca must decide whether it wants to act like a British or an international corporation, Liese added.

Well, that is the problem right. They say they wont. It is fine to use production capacity in the EU to send millions of doses to the UK but the UK made sure that no doses are send from the UK to the EU. 

The problem is how vague AZ is about the details and how late they were with the information.

5863," The EU published a redacted version of their advanced purchase agreement with curevac a few days ago. This should be consistent with the AZ and other supplier agreements.

Interestingly, it states:

1.12. DELAYS

1.12.1. The Parties acknowledge that there is a risk that (i) the time-line for the EU marketing authorisation or (ii) the time-line for scaling up the production of the Product may be delayed or that (iii) an EU marketing authorisation may not be granted at all or (iv) the production of the Product may not be feasible.

1.12.2. If there is a delay in the supply of the Product compared to the estimated delivery schedule, the contractor will inform the Commission as soon as reasonably possible, explain the reasons for such delay and submit a revised delivery schedule to the Commission which should be as close as possible to the estimated delivery schedule while taking into account the reasons for the delay.

1.12.3. The consequences if no EU marketing authorisation is granted or the production of the Product is not feasible are exclusively dealt with in Article II.14.

This does indeed suggest a 'best endevours' agreement was drawn up.

It seems very unfair that the EU are throwing their weight around like this when contractual obligations have been met.

5872,"That is an incredibly damaging approach to the issue. You're basically saying ""let's pretend it's not an issue and sweep it under the rug"". Or the American equivalent: ""let's offer our thoughts and prayers"".

First of all, it's a coincidence that so many PMs are women now (or the issue was given the spotlight). Of the past ten PMs, only 3 were women in Finland, 3 (of which one served two terms) in Norway, 2 in Denmark and 2 in Iceland. So the majority of the time the PMs are still men.

Second, the only way to tackle a problem is to put it in the spotlight. Only when you have ""solved"" the problem can you ""ignore"" it. Of course, everyone wants to reach a point where it's a non-issue. The LGBT community wants to reach a point where coming out isn't necessary because no assumption of heteronormativity will be made. But we're not there yet.

The same thing applies here. Statistically speaking, it is not all that unlikely that 6/8 (or 75%) of PMs in a given region are women if there is perfect gender equality. Roll a die eight times and tell me how many times you got an odd number, probably not exactly four times! However, people ARE amazed by the fact that there are so many women, and that shows that we're not yet at the point where we can say: ""the issue has been resolved and we don't need highlight it anymore"".

It's not an ""American"" way to tackle the issue! The American way is to ignore the issue. Look at how Republicans talk about the issue of inequality, gun violence, racism: ""let's not politicize this"" they say. The US is ""obsessed"" with those things because they have issues with them. But, guess what? So does Europe! We have a real antisemitism issue (even in Germany). European policemen may not shoot black people on the street, but have an Arab-sounding name and try to get a job in Europe.

Many of the problems with gender, race, religion the US has, we have, too, in Europe. BUT, people like you choose to ignore that problem and say ""The European way is not to notice the differences and not to discriminate."" But that's a lie. The European way is to notice differences and discriminate just as much as Americans. The only difference is that we don't shoot people on the street, so it doesn't show up on the news.

If you really think that ""ignoring"" the problem, or pretending that there isn't one, is how you should solve it. You're doing nothing. NOTHING. To solve the issue. Instead, you're helping maintain the staus-quo, which is just as bad as wanting the discriminatory practices. By not being willing to step up and actually help push women, LGBT people, immigrants, persons of colour, persons of religious minorities forward in the queue, you're not actually supporting the equality movement and you're showing them that you don't care.",,/r/europe/comments/l4nedh/estonias_1st_female_pm_gets_sworn_in_tomorrow/gkyd8cu/,Landsted,1611759790

6081,"I applaud your adorable efforts to build a whataboutism. 

Germany does not call its' members countries (Staat). It calls them Land/L√§nder. This is better translated as states and not countries. All states have a great degree of autonomy, own Parlament, own elections, etc. They lack foreign diplomacy capacity, which is handled by the Bund - translated as union.

Now, this is de jure. De facto, there is a shared identity between all German states, which is what holds the union together. Even so, if a Land chooses to go out of the Bund, this is still possible, as it was discussed several years ago, as Bavaria was questioning if it may leave the Bund. Since there was no widespread support, this question was more of a theoretical and no voting ever took place.

In the UK the Scotts and the English are 2 separate folks, which don't share such identity. This means that the union is not as strong as the German one, as it is based on the fact that Elisabeth did not have any children of her own and the crown was offered to the Scottish king. Due to the lack of shared identity, whenever the Scotts feel misrepresented by London, they will think of having a country of their own, which will better represent them and serve their needs. Forcing them to continue being part of a union against their will is counterproductive, as it would have been if the EU forced the UK to continue being part of the EU.

The reason why Boris is afraid of allowing a second referendum is because he knows that the chances of the UK becoming... just K is quite high. And yet he never bothered to try to reach to the Scotts and build bridges. He is an even worse prime minister then Chamberlain, as Chamberlain had only one ""peace in our time"" moment, and Boris had 5: the Brexit deal, the Corona pandemic, Northern Ireland, Gibraltar and last but not least - Scotland.

Yes, there is racism in America. And yes, Trump definitely brought out those sentiments in the racist crowd.

Sure, some things could have been handled better but at the end of the day, these are the uncomfortable protests and discussions that have to be had.

In my opinion, European/Asian countries are so homogenous that your countries haven't even gotten to this uncomfortable phase that America is at.

Stop thinking all of America is racist because of a very small and vocal subgroup. We have elected officials who are black, brown, yellow, etc. and minorities here hold huge positions of power across all industries. Could a country that's as racist as some of you think really do all that?

I've only backpacked through Europe during college, but I've gotten more looks and jokes about my race than I ever have in America my entire life.

6145,"Snowball fights have had a long history in non-violent protests. One notable example of this was the riots that broke out in London to protest the Crimean War. (no, not that one - the original one)

&gt; Last Sunday, during morning service, a crowd of about 1,500 people assembled in Trafalgar Square near St. Martin's, where they amused themselves by bombarding buses, cabs and pedestrians with snowballs. 

&gt; Because of the noise outside the church doors, the service had to be discontinued. As soon as the police intervened, they became the main object of attack, and within a few minutes, some constables were unable to look either left or right because of the piles of snow which had collected on their shoulders, helmets, etc. Soldiers who wanted to return to their barracks from church, were definitely forced to retreat, and their English phlegm was put to a severe test. 

&gt; About 100 special constables had to be sent to the scene of battle. Eventually the police made use of their truncheons, and fierce fighting ensued. Four ringleaders were captured and dragged to the police station in spite of several attempts in Chandos Street and Russell Street to free them from the arm of the law.

6163,"&gt; There were reports on China camps...

I am aware of that. And the conditions aren't great. But we are talking about whether a genocide is happening. Not whether China is violating human rights or not.

&gt; https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dEkliuqQo-g

I mean it is a very good cut video which makes everything dramatic and mysterious. Music and color setting are certainly on point. How does it show any support for those big genocide claims?

PS many of those things which are mentioned in the video are based on the already mentioned few questionable sources. But that is besides the point.

&gt; https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53650246

How does it prove genocide? And again Adrian Zenz is used as an authority. Super strange that he seems to be the only authority which is always mentioned.

&gt; We have also videos of reporters that Chinese officials led on tour where you can clearly see how things change and are moved comparing with the satellite images.

How is that evidence for a genocide?

&gt; Falun Gong are a psycho sect that doesn't mean China is not an horrible totalitarian regime looking for Sinacization of the whole area via ethnic cleansing. Thing that historically China has done over and over again.

It does not mean that. But strangely the main sources seem to be Falun Gong associated sources, Adrian Zenz or the already mentioned World Uyghur Congress. All others sources are basically the best example of [Citogenesis](https://xkcd.com/978/), where basically articles cite other articles which cite other articles which down the line mainly cite those three main sources.

And the sources which do not come from them are mostly about misconduct etc.

I'd be very surprised if you could find articles which do not talk about stuff which were claimed by Falung gong associated source, Adrian Zenz or the World Uyghur Congress. Not articles which simply talk about the misconduct, but actually prove those big claims.

&gt; HK is a part of China where Chinese government has no authority. They have different language, Chinese people need a VISA to access, own Parliament elected own laws and Chinese money are not even fucking accepted as currency.

It's still weird to call it an invasion.

&gt; Your stance on Tibet is the more imperialistic bullshit I've ever read. 

It's more like according to your logic, one could argue to divide China up into all the de facto states which existed in around 1920. You can surely do that, but just pointing out how ridiculous it sounds with the context.

You can argue that China doesn't allow for separatism, yes. That is true. And you can be against that. But talking like China reannexing Tibet was something special is rather misguided. China re-annexed many de-facto independent states, which were formerly part of China, but which got de facto independence because of the civil war and because the invasion of Japan.

&gt; It's like UK will attack US and India because they have been just briefly indipendent. So it's practically still UK. Sounds like the 5 second rule of things that drop on the floor with countries.

Yes, that is how things work. The independence of India and the US were bilateral agreements. Unilateral agreements are usually more messy. Europe has many of those, look at Kosovo, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Northern Cyprus, Transnistria etc.

According to your logic, Georgia has lost their claims on Abkhazia and South Ossetia forever. Cyprus has lost their claims on Northern Cyprus forever. Serbia has lost their claims on Kosovo for ever. Moldova has lost heir claims on Transnistria forever. Even Ukraine can be said to have lost their claim on Crimea for ever (especially considering it was and still is popular and they did have technically a unilateral declaration of independence). Similar how back then China has lost their claims on Tibet. And saying anything contrary to that would make you an imperialist (at least if you are consistent).

If you genuinely consistent, then I kind of disagree, but I admire at least your consistency. However, something tells me, that you will find justifications to tell me that Serbia lost their claims on Kosovo and China on Tibet, but not the other countries (because that is the mainstream opinion here).

6212,"Well, as a moscovite i find it pretty weird that foreign media just keep and keep multiplying the numbers of people in the streets.

 As a person who has been a part of those movements through the 2010s, I can agree with the older ones that we had muuuuuch more people in 2017, even more in 2013-2014 and the biggest stuff was happening in 2010-2011.

I am pretty sure from what I've witnessed the majority of people who went out today do not really care about politics and economy and just came there to take selfies, get likes on social media, and then safely go home. 

Personally, I believe those people are being tricked that they are fighting for their rights and the future of their kids, but in reality, they just help the Anti-Putin Kremlin team, just as corrupted, yet not as influential to overtake the power and rule the country.

Also speaking of Navalny, he has also been a really shady character, involved in a lot of corruption cases as a lawyer and as a politician during his first 10 years of his career.

Sadly, his zoomer fan base does not even want to investigate or research their idol, everything that can possibly put some shades on their leader is getting claimed to be lies and propaganda.

Second, Europe had way more diseases thanks to living in close quarters to animals for centuries, thus giving diseases better chances to jump from animals to humans. Because we had animals here that lend themselves to domestication, which they didn't have in the Americas. 

That's why European diseases wiped out whole populations in the Americas, while the same did not happen the other way around.

6479,"&gt;Are you implying you know better than economic researchers from one of the most prominent Economic Institutes in Germany? They probably spent months if not years researching that report. You are just being ridiculous now. Provide your credentials &amp; publish your government commissioned research paper and I might take you seriously.

Even they are just mere humans who have to pick some assumptions to make in order to be able to make a prediction about future gas demand at all. I question one of these assumptions and I say why. So please engage with that argument instead of puffing yourself up and playing the authority card. Or get the answer from the researchers why they think continued coal use is better than a switch to gas.

&gt;From logical standpoint, nobody will built new gas power plants just for transition alone. You use infrastructure and coal plants you have already and reduce the dependency over time. But then again I am not a scientist and energy expert with 20 years of experience and relevant education. I am just Computer Scientists. So I base my opinions on scientific papers from experts and don't pretend like I know better because I don't.

We will be using fossil fuels for electricity for some decades. That's enough for a new gas plant to be profitable still. I actually don't even think it's possible to keep coal plants open, they spew so much carbon dioxide that we would have to make extreme cuts in transport etc. just to allow them to keep running.

And that's just assuming we'll only run them on fossil gas. We'll probably start to syntesize gas or get it from another renewable/carbon neutral source, which means those very same gas plants can keep doing what they in the electricity network, but with a renewable source too.

Remember, if we say goodbye to gas completely, we'll have to write off the entire gas network. That's going to be much harder than closing down some coal plants a few years earlier than expected.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/l2medh/usgerman_tensions_over_russiabacked_nord_stream_2/gkgdsq2/,silverionmox,1611439789

6751,"Little histroy background:Medvedgrad (Beartown) fortres

On the southern slope of Medvednica, at the top of the hill Mali Plazur, nests a picturesque medieval castle which has been watching over Zagreb for eight centuries.

It was built in 1254, after the catastrophic invasion of Tatars who had raided and devastated this area, burning and razing to the ground the two settlements which later became the city of¬†Zagreb: the burgher‚Äôs Gradec and the bishop‚Äôs Kaptol. Although built in order to protect the burghers, the bishop and the ecclesiastical treasure, castle Medvedgrad commanded such a perfect strategic site that it was perpetually in the centre of proprietary and political turmoil. In its history it changed many lords, who¬†won or lost it through marriage, purchase and sale, intrigue or even plotting. The most notorious of them were the counts of Celje, who in the mid-15th century terrorized the town to such extent that many townspeople of Gradec had to flee from their homes. Even today the scary stories about the countess Barbara of Celje ‚Äì the ill famed Black Queen ‚Äì circulate about the villages at the foot of the mountain.

Medvedgrad was abandoned in 1590, after the fortress was devastated by a terrible earthquake **(Actual in 2020.)**, and its last lords moved to their much more modern and comfortable manor in ≈†estine.

Since then the castle at the top of the hill has been left to decay. It was visited only by adventurers and treasure hunters, searching for the treasure which, according to lore, was hidden there by the Black Queen.

The systematic archaeological research had started only in 1979, and since then the walls have been conserved and some parts of this best preserved Croatian medieval castle have been reconstructed. Thus from the ruins emerged again the octagonal chapel of St. Philip and Jacob, the south defensive tower, the residential palace and some other parts of the ancient fortress.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/l3eqbp/medvedgrad_fortress_watching_over_city_of_zagreb/gke8cru/,Toma357,1611417949

Finns tried to assimilate the Sami in ways I find unethical. (In the USSR / Russia this was much much more brutal, I don't know how it's been in Sweden or Norway, to be honest, but the stuff I've heard in my home country is unacceptable). I live in the most south-western part of Finland and I've visited Finnish and Swedish Lapland during backpacking trips, seeing some Sami people, the landscapes, and reindeer.

The Kvens (kveenit) are, if I remember right, ex-Finns who moved to Norway during a period where people were dying of starvation in Finland. I really don't think about them all that much. Just like in so many other examples, the ones who moved abroad in a crisis, ended up having a bad reputation where they moved. Booze and violence, primarily.

Karjalaiset: my great uncle was born in Karelia. He moved to southwestern Finland after WWII as his home area was taken by the Soviets, and even after living here for nearly 60 years, he still primarily spoke his Karelian accent/dialect, as was usual for people from Karelia (Karjala in Finnish). People who have visited Russian Karelia after WWII have told the place looks pretty nasty, with lots of neglect and poverty.

Extending it under these conditions while we have some people that thanks to political favours ""serve"" at their home is outrageous and very unpopular amongst young people that are being directly affected.

In fact, this would be seen as outright chauvinism directed against their sovereignity and freedom.

Ukraine's Euromaidan was a completely understandable course of action for a country that was visibly lagging behind its neighbours. The former model was just not leading them anywhere. Trying to pretend it was all the West's making is just as ridiculous as claiming current Belarusian protests have been started by the West, or in fact, any protest in the former Soviet world being some sort of an ""Western-organised colour revolution"" according to Moscow because who wouldn't be happy with the corrupt cleptocratic dictatorships that have ruled for 30+ years there, right? Coming from another ex-USSR country, most of the ex-USSR is a failed shithole with shockingly low level of governance. Extreme cult of personality, politicial mafia, complete disregard for human rights, you name it, it's all there. Having uprisings there from time to time is to be  expected. This does not guarantee success for the country, but nevertheless doesn't render the protests as somehow foreign-organised or illegitimate.

Again, money should not be an issue here. How much does it cost to lock down the European economy? Even if we spent a few 10s of billion backing a few wrong horses, in order to also back some more winners that would have been the better way to go. I'm as pro European as they come, but it seems to me there was too great an emphasis on cost here.

One rationale that has come up in a prior conversation about this on the sub is that people are not typically prevented from entering a country of which they are a citizen, so dual nationals can still move fairly freely between the countries in which they hold citizenships, as I understand it.  Same thing for people with single citizenships just traveling to return home.

At least in the US, I know that at least once a citizen is at the border, it's unconstitutional to prevent entry.

7280,"That data has long been out there.  It's cheap to put satellites up, and lots of people have put together world maps and satellite imagery databases.

There's a company in the US called [Planet Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Labs).  They image all of the non-water areas on Earth.

&gt; Planet is able image anywhere on Earth‚Äôs landmass on a daily basis, at 3 - 5 meter resolution.

They keep a history of images.  You can buy a past daily history and see things change over time.  People data-mine this.

And that's just publicly-available commercial imagery.

https://www.npr.org/transcripts/566713606?storyId=566713606

&gt;R. SMITH: With our satellites? They do use satellites. So a lot of the things that she showed me - you have to get close to the pipeline or the power plant in order to get the secret info. But satellites have allowed them to monitor everything everywhere. We walk into this huge room, and there's all of these different desks. And everyone is watching different commodities around the globe.
&gt;
&gt;So shout them out. What's over there?
&gt;
&gt;UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Oil.
&gt;
&gt;R. SMITH: Oil is over there.
&gt;
&gt;ALPHENAAR: Power.
&gt;
&gt;R. SMITH: Power - electricity. Hey.
&gt;
&gt;ALPHENAAR: Shoutout to power folks. Ag - corn...
&gt;
&gt;R. SMITH: Soybeans, maybe.
&gt;
&gt;ALPHENAAR: Soybeans. We have a soybean monitoring product.
&gt;
&gt;R. SMITH: So the people in this room are looking at the pictures from Planet, from satellites exactly like ours. And they're turning them into information that people pay money for. So one researcher we talked to is tallying satellite images of oil wells being drilled in South Sudan. Another one shows me the smokestacks from a power plant in India. He can tell exactly, like, at what capacity it's running at. And then Deirdre asks her team to show me their newest secret spy trick. It's like something out of a movie. Marcus Waldner and Brent Sundheimer open a window on their computer. Click. Click. Click. I see something that looks like a shipping port as seen from space.
&gt;
&gt;So what are we looking at here? Is this an actual place?
&gt;
&gt;UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Yes. This is a port in China, Dalian.
&gt;
&gt;R. SMITH: Click. Click. We zoom in, and I see what looks like a bunch of white marshmallows - oil tanks.
&gt;
&gt;And you can see in this photo how much oil is in each tank?
&gt;
&gt;UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Correct.
&gt;
&gt;R. SMITH: No, no, no. I want to see that. Where is it?
&gt;
&gt;A few more clicks, and, all of a sudden, there are little numbers laid over each tank. The computer has taken satellite images, looked at the shadows on the roofs of the tanks. And the roofs for these oil tanks are floating, so they go up and down, up and down. The computer looks at the shadow, calculates the angle of the sun and can tell you the height of each roof.
&gt;
&gt;UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: And then as we go through everything that the algorithm has analyzed, we can see every tank's fill.
&gt;
&gt;R. SMITH: So this says 17.5 percent full of this tank in China that you've never seen in your life.
&gt;
&gt;UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Correct. Well, I've seen it through satellite imagery.
&gt;
&gt;R. SMITH: Of course.
&gt;
&gt;Genscape just launched this service, a daily news feed telling customers how much oil there is stored in China. And even though it's based on Planet's satellite photos - satellite photos like the ones we will take - it is the analysis of the data. It's the way they cut it and use it and market it. That is what is making the money. And the service has been a hit. Oil companies, shipping firms, commodity traders can use these numbers to make decisions. When the oil tanks get low in China, you can literally start to send oil-filled ships across the Pacific before China even asks for it.
&gt;
&gt;It seems like the logical end to this is that, someday, any time there is an additional well, an additional ship, an additional tank somewhere in the world, we're all going to know about it.
&gt;
&gt;ALPHENAAR: That's right. Yeah. We're all going to know about it. And we're probably going to know within the day. And this is just one supply chain.
&gt;
&gt;R. SMITH: It's just oil.
&gt;
&gt;ALPHENAAR: Yeah. It's going to be the same for all commodities. But it's also going to be the same for how many new homes are being built, how much more traffic are on the highways...
&gt;
&gt;R. SMITH: Avocados. Soybeans.
&gt;
&gt;ALPHENAAR: ...How much more avocados are being grown. Yeah, exactly.

I assure you, if you press most people on the issue they are not against asylum seekers. Their main worry will be the right wing claptrap about welfare costs.

And that is a exenophobic right talking point, trying to claim that if granted asylum these people will forever be on welfare and thus lead to increased tax burdens on the working population.

But their real worry should be, and in some unarticulated way is, the ""immigrant"" worker (usually they are not permanent residents, but will only remain for a few months at a time). This in that said worker can be in a position to undercut existing wages.

And this is where the mixing of asylum and immigration comes into play, as bluring the line between the two feeds on that worry about jobs and wages.

Nope, I don't. In the former Warszawa pact countries they have pretty much only socially conservative parties and pretty much all of them have at least one party that is pro the old system (e.g. Moscow-alligned state socialism). However my impression is that that is only on paper and in reality their policy is more accurately described as corruption and nepotism galore.

&gt; The Swiss People's Party also sort of fits the mold in that whilst they don't want to expand the welfare state, they are fine with maintaining it.

Very few parties say that they want to cut the welfare state and even then the SVP talks about stuff like furthering sanctions, benefits being too high and all that, they just try to wiggle around openly attacking the welfare state too much. The Swiss People's Party is a populist right-wing party across the board.

For words that can definitely be a thing since we paste words (nouns, usually) together to make new ones. Basically, in places where English puts several nouns in a row but separates them with spaces, in Dutch (and German too) we simply omit the spaces.

For example, what in English would be called a ""car factory"", in Dutch is called ""autofabriek"": ""auto"" (car) + ""fabriek"" (factory).

7463,"The word n-r wasn't a neat synonym for slaves. It came from a neutral descriptive term(s) for dark skinned people and the colour black, but because of specific historical and political developments it developed negative connotations and fell out of polite use. We can somewhat clearly trace the evolution of the term from neutral to negative.

The argument in favour of keeping *British Isles* is that its based on Classical and pre-Classical terminology, that it's only descriptive and that its origins were neutral. This can be applied to the n-r word which was neutrally descriptive, related to Classical-era words and only later became imbued with negative connotations. Would you argue in favour of keeping the n-r word despite the protests of African-Americans? Why, or why not?

Again, a little knowledge is dangerous. Bringing up geography, classical writers, Celtic linguistics, etc, is missing the most crucial moment in the conception of the modern term which was in the 16th century.

7505,"There was no European African colony with equity between Europeans and the native Africans. Most other African nations were not settled by Europeans to the extent that South Africa was and when African countries began fighting for independence post ww2, their small and transient European populations packed up and left. Angola and Mozambique had sizeable Portuguese settlements, but both nations had civil wars for independence, during which nearly their entire Portuguese populations returned to Europe or immigrated into South Africa.

So because South Africa had a large white permanent population that had completely lost its connection to its European home countries due to language change, the whites remained and the segregationist policies that had always existed were ramped up and expanded upon to brace and poise the white regime for the groundswell of black nationalism and desire for emancipation.

Since white people were the significant minority in South Aftica and numbered about 4 million, spread out thinly over vast territory, there was significant existential dread among white South Africans at the thought of majority black rule.

7507,"no, but you said that the Danes have as much of a stake in humanitarian issues as anyone else. And that's false.

Humanitarian issues, apart from diseases, do not happen in a vacuum. All humans and countries have the moral obligation to help others as best as they can, but the burden is not equally distributed.

Some nations, and therefore their population, owe to the world and those refugees more than others. In Syria and Iraq the UK and France for slicing up the Middle East with the Sykes Piquot line, the US and the UK for invading Iraq in 2003 under forged proofs and then leaving a trail of violence and anarchy that was filled by ISIS, Saudi Arabia for promoting Wahabbism in the muslim world (and the UK for promoting Wahabbism in Arabia in order to weaken the Ottoman empire). 

Just because those nations refuse to acknowledge the crimes and suffering they brought onto those countries, it doesn't excuse them and it doesn't make Denmark as responsible as them in alleviating the refugee problem.","Ein Tirol ist nicht genug, dem S√ºdtirol gebe Ich mein Vorzug",/r/europe/comments/l2r8ca/danish_prime_minister_wants_country_to_accept/gk9fhjm/,standy85,1611360007

7550,"&gt; The US has two big tent parties so there are plenty of socdems within the democrat fold.

While that is practically true they don't have any social democratic tradition like in Europe. In just about every European country you have a split between a soc-dem party and a conservative party. In the US the historical difference between the 2 parties is that the Republicans are the party of the industrial north and the Democrats are the party of the slave owning south. Obviously it's not like that anymore today but the Democrats are not a soc-dem party and they've never been one, it's just probably the best place to go if you're a soc-dem in America today (even though it's leadership will try to screw you). Even in a time where America was largely following social-democratic ideals (30's t0 70's), it was a cross party thing. Eisenhower and even Nixon expanded social programmes and didn't govern very differently from their democratic counterparts. And when Reagan came into office the Democrats changed too with the Third Way - which still dominates the party today. 

In that fashion I wouldn't know which US government people could point too that'd be woke and globalist. They never really had one and the ones you could argue about (like FDR) weren't woke.

What does the name have to do with the rules of the English language?   I did a 5 second google search and couldn't find any such rule.

There is no rule book that says this region has to be referred as anything.  I have no interest in what Romans or the Ancient Greeks called it.  It's irrelevant to the term now which is heavily associated with people from the United Kingdom. It causes confusion for people outside of the region and it annoyingly gives the BBC an excuse to claim successful Irish people as British (this happens a lot) and frankly its kind of offensive given that whole colonisation thing.

You can refer to your country as what ever you want.  What is arrogant is that you can think can force a term on country that is not within your jurisdiction.  For Irish people its Anglo centric and harkens back to being  colony of Britain.  Any knowledge of the  history of the two countries and you can understand why Ireland would rather not be associated with the term British.  Nothing wrong with being British but Ireland fought long and hard for independence.

At the end of the day no one can stop you from using it.  Its up to you to be respectful of your neighbours or not.  There are other terms you can use if you ever find yourself need to refer to the groups of Islands off the mainland of Europe but also need to exclude Iceland.

7732,"I mean, I wasn't denying that subjugating people isn't morally wrong, but morality and pride don't necessarily exclude each other. I think that there are mainly 2 things at play here for the high pride, and that is my opinion as a graduated historian and sociologist.

Firstly, the Dutch empire is seen as one based on the expansion of a trade network and dominating a region economically and not conquer it militarily, like what happened during the scramble of Africa. This is not necessarily a historical correct view, but it's somewhat true if it is compared with other European empires of the time. The trade angle is also heavily propagated by the educational and cultural system. Also, the fact that the Dutch really punched above their weight and became the main world power for a short time really leaves a lasting effect in the public consciousness.

Secondly, almost all descendants of former colonial subjects in the Netherlands are here because their ancestors were loyal to Dutch authority or though living under or in the Netherlands was preferable. This is especially true for people with an Indonesian background. There are almost no new migrants from Indonesia with different views, so being pro-Dutch is a leading opinion in this community. This is different for black (not the Indian or Indonesian) people from the Dutch colonies in South-America and the Caribbean: they are the descendants of former slaves, so they have legitimate grievances. This isn't really true for all people from these areas's though. I have talked with some of them about their family history regarding slavery for my study and most of them mostly care about their family's past, not slavery in general. But still, the people that do have grievances with the Dutch colonial past are from the western colonies, mostly from Suriname, the most marginalized colony, and are black (the most marginalized group).

8032,"It _does_ apply to Switzerland.

In Canton Neuch√¢tel, for years and years there were discussions to close one hospital and only keep one for the entire canton plus surrounding regions. Much drama was had, resulting of course in a popular referendum in which the people massively rejected the closing of the hospital. So instead, a lot of services were cut from it and transferred to the canton's capital, city of Neuch√¢tel, effectively slashing the institution from an actual hospital to a glorified clinic. 

Internally, politicians from the city of Neuch√¢tel were calling the people from the ""upper"" part of the canton ""entitled"" and out-of-touch because they wanted to keep their hospital. (I have a friend whose aunt was a Neuch√¢tel politician and he made fun of me for wanting to keep the hospital, citing what his aunt was telling him privately).

All nations have terrible track records in how they treated people. It's not something unique to colonialism, and it's not something that can't be rehabilitated. That, however, now depends on the people of those countries as they're no longer colonies.

&gt;Also what about India, Pakistan, South Africa or Nigeria?

That's a result of the efforts of decolonisation, not colonialism. What Britain, France, Portugal, and other colonial powers should have done is stay in those countries long enough to build the infrastructure and traditions that could support an eventual transition to democratic, independent rule of the native peoples. What happened instead was that these countries were abandoned at the behest of the United States, the UN, and the USSR as quickly as possible, leaving the now-independent countries without basic infrastructure or any preparations for independent governance. Congo and Nigeria, for example, at the time of independence had less than ten university graduates each, let alone the infrastructure to produce more educated people. 

Pakistan's case is purely self-inflicted though. Pakistan under Jinnah could've become the Turkey of the east if he had not unfortunately died, or if the country's leaders decided to follow Jinnah's plans and beliefs for Pakistan after his unfortunate death.

The citation of the Romanian number is a dead link and the UK number includes those in temporary accommodation. I would expect funding for affordable living would help those people massively. 

I would also expect more funding for mental healthcare to help the 30% of the street homeless (24% of the UK homeless) to get off the streets and also assist those suffering from depression as a result of being in temporary accommodation.

\&gt;  A lot of these people simply don't want to be helped or can't live a ""normal"" stable life.

Just like how the Dutch and English who moved to North-America (and who eventually formed the USA and who are responsible for e.g. the bad treatment of (American) Indians) do not feel like 'Dutch' or 'English' but as 'Americans with Dutch/English ancestry', the people who went and lived in South-Africa and practised racism rarely returned to the NLs so they feel like 'people with Dutch ancestors' rather than 'Dutch people'.

This is very much unlike how the Dutch Indies are treated, for there the power was in hands of Dutch who only lived there for years at a time before returning to the NLs; so the Dutch Indies were indeed controlled by the Dutch.
