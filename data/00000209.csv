Germany has been able to entirely replace the nuclear plants they have shut down, with renewable energy (and offset more fossil at the same time)

This makes nuke lobbyists angry, watching their pet industry circle the shitter

https://www.worldfinance.com/markets/nuclear-power-continues-its-decline-as-renewable-alternatives-steam-ahead

For example, in 2017 over 150GW of renewables came online, and nuclear lost 1.3 GW

https://energypost.eu/nuclear-power-in-crisis-welcome-to-the-era-of-nuclear-decommissioning/

""New nuclear capacity of 3.3 gigawatts (GW) in 2017 was outweighed by lost capacity of 4.6 GW. Over the past 20 years, there has been modest growth (12.6%, 44 GW) in global nuclear power capacity if reactors currently in long-term outage are included. However, including those reactors ‒ in particular idle reactors in Japan, many of which will never restart ‒ in the count of ‘operable’ or ‘operational’ or ‘operating’ reactors is, as former WNA executive Steve Kidd states, “misleading” and “clearly ridiculous”.""

So in 2017, renewables grew more than nuclear has over the last 20 years. 

All while renewables are 3x cheaper than nuclear https://imgur.com/a/mUiXbFE#7phgGFz

And renewable energy is growing faster now, than nuclear ever has, even during its cold-war-era weapons-industry-subsidized heyday.

No other nation has jumps like this, and that's because process improvement or social/cultural practice change hardly ever penetrate suddenly throughout an economy. 

But don't take my word for it, this [Irish report](http://www.competitiveness.ie/Publications/2016/NCC-Benchmarking-Irelands-Productivity-2004-2014-report.pdf) indicates what's up:
""While national accounts are the preferred source for productivity measurement, a caveat with the available figures from an Irish perspective is that they tend to be based on Gross Domestic Product (GDP)19, which can be particularly problematic for measuring economic activity in highly globalised economies such as Ireland. Revisions to the 2015 National Income and Expenditure accounts in July 2016 led to an upgrade of the 2015 GDP growth to 26.3 per cent and GNP to 18.7 per cent. These revisions, which are in line with ESA2010 and BPM6 methodology, are largely related to relocation of multinational companies to Ireland and the resulting larger net exports contributions. 

Various commentators have stated these revised figures are not reflective of actual economic activity taking place in Ireland. Instead, these developments reflect the statistical ‘on-shoring’ of economic activity associated with an increase in the size of the Irish capital stock arising from corporate restructuring and balance sheet reclassification in the multinational sector, and also growth in aircraft leasing activity. As a result, National Accounts data now include a very significant amount of activity carried out elsewhere, but formally recorded as part of Irish GDP and GNP. Consequently, metrics derived from these measures, such as GDP per hour worked require careful consideration, in particular when undertaking international comparisons.""

220,"&gt;I need to do that with whatever I have left after paying tax.

That's how it works for companies as well!

Expenses are tax deductible, because you only pay taxes on what you *earn* not on revenue.

But if a company invests, it's not an expense. It's a capital investment, and you can't deduct it from your taxes.

Most assets work like this, with the exception that they are expensed over time. The investment isn't teax deductible, only the deterioration over time is. So a building or a machine is bought with after tax money, just like you buy investments after you pay taxes. However they are then written off over time as the expense is realized in the accounts lowering the taxes due over time. This is fair as they really are expenses the company needs to earn money. 

The problem with Amazon is that our accounting rules do not really work very well for their business. A lot of their ""investment"" are just ongoing expenses, because it's just wages. All tech companies have this ""problem"" of underreporting earnings. The difference is that most tech companies have huge margins anyway, so you don't notice it. Amazon is also a retailer, so they operate with very low margins to start with on top of having this problem of underreporting real earnings.

256,"*no u*

Don't try putting words into my mouth, I never once defended Facebook's practices, just calling bullshit on the guy for wanting Facebook to be bankrupted and shut down. It's a stupid idea and there are far better realistic solutions that need to be considered before ""hurr durr I'm a genius for saying Facebook is bad and therefore should be shut down"".


What I said about the value and benefits that Facebook has brought is not wrong, they did provide a platform that was pretty helpful at **first**, but they did go off into the deep end of where a tech company shouldn't go. 

Facebook is probably going to get hit with a massive fine(could be a multibillion dollar fine + more from whatever other EU laws and regulations they broke) and at the very least you'll see Facebook being more careful with people's data.

Everyone(including your ""happy to put words into other people's mouths"" ass) keep forgetting that up until the GDPR Facebook has had 0 incentive to change the way they conduct business and operate. Pointing out that Facebook is bad isn't going to make your argument any stronger if you're going to blindly take a dump on anyone who might have something slightly less negative to say about Facebook. Facebook is a money making business, they could give less of a shit about what you think about their business practices unless there's a real financial or legal incentive to do so(**which I repeat again for the nth fucking time, they haven't**). Up until now the harshest punishment they had to face was a round of hearings from old, decrepit, out of touch, and bought out politicians which resulted in fuck all and only served to show how inept the legislative bodies of governments are.

People should definitely stop using Facebook, but it's like whenever people say everyone should stop using Youtube or Reddit or Twitter or Snapchat or any social media. Most of the time there is no real alternative to the features that ""X"" Social Media platform provides so you aren't going to see people caring or bothering to switch. There is no replacement for most of these platforms and numerous ones have popped up and then shortly died out because they are heavily lacking or turn into a shit hole like dailymotion or tumblr, or they get shutdown like Vine.

Facebook answers to its stockholders and so far they seem fine with the way shit is being run so you aren't going to change jack shit crying about how Facebook isn't transparent, or how Zucc is really a reptile, or some other inane misguided bullshit. Go complain to your lawmakers, they're the ones who can actually be bothered to create the necessary laws to prevent Facebook's shady tactics.",,/r/europe/comments/9oa8zv/despite_media_reports_and_facebooks_claims/e7udy37/,kashmoney360,1539652466

282,"Well, both the UK and EU have loudly declared that they do not want to see a border.  But it is unlikely to be the case that there is a persistent state of affairs where goods are going to move freely between NI and the RoI.

The UK will not want to divide the UK, and will not want the EU to write the UK tariff schedule.  Those are reasonable and credible red lines.

The EU will not want there to be a lack of customs on goods entering the EU.  They want to avoid smuggling into the EU, which will otherwise [be a major problem](https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-means-good-news-for-irish-smugglers/).  That is also a reasonable and credible red line.

So, one possibility is the RoI — which I assume is where the resistance to an EU-UK deal is, given that that's the party who cares about the situation there — agrees to a customs border.

Another is that the RoI blocks a deal with this demand.  In that case, after Brexit, the EU is gonna require the RoI to put up a border anyway, or leave the EU, because it needs one to avoid smuggling into the EU Customs Union.

So in pretty much any outcome other than ""Ireland leaves the EU"", which I strongly doubt Ireland is going to do, there's going to be the Republic of Ireland putting up a customs border.  And the RoI will probably be the first to do so.

Now you get into legal detail, and I'm gonna have to speculate based on how the parties have been acting.

Both the EU and the UK have steadfastly refused to endorse a border.  For the EU, my guess is that that probably amounts to the RoI telling Barnier that they will veto anything with a border, so it's probably really the UK and RoI disgreeing — the EU-26 would be fine with a border.  I recall various people on /r/ukpoitics talking about the RoI announcing that they'd do such a veto.  I never went out to track down the source, but I assume that to be the case, and it'd make sense.

There are a couple potential reasons for this.  Maybe it's just a matter of not wanting the political blame, as the border would be unpopular.  Maybe so, but that's a lot of fighting over a relatively minor issue.  My guess is that it has more to do with the GFA.

Putting up a border has generally been viewed, in discussion that I've seen, as a violation of the GFA, a treaty between the RoI and UK that also gives NI the power to cause the UK to cede NI via a vote in NI.

The RoI has been banking on changing demographics to ultimately acquire NI from the UK.

However, normally once a party to a treaty violates the treaty and has no intention of conforming to it, the other party is also free from its requirements.  Under the Article 60 of the [Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_the_Law_of_Treaties), to which both the RoI and UK are signatories, once one party to a bilateral treaty is in breach of obligations, the other has the right to terminate its own obligations under the treaty:

&gt;A material breach of a bilateral treaty by one of the parties entitles the other  to invoke the breach as a ground for terminating the treaty or suspending its operation in whole or in part.

So I'd guess that the intense fighting over the border is due to the prospect of the GFA being violated by the RoI in imposing a customs border and the UK subsequently terminating the treaty.

If Sinn Féin get an immediate vote, as they're demanding here, and win it, that becomes a non-issue, as the RoI can acquire NI via a win there.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9of4tb/sinn_féin_wants_northern_ireland_vote_in_event_of/e7uf301/,vokegaf,1539653510

You're going to have to define ""really dark"" for us, because if you think someone that describes himself as ""brown-skinned of mix race"" will fit in, in Southern Europe, then your skin-tone scale is very warped. Being darker than the Welsh doesn't make Greeks and other Southern Europeans ""really dark"" by any means.  They're still far closer to Northern Europeans than to ""brown"", even when when they have a summer tan.  This is easily verifiable by just looking for Spanish, Greek, or Italian TV programs on YouTube.

Violent incidents of racism against is Afghans or Pakistanis or Bolivians is extremely rare, but it's not unheard of, and discrimination can also occur.

309,"&gt;C02 is something we cant reprocess, is prohibitively difficult to recapture, has a global scope of effect at a level of significance ranging from ""catastrophic to apocalyptic"". Step out of your denial for just 1 second, if you think Europe is having migration issues, what are you going to call the situation when it hasn't rained in central Africa and east Asia for 20 years? Cause we are close approaching that scenario.

If we are close to that scenario, shifting to nuclear isn't an option either way, is it? If we were to drastically change policy, it would have to be due to evident catastrophes caused by climate change. As for now, water scarcity (the main issue we expect in areas of Africa, China, India) is mostly result of increased use of water and pollution of water, not climate change. Why do we ignore that? Why is everything bad expected to happen always explained through climate change, when there's other reasons for it? Not to mention that African and Indian population are still increasing quite rapidly, increasing even more the demand for water, while causing even more pollution. Europe should not be the one having to face the consequences of that.

&gt;Global Warming will negatively effect nearly everyone. Even if there is a shift in zones suitable for habituation it will be a world of extreme's wherever we go. Storms, floods and never ending forest fires are things we are already tasting in various parts of the world. This is not a zero-sum game. We are loosing and there is no winner.

Let’s repeat: Facebook is in trouble with EU laws not because it had a breach of security, as long as it can prove it tried to put security in place (hint: it has and it will prove it). The problem is how they handled the breach. Weeks to react to the first warnings from their security teams, failure to properly warn users.... 

Following EU laws isn’t difficult at all. They just failed at something that should be basic for any business in their field: listening to your security experts and doing some fucking customer relationship... 

So of course a business can thrive under GDPR. Most of it is actually pretty common sense (ask for consent, use your data for what they were collected for, have security in place, ... ) and very few are actually technical (don’t sell European datas to places that Europe deems not safe, for instance). Did you even read the damn thing before making such a grand standing statement? 

Seriously, being a jurist by trade, I’ve dealt today with ONE tax law of my country that was, by several order of magnitude, more complicated than GDPR. If they can’t handle GDPR, seriously, their lawyers suck and they should change them.

Btw, I don't understand British victim complex here. Do you think the UK is the only country with Eastern European migrants? Germany has more them. The economic benefits overall outweight the costs. And know this: the UK could have had way less Easter European migrants if the Blair government back then had done what Germany and France did: restricting access to living in the UK for several years after the countries became a member of the EU.  You know why they didn't? Because the British businesses said they needed the workers from Eastern Europe.

Here's what Babis said  on 2018/06/22

&gt;Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said Frontex, the EU's border management agency, should be strengthened to better deal with the challenges of irregular migration to the bloc.

&gt;**Babis proposed significantly bolstering Frontex's capacity by increasing staff to 10,000 people**. He added that he was in agreement with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on using Frontex to strengthen the bloc's external borders.

Fast forward to today. 

&gt; Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told a joint press conference in Warsaw with his Czech counterpart Andrej Babis.”These kinds of proposals are indeed on the table. But nothing can be accomplished without money,"" he added. ""We worry that more money for Frontex will mean less money for structural funds, less money for road or railway development.” Of the eastern European countries that joined the EU in the 21st century, Poland is by far the biggest beneficiary of the cohesion policy, having received annually around 10 billion euros ($11 billion) net in recent years.

467,"So, if you're in High Wage Country and you trade with Low Wage Country in an area where Low Wage Country does a perfectly-servicable job of making something, then prices for thslat good will fall off in High Wage Country, along with profits and then wages and jobs.  That's not a bad thing in terms of the overall size of the pie — trade is generally good.  In a market economy, you *want* wages to fall off in a field where you don't need labor until a sufficient number of people leave it.  The labor shifts that result from that are what results in economic efficiency.

Now, obviously if wages for someone drop, someone's going to be irked with the local effects.

The problem is that people tend to be much more aware of the negatives of trade than the positives.  That is, it's easy to see that someone's job is being eliminated, and they're scared about finding another job, or want everything to *just stay the same*.  The people who are benefitting are often very great numbers that benefit a small amount — hiring spread out across many industries.  So they're less-aware of the effects.

Someone put a lecture by Milton Friedman on YouTube thst I love linking, because it so nicely describes the point.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_FXt0eM

So NAFTA is scary if you work in labor-intensive assembly-line manufacturing in the US, because now you're competing with lower-wage workers in Mexico.  If you're a US lumberjack, trade with Canada looks scary.  If you're a Canadian dairy farmer, the barriers to US milk coming down look scary.   That trade makes benefits society on the whole, but it means that you're gonna probably have to shift jobs.  And the vast bulk of people who do benefit don't really mentally register the benefits.

Same thing in the EU.  You get people in British manufacturing or fishing or agriculture grousing about Polish workers, say.

I don't think thst it's correct to reduce it to ""the 1%"", but it is true that generally, if Wealthy Country does business with Poorer Country, that because you can slot *anyone* into lower-skilled slots in Wealthy Country, gains do tend to go to skilled workers, because it's easier to import a worker from Poorer Country or otherwise substitute his labor.

I think that the US does a great job on this in, say, the software industry, by aggressively pulling in high-skill workers and having MNCs open up foreign branches.  On the other hand, it does a bad job with medical doctors, which have worked to establish barriers to competition all over the US, even at thr state level, and thus fuck over the people who need to purchase their services.

Id say that trade doesn't really have that much to do with people who are *really* wealthy and invest wealth — they care about ability of capital to flow.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9ocp9p/trump_nobody_treats_us_much_worse_than_the_eu/e7twhf9/,vokegaf,1539636754

487,"I think the idea that the EU is on par with the USA is just wishful thinking tbh. 

In raw GDP it's on par but that doesn't matter much when the EU still doesn't lead the member states in terms of foreign policy and defense which is where the real hard global power is. Just look at those South-East Asian states. They're anxious living next door to their giant Chinese neighbour and subsequently are seeking American favour in diplomatic and materiel means. Even Vietnam which has reasonable historic suspicions about American activity is warming up to America. Why does any of that matter? Well they aren't seeking the protection of the EU. They know that the EU doesn't even have a unified foreign policy vision to counter the rise of China. They know that at it's best the EU could only produce a handful of air craft carriers to patrol their waters whilst the Americans have ten and counting. America is credible, the EU is credible only on paper. 

I think if the EU wants to be a global superpower it will require a whole paradigm shift in terms of thinking. You can't be looking eye to eye with America when there is no vision, no arms, no interfering foreign policy backing that up. And I just don't see European citizens voting for parties who will pass on the responsibility of foreign policy to Brussels, who will tax their citizens even more to fund the necessary armed forces to project the hard power across the globe.

558,"How the execution unfolded, from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llu%C3%ADs_Companys#Exile_and_execution):

&gt; Companys exiled to France in 1939, after the Spanish Civil War. Companys had passed up various chances to leave France because his son Lluís was seriously ill in a clinic in Paris. He was arrested in La Baule-les-Pins near Nantes on August 13, 1940, and detained in La Santé Prison. 

&gt; He was then extradited by Nazi German authorities to the Spanish government in Madrid in early September 1940 and imprisoned in the cellars of the headquarters of the Dirección General de Seguridad (State Security) at the Real Casa de Correos in Puerta del Sol. He was held there for five weeks, kept in solitary confinement, tortured and beaten, while senior figures of the Francoist State visited his cell, insulted him and threw coins or crusts of bread at him.

&gt; In a military trial which lasted less than one hour and lacked legal guarantees, he was accused of military rebellion and sentenced to death. During the trial Companys was defended by Ramón de Colubi, a young soldier who had fought the war on the side of the rebels. Surprisingly, Colubí defended Companys with courage to the point of receiving threats and risking his own life. Colubí asked Franco to pardon Companys, but was ignored. As a consequence of his role as defence attorney, Colubí was forced to go into exile. Víctor Gay Zaragoza, a Catalan writer found that Companys and Colubí were relatives. 

&gt; All these efforts were useless and Companys was executed at Montjuïc Castle in Barcelona at 6:30 a.m. on October 15, 1940. Refusing to wear a blindfold, he was taken before a firing squad of Civil Guards barefoot and, as they fired, he shouted 'Per Catalunya!' (For Catalonia!). He is buried at the Montjuïc Cemetery, near the castle. The cause of death was given as 'traumatic internal haemorrhage'.",Catalonia,/r/europe/comments/9obkd0/today_78_years_ago_catalan_president_lluís/e7tn9td/,JosepFontana,1539629474

669,"I have no answer that considered the current political system.

People have tried all colors of the political spectrum.
Very left leaning governments have caused pain just as much as very right leaning governments.

Inherently, I believe, that humans are not able to govern humans.

We are just too egoistical, to self sentenced.
And I don‘t mean that in an evil way necessarily.

For example the xenophobia that brings right-leaning parties into power (or has them get more % in elections), as seen in the EU, and if I understand from the news bites that I catch, in South America (Brazil) as well, is exactly that... fear.

Fear is not necessarily something evil, but it is a primal emotion.
You can‘t fault people for worrying about their job security, about crime...
They look to people that are different as the culprit and that is of course wrong, but the fear is inherently human, we all want to selfpreservate...

People always talk about democracy and elections and all that... but at the end of the day, only humans vote, humans that are scared, be it unjustified _or_ justified.

All I can tell you is, that the current system isn‘t working and that those in power are:
A) Keeping the power by being in bed with politics (f they aren’t one and the same)
B) Own the entertainment industry to keep us distracted
C) Own the news agencies to manage our fears and who we trust and distrust
D) Have most of the power when it comes to who employs and who is employed

Each one of these would be bad enough.
But...

Politics enable the powerful to bring their will into law.
-	Be it new tax laws
-	Employment laws
-	Healthcare
-	Incarceration
-	_Who can or can not vote_

Entertainment is everything:
-	It means that movies propagate certain ideas, ideologies and concepts that serve the powerful. Your country goes to war? Then have movies about wars that show it in a preferred light.. the Nazies used the cinema to that end and I have _no_ illusion that it is done currently as well.
-	It opens fantasies, like drugs, a world to escape to, so that the common people do not look at the real world but argue about super heros...
-	It creates cult like followings, idols that people can worship, problems that they can invest in... all stuff that isn‘t real... how can people have petitions about who is a good casting choice but be apathic about the fact that much of our clothing still is produced under quasi-slavery conditions

News should inform us:
-	They tell us narratives that are _at best_ heavily colored and _at worst_ straight up lies.
-	They again are used to push a narrative

Since the employment power is concentrated so much
-	People live under a defacto slavery, a slavery that is made tolerable. You might not see yourself as a slave but you _have_ to work, otherwise you can‘t provide for yourself. There is no „free market“ because hunger dictates your decision making. You don‘t decide your workplace the same way you „freely“ decide which shoes you buy.

These are just **a few** short things written up, that are IMHO currently happening.
To look at A and D in combination... the small man has to pay proportionally a lot taxes in comparison to the big guy, which keeps the small guy in his / her dependency (slavery - IMHO).

Who, honestly, could someone in the current political landscape, be it in the US or anywhere, truly **trust**?
These people are deciding whether a mother can care for their child after birth or whether she has to pay money, so that a stranger cares for it.
These are the people that decide how much of the money you made for _your_ time.
These are the people that decide whether we create energy industries that pollute the air for our children or whether our children **might** have a chance...
Do you honestly trust _anyone_ in the current landscape to do that?

I don‘t trust any human to do that... and that **includes** me... I couldn‘t possibly have the answers here...

Humans aren‘t capable to do it themselves and as long as one doesn‘t acknowledge that, one can only fail.

Look at something simple as the golden rule...
_Do to others, as you want others to do to you._

It would solve all our problems, yet it is applied less and less...
Society isn‘t moving _closer_ to the golden rule but further and further away... and as times become more and more difficult, people fear a lot more... rinse and repeat...

And again, I am not blaming people... we are who we are.
I am worried about stuff as well and I want to keep my relatively secure lifestyle as well... its not like I am the holy one here... I am just as much a human as everyone.

702,"&gt;This is in direct contradiction to what you have written above

no it's not. I see there are crimes, which is always bad, no matter who commits them. I don't see an indication that this is above average compared to Germans. Also immigrants that are committing crimes of course are not welcome (and are either put in front of a judge or sent back, depending on the severance of the crime), but that's not what the whole discussion is about. It's about denying ALL OF THEM refugee status. That is something I can't live with. We are one of the richest fucking countries in the world, no one here is hungry, everyone has a roof over his head (if he wants to) - we have a fucking obligation to help them! I know for some of you they are only numbers. I don't see them like that, I see human beings.

&gt;No-one fled to Germany in a rubber boat. They were safe in Turkey.

So? wouldn't you do the same if you have a better prospect than in Turkey? And let's be honest, the circumstances refugees find in Turkey are inhumane and not worthy of any living being.

I do understand the bitterness when you paid taxes all your life and then the medical community and every other organisation etc basically flips you off saying ""well if you can't prove you have pain you're not our problem"" and you won't even get treated for agonizing pain and get ridiculed and insulted and called a drugseeker even though you haven't even gotten any painkillers yet. You lose all you had, you're suicidal because of the pain and then on top of it get denied disability pensions to survive? It's fucked up and it's the reality for thousands.

Europes  (and other countries') medical community needs to give patients their human rights back and give them what they are owed. And treat them properly and not deny suffering if they can't immediately find a condition from their 20 year old textbooks. Keep up to date with medicine, it can't be that i as a patient have to educate and sift through tens of doctors to find someone to treat issues that happen to a quarter of the population!

Are we going to pretend that half of the population of Spain (even outside of Catalonia) isn't guilty of saying ""España es una mierda""

Yeah, and surely the context and tone in which that is said do not matter. It is one thing the cunado who says so at the bar, something else someone who is constantly and rabidly looking for excuses to demean spaniards. 

Ffs, his argument against the AVE to Galicia is not that it is not cost-effective, which would at least be reasonable, but that *galicians have no reason to want to travel to Madrid* (maybe he thinks we still are starving illiterate peasants). Yeah, when someone with that level of discourse says ""Of course Spain is a shithole"", I am going to understand it in a certain way.

960,"&gt;You go and live in a shelter, or part of the country where it's cheaper.

As others have already pointed out, there are not enough places in shelters for everyone who is homeless in Hungary.

If the state wants to get rid of homelessness, then the state should make sure that tax-money is used to make sure there are shelters and public housing/other social supports for people who get into this situation.

For comparison: I'm a country where the constitution guarantees everyone the right to housing (we kinda have to, winters are not survivable outdoors here). The social services will actually help pay for your rent if you cannot afford it, and will help in arranging emergency housing.

We've still got a few thousand (I think the figure is about 6000 (in a country of 5,5 million)) people who don't have a permanent residence. These are mostly people who are in said position because of mental or substance issues (these people often times do not wish to stay in the support apartments and often leave to the streets after winter, or just generally distrust officials too much to even seek help, or just don't know how) or simply because of their own volition (a big chunk of these are actually people living with their friends that simply have don't have a permanent/reported address because they choose to 'couch surf' instead of getting help from the state).

Which is to say: it's really hard to entirely get rid of homelessness, even if the state outright helps one to get an apartment, but what is certain is that simply outlawing homelessness will do exactly nothing to solve the issue.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/9o7mu9/as_of_today_homelessness_is_a_crime_in_hungary/e7std80/,ZenOfPerkele,1539600696

dramatic over population growth because they extrapolate

some kind of existential fear when they see the charts

* What are the scientific findings on ""racial"" differences applied to the real world?

Are there more significant traits which really make a difference in modern human societies?
* Are there measurable differences in intelligence, stamina, strength, social cohesion, empathy, etc. between genetically different populations? Is there any statistical evidence for supremacy of genetic lines?
* What about the people that are heavily mixed through thousands of years of migrations, which applies to basically the whole population of Eurasia, the new world and most of Africa?

1060,"No, that's the close to falling apart bit. We put a Canada style deal on the table from day one, but with the Irish backstop.

The DUP won't agree to that and they can oust the government. Ireland won't agree to a deal without it and they can veto.

This whole charade is was and continues to be little more than internal British power struggles playing out on the World stage.

First Cameron tries to make a play against UKIP by taking the wind out of their sails with a referendum on Brexit. This backfires massively and he resigns.

Then May takes over and plays the populist, invoking Article 50 and then using the upsurge in popularity in order to reaffirm the Tories position in Parliament. This fails miserably and she's forced in to a coalition and as a byproduct wastes some 3 months negotiating time.

She then takes her political opponents, Johnson and Davis an makes them foreign and Brexit secretary respectively, even though they lack relevant experience and the trust of their PM. They were used as political human shields, their careers being tied to May's Brexit policy so that they couldn't turn on her when things went wrong. This did not go as planned as they resigned, and they are now fighting May from withing the Conservative party.

Labor's Jeremy Corbyn threatened to torpedo any Brexit deal in order to force a new election he hopes to win and then deliver a ""better Brexit"" a plan which, while it hasn't failed as of right now, is domed to fail because there simply isn't anywhere near enough time for the UK to have an election, a new deal to be brokered and then ratified by all 28 parliaments plus the EU parliament. And that's also on the assumption that Labor could win, which is not even close to being a given.

Then finally we have the DUP, the Northern Irish unionists. The fallout from May's snap election disaster. Their plan is to essentially hold the government hostage in order to make sure there can be no answer to the issue of the Irish border, thus making a hard Brexit very likely. This plan might work, but might end up being the biggest error in judgement, as a bad Brexit might be enough to push fro a successful Irish reunification referendum. 

And the EU is left on the sidelines, trying to negotiate in good faith (our negotiating plan was published 2 years ago and open for scrutiny and debate, our negotiator was ready and waiting on the day Article 50 was invoked, with his British counterpart David Davis, spent a grand total of 4 hours in the first 6 months of 2018 doing any negotiating before resigning in July) with people who don't care about Brexit beyond how it will help their political careers.

To take a very simplified exemple; imagine half the babies die in their first year, and the other half dies at 80 year old, the life expectancy at birth is a bit above 40 years old, but if you're 30 years old your life expectancy according to the actuary table is 80 years old.

I cannot read polish, but according to your actuary tables, it seems the life expectancy in 2015 for someone that is 60 years old is 19 more years for male (so 79 years old total), or 24,1 years for female (so 84,1 years total)

Saying that you could be right that some activist can find loophole to create situation where gay couple can register child in Poland.

This doesn't change my stance that judge should make ruling according to spirit of the law and prevent such outcome. They didn't have problems with similar approach in other cases. I can be wrong, after all I'm not lawyer problem is judges cannot defy will of sovereign and no, constitution is not one.

There are. That's what we call UN and it's function has been basically allowing RS to exist in return of it staying inside the BiH.

1214,"&gt; Most romanians have an extremely low standard of living.

Nope, many, yes, but not most. 

&gt;Timisoara and Transilvania in general is years ahead of Moldova.

Yes, that's true, but that begs the question, why? Moldavia has been getting more money from the state than it payed back since like forever. Even in the time of communism they got more money than they were worth. When people are fucking lazy, there will be no economic development. Whenever some investor wants to open some buisiness there, they are met with hostility and laziness, of course the region is poor as fuck. 

&gt;the majorty of the population is rural

No, the majority of the population is urban, that's statistics 101 fail on your part. 

&gt;(have you ever seen the difference between a western european village and a romanian one?

Yes. And again we come back to the problem of laziness and idiocy. Go to almost any Romanian village and the only place you are sure to find full, at any hour, on any day is the ""cârciumă"". Also, ever since the collapse of communism, they have refused to associate or modornize in any way, shape or form. I have driven across many European countries and I've yet to see one with so much uncultivated agricultural land as Romania. Furthermore, the land that is cultivated, is not cultivated intelligently, as they use primitive  techniques. Money has always been available, at least in the past decade or so, both from the Romanian government, as well as from the EU, they have no one to blame but themselves for not using it and refusing to modernize. Romania has the lowest absorption rate of EU funds ever, it's fucking ridiculous. 

&gt;You are probably born into an okay-ish family, went to one of the top schools in town and have gotten used to ignoring how poor the people around you actually are.

No I wasn't. I grew up poor as fuck, back in the 1990s and early 2000s even a bottle of Coca-Cola was considered a luxury in my family. Only since 2002-2003 my family's situation started to improve, but that was only because my parents were hard working so of course as the economy started to move, they started moving with it as well. However that doesn't mean I was given everything, pocket money was never a thing in my family, if I needed money I had to figure out how to make it myself. By the time I was 15, I had almost 1000€ hidden under my mattress when the majority of kids my age were still relying on the 10 lei or whatever their parents would be giving them. I've learned how to make money out of nothing then turn that money into more money at a time when most people knew only how to complain that they didn't have any money.

If the estimates turn out to be correct, the Lone Star State will be pumping almost 6 million bpd in 2019.

&gt;The Texas Gulf Coast oil terminals sent abroad more crude than they received in April, the Energy Information Administration [said](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=36932) this week. During that month, crude oil exports from the Houston-Galveston port district exceeded imports by 15,000 bpd. Over the next month, the advantage of exports over imports welled further, to an impressive 470,000 bpd.

The Irish military was a voluntary force in that there was no conscription, the men who joined were not forced into it, they made a decision to serve during a declared state of emergency and would have known the obligations that came with that. The 5,000 men who deserted the force during that period broke the oath they had made to serve the Irish state, and the position of the Irish government after the emergency had passed was that those men should not be trusted in any position within the public sector for a period of 7 years. The morality of that decision can be argued, and modern Irish governments have come to believe that it was the wrong decision, hence the formal pardon. But the key point I was making was that the often made claim that the Irish government punished Irish men because they had fought in the British army is false, the small minority who faced punishment did so because they had committed the crime of desertion.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/9o20l8/eamon_de_valeras_response_to_churchill_after_he/e7s3vsp/,TheGodBen,1539564179

As for your question, equality means equality, which includes nominal aspects as well. ""Civil Unions/Partnerships"" are just a cop out to placate people who don't like the idea of marriage being used for gay people despite the fact that a civil partnership is effectively a marriage in all but name. If this justification for having a ""separate but equal"" policy is valid, then so is any justification that anyone has to decry the validity of a marriage. There are plenty of people in the world who would not consider a marriage between two people of differing nationalities, religions, or economic backgrounds to be ""real marriages"" so why don't you see any support to make these kinds of relationships have a ""civil union"" instead of a marriage? The answer is simply the level on controversy. Most people agree that discriminating based off of race isn't cool anymore, but in many places gay people are still an ""acceptable target"" so they still have to deal with people trying to fuck with their personal lives because they make those people feel uncomfortable simply by existing and pursuing their desires.",,/r/europe/comments/9o2hv7/public_support_in_europe_for_samesex_marriage/e7s4d9r/,Porkadi110,1539564645

2. The 1937 and later 1959 constitution of Ireland set out the democratic framework that still forms the basis of our nation today so hardly anti-democracy. (not without it's flaws but we've improved it since)
3. We were the only new nation not to become an Authoritarian state in the 20th Century
4. Other than his relationships with the Irish Jews or becoming a Chieftain of the Chippewa tribe in the US, Dev also met with African-American activist Marcus Garvey &amp; Peurto-Rican nationalist Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos. He also condemned the Italian invasion of Ethiopia.
5. As for Extreme Nationalism - we may see differently on that front. However De Valera supported the right of self-autonomy even through violent means but the definitions i've found of Extreme Nationalism I've found in this case means to put one's nation superiority above others - something De Valera criticised colonial nations for doing in the speech in the original post.

1535,"&gt; For example, saying 'it isn't really true' doesn't inform me as to how the Irish state fell short.

Right you said 

&gt; Ireland was literally doing everything it could to assist the British (later Allied) war effort short of officially declaring war.

That's a ridiculously broad statement which seems pretty obviously untrue  

Surely you can think of something else Ireland could have done outside of straight neutrality which falls short of causing a declaration of war from Germany or declaring war itself 

E.g. to pick an easy example what about extending the air corridor to let aircraft fly over all or most of Ireland 

Or letting servicemen resign to join the allies instead of deserting

Or frankly any of a hundred things.  There are a great many examples of countries that played fast and loose with neutrality, Ireland didnt literally do them all

I think you meant Ireland did a lot or that other actions would have been less meaningful

&gt; There are not many Armies from which you can desert during wartime where the worst you will face is a loss of your pension and some job opportunities

I suppose I would counter that there are not many examples of genocide on the scale of the holocaust.

1588,"Completely agree with you, they should _rationalize_ their Capital Status indeed.

As a Spaniard, I think they should follow Madrid's example, from Wikipedia:

&gt;The creation of the contemporary Community of Madrid was preceded by an intense political debate. Since the 1833 territorial division of Spain, the main administrative division had consisted of provinces. Autonomous communities were to be created by one or more provinces with a distinct regional identity. Since the 1833 provincial organization, Madrid was part of the historical region of New Castile along with the provinces of Guadalajara, Toledo, Cuenca and Ciudad Real. Thus, it was first planned that the province of Madrid would be part of the future community of Castile–La Mancha (which was roughly similar to New Castile, with the addition of the Albacete) but with some special considerations as the home of the national capital.[5] The other provinces of the community of Castile–La Mancha expressed fears of inequality if Madrid were associated with them. The integrating provinces of Castile–La Mancha opposed such a special status, and after considering other options—like its inclusion in the community of Castile and León or its constitution as an entity similar to a federal district.[5]—it was decided that the province of Madrid would become a single-province autonomous community by virtue of Article 144 of the Constitution, which empowers the Cortes to create an autonomous community in the ""nation's interest"" even if it did not satisfy the requirement of having a distinct historical identity. Thus, in 1983, the Community of Madrid was constituted and a Statute of Autonomy was approved taking over all the competences of the old Diputación Provincial and the new ones the Statute considered. The Community of Madrid statute recognizes the Castilian association of the community, and its membership in the Castilian region. Several failed proposals have been made to alleviate the concentration of institutions in Madrid city by transferring the Community's capital to other towns, such as Alcalá de Henares, in the 1980s, and more recently, Getafe[6]

Also, their anthem is pretty much satiric towards its sheer existence as an Autonomous Region of the Country's capital:

&gt;I was in the Middle:
they were the others circle
and I was the Center.
Already the circle is broken,
already the people, make State
and here's vacuum turning
alone I am.
Everyone wants to be each one:
I am not going to be less:
Madrid, one, open, round,
autonomous, whole.
Look at the subject
turns giving the world
to stand still.
 
&gt;II
 
&gt;I have my body,

between Ávila and Guadalajara,
Segovia and Toledo,
province province
Flower of the desert.
Somosierra keep me North and
Guadarrama with Gredos;
Jarama, and Henares to the Tagus
They are the rest.
And at the expense of this
I am the last autonomous entity,
the pure and sincere.
Long live my owner!,
that only by being something
I am from Madrid.

And that is my desire,
that something is said
""from Madrid to the sky"".

As I like to say, Spain is, when it comes down to the political organization of the country a democratic feudal state, where you have to ask your ""supreme"" lord which protects you and so on (the Government in power) for rights for autonomy as long as it is not a power reserved Constitutionally for the State.",EUROPE IS UNITED NOW UNITED IT MAY REMAIN OUR UNITY IN DIVERSITY,/r/europe/comments/9o2m5l/countries_where_capital_is_not_the_richest_region/e7rxk4m/,makeredo,1539557959

It would be impossible for any nation to be reasonably expected to account for every instance, to balance each wholly toward one side, and then continue to be regarded as neutral by the other. Neutrality is not an island - it exists so long as *both* sides of a conflict are willing to allow it to exist. So yes, there may have been ways in which Ireland could have 'improved' her stance toward Britain; but remember - she would have to sell it as reasonable to the Germans too. Meantime, *every* assistance that was asked of her in secret was accommodated and more offered. In this light, Ireland was *literally* doing everything it could to assist the war effort short of officially declaring war.  

The Donegal Air Corridor is actually a good example - access was asked for in secret, access was granted in secret, and the Germans were none the wiser. Opening it up to the whole (or a greater part) of the island would simply have alerted the Germans to Ireland's alignment and would very likely have resulted in Irish shipping to Britain of vital foodstuffs being torpedoed.

You forgot about the colonial masters bit, seeing as it was the colonials, not the natives, who were in power  in all those countries. Notice that the one Commonwealth country where the *natives* were in power didn't sign up. If Indian independence had come a dozen years earlier, you can't see the likes of Nehru or Jinnah being too keen to come to the aid of their former rulers either. The Burmese went one step further and sided with the Japanese.

1913,"From a previous post of mine: 


The attitude, which still survives, of Britain and America towards Irish neutrality is actually pretty interesting, especially in that it is a largely manufactured one.  

The American ambassador to Ireland at the time was a Mr. David Gray. Gray was extremely atypical for American ambassadors to Ireland in (at least) one major regard: he thoroughly disliked Ireland and the Irish (the feeling was mutual) and was personally convinced that the Free State was all but a Nazi puppet regime. His theories and proposals were completely at odds with the OSS, MI5, and the British Admiralty. This is not to be surprised at, as Gray was in the habit of getting his own advice from séances.  

The reality of the situation was that Ireland was quite literally doing everything it could to assist the British (later Allied) war effort short of officially declaring war. Given the strategic situation in the early years of the war, and the limited usefulness of the antique (and southerly) Irish bases, Ireland was considered more helpful out of the war than in it.  

Ireland agreed that all communication to the continent would go through one cable - through Britain. After Ireland seized their transmitter, this was the German embassy's only remaining line of communication with Berlin, using codes that the British had already broken (meanwhile, the British were free to use their radio transmitters). Further, the German embassy in Dublin was busy sending a flood of information on British shipping, supplied by Irish 'supporters' who were themselves supplied by MI5. The British objected strongly to Gray's demands that Ireland close the embassy for this reason.  

Ireland's G2 shared completely with their Allied intelligence counterparts throughout the war. To counter Gray's machinations, the leader of the American's OSS, Gen. Donovan, wrote to Roosevelt to ensure that the true picture was kept in mind - 'The co-operation in intelligence matters offered and given by the Irish has been very full. It should be pointed out that we did not offer the Irish information in return and have given them little'.

Ireland's Lookout Posts also tracked German air traffic in the Irish Sea and Atlantic, which they transmitted in code via radio to Dublin. The British were secretly given the code, as well as being allowed to set up radar stations along the Cork and Donegal coasts, station observer sea-planes at Foynes, and station air-sea rescue boats in Killybegs. Further facilities were offered, but never taken up. To top all of that off, the Irish prepared a secret fall-back base in Tipperary for the RAF to continue to operate from in the event of an invasion of Britain itself.   

While spared from German attack, Irish food and manpower was free to move to Britain where it was desperately needed. Some 70,000 men volunteered for the British armed forces, while another 200,000 filled out Britain's war economy (while America, it bears noting, remained neutral also). These are huge numbers when one considers Ireland's working (male) population.   

So where does this feeling of animosity come from? It comes directly from Gray, and indirectly from a decidedly ungracious agreement between Roosevelt and Churchill.  

In 1943, at the height of the U-Boat threat, the Canadian High Commissioner to Ireland suggested that if Roosevelt asked for Irish bases, De Valera might say yes. Roosevelt ran into strong opposition for a genuine request to Ireland to officially join the Allied war effort from his State Department, the Chiefs of Staff, and the OSS, as did Churchill from his advisers. British top brass maintained that the Irish bases would be more trouble than they were worth, and dismissed the idea. 

Gray nonetheless seized on the scheme because he personally felt that De Valera would say no, and that would make him look bad. He went home to the US and explained to Roosevelt and Churchill a plan to publish a letter condemning Ireland for not turning over its naval bases in New York on August 14th of that year. They, in turn, thought it politically useful that De Valera be brought low in the estimation of Irish-Americans, to ensure he could not cause Anglo-American difficulties over the Irish Partition issue after the war. It was explicitly a propaganda effort for American consumption, as explained later by Gray in his own cover letter.  

The letter was duly published on March 10th, 1944 (when the bases were no longer needed anyway). It did huge damage to Ireland's reputation abroad - especially amongst its target audience of Irish-Americans. It also put paid to any hope of a resolution to the Irish border question, and solidified anti-Irish feeling in Britain and among the Unionist population of Northern Ireland.  

Churchill, ever the hawkish Imperialist, was delighted, and expounded upon the theme (while partially drunk) during his speech on VE Day where he congratulated Britain (i.e. himself) on not invading neutral Ireland and taking her bases by force - as he had directly threatened to do in 1939 when he needed someone else to blame for the loss of the Royal Oak at Scapa Flow (about as far from Ireland as it is possible to harbour your fleet anyway).  

&gt;  This was indeed a deadly moment in our life, and if it had not been for the loyalty and friendship of Northern Ireland we should have been forced to come to close quarters with Mr. de Valera or perish forever from the earth. However, with a restraint and poise to which, I say, history will find few parallels, we never laid a violent hand upon them, which at times would have been quite easy and quite natural, and left the de Valera Government to frolic with the German and later with the Japanese representatives to their heart's content.  

(*It bears mentioning that Ireland did not commence any diplomatic relations with Japan at all until the mid 1950's.*) 

It is a sad lesson in propaganda that the same bitter message is still put about today. In response to Churchill's bravado, De Valera himself put it best:  

&gt; I would like to put a hypothetical question-it is a question I have put to many Englishmen since the last war. Suppose Germany had won the war, had invaded and occupied England, and that after a long lapse of time and many bitter struggles, she was finally brought to acquiesce in admitting England's right to freedom, and let England go, but not the whole of England, all but, let us say, the six southern counties.

&gt; These six southern counties, those, let us suppose, commanding the entrance to the narrow seas, Germany had singled out and insisted on holding herself with a view to weakening England as a whole, and maintaining the securing of her own communications through the Straits of Dover.

&gt; Let us suppose further, that after all this had happened, Germany was engaged in a great war in which she could show that she was on the side of freedom of a number of small nations, would Mr. Churchill as an Englishman who believed that his own nation had as good a right to freedom as any other, not freedom for a part merely, but freedom for the whole--would he, whilst Germany still maintained the partition of his country and occupied six counties of it, would he lead this partitioned England to join with Germany in a crusade? I do not think Mr. Churchill would.

&gt; Would he think the people of partitioned England an object of shame if they stood neutral in such circumstances? I do not think Mr. Churchill would.

&gt; Mr. Churchill is proud of Britain's stand alone, after France had fallen and before America entered the War.

&gt; Could he not find in his heart the generosity to acknowledge that there is a small nation that stood alone not for one year or two, but for several hundred years against aggression; that endured spoliations, famines, massacres in endless succession; that was clubbed many times into insensibility, but that each time on returning consciousness took up the fight anew; a small nation that could never be got to accept defeat and has never surrendered her soul?

#######  

As for signing the book of condolences:  

In response to vitriolic international criticism over his gesture, De Valera insisted it was a question of diplomatic protocol and that failing to send his respects would amount to ""an act of unpardonable discourtesy.""

In a letter to Robert Brennan, the Irish ambassador in Washington, De Valera wrote: ""During the whole of the war, Dr. Hempel’s conduct was irreproachable. He was always friendly and invariably correct -- in marked contrast with [U.S. envoy David] Gray. I certainly was not going to add to [Hempel's] humiliation in the hour of defeat.""  

He certainly knew that doing so was not going to look good - his own ministers begged him not to - but the protocol of the thing would have been too much for De Valera to ignore, being as he was such a stickler. He also specified that his actions in no way condoned the policies of Hitler's regime. ",,/r/europe/comments/9o20l8/eamon_de_valeras_response_to_churchill_after_he/e7qz4xq/,theoldkitbag,1539528129

1924,"I just read a really interesting summary essay by sydney aster on the historical debates around appeasement 'Appeasement before and after revisionism' and broadly what we are articulating is the 'guilty men' and 'revisionist' sides of the argument. 
From what i read, essentially the broad weight of evidence tends to back that the 'guilty man' view of him tha as guilty of making a huge misjudgement, personally bullying and advocating for his position across dissenting opinion, from colleagues and others and of seeking to influence the press. 
There is some consensus that Munich did buy time for rearmament, but this is balanced by a lack of early efforts to rearm and of lack of persuing balancing alliances which could have worked, especially a grand alliance with ussr and france. 
One interesting take for me is that chaimberlain and others appeared more concerned with the spread of communism, and indulged nazi germany as prefereable to communist free reign in eastern europe. This, it is argued, lay at the core of abandoning a policy of checking hitler when it wouldve been effective earlier on. Really interesting stuff.

TLDR: this stimulated further reading, you are right, i was wrong - although their are way more factors involved than disccussed. 

p.s I love that reddit has stimulated me to go out and learn more i this area. Thanks!

""War Resisters' International (WRI) works for a world without war. We are a global pacifist and antimilitarist network with over 90 affiliated groups in 40 countries. We remain committed to our 1921 founding declaration that

'War is a crime against humanity. I am therefore determined not to support any kind of war, and to strive for the removal of all causes of war'.

All wars, including wars of 'liberation' and 'humanitarian military intervention' are used to serve some power ­political or economic interest. All war leads to suffering, destruction, and new structures of domination.

What we do

WRI is primarily a network of organisations, groups and individuals. We facilitate mutual support, by

Linking people together through publications, events and actions

Initiating nonviolent campaigns that actively involve local groups and individuals

Supporting those who oppose war and who challenge its causes

Promoting and educating people about pacifism and nonviolence

From the WRI office in London, we run three programmes of work that are important to the network. They are The Right to Refuse to KillProgramme, the Nonviolence Programme, and Countering the Militarisation of Youth.""

That works both ways.

In this case we already have the ideal result. Ireland didn't need to lose its self-rule and individuality. Given that Ireland was found much later to have breached neutrality to help the Allies (Donegal Corridor, allowing British pilots and sailors to return to Northern Ireland) you can even say that they did help.

It was only in open conflict that Ireland stayed neutral, willing to help both  Axis and Allied ships when they were in trouble, and suffering attacks from both sides because of it.

I think you're wrong on this. It was quite simple, it was a vote to decide whether Britain remains a member of the EU or not. 

If you followed the debate in the country than you would realise that numerous scenarios were presented before the vote took place of what could take the place of current EU membership. 


&gt;And the UK still seem to be operating under the illusion, that it can stand outside the EU with its own rules, while the 27 others have an agreed set and the ECJ. 

Most countries in the world do this. 

And funnily enough Britain is among the best EU member states for following the rules enforced by the institutions of the EU. The big rule breakers are Germany and France.

2011,"&gt;The thing is, you don't have to go out there and say outright **""Germany did nothing wrong""** when your party and constant statements very much make it clear that you **dissaprove of the current dealing with WWII in Germany**

Are those two seriously the same thing? Is it not reasonable to say that a) Germany did plenty of wrong and simultaneously b) the amount of guilt and self loathing that is inflicted on the country is counterproductive in many ways? It doesn't mean the entire project of reconciling the the past should be done away with (I disagree with the idea of 180 degree turn) but you can make certain changes where you acknowledge the past while still having a healthy sense of patriotism.

&gt;Let's look at Björn Höcke, the dude who claimed that we should have a ""180 degree turn around"". In the same speech he also called how we deal with WWII ""dämlicher Bewältigungspolitik"" (more or less meaning ""dimwitted coping/overcoming politics"") as well saying Germans are a ""brutally defeated volk"" and that German history was being ""made miserable and fun of"". 

That kind of sounds like what I'm saying. I don't see what's so self evidently wrong with that, I think you're just reading the worst possible interpretation into it (which isn't automatically wrong, like I said, the guy *might* be a nazi, I don't know but it doesn't mean this statement is wrong at its core). Germans are trying to do the right thing but it's in some ways dim witted if you got yourself in a position where nobody wants to join the army because the idea of wearing a German uniform disgusts them. It has to be possible to deal with your past without destroying a sense that your nation is worth defending. 

&gt; and how we have to look at what happened and remember it so we can prevent it from happening again.

And if your way of doing that means you'll be hypersensitive to anything that sounds even remotely nationalistic, you'll have a massive blind spot and will reject legitimate ideas out of irrational fear of ""it"" happening again. I'm not saying you should completely turn off those danger sensors but if they're tuned unreasonably high, you end up making mistakes. 

It seems to me that anyone who points out that there's something wrong with the way Germany is dealing with WW2 is immediately put into ""must be a nazi"" category without acknowledging that one can hold that position while not being a nazi or even right of center. There needs to be a way to deal with the past that doesn't destroy the future and it seems like there are serious flaws with the current way and it's impossible to talk about it. I see Germans' unwillingness to join the army and resist unchecked immigration as a consequence of thinking of their country as not worth defending and it has a lot to do with how you deal with your past. That doesn't mean I want Germany to be like Japan and sweep history under the rug or rewrite it but there has to be some kind of healthy balance.

Politics:

\- **We're still waiting for the cabinet reshuffle** (following the resignation of our Interior Minister). It's been delayed by a week.

Last week I reported on the fact that yet another Minister had resigned from Macron's government: Mr Collomb, Interior Minister, who prefers to go back to his role of mayor of Lyon. \[He could have thought about that before accepting the position; he didn't\].

His successor was supposed to be announced on Monday or Tuesday - along with several other changes in the Cabinet (according to credible rumors). So we waited all week but finally it *should* be announced tomorrow or on Tuesday (with a one week delay). 

Why this delay? Why is it taking longer than usual? We don't know for sure because Macron and his entourage are all saying everything is fine and he's just taking his time selecting and vetting people for important positions. BUT this delay might well illustrate the fact that Macron is having trouble finding people willing to work with/for him. He created his party out of nothing, on his own name and when most Frenchies were unfamiliar with him; he succeeded splendidly and managed to convince hundreds of people to join him and be elected as MPs. But now, things are getting more difficult, his approval rating is low, several of his ministers resigned and it seems that he is having trouble finding and convincing  qualified people to join his team. 

There's also the fact that, being a ""centrist"", he is trying to pay attention to the balance of the various political leanings in his government. While his right-wing Prime Minister may not be willing to make such concessions. \[It's likely that the ""left-leaning"" personalities they contacted refused. And maybe the right-leaning ones that are willing to accept aren't qualified or are too conservative\]. 

Wait and see. We are expecting to have a new Interior Minister,  other new ministers at the Agriculture, Culture and ""Regions"", plus possibly brand new Secretaries of State.

Še bolj množično se milo pojoče ptičice pojavljajo na menijih prestižnih restavracij – le znati jih je treba naročiti, pripomni Jančar.

2151,"&gt; It seems to me that we neither took too much land early on nor occupied anyone. 

If there's one sin Europe committed, it wasn't that.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_colonialism

&gt; in ever having enough land and resources for our advanced economies to function

I really don't think that a lack of *leibensraum* is the major limiting factor.  Economies are more disconnected from resource extraction than they've ever been.  Russia has shit-tons of land and look at her.  Human capital is where it's at, more than ever.  The wealthiest-per-capita parts of Europe are the dense ones.

&gt; I think Europeans deserve land redistribution from purely the perspective of not having much left.

[Asia approves of this redistribution concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population#Population_by_continent).

Well, there's emigration to low-density countries, which would spread out land and people more-evenly.  But I assume that your aim is more increasing the clout of people who continue to reside in Europe.

I dunno, the UK has a bunch of people gung-ho on that CANZUK thing.  That'd be a move towards one country.  If it truly goes forward, it'd slash her population density.

&gt; But due to our history and our meekness we are at the mercy of others now. 

What, like, China,  India, or the US?  How much meekness are we talking?  India was under control of the UK, China under the influence of the Brits and other outside powers, and the last big transatlantic spat had the Third Reich declaring war against the US (not, I suppose, without a measure of provocation, but…).

&gt; We can't keep ahead in services, education and stability forever, especially with the way globalism is functioning.

Relative positions have tended to weaken compared to the developing world, yeah.  But due to trade, that means that absolute positions strengthen.

&gt; our ability to function will be severely limited by our internal conflicts

The first article isn't a ""weirdo"" in a ""local election"" it's the LEADER of the whole goddamn party in the parliament who has been deputy leader of the party since 2015. He says we need to ""reclaim"" our history and that ""Erwin Rommel"" belongs just as much as von Stauffenberg. He combines this with a critique of how Germany is treating the past right now and saying we should be ""proud"" of the soldiers in WWII. Combining this with the general stance of the party, including former AFD chief in Thüringen claiming that the Memorial to the Murdered Jews is a ""monument of shame"" and demanding a ""180 degree turn around"" in how we treat WWII gives you a pretty good idea of the context these quotes are in. 

The link regarding the ""Hitler 'forced' to invade Poland"" which is blank far-right history erasure was done by the leader of the youth branch of the AFD in Lower Saxony (my state, sadly enough). The youth branches of the party are just as much a part of the party as the senior branches and some of their members can be quite influential during their time there (see Kevin Kühnert) or as a teaching ground for later high-level party members. Nahles, the current leader of the SPD, was also a state level head of the SPD youth fraction and later their national leader.

This has been going on since at least the 90s, especially after 9/11. It was boosted after the two attacks in 2016, things have been fine since then, but politicians are reluctant to ""reducing the security"" (doesn't really sounds good in a speech).

France has always housed a sizable African and middle easterner population, if you're wondering why then maybe search for what France looked like in the 19th century. Lots of colonies, very central and influential place in Europe.

From my personal experience people were just as disinterested as anywhere else. Most people would not know much about any programs or political positions, but rather voted for the people they knew or saw on TV.

Personally I am opposed to mandatory voting for two reasons. One, it hides the political apathy. If only 50% of the people turn up to vote, you know there's a problem. If it's 90+%, you won't until they vote for some kind of protest party. The second point is related to the first. If you don't have to motivate your electorate to show up, you are not incentivized to make voting convenient for voters. In Luxembourg, if you wanted to do postal voting, you had to motivate it in a reason to your mayor months in advance (changed now, but deadlines are still ridiculous). The election offices also closed at 2pm. In Germany for example voting is just so much more convenient. You can pickup your absentee ballots at your citizen center until the Friday before the election. You can even directly vote at your citizen centre before the election. Election offices are also open until 6pm.

2280,"DeepL automatic translation (1/4):

&gt; During and after the uprising Warsaw was robbed by the Germans.  Individual thieves and those who robbed by order.

&gt; In a tenement house on Wiejska Street, at the corner of Piusa IX, wealthy people lived.  On the second day of the uprising Gestapo men appeared.  One of the inhabitants reported:  ""The terrorized caretaker led them to the Piłsudski family.  The Piłsudskis, their housekeeper and 2 foreign ladies were present in the house, together 5 people.  Without any interrogation they were ordered to face the wall in the apartment and murdered on the spot.  The Chałupczyński family (3 people) were taken care of in a similar way.  In a few other flats the course of the incident was similar"".
The next day the Germans appeared again and ""the costly content of the murdered flats"" they took away.  Then a team appeared, which set the house on fire.
In the first days of August, Szczepan Grudzień observed 13 executions from the window of the tenement house at Bagatela Street in the Jordanów garden near the building of the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces.  ""On the third day I noticed that the convicts had to undress before being shot.  After the execution I saw the Germans burying in the clothes of their victims and taking away some found objects"".  Probably it was more pleasant to rob valuable objects from clothes and bodies splashed with blood than to brush the corpses of people who had just been killed.
Nearby, at Marszałkowska Street, future victims were also robbed before death.  Jan Łatwiński, who survived the execution, told the story:  ""The whole Lithuanian and Oleandrów streets were surrounded by gendarmes and SS men.  We were ordered to lie down on the ground [....] each time rings and watches were reviewed and taken away"".
Less than a week after the massacre of Wola inhabitants, when 35-50 thousand Poles died in just a few first days of August, SS and police general Heinz Reinefarth sent a gift to Heinrich Himmler.  ""Reichsführer!  From our Warsaw war booty I allow myself to send you two packets of tea with the best greetings.  Heil Hitler!

Their definition:

&gt; Personal remittances comprise personal transfers and compensation of employees. Personal transfers consist of all current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from nonresident households. Personal transfers thus include all current transfers between resident and nonresident individuals. Compensation of employees refers to the income of border, seasonal, and other short-term workers who are employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents employed by nonresident entities. Data are the sum of two items defined in the sixth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual: personal transfers and compensation of employees.

2316,"&gt;Several hundred people hit the streets of Paris on Saturday to denounce the findings of a new expert report into the death of Adama Traore, a young man who died in police custody in July 2016. The findings exonerate the gendarmes of responsibility for the death, saying his health was to blame.


&gt;SOT, Assa Traore, sister of Adama Traore (French): ""We have this last expert report that says my brother did not have a heart attack or infection but died of thoracic compression. But we have this conclusion that says that Adam Traore died because he had sickle cell disease. It should be known that sickle cell disease is diagnosed 15 days after birth and today we learn about it 24 years after according to these experts. They say he died running 480 meters in 18 minutes. These are all the inconsistencies we denounce in this expert report that wants to defend the gendarmes. We are being told a lie by the state that we want to denounce and say that it is false. We ask for justice and truth for Adama!""


&gt;SOT, Assa Traore, sister of Adama Traore (French): ""So this march is to say no, my brother did not have sickle cell disease, my brother did not die because he ran. He died under the beatings and violence of these gendarmes who killed him and let him die in this gendarmerie. We have the testimony of the firefighters, we know that the experts must have dismissed the testimony of the firefighters. The latter says that they did not help Adama, that they had to demand that he be removed from his handcuffs to give him first aid. So today we are here to ask that the truth comes out, that the gendarmes be condemned, and tell France to pay attention: a country without justice is a country that calls for revolt.""


&gt;SOT, Oumou Traore, Mother of Adama Traore (French): ""We are here because the expert report came out today. The fourth report. I thought I was in a country of law, the law means we must be told the truth. Since the beginning of this story, first, second, third, fourth different expert reports, it is that there is a problem somewhere, I would like to be told the truth, something I can understand.""",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/9o0tis/france_hundreds_demand_justice_for_adama_traore/e7qi76q/,mystery144,1539499620

The left is split. There are some groups that are anti-Israel in the same way they are in most countries, but they're not the majority of the left.

First of all the EU has no foreign relations.

France and U.K. have about the same relationship with KSA that the US does, and most other EU countries such as Germany just piggyback off of that (as in they have a rocky relationship politically but have strong military and economic ties.)

Israel has never had a great relationship with KSA but MBS knows that there's a lot to be gained by having a strategic anti-Iran partnership.

2586,"I ended up digging a bit there since I was *really* curious myself, it's not exactly something I had any knowledge about at all before this.

&gt;Why do you need a registry office which is exclusively responsible for keeping tracks of victims who died in concentration camps 1933-1945 which is funded three decades in advance?

Every death needs to be registered by law. Usually the registry office of the place where the person lived is responsible for certifying the death. In the case of people who died in concentration camps it would be both unreasonable and often times impossible to trace back where exactly the person lived before their death.

By assigning a single registry office for these cases instead of sending them across the nation and across borders to other nations it is all in one place and the people working there can be trained specifically on this topic.

&gt;Its now soon 80 years ago, surely no new information can surface regarding who was where.

We wish. First you need to keep in mind that it took until 1990 for former soviet archives to become accessible - that's 28 years ago. Documents *still* end up being found or need to be sighted, and Bad Arolsen is the central place in the world where you can try to put the information together.

Second German archive laws mandates a 100 year period when it comes to the public release of personal information. The special registry office works directly with the [ITS, the international tracking service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Tracing_Service) (which is located in the same small town) who are responsible for the archive side of things and are considered a part of the UNESCO [Memory of the World Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_of_the_World_Programme) since 2013.

They keep the *original documents* regarding victims of the Nazi-era and their inventory is so vast that it's highly likely not all information made it to the registry office yet:

&gt;ITS's total inventory comprises 26,000 linear metres of original documents from the Nazi era and post-war period, 232,710 meters of microfilm and more than 106,870 microfiches. Work is under way to digitize the files, both for purposes of easier search and for preserving the historical record. 

&gt;**More than 70 years after the end of World War II, the ITS receives more than 1,000 inquiries every month from all around the world.** Most of them now come from younger generations who are seeking information about the fate of their family members. In 2015, the ITS received around 15,500 requests regarding the fate of 21,909 persons from survivors, family members or researchers.

&gt;During the compensation phase of Eastern European forced labourers through the ""Remembrance, Responsibility and Future"" Foundation between 2000 and 2007, around 950,000 enquiries were sent to the Tracing Service. As a result of this flood of enquiries, the ITS was tremendously over-extended. Consequently, this created a gigantic backlog, which temporarily did considerable damage to the standing of the institution. Especially enquiries, which had no direct bearing on the foundation, remained unprocessed. 

Since 2007 the documents there have been made accessible [to researchers from 11 specific countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Tracing_Service#Copies_made_available), it will still be another 20 years until the information from this archive can become public.

If, for whatever reason, anyone in the world needs a death certificate or a new name is added due to new/previously unsighted documents: That's what the *Sonderstandesamt Bad Arolsen* deals with.

____

And that's what brings this all together: **Why was this funded three decades in advance?**

Because by the time those three decades run out the archives will have been publicly accessible for *ten years* and if someone, anyone, who then goes through them finds a name that was not officially recorded as a victim of German camps (or if they need a death certificate for whatever reason), it's the responsibility of the special registry office in Bad Arolsen to deal with this and hand out the respective official death certificates.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/9nu6yy/150000_on_the_streets_in_germany_today_for_human/e7qayqy/,rEvolutionTU,1539488565

However, it is what it is, and we obviously cannot expect everybody to make nice. Just look at how politics in Bosnia work, and it becomes apparent how much nationalism sells. 

And that's the worst part really. I'm not a nationalist, I don't give two fucks about the ethnicity of anybody I come into contact with. Hell, my wife is Croatian, and we've met during the war. But that's all on the individual level.

As groups, we all very nationalistic, and there is very little trust to go around. If shit hits the fan again, I'd bet my ass that there would be a substantial number of people that would like to slit my throat because I'm a Serb, and that goes for everybody. 

It's okay not to care about that stuff, if most of the people around you care, you cannot put your head in the ground and pretend that it's all the same. That's the logic that got me into that war in the first place. I didn't want it, but I'd rather have my tribe win than the tribe that's shooting at me.",Rep.

In Poland nationalism is way more defensive and protective in nature than what West usually thinks of. Because of Polish history Polish nationalism is not about subduing others but about preserving Polish identity and protecting Polish borders and customs.

Inside the nationalist movements there are falangists (socialism with Christian values), democrats (national democrats were a big movement in pre WW2 Poland and still are today), libertarians (yes, national libertarians) and of course conservatives, the ruling party could be thrown in here as well as their economic views are kinda conservative national social democrats.

Outside of fringe, marginal movements there are no ""fascists"" or ""Nazis"" in the Polish nationalist movement. They are even less common and less organized then far-left like the Communist Party of Poland, etc.

I know that from the perspective of the West making a distinction between ""nationalism"" and ""being evil"" or ""far-right"" is hard. Think of ""nationalism"" as ""not globalism"".

2788,"&gt; It was never populated when it was still an island, I think.

Schokland was absolutely populated when it was an island. It used to be much bigger. In the 13th century it was used by pirates as a base to operate from and had its own mint on the island. From the 15th century there were also two small villages on the island. The church that's still on the island dates from 1834, and replaced a church from 1717.

In the 19th century the island was flooded which made it much smaller, and a few decades later a royal decree ordered the island cleared; it was the poorest municipiality in the country, the local economy was basically non-existent, and maintaining the island was deemed too expensive. At that time there were more than 600 people living there. Since the evacuation, only a few civil servants lived permanently on the island.

2806,"&gt; But most of all, I’m amazed of how the police in Poland, a country which looks more civilised than Romania, allowed the intersection of an LGBT march with a neo-fascist march, and didn’t intervene.

It's a competence of local administration to issue permission for a march. The president (he's anti-PiS, a member of an opposition party PO, BTW) did not issue a permit for the LGBT march. This decision was later overturned by a court.

The both marches were then coordinated not to intersect. However, the nationalists did not disperse after the march.

It was actually the police who bore the brunt. They separated the LGBT/anti-nationalists from the nationalists and were attacked by the latter.

2829,"That's not the argument whatsoever. Regardless of how one views the dubious merits of Greece's economic policy or Poland's decision to refuse migrant quotas, you are not portraying the argument accurately whatsoever.

The argument is the complete hypocrisy in how Germany portrays it's role in the EU.

People take issue with the highly moral tone of German diplomacy vis-a-vis other countries, which is completely at odds with how Germany *actually* conducts itself.

The argument goes that whenever some pan-European crisis emerges (such as the sovereign debt crisis and the migrant crisis), Germany takes part in unilateral conditions to be imposed on the EU, or offending party. In the sovereign debt crisis this involved severe fiscally contractionary policies on southern European member states. In the migrant crisis, this involved Germany working through/and with the institutions to circumvent established treaties regarding asylum seekers and then impose quotas on other EU countries, some of whom accepted, and some who didn't. 

In both cases, Greece and Poland/Hungary/Czech Republic were subject to strong diplomatic condemnations by the German government for having 'betrayed' the community spirit, for not making sacrifices for the betterment of a wider Europe.

The issue is that when some issue comes up for Germany for which they *should* forgo the easy option (i.e. NS2) they don't and claim its a national interest, while simultaneously accusing other governments of pursuing the very same thing.

On the other side, he has effectively killed off US participation in the two biggest trade deals that were on the Horizon - TPP and TTIP. Trump is by no means a free trader - like the GOP traditionally is. 

&gt; Fighting China seems to be the #1 priority

You are aware that him imposing steel tariffs effectively destroyed a united western front against China, which would have been much more effective? 

&gt; Trump is at least fighting for manufacturing to return back to the states

I have not seen any success of this strategy so far. [I see no significant spike here](https://i.imgur.com/dmB9TlR.png). 

&gt; Obama just gave up and even stated ""Those jobs are never coming back"". 

Obama is right. Every serious economist will confirm that for you. Manufacturing for cheap products will not return to the US because workers are paid too much for that, assembly lines for iPhones are unlikely to go anywhere near the western world as well. Obama tried the Trump route with tariffs by the way as well - on tyres - and failed miserably. Tariffs don't work as a tool for ""bringing back manufacturing"". The world is too interconnected for that. ",Lower Saxony (Germany),/r/europe/comments/9nu6yy/150000_on_the_streets_in_germany_today_for_human/e7pmrdc/,MarktpLatz,1539463763

Trying to sell TPP and TTIP as anything but a bad deal at the time is disengenous. The IP protections and job protections for things like nursing would have been tragic. It wasn't until we left that they became slightly better. 

&gt;You are aware that him imposing steel tariffs effectively destroyed a united western front against China, which would have been much more effective?

China is overproducing steel on a such a massive scale and dumping it all over the west, they have crushed any domestic production worldwide. There was no western front against China because the entire west has been complicit.

I addressed it by saying France army doesn't just defend. The budget is not for defense only, projection power is a large part of it, which denies the point ""wow they have such a big budget but it's useless because no one would invade but themselves"".

Showing your ignorance once again.

The deal was made for peace. It was signed by all three parties. There would be no war if you didn't make it so.

If the rest of the world didn't decide to stick their fat fingers in it to protect their own interest there would be no war.

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_plans_proposed_before_and_during_the_Bosnian_War#Carrington%E2%80%93Cutileiro_plan

&gt;On 18 March 1992, all three sides signed the agreement; Alija Izetbegović for the Bosniaks, Radovan Karadžić for the Bosnian Serbs and Mate Boban for the Bosnian Croats.

So what do we have here ? Oh a peace plan with no war, all 3 sides signed.

And what happened

&gt;On 28 March 1992, after a meeting with US ambassador to Yugoslavia Warren Zimmermann in Sarajevo, Izetbegović withdrew his signature and declared his opposition to any division of Bosnia.

German puppet masters (USA), ruined it. 

War happened because you forced everyone to live in what they didn't want to. Nobody wanted to live together with Muslims, and Serbs and Croats didn't want to live with each other either.

It's sort of suspected the Hungarian brewery did this on purpose and in anticipation of the shitshow that went down, to boost their profile in Hungary, where they were almost unknown previously. 

And naturally in reaction the government started pressuring Heineken Hungary, even though they told them Heineken Romania is a completely different entity. 

They then passed a law prohibiting commercial uses of symbols of oppression, like the red star on their logo. It died down afterwards when Heinkenen Romania announced they've come to an agreement with the other brewery and later the courts judged the law cannot be applied for the beer bottles, because it's obviously not an attempt at glorifying Communism.

3017,"Are you seriously going to compare conquest of land in the early middle ages with modern day illegal immigration? I've seen this meme circle many times and it makes no sense if you have basic historical knowledge. 

First of all, in the middle ages (especially in the IX century) there were no strict borders, there were some general lines that signaled the end of a country and the beginning of another one but they weren't enforced.  Additionally, borders constantly  changed in medieval times because of wars, border regions very often changed hands between kings and lords. Lastly, the Pannonian basin was very sparsely populated in the early middle ages, meaning the Hungarians didn't have to try too hard in terms of conquering, it was already there for the taking.

This is first class historical revisionism. Law and Justice (PiS) and its predecessors have been in the establishment during all this time. [Lech Kaczyński](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lech_Kaczy%C5%84ski), the late brother of the current PiS ruler, Jarosław Kaczyński,  has been:

1. Security Minister in the Presidential Chancellery  (1991)
2. President of the Supreme Audit Office (1992-1995)
3. Ministry of Justice (2000-2001)
4. Mayor of Warsaw (2002-2005)
5. President until his tragic death (2005-2010). 

Out of 21 years, he was not in some kind of office only 6 years.

I've looked into this, and have not actually found any concrete evidence that would back this up. Seeing as you claim it so often, do you actually have any proof that would back up your statement? (For the record, I already know you probably don't, but spreading hate doesn't really rely on any concrete facts). 

There is no historical record of Orthodoxy within the lands of the Bosnian Crown (central BiH) before the Ottoman invasion, a distinct Bosnian identity was clearly developed for a long period before the Ottomans stepped foot in BiH. Bosniaks mainly descend from people who lived in BiH who were feudal subjects of the Bosnian king.

Tvrtko I Kotromanic in his 1378 charter to Dubrovnik makes a clear distinction between Serbdom and Bosniandom in terms of identity, it's rather clear that they were separate entities and separate identities already in that period. If they were 'Serbs', as you constantly write, then why would any distinction be made?

&gt;Clothes are pretty decently priced here, with a wide range of prices, I’d say it’s on par with Western Europe considering the prices and the demand.

Prices are not the issue, the issue is that the brands you buy and price sensitivity of the market is still different then in Italy. Right now there is siginificantly more people being able to pay 50 EUR for a T-shirt then in Poland. The local H&amp;M like reserved are decently priced, but consuption of imported brands give you more leverage in trade than consumption of your own stuff. Nobody cares what is your potential for buying your stuff, they are into doing bussiness with you so you can buy theirs.

&gt;When you’re trying to compare economies’ international market strength, yes. When you’re comparing anything inside the country with regards to the citizens and with regards to anything that you’d use Polish zlotys for, and when you’re comparing the living standards, PPP is where it’s at.

Oh, I am sorry, I did not know you were talking about Polish international influence inside Polands. In that case I agree, Poland is trully more influential in Poland.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Netherlands don’t really have any soft power and any leverage in the EU. The focus isn’t on them, and their population is small. Population matters greatly. That’s why poor Russia has so much more influence than Italy despite having the same nominal GDP.

&amp;#x200B;

Their nominal GDP is huge and their are integral part of the whole economical ecosystem having the largest port. They are much more well regarded and are huge net contributor considering their population.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And you’re completely forgetting that other countries have richer and poorer regions too. The capital region of Mazovia, which includes Warsaw, has a GDP per capita PPP of Finland, which makes it the richest region in Poland. Not sure how that compares to northern Italy, but I’m just saying - we have our richer and poorer regions too. What matters is the country’s average, not the richest region’s average.

&amp;#x200B;

If you need to use PPP to prove how rich a region is, then that region probably is not that rich at all. PPP Bratislava belongs to the richest regions in Europe, do you see me claiming we are some kind of next switzerland? No, because I am not delusional.The fact is that their richer regions with population of Poland are still way ahead of Poland and will be for at least next decade or two, because internationally people care about real money, real wages, real gdp, meaning nominal.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And by the way. Poland is considered the avatar of CEE, because its population is by far the biggest one in the region. That’s how it always is in situations like these. It’s also the most successful country of the region considering the amount of progress they’ve made despite the big population. Essentially the most progress comparing the 1990 state to the current state. Because of the big population, it also has a big economy, certainly the dominant one in CEE and the Visegrad Four. Warsaw is the economic, business and financial hub of CEE, almost all the major companies with their respective sectors targeted at CEE station their CEE headquarters in Poland, most often Warsaw, and that’s where we get the skyscrapers from. It’s just a fact. If there has to be an avatar for the region, it’s Poland. Don’t know what other country could that be.

&amp;#x200B;

Those are all reasons why Poland is avatar of Poland, the population is reason why warsaw has those skryscrapers, becuse in V4 it is the biggest city, but can you actually name one instance where all V4 countries wanted to name Poland as some kind of representation of the region? Czechs do not feel represented by Polish in EU, Slovaks certainly do not and Hungarians, I really do not think so.No V4 country wants V4 to become some sort of Benelux and none of them want to have Poland representing them, because they simply do not have a reason.Even in such a populist topic as refugees Poland stands there with Hungary throwing hissy fits, while the other half of V4 is trying to cooperate, going as far as Svk already promising to accomodate some of the refugees if need be.

Drawbacks: it's very expensive by local standards, their cable TV service is awful, and those fibre-optics lines are installed only in newer buildings in big cities (our commieblock did get fibre-optics during renovations, though).

Being white has nothing to do with it. There are many black millionaires and billionaires who probably are dirty but you will never hear about it - because they are rich and have the resources to cover it up. Now, you might say that coloured people are misrepresented among rich people. But whose fault is that? Nobody gave out free money to the rich - they had to earn it themselves. I might agree that historically coloured people didn't have an easy life, but right now they (we) are all equal in law and they can use that to create and conduct their businesses under the same rules that apply to everybody else.

Now, war on drugs. You might say that police has a tendency to target primarily black and brown populations. But it's not police's fault that black and brown people are (sadly) overrepresented among drug dealers and other criminals. For historical (not racial!) reasons there are more black people among the criminals. That's a fact. There's even an entire Wikipedia article on that: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_crime_in_the_United_States. Now you might say that the law is applied unfairly because it ignores the history of ghettoization and stuff. So what should the courts and police do - treat black people lightly just because they are black and/or come from the ghetto?

The progressiveness of Europe is a completely different phenomenon, although it's true that there was more interaction and influence than people generally give credit for (Avicenna, Averroes and Alfarabius to name a few and the interaction with West that had left a print on middle-east), it started in enlightenment era after long religious unrest and conflict.

3306,"&gt;Your post. Literally the driver of the whole discussion. It's a link to a single paragraph that complains about the lessening of recreational useage of weapons.

I was quoting ONE of the reasons in opposition to this law you buffoon. There are multiple reasons as well and I have already explained them in this thread.

&gt;Gun deaths are unrelated to alcohol deaths. Complaining about one not being squashed doesn't make your position stronger it just makes you look like a whiny little brat.

There is no gun problem in Europe. None. These laws were passed in response to Islamists using illegally smuggled AKs. It is a blatant infringement with very poor reasoning.

&gt;You're not losing rights, you're very understandably put under more supervision while wielding a deadly weapon that is irrelevant to modern survival. Hunting is not required to survive. Traps and poisons are more effective and passive methods of pest control that are objectively better than the active shooting of pests. This is bolstered heavily by the abundance, small size, and nocturnal habits of most pests(especially in Europe)

Yes they are. The most common weapon and most commonly owned magazines in Switzerland are effectively banned without time and investment into a shooting organization and applying for a special exemption permit which many cantons do not issue. This is a loss of a rights.

You don't need many things to survive in modern society. Nobody needs anything other than a shelter, food, and water to live. Does that make those freedoms which are unnecessary to surving completely meaningless? No. Get that through your damn head.

You are not a hunter. There is ample proof of hunting being a huge reason to maintaining sustainable population of wildlife and control of pests without overpopulation, as well as conservation to nature.

Rock solid Unionism can rely on roughly 35% and absolute Indy on 45% at current polling.

The Norman invasion of Britain included three groups; Normans from Normandy and relatives and allies Normano-Flemmish and Normano-Bretons from Brittany. Breton is a celtic language spoken in Brittany in North West France and it is closely related to and descendant from Welsh and Cornish spoken in the South West of Great Britain.

When the Normans took charge of Great Britain the Cornish and Welsh speaking areas were given to Breton families from amount the Norman court. They married into the local royalty, many of whom were already their relatives. So the Celtic speaking parts of the Norman invaders got the Celtic Speaking parts of Britain, up the Western Coast.

The invasion of Ireland was mounted as a private enterprise by Welsh-Norman families to aid their relatives in Ireland. The families in Ireland were on the East coast and had a lot of marriages across to Wales and allies via Viking/Danish family and cultural ties too. Gaelic leaders had recently become dominant across Ireland and the demoted families sought help from Wales.

The invasion of Ireland was the ""Cambro-Norman"" invasion, by families who were really a mix of Irish, Welsh, Breton, Norman, and Scandinavian descent and the local Irish called them ""Saxons"" which confuses things. While they spoke French  and brought French laws and things to Ireland and radically changed Ireland forever they married their Gaelic speaking Irish relatives and kind of disappeared into a combined ""Gaelic-Norman"" aristocracy and the old phrase goes ""the Normans became more Irish than the Irish themselves"" became a thing later when their descendants fourth against subsequent British invasions of Ireland.

&gt;Did you read this? http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-4465_en.htm

I did and I already explained how this will significantly impact gun rights in Switzerland. The most commonly owned weapon (SG 500) and magazines will be banned. You will need to be an active member of a shooting organizations AND apply for a special exemption permit from the cantonal police. Many cantons do not issue these permits, and the others that do carry significant restrictions (yearly inspections and needing to apply for a day pass every time you wish to shoot these weapons). 

&gt;Furthermore it imposes the regulations that hampered Breivik's ability to easily obtain a pistol to remaining weapons not covered by that regulation.

Again with Breivik. This was an isolated case which happens in a blue moon. It would not impact Paris and other such attacks that are used as the justification for this directive because these were illegally smuggled AKs from outside the EU. I do not care about one isolated case, and basing policy off of that is absurd.

&gt;Note: it does not stop you from owning guns. it does not stop you from hunting. it does not stop you from shooting at a range.

It greatly limits the type of guns and magazines you are allowed to own. These weapons are a non-issue. It is a huge infringement on gun rights in Switzerland. Gun owners in Switzerland agreed multiple times in the past on stricter restrictions, but they keep getting stricter without end. The line needs to be drawn somewhere.

Most gay people wouldn't buy a cake from a shop that had a sign on the front where it said *""we don't serve gay people""* but the problem is that none of these stores does this because it decreases business from straight people who don't want to give their money to buisness' that discriminate against gay people.

We have just a few options on how to deal with the pension crisis:

1) mandatory reproduction (yikes)
2) mass immigration (double yikes)
3) slashing the pension system entirely and make every body fully responsible for his own retirement 

I think 3 is by far the best. But it’s not gonna work if the money they save for retirement is going to be worth less than half than when they started saving.

And I never said „no inflation“. Just less than how it is now. Like from 2 to 1%. 

The thing is: if we do nothing, why should young people stay in a country where they have to pay for a system they themselves will never benefit from while at the same it’s impossible for them to save? They than emigrate and then there’s less people here to pay in the system. And this is not fiction. Brain drain is a growing problem in my home country Germany. And the worst thing? It isn‘t normal people that emigrate, but highly skilled professionals. They move to the USA or Australia, where they earn substantially more. Australia even has the most sustainable pension system in the world according to a report.

That's enough for me to be concerned. Plus even without Russia we have China, the US, India, even some African countries which I can see as being more important as any one European country.

&gt;we have some very clear differences and competition with other EU members, especially France

Why? Because they operate in Africa?

I'm Italian, I am pissed at their messing with Libya as much as the next guy, but France at the end of the day is next door and they have a vested interest in the safety and well being of the continent

China isn't nextdoor, the US isn't. We are all too small to oppose or control the effects of US and Chinese foreign policy alone, the EU manages to do so in trade, we should do the same in this.

Sure right now the Americans might sound more appealing than the French. But in a century who knows? A solution doesn't have to be perfect, just to be better than the alternatives. 

And pretty much anything is better than assuming other countries tens of thousands kilometers away will, in one century, care about 28 miniscule countries just because we're Europe so we must be important

3625,"Not sure I agree entirely.  
The middle of England became industrialised during the industrial revolution mainly because that was where coal was found.  It was just easier to have your industrial production close by the source of your fuel.  The same goes for Wallonia in Belgium (The other poor region in Northern Europe), which through people like Cockerill developed just the same way.  
  
The market for these places wasn’t just the UK or Belgium but the whole world.   The UK industrial output took cheap raw materials from it’s colonies and exported the end products back to them.  That is why a city like Liverpool developed as it did.  It was the main harbour from that coal basin to the rest of the world.  
  
The industrial decline of these areas has been going one for much longer than the EU single market existing.  After the second world war a combination of loosing the colonies - and thus a guaranteed export market and the creation of direct competitors in one fell swoop - together with changes in energy production set in a decline which accelerated rapidly in the late sixties and early seventies way before single market.
  
These regions just never recovered since the basic reason of their whole expansion had been monolithic:  They just were a big factory.  
Trading their products happened in the old trading centers that existed prior to the industrialisation.  These have a more adaptable economy since they can switch to new stuff to sell from other places.  Thus London and it’s neighbouring areas were able to stay rich.  
It’s the same in Belgium, where Antwerp is still the important economic pole radiating out to Flanders but Wallonia is in a terminal decline.

The single market didn’t help them of course but the decline of British industry had been going on for much longer and would have happened even without the EU.

3700,"While I personally am on the Swiss side when it comes to the actual gun policy — right to bear arms and all that — I'm a little fuzzy as to what sort of change Switzerland is aiming for at the EU level.

Is the idea to get Switzerland a custom-negotiated arrangement with the EU that applies only to Switzerland?  Sort of a ""look, you know that I'm not a problem, and you can live with the ruleset simply being different here?""  Maybe some sort of compromise?

Or is it to roll back the directive for the EU as a whole?

Or is it from people who are willing to draw a red line on the Schengen Area over the gun rights in question and would favor leaving the Schengen Area over giving up Swiss gun policy?

Because I would think that for many people, their willingness to sign would depend on which of the above three options the signer expects Switzerland to seek to obtain.

Their only allies were South Africa, Portugal and Israel and even then business/assistance was done on a deniable basis they did pretty well out of it until Kissinger got South Africa to cut them off. 

South Africa was also under varying degrees of sanction. It was under total arms embargo while fighting a war (the Soviets fielded VASTLY superior weapons against them) and its only reliable allies and trade partners were Israel and a few Asian countries like Taiwan and South Korea and Japan. 

I think Britain can call on many more reliable allies for help, there are plenty of countries who stand to gain at the expense of the EU and we're not at war yet either. Long term if we forge good trade deals and good relationships with actual allies and diversify our economy then i can see us doing somewhat better than we do now and being in a much better position when the EU ultimately collapses.

3819,"Why not? Many people do the same thing in real life with mortages. Those are often significantly above what they make in a year. And government is far more suited to deal with debt them a household.

Now such a high gdp/dept ratio isn't ideal, since it does seem to inhibited growth a bit at those levels but again, there are plenty of countries who manage it even if it isn't a great for them. But the mention wasn't meant to show case best practices, but to mention what actually counts.

It also shows that the idea that anything above 15% is problematic and dangerous is simple misguided. There is a huge field between 15% and 100%.

And there is also the fact that your math simply misses the mark. Suppose you do have a 100% debt v GDP.

Say your interest is 1% and economic growth is 2.02% after a year your debt as a percentage of your gdp has suddenly dropped 1% to 99% even though total amount has gone up 1%.

And for a long while your debt will go down by about 1% every year. A country who simply keeps a balanced budget will have the debt go down to manageable levels in time without paying one cent as long as growth is higher then interest.

Now this will not always be the case, but again for many it is the case right now. And suppose you do spend 5% a year in those same circumstances. You would have paid off your debt in 18 years instead of a hundred.

So all of this changes if your interest is higher then your growth. Then suddenly the reverse is true, and you are in real problems.

The whole role 50/50 thing:
I actually think we agree a lot here. 50/50 is stupid and Jordan Peterson makes a way better case for it than I ever could(Source I will edit in when I have wifi)
It was important to break the old role system but now we have to find a working middle ground for the reasons you mentioned and plenty others.

Birthrate: It is low and it is a problem we have yet to find good long term answers for. In the short term we can manage it through immigration. The long term solution will at least in parts consist of the middle ground we will find between total freedom of role and the old role system.
I strongly believe that this is fixable for various (complicated) reasons. 

European superstate: of course you first have to build up a european identity before a superstate is possible. That something like this is possible to create was proven by history(USA, Germany etc.). This is something that is currently happening but will take time. If a true European state (by will of the people not dictated) is to exist it will of course be superior in international politics and people will want to die for it.

Values: There are other ways to find meaningful values then religion. I think the main problem is that many people have value systems which are concerned with problems they don't experience in their own lifes but they read/hear about (on the internet) and can't change. Same goes for self worth, many look to the internet/social media for self worth which rarely works. That's something that can be fixed I believe by making people aware of it and motivating people to support, recognize and respect people in real life not only online. There are probably more parts to the solution but it is a start, also it is important that we as a society respect ""simple"" jobs like plumber more but at least in Germany there are campaigns in this direction and the salaries in these jobs is getting higher.

Crime Rate: it is true crime increased in 2015 but it is also steadily falling since then. Comparing countries here is hard since crimes are counted very differently (some count number of offenders, some count reported crimes, some count only major crimes, some only count crimes where someone has been found guilty).
The bigger thing is that crime rate compared to 30 years ago is still very low and there are less major crimes than back then but more pickpockets etc..
Also if you look at crime by age group immigrants are not much worse then the citizens they are just mostly in the most criminal age group. The highest crime rate is among denied asylum seekers and that's a real failure of government because that desperate men turn to crime is no surprise.

With interests rates as low as they are, it might have been better for the Dutch society overall to build down the debt a little slower, and invest part of the money earmarked for paying down the debt.

Debt reduction is certainly important. But so is healthcare and tertiary schooling which are both subjects that have been restructured fto significantly shifts costs from the government onto the citizens.

3917,"First off, I appreciate the reply, even if I don't agree with any of it .


&gt; The values are about self-fulfillment but not only your own,they are about setting the people around you up for their self-fulfillment or at the very least not stopping them from doing so.



Right now the Western European outlook is :  




Education (often general) &gt; Trade school





European Superstate (that no one will die for) &gt; Individual countries (that people will die for)




Feminism/Liberalism (as in ""a woman can be a man but she also has the option to be a woman if she works twice as hard which sucks so women just prefer to be men and not have children) &gt; Traditional / Religious family roles .






All Religions are bad / but also all religions are equal and saying otherwise (often towards Islam) is Islamophobic  &gt; Faith based communities or ""The only thing worse then religion is a world without religion"" .



&gt; especially in regards to depression, feeling like you don´t belong somewhere etc. but there is a whole generation growing up with these troubles and this generation has a very vivid discussion and willingness to fix the social structure so the next generations don´t have as much trouble with depression and its effects and causes.



It's very difficult to ""fix it"" if you don't have any meaningful values or understanding of what you are . Values (as well as an appropriate job) offer self worth , which in turn offers self assurance .





Keep telling the women that they can be ""anything they want to be"" . Keep emphasizing that over ""you are a link in a chain, between your grand parents and the future"" . Or keep telling them that it's normal not to have kids. Or keep telling them that having day-care and ripping their semi-infants from them and placing them in the care of strangers (who don't really get payed all that much) is the best thing for them and the child .





And just as the ""West"" keeps messing with female instincts , it keeps messing with male instincts as well .  Let's automate everything and keep men from having jobs &amp; feeling useful . Let's demilitarize and open the borders .... surely the male instinct to protect will just vanish ... , or it it will need to be ""re-educated"" . Hey I know , how about one more course in ""diversity training"" ?




In short your best bet to create a dystopia is to try to create a utopia . And the West (especially the EU) is hard at work at creating a utopia .



If as you say : "" this generation has a very vivid discussion and willingness to fix the social structure so the next generations don´t have as much trouble with depression and its effects and causes "" -- perhaps this generation might want to take a look at what makes men men and what makes women women . Not the wishful thinking , not the ""we have to have 50/50 equality in STEM studies or OMG something is wrong"" , but the base material that the current people in power try to social engineer (very badly) .



I have no problem with women actually choosing careers . But it should be a choice made in a well informed early adulthood -- and part of that information should be from other women who tell them that the Feminist ""you can do/be everything"" is a lie for the majority of women . And the built up guilt from always compromising (as a female working parent) will lead to unhappiness &amp; stress (same as ""doing everything by the book"" going to university, finding a job and discovering at 30+ that ""all the good men have been taken"") .

&gt; Funny thing you mention the low birth rates and immigrants in one answer,they are kinda the emergency solution right now and I am sick and tired of hearing that it isn't working.



Crime rate is up , rape rate is up -- Sweden &amp; England now lead that chart and it's not because the Swedish &amp; British men have suddenly decided to break bad , but because Sweden took in the largest migrant quota relative to it's population size and England is no longer England -- if London is the example, where less then half the population is British .



And as for low birth rates that is a fact , weather you are sick of hearing about it or not .



This is a more clear chart then the one you provided :



https://i.redd.it/99fq4wuvxth11.png




But even if we use the chart you provided , look up the countries and territories above and below Germany , and look at the vast difference .

It is not about the Nazis being inspired to commit a genocide but them knowing that committing a genocide can be successful and lawful in the European context. It's about the lack of consequences. The quote embodies the lack of action taken in response to the Armenian Genocide. The Holocaust was committed lawfully. Again, colonialism was off the grid in this context. So were the Muslims. When Christians could get wiped out in Europe's borders by Muslims without consequences, then what chance could Jews have in an era where anti-Semitism was ok? Again, the quote is an understatement.

As the average age of the population increases, two things will become a problem :

1) old people don't invest new money, they either live from a small pension or withdraw from their savings. 

2) there are fewer young people joining the investment pool at the bottom than there are old people leaving the investment pool at the top.

[Not necessarily true.](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/002795011222200109)

&gt;The main conclusion is that, while in ‘normal times’, fiscal consolidation would lead to a fall in debt to GDP ratios, in current circumstances this is likely to be ‘self-defeating’ for the EU collectively. ***That is, with the fiscal consolidation plans currently in place, debt ratios will be higher in 2013 in the EU as a whole rather than lower.*** This will also be true in almost all individual member states (including the UK, but with the exception of Ireland). The implication is that the current strategy being pursued by individual Member States, as well as the EU as a whole, is fundamentally flawed. Even on its own terms, it is making matters worse.

Ergo, net debt would be lower with no austerity at all.

4075,"Yes. But at the same time we also know that the worse thing is money not circulating anymore. Fiscal conservativeness is fine but can be a problem if it becomes hard to invest because there is no one want to lend you money. From a macro economy standpoint the real problems are:

-No money circulating = gridlocked economy = less tax revenue = even less possible to payback.

The crisis in the US, Spain and Ireland showed us that the real problem is high private (household) debt in time of financial crisis. A heavily emdebted  State able to kick start the economy is less problematic in time of crisis (the US, Japan, Germany, Sweden in the 90's) than a low emdebted State having to rush because his financial system is collapsing over his already emdebted population (Ireland, Iceland, Spain,...)

4130,"&gt; What that means is that we will never go bankrupt, no matter how weak Sterling becomes against other currencies. It just means we import less.

Debt has to be rolled over constantly, as old bonds need to be replaced when they mature. Buyers would consider the expected loss of purchasing power when they bid for newly issued bonds, i.e., the UK would have to pay a higher interest on its debt. This additional cost would have to be covered by taxes (or more debt at even higher cost), which are also in sterling. People could buy less with fewer after-tax pounds.  

There are some things you must import, because they simply don't exist domestically (e.g., raw materials). There are also things you *want* to import, because you don't have a local industry for it. And while you *could* rebuild e.g., a clothing industry, to make garments out of wool (does the UK have manufacturers of the necessary machines?), the necessary labour would probably better be employed further up the value chain.

So, imports would become more expensive, which would directly affect the standard of living. It's not simply a matter of choosing ""British cars"" -- less than half of their components (in value) are sourced domestically, and roughly half of *those* components' value has itself been imported. Even if we're generous, two thirds of a UK-built car's cost is tied to imports. And cars are something the UK actually still has a domestic industry for.  

The UK imports about half the food it consumes. It also exports food, albeit less than it imports, so some belt-tightening would be needed. Then there are the imports related to the food the UK does produce itself -- despite local production, the UK is a net importer of oil, and domestic refineries only produce half the diesel those tractors (British tractors with British spare parts, hopefully) require to plow those turnip fields. And again, turnips instead of poultry is a loss of living standard.

The point is, while the UK could print the sterling to pay its debt, things are a bit more complicated in reality. ",European Federation | Germany,/r/europe/comments/9nlgfg/europe_debt_as_a_of_gdp_by_country/e7ngmp8/,CountVonTroll,1539369938

Basic keynesian economics does call for the down payment of loans during economic boom times. But we were talking about the extreme level of it, not the principle by itself.

A slower decrease of debt would likely be more beneficial to the overal state of the country.

Edit: this and my previous comment numbers were about the netherlands, not germany. I see in your edit you were talking about germany.

As an aditional data point, public spending as percentage of GDP in the netherlands is currently lower then it was before the crisis.

4146,"&gt; My grandfather shared everything he had to say about his family. That is why he kept them in line too. So did many many other people.

I've never, ever heard of that, and I had all kinds of people in my family, from loyal CPSU members to closet Ukrainian nationalists.

&gt;Whether people in the church or in your family or in the state, nobody had their own opinion. People were all defined not by their own merit but by their group identity. So any straying outside of the defined 'group' was a major sin against the party, against the group, against yourself. That is why people ratted. 

Yeah, maybe in some parts of the USSR in the 30s and 40s. Later on, it was not like that. You were usually very much safe in the confines of close family, and close friends (although with friends you could have unpleasant surprises). A father ratting out his children, or siblings? Extremely rare.

Some people felt they could extend that ""circle of trust"" that to their priest for some strange reason, and they were wrong.

And of course people had their own opinion. By the mid-70s, it was ""hip"" and ""cool"" to be skeptical of the communists, if not outright anti-communist, among Soviet students. Unless you were explicit and loud about it no one could do anything about it - safety in numbers.

I don't know what your source is for all this stuff, but mine is dozens and dozens of people who spent most/some of their adult life in the USSR. Family members, family friends, etc. What you're describing in North Korea, or Stalinist USSR, not post-WW2 USSR.

&gt; There was nothign special within the church, there was no special conspiracy where the curch woudl specifically collude with the state in order to oppress you.

No it absolutely did specifically collude with the state, not different than say ""a writers' union"" would rat out non-party-line poetry, but certainly not what people would expect from a church. The Orthodox Church in the USSR was re-founded by the KGB in the 40s and run by the KGB in a top-down fashion. It was a tool of the state.

&gt;Power structures are enforced BOTTOM to TOP. NOT top to bottom lke most people think. The state is a reflection of the people.

4186,"Don't get me wrong, I don't don't disagree with the above.

It's similar to 'Comfort Woman' arguement in Japan, near-total indifference is endemic amongst the Japanese, the Japanese aren't taught about the crimes committed by Imperial Japan.

The Japanese know that those crimes happened and in many cases acknowledge that they happened but they will not call them what they really are and will not apologise for them.

The Germans on the other hand are taught about the crimes committed under National Socialism, there is no ignorance to it (with some exceptions) and many Germans carry a sense of shame about the Holocaust that modern Germans need not carry, they themselves didn't commit those crimes.

The education of the Germans could, like the education of the Turks and Japanese be described as indoctrination, positive in the case of the former and negative in the case of the two latter.

If you've been bought up to believe one narrative then I'm sure it's difficult to break away from that, although many Turks have.

The 'Armenian state propaganda' things is not too dissimilar to the views many hold about the Jews being in control of the world's media, finance, etc.

Poor education and ideology go hand in hand but are two different things.

Look at the UK, what we are taught of the empire is all roses, there's nothing of the oppression, slavery, mass murder, cultural destruction, theft etc, try telling the British that Churchill, the war-hardened crusader against tyranny and oppression, was a mass murderer and his views of the Irish and Indians weren't much better than Hitler's of the Jews.

If you look at my comment history you'll note that I've commented widely on this post, calling out those that deny, whitewash and minimise crimes against humanity; I disagree with this guy's views, but I do understand why he had them, and his comments about why he has them and his comment about being prepared to discuss, show at least a degree of openness about willingness to learn.

With regards to your comment about anti-Semitism in Egypt, it's great that you and many others are aware of the issue, but many aren't as enlightenment, and that that's not limited to Egypt or to anti-Semitism.

Look at suicide bombings carried about by Muslims (assuming that you are a Muslim, please don't take this as an attack it's merely an example of extreme ideology), the Hadith says that suicide is a sin, anyone educated in the teachings of Islam knows this, so logic would dictate that no Muslim would take his own life especially in order to kill innocents, another sin, yet ideology can become deeply ingrained that sense matters not and it's hard to see the wood for the trees. the",,/r/europe/comments/9nh26f/map_of_the_armenian_genocide_showing_the_major/e7nha43/,[deleted],1539370491

This is probably the main reason [MP's rejected the proposal,](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23892783) no one wanted to see another regime change (almost certain to happen had this line been pursued) that only left a failed state due to a lack of coherent policy on any form of endgame.

Do you see where Greeks are?

&gt;To saying that most of modern turks are descendants of the Oghuz that came from Central Asia is like saying that most Italians are Germans.

Turkic genetic impact in Anatolia is bigger than Greek genetic impact.

&gt;The only difference is that Anatolia populations adopted the turkic language from the invaders

let's take you back to reality.

http://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2015/02/18/015396.full.pdf

&gt;Previous genetic studies have generally used Turks as representatives of ancient Anatolians. Our results show that Turks are genetically shifted towards Central Asians, a pattern consistent with a history of mixture with populations from this region

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4236450/

&gt;The weight for the migration event predicted to originate from the branch ancestral to East Asia (presumably Central Asia) into current-day Turkey was 0.217 (21.7%)

http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12607764/index.pdf

&gt;Moreover, results pointed out that language (Turkish) in Anatolia might not have been replaced by the elites, but by a large group of people. Therefore, it can be concluded that the observations do not support the elite dominance model of Renfrew (1987 ; 1991).

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179474

&gt;it should be noted that modern Turks are a hybrid population, comprising of the original Anatolian stock, Turkic people (i.e. of Central Asian ancestry), as well as other ethnicities from regions comprising the former Ottoman Empire.

also did you notice how these studies talk about native anatolians but not about greeks?

A fun tidbit to add, the Jamestown colony also included lots of Polish immigrants who were primarily glass makers, so if foreign specialists were required, they would be invited to come over. 

What I know for sure is that the Scottish did *not* have free trade with the colonies.

Germans are Germans and identify as such. There's no such kind of mutual identity within Bosnia. Bosnian Serbs are waay closer both culturally and linguistically to us than they are to you.

4466,"&gt;Slavery was clearly objected to by the Church on moral grounds

Objected like I were to object nose picking? Because none of the christian churches has prevented the institution of servitude and had their own serfs. And western christian churches (catholic and protestant) has failed to prevent the revival slavery during the colonial era.

&gt; Jacob Burckhardt was clear on this and he’s much greater authority on this subject than you 

Strawmanning and appeal to authority fallacy.

&gt; You are extremely biased against Christianity so it’s natural for you to bend history to favor your interpretation.

I'm biased against all ideologies. And I don't have to be balanced, only objective.

&gt;Christians viewed the games as totally immoral and barbaric (because they were) and they ended them on moral grounds mostly. 

Only because the games were offering to the gods. And I say so, because if one were to object games only on ethic grounds, then we would see that the wrong is contained in the fact that the people were tortured. Human suffering is the moral reason why the games were wrong.

However if the church position was to stop the games because of the human suffering, why the church hasn't behaved in the analogue way in other matters in which people were suffering?

Only reasonable explanation to that question, is that christians closed the games for the same reason they closed ancient temples and shrines — religious intolerance toward other faiths.

&gt;We kill for ideologies, no matter how peaceful they are on theory. 

There are two different approaches here. First one, is can a person based on his nature do harm even if he professes a peaceful ideology? Yes.

Second one, can people do harm in name of all ideologies, or only those which permit violence? Only in favor of those which permit violence. Can someone kill in name of christianity, islam or other organized religion? Of course, because most of them contain passages in their dogma that allow to do violence in their name.

Now, can someone kill in name of pacifism? 

It's a rhetorical question, don't answer. 

&gt; Again, learn to separate the wheat from the chaff. 

All ideologies are chaff.

&gt; but both those were very limited pursuits that did not reach into the population

You can't say that, you don't have a source. It's just your speculation, adapted to your dogma.

4475,"&gt; Of course it shouldn't. But this is also a strawman: I never mentioned police involvement was involved, quite the contrary.

Well that is my impression why we are discussing this. If this is such a massive societal issue then laws would need to be enacted right? And the laws need to have VERY VERY clear wording and definitions.


&gt; And speaking of strawmen, so is this:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     where 99% of women would view such sxua approaches as very appealing and using the legislative system to ban them or punish men for even trying them is dmb.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Also agreed. Also never mentioned, though. Please stop exaggerating.

While I can admit the police thing might be a strawman this is def not. This is something I said. Not something I allege you argue for.

&gt; See here here for how common women think violence against women is in their country. You many want to take a closer look in general: some very interesting results in there.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The scenario I described is real, and if you follow the link above and read up on the definitons of terms used for the survey, you will find that it's quite mild in comparison.

But it is not something I ma trying to defend. I do not say it is not real. I just want to be very specific as far as what is harassment and what isn't. Because we are walking very thin line.

&gt; I maintain that what has changed, is not that there is an epidemic of misbehaviour (spoiler: there isn't), it's that lots of women are no longer prepared to just ignore the minority of creepy men that have always been around but used to get away with it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Can we agree on that and part as friends?

Well I am not sure I agree. I def do not think harrasment was as big of an issue 200 years ago.

The prime driving force behind the rise of it are - the increase in mingling between men and women at workplace and daily events, oversxualization of everything.

We are still figuring how men and women should interact at the workplace. We are obviously doing a good job but it is a continious process. 

Do you know how the chinese almost solved hte issue with workplace harrasment? They made all , men and women, dress with long shirts and  bland pants. Would you find this acceptable solution in the west?

Of course women now are more willing and not accept as normal the behavior you described. And I agree that is reprehensible.

In reality I think Gates etc. is more interested in trying to rid the world of malaria etc. to be interested in getting involved in that sort of politics.

By the people maybe, but not officially by the state. I am not aware of official statements in the form of ""The deportations *killed* Armenians"".

There is not much difference between those two though. The deportations were intentional. The deportations killed Armenians. That is intentional killing.

4665,"&gt;What kind of ""unrealistic restrictions"" for example?

The idea that the ECB could not be the lender of last resort for the states using its currency, for example... unlike every other central bank in the world. The EZ was forced to change that misguided policy during the crisis... and promptly, the sovereign bond rates all over Europe stopped rising and started declining again.

&gt;It would be new to me that Germany can influence monetary policy. If we could, we and others Northern European countries probably would've raised the interest rate quite some time ago.

Yes, and other countries would have preferred lowering it, which means it's exactly where it needs to be to serve the needs of most Europeans. Stop playing the victim just because you can't dictate an interest rate that suits you perfectly to the rest of Europe. Besides, every Bundesland has a different ideal interest too - but Germany still had and has a federal central bank with policy too.

&gt;Greece is certainly in a way better position now than it was a few years ago. So I really doubt that the admittedly harsh reforms have hurt Greece in the long run.

Well of course, a few years ago it was suffering the worst of the cuts and now they're recovering. Austerity is eerily similar to bloodletting, and so are the arguments in favor of it - a lot of confirmation bias.

&gt;On the contrary. It probably wasn't the smartest idea from an economic point of view (a temporary Grexit would have been preferable), but not the worst either. Especially considering political implications.

A temporary Grexit would have been an open invitation to speculators to try it again with other countries, so that would have been an even worse idea.

What should have happened was an immediate action as lender of last resort by the ECB. This would have prevented a lot of the interest snowball, so the gap would have been a lot smaller to being with. Then there would still be opportunity to set right what was wrong, but the austerity that was implemented now didn't cut the fat, it cut into the flesh. Greece is less able to repay the debt due to the excessive austerity measures: the IMF admitted that much. The social security expenses that were cut generated more economic activity then they costed money.

He also went against the wishes of the actual canonical autonomous Orthodox Church of Ukraine - Metropolis of Kiev and sided with the schismatic Patriarchate of Kiev.

Furthermore, i agree with the somewhat crude statements above. The flag of HB, though similar to the croatian one, represents something else completely.

4881,"Thing is, current system does allow people to retire early. Don't party much, focus on working hard and live a modest life.. Very few people do that though.

IMO state-paid pensions are already thing of a past. Coming from eastern Europe, people never expected to live off pension. Up to 20th century, you'd work till death and hope your kids take care of you. Some people started getting pensions after WW1, but it was mostly related to employers and state pensions were for state employees mostly. Even during USSR, state-paid pension was shit and people relied on working little land they had, providing services to other people under the table or on their kids. And now people still do that :) Travelling on pension etc is still a thing you see in movies about ze Germans :)

Of course, it's bigger shock for western europe where people got used to lavish pensions in the last few generations.

Regarding inflation, holding onto savings have side effects too. Economy would slow down significantly. On the other hand, that may reduce inflation :) IMO we should focus on why inflation happens.

I didn't do enough research, but I've a feeling that quite a bit of inflation is because of overreaching regulations. For example, housing. The prices for renovation or new buildings are ever growing because of ever tightening regulations on energy class, workplace safety etc. And expensive housing sure contributes towards inflation. Same happens with cars and household machinery.

Another reason is urbanisation. More and more people try to fit into less and less space. Thus popular housing prices are skyrocketing.",Lietuva,/r/europe/comments/9mh71g/life_expectancy_versus_retirement_age_for_men_in/e7md6n2/,mantasm_lt,1539321465

Moreover, how are we going to achieve both the within close reach and the more ambitious technological goals with no R&amp;D and funding? Pour some billions and we achieve the former; pour some hundreds of billions or trillions and we may achieve the latter.

&gt;In my opinion nuclear power just distracts us from investing into renewables.

""Renewable energy sources"" include waste and biomass incineration (the latter of which is as [stupid](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/09/180912081253.htm) as the anti-nuclear power stance), so we must depart from that label. The obvious problem with solar and wind power is that they are intermittent and therefore require energy storage solutions, which are currently [incapable](https://i.imgur.com/guQaUnE.png) ([source, PDF](https://res.mdpi.com/energies/energies-08-00172/article_deploy/energies-08-00172.pdf?filename=&amp;attachment=1)) of meeting the [demand](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DnCxbuOW4AECpxC.jpg). That is to say, while the demand is in the order of tens or hundreds or thousands of GW, depending on the country, current energy storage technology not constrained by landforms can store and release energy at a rate in the order of MW.

Even if we were successful in the next decades at deriving a considerable part of electricity generation from wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, tidal power, the 100% target would surely be infeasible and possibly even theoretically impossible, therefore nuclear power will be necessary in any scenario. Bear in mind that electricity consumption will have to grow if we wish to bring transport, industry, etc. into green territory and also as a result of the implementation of energy storage, which introduces higher losses.

However, the trouble is that we absolutely cannot afford a single gram of greenhouse gas emission, and for this reason it is utterly foolish not to use a technology that is available *today*.  In light of this, the actual lethal distraction is the overemphasis on the aforementioned alternative energy sources as well as the incredibly stupid avoidance of nuclear power.",,/r/europe/comments/9ne7rg/merkels_conservatives_social_democrats_slump_as/e7m5ft8/,In_der_Tat,1539312242

The fact is that France generates the majority of their power from a source that does not produce greenhouse gasses. Are their processes involved with running a nuclear power grid that do create greenhouse gasses? Sure. Same goes for just about any system. Once set up a nuclear plant generates far more power than solar or wind can hope to do and for a long time. One reactor puts out as much power as 45 square miles of solar panels. It's a long-term investment, but that has been worth it for France. Germany has been trying to achieve similar results with solar and wind and it has yet to work out.

4912,"&gt; I don't know, how did Belgium make it as a country? I know they're mocked for their spare parliaments and inefficiency, but even so, the country is generally quite rich and successful.

Well it begins with how the country Belgium, as we know it today, was formed.
Here's a paragraph from a Wikipedia article that sums up nicely what happened and why they eventually seceded from what was then the United Kingdom of the Netherlands:

&gt;Differences between Southern and Northern Netherlands were never totally effaced. The two were divided by the issue of religion because the south was strongly Roman Catholic and the north largely Dutch Reformed. The Catholic Church in Belgium resented the state's encroachment on its traditional privileges, especially in education. In French-speaking parts of the south, attempts to enforce the use of Dutch language were particularly resented among the elite. Many Belgians believed that the United Netherlands' constitution discriminated against them. Though they represented 62 percent of the population, they were only allocated 50 percent of the seats in the House and less in the Senate while the state extracted money from the richer south to subsidise the north. By the mid-1820s, a union of opposition had formed in Belgium, uniting liberals and Catholic conservatives against Dutch rule.

So basically the catholic parts (except for Noord-Brabant and East Limburg which were under pressure of Willem II his army) seceded and formed a new state. They got their own king etc. et voilà.  

There are some specific reasons why the two largely Roman Catholic provinces Noord-Brabant and Limburg (east Limburg that is) are still part of the Netherlands today. The people of Noord-Brabant had sympathy for the Belgian revolution, but this was rather easily contained by the Dutch authorities.
Limburg was more difficult. Limburg joined the Belgian revolution (except for two cities which had dutch armies stationed) but was eventually split in two in the 1839 treaty of London. One part (in the east) went to the Dutch and the other to Belgium. There's more to it than just the above though, but nothing of which I think is relevant to the case of BiH.

And then you hilariously claimed:

&gt;No there were not murdered or raped or anything close

LOL except even Israeli historians admit it themselves:

&gt;What the new material shows is that there were far more Israeli acts of massacre than I had previously thought. To my surprise, there were also many cases of rape. In the months of April-May 1948, units of the Haganah [the pre-state defense force that was the precursor of the IDF] were given operational orders that stated explicitly that they were to uproot the villagers, expel them and destroy the villages themselves.

&gt;*According to your new findings, how many cases of Israeli rape were there in 1948?*

&gt;""About a dozen. In Acre four soldiers raped a girl and murdered her and her father. In Jaffa, soldiers of the Kiryati Brigade raped one girl and tried to rape several more. At Hunin, which is in the Galilee, two girls were raped and then murdered. There were one or two cases of rape at Tantura, south of Haifa. There was one case of rape at Qula, in the center of the country. At the village of Abu Shusha, near Kibbutz Gezer [in the Ramle area] there were four female prisoners, one of whom was raped a number of times. And there were other cases. Usually more than one soldier was involved. Usually there were one or two Palestinian girls. In a large proportion of the cases the event ended with murder. Because neither the victims nor the rapists liked to report these events, we have to assume that the dozen cases of rape that were reported, which I found, are not the whole story. They are just the tip of the iceberg.""

You don't need to teach me anything and without me linking this thread somewhere else, it would have only the half of the comments 17 hours after submitting the article than it has now. I just hinted at the other German about Germany's sensitive area. It has nothing to do with paying for it if you would have read your own article.
Macron said in the Sorbonne speech:

&gt;European democratic doubt – the doubt which the “no” votes in the French and Dutch referendums made us experience – put an abrupt end to that chapter. And I think we were wrong to move Europe forward in spite of the people. There was a time when we thought we had to, in a way, shake up our democracies by pushing Europe forward despite everything. That was a mistake, and that mistake was compounded by a lack of proposals: we twisted people’s arms and said, “careful, we’ll no longer be making proposals and we’ll no longer be coming to ask your opinion.” **And we entered that “glacial period” when France, like many others, was afraid to make proposals because it was afraid of something taboo, something dreadful: a treaty change.**

&gt;**The German taboo is financial transfers; the French taboo is treaty change. Ultimately, if we want Europe, both will happen, I want to reassure everyone of that, but we must stop being afraid of the people.** In terms of our approach, we must simply stop building our Europe in isolation from them. But we mustn’t fall into the trap of the populists or extremes, which consists in saying: “let’s ask the question in a simplistic way:  yes or no?”.  We know the answer: it is always “no”, whatever the question. We need to overhaul the European project, through and with the people, with much greater democratic stringency than a mere binary question.

4998,"Since this guy, whose username is an insult in local languages, is pretty vocal about this issue, and clearly chooses to omit certain information it would be wise to consider the following:

  
Croat President Elect Dragan Covic, for the past 4 years, was part of an alliance with Bosniak parties. Throughout this the Croats (10% of population, holders of 30% of power) were given governance of all instrumental positions in the country, including the key ministries such as internal security, judicial, finance and economy related. He used this position entirely to keep blocking the healthy functioning of the alliance aka the government in place, and instead decided to side with the radical Serbian parties on making the country entirely dysfunctional. To put it in perspective, these guys electoral candidate (HDZ) sides with the most prolific Russian puppet in the country who openly proclaims that we should never be part of NATO, who openly denies genocides in Srebrenica, who openly calls for succession and dissolution of the country, and who is on the sanction (black list) of USA (Worthwhile mentioning, HDZ which also holds power in Croatia is a big ally of USA, EU member and supposedly this progressive European party - lol) 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason he was (legally) overvoted is simply that. There are large numbers of people who don't want to be cornered into ethnic belonging and don't want to vote for propagators of the ethnic political feudalism that the parties such as HDZ and SDA or SNDS harbour. Having 33% of the power is a responsibility not just a right - this responsibility was misused by the minor ethnicity - thus enabling this event to occur. Otherwise, surely Komsic would have not chance of being elected, it really is a fruition of hard work that HDZ did to themeselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

The calls for ""death of democracy"" are in fact ironic - because all they are calling for is a system where the country would have 3 entirely independent elections going on, all equal in meaning, but nowhere near equality in representation - 10% of population would be able to single-handedly hold the country hostage to their views at any time, while the candidate who won the seat in fact propagates the idea of one citizen one vote ideology - which in fact would be a fair resemblance of a democracy.  

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, we have ultra rightist guys parading what the international tribunal has declared - flags of a war criminal organisation - and complaining about the death of democracy, all because their electoral candidate is one of the key regressive actors in the past 4 years of the country politics, and was prevented from having a seat in the presidency by the population who are tired of this ethnic circljerking and just want a normal functioning country.

We have voted in line of our constitution and being mad for not having your extreme right wing contester being picked is disrespectful to democracy. 

I find it crazy that we are being called oppressors when voting for the best candidate despite his/her ethnicity. The west balcans are so sick that when a move like this would be called wholesome anywhere in the rest of the world, has now come under scrutiny because we did not vote according to old tribalism. 

We are literally being slandered for choosing a good guy over a nationalist...

It is like saying that you have an obligation to vote for trump because you’re white, and voting any other race would be considered foul play because they are not yours to pick. Do you see how crazy this sounds?

Excuse me? See, this is the kind of shit I'm talking about it. Just to be clear, I'm not saying the aren't some bad apples, most likely above native UK's average. But Romanians (and EE citizens in general) actually add things. All the doctors and nurses (and other qualified people in general) that you get ready educated while we paid for their education and you didn't. Yes, British hospitals preferred to actively search and hire Romanian doctors with ready diplomas instead of educating your brits to become doctors. Also because most of people emigrating are actually of working age they contribute more to welfare than they receive. They work and pay a part of brits' pensions. No Romanian pensioner emigrated in UK and went to ask for a pension. So yes, financially Romanians (and other EEs) are a net positive.

5094,"&gt;True but let me remind you Turkish is an Altaic language, while for example Armenian and Farsi are Indo-European language. So even though Turkish uses latin letters, languages like Armenian, Greek, Farsi have much more to do with ""Latin Alphabet using languages"" because of the common Indo-european origin. I heard Kazakh language is transitioning to latin alphabet...

Turkish literacy rates when using the Arabic script was in the toilet, the literacy rate skyrocketed with the introduction of the Latin alphabet system. Same in regards to Azerbaijanis, some Azerbaijanis in Iran try to write Azerbaijani using the Farsi alphabet (which is a mutation from the Arabic alphabet) but it still does not work well.

Latin has served to be superior for Turkic languages, while Cyrillic also worked. Russian has accommodation for certain Turkic pronunciations,

Yeah, it's funny because here they just kept growing in the last few years, although I don't really understand why, I don't particularly like them and I don't know many people that do. 

Probably the largest grocery store chain in Romania right now is Profi, I don't know if by revenue, but definitely by sheer number of stores and employees. They have simply built a ridiculous number of stores, at least in my city, Timisoara, there are some stores which are basically within 10 minutes of walking of each other, it's absolutely ridiculous. They are relatively small compared to other grocery stores and a very limited selection of products, but since they are dirt cheap and have locations built close to commie blocks they are favored a lot by pensioners and other people who don't own cars. 

Other grocery store chains we have are Auchan, MegaImage, Kaufland, Lidl, Penny, Metro and that's about it. The market is mostly split between German and French retailers. The Germans used to have the upper hand, but now since Carrefour bought Billa and Auchan bought Real, the French are probably in front. We also used to have Plus, Spar and Artima, but they got canibalized by the others. ",Romania,/r/europe/comments/9n8tnz/lidl_frenzy_in_serbia/e7lqp15/,pulicafranaru,1539298509

Why should Germany or Europe be required to do so and what do they profit from it?

Teachers should have no business expressing their political views to children because that is indoctrination, regardless of your ""intentions"".

Yeah.. no thanks, it would be a huge mess, interests are hugely different. 
For example no one in Portugal is willing to die fighting in Eastern Europe for the sake of the ""EU security"" (nothing is tying us together, except the fact that we live on the same continent)

All EU seems to do is being reactive to popular news / opinions. 

* Immigrant dies? Shit, let 1 or 2 million of them in.

* 2-3 years later, people hate immigrants, nationalists are winning elections? EU must focus on solving the immigration problem, make sure they only talk about that even though it stopped being a problem 2 years ago, the illegal immigration is not what it has been in 2015.

5261,"I never mentioned the pigment of anyones skin. I mentioned culture, two different things. 

Northern, Western Europe, and even Eastern Europe have undoubtedly derived from Christian values. It affects the way our society is structured, how we think, and how we act. Poles may be more traditional, but they are more Christian; thus relating to Europe much easier than most Africans or Middle Easterners. They may have far right ideals and be unwelcoming, but Christianity is by far the least aggressive religion today. I.E. look at what the Buddhists in Myanmar are doing to Muslims.

Many Asians have been oppressed under communism where they don't value any God over the state, not ideal, but over all a bit better and any religious extremist. I myself am not religious, but I understand its history and place in the world.

Turks are a bit more ""Western"" than many from countries like Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Iran again this is why the world ""culture"" is important and not ""color"".This could be because of their history with Christianity and it being where ""East meets West"" and where most of our modern world had developed..again culture...not color.

Yes, cultures change and adapt which is why I am strongly against the adaptation of sharia law in the western world or theocraric government. Which is why I am strongly against communism in the western world. Which is why I am strongly against facism or dictatorships. You're only indicating that things will get better, while I am saying that things could get worse. I appreciate your positivity but maybe it's better to understand that not everyone thinks like you and that probably the majority of the world holds way more ""traditional"" values than you think. We do not all get along. We do not all cherish playing music and looking at art. We do not all think that women are equal to men. We do not all think that gays have the right to marry.

While I do believe the difference of opinion is essential for a strong democracy, but first we must subscribe to the idea of democracy.

Finally, the spread of ideas didn't happen because people were sharing them out of love and respect for their fellow man. Ideas spread because of war and persecution, they spread because people stole them and adapted them, they spread because they were forced to believe in them or death. Your vision of history is again quite positive and that's really nice of you.

&gt;No they aren't, hardly any live here. Even as far as 2007 many of them were being deported:  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes they were asked to leave, multiple times, as the article above points out in detail.

Yeah, they were asked by Croats and Serbs to leave, not by Muslims.

In a 2005 interview with U.S. journalist [Jim Lehrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lehrer), Holbrooke stated:

&gt;There were over 1,000 people in the country who belonged  to what we then called Mujahideen freedom fighters. We now know that  that was al-Qaida. I'd never heard the word before, but we knew who they  were. And if you look at the 9/11 hijackers, several of those hijackers  were trained or fought in Bosnia. We cleaned them out, and they had to  move much further east into [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan).  So if it hadn't been for Dayton, we would have been fighting the  terrorists deep in the ravines and caves of Central Bosnia in the heart  of Europe.

There an in fact 741 Jihadists who were given Bosnian citizenship after the war:

Which doesn't mean there are not at least a couple hundered more without citizenship living in Bosnia.

The fact that your argument was: ""Hey, there are some, but not so many"" is hilarious.

You didn't refute:

\- The fact that Al-Qa'ida was trained and operated from Bosnia, see above

\- Didn't refute the fact that they were brought in by Izetbegovic

\- Didn't refute the fact that there are training camps for kids, where they teach kids how to fight in jihad:

Second Polish Republic did not claim places like Prague or Cottbus basing their claim on the fact because some Polish ruler used to control is several centuries ago, and Western Slavs used to live there back then.

Because that would be the closest comparison with the Republic of Lithuania claims against Poland in the interwar period.

&gt;Poles got exactly what they asked for.

What we got though?

&gt;Just far more frequent in modern Lithuanian, Latin, old Greek or Sanskrit languages.

Nobody cares, it's still a modern language just like any other and there's nothing special about it.

&gt;Rather be German than Pole.

Well, historiclal Lithuanians appeared to wanted to be pretty much anyone, including Poles, but not Lithuanians.

&gt;Yeah, just like USSR didn't annex Lithuania. It was equal union that we totally legitimately joined.

The only way in which the 1919 coup would be an annexation attempt would be if Polish army actually followed on it and entered Lithuania to annex it.

&gt;He's one of the major ones.

His party was quite influential in the Polish parliament (that's the reason Riga peace treaty looked way worse than it could have looked like), but Dmowski himself was never a prime minister, nor ruled the country.

&gt;You forgot to include three words - ""Under Polish aegis"".

Well, in the same way one could say that the current EU is ""Under German aegis"" I guess.

&gt;No. We wanted Lithuanian state made by Lithuanians,

Well, that's what your borders in 1919-July 1920 and October 1920-1939 were.

&gt; with Lithuanian and former Lithuanian lands. 

And now it turns out that Lithuanian vision of their state, and the let's-not-commit-genocide-or-ethnic-cleansing visions were mutually incompatible. Why stop only on ""former Lithuanian lands"" though, go all in! Claim Rome, San Francisco, Vladivostok and Western Australia as well!

&gt;Just like Polish corridor was very important for SPR.

Unlike Memel, the Polish corridor (i.e. the areas that Poland actually got in Versailles) was majority Polish. The city of Gdańsk/Danzig wasn't, that's why it was made an independent country in the interwar period, and Poland had to build its own port in [Gdynia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdynia) anyway.

It's uh, definitely my post and not yours there. I must have misread. Pretty glad you didn't notice that.

&gt;He's an authoritarian who's dehumanizing certain groups of people to whip racist idiots into a populist fury to empower him to solidify his power and prevent anyone from holding him accountable while he continues to violate constitutional law.

He's a mercurial demagogue who's too incompetent, inconsistent, and ill established for me to consider him as subscribing to points of view that coincide with fascist ideology. His narcissism and greed are prime motivators, not his political ideology. His refusal to decry racists, his sexism, etc is incidental - if he's aligning with fascism, there's no calculation and mostly outside influence to blame. So I don't think he can really be considered one - I believe you're stretching the term and diluting it by trying to apply it to Trump. He could be considered a petty, fearful bigot - but his administration isn't a cohesively consistently fascist one, it just happens to incorporate some aspects of fascism while verging on some kind of...fucked up wealth-centric capitalism (maybe the wrong term, but he's clearly in this for the money and power rather than building a lasting political entity that could be considered fascist).

&gt;You apparently don't know jack poo.

I guess my view of his administration as incompetent, fleeting, and more a symptom than a source has led to my not considering Trump/his administration fascistic.

When people can live like this, there is nothing that can threaten them from the outside. Europeans could not
ever get convinced/converted to a way of living that provides less of said things. Economic growth may be higher
in China or wherever and population might decrease in Europe while growing elsewhere, but it doesn't matter as long 
as they can not provide their people a better life than we do to ours.


It kind-of-works already - although bumpy from time to time. Lets not forget:

other countries to be as close to them as people from their own countries.

5406,"&gt; I was talking about Russia, I wasn't talking about the other guys. Should I frame it with an exhaustive list of what everyone else is doing wrong just so I don't step on any toes? Gimme a break. 

One person derides Russia doing X. Another person says that NATO/US also did X. You then say that this is just whataboutism. No one asked **you** for an extensive list. Another person gave you that list and you accuse this person of engaging in whataboutism! 

&gt; And you don't know what strawman means, I wasn't strawmanning shit, what I said was the direct implication of your BS.

No. In no way was that an implication I was making or standing behind beyond your imagination. It was a strawman. I think all parties on the geopolitical stage should be held to the same standard. Getting away with wrong doing is not a part of that position. In geopolitics a double standard used to dish out punishment is an act of aggression. That situation needs to be avoided. 

&gt;  Injustice is being done upon you if don't get away with evil like the rest. That's no moral principle.. that's BS. 

Again, this is not what is being said. Double standards are inherently unfair if we have beforehand decided that all actors should receive equal treatment. When someone starts talking of the evil acts of Russia, and someone brings up that these acts are in the same line as acts committed by entities that received no punishment for it, then there is little left to conclude. Either you apply an equal standard or you are holding a double standard. ",,/r/europe/comments/9n08n3/europemilitary_defense_europeans_natos_members_vs/e7l03gq/,hanikrummihundursvin,1539276046

5412,"&gt; I love Portugal but Portugal's machismo culture is bullshit 

See, that's what I mean. Except when you actually try to inspect reality, it's easy to check that all evidence points out the opposite is true. 

[Murders per capita (100,000 inhabitants):](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#By_country)

     Sweden:   1.08 
     Portugal: 0.64

---

First let me make this very clear, because it hasn't gone through your head yet. Sweden came up with women-only festivals, due to confirmed reports of sexual assault by gangs, multiple times. Reports that have been silenced by the media for long. 

That's Sweden not Portugal. And that's just one piece of evidence (although a rather explicit and obvious one) for the whole picture. And that's a picture that is rather fucked up. Dismissing it in your arguments, while  criticising stats and bringing up stereotypes on southerners is pathetic. You have women only festivals due to rampant sexual violence by gangs that has been silenced for long. Until you're able to acknowledge such realities this conversations is useless. 

Now Portugal's machismo. 

Even if true, that doesn't necessarily correlate with sexual violence or violence in general. E.g. Sweden and Finland are known for having a fucked up relation with alcohol, and your weekend nights out have a terrible reputation. If we're going by stereotypes, I can also bring up that Portuguese are much more sociable and have an easy time with the opposite gender, while northerners stereotypically are much more anti-social and need to be shit-faced to ""flirt"" (if we can call it that). The latter is much more conductive to violence. 

Also in these stereotype based discussions you always forget how foreign Sweden is today. Are you going to argue all those Iraqi's in Sweden to be more likely to report violence than Portuguese, or less violent than us? Seriously... If you're going to talk of stereotypes you need to keep in mind you've brought it in some of the worse that exist in the world in terms of women's treatment. And that's part of Sweden now. That's part of the country. Much like those grenades that came from ex-Yugoslavia that keep blowing up in Sweden. That's part of the country. That's part of its culture now.  

 
But stereotypes aside, 

Look up stats. I have before. And once you start looking at various stats, there's a trend. And it's complicated to dismiss them all. You have a more violent society overall.

We have election season right now here in Hessen and in neighboring Bayern. The streets are plastered with signs saying ""Islam gehört nicht nach Bayern"" (""Islam doesn't belong in Bavaria"") and ""Kreuzpflicht"" (""A requirement for public buildings to have Christian crosses"").

As a teacher, I now have Muslim children asking me about these signs and other things the AfD is doing. To them, I'm usually one of few adult Germans *they know and that they could ask* about this. The curricula for the schools in Hessen actually explicitly state that it is my job to further their understanding of and participation in our society and democracy.

The goal of the AfD is to take away my ability to deliver context to these kids. They want to polarize the children as much as possible while taking away the ability of teachers to explain the difference between party propaganda and reality (i.e. rights and responsibilities of German residents as specified by the law).

I’m a staunch atheist and while I support religious freedom, I disgust how people try to indoctrinate others (Jehova Witnesses are the fucking worst). In reality though, I would support that much more than I would support the immigration of tens of thousands in Muslims whose religion is much more oppressive and detrimental to humanity.

5504," I'm just going to copy-paste a good explanation of why none of this matters. It might be slightly old, because it's now at the trilogue.

...

Firstly, Article 11 and 13 are now on their way to the Trilogue, where the EP, Commission and Council all take turns demolishing it and then it gets a vote in January. Before then we really don't know what the legislation will look like.

IT GETS EVEN BETTER

The older version of the directive talks about “the use of effective content recognition technologies” to identify infringing material, a phrase that’s now been removed from the text. Exemptions were also added specifically for sites like Wikipedia and GitHub, which both share a lot of user-generated content. 

So, all this hyped bullshit doesn't matter anyway because that content filter has been removed! 

But wait.. there's also Article 11, right?

BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR MEMES?

Article 11 essentially has been in place in some way since 2001. Hell, all article 11 does is say ""if a site demands money money to have embeds show copyrighted content they can have it"". Article 11 just reiterates that certain copryight sections of 2001, 2009 and 2012 still apply and that they should be used in a way that does not warp competition.

This has been in place for a few years already. So what happened?

Nothing. Because turns out once you demand money for embeds people will just... ban you from being embedded. Your page will disappear from search engines. Which means nobody will visit your page anymore. Which means no money for you. Demanding any form of money for embeds is a glorious way to shoot yourself in the foot.

You CAN do it, but doing so destroys your own business.

https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0593

Article 11 Protection of press publications concerning digital uses

1.Member States shall provide publishers of press publications with the rights provided for in Article 2 and Article 3(2) of Directive 2001/29/EC for the digital use of their press publications.

2.The rights referred to in paragraph 1 shall leave intact and shall in no way affect any rights provided for in Union law to authors and other rightholders, in respect of the works and other subject-matter incorporated in a press publication. Such rights may not be invoked against those authors and other rightholders and, in particular, may not deprive them of their right to exploit their works and other subject-matter independently from the press publication in which they are incorporated.

3.Articles 5 to 8 of Directive 2001/29/EC and Directive 2012/28/EU shall apply mutatis mutandis in respect of the rights referred to in paragraph 1.

4.The rights referred to in paragraph 1 shall expire 20 years after the publication of the press publication. This term shall be calculated from the first day of January of the year following the date of publication.

Well what is Directive 2001/29/EC in paragraph 1 they refer to? https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:167:0010:0019:EN:PDF

Article 2

Reproduction right

Member States shall provide for the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent repro- duction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part:

(a) for authors, of their works;

(b) for performers, of fixations of their performances;

(c) for phonogram producers, of their phonograms;

(d) for the producers of the first fixations of films, in respect of the original and copies of their films;

(e) for broadcasting organisations, of fixations of their broad- casts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.

And further

Article 3

Right of communication to the public of works and right of making available to the public other subject-matter

(2) Member States shall provide for the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the making available to the public, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them:

(a) for performers, of fixations of their performances;

(b) for phonogram producers, of their phonograms;

(c) for the producers of the first fixations of films, of the original and copies of their films;

(d) for broadcasting organisations, of fixations of their broad- casts, whether these broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.

Article 5 as mentioned earlier is about exceptions to the rule, such as (but not limited to):

 • transport of copyrighted data over a third party (so the ISP has to pay no fees)

 • private copies in uncommercial use are exempt

 • libraries

 • preservation archives

 • teaching and education

 • promotion of these works (even if you do it on your own accord)

 • parody

 • demonstration how to repair it

 • national exception of the member states. Most member states have a certain ""fair use"" right.

Article 8 of the 2012 directive is just about dates when things come into effect: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:299:0005:0012:DE:PDF

mutatis mutandis means ""shall apply with all changes negotiated later on""

5526,"&gt; Or when talking just about Polish side of the commonwealth.

Usually the name ""Crown of Kingdom of Poland"" is used in such circumstances. Kingdom of Poland was smaller. It is somewhat unclear if Prussia, Red Ruthenia or even Mazovia were part of Kingdom of Poland, or were just lands of Crown of Kingdom of Poland.

This is actually quite interesting if we think about P-L union. Polish side was clearly trying to push not for incorporation of GDL into Kingdom of Poland (at least in times of Lublin Union) but made it one of the Lands of Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. That's why they were trying to name joint Sejm ""Sejm Koronny"". Lithuania opposed. 

So after some time the situation was quite ridiculuois. Because often, as you said, the whole PLC was called simply ""Kingdom of Poland"", while Polish part was called ""Crown of the Kingdom of Poland"".

The two were caught by police this summer, at a music festival. At that time, Claudiu Popa denied the accusations aimed at him and his former lover. 

According to Libertatea, the two were caught on August 11th with two cannabis cigarettes at the Summer Well festival in Buftea, Ilfov County. Around 17:00 police identified Claudiu Popa as he was found with two hand made cigarettes that contained traces of organic matter, with a strong odour. Next to him was Emma Zeicescu. After filling the official record, the officers measured and sealed the two cigarettes. The file was initially investigated by the Service for Combating Organized Crime (SCCO) in Ilfov and was eventually handed to a prosecutor from the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT).

Actually, I suspect that the market will take care of that pretty quickly.

I maintain that what has changed, is not that there is an epidemic of misbehaviour (spoiler: there isn't), it's that lots of women are no longer prepared to just ignore the minority of creepy men that have always been around but used to get away with it.

5701,"&gt; And please don't tell other people what they think, it's not nice. Harassment can be tactile OR verbal, my friend - whether you'd like to believe it or not. As I said in a response to someone else here:


Of course it can. But there are obvious limits and proper context plays a big role. 

An attractive guy approaching you in a pub and putting his hand on your waist with a 'Hey' is not sexual harrasment. Nor will most women take it as such.

There are obviously moments where 99% of women would view such sxua approaches as very appealing and using the legislative system to ban them or punish men for even trying them is dmb.

&gt; You think a 40 year old man commenting on a 12 year old's breast size in relation to his wife's is not harassment? I didn't think it either back then - but I sure think so now, because I really, really vividly remember how uncomfortable that comment made me feel and why I avoided that house for years after. Times are a'changing, mate. 

That is a strawman. That is not what I am talking about. Of course it is not acceptable to comment on a sub 18s looks.

My whole point is the line is so blurry and inconsistent that it is preposterous to try and legislate it.

Do you know what is the difference between a creep and a stud? Attractiveness. Two guys can do exactly the same thing and it not be harassment for one of them.

5877,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope#Non-fallacious_usage

There is ample evidence that gun control always gets stricter over time without fucking end in every nation. Canada, the UK, Australia, the EU, states like California, New York, etc.

Slippery slope is only a fallacy when there is no proof or repeated precedence of A leading to B. This isn't the case for guns.

The justification for these laws is because of the terror attacks and smuggled weaponry. This is because border controls are pathetic. Schengen undermines security.

&gt;muh usa, muh rednecks

There are already regulations on guns in Europe. Your hyperbole is moot. Switzerland is a much safer nation than the Netherlands. So is Austria and the Czech Republic. All have more liberal laws. 

Is there a risk with guns? Yes. Freedom always comes with a risk and cost to society. This is why tens of thousands of people can die from alcohol-related deaths in your nation every year, but if someone were to propose an 800% increase on alcohol taxes and consumption to be limited to places that are licensed to serve it, there would be an uproar. Society deems that cost acceptable so they can get drunk and have fun with friends.

Thus it's not about whether there should be a cost. It's about what the cost should be. Stop assuming your attitude reflects every European. You will always have people who care about their rights and liberties. Many people would not want to live in a society where anything that poses the slightest risk is banned, extremely restricted or heavily taxed. Most Swiss voted against more gun control in 2011.

Yes, this is a massive infringement on the liberties of European gun owners.",,/r/europe/comments/9n7r6x/how_to_buy_a_gun_in_switzerland/e7kbqbm/,cdngunownerthrowaway,1539247826

It doesn’t come down to actual harassment numbers as much as how willing society as a whole are to accept and help people who have been sexually harassed. 

Just look at the Kavanaugh trial and the results of that.

Electric cars and heat pumps emit more CO2 than their alternatives in most European countries, simply because they use coal or gas to generate their electricity.

Solar and wind are not carbon free because they are only available less than 50% of the time. They require gas or coal back up the rest of the time. We do not have an economical viable solution for storage of electricity.

Hydro and nuclear are the only technical solutions that provide carbon free electricity. For mass hydro power projects we have a chronic shortage of mountains. Even Switzerland doesn’t have enough mountains and rainfall to go full hydro.

The planned end of nuclear power in Belgium will according to specialists increase the country’s CO2 emissions with 78%. Nobody cares. It is not on the news. Not a single political party has this on the radar.

This way we can remain a sovereign state and only ever have to do things voluntarily. Coercion by any means necessary is unheard of historically. 

That's why things such as the financial crisis were a breeze, as countries decided to fuck each other over because they didn't have a common legal framework - decided beforehand and able to balance power differentials - to do things within the EU. Instead, they invented everything ad hoc using magnificent intergovernmental methods.
