22,"Yes. Part of it is also just optics. The Netherlands has huge pension funds. As in larger than the entire Dutch GDP, last figure I heard was around 1.5 trillion euro. And of course mortgages (which are high), but there is collateral in the form of houses that offsets that. The interest on all that private debt is pretty low considering they are mortgages. If you look at the composition of debt, debt primarily used for consumption (like creditcard debt) is low in the Netherlands. Our mortgages are high, but the interest is deductible from your income so you don't even pay the full rate. I have a big mortgage, but my interest payments are far far lower than what I would need to pay if I wanted to rent the house. Less than half at least, probably closer to a third. So optically I have high debt, but I also have high equity and the debt service is very affordable and the loan has a 30 year duration so there is no need to rollover either.",,/r/europe/comments/h0ccdm/eu_members_are_split_on_the_750_bilioneuro/fton1d3/,GrandAdmiralSnackbar,1591873570

66,"I assume that you're misinterpreting this on purpose. 

&gt;This is one of their president's tantrums against the EU (subs in eng.), and that was when he was given almost ‚Ç¨100m to get equipment for battling coronavirus. In the same video he praised his brother Xi Jinping.

When Vuƒçiƒá threw his tantrum, there were active export restrictions of medical equipment from the EU. 

It was never about the money, but about the fact that you simply had nowhere to go in order to buy equipment. This isn't specific to Serbia either, there were many reports of shipments being intercepted and confiscated, or suppliers canceling in the last moment for a higher bidder. 

When the crisis hit, the knee jerk reaction in Europe was everyone for themselves. That was the first impression, and although the EU scrambled to try to fix those optics, first impressions do matter. 

Various voices in the EU lamented how they are losing the propaganda fight against China and Russia in their own backyard, and Vuƒçiƒá exploited those fears. 

I think it's also dishonest to label this as a problem of shaping the narrative, but a problem of actions. The EU countries should have done a better job among themselves from the get go. 

The 100 million figure was money that was earmarked for other things, and was then approved for coronavirus response. It's not like that money simply materialized on our accounts, it's long term aid. 

&gt;He then used European money to buy medical equipment from China but media narrative was made in order to look like that were Chinese donations.

I don't know what Serbian media you consumed, but the state media actually focused on the fact that the Serbian state is buying a lot of equipment in preparation. Of course, donations were reported on when they happened. 

China also sent their own experts, and the perception of people coming here to help goes a long way than just money. 

&gt;This is the first cargo that came from China. Yes, that one little packet was all that came but all the media were screaming about Chinese help.

119,"I wrote my thesis on the subject. Some politicians, ill informed, mention the possibility of a border correction from time to time. Is is not illegal, it is not impossible (anything could happen) but it is extremely unlikely and extremely dangerous.

See the Kosovo-Serbia corrections as Pandora's box. You start there and show it's an acceptable solution and now you have similar claims for a greater Serbia (Republika Srpska and we could add the Serbs in different municipalities in Krajina and why not the Serbs in Montenegro). You have greater Croatia with Croats of BiH. You have greater Bulgaria as well eying Macedonia and maybe part of South Serbia. You have greater Albania, that would be Albania, Kosovo and the Western part of Macedonia. And why not also thinking of greater Hungary with the Hungarian minority in Croatia and in Vojvodina.

As you see it's a complex issue and there's no stopping at possible redrawings. It would send a very negative signal to countries in the Balkans but in the world as well. And many people see this as a legal ethnic cleansing.
Let's not forget that even if borders are redrawn, Kosovo and Serbia will not receive 100% ethnically unified territories and that there will still be Albanians in Serbia and Serbs in Kosovo (they might be affected extremely negatively by a border correction btw alongside other minorities of Kosovo)

At the end of the day EU membership requires appetite for cooperation. If countries cannot show their appetite for cooperation when dealing with their national minorities or at the regional level I hardly see how they will be able to face the challenges of EU membership.
Ideally, being a EU MS is about cooperation and working together not always being selfish and thinking of one's own interest.

I doubt the redrawing is the easier solution in that case, even if it is the easier solution to sell to most Serbs. But it would have terrible regional consequences (I spoke only of the Balkans but similar claims could arise elsewhere in Europe) and would weaken the EU stances on the international scene. Being part of the EU entails looking for the best outcome for the EU, your neighbors, your citizens abroad etc... Not just for yourself. And in my opinion redrawing the border is the best outcome for Serbian politicians, this way they'll gain more political points but in no way it would be good for the EU or countries in the region and it would jeopardize the relative stability of minorities in the Balkans and in the EU. I just can't see this as a positive outcome.",,/r/europe/comments/h0iyo2/who_gives_the_most_aid_to_serbia/ftofl50/,stadelafuck,1591866382

how much of an average Russian bills is electricity, and how much the things I mentioned (food, home appliances, car costs, you know the ones that cost the same as Europeans pay)? 

I pay 15 Euros for my electricity for my 2 room apartment in Estonia, In Germany I paid 25 something. how much cheaper is equivalent in Russia? 5 Euros less? 10 Euros less?? Does that matter in the bigger scheme of things?

https://en.selectra.info/energy-france/guides/electricity/cost

''With the average household in France consuming about 4670 kWh electricity (in French) in 2015, the average annual electricity cost in France ranged from 773.95‚Ç¨ - 731.38‚Ç¨, depending on the electricity provider and plan chosen. This works out to an average monthly power bill of about about 66.50‚Ç¨ - 60‚Ç¨ per month.'' - LOL It doesnt say what kind or apartments of homes were are talking about there. How big they are???

206,"&gt; For years, the EU has warned Italy about it's reckless expenditure and dangerous debt building exactly for the reasons we are in now. It's flat out unfair to expect the countries that followed the rules to now pay for southern foolishness.

It's not completely true though. Italy has been one of the EU countries with the most self-inflicted austerity since the 1990s. They've constantly ran primary budget surpluses, while most other countries (including the Netherlands) ran deficits. The issue is that austerity is a bad policy when it stifles economic growth. You could repay a bit of your debt every year, but if your GDP doesn't grow enough, your debt/GDP won't improve. Running larger deficits and using that money to increase GDP growth could have resulted in a lower debt/GDP ratio at the end.

And as a ""nation"" with little to no Serbs living in it at all, I'm sure you get the irony in trying to gain a higher moral ground here.

&gt; culturally assimilated 

And when was this? Because I still remember my parents telling me how they all had a little line on their paycheck which stated how much of their money went to Kosovo for the improvement of infrastructure and overall well being of the poorer populace living there.

When the first student protests erupted in Kosovo, it's because a lot of you folks wanted to lean towards the flavor of communism practiced by Enver Hoxha.

As stated in the University of California's publication by Julie A. Mertus in 1999:

&gt;*A university education was no guarantee of a successful future; instead of training students for technical careers, the university specialized in liberal arts,* ***in particular in Albanology****, which could hardly secure work except in bureaucracy or local cultural institutions, especially outside of Kosovo.* ***This created a large pool of unemployed but highly educated, and resentful, Albanians ‚Äì prime recruits for nationalist sentiment.***

Is this the cultural assimilation we're talking about? Because you can get the same kind of spiel from the Croatian and Serbian nationalists of the time, because Tito didn't allow anything which strayed away from the official policy of ""brotherhood and unity"".

All in all, stop trying to claim a moral high ground here and stop trying to look outraged whenever someone disputes the claim of Kosovo's independence. You're no better than the triggered idiots in Serbia.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/h0iyo2/who_gives_the_most_aid_to_serbia/fto89d2/,bureX,1591859383

Your total population shrank to an incredible 7.000.000 in plain numbers, your private sector is almost none-existent, foreign EU states have settled there for the purpose of sponging as much brainpower and cheap manual labor as they can. The EU does have **some** unbalanced positive aspects like bringing direct investments towards improving the infrastructure or the rule of law **HOWEVER** the negative aspects outweigh the positive once. Being in direct control of the Berlin means getting rid of the local Administrations and completely undercutting the bank resources. Your BDP might raise a bit but that's only because of the foreign investment influx, compare that to a sovereign country with very few corruption government barriers and you've got yourself a very rich and stable domestic economy. There's nothing worse than having someone else's firms rooted in your own nation that are quite literally sucking out your precious resources. We're also aware that the EU quite possibly will collapse in the near future so a decision to join has to rely on rational thoughts and planning. Bulgaria is not and never will be a financial EU partner, the EU took Bulgaria as a strategic spot of geopolitical influence. I don't think it's ""logical"" to completely let go if your southern border and let go of the local authority in hopes that the average wage might bump into a 900 Euro mark... i'm simply stating the fact that even if you do hit that sweet spot it's still not enough for a country to enjoy all the benefits of the west.

You can usually see those kids (some of them of my age, 21, some of them either younger or older, sadly) putting 3 fingers in the air when taking pictures, because if you don't do that you are not Serbian, saying that NATO bombing is unprovoked, whilst completely ignoring Serbian genocidal atemps in Kosovo, saying that people that commited war crimes are heroes, that people who killed possibly only politician after Tito who was smart, briht and worth something, Zoran Djindjic (who was prime minister at the time of his assassination), were heroes, saying that Croatians are catholic Serbs, Bosnians are muslim Serbs (whilst again ignoring the fact that they were under Ottomans for 500 plus years), hating Albanians because they look like Ottomans and Turks, also thinking that first organisms on Earth were Serbs then came amoebas (this is a joke that went around Slovenia, I think, after Yugoslavia fell apart, that is, sadly, sometimes true) and I can keep going and going. The next biggest problem is that those kids who grew up with those parents will some day have their kids and continue that thinking, unless they use their brain to think, which is something that, I think, won't happen anytime soon, is actually what is stopping Serbia from making any progress that will make a noticeable difference. Aslo I might add that right now there are some disputes in Montenegro about a ""Serbian"" orthodox church, which Serbia got to claim, as a prize for WW1 efforts. The problem being that Serbia just claimed it, or we can say put their flag there, but forgot to document it, and now that Montenegro is not a part of Serbia anymore, leagally that church belongs to them and they want it to be Montenegrin Orthodox Church, which actually is, but in Serbia they say otherwise, they are almost, and when I say almost, I mean it, calling for another war because of it and the line is very thin. Plus that Montenegro was one of the first countries that was Corona-Free and now Serbia is opening borders with everyone except Montenegro. Why? Montenegro doesn't allow it. Why? Because in Serbia there are more and more people positive on it and they don't want them in Montenegro. And now Serbia is all like, they took our churches, they want to stop Serbs, bla bla bla, and now they don't want Serbs to spend their vacations in Montenegro because they hate us, and they are spreading this propaganda, and those dumb people and their kids actually believe this and can possibly make a big problem here. As for my stand on it, I stand by Montenegro and I agree with them, the church wasn't built by Serbs and isn't on Serbian soil plus isn't documented as Serbian therefore can't be Serbian and can only be Montenegrin and as for the virus, same thing, they are free of it, why would they risk spreading it again. Wait for it to go away and then travel. Easy. Also current president is, and I mean this seriously, is the most normal politician in Serbia, sadly, who is actually doing something he says, even if it's 10-20%, whilst others are just nationalist who run their mouth. Also he fantasizes about being a dictator, and probably gets aroused when thinking about it.

Hitler *was* worse you dipshit. No need to be ironic about it, whatever sin communism bears, Nazism has a far darker one.

I am literally from Bessarabia and Bucovina. Grandparents born in Berlintsi, Briceni Raion, (Northern Moldova). I was born in Chernovtsi, Bucovina. 

You know what happened in 1941 in those two places? Fucking Romanian fascists and Hitlerian fascists came in. They killed all the Jews, then slowly started deporting Slavs to Germany wherefrom they never came back (work in slave factories). Berlintsi means Little Berlin, we were a mostly a Jewish village. Chernovtsi used to be a plurality Jewish city, it was very multiethnic, but Jews were the most numerous.

You know what's particularly vile? In Berlintsi my paternal grandfather witnessed the first massacre of the Jews. They lined them up by turns outside the village bathhouse. Right here. And started shooting. But what's vile is that the Germans organised all this, but it was the Romanians who did the killing. Romanians were like rabid dogs, they would kill Jews in all the towns they came in like fucking animals. Germans were evil, but they were orderly and calculating about it, Romanians simply acted like animals. My great-grandparents housed German soldiers, they took away their farm animals but they didn't mistreat my grandparents like Romanians would. Granted, Germans still raped a swathe through our land and killed a good portion of us, Germans were still by far the greater evil. It's Romanians that were more contemptible though.

And why? Because fascism. Fascism is far worse than communism, fascism is a base, animalistic, regressive ideology. Tribal genocidal maniacs. When, pray tell me, did Soviet communism seek to root out entire ethnic groups by killing every man, woman and child? Nazism however did, and was damned effective -- where I am from, we're as Judenfrei as you can be. I *wish* Nazis merely deported Jews to Madagascar or something. But no, they killed us.

In the past few years you could only see Vuƒçiƒá on TV appearances and no one else. If we'd get only fifteen minutes each night of seeing opposition politicians, and the government would be dismantled when people see through all the lies they've been fed. 

People are not being properly informed and that's why many people think we're actually getting better while in reality we're not. Imagine China but in a bit smaller scale.

There were so many political scandals by SNS (Srpska Napredna Stranka, Vuƒçiƒá's political party) that I couldn't even remember and list them all now. 

At the top of my head, Belgrade floodings. The sewer system is fucked and not being repaired/upgraded. Each year we've been getting floodings in the whole capital. Last year his excuse was that it was a once in a hundred years rain. What could he do? (prepare maybe?)

Guess what happened this year? Yep, Belgrade flooded again. Nothing being done about it still. It's sad.

Then there was the illegal arms trading which included non other than our minister's father. Marijuana plantation at a site that has connections to Vuƒçiƒá's brother. Fake diplomas. Phantom firms. Opposition journalist Oliver Ivanoviƒá being murdered and no progress in bringing justice. Illegally lowered pensions. The helicopter accident... etc.

Radio Free Europe isn't funded to provide news and facts. They are funded to promote US foreign interests. Sometimes those two may align but not always. 

Here is the mission statement from the legislation commissioning RFA which is similarly incorporated and state funded like RFE:

&gt;&gt;The continuation of existing U.S. international broadcasting, and the creation of a new broadcasting service to people of the People's Republic of China and other countries of Asia, which lack adequate sources of free information and ideas, **would enhance the promotion of information and ideas, while advancing the goals of U.S. foreign policy**.

429,"&gt;The majority of fish caught in UK waters are not from the UK quota. It is EU boats fishing under their own quotas in UK waters.

I'll review it again, but I believe the result will be the same. If you have solid info (i.e., NOT news articles from UK tabloids), please share it with me.

&gt;Once the UK exits the Transition period all quotas under the CFP will be null and void

In the UK waters, yes. In fact, it should have already happened on February of this year.

&gt;With no deal no EU boats will be able to fish in UK waters. That's how EEZs work unless there is an agreement.

Yeah. And the UK would not receive any money for it's licensing scheme either.

&gt;The UK will institute it's own system of licensing.

But it already had one, 100% British! And that has been the issue!

&gt;The UK has said it may be prepared to continue some access (but not to the present level)

OK.  And if it continues yearly license system that has been used until now, there is no problem.

&gt;and as an independent coastal state will negotiate on overall catches with neighbouring states. 

It is what it has been doing for decades. The EU basically only limited the number of captures to avoid overfishing.

&gt;For EU members this means the EU.

Exactly. It was the UK who wanted to negotiate with individual EU members. And failed.

&gt;The EU wants to continue with EU boats taking the largest share of fish from UK waters, like the UK has not left the EU....

Using the licensing system with quotas that the UK created. Being several countries, it would not surprise me that they, collectively, had a bigger quota. Specially, seeing the sorry state that the UK fishing industry is in due to the decisions of the British government.

&gt;Anyone sane can see that position is madness.

No. It simply wants to find a way to operate in a way similar to what it has had until now. Which is a logical position to have.

&gt;Whatever happens EU access to UK waters is going to fall dramatically

Well... as long as the UK accepts that by doing so, it is losing negotiation power, it is fine. I guess.

&gt;The remaining UK fishermen do not fish in EU waters so the EU cannot offer reciprocal rights as they are worthless to the UK.

But even the UK fishermen *sell* a large percentage of their captures to the EU. And unless they want those products to be rendered uncompetitive due to tariffs, the UK will have to negotiate with the EU. And, yes, it is a stupid ""catch 22"", but it is one that the UK created for itself.",Basque Country (Spain),/r/europe/comments/h0e4qv/britain_asks_too_much_of_eu_in_brexit_talks/ftnqpap/,JosebaZilarte,1591846189

And please, dont talk about the churches. Destroying Albanian mosques, houses, etc was a national pastime of Serbs. 

&gt; Do you know what happened in ww2 and before in ottoman empire

I know what happened. In WW2, A LOT of Albanians fought with the partisans, seemingly for a common cause against a common enemy. Then the Albanian faction was later betrayed and massacred after the war. 

Also, what about the Ottoman Empire? Serbs enjoyed way more rights than Albanians, and incomparably so. Then, after the treaty of St Stefano, Serbia mass-expelled Albanians from the region of Nis and below. 

But no, it didnt stop there. After taking the land from Albania in a treaty not involving Albania (a bit unfair isnt it?), Serbia proceeded to yet again expel the Albanian population, this time by forcing them to immigrate to Turkey.

Kosovo didnt even enjoy basic human rights until the 60s.

Unfortunately, it doesnt stop there either. After Kosovo finally got recognized as an autonomous province 1974, that surely didnt stop Serbia. 

Hell would freeze before Serbia would let Albanians live like normal fucking human beings. This time, it only took 15 years for Serbia to literally overthrow Kosovo's parliament, installing their own, and rescinding Kosovo's autonomy, before closing down ALL Albanian language schools, and firing ALL Albanians from the public sector, forcing them to either leave, or die. 

Unfortunately, it didnt stop there either. In 1999, Serbia had expelled 800k Albanians from Kosovo in a span of 1 week, burning entire villages and mosques in the process. 

Then there's [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Christ_the_Saviour,_Pristina) beauty, which was constructed during the biggest tensions, in the plot of the university, in the center of a 90% muslim region, for the sole purpose of humiliating Albanians.

After all that shit, you have the AUDACITY to complain about a few churches and a few hundred serbs? Fuck outta here.

We have to live with the memories of tens of our family members getting raped and killed, most of whom have never even been returned. Serbia sends one body per year to the families, just so they can keep the wounds fresh you sick bastards.

The UK has said it may be prepared to continue some access (but not to the present level) and as an independent coastal state will negotiate on overall catches with neighbouring states.

Jawaharlal Nehru, first leader of independent India, was an avowed socialist. He made no secret of the fact. 

Nehru acclaimed to the Lahore Congress in December 1929 that he was a ‚Äòa socialist and republican‚Äô. In 1927, at the Brussels Congress he was made an honorary president of the openly marxist-leninist League Against Imperialism, and later that year visited Moscow for a four day visit to explore the practical application of socialism and communism. 

He said of his time in among the socialists and communists of Europe that: ‚ÄúMy outlook was wider‚Ä¶ without social freedom and a socialistic structure of society and the state neither the country nor the individual could develop muc

in the 1950s they followed socialist creed and the state seized control of steel, mining, machine tools, water, telecommunications, insurance, and electrical plants, among other industries

The Banks came next. 

In 1950 there were 430 commercial banks in India. In 1955 the Imperial Bank in India was nationalised and renamed the State Bank of India. In 1969 all commercial banks holding over Rs.50 crores (just over ¬£200m in modern money) were nationalised. The 14 largest transferred 70 per cent of deposits into Indira Gandhi‚Äôs hands. In 1980 all remaining banks were nationalised. 

It was called ‚ÄòSocial Control‚Äô and Prime Minister Desai said it would mean India‚Äôs politicians could ‚Äúregulate our social and economic life so as to attain the optimum growth rate for our economy and to prevent at the same time monopolistic trend, concentration of economic power and misdirection of resources.""",,/r/europe/comments/h07jgf/june_1941_the_first_wave_of_soviet_deportations/ftndi9h/,Naefux,1591838812

This rail line was to be a hallmark project of Beijing‚Äôs Belt and Road initiative ‚Äî a shining example that China could carry out massive infrastructure projects in Europe the right way (i.e. the Brussels way).

Yes, the whole thing got delayed but as far as I  know a large part of the route in Serbia is ready or being worked on. I am not saying that China is not expanding their soft power with those loans they give but it is a FACT that China has a massive project being build in the country.

And what's your article saying? 3.6 bil grants + 4.8 bil loans were given and for that 3 bridges and bunch of waste management plants were build + stuff like unknown number of ambulances were bought and border crossings were renovated. Rest just says I quote

&gt;A mark of special trust between us is that in 2014 Serbia takes over management of EU funded projects. There are currently over 600 on-going projects under implementation covering a wide range of sectors for the overall benefit of Serbian citizens. Most of these projects are smoothly implemented and have the full commitment of the Serbian authorities and final beneficiaries.

Take a good look at the first sentence. As an Eastern European let me tell you something - every euro being given to Serbia is taken by the ruling clique. If anything is being build, it's of extremely poor quality, it costs 10 times more than it's usual price and it's probably a park in a God forgotten village just to pump the numbers of the projects.",–ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ —Ç—Ä–∏ –æ–∫–µ–∞–Ω–∞!,/r/europe/comments/h0iyo2/who_gives_the_most_aid_to_serbia/ftndqy1/,RammsteinDEBG,1591838937

&gt; Czechs: Polish army blocked access to the chapel. MON: The location of the post was the result of a misunderstanding 
&gt;
&gt; Czech media reported that Polish soldiers crossed the border to the Czech side and set a checkpoint there, blocking access to the popular chapel. We asked the Ministry of National Defense about the incident. ""The location of the post was the result of a misunderstanding, not a deliberate act, and was immediately corrected,"" reports the ministry.
&gt;
&gt; A few days ago, the Czech portal Denik , reported that Polish soldiers who were guarding the border due to coronavirus in Pilgrims, went to the Czech side and set up a checkpoint in front of the chapel in the village of Pelhrimov. The website also informed that the military did not allow the Czechs to approach it or take pictures with it. According to eyewitnesses, the soldiers were armed with ""submachine guns"". ""Gazeta Wyborcza"" also described it in Wroc≈Çaw.
&gt;
&gt; We have the answer of the Ministry of National Defense regarding the Czech chapel
&gt;
&gt; Denik portal reported that the mayor of Slezske Rudoltice commune stated that the Polish authorities had not consulted him about the decision to enter the Polish army. Czech ministries of foreign affairs and home affairs intervened in this matter. It turned out that there was a misunderstanding on the Polish side. We asked the Ministry of National Defense about it. In response, we received information from the press department that ""soldiers of the Polish Army are providing support to the Border Guard at the borders"". 
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The location of the post was the result of a misunderstanding, not a deliberate act, and was immediately corrected 
&gt;
&gt; -- confirmed the Ministry of National Defense . He added that ""it is not true that Polish soldiers forbid taking pictures of the shrine, but asked for not photographing the post itself.""

665,"&gt; What is this scenario where they can just break off if we dont give them enough money? They are the ones that receive more than they contribute. They have nowhere to go? Who is going to provide them with free money if they leave the EU? Have you any idea how expensive brexit has been so far? They cant even afford to begin to leave mate.

You assume the act would be rational. Evidence A: Brexit. Politics isn't rational and sometimes one has to indulge those irrationalities, if it is cheaper to act as those irrational things are given. One could huff and say ""that is irrational"", but it doesn't make the risk of action anyless real. Angry and desperate people don't act rationally.

So yeah we could say ""rationally, you aren't going to leave, here take a loan."" However that might end up costing EU as whole way more in power, prestige, economic weight etc. compared to just dishing out 750 billion Euros in rescue money around EU.

So yeah they might not afford to leave, but they might leap out anyway in case they are angry and desperate enough to essentially ""lets try something else, anything else, this current thing isn't workin"".

It is the ""Nixon is a lunatic in Whitehouse"" defense, only this time it is ""the population on country X is lunatic"" and well unlike Nixon, they might actually be lunatic enough.

You yourself provided best evidence: UK really can't afford to brexit, but decided to do it anyway. Thus it is actually rather real and intimidating possibility. Hence why EU and other members are dishing out money. It isn't a tactic really that bothers EU. Rather lack of tactic and situation ripping out of control, if economic situation starts to go to ""nation completely bankrupt, run on the banks and waiting for food riots to start"" levels.

'Aid' is basically a non-descript word for money to the common man but money is labled differently and some countries count some things to foreign aid, some others discount it. And different organizations count different things, like ODAs (Official Development Aid) in the OECD.

I'm guessing China doesn't really provide much ODAs but still invests tons of stuff into Serbia through other channels which is on similar terms but not counted officially as 'aid' by OECD and other organizations. For most people, money is money, they don't care how the accountants split up and categorize it. But they way it is counted and statisticians record it is very important in shaping a narrative.

I also didn't want to say that profit orientation is generally evil and you shouldn't strive for profit. I think it's problematic that profit is the primary drive for the economy. 

IMO it should be more important for an economy to be ethical and to serve public welfare, than to create profit. For example it should be more important that the environment is protected, that workers are paid decently and that you don't produce in countries where human rights are violated, than to create profits. I also believe that the real estate market shouldn't be mainly profit oriented in most cases. IMO it's more important that people can get affordable housing, than it is to create profits. 

Again I'm not saying that you should never strive for profit, but I think in many cases (in some industries more than others) there should be things that are more important than profit.

826,"No we dont agree haha!

The Dems/Republicans are different- it's a massive oversimplification to value the two too much imho.

The extreme polarisation of politics and the sabotage of the other's agenda is the problem in my view.

When Obama lost control of congress after the recession he couldn't achieve fuck all.

The effect of regionalism and contradictory objectives further stymies them.

But whilst a Dixie Democrat might as well be a Republican compared to a San Francisco Democrat, the two parties are still quite different, both very large and there still is choice.

If all was rosy in China they wouldn't have to silence free speech, have no independent trade unions, have no independent judiciary, lie about their GDP (???) amongst myriad other illiberal and totalitarian behaviours.

Take Hong Kong- why is it so important for China to assert itself now? They've been patient in the last it seems.

It is because the large, educated Chinese middle class with their VPNs - many the descendants of the Tiananmen protestors can see what they're missing.

A big clue was in the rare, widespread criticism of the lack of free speech when Corona virus broke out. 

When the whistleblowers were arrested and forced to sign confessions of rumour-mongering, but later died (or were even 'disappeared' in some cases) there was an outcry.

China's growth cannot go on forever, and has been slowing these last few years too.

Altho we are too often in awe of Chinese state power - their gov't's behaviour is that of fear of losing control.

And rightly so.

The world has moved from a unipolar balance of power to a multipolar one- that's what makes america look weak.

But Russia and China have to constantly suffocate all internal dissent - and I dont think that can last forever.

That's why particularly China support rioting an protests in America (online propaganda and misinformation) - to justify their own totalitarian control and 'shame' democracy.

Democracy has its issues - but the Chinese system has very wobbly foundations

And it's amusing how much you feel a need to defend yourself your double standard. There's no reason he wouldn't have made it into the gardai assuming he made it through the training, his background was clean and there were no red flags. I doubt anything like this would ever have happened if he worked in Ireland. It's a completely different world to US inner city policing. There's a reason all the focus is on Floyd not the cop right now, because there's nothing special about him. He's not some secret neonazi, he's not some closet racist who throws darts at pictures of black people. Racism being the motive is complete speculation hence the focus on systematic racism so that even if he personally isn't racist the system he represents make his actions so.  

I won't deny America tends to give its cops a lot of leeway, but that doesn't mean there's no due process at all and if you are going to pretend to value it you should at least value it everywhere equally.

910,"Well technically it all has to be paid back. Just not via direct loan back payments. Rather the loans are taken by EU. EU doesn't have taxing rights, so only place the loan payments can come from is from membership dues to EU. The next EU budget just will have massive extra component of taking loans and then over the years (bonds to cover this are 30 years, if I remember correctly) all EU members will pay extra.

So every member state who gets grant money has to pay atleast some of it back via their EU membership fees being little higher than without the grants. Ofcourse the part where this little bit more goes to ""charity"" is that most likely the back payments are done in same proportions as all other EU membership fees and not based on exactly how much money each Member state received.

This frees Commission to give money out based as the see needed, instead of based on ""how much direct debt is the state willing to accept"". Also it enables another interesting variety. Paying money to non state entities or multinational entities without having (most likely businesses and companies) without having to bicker about on exactly which member nations responsibility is to pay back this or that bit of the grants. Members communally pay back these grants and well it is rather philosophical question then is it ""charity"" in pure and simple or ""investment"" with a long and broad outlook.

Is universal healthcare among nations population charity or investment? Everyone pays into it atleast in some part, but in many cases how much of healthcare resources one use is in no way proportional to their tax contribution. Some support it based on pure principled ""charitable"" human rights view and well others might say ""healthy population is more productive"" so actually it is a long term investment.

1020,"when it comes to the equation of skin colour and extraterritorial oppression I emphasize again, as a Norwegian. And yes, there is a trend in western discourse to talk about democracy as if the whole continent had it to the same degree and quality. For instance when people say that the Putin administration is eroding a democracy, when there never was one (in the liberal parliamentarian understanding of the word), considering thy went from tsarism to socialism to the yeltsin coup in 1991 and the 1996 election which is a point of great debate. 

Look, Im not trying to speak authoritatively on the behalf of the Baltics, Im just observing certain trends from the limited view of an outsider. So if you have objection to my standpoint please refute: *"" there was an influx of nazis in the baltic resistance, for instance the forest brothers. This part of history is not being reviewed and judged correctly, instead being distorted in the sense that it downplays nazi collaborationist on the one hand, and violence against the leftist currents in the baltics under the soviets, on the other.""*

Again when talking about capitalist restoration, if we circle in on Estonia in particular, I have to be silent. Regarding the rest of the bloc, I linked an article about the liquidation of 2.5 million jobs in east germany and the subsequent silencing of leftist movements. When it comes to Russia, I think it's safe call it common knowledge that the Yeltsin admin agreed to most of the proposals that came with the billions of dollars in support from the Clinton admin during the restoration period.

1025,"&gt; Countries didn't have testing capacity and fast contact tracing system. 

Contact tracing is that useful against a contagious respiratory virus where most people who have it have minor cold like symptoms or are asymptomatic. Just think on a normal day how many people you are going to come into contact with, it is just not that viable. Even South Korea is not that relient on it and South Korea was lucky in identifying clusters quite early on. 

&gt;Primary reason for lock-down was to keep infections in country low enough so newly created system can handle that load.

No they were brought in as panic measures in fear that the hospitals from getting overwhelmed. Which hasn‚Äôt happened in most places even in places that were badly hit were still able to prepare for it. A virus can not really be controlled like this and it is largely following a similar trajectory regardless of what place it is. The virus is largely on its way out in the UK which is lagging slightly behind other European countries. 

&gt;And of course there are countries such as Italy, Spain where number of infections were so large then no system could handle that. 

They weren‚Äôt, the healthcare systems were badly prepared and Italy got hit badly in certain particular regions. Outside of them hospitals were coping perfectly fine and parts of Italy saw fewer deaths than normal. 

&gt;Those countries needed and did much stricter lock-downs then rest of Europe. 

No they didn‚Äôt need to do stricter lockdowns than other countries, they did it because they panicked more. There is no evidence that lockingdown stricter makes it go quicker, if anything it suggests the other and infections kept on declining quite fast even after many restrictions have been removed. 

&gt;UK's lock-down reduced mobility only by ~70%, it was enough to reduce reproductive number below 1,

No it was already declining before lockdown and it is following a similar trend as Germany. The R number is also not that useful. It is an utterly imprecise estimate, that is doesn‚Äôt take in account certain variables and constantly fluctuates. Especially at the tail end of the epidemic when there are fewer cases. It is not really a good way of determining things. You should also look at that paper that I have linked because it shows clearly that infections have started to decline before the UK went into lockdown. 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02090.pdf

&gt;Keeping infections withing healthcare capacity is just side-effect.

No that was the primary goal of lockdown and given how Covid19 is not even that much of a threat. With the CDC suggesting an IFR of [0.26%] (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html) and the [Centre for Evidence based medicine putting it around 0.1%-0.41%] (https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/) and that is overwhelming the elderly with serious underlying health conditions. There needs to be a good justification to have such massive restrictions on civil liberties and businesses, in the first place. At the moment they are utterly unwarranted and should be ended. 

&gt;It shouldn't be primary goal of lock-down for any long-term strategy.

No, lockdowns shouldn‚Äôt be used anymore in my opinion and many countries are transitioning out of them. The damage is too great and I don‚Äôt think the justification is strong enough to warrant them. The sooner they end the better. 

&gt;Countries going for herd immunity will be isolated from rest of the world until there is vaccine. 

Wrong. Once herd immunity has been met, the virus struggles to spread and so dies off naturally. While things like lockdowns and social distancing just prolongs it. It also seems pretty likely that herd immunity is already been met in certain places, even if it doesn‚Äôt show up on antibody testing which could explain why it is dying down even when restrictions are lifted.

It is also the opposite. New Zealand is likely going to have to maintain its 2 week quarantine for some time as the population has little immunity to it. 

&gt;Most countries have chosen South Korean TTI strategy.

No they haven‚Äôt, they have chosen to live with it and accept some risk. It is just that they are easing off restrictions in a more controlled manner, rather than in one go.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/h07ne8/uk_economy_likely_to_suffer_worst_covid19_damage/ftlbn51/,Auckland345,1591801649

1109,"The fall of Edward Colston‚Äôs statue in Bristol on Sunday has quickly become the defining image of the recent wave of Black Lives Matter protests across Britain. These protests were initially prompted by the killing of George Floyd in the US and systemic racism everywhere, but they may finally force us into a thorough examination of the British empire and its role in slavery.

Born in Bristol in 1636, Colston was the preeminent slave trader of his day, and during the time of his involvement with the Royal African Company ‚Äì between 1680 to 1692 ‚Äì it is estimated that the company transported some 84,000 Africans to the Caribbean and the Americas, of whom 19,000 died on the way.

In the decades that followed Colston‚Äôs death in 1721, another slave merchant rose to notoriety in Bristol: Samuel Span. Span headed the influential Society of Merchant Venturers, which had once petitioned parliament to lift the monopoly granted to the Royal African Company over the slave trade so that it could join it.

Span resonates on a personal level, because not only did he own the Caribbean island to which my African forebears were brought to work as slaves, he himself was also my ancestor.

Those clamouring for change must also make demands on behalf of those ‚Äì in the Caribbean and beyond ‚Äì who have been hard-hit by men like Colston and Span. They must begin to speak of reparations.

In 1763, at the conclusion of the seven years‚Äô war, France ceded to Britain the islands of St Vincent and the Grenadines, which included tiny Union Island, where my family have lived for generations. Span, then a naval chief, was rewarded with the island, giving him absolute control over its slaves. He set about transporting more Africans on Bristol-crewed vessels to work on the island‚Äôs cotton plantations. The island‚Äôs slave population reached a peak of 635 in 1822. Span named the island‚Äôs two main settlements after places in Bristol: Clifton and Ashton. Today, my late grandmother‚Äôs home faces the sea in Ashton, Union Island.

When Span died in 1796, his vast fortune ‚Äì which includes Union Island, and ran into the millions of pounds in today‚Äôs money ‚Äì was left to his English children. Other descendants who worked to create the family‚Äôs wealth would not see a single penny.

In the early 2000s I moved to Clifton, Bristol, for my undergraduate degree at the University of Bristol, which was founded with money derived from the sale of tobacco produced on plantations in the American south that once held slaves.

That the university had failed to address the racism and elitism upon which it was founded seemed glaringly obvious. There were only a handful of black students. And over the three years I spent there, I did not see a single black academic. Last year the student union called on the university to commission an independent review into ‚Äúinstitutionalised racism‚Äù after a slew of incidents.

Racism still appears to loom large in Bristol‚Äôs recent history, too. It is worth remembering that the city‚Äôs African-Caribbean community, inspired by Rosa Parks‚Äôs refusal to give up her seat on a bus in Alabama, led a boycott of the local bus service in 1963, protesting against widespread racial discrimination in employment and housing.

The boycott is considered to have been an influence on the passing of the landmark Race Relations Acts of 1965 and 1968, which outlawed racial discrimination in employment and housing ‚Äì a reminder that direct action has brought about change. Failure to tackle poor housing and the over-policing of black communities were among the factors that led to riots in April 1980 in St Paul‚Äôs, an inner-city neighbourhood with historic importance for the African-Caribbean community (now the area is undergoing rapid gentrification). 

Today, Colston‚Äôs toppling and subsequent drowning in the waters of Bristol‚Äôs harbour, where his slave ships once docked, should force the city ‚Äì and the country as a whole ‚Äì into a wider reckoning about racism and empire.

In fact, the process has already begun: last year the University of Bristol appointed Olivette Otele as professor of the history of slavery, with a mandate to investigate the institution‚Äôs and the city‚Äôs links to the trade.

But what about Union Island?

Unionites continued to live in poverty long after slaves were freed in 1838. The island had to wait until the mid-1970s to gain access to electricity, just before St Vincent and the Grenadines won its independence from Britain. Labelled the Tahiti of the Caribbean, because of its lush volcanic silhouette set in sparkling coral-laden seas, Union attracts an international cast of wealthy jetsetters ‚Äì even though its 3,000 or so permanent residents find themselves grinding through a third year of recession. Unemployment and poverty are rife. 

Statues in tribute to the likes of Colston and Span in British cities rightly seem abhorrent to many. But the material damage they wrought was felt far beyond these shores ‚Äì it is high time that the damage is fully accounted for.

We in the UK need to begin a national debate on reparations for slavery, a crime which heralded the age of capitalism and provided the basis for racism that continues to endanger black life globally. It will follow a landmark US Congress hearing on the topic last year.

Protesters making demands of British institutions and examining the individuals who profited from slavery, must also follow the money trail to places such as Union Island. Our vision for change must be global because Britain, after all, was a vast empire.",,/r/europe/comments/h0aifm/its_time_for_britain_to_think_seriously_about/ftky68k/,bataneyelid,1591794294

&gt; International law was constructed by, and approved by, a lot of dictatorships including SA and the SU. If you want citation for that, I can provide them.

Alright, credible source that international law was ""constructed"" by South Africa and the Soviet Union.

If you mean they signed treaties, you don't have a case, and you're moving the goal posts already, for that matter.

&gt; You just have to look at what international law does in effect. It is completely toothless to prevent its breaking in inter-state conflicts (f.ex. Saddam had basically no repercussions for gassing the Kurds)

International law is a framework designed to test the legality of actions of states, it isn't carte blanche to simply subjugate a sovereign country to international rule: however, an international coalition of nations could, and have, intervene based on such violations. 

A failure to invade a country doesn't nullify international law, nor does whining about the lack of ferocity of e.g. economic and political  sanctions.

&gt; I mean, are you afraid Americans will wade in and depose the dutch PM?

Well, not immediately that, but the Americans have repeatedly threatened the ICC and have adopted a law authorising an invasion of my country designed to interfere with its operation.

&gt; I like international rules existing. What I don't like is the rules and enforcement we currently have. There are no official enforcement mechanisms, no ""UN army"" if you will

See above.

&gt; I don't like dictators and tyrants hiding behind international law while gassing their own citizens

Gassing your own citizens is clearly a violation of international law.

1236,"I am not emotional, I am putting it in a wording that reflects what is going on here better than just technical back-and-forth about figures nobody can really fathom because they are larger than anyone ever deals with in real life.

The baseline of the EU, as worded in the No-bailout clause in the treaty is that everybody solves it's own budgetary problems. That is basically it. That is the baseline for every discussion to start. Now there is a crisis and a cry for help. Fine. But the baseline to start from is No Bailout. Or in financial terms, 1100 billion MFF. 

Agreeing to possibly 500bn, maybe even 750bn in loans, is a huge compromise for the countries who are asked to be effectively the guarantors for these loans. But that is dismissed out of hand by countries demanding things that have been categorically and resoundingly rejected by the Netherlands and others **for litterally decades.** So yes, I would equate that in terms of how far you would have to move with someone coming into your house and demanding to fuck your wife and daughter. The Treaties are the centerpoint, the very base upon which the EU is built. This 750bn plan is a direct attack on Art 125, the no bailout clause and by extent thus on the whole Treaty on which the EU is based.

Both sides have to forget the past turks hurt as much as greeks did and vice versa you can't change the multiculturedness in western turkey but you can embrace it.

I can't remember if it was actually proven true but he also most likely was involved in the assassinations of Lumumuba and Rwasagore. Even if he wasn't involved, it was well known he HATED Lumumbda for those speeches. He probably danced of the graves of the 2 African leaders.

It usually resulted in degradation and being sent to serve with fighting units at the front. German historian Sven Felix Kellerhoff argued that, instead of fear of punishment the participants were more afraid of peer pressure and the possibility of exclusion from their group.

1411,"  **It is planned that construction works project  on a storage facility system, that could accommodate equipment of a  full US Army armoured brigade, would be finalized in Powidz in two  years. Defence24.pl has obtained detailed information from US Army  Europe, on the current status of the project and the planned shape that  the base would take. We also received information as to what assets  would be stationed there.**¬†

&amp;#x200B;

*(Note: the project in Powidz has been in planning  since at least 2017 and it has been endorsed by NATO. It is not  directly tied to any of the recently reported plans to move parts of US  Forces from Germany to Poland and/or other NATO Member States as well as  CONUS)*

The information that we have obtained from the US Army Europe  suggests that equipment for an armoured brigade would be deployed in  Powidz. The primary equipment is to include:

&amp;#x200B;

* around 85 M1A2 Abrams MBTs;
* around 130 M2/M3 Bradley platforms;
* 18 M109A6/A7 Paladin Sphs, belonging to the self-propelled artillery  squadron. Equipment that would be used by support units would be  deployed to Powidz as well.¬†

**Work Progress**

The US Army Europe public affairs reps emphasized that the primary  contract concerning the construction works in Powidz was signed on 14th  November 2019, with a German-Polish consortium.¬†The implementation of  the agreement valued at the level of USD 183 million (EUR 166 million,  ca. 750 million Polish zlotys), would make it possible to create jobs in  the host country, Poland. The investment is financed with the use of  NATO funding (NSIP programme - eds.).¬† According to NATO Secretary  General Jens Stoltenberg, this project is the largest single  infrastructure project NATO has funded in 30 years.

The NATO funds have been divided into three parts, covering the  specific areas of work. The first one - tree cutting - has already been  executed. Site clearance has been going on since the year 2019. It is  now 80% complete.

Construction works are defined as stage 3. The decision on allocation  of funds for the construction works has been made recently (in April).  The process is scheduled to begin in the summer and it is expected that  it would last until the summer of 2022.

US Army Europe has not identified any pandemic-related problems, everything is progressing in line with the original plan.¬†

**What infrastructure is expected to be established in Powidz?**

According to US Army Europe, the Powidz base is to include, among other facilities:

&amp;#x200B;

* An 8,600 square meter workshop with 20 repair bays capable to  support M1A2 tanks and two 30-ton overhead cranes capable of depot-level  repairs including all administrative space for equipment accountability  and issuance.
* 5 humidity-controlled warehouses with combined area of 60,000 square meters
* 2 garages for light repair with total area of 1,650 square meters

The information that had been released before also mentions the following facilities:

&amp;#x200B;

* Vehicle-washing and brake testing station facility, with an area of 1,350 square meters;
* Administrative facility;
* Operational storage facility, 5,570 square meters;
* Vehicle Assembly Point Pavement, 22,550 square meters;
* Safety and information systems - CCTV, audio/video systems, operator‚Äôs console;
* Oil, fuels and lubricants and dangerous goods storage facility;
* Self-propelled crane.

**APS System: Meaning**

Establishment of a strategic system of storage facilities in the  potential areas of operations makes it possible, should crisis  circumstances emerge, to deploy troops alone, without the equipment, to  the troubled region of choice. This, essentially, shortens the time and  cost of reaction and deployment. The deployments may be carried out  without using the heavy airlift capability. Chartered airliners (or  military aircraft carrying passengers alone) could be employed instead.

The decision on the establishment of APS (Army Prepositioned Stock)  in Europe has been made in 2016. The equipment also started to be stored  at the relevant storage facilities in 2016. Earlier on it had been  assumed that scattered and limited European Activity Set would be used  for deployment purposes. The main objective adopted here was to organize  exercises. Initially, the equipment was being stored at the existing  facilities in Belgium, Germany, or the Netherlands. However, the  narrative suggesting that an equipment base for an American armored  brigade in Poland, in Powidz, has become visible since 2017. Whereas  this required, for obvious reasons, much higher investment than in  Western Europe.

The investment approved in 2019 by Jens Stoltenberg and discussed  here is a good example of cooperation between the US and other NATO  member states. On one hand, the APS would be financed with the use of  allied funding. On the other, the Americans would deliver modernized  assets that are to be stored in Powidz. Should a threat emerge in the  region, soldiers could be sent to Powidz to man the equipment rapidly.

&amp;#x200B;

The following assets have already been deployed to Europe, within the Army Prepositioned Stock system:

&amp;#x200B;

* Equipment for a single armoured brigade (set that is analogous or close to the one that would be stored at the Polish APS)
* Division command equipment
* Equipment for Artillery Brigade elements (M109, M270 MLRS, M142 HIMARS)
* Equipment for at least single VSHORAD battalion (Avenger)
* Equipment for support, logistics, engineering elements, and so on.

**The stored equipment, including the APS in Powidz, will offer an  option of forming an armored division.** Establishing a facility as such  is a major reinforcement of defence capabilities in Central-Eastern  Europe, as it would be possible to deploy another brigade in the area,  that would be placed along the element based here on a rotational basis.  No necessity would emerge to deploy equipment from Germany, not to  mention a Trans-Atlantic deployment.

**Support and Commitment**

The Poles would probably be obliged to ensure the security of those  facilities and to properly prepare them to host the troops. This means  that Poland would be tasked with assigning security personnel to the  base. In a situation in which direct threat is present, the local forces  would probably also be obliged to protect the APS from enemy aircraft.  However, some of the aforesaid capabilities could be provided by the  allied units. So far US Army Europe has no information on the potential  plans assuming that extra American air defence assets would be deployed  to Powidz.

Regular exercises related to deployment of US Forces to Poland would  also play a key meaning here, so that they could rapidly, a few days  from the decision to activate the APS, man the equipment and get ready  for operations. The completion of the construction works would be an  important step in the process of reinforcing the US and NATO presence in  Europe. However, keeping the whole APS (Army Prepositioned Stock) ready  would be a necessity, over the upcoming years.",,/r/europe/comments/h05pqx/us_army_to_preposition_heavy_armour_in_poland/ftk9m8i/,TyrantfromPoland,1591772819

The rest of the article explains why Croatia was granted a transitional period in the first place, and now an extension:

1635,"&gt;Unpopular fact, most of the atrocities committed were done by Congolese against Congolese. The officers were Europeans, the army was native.

The Congolese are not a homogenous people. There are over 200 ethnic groups in that region. The old colonial tactic of ""Divide and Conquer"" was firmly at play there and existing ethnic structures were codified and used in a way that could benefit Leopold and Belgium as much as possible. 

If you drive a nation into inter-ethnic slaughter by capitalizing on the greed of a portion of its population, your hands are still soaked in the blood of the resulting victims. Take the hand-over of Jews from Axis-affiliated states to Nazi Germany as an example.

What on earth makes you think the Korean War was lost? You know South Korea exists right? 

&gt; About Afghanistan, USA achieved nothing. Taliban aren't going to become a traditional politic party... Just like North Vietnam wasn't going to let South Vietnam alone when usa retreated...


There was never anything to learn about Afghanistan. The Afghanistan war started because the US wanted revenge on Bin Laden after 9/11. The Taliban refused to hand him over, so the US invaded. Once the Taliban, were defeated, the US had to help rebuild the country.

When the US invaded, the Taliban were defeated very quickly. That wasn‚Äôt because US troops were doing a lot of fighting, that was because the Northern Alliance and lots of Afghans took up arms against the Taliban. The Taliban are deeply unpopular in Afghanistan after their brutality from 1996-2001, and the Taliban are from the Pashtun ethnic group that makes up less than half of Afghanistan‚Äôs population.


The Taliban never conquered all of Afghanistan. Even before the US invaded, the Taliban had enemies in Northern Afghanistan. The reason why the Taliban seized power in 1996 was because they were basically formed as a proxy group of Pakistan. The Taliban know that can‚Äôt take over the country again because it‚Äôs a different country. Right now, almost all US troops have been pulled out of Afghanistan for years and the Taliban aren‚Äôt any closer to taking over the country.

What would your alternative have been? To invade Afghanistan and just then abandon the country once the Taliban were initially kicked out of power in 2001?

2181,"&gt; What exactly did you buy for high market value?

Pretty much everything you see here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_Land_Forces#Equipment

Aside from old Carl gustav grenade launchers (oldest variants) , small arms and very old Volvo and slightly newer Scania trucks (ironically gifted by not-NATO Sweden and a few by Norway). Overall that's like at best few million Euros worth of very stuff over 20 something years that were gifts, everything else was bought on market value 

&gt;Cause I see similar deals from UK, Austria and US surpluses for the Latvian army.

Latvia bought 123 CVRT vehicles from UK for 48 million Euros, and considering these are vehicles from 1970's that is by no means cheap or a gift, that is market value

From Austria M109 howitzers were kind of cheap, but again Austria is not-NATO state and our ministry just appears to have just found a good deal as Austrians were downsizing their national army.

What USA has given is : bunch of very old M14 rifles (yey, such help, weapons that were outdated even when they were introduced back in 1960's), some M16 rifles that were too few to be issued widely and are only in storage

And whole 3 Husky VMMD Route clearance vehicles, together with some financing help when Latvia bought Polaris baggies for its border guard. So essentialy, we are talking about symbolic stuff here at best (baggies, mine-clearers, 40 year old rifles). Even the HMMWV's Latvian army bought were bought mostly market value, only 10 cars were gifted for NATO missions and the rest 28 bought on market value. 

Same thing with Lithuania and Estonia. They have bought almost everything themselves, and all of their vehicles are bought on their own. When Estonia was looking for a new IFV, Americans did actually offer them Bradley like these Greeks are getting, but again for regular market price, not some donation (Estonians ended up buying cheaper used CV90's that needed repairs to get running from Norway instead because of it).",Latvia,/r/europe/comments/gyc7jr/greek_army_to_receive_350_bradley_m2a2_ifvs_and/ftht8ah/,angryteabag,1591722761

&gt;Nazism is a form of fascism,[2][3][4][5] with disdain for liberal democracy and the parliamentary system. It incorporates fervent antisemitism, anti-communism, scientific racism, and the use of eugenics into its creed

Now what I'd call a Nazi is someone who has highly authoritarian half state run economy that promotes one race over all others. (Oddly Enough China fits this perfectly lol and even has eugenic in the plans)

And again Wikipedia says 

&gt;Fascism (/Ààf√¶ É…™z…ôm/) is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism[1][2] characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, as well as strong regimentation of society and of the economy[3] which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.

France is more involved globally than Germany in armed conflicts. You couldn't even generally say 'military' because Germany is selling more military grade goods than France. I simply don't see any other general areas where France is more engaged than Germany.  
I'm not writing this because I think Germany is 'better' or so. I couldn't care less actually about nationalist/patiotic sentiments. It's the info I have. The 'changing of the economic gap' you're speaking about would require a re-strucurizing of the EU or at least some massive, game-changing new treaties, which I cannot predict or see coming. Also Germans would need to end the loan-dumping they started (at least) 20 years ago.

Their homicide rate is over 5x the US (US: 5.0 Mexico: 29.0)

Western Europe has an exceptionally low homicide rate. The reasons are not certain, but it is a fascinating field of study. The US homicide rate is well below the world average, but has always been higher than Western Europe. While I doubt the US will ever see that low a rate, I am comforted by the steady reduction. We are currently at about a 100 year low (which probably means all-time low, as records were not great.)

&gt;In the long term, violent crime in the United States has been in decline since colonial times. The homicide rate has been estimated to be over 30 per 100,000 people in 1700, dropping to under 20 by 1800, and to under 10 by 1900.

2439,"&gt;In fact, putting them out of said job or career could drive them towards accepting more welfare and state intervention. There may even be an element of jealousy involved.

Son, what are you drinking and can I have some? Why would I, a leftist, push myself out of a job I like in order to get ''more welfare''? The only parts of ''pushing people out of jobs'' has been in relation to e.g. nearly slave labour work that is never properly compensated or whose process is so heartless and horrible that no one deserves to work there. Have you worked in call centers? They're breeding places of emotional trauma and alcoholism - due to management and the work itself. 

&gt; They do care about petty criminals. 

Yes, because these people can be helped, treated and then helped to lead fulfilling, productive and happy lives without crime and in a way that supports their communities. Treating criminality is *very* important, especially for poor communities. 

&gt; but because of a self-perpetuating ""hood"" culture that glorifies crime and steers people away from the conventional ways to attain success in ""white"" society.

Oh so you do believe the state should be involved in people's sex lives? Because it's even less work to not check what sex people have. 

&gt;But the slippery slope argument is real. Left wing activists are never satisfied with the situation. The longer this situation goes on, and the more of their demands are met, the bigger are their further demands, and once they dillute one established institution, they start to destroy another. Looking at stuff that happened in most western countries during the last 2 decades serves as the best confirmation of the validity of the slippery slope principle.

Hahaha and you think the rest of the political spectrum is just content with sitting on their thumbs? That's a very childish view on how politics works. 

If you'll check european governments the last few decades, you will find decidedly (center) right governments. That's the reality you guys ignore, all the supposed decline in institutions has all happened under rightwing governments.

For years, Germany held these truths to be self-evident: no big budget deficits, no common European debt issuance and no European fiscal union.

In the last few weeks, those principles have been revised with an alacrity that has stunned Germany‚Äôs neighbours. A country that was long ultra-cautious on Europe and wedded to balanced budgets seems to have had a Damascene conversion.

The immediate trigger for the change is the coronavirus pandemic, which is expected to plunge the EU into the steepest slump in its history. Yet the change is nowhere near as sudden as it looks. It is now clear that the new thinking on Europe has been brewing for at least two years now. And the incubator was an institution that long symbolised Germany‚Äôs fiscally hawkish view on Europe ‚Äî the finance ministry.

Few better epitomise the shift than J√∂rg Kukies. A former Goldman Sachs banker who has served as deputy finance minister for the last two years, he was one of the drivers of last month‚Äôs Franco-German proposal to raise ‚Ç¨500bn through common EU debt and hand it out as grants, not loans, to corona-hit countries.

For Mr Kukies, the fund is a key milestone on the road to a full European fiscal union ‚Äî to an EU with the powers not only to issue bonds but also raise its own revenues. ‚ÄúWe talk a lot about European sovereignty, but you can‚Äôt expect [that] to evolve as long as fiscal union remains incomplete,‚Äù he said in an interview with the Financial Times.

Mr Kukies embodies the new spirit at the finance ministry. Between 2009 and 2017, it was presided over by Wolfgang Sch√§uble, who came to embody the austerity policies imposed on countries like Greece during Europe‚Äôs sovereign debt crisis.

His successor Olaf Scholz, the former mayor of Hamburg, at first seemed at pains to project continuity, insisting he was just as wedded to balanced budgets ‚Äî the policy of schwarze Null or black zero ‚Äî as Mr Sch√§uble was.

However, behind the scenes he was reshaping the ideological mindset of the ministry. In January 2019 he replaced Ludger Schuknecht, its hawkish chief economist, with Jakob von Weizs√§cker, a Social Democrat who had been a member of the European Parliament for 5 years and in 2011 drafted a proposal for so-called blue eurobonds.



Mr Kukies, who like Mr von Weizs√§cker studied in Paris, was also a key appointment. ‚ÄúOn the day Olaf was sworn in, we were scheduled to speak for 30 minutes and it turned into a two-hour discussion about Europe,‚Äù he said, recalling his job interview in 2018. ‚ÄúWe talked about the inherent contradiction of having an almost completed monetary union and a fiscal union that is rather weak.‚Äù

Mr Kukies, who was at the time co-head of Germany for Goldman Sachs, says it was this mind-meld on closer European integration that persuaded him to enter public service. ‚ÄúScholz made it clear to me that he fully stands behind this idea ‚Äî and that he has a real plan to move things forward on the European level,‚Äù he said.

According to Mr Kukies, he and Mr Scholz have been pushing German policy in a more pro-European direction ever since. First there was the 2018 Meseberg Agreement between France and Germany which gave fresh impetus to European banking reform and capital markets union ‚Äî the plan to encourage greater cross-border private investment in the bloc. The two neighbours also backed a joint push to reform the ESM, the eurozone‚Äôs bailout fund.

Then there was Mr Scholz‚Äôs surprise announcement last November that Germany was ready to drop its once cast-iron opposition to a common deposit insurance scheme, a potentially big step on the road to eurozone banking union.

But it was the coronavirus crisis that really changed Germany‚Äôs fiscal and European policies in fundamental ways. As the pandemic took hold, Mr Scholz quickly abandoned the schwarze Null, pushing through ‚Ç¨150bn of new borrowing. Last month he went further, unveiling a ‚Ç¨130bn fiscal stimulus whose centrepiece was an unprecedented cut in value added tax.¬†

On the European level, Mr Scholz helped enact a ‚Ç¨500bn package of eurozone emergency measures, and worked with his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire on the Franco-German proposal for the recovery fund.

Mr Kukies‚Äôs transition to Berlin from Frankfurt, where his wife and daughter have remained, was not easy. Many of Mr Scholz‚Äôs fellow Social Democrats did not look kindly on his hiring a banker from Goldman.

‚ÄúIn Germany, it‚Äôs not that common for people to move between the private and public sector,‚Äù Mr Kukies said.

Yet, in the meantime, he has gained in stature and risen to become one of the government‚Äôs most indispensable actors. From Berlin‚Äôs rescue plan for Lufthansa to the Economic Stabilisation Fund, the ‚Ç¨100bn vehicle to recapitalise and buy stakes in companies affected by coronavirus, all the finance ministry‚Äôs major initiatives cross his desk. He has also a key influence on Germany‚Äôs Europe policy.

The former banker is unabashed in his support for greater European fiscal integration. But there are caveats in his view. It can only work if every member state plays by the rules. ‚ÄúThe Stability and Growth Pact needs to be strengthened so that all member states create fiscal space in the good times,‚Äù he said. Fiscal union will not work when states have ‚Äúmaximum flexibility‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ. in the fiscal rules‚Äù.

Critics have played down the significance of the recovery fund he helped conceive. Though Mr Scholz has described it as Europe‚Äôs ‚ÄúHamiltonian moment‚Äù, it does not, unlike Alexander Hamilton‚Äôs 1790 deal in the US, mutualise outstanding debt. There are also no signs yet that significant tax-raising powers will be conferred on the EU.

But that does not detract from the importance of the recovery fund and what it represents, Mr Kukies said. ‚ÄúIt was a significant signal to Europe that we‚Äôre serious about the idea of solidarity.‚Äù",Half German half Austrian,/r/europe/comments/gzgnbj/the_minds_behind_germanys_shifting_fiscal_stance/ftgd9q5/,Ynwe,1591687170

As the pandemic took hold, Mr Scholz quickly abandoned the schwarze Null, pushing through ‚Ç¨150bn of new borrowing. Last month he went further, unveiling a ‚Ç¨130bn fiscal stimulus whose centrepiece was an unprecedented cut in value added tax. 

On the European level, Mr Scholz helped enact a ‚Ç¨500bn package of eurozone emergency measures, and worked with his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire on the Franco-German proposal for the recovery fund. 
Mr Kukies‚Äôs transition to Berlin from Frankfurt, where his wife and daughter have remained, was not easy. Many of Mr Scholz‚Äôs fellow Social Democrats did not look kindly on his hiring a banker from Goldman.

‚ÄúIn Germany, it‚Äôs not that common for people to move between the private and public sector,‚Äù Mr Kukies said.
Yet, in the meantime, he has gained in stature and risen to become one of the government‚Äôs most indispensable actors. From Berlin‚Äôs rescue plan for Lufthansa to the Economic Stabilisation Fund, the ‚Ç¨100bn vehicle to recapitalise and buy stakes in companies affected by coronavirus, all the finance ministry‚Äôs major initiatives cross his desk. He has also a key influence on Germany‚Äôs Europe policy.

The former banker is unabashed in his support for greater European fiscal integration. But there are caveats in his view. It can only work if every member state plays by the rules. ‚ÄúThe Stability and Growth Pact needs to be strengthened so that all member states create fiscal space in the good times,‚Äù he said. Fiscal union will not work when states have ‚Äúmaximum flexibility‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ. in the fiscal rules‚Äù.

Critics have played down the significance of the recovery fund he helped conceive. Though Mr Scholz has described it as Europe‚Äôs ‚ÄúHamiltonian moment‚Äù, it does not, unlike Alexander Hamilton‚Äôs 1790 deal in the US, mutualise outstanding debt. There are also no signs yet that significant tax-raising powers will be conferred on the EU. 
But that does not detract from the importance of the recovery fund and what it represents, Mr Kukies said. ‚ÄúIt was a significant signal to Europe that we‚Äôre serious about the idea of solidarity.‚Äù 

Then there was Mr Scholz‚Äôs surprise announcement last November that Germany was ready to drop its once cast-iron opposition to a common deposit insurance scheme, a potentially big step on the road to eurozone banking union.",Lake Bled connoisseur,/r/europe/comments/gzgnbj/the_minds_behind_germanys_shifting_fiscal_stance/ftg5fxq/,MelodicBerries,1591680422

GDP spend also doesn't equal goods received. 

Large portions of military spending are spent on veterans, benifits and salaries.
Large portions are spend of installations, upkeep and logistics. 

Germany and Spain are going to have disproportionately larger amounts of money spend on that compared to Poland. I'd wager the ratio is a good 1:3 as in for the same salary Poland can field 3 solders compared to 1 Germany or Spanish one.

The American defense budget for example is highly bloated by the fact that they need to do force projection. You need to man, staff, pay rent for all the bases around the world plus the huge carrier fleet. The US would have significantly more arms and weapons if it didn't do just this. One can't compare China/India/Russia to the US for that sole reason.

The US might spend 36% of all the military spending in the world but at least 2/3 of that is wasted because the US military is an incredibly expensive workforce that needs to do force projection. China is said to do 13% of all military expenditure. 

But when it comes to actual RnD while the US is technologically ahead of China by at least 10 years minimum they're probably both spending equal amounts of money on RnD as China doesn't actually need to force project yet and their soldiers cost a fraction of what US soldiers do.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/gz1yno/threat_proximity_largely_dictates_military/ftg646z/,SvijetOkoNas,1591680958

California legalized de facto recreational marijuana a quarter of a century ago with their extensive symptom list that included nightmares. Oakland was fully legal 20 years ago.

New York, Montana, and Utah all have similar medical programs albeit relatively strict with the most lenient symptom being diagnosed ptsd

Nevada legalized recreational marijuana in 2017 and along with state laws about gambling and prostitution, residents are given arguably more freedom than anywhere in the world.

Alabama marijuana laws decree that getting caught with any amount of cannabis can land you in jail for up to 20 years with a felony offense.

2941,"I'll do it in reverse order:

As far as SpaceX goes, I think you're completely on point and overall, our views on this seem to be in alignment. I've recently discussed the issue [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/gyyoxi/european_space_agency_is_aiming_for_its_own/ftddfp5/?context=3), if you want to have a look for yourself. 

Generally speaking, competition shouldn't be feared and kept away, but appreciated and encouraged. Full stop; nothing more to say, really. 

Or to step away from the minefield and take another example: Harley Davidson is still around because BMW and Honda entered the US motorcycle market and forced it to be better. In the 1970s, Harleys were pretty much legacy, living off their famous history whilst leaking badly and being overpriced. Competition changed that, which was good for the customers, the shareholders, the employees and the treasury. 

But I think you misjudge both Boeing's and Airbus' real functions. 

Airbus is more than just a corporation producing planes or choppers or what have you. Their real purpose is to share a common industrial base in Europe among participating nations; that's why the German, the French, the Spanish and to a lesser extent the Italian government all have their seats at the table. They want to make sure that the production sites are spread all over the place, which is *political*, not a business decision. 

As for Boeing, it's America's largest exporter. There's no way on earth the federal government will allow it to go under, because it's too important to fail or even lose too much market share to Airbus.

3082,"If they didn‚Äôt have some influence over the corporation then I think these governments would have sold off their stakes by now. They clearly at least look like they‚Äôre retaining some influence for some purpose.

If you look at the ownership structure of the European aerospace industry it looks driven by an interweb of national champions that have close relations with governments. It‚Äôs clearly, suspicious. Like Boeing, for example, isn‚Äôt owned at all by the US government, and isn‚Äôt even the largest US defense contractor, while Airbus is by far the largest French and German defense contractor. 

The entire EU argument in this trade dispute is that Boeing is just as bad because it gets special contracts with the US military. Not only are defense contracts outside the scope of the GATT agreement, but the US defense industry is way more competitive than the European defense industry and Boeing isn‚Äôt a national champion like Airbus is. If the US were giving special defense contracts to Boeing then Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman would all be suing the US government and complaining about unfair competition from Boeing.

For example, there is a partnership called ULA which launched US satellites. ULA was a partnership between Boeing and Lockheed and overcharged the US government a ton because they were the sole US launch provider. The only reason that SpaceX came in and the US government gave all its business to Elon Musk was because SpaceX was way fucking cheaper and the government went with the cheaper contractor. Boeing isn‚Äôt a national champion getting state support because otherwise the US government wouldn‚Äôt have switched the fat launch contracts to a random new SpaceX company founded by a guy not even born in the US.",,/r/europe/comments/gz542p/airbus_ceo_eu_should_adopt_cash_for_clunkers/ftf5xl0/,JSanchez504,1591658478

Woah, ok, so, from the back of my head:

1. It‚Äôs three weeks to the presidential election* (more on that later) and things are getting steamy. Current president is loosing the momentum (a few weeks ago the polls had him at around 50%, now it‚Äôs around 40 and falling down) and the candidate of the biggest opposing party is growing in the polls. Due to the president being pro-gov, the government is not happy at all.

2. COVID isn‚Äôt solved here at all, there were a few daily records lately (around 600 sick per day) and in spite of that we had most of the covid-regulations loosened and the official national
government propaganda is that everything is going good and we‚Äôve got it ( covid ) covered better than any country in Europe.

3. There are rumors that due to point 1 and using point 2 the government will want to implement a procedure called something in the terms of a state of a natural disaster and thus have the possibility to move the election date (still, only rumors)

4. In the meantime our national tv and a lot of pro-gov newspapers started their campaign of trying to destroy the oppositions‚Äô candidate ( Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski ) by any means necessary, and hey, the boys and girls there are linking him to whatever negative thing they can think of - mostly lies.

What strategy do we actually share though? We do share values on democracy and human rights, climate change and international trade, and these are certainly issues we should pursue together, but we are not culturally close in any real sense. Also note that outside of Taiwan (and Taiwan only due to its claiming of the 9-dash-line) none of these countries are actually in SEA. SEA as a whole is far from being a coherent bloc to deal with, and there is far less appreciation for human rights and democracy in the region.

&gt; I disagree. The fact that China is the second largest economy but still doesn't respect the intellectual property of European companies and doesn't even closely give them the same protection and economic freedom to them as Chinese companies enjoy in Europe will eventually end up in a similar conflict as the trade war with the US.

Our companies are still very happy to engage them. This was also an accusation leveled against Germany and the US in the 19th century, Japan in the 70s, Taiwan and South Korea in the 80s.

True, your comment was obscure to not say it is an organization.

You mean anarchists. That is what they are *by definition*. Why not call them what they are then? From the link you gave me:

3319,"&gt;The only country that has not signed UNCLOS i think is turkey and one more that dont really have islands/sea etc...thats quite telling.

There are around 7, including Israel and USA.

&gt;The map clearly ignores Crete's EEZ and part of Cyprus's.Not only that the turkish side of cyprus who is not recognized as a country internationally has EEZ. It dont really make sense.


This is why i said the map itself is unrealistic. And Cyprus's EEZ is a whole another subject. In order to determine it we need to solve the Cyprus's problem first. Shame Annan plan wasn't accepted. 

&gt;What is there to negotiate on that map? 

Everything, that's the point. I said the map itself is unrealistic. So is the Greek map, have you seen it? It is just as unrealistic. It basically cuts Turkey off from the Eastern Mediterrenean. 

&gt;Greece and Cyprus are EU members,if the drilling go on EU would have no choice but to react. 

React on what scale? Just trying to make Turkey accept Greece's EEZ map will never work. Reacting with sanctions without negotiations would be a poor move that would save the day but not solve the problem and would create even more problems in the long run. 

&gt;Also judging by Turkey's goverment and policy last few years,if you give in and try to negotiate with Erdogan would just have him come back few years down the line and ask for more....

I hate Erdogan as much as the next guy, but i don't know what negotiation you are talking about here. I don't remember Erdogan unilaterally breaking treaties he signed. Even if he had done that, it wouldn't justify refusing negotiations.

&gt;Military wise,if Turkey attacks its instantly over for them,and there's no way Greece would make the first move...From both sides they know war is something both sides dont want.

Both are part of the NATO and neither will attack unless attacked first. This is something we both agree on.

3326,"Actually there‚Äôs a decent amount of scholarship to suggest that much of early Viking activity in England and West Europe may have been religiously motivated. The Frankish Empire under Charlemagne saw the destruction of Irminsul, a significant location and shrine of Germanic paganism. The subsequent migration of Saxons and other pagans from the region into north Germany and Scandinavia likely brought with it a very anti-Christian vibe. This is why there is such vigor is the complete destruction and massacre of Christian populations seen in such cases as Lindisfarne. It is a backlash to the rapid push of Christianity towards Northern Europe.

There was no real resistance to be found at that monastery. Even if the population did have arms, they had only about an hour from the time they saw the masts of longships over the horizon until the Vikings made landfall. From a pragmatic standpoint, there was no reason to massacre a bunch of potential slaves. But they did anyways.

Many early actions such as that of Lindisfarne, the various raids on Iona, the sack of the bishopric at Hamburg, and the invasion of The Great Heathen Army all have very distinct religious character about them. And we see a decline in this behavior as the Viking Age progresses and religion becomes more a matter of political expedience for the pagans. Baptism brought peace deals and land gifts.

3330,"&gt; The question is what reform? There are plenty of reforms that could be enacting (like finally ending the class division of German schools, which coincidentally also disproportionality affect minority groups.) but they are not being proposed or discussed, it is just ""fuck racism"".

Are there any actual substantial statistics or studies, that prove your point? The prussian model created the Mittelstand, which is the backbone of our rock-solid economy. From my personal perspective and how successful it is/was, it just seems like such a bad idea to ""end"" it. Reforms sure, but completely removing it would be absolutely stupid. 

I myself was from a lower class and was able to attend Gymnasium. I also wouldn't consider my class mates were part of the high class. Most of them were low to middle class. Hell, we even had eastern european immigrants in my grade who spoke broken german. 

Sure, there is a division in classes, but it's nowhere near where this argument would make sense. If you raise your child as someone who you want to see succeed and your child shows the interest of wanting to achieve something, then you 100% be able to attend high school. Simple as that.

3335,"&gt;For how long ? Any limit ?

Help developing countries reach acceptable levels of living standards and the possibility to develop further on their own. Also give back stolen cultural artifacts, at least if the current political/cultural situation in the respective country allows it.

&gt;What do you mean ?

Many western companies employ cheap labour in developing countries and flood the markets with their mass-produced goods. That way, not enough people work in domestic organisations and those also can't compete, since they lack the economies of scale advantage. A certain level of protectionism that limits imports and exports would let a developing country establish their own economy instead of remaining dependent on the west. That also applies to aid shipments in a way. If people could get free or cheap grain from those, the local farming industry will never grow. Of course, when local farming doesn't exist or isn't possible, aid shipments and imports are still necessary.

I know this will be unpopular, but one of the best examples of fast economic growth was the early Soviet Union. Yes, it was undemocratic and Stalin was a piece of shit, but to get from a technologically backwards rural feudal society to sending the first man into space in less than 50 years is an achievement that we can and should learn from. That doesn't mean copy, we don't want to forget the human cost of that development, but there certainly are good lessons to be learned there.

Yes it¬¥s what he said to FDR maybe it was something he actually believed who knows. But it is also clear that he could have send wheat to Bengal. The Admiral of South-East-Asia also repeatedly asked for food shipments and was denied until August 43. You know the person who likely was the biggest expert on the feasibility of shipping food to Bengal at the time. it clearly wasn¬¥t impossible. Churchill just didn¬¥t want to. And I do actually believe he did it to not loose transports. I also believe his willingness to make this decision was fueled by his view of Indians as lesser humans which he repeatedly expressed during the famine.

I understand your impression that he's basically a masochist, but I don't share it.

Nice strawman. I never talked about ""a grand conspiracy"". It's just the bias of this companies and the narratives they push.  It's all out in the open. Certain things are labeled hateful and removed. 

&gt;  I work with some of the larger tech companies and their ranks are filled with conservatives at a pretty high level. 

So do I. Those people tend to not be very vocal outside certain circles about PC stuff or they'll get called harassers.  Don't dare discuss some of the most extreme things done in the name of diversity in a critical light or it's going to be a problem.

&gt; It helps the Republican party to make it seem like they're the underdog pushing back against an oppressor, so they've invented one, but it isn't tied to reality.

Lol. Nice that you bring Alex Jones. He was removed in a very orchestrated manner by practically all important tech outlets. It was a nice canary for freedom of speech.

Milo was removed because Twitter is woke and the shitty Ghostbusters movie was a symbol of feminism and you can't mock that so we'll make up something about how ""he incites harassment.

3486,"&gt;But other plants are more expensive even if they run at optimal capacity, and it only gets worse if they run less frequently.

Well renewables will be much more expensive per kWh too, that the reason why the capacity mechanism is needed. High fixed cost, low variable cost sources need this mechanism the most as they suffer the most from electricity prices collapsing due to our system being based on variable costs. In the current market system there's no future for high capital cost, low variable cost generators like wind, solar, hydro, nuclear... Hence the need to move away from the current market system.

&gt;This is really not different from other seasonal economic sectors, like for example tourism that also has infrastructure that goes unused during half the year. They'll just make their profit during the high storage phase of the year.

Which quite frankly has never been sustainable either, the tourism sectors has historically needed a lot of subsidies in order to make that happen. Furthermore the fixed costs of industry are higher than those of the tourism sector which can count on seasonal workers for example. Which doesn't need heating, cleaning etc in the off season, which doesn't face substantial startup and shutdown costs etc.

&gt;We already have arrived at the point of people paying others to take electricity off their hands, the logical next step seems to be to make a product with it, to sell later when the supply and demand is reversed. The conditions seem to be favourable.

Honestly, conditions have become less and less attractive for that. In the past prices were far more easy to predict and the fluctuations were higher. Very cheap power during nighttime, very expensive power during daytime.

These days prices are far less predictable and also far lower, making operations that count on price fluctuations to be profitable far less interesting. We've had this with our pumped storage plant in Coo for example, a completely written off, very cheap to run plant that we have considered closing due to a loss in profitability. We basically earn nothing on that plant anymore on the regular merchant electricity market. Its profitability completely depends on balancing services.

In short the current market system isn't sustainable, we have to move away from it. The capacity market is the most interesting system for high fixed cost, low variable cost generators which we politically want. Hence its the solution that's being pushed from both the industry and politicians. Is it ideal? Certainly not.

The attack on Lindesfarne was brought about by several different factors: increased population in the Viking world, trade routes with the Byzantine empire who wanted Europeans as slave labor, and inner-warring with the chieftains of Scandinavia who were jockeying for power. When the Vikings first arrived, The harbor master actually went down to greet them at lindesfarne, thinking they had just landed in the wrong spot.

3701,"These graphs are always a bit misleading, just like the ones about amount of hours worked per week. So, the context:

&gt;The duration of working life indicator is produced at the request of the Employment Committee indicators group, under the EU 2020 strategy. It uses life expectancy tables and activity rates as input for the calculation. The methodology was developed at the Ministry of Labour of Finland, in a paper by Helka Hytti and Ilkka Nio.  
&gt;  
&gt;**A common misunderstanding in the public debate on this indicator is that it shows how long persons must or should work. This is not the case.** The indicator is purely descriptive and shows what is happening, not what should be happening.  
&gt;  
&gt;As it is an average computed over all adults in the country, **the indicator is heavily influenced by the number of persons outside the labour force in a country.** In other words, it does not make any claims about how many years the persons who are in employment, work. It rather shows the combined effect of:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- what proportion of the adult population is in the labour force (being employed or unemployed) in each year of their life,  
&gt;  
&gt;\- and the life expectancy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most of the duration of working life can be explained by the participation rate. An illustration for the male and female population (total population), comparing their working life with the participation rate in each country, is presented in figure 4

The issue is the participation rate in the labor market. This is lower in countries like Italy. That leads to a lower average working life. The reasons for a lower participation rate can be a lot of things. Participation rate however is not influenced by unemployment directly, since unemployed people are still counted as participating in the labor market. It's probably more a reflection of more traditional family roles, where the man might work and the partner stays at home to take care of the kids. Or maybe influenced by the unregistered labor market, which is larger in Southern Europe.",,/r/europe/comments/gyrs05/duration_of_working_life_on_the_rise_in_the_eu/ftcq1cf/,cissoniuss,1591607054

This means Churchill is guilty of the same crime that Adolf Hitler ‚Äì his enemy in the second world war ‚Äì is: genocide. The official figure for those killed in the Holocaust from 1933 to 1945 is 12 million. Churchill presided over the deaths of at least 3 million in 1943. If such horrific crimes can be compared, the incidence of Churchill‚Äôs mass murder is far higher than Hitler‚Äôs.

3789,"&gt; Trump has been saying for 4 years that unless European countries met their NATO obligations, that he would remove American troops from NATO countries. What did you expect? 

First; the 2% norm was never an ""obligation"", and is a useless metric to begin with.

Two; the agreement in place is for that target to be hit by 2024. So there is absolutely no justification for taking such action based on this criteria *today*.

Second; Germany has in fact increased its military expenditure more than any other NATO member in recent years; so clearly they are working on it.

Third; a US official in fact claimed the move was because there's less of a need **because** of increased European NATO spending. So damned if they do, damned if they don't? 

Fourth; Nobody actually believes that Trump's involvement has anything other than to do with him feeling snubbed by Merkel over the G7.

Fifth: If this was a legit move; then why the fuck did nobody bother to pick up the phone?

&gt; Besides, according to this sub the EU has been responsible for all the peace in Europe over the last 75 years

It has.

&gt; so why does anyone care?

Because

1) you can't just make these kinds of unilateral moves without consulting the people/countries involved.

2) even if Europe can stand on its own militarily, that doesn't mean that having US forces here doesn't *help*. Ever hear of Force Multiplication?

3) The presence of a permanent military base provides a boost to the local economy. Suddenly withdrawing large numbers of troops from said base has a negative impact.",Flevoland (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/gyuh8n/us_decision_to_withdraw_troops_from_germany/ftcqs7j/,nybbleth,1591607837

3793,"&gt;Your arguments make sense, and then you go into full denial mode the moment Trump-Putin relationships are brought up.

That might be because of the last 5 years of non stop ""Trump Russia collusion"" with basically no evidence of this.

&gt;Read what you said 'I always expect someone to have their own intrest at heart'. And the moment the question goes back to Trump, that is no longer an issue because 'your issues are aligned'.

They are aligned in the sense that the US sees Russia as a potential threat and act accordingly (for example soldiers in neighboring countries), not only as a strategic partner. 

&gt;Meanwhile the good ol' US is ramping up investments in Russia as well right under your nose:

I wouldnt call it ramping up when it hasnt even reached the level from over a decade ago. But yes, INVESTORS from the US  (note that doesnt equal the US government) are investing a lot of money in Russia. That doesnt change the fact that Russia is considered dangerous by the US.

&gt;The one who slowed that down was Obama, but somehow you believe Trump did more for Poland then anybody else.  
&gt;  
&gt;Are there more or less troops/equipment in Poland under Trump? Obama made promises like with the anti-missile shield, but he didnt deliver.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you want Russia on a chain Trump is literally the worst bet for you, but he lulls you to sleep by sending a few troops. He doesn't have Polands intrest at heart. Politically Russia means more to them then you do.

Seriously, how many times do I have to say it. I never claimed US has Polands interests at heart, they obviously dont. We just happen to have similar viepoint that Russia is a potential threat.

&gt; Politically Russia means more to them then you do.

Politically and economically Russia means more to Germany then Poland does.

&gt;So again, Germany bad, US good right? It seems like you don't care about what is happening, as long as it is the US is the good guy.

You keep putting words in my mouth, please stop. The only real bad guy I consider here is Russia, because of their bad actions. The difference between US and WE is that the US sees Russia as bad/dangerous, WE sees Russia as a strategic partner. CEE sees Russia as dangerous, so who are we more aligned with?

Some people believe Poland cannot fight off everyone so we should ally with the US.

Others believe Poland cannot fight off everyone so we should root for transforming EU into a ""super power with its own army"".

Other would say it's a bad idea to have ANY foreign soldiers on our soil.

The main reason people believe we need to ally with the US and UK - Russia and Germany were collaborating against Poland since-for-ever and many people see Germany as being more friendly with Russia than Poland. And as much as it may sound like nonsense as Poland is part of the EU and NATO - there are some events which fuel such opinions.

Personally I don't believe in alliances with countries we don't share a border with. We were allied with France and the United Kingdom during WWII and we were ""sort of allied"" with France under the rule of Napoleon - all of that did not work well.

My (Norwegian) father told me that he hated learning English in school and much preferred German because the English teacher was a real stickler for speaking ‚ÄúThe Propuhh Oxfuhhd English‚Äù as he put it (he really exaggerates the lack of rhoticity there) and would take off big points if they slipped up or let any Americanisms intrude, even on the inflection of their voice. He had to have hyper focus on saying not just the right thing but in just the right way of the Queen‚Äôs English.

When he first came to the South in the US he found that most people he interacted with were fine with him drawling and speaking lazily. Then he got much more practice without having to maintain hyper-focus and feeling that his English was something terrible he couldn‚Äôt use. Now his German is gone but his English is at the point where people ask him what part of the South he‚Äôs from... your call on if that‚Äôs good or bad English.

And sadly people are so much better at building hells than heavens. And this new generation has proven they are very easily provoked into a mob like witch hunting behaviour full of hate and bigotry, (while paradoxically screaming they are against hate and bigotry.) that its not looking bright.

4083,"&gt; I love the irony that you‚Äôre oblivious to the fact you‚Äôre claiming people are ignorant for claiming they know there is a God, but you are enlightened for claiming to know there is not.

I never claimed there wasn't. I claimed there was zero evidence there was.

If I tell you there are unicorns in the center of the sun, would you believe me? Or would you require some form of proof for that statement?

&gt;You might want to look into being an agnostic.

I have, and I found that the amount of evidence pointing towards a deity is exactly zero.

There might be one though. There could be some completely hands off deity that's watching us, or we could all be some sort of forgotten experiment - there are countless theories. However we have zero evidence of any such thing, therefore believing in any of them would be an absolute waste of time.

&gt;Though clearly your atheism isn‚Äôt through any kind of actual belief of anything, you just hate yourself and want to troll people.

No, I have a great life. I employ over 40 people, have experienced more of the world than 99.99% of people, eaten the best food out there, have plenty of wonderful friends, read many books by fantastic authors, and generally just enjoy life.

That doesn't mean that I don't get to ridicule people for their silly belief ... when they have had ample opportunity to educate themselves properly.

I completely understand the poor sheep herder being Muslim or Christian. He never received the tools to develop critical thinking.

But the top 75% of Americans, especially from a state like Massachusetts? That's just willful ignorance and means you probably lack a lot of development for a person with the tools they were given.

Anyway, you seem to have made up your mind that I'm a troll. Reality is that I'm not, I simply enjoy seeing the advances we have made since we left god behind and started looking at scientific methods to rely on our development.

50,000 years of deities vs a few 100 of science - look at the difference. And we're still in a place where the vast majority of us believe in fairy tales and myths.

You believe in Jesus, or Muhammed, or whatever ... others in Vishnu, and others still in Odin. It's all just as silly to me.",,/r/europe/comments/gvwhfc/homicide_rate_deaths_per_100000_inhabitants/ftc4x9p/,upvotesthenrages,1591589129

4170,"I recall reading that the photograph took a lot of the market for painters.

I mean, you can work at making the most-detailed and -realistic painting in the world, but a photograph is going to win *and* be vastly cheaper.

IIRC, it was Impressionism where paintings started to diverge from being realistic.

*googles*

Yeah, this wasn't the source I was thinking of, but Wikipedia talks about it:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism

&gt;The development of Impressionism can be considered partly as a reaction by artists to the challenge presented by photography, which seemed to devalue the artist's skill in reproducing reality. Both portrait and landscape paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in truth as photography ""produced lifelike images much more efficiently and reliably"".[31]
&gt;
&gt;In spite of this, photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression, and rather than compete with photography to emulate reality, artists focused ""on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph‚Äîby further developing into an art form its very subjectivity in the conception of the image, the very subjectivity that photography eliminated"".[31] The Impressionists sought to express their perceptions of nature, rather than create exact representations. This allowed artists to depict subjectively what they saw with their ""tacit imperatives of taste and conscience"".[32] Photography encouraged painters to exploit aspects of the painting medium, like colour, which photography then lacked: ""The Impressionists were the first to consciously offer a subjective alternative to the photograph"".[31]

Digging up a timeline of artistic movements in painting, it looks like the last movement prior to Impressionism was Realism:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)

&gt; Realism is the precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects. Realism in this sense is also called naturalism, mimesis or illusionism. Realistic art was created in many periods, and it is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/gyip9g/polish_army_fighting_against_invading_austrians/ftbqgcm/,duisThias,1591579812

True. One of the many horrid things about him. A very valid reason for Irish people to hate him.

But it absolutely wasn't seen as a massive success, as you allege, it was seen as a massive tactical blunder, as it increased support for Irish nationalism across Ireland, the UK, and internationally.

Not only that, it was seen as completely savage and cruel. The British public hated it. Even King George spoke out against it. To say it was viewed as a success is an absolute lie.

How can you expect the people of a country to understand the past in a nuanced way when Churchill is only mentioned in the context of the war and not in any other capacity. He was a flawed person, we all are. But we are not all leaders of an empire and we are not all responsible for millions of lives.

At least this action could start a dialogue about the ways in which the UK needs to improve its educational system. Maybe talking about the past, re:the atrocities committed in the name of British crown and how the U.K. was in a very real way built on the backs of black and brown people, could contribute a lot to combating racism...

4537,"&gt;Anyone should be at the protests in US because police brutality there is just insane. Take a look at what the police at there is doing to peaceful protests and tell me you condone it.

I don't condone it at all, but these protests are about some alleged systematic racism that is massively overblown. I also heavily condemn the violence that is extraordinarily common with these protests.

&gt;Watch the videos of police tackling black people to the ground and putting sticks in their hands.

The problem with these videos is that they don't give you the full picture. USA is a country of 330 million and there a lot of confrontations between police and the public. You can find plenty of videos of very violent protesters (one including a black cop killed for trying to resist looters), as well as police brutality, but most likely the videos are statistically insignificant when compared to all the confrontations. That's why I'm also against such triggered protests based on a single case, no matter how gruesome. 

&gt;Simply just watch. Just take a break from your ego and look at these people suffering under the hard boot of the US police.

So I could say the same to you, watch how many people are suffering because of the protesters and criminals among them. Probably several times more of such cases than because of the cops.

&gt; Imagine thinking that there isn't systematic racism in the US and police brutality against POC. 

Not confirmed by statistics, at least when it comes to dying due to police brutality. I can't say the same for random checks or biased prejudices, but these inconveniences are hardly worth the same reaction.

&gt; And imagine being more outraged that these people are upset at the system that favors white people against other minorities than the discrimination itself. 

Not only are they just upset at the system, they're getting upset at people who've done nothing wrong ‚Äì e.g. ""white privilege"". I get it that discrimination might exist on some level, but one should deal with the wrong-doers, not those that they claim are not discriminated. 

&gt;This isn't about you in Estonia, it's about them in the US, and it's about supporting their movement. 

Oh, I thought it was going down on my street before I read that. /s

And that's my point, I'm *not* supporting their movement and I don't think Europe should be doing it.

&gt;Like many have explained, BLM isn't about putting black lives above white lives, it's about pushing the idea that they matter as much as white lives, especially in the face of systematic police aggression.

Absolutely no relevant figure in the West has claimed otherwise in the modern era. As I also said, statistics confirm that their lives are not respected less. It's a made-up excuse.

&gt;Watch these videos again. There are far more incidents of cops being unneccsarily aggressive than people looting. Protesters who look at probobly like under 5% of the people present at these protests.

How exactly do you measure it? Is there a video database where you can count such cases? That's the thing with videos, they are not scientific data, unlike statistics.

&gt;I just don't understand why y'all weren't as outraged when far-right supporters and neo nazis marched in different European countries throughout the years? Seems like a bigger issue than people showing solidarity.

How exactly is that a topic right now? A weak case of whataboutism. FYI, I actually boycott far-right protests in my country. 

I'm not going to support a movement just because it claims to stand for minorities. If they lie, if unreasonable amount of violence comes along, they deserve to be opposed. I'm not going to feed an immature victim complex, lack of responsibility and absurd sense of entitlement that characterises the movement.

&gt;I'm not gonna argue further because I know I'll get downvoted anyway because I know what most of the [r/europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/) regulars think, but I do not agree with you and as a European, my opinion matters just as much.

You are free to disagree, but I'm also saying it might be a trendy movement in the USA right now, but that isn't an argument in any way in my eyes.

For example in Spain, there were only 531 cases of racism in 2018. There were 1600 hate crimes in total in 2018. Most of the crimes were threats only.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/gy7lfe/germany_poll_for_the_2021_general_election/ft9uy56/,rex-ac,1591542398

4612,"I think we're talking about different shades of conservative here the VVD in the Netherlands or Venstre in Denmark, the head of the right-wing in both countries for the last many years are the equivalent to the German FDP, not the CxU. In my opinion the FDP is staunchly conservative but so is the SPD, so is AfD of course and so is the majority of the Greens and much of the Left. The not-conservative faction is quite small. However the CxU has for the last many years maintained a policy of almost complete detainment, resisting any major change in any way. Merkels political agenda is best described as wait everything out and do nothing until it solves itself. The FDP or the SPD are at least incrementalists. They wouldn't completely sleep on infrastructure as the CxU does. That is a defining difference between the pure-blood old-school conservatives that want that everything stays as it is vs. the yuppie liberal-conservatives that would never take a chance on stagnation when money is involved. Denmark and the Netherlands are both filled with liberal parties. The political spectrum is different in the way that the liberal-conservatives have switched place with the christian-conservatives. The difference is also that in Denmark and the Netherlands alike the political system is much more dynamic and more varied. Merkel had 1 Cabinet per legislative period, all 4 of them majority governments with a single partner (FDP or SPD). Balkenende had double that ammount inlcuding one minority government and usually tripple coaltions. The CDA never had remotely the same grip on dutch politics as the CxU had on German politics, they're one party of many in a changing political landscape and they lost a lot of relevance in the last 10 years. They may slowly approach the same fate as the danish conservatives.",For a Europe of the Regions!,/r/europe/comments/gy7lfe/germany_poll_for_the_2021_general_election/ft9v1qp/,tobias_681,1591542455

4697,"While I agree the US is too trigger happy and am happy that this danish man survived so he could be properly punished by the justice system, I think it‚Äôs too simplistic to conclude that guns should be aimed at non-fatal areas.

Aiming a gun is incredibly difficult to do. When a police officer shoots their gun, it‚Äôs ‚Äòshoot to kill‚Äô because it‚Äôs quite hard to shoot someone in the knee. Guns should only be drawn when you intend to kill the perpetrator, and only as a last resort. It‚Äôs great if the perp is subdued without being killed, but should be a perk not an intention. Introducing measures stating that you should shoot to kill would be incredibly difficult - you‚Äôd have scenarios where police tried to aim for the knee (to injure) but end up hitting the femoral artery and the perp ends up dying, so the officer is charged with manslaughter/murder/etc... (let alone any target which is not the chest is way harder to aim at and therefore introduces an element of risk in someone *else* being shot).

4698,"I‚Äôll assume that you‚Äôre asking why or how Greece gets so much equipment for so cheap.

The answer can be very complicated, but the base mechanism at work here is the [EDA (Excess Defense Articles) program](https://www.dsca.mil/programs/excess-defense-articles-eda), which facilitates the transfer/sale of surplus and in storage equipment to US allies. Instead of scrapping retired and out of service equipment, the US gets to sell its second hand stuff for a bargain price (frequently asking for just the transfer costs), usually to any allied nation that asks. 

These transfers are approved in a case-by-case basis, and are subject to relevant geopolitical developments. In the case of Greece, the relations between the two countries are at an all time high, which means that pretty much any Letter of Intent submitted by a Greek delegation will probably be approved. 

In general, I think that good US-Greek relations pay a bigger role here than strained US-Turkish relations, when it comes to EDA at least. The latter manifests itself mostly when it comes to the sale of new equipment to Turkey. Theoretically, Turkey is long overdue to have been sanctioned under CAATSA by now, but interests and politics have prevented/delayed that. 

China on the other hand is out of the picture. Greece won‚Äôt buy Chinese armaments no matter what, and although the relations between the two countries are constantly improving, it‚Äôs limited to economic cooperation. The US has voiced concern when it comes to Chinese investments in Greece (as it has done in the case of every nation China is investing in), but China itself isn‚Äôt challenging US influence in Greece.

4769,"&gt; VW as largest car manufacturer in world surely will not stay behind any of its branch competitors, also it goes without saying for other three companies

I also don't think they will go down. However the federal government surely doesn't help them as Germany is much, much slower to switch to electrical cars than other countries. For VW and co. this creates a rift in their production. India has banned the sale of combustion engines from 2030, Norway has set it for 2025, Sweden 2030, Netherlands 2030, the UK 2032 or 2035, France 2040, etc. Germany does not have any phase out date. Most of these are important markets for VW and it will be very hard for them to become world leader in electric cars if their domestic market is so far behind.

&gt; Having same or nearly the same GDP pc as Denmark, Netherlands, Austria or Sweden is good thing not a bad one. First it means everyone is benefiting of open economy and being in EU, i.e. convergence is a positive sign. Secondly having robust economy that is production driven speaks of Germany's strength when standard of living is same as in small open economies like Denmark or in one service driven e.g. Netherlands. 

You misunderstand my point. Western Germany used to be richer and more modern than Denmark and the Netherlands. Today it's the opposite. That is not a sign of convergence but a sign of Germany falling behind. The standard of living is also generally lower.

&gt; Hundred of thousends of people would not try to reach Germany annually if benefits of it would outweigh costs. 

They went to Germany because Germany was one of the contries that was the most lax about rules and regulations, not because it was the most desireable destination per se. It doesn't really matter which Western European country you compare to e.g. Somalia (except Portugal maybe which is quite poor comparatively), what matters is how likely you are to be tollerated and/or supported by the authorities and possibly such things as the current status of the job market and language barriers. Sweden had a much higher influx per capita. Denmark and the Netherlands more desireable to emigrate to (not least because english is much more widely spread) if only they had the same attitude towards migration as Germany. 

&gt; Regarding 1990 data and ""Deutsche Widervereinigung"" you can see that GDR was way below Western Germany, Denmark and Netherlands and still after all the troubles in the early 1990ies Germany prospered and holds its place among highly developed economies. 

My point is not about the GDR at all. The GDR is better compared to Poland or Czechia. My point was exclusively about Western Germany. The nominal Western German GDP per capita is today 49.105 $/capita (entirely without Berlin for simplicity). As you can see it is a bit higher than that of Germany as a whole but not that much. But it's still more than 10.000 $/capita below Denmark or 22 % of Western German GDP. In 1990 Denmark was 1.000 $/capita or 7 % **behind** Western Germany. So comparatively Germany has absolutely massively fallen behind Denmark in the last 30 years starting in a position where is was comfortably ahead.",For a Europe of the Regions!,/r/europe/comments/gy7lfe/germany_poll_for_the_2021_general_election/ft9kkpq/,tobias_681,1591535765

You wanna fix black communities in the US today? Do away with the war on drugs, do away with the welfare thats all that the government can do. The rest is up to black people to fix their families to raise strong children in 2 parent households.

Racism is universally rejected nowadays and I believe in human rights which includes ban on racism. However, I have no special obligations towards minorities and because I take them as equal, I get despited when they are not taking responsibility and are trying to accuse everybody else of their misfortunes.

* Coronavirus: during the last week cca 300 people were infected, 7 died. Nevertheless restrictions being slowly lifted, and by 15th of June will disappear almost entirely. 
* Czech republic had the absolutely worst budgetary balance since its existence: by the end of may it was -157.4 billion CZK (cca -6 billion EUR). It is 1.5 times more than may 2010. Before the virus, the planned yearly deficit used to be 40 billion CZK. At this moment, no one knows how the yearly balance sheet would look like, expectations are between 300 and 600 billion CZK.
* To finance the ""entrepreneurs' compensations fund"", government plans to cut subventions to municipalities. It is a big deal, because in local politics, ANO party doesn't always have majority, so making municipalities fully government-dependent will equip government with a big stick to deal with them. Since municipalities will have decreased income from the local taxes as well, the overall hit is expected to reach 20% of the total budget. It is way more than the usual development budget, so municipalities will probably be forced not only to abandon any development, but also reduce day-to-day activities like public transportation. A group of opposition MPs plans to contest this decision in the court.
* To alleviate the damage to the freight companies, government reduced the taxation of the lorries by 25%, but for some reason **not** the taxation of the railway freight. So much about the ecological promises.
* Prague has reinstalled [Marian column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_column_\(Prague\)) on the Old Tows Square. The column has been erected in 1650 to celebrate the defense of Prague against Swedes and was demolished in 1918 by republican nationalists as a symbol of Habsburg domination. The question of re-erecting the column was regularly discussed and the magistrate always rejected it, but in January this year it suddenly passed, so the column is back.
* The parliament has elected a new chief of the [Supreme Audit Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Audit_Office_\(Czech_Republic\)). The new chief, Michal ≈†mucr, comes from the SPD (populist nationalist party), once again confirming the long-known fact that the current ruling party ANO basically rules with support of communists and populists.

Many of the jobs will doubtlessly be lost to automation in the next 10-20 years anyways but if Germany does as little to adapt to electricals cars as it currently does the entire industry could well fall behind global competitors and ultimately fall apart.

While Europe hasnt always in entirety been part of that sphere, France and Britain have long been so, west Germany was drawn into that sphere during the early stages of the cold war and later east Germany and the various nations of Eastern Europe that joined the EU. 

America is a large and powerful nation, and especially dominant in the western sphere. Our economy and general well being is tied to America being stable and responsible. Unfortunately, in the last decade or two, America has started becoming hyper polarised and more and more unstable. 

There are deep social problems in America, which due to their nature will relate to the American police. Add to this the general dislike of Donald Trump and his policies in many western nations, the perceived anti-Europe stance of the American isolaionists and the feeling that they are intimately connected to racism in America, and you have a perfect storm of feeling the need to protest.

Gr√ºne had gained so much popularity because people started to realize climate change was a real threat (with one of the driving factors behind this realization being the Fridays for Future-movement). So the surge in popularity of the CDU/CSU largely came at the expense of the Greens with some AfD and Linke sprinkled in.

5024,"Translation: 

**AUSTRIA**. ‚Äî Empire of pieces and pieces badly joined, always busy sewing and darning. When Hungary is reconsolidated, Bohemia breaks away, and when Bohemia is well adjusted, Croatia unfolds, and Slavonia suffers a hitch ... and always Gallicia unravels ... It is not surprising that this is the country of the districts: it takes at least sixteen to enter the court. We see some Austrians in Vienna, but they are as rare as the Turks in Constantinople ... Austria is on its decline, it is said ... No! it is his way of arriving ... by inclined plane.

**BELGIUM**. ‚Äî Everyone's neighbors, everyone's refuge ... and that we have centralized for the spillway. Gelding Nation! and very happy! All passions being forbidden to them, she lives in peace. We agreed to be Catholic on the one hand and liberal on the other ... and we throw our books at each other. History of having fun!

**DENMARK**. ‚Äî  Partial wall with Prussia accusing it of encroachment ... and of disturbing its water.

**ENGLAND**. ‚Äî It too is the first nation in the world, by cotton. Friend of the strong, provided they are very strong, protective of the weak, provided they are very weak. Cash wars, civilization with discount. It deals over the counter for revolutions abroad on the basis of free trade. Separated from France by the Times and the English Channel.

**EUROPE**. ‚Äî Fifth part of the world to which the equilibrists always make lose their balance. This balance is very threatened at the moment! Like always.

**FRANCE**. ‚Äî Seeking for fifteen months a government among its old defrocks, none suits her; all are too large, too small, too narrow or too worn. It is believed that by coquetry she prolongs her mourning which befits her to delight and makes her bigger! The other nations which pitied themselves on it, begin to chatter and wait with anxiety what France will decide, to know what they themselves will become.

**GREECE**. ‚Äî Country of Pericles, Socrates, Plato, Xenophon, Sophocles and Themistocles ... They have a king from Denmark because of the conformity of language and manners! He is the third successor to Codrus; second node of the question of the Orient! They start their history over with Hercules and Theseus, who purged the country of thieves. God grant that they will return to Pericles ... we need it badly.

**ITALY**. ‚Äî According to Mr. Farini, the first nation in Europe, at least by seniority, Mr. Crispi is of the same opinion for more serious reasons. She has the universe to claim and be sure that she will one day or the other ... and that this time France will not be ungrateful enough to forget that she was conquered by Julius Caesar ... He it is therefore not surprising that Prussia caresses it and that it caresses Prussia ..., among masters of the world! ! !

**THE NETHERLANDS**. - It's always Teniers, van Ostade, Potter, Ruysda√´l, and the Schiedam, and the bank and the tulips, and the washing, and the painted trees ... and a king ... because in a good house you have to have a king.

**PRUSSIA** ... ‚Äî It's Germany now ... - GERMANY. - It is Prussia ... a little Bavaria ... so be it little Wurtemberg ... Saxony half ... Baden and the Rhine provinces altogether ... and what will come ... Germany is the whole earth, it takes 365 days to make its revolution around the sun which is German, it has a moon which is German; Mr. Bismark promises him another. We eat hare stew with strawberry compote, its vinegars are highly esteemed and advantageously replace wine.

**RUSSIA**. ‚Äî It is also the first nation in Europe and in the world, since the Czar wants it. The Russians are very happy, since the czar wants it, very civilized, since the czar wants it ... and they will conquer all the earth, since the czar wants it, to spread civilization and orthodoxy there, since the czar the wants...

**SPAIN**. ‚Äî Always the military castanets and the fandango of civil wars. The contenders play there at the four corners, the republicans are the banderillos; in this race of bulls, they wave little red flags ... and run away. We change kings more often than linen. Great people constituted in civil war! The conservatives are called guerilleros and descend from Pelasge.

**SWITZERLAND**. ‚Äî The ranz of democracy cows.

**TURKEY**. ‚Äî A variegated Ioque on which everyone draws and whose pieces remain in their hands. The integrity of the Ottoman Empire! this is the dedicated formula! Another need for the famous balance! And the integrity of civil servants!‚Ä¶ Corollary: death is the best condition for stability for a power.",‚†Ä,/r/europe/comments/gy7rxk/europe_in_this_moment_french_historical_map_from/ft8xjm8/,Tyler1492,1591513971

I‚Äôm a white immigrant in Norway and talking to others the experience of light skinned immigrants is very different to many immigrants of colour who I speak to. My wife has found the same when she was an immigrant elsewhere.

The arguments are all of the same variety as yours, and I agree that immigration is a problem with no easy answers. But when I ask why they say my immigration is good but others aren‚Äôt they can‚Äôt quite give a clear answer, especially as I‚Äôm a classic ‚Äújob stealer‚Äù, doing a job a Norwegian could do.

They seem to mostly have a problem with immigrants from non-white ‚Äúcultures‚Äù. It‚Äôs common for the word culture in this context to be (unknowingly or purposefully) used as a substitute for race. It allows people to claim they aren‚Äôt racist whilst also being discriminatory. Those with the same opinions know exactly what they mean and others can be convinced into discrimination without realising it (a lot of politics is getting people to act the same way but for a variety of different reasons).

5072,"So like, Trump this week threatened trade tariffs on European cars if the EU didn't remove tariffs it had recently on American lobster exports to Europe. This was just a normal trade dispute. The EU last year put tariffs on US lobster because of alleged US subsidies to Boeing, while the US had other tariffs on AirBus due to EU subsidies to Airbus. Trump's action was a completely normal trade reaction to a long standing trade dispute. But when you read it in the paper it's reported as Trump betraying Europe or sabotaging global trade. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or like Immigration policy.... the US under Trump has way more liberal immigration policy than European countries. But when Trump tightened immigration policy because of illegal immigration from Mexico, that was always reported as extremist. The US currently has 12 million illegal immigrants. Now, compare that to European reactions to illegal immigration... which are way more severe but not reported as extremist. You see the asymmetry here?

As to the Chinese rise in the post decades, it was fueled by foreign investment, cheap labor and total disregard for the environment. As the CCP stated going nuts, so did foreign investment drop.  Due to the one child policy, the birth rate has been dismal for ages and now more people are going out of the labor force then in. This has hemorrhaged their economy as has created the 1 2 4 problem: 1 child needs to care for 2 parents and 4 grand parents. Normally a country would then import foreign labor, but the Chinese people are super racist and will not allow it. As to the environment, due to poor managment moody of the land is being polluted and the crops there are with bad quality. This had resulted in many deaths of the citizen there, but in the death of 1/3 of the pig population and this year in huge crop failure. 

Last week the premier of China said that 40% of the population is living under the line of poverty (which is 70 US dollars). Even the poorest country in the EU does not have such an insane poverty level. And were have to take the Chinese model as a success???

Because we don't talk often about China, not a lot odd people know how the situation is there and assume that it is good. And yes, the grass on the other side of the road does always seem greener, but don't be fooled.

When the US invaded Iraq, that was actually an idealistic move by Bush.

The US didn‚Äôt take any of Iraq‚Äôs oil, and the US spent like a trillion dollars in Iraq and rebuilding iraq, so there‚Äôs no motivation for the Iraq war other than misplaced idealism.

You know wars cost money and blood to fight right? People don‚Äôt spend blood and treasure for shits and giggles 

When France was in Syria and Libya, it had nothing to do with spheres of influence or security. They got in those conflicts for the same reason the US did.

5141,"&gt; Ah yes, because calling peoples‚Äô religions ‚Äúfairy tales‚Äù isn‚Äôt malicious. For not believing in fairy tales, you make a pretty nasty troll. Shitty one, but a troll never the less. 

You do the same thing every time you mention plenty of religions.

What do you think ""Mythology"" means? It's a belief in a myth ... AKA a fairy tale.

&gt;Here‚Äôa the thing. The fact you believe everyone who follows a religion believes 100% in a God is pretty naive. People follow religion for all different reasons. I think there‚Äôs some great lessons to be had for my kids. Do I even give a shit if there‚Äôs really a God? Meh. It‚Äôs a nice tradition though. 

Show me a religion without a deity ... I'll wait.

And you may not give a shit, but I believe that if people aren't taught critical thinking, and don't *actually* question this god narrative (btw, the majority of religious people on earth believe in an Abrahamic god)

&gt;Education started through religion you ignorant fuck

No it most definitely did not. Education pre-dates religion, seeing as nobody is born religious but are educating themselves from the second they are formed.

&gt;And you don‚Äôt seem like the brightest fellow, so where‚Äôs the argument for atheists being all that bright? 

I never made that argument. I made the argument that if you're dumb enough to believe in myths, then you're probably dumb enough to fall for plenty of other shit.

&gt;You seen a shining example of how they can be intolerant pieces of shit though, so there‚Äôs that.

Mate, there's nothing intolerant about calling people who believe in fairy tales &amp; myths dumb.

I'm not condemning them, or saying they aren't allowed to believe in utter nonsense ... they can do as they please, I just think it's a sign of a failed education system if the majority of people coming out of it believe in absolute unproven nonsense.

It's *literally* as dumb as believing the earth is flat, or that vaccines cause autism.

Doesn‚Äôt sound like oppression. Yes, police brutality exists, it may always exist, but its not ‚Äúoppressing‚Äù anyone. 

Holy shit pal, there were literal riots all over the US. And when there is a larger police presence and more violent confrontations on a broad scale, no shit there will be more deaths. How many of them were justified? Ironically that unravels your whole argument. If there was actual oppression, wouldn‚Äôt more people be dead?

Hong Kong police have been particular brutal pal and the CCP is about to establish its own intelligence forces in the city. People are literally disappearing and have been protesting on a wider level for much longer and yet somehow the US has it worse simply

I did not realize that my country was like China in that it was silencing dissidents, banning political criticism, banning mass gatherings, dragging people off in the dark for criticizing the President Winnie the Pooh, and causing millions of people to flew. 

Did I say the looting in Hong Kong was okay? 

Apparently, hundreds of small businesses being looted (those are people‚Äôs live savings there), setting fire to dozens of buildings and precincts, throwing Molotov Cocktails at the Police and running them over, assaulting and injuring bystanders, killing a retired police captain and looting his store, bashing a man‚Äôs head in with a skateboard, hitting an elderly couple with a 2x4, and basically breaking down social order to the point that the police were overwhelmed DIDN‚ÄôT call for the National Guard. 

And making a comparison between China, an actual dictatorship that holds captive a billion people, to the US, a republic with constitutional rights and liberties, is frankly disgusting.

For every good and successful thing an American company builds, the EU's (and especially Germany's) response is always ""we need to have our own version of that"".

So, the end result is that the companies tasked with building this will milk the EU and therefore the European tax payer as long as they can, without ever accomplishing anything, because it was impossible in the first place.

The technology existing Cloud providers offer is just not something that is easily replicated and the demand for a technologically inferior European solution is vastly overrated in my opinion. Large European companies will not choose an interior provider just because it is European. There is just no benefit (please don't say DATA PRIVACY, that's just not it works with large, multinational corporations). As for smaller companies, who don't have complex requirements, they already have many local providers to choose from for running their VMs.

5217,"you're correct, but you're also wrong about the fact that europeans somehow prefer socialism, switzerland is a direct democracy where europeans vote on things directly instead of per party, their welfare system is even more conservative thn the US (it is paid as a debt that must be paid back for 20 years after you last receive benefits) and is built on asset based means testing instead of income.   


Switzerland's health insurance is private (no medicaid), and pensions are heavily 401k leaning instead of universal like OASDI. The European ""support' for a welfare state is actually a myth, it's a reality of dependency that social democrats pushed through after campaigning on workers rights.   


If Germany or France adopted a referendum system, you would see welfare spending go down massively. The US Senate allows a more direct democratic system to come into place and thus the same happens, there is a reason why American incomes are so much higher thn European.  


Also, you are right: but its on both: white americans dont want to pay for blacks who do nothing, but it is the same for whites, white americans dont like the concept of white trash sitting on welfare all day, its the same in the UK. There is almost universal opposition to Hartz IV style benefits on all groups except the groups receiving them. But the nature of representative politics makes it hard to remove once enacted.

well yeah, when you are preparing for WW3, you want to avoid the enemy being in your ranks. Given that the US-UK just had Nuclear secrets leaked to the USSR from within our own ranks, it's safe to say paranoia was running rather high.

&gt;This is some heavy Randroid shit here. People can manage without elite.

Oh that's fucking rich coming from a Tankie whose ideology is all about that Vanguard party 

&gt;You are grossly overestimating the amount of competence necessary.

No, I'm not. Please, travel to the third world to see what weak institutions leads to. 

&gt;You tell me. You are the people who are objecting to this and claiming that it was all about liberating Europe from Nazis (and not about saving Nazis from Communists).

The Right Wing isn't all Nazis you twit. Eisenhower was a right winger when he went back to America and entered politics. Churchill was a right winger. Charles de Gaulle was a right winger. 


&gt;Also, ""moderately""? There is no ""moderately"" here. It was regular ""right-wing"". Should fascist order be necessary to keep things functioning, it would've been restored - this is why breakdown of monopolistic corporations (that supposed to prevent resurgence of fascism in Germany) did not stick.

Again, fucking rich from a Tankie. It wasn't West Germany that had to build a wall to prevent mass emigration, or that had to crush an uprising with Tanks and the Red Army in 1953, or that had a secret police that arrested you for wrongthink and which was described a Nazi-Hunter and Holocaust survivor (Simon Wiesenthal) as being as bad as the Gestapo. Fucking hell, Erich Mielke was already planning on mass arrests and imprisonments when the DDR was coming down hahaha, you're the ones who had to use men in jackboots to terrorise the population into obedience. 

&gt;Tell this to all the people who got shot by border guards for smuggling coffee from Belgium.

Please, do it, bring up borders. Do you really want to compare the DDR's Berlin Wall to the BRD's current open borders under the Schengen agreement? 

&gt;Nowadays there is ever-growing AfD - that is not suppressed in any way, but supported by existing parties.

Supported? *Growing?* The AfD are eurosceptics, literally unwinnable in Germany. Funnily enough though, they're most popular in former East Germany (and the NPD, the actual successors to the Nazis, only got elected in former East Germany too!) so much for that denazification you were boasting about. The Greens score better in opinion polls than the AfD.

&gt;If that is what ""the most socially liberal nations on earth"" look like, I don't care much for this ""social liberalism"".

Yeah god forbid things like Gay Marriage get legalised. The glorious Soviet Union, in its crusade for human progress and liberation, banned homosexuality (for men only, to top it off) and literally accused gays of being fascists and reactionaries. Wonderful beacon of human enlightenment. 

&gt;Why more people emigrated every year out of DDR legally than the total number of those who did it illegally?

Again, please bring up immigration. Did you know the DDR's population dropped by *2 million* over its entire existence? Meanwhile, millions of people were moving **in**to the BRD and still are doing so today.

Gender effects are found in both drug and non-drug offenses and greatly exceed the race and ethnic effects discussed above.

5405,"&gt;That part about holding a referendum anyway was tried in Catalonia. Didn't work out so well. The people thinking the referendum is invalid won't show, so the results are not a representation of the people in that case.

Different set up and the UK would both respond differently and I'd expect Scotland to act differently too. As I said, I wouldn't expect it to get that far (and if it did, I'd expect it to lead to a 'legitimate' referendum, not a UDI simply because the UK understands (see Ireland..) what happens when you block routes to an exit.

&gt;And that is also an issue, not everyone shows up. So how should we consider that. Are they actually happy with the status quo so they don't bother? I could see a possibility for a regular majority if that was calculated on the actual amount of people with voting rights, and not only the ones showing up.

The usual approach with a referendum that is boycotted by one side is that you need to get the equivalent of 50% on 100% turnout. If you have 100% of the people who want to leave vote, then you can see whether they have a majority or not..

&gt;The EU part is not bullshit I think. 

The claim about the UK blaming the EU is. UK governments have broadly worked hard to make the EU a non-issue and to hold down the power of eurosceptics. The idea that UK governments covered their misdeeds more significantly than any other EU member state by blaming the EU is a bit odd.

&gt;Britain did do things differently. The British government did not make use of the EUs possibilities to limit Eastern European immigration for years for example

Sure, but it wasn't actually an issue at the time to most people, that government didn't blame the EU for it either, it was understood that it was a choice.  Arguably few people were particularly bothered until mich later when the scale of FoM continued to rise, the level of EU migration to the EU was higher between 2012 and 2016 than the period where the UK could have restricted EE migration after all.

&gt;while they could, which was a major factor in Brexit. And the UK media with its tabloids is different from for example Germany or France, leading to more coverage of the clear lies journalists like Boris Johnson were making up. The Euromyth didn't come out of nowhere and those things do shape public perception.

A lot of those Euromyths are borderline attacks on the media for critical reporting of EU proposals. And to be clear, those same tabloids attack the government in the UK (And the devolved governments, and the US etc..) in the same way.

All that said, I think it's worth looking at alternative ways of dealing with major change, I think I prefer the UK's approach, and I don't like the supermajority requirement you are suggesting, although any approach needs checks and balances (Although find things like unchangeable components of Germany's constitution problematic, even if I agree with the content..).  In the context of Brexit specifically, the UK was always going to leave the EU at some point so in a practical sense, earlier is almost certainly better too, but even if that weren't the case, being able to make the change, over 4-5 years, with a lot of input, debate, representatives involved was a good thing.

For Scotland (and Northern Ireland, Wales etc..) the notion of them being forced to remain in a union when a majority don't want it is simply abhorrent. I think they are better off as part of the UK, I wouldn't want them to leave, but I don't get to tell a majority of people in those countries that they can't leave if there is a majority in support of that.

Responsible for ""the wrong decisions made""
The debate article lists examples of early statements by representatives of the Public Health Agency on the corona virus, statements that √Ökesson describes as ""grossly inaccurate"".

√Ökesson believes that state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell and others responsible for ""the wrong decisions made"" should resign.

Jimmie √Ökesson also accuses the government of ""weak political leadership"" and demands that the government take greater responsibility for the pandemic.

5465,"&gt;The usual approach with a referendum that is boycotted by one side is that you need to get the equivalent of 50% on 100% turnout. If you have 100% of the people who want to leave vote, then you can see whether they have a majority or not..

Then they should at least do this. If 50% of the actual population votes for it, then at least you can say it is a real majority.

&gt;A lot of those Euromyths are borderline attacks on the media for critical reporting of EU proposals. And to be clear, those same tabloids attack the government in the UK (And the devolved governments, and the US etc..) in the same way.

I don't agree. A ton of stuff has not been just critical, but straight up misleading or even lies because it sells newspapers. Some of that media seem to have clear preferences also. Which is also the case in other countries, but seems or be pushed to a more extreme in the UK. That has its impact on how people see the EU. The combination of that and the UK governments own failures and blame toward the EU is a bad combination.

And that is another issue with referendums like these and why you want a clear winner. Since not everyone is well informed, and even the ones that are don't know the full impact or results. So it's better to make really sure you got a ton of support before making such large changes.

5490,"When you browse the internet, you send packets of data to the server and the server responds in kind. For reading the news, you send out a request to download the various elements of the news page and the server of the website sends you the data back. The data is sent through relay stations that regulate traffic. These have a certain capacity. When a relay stations can handle 100 requests in total, but 110 requests approach it, it's going to build up a queue and resolve them with a delay. So even if your internet connection has a theoretical speed of 100Mbits, bad infrastructure can reduce it significantly in peak hours. 

But they can't do queueing indefinitely. Let's say it can handle 100 requests, and queue 20 per minute. But if it recieves 200 requests every minute, 80 packets are going to be dropped until the traffic gets back to 120. It means your request to the server or the data sent back isn't going to arrive. That's packet loss. Streaming sites are usually fine because they can buffer the video so if they don't get a packet they can request it again. Websites will only partially load. Video gaming servers will either disconnect you or your commands won't register in-game. You can lose submitted reddit comments because the packet that says that you just wrote a comment arrives but the content of it doesn't.

All in all it's the worst what can happen to your internet connection so it's the most important to do right. No reason to establish gigabit speeds if half your communication fails to arrive due to bad infrastructure.

Yes it's crazy to think that Telekom bases itself on this premise. But they get away with it because there's no alternative provider that does better.

It only gives the numbers from 2 protests witch were 3000(Sydney) and 4000 (London). In Europe it seems to be limited to Germany and England so it isn't really that big of a movement.

English being a lingua Franca matters, true, but especially in the countries mentioned above, it shouldn't, as they tend to dub everything.

&gt;Anime has grown massively in the US and across the western world in recent years for example, and has gone form being a very niche thing to fairly mainstream.

I feel like somehow, publishers haven't realized that yet, at least not here in Germany. Heck, when they brought Your Name to our cinemas, 2 god damn years after it was massively succesful in Japan, and after one of the statefunded tv channels aired a review of it in a mainstream (albeit not 8 o'clock) news show, they initially planned to show it in cinemas for two days.

From Turkey's perspective islands can't have EEZ(they can only have territorial waters of 6 nautical miles) and everything Turkey does is in accord with International Law. I am not sure where this is based(the International Law of Sea isn't signed by Turkey and according to that islands have EEZ) but I would like to know.

The Republic of Cyprus invited Turkey to solve this in the International Court of Justice but Turkey didn't accept.

There is a difference between Cyprus and Kastellorizo(Greece) because Cyprus is the third biggest island in the Meditteranean (compared to Kastellorizo is way bigger) and Cyprus is an independent sovereign island-state.

For casual racism, there are many anecdotes and news stories about racist incidents and it‚Äôs a good sign that they are reported and taken seriously. Whilst the plural of anecdote is not data, the best evidence is the FRP‚Äôs popularity, a party which considers dog-whistling too subtle and is openly racist and attracts like-minded supporters. The argument that people vote for them for other reasons falls down as they are openly racist and anyone voting for an openly racist party is at best supporting and condoning racism.

Oslo Police have reported a doubling in hate crimes for the last five years. [1] Reports are different to incidences, but it shows a real problem exists.

5637,"&gt;With a vote like independence or leaving the EU, after you've done it, you don't have the power to undo it. So Parliament can not overturn such a decision, like they can with regular laws.

The same could be said for joining the EU, moreover it could be said for any EU regulation in the sense that if one UK government agrees to it, the next can't really reverse it without being in breach of its treaty obligations. In short it's a matter of degrees (the UK could attempt to rejoin after all, and in the other direction, some legislation would be very hard to change once it is in place because it replaces a common law standard that can't be re-introduced..).

&gt;I already said joining the EU would come with the same rules if it was up to me. The other things you talk about are national issues that all can be overturned again later on and are not written into a constitution (which the UK doesn't have anyway, but in the case of my country).

Right but again, surely the point is that the UK system still makes radical change difficult while ensuring that it is about the aims of the majority, protected by the commons, Lords and courts. You seem to be suggesting that a system that makes change harder, at the cost of providing a mechanism for minority governance, effectively illegitimate leadership simply because people might change their mind in the future..

&gt;It is way easier to tell the losing side to take the results if the majority is larger.

Sure, but it's much harder to tell the losing side to accept the results if they also happen to be the majority. Again, can you imagine an EU referendum, or a Scottish independence referendum where a majority votes for a change, but now change follows because the minority view is large enough to prevent a supermajority? That would mean that a majority of people are being governed by a body that they disagree with, not just in political terms, but in a structural systematic sense..

&gt;Say Scotland gets a new referendum and they literally win by 1 vote for independence. You think that will lead to a healthy environment where everyone is just going to accept the results?

As opposed to the environment that would occur if there were a new referendum that goes 41/59 and so is won by the side with 650,000 fewer votes?

A narrow majority is something that can be accepted, an imposition by a minority position less so. Again, the only way you come to a different conclusion is if you take the position that the statu-quo is somehow an acceptable position to start with.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/gxnepo/poll_should_scotland_be_an_independent_country/ft604og/,-ah,1591470411

Your Irishness, whether you like it or not, colours your sentiment towards the British union because you have a negative position of the English due to what happened to Ireland, which is fair enough, but at least be honest with yourself about it.

5697,"Birds are considered to be good indicators of the diversity and integrity of ecosystems as their populations reflect changes in the populations of species they feed on, such as insects. Birds are highly mobile ‚Äì they can move elsewhere when their environment becomes unsuitable. This is why the presence, abundance and diversity of bird species tell a story about the condition of the environment and its development over time. Very importantly, birds are easy to observe (compared to most other groups of animals) and attractive to the public to monitor, hence a lot of data from bird observation are available.

In general, the populations of birds have been declining for several decades in the EU. While the decline appears to be slowing down in the most recent years, still, between 2000 and 2018, the EU's population of all common bird species declined by more than 4% and common farmland birds by almost 17%. In contrast, an increase of over 7% was observed for common forest birds.

The scientific community believes that major losses in populations of common farmland bird species can be attributed to changes in land use and agricultural practices, such as the disappearance of small non-productive landscape elements ‚Äì hedges and windbreaks, and the use of pesticides. The effects of these drivers could be reversed by the recently adopted Farm to Fork Strategy, seeking to reduce by 50% the overall use of and risk from chemical pesticides by 2030, and the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 aiming to bring back at least 10% of agricultural area under high-diversity landscape features and enlarge the area under organic farming so that it accounts for 25% of the total farmed land of the EU by 2030

Further morewe have VAT

&gt;Tax rates for VAT

&gt;There is also a reduced rate of 7 percent which is applied to the following goods and services, among others:  
&gt;  
&gt;Groceries  
&gt;  
&gt;Books, newspapers and other products of the graphics industry (however, not E-Books)  
&gt;  
&gt;Entry tickets for theatres, concerts and museums

5742,"I live in Sweden, I should know. I don't know if you live here (it wasn't clear from your message). Anyways, it was a joke about our national day not really being celebrated (we didn't even have a national day until the 80s) in the way for example Norwegians and Americans usually celebrate their national days. The weather wouldn't have helped either, but even if it would have been sun, most people would just have treated it as a day off from work (had it occured during a week-day).

Regarding the rest of your message, there are restrictions, although as you say we've been easier on them than basically all countries - but there have still been recommendations, and restrictions. All in all I'd argue we have done what the WHO and everyone else urged countries to do, that is to flatten the curve. Other countries basically annihilated the curve.

What will work out best in the long run remains to be seen. Our Ministry of Public Health (Folkh√§lsomyndigheten) have admitted though that they did fail on certain areas, such as protecting the elderly homes (where we, like in for example the UK, Ireland, Netherlands and Belgium) have had too many deaths for it to be acceptable. They've also more or less admitted that they failed with providing enough testing. That's being changed at the moment, which is why you see the number of confirmed cases going up again, while the number of ICU-hospitalisations and deaths continues to decrease.

Also we've seen massive demonstrations (far bigger than the ones in Sweden) in for example Austria and Britain. Whether that results in a surge in the numbers remains to be seen, but how people behave here isn't so unique in comparison to the rest of Europe right now. Will those countries close down completely again if the protests results in a surge?

All in all, after this rather lenghty message, what I want to say is that I do not necessarily defend how Sweden's treated the pandemic so far, but it's ongoing, and it's a very complex situation, so I argue that we will have to wait until the pandemic has ended until we can actually conclude how well or bad different nations have done.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/gxo4bs/june_6th_swedens_national_day/ft5e3r0/,Lusakas,1591463503

5755,"If the above happens, he wont have a choice but to either make a deal or go to another ellection.

If the SNP wants independence as a condition of support Labour will either have to give it or give them something else that they want more. Considering their raison d'etre is independence they are extremely unlikely to accept anything else. That is the issue for Labour. They will not be able to make a deal with the SNP without it as it would kill off their entire purpose for existing.

Remember what situation must occur for this to happen.

Tories 45% of seats Labour 40% of seats, SNP 11%, others 4%

The Tories win the most seats in parliament in the election before this but are short of a majority to the extent that they cannot form a government with the libdems or smaller parties. They refuse to give scotland an independence vote. Since they cannot command a majority they cannot form a government.

Then labour as the second largest party would get a go to make the government, but they too dont have enough to get over 50% without the SNP. So they then have to choose between a new election or giving in to whatever the kingmakers want.

This is what happened with the DUP in the last minority government. If you hold the keys to the castle you can ask for a lot. The alternative is risking losing power completely. Of course if this was Europe then a grand coalition would be possible but that is extremely unlikely in the UK context.

If labour allows indiref 2.0 they will have to decide if in a post scotland landscape they are hurt or benefited from proportional representation, as wtihout the SNP the math for labour getting back control in the near future look super bleak.

Scotland doesn't have a gigantic mountain range between Glasgow and Edinburgh that makes it easier to go via Berwick upon Tweed. Northern Ireland doesn't have a mountain range making it easier to go via Manchester than across the irish border.

Wales is basically three economic regions divided by mountains: South Wales, which is tied in to the M4 corridor, Mid-Wales which has closer ties to the midlands, and North Wales, who have stronger ties to Manchester and Liverpool. The best way to get from the north to the south is via England.

Even if an independent Wales guts the NHS for a couple of years to build a gigantic north-south motorway connecting everything, the economic geography still means the opportunity offered by trading with Bristol, Bath and eventually London is far greater than the same opportunities North Wales offer to Cardiff based firms, and vice-versa with North Wales Firms and the North West.

There's plenty of uniquely Trump fuckery going on nowadays (e.g. his abysmal handling of Corona), but your list is really stretching it on some particular points.


&gt; attacking the press and calling them ""fake"" (l√ºgenpresse)

Let's be real here: did anyone *from the left wing* actually trust American media before Trump? Of all things to criticise Trump for, I don't get this one. Calling the New York Times or CNN ""fake news"" isn't a right wing invention, they stole that from the left. NYT, Washington Post, etc. were *always* accused of lying to suit the American government's needs; but suddenly when the American president says they're lying, everyone does a 180 turn and acts like they were always the beacons of honesty and virtue in the USA. Chomsky has gone on for years talking about manufactured consent and the media's role in it, is Noam Chomsky (the Jewish Anarchist-Syndicalist) a ""Nazi"" too now?

&gt; actively spying on foreign countries and citizens (NSA)

Not only was that revealed during Obama's presidency, that is hardly something unique to the American's presidents. The USA catches Israel spying on them all the time, and they're allies too. During WWII, we had our own spies working in the USA to churn out pro-British propaganda and make the Yanks sympathetic to us before they joined the war. Everyone is always spying on everyone, that's the point of spies, they aren't made to sit around and wait for information to reach them via osmosis. Even bloody Switzerland has been caught spying. 


&gt; overthrowing socialist countries

On the topic of D-Day, President Eisenhower (the bloke that commanded the Western Allied armies in Europe against the Nazis) overthrew more socialist governments than Trump ever has. Actually, I don't think Trump has successfully overthrown anyone?


&gt;Wait until he has full power (and I bet he will),

5820,"&gt;The state = ‚Äúrepresentatives‚Äù (elected or not, depending on the flavor of socialism) of the workers, as in your Microsoft example. The state controls the means of production. What contradiction do you see?

The workers can definitely own a company in a socialist society, the process is just different than how you'd do it in a typical capitalist society.

&gt;When Microsoft was founded by Gates and Allen, do you consider this very capitalist company operating in a capitalist system to have been a socialist company? 

No because it wasn't founded in a socialist mainframe and neither did it work or had a contact with one.

&gt;Still looking for your definition of socialism, by the way. 

Will edit this part later, was arguing with one guy already and I wrote there how I see the def of socialism.

EDIT:

""The main component of socialist economic policy is a directly planned economic plan with heavy interventionism from either the state, unions or collectives that focuses on disbanding hierarchical order within the workforce, limiting the effect of the capital (in most cases completely getting rid of it, market falls under the same category), which is also inherently opposed to consumerism and existence of megacorporations or in case of more moderate socialism - limiting their reach and power considerably.

I may get something wrong with definition as, again, it is a vast subject with varying spectrums of ideologies, approaches, etc, so my definition that I think is a broad generalisation of the far-left economics might have holes here and there, I apologise for that.""


&gt;Are you seriously trying to say Lenin was a Democratic Socialist? I wouldn‚Äôt hold up the system under Lenin (who led the revolution and the eventual founding of the USSR) as a successful example, but again you seem to have different criteria.

Lenin was not a DemSoc, he was a self-identified social democrat, like nearly all big socialist policial figures during that era. Lenin is his late age understood that USSR to survive would need to work within a capitalist system (the mainframe) to prosper and fare well, which is why his very late policies had a social democratic character. Lenin overall was an interesting character, at one point even seeing the revolution as a mistake. He's an interesting read and definitely a conflicted man in charge of something new he didn't know how to shape.

&gt;I do agree the USSR was the result you usually get when you concentrate that much power into the hands of the few in the name of socialism, but they never allowed workers control over the means of production. It was always their representatives.

Originally there were no representatives. The first ever bolshevik state, so to speak, was an union of soviets (radas), only when the civil war has basically been decided already did the state's functions form and the representatives were put in place. That's not to say that the process was supposed to be democratic and there were supposed to be independent workers' communes... but well, we know how that ended...

&gt;The USSR collapsed due to an invasion? 

Nope, this one is an exception. It collapsed due to being closed off to the rest of the world and oppression of the common people - two main things.

&gt;Catalonia has never been a separate country for long enough to see whether they were a success or not, but their fall arose from violence stemming from massive election fraud, which speaks against their long-term prospects. 

The alliance between the republicans and anarchists was already falling by that point, I will add. It was doomed mostly because of little outside help, Soviets really weren't interested in ""Spanish Makhnovia"".

I can't argue with this as it's literally the exact same logic I've used just used in the opposite direction. On the other hand, however, the voting surrounding Scotland's independence and Brexit was different to these things for the simple reason that it was a vote to change something established that was never meant to be changed. When we have elections, we're changing the establishment, but in the same breath, Parliament was never meant to stand for more than 5 years at a time, whereas the British membership in the EU, and Scotland's membership of the UK, was something that was established as a permanent fixture.

To be honest, I don't agree that 50% is a strong enough majority for an election, either, and FPTP is a shit system - but at the same time, I do not have the answers.

Targets included telephones, faxes and computers in the White House, the State Department and the US Treasury Department.

Spiegel claimed it had seen a list of so-called ‚Äúselectors‚Äù: telephone and fax numbers and email addresses the BND was covertly monitoring between 1998 and 2006.

Among them were 4,000 targets in the US, including government departments, foreign embassies and international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the Arab League.

Military targets included the US air force and marine corps, and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA).

The BND also spied on NGOs, including the New York-based organisation Human Rights Watch.
