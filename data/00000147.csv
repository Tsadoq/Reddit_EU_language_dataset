15,"&gt;We are lining up to get an unprecedented U.S. bilateral trade deal and Canada, Australia and New Zealand are lining up for the same

This not only sounds like a Trump talking point, it isn't accurate:

&gt;One of Liam Fox’s trade envoys has quit in protest that the government’s no-deal Brexit policy threatens the demise of an existing trade deal with Canada worth £800m.

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-news-latest-trade-envoy-quit-deal-canada-a9012421.html

&gt;... formal talks between Canadian and British officials over a post-Brexit trading arrangement ground to a halt weeks ago. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, Britain will offer radically reduced tariffs to all comers. Canadian officials, reasonably, decided there’s no need to offer concessions in return for what would be essentially automatic access to the U.K. market.

https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/canadas-brexit-talks-with-the-u-k-there-are-none/

Amazing how the Canadian 'insiders' you mention, without citation, didn't know about the trade discussions grinding to a halt!?

More than likely New Zealand, and Australia will be taking advantage of the same automatic access.

&gt;A committee set up in the United States to protect the Belfast Agreement has warned the incoming Northern Ireland Secretary that a future US-UK trade deal will be “all but impossible” if the peace accord is undermined.

Last, Poles were expelled themselves from their Eastern Territories. I have family that came from Kresy and none of them were exactly keen to live on ""German territories"". Hell, we never received any form of compensations nor could we create groups for expelled Kresy Poles, unlike Germany with their ""Vertriebenenverbände"", simply because the whole country of Poland was under communism.

The main point still stands that if no acceptable solution exists for the Irish border the EU can refuse to do any sort of FTA and apply tariffs/barriers to trade to create nearly the same situation as would exist in a “full no deal”.


 All passing a modified WA would do is give a 2 year window to see if a future relationship can actually be negotiated with a frictionless border. If it isn’t possible, then at least citizens rights will be protected, and the EU will definitely get their money, I suppose the other aspects of the WA are a minor concession to the UK, but still it seems logical from the EU side to relent on the backstop.

282,"1. Wrong, the UK government *asks* to set a tariff schedule and every single member of the WTO gets a vote on whether or not it should be granted. That includes EU countries by the way.

2. The EU is setting external tariffs on beef to protect the farmers of its members. If the UK does what you want it to, i.e. drastically lowering these tariffs to import cheap beef from South America, you're going to decimate British farmers.

 Furthermore, 90% of British beef exports go to the EU. Again, if they lose access to that market, beef prices in the UK will increase because demand for British beef outside the EU is rather low due to being priced higher than locally produced beef (lower labour costs &amp; food standards), so beef production will be scaled back and most of it will be sold in the UK. [This is  exactly why Michael Gove said there would be high tariffs (40%) on beef imports in case of a no-deal Brexit (compared to the ~12.8% tariff the EU sets on most beef imports).](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-46749572) So that British farmers have at least one market they can reliably sell in.

And hey mate, fuck you with that Afghanistan comparison.

Denmark continuedly fought side by side with the British in the Helmand Province, so before you start comparing things, think about who your European supporters were you ignorant bastard.   


Denmark supported the American campaign in both Iraq and Afghanistan far more than most European countries, and proportionally speaking lost a lot of soldiers per capita. 

"" With a new mandate issued by the Danish parliament in 2006, Danish military operations transformed from relatively safe non-combat operations in the centre of the country to combat operations alongside the British contingent in the violent southern [Helmand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmand) province. 37 soldiers have been killed in various hostile engagements or as a result of friendly fire, and 6 have been killed in non-combat related incidents, bringing the number of Danish fatalities to 43,[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_casualties_in_Afghanistan#cite_note-41)[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_casualties_in_Afghanistan#cite_note-42) being the highest loss [per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_capita) within the coalition forces.[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_casualties_in_Afghanistan#cite_note-43) ""

From  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition\_casualties\_in\_Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_casualties_in_Afghanistan) 

1. Population of America roughly 327 million: 2313 casualties, that's one death per 141.375 people
2. Population of UK roughly 68 million: 456 casualties. that's one death per 149.123 people
3. Population of Canada: 37 million: 157 casualties. that's one death per 235.669 people
4. Population of France: 67 million: 90 casualties. that's one death per 744.444 people
5. Population of Germany: 83 million: 57 casualties. that's one death per 1.456.140 people
6. Population of Italy: 60 million: 51 casualties. that's one death per 1.176.470 people
7. Population of Poland: 38 million: 44 casualties. that's one death per 863.636 people
8. Population of Denmark 5.8 million: 43 casualties. **that's one death per 134.884**

Proportionately  Denmark lost more soldiers than your country, so don't go say we did nothing. It is a fact that Denmark have supported the American wars and interventions consistently and effectively for near on two decades in the middle east. 

Btw. the next countries are respective:

Australia, 24 million people, 41 casualties  
Spain, 45 million people, 35 casualties  
Georgia, 3.7 million, 32 casualties  
Romania. 20 million, 26 casualties  
Netherlands, 17 million, 25 casualties  
Turkey, 72 million, 15 casualties  
Czech Republic, 10 million, 14 casualties

So how about you get enlighted before you spread your bullshit, if America does not want to protect Denmark they're the largest hypocrits in the history of hypocrits.

If they wanna pull out of Nato, you bet that the European nations will find an alternative.

Give it 10-20 years more and your glorious nations will no longer be the superpower you want it to be.

2. There are a lot of ethnic Russians within our Army and even some citizens of Russia who decided that to help us fight Russia is the best way.
3. ""Vatnik"" is not a synonym to ""Russian"" - it's purely about political views and was invented in Russia as a name for Putin supporters in 2011.
4. Dombass was taken from a famous photo where Russian ""liberators"" failed to write ""Donbass is independent"" without mistakes. Those times Russians still pretended to not be involved so that makes it twice as funny.
5. Speaking of ethnic suppression, what Russia does to Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians is a crime. Total suppression, kidnapping and torturing in Crimea and mass murders in Donbass. Sooner or later you'll be get the consequences.

332,"&gt; If Trump is being hypocritical, it means that, contrary to the popular opinion, he gives a shit about democracy to some degree. Hypocrisy and diplomacy are inseparable. 

that's just an absurd mix-up of three totally separate and unrelated things. So fyi:

* democracy is letting the majority decide
* hypocrisy is saying one thing and doing the opposite
* diplomacy is the art of dealing with other people (e.g. representatives of another country) in a sensitive and tactful way

Trump is being hypocritical because he talks about wanting partner countries to not be energentically dependent when in fact he schemes to keep/make them dependent … on the USA

As for the rest, it's absurd as well:

&gt;  Germany buying gas from Russia over Eastern Europe's heads makes the whole idea of NATO with Germany in it a joke. It's absurd to protect Western Europe when it doesn't bother to protect itself and does business with the very state it's supposed to need protection from

That's a rather misguided and belligerent idea of what NATO is. NATO is not about limiting business to whoever the USA would like to dictate to be okay. NATO is about mutual DEFENSE in the case of an attack. The belligerent Trump strategy of escalating against Iran, Russia etc. is not in the interest of that defensive strategy that was originally at the core of the NATO but opposed to it. Trump, Bolton and their fellow warmonger buddies have repeatedly expressed their dislike for the NATO… obviously because it doesn't fit their escalative agenda.

And no, doing peaceful business with Russia is precisely the base of what cements peace. Which is how France and Germany became best friends quickly after having been arch-enemies during the wars. And which is also why Trump wants to sow enemity between the EU and Russia. Trumps biggest fear is that the EU and Russia could be friends, which would go against US domination of Europe.

Finally, ""over Eastern Europe's heads"" sounds like an absurd entitlement attitude. Of course some Eastern European countries are not happy about losing control and transfer payments by a direct middleman-free pipeline between Russia and Germany. But there's no entitlement to that.

338,"I wouldn't rest assured on that front:

&gt;Under the existing equivalence rules, recognition is decided unilaterally by the EU and can be revoked at any time. The move does not alter the EU’s medium-term goal of coaxing business to relocate. Indeed, argues one London lawyer, it merely allows the EU to do so in a “managed and controlled”, rather than chaotic, way.

&gt;Some European officials have made their intentions very clear. On November 23rd François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the Banque de France, said that any temporary recognition of British clearing-houses should not last more than a year.

https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/12/01/europe-makes-contingency-plans-for-clearing-houses-after-brexit

&gt;EU rules stipulate that the bloc’s banks can only use authorised clearing houses. Significantly, those in London would lose this status in the event of the UK exiting the EU in March without a withdrawal deal. Under the EMIR II proposal,1 Euro-denominated clearing may only be allowed under the direct supervision of ESMA [European Securities and Markets Authority]

&gt;the European Commission and the ECB ultimately want to see more euro-denominated clearing located in the Eurozone under the bloc’s direct supervision under the ESMA, once Britain becomes a non EU state. Equivalence in the transitional period prevents immediate disruption in the central clearing of derivatives, yet transitional periods are temporary by nature

https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en-de/knowledge/publications/9e4b5910/clearing-the-euro-temporary-solution-only-on-offer-in-a-no-deal-brexit

If the UK leaves without a deal, the EU will pull transitional agreements when it suits them - not when it suits the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

As of 2016, Hungary is 98,3% Hungarian. So what 7,6% are you talking about? That might in that specific locality and that doesn't mean much. We have minorities that only consist of several villages, not even a city and they have education in their own language (look up the Croatian minority in Romania, they have even a high school in Croatian). Hungarians are totally allowed to publish whatever they want in Romania in Hungarian. Go to cities in Szeklerland and you will see all banners and ads are in Hungarian and that's not an issue. The flag of whatever country you want can be put wherever you want, except for public institutions, unless it's accompanied by the Romanian one. I am almost certain the Hungarian legislation says the same, I'm yet to see a public institution in Hungary with a flag that's not the Hungarian one alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hungarians even sign petitions to revise Trianon, that won't change shit my friend. The truth is minorities in Romania are actually very well-treated. The simple fact that all minorities in Romania have BY LAW at least one seat in the Parliament (except Hungarians that have a political party, so they get even more and also in some counties, the Germans) and you can get schooled in Romania in your own language (Hungarian, German, Croatian, Serbian, Turkish and I believe even Slovak) means we do treat them right. As for the shit you were saying there...That's not true, I've been in the hospital in Targu Mures and so many doctors and nurses spoke Hungarian too (so going deeper into Szeklerland, I doubt the situation is any different). Of course those who weren't born in the area and get to live there won't speak Hungarian and the truth is, they have no need to do it. It's Hungarians who need to speak the national language of the country they live in, not us having to learn a different language to be able to talk to other Romanian citizens. You are the living example of that if you truly are a Szekler, since you're not able to speak Romanian. Why don't you realize the only ones who suffer from this is you? You have nothing to lose from learning a language in general, even less the official language of the country you live in. The Hungarians are in general a very badly integrated minority in all countries and that's because you refuse to integrate. When you don't do so, integration is super easy.

407,"Scotland has a deficit - but is not a country ?

Surely its a UK budget issue a financial mis-management issue owned by Westminster ?

But of course I forget Devolution = Full fiscal responsibility ? 

Deep diving into this:

If Sainsbury has operations in Scotland but these are taxed and paid through their London HQ to HMRC in London this is technically value raised in Scotland but recorded in London - GERS does not adequately reflect value raised in Scotland 

*Can you even imagine the untapped wealth of companies that operate in Scotland but pay taxes in England instead paying taxes to an Independent Scotland* - before we even slap 70% Green Tax on Oil

As such the South East has, surprisingly enough, a surplus as a result of being the UK’s HQ 

But this South East surplus is not enough to ensure all of England is in the black 

Both England and the UK as a whole runs at a deficit so how on earth can Scotland account for over 50% of the UK deficit ? 

The UK deficit is 23 billion

Scotlands alleged deficit is 12 billion 

Wales is 13 billion ? 

Thats 25 billion but England and NI also run at a deficit ??? not a surplus 

GERS figures are a unionist metric designed to illustrate an Independent Scotland can’t financially support itself

Then theres the curious case of squandered Oil and the missing 500 billion

515,"&gt; They weren’t six random counties, come on be honest. That was were the majority of Scottish people settled, hence they had a large Protestant population. I do agree though, Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh should be part of Ireland

I bring you back to my very first statement. You’re currently arguing over an ambiguity in what was written. This (from my previous statement) clears up what I meant. But I’ll elaborate for you’re fairly tedious. By Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh being part of Ireland, I meant that they are and always have been majority Catholic and should have been part of the Republic. 

&gt;you’re English, you inevitably know nothing about Ireland. 

I shouldn’t even respond to this as it’s the bigoted argument of a salty internet troll but hey ho.

Firstly: Don’t assume the person you’re speaking to knows less than you - that’s arrogant and condescending 

Secondly: Don’t assume that my English background means I have no knowledge. The Troubles affected us too and so it is good to have a historical knowledge of what happened.  I would t begrudge your knowledge of British history as you are Irish. 

The day I was born in London the IRA bombed Canary Wharf. My family couldn’t visit me. 

I live in Manchester, the city centre was completely destroyed. 

My best friend’s Mum is a strict Northern Irish Protestant and her Dad is from an Irish Catholic family from Manchester; her dad (the Catholic) was a policeman in the troubles.  

I also have an Irish Glaswegian friend who has ‘tiocfaidh ár lá’ tattooed on their arm.

I’m an English lurker in r/Ireland who has said that the counties that have always been catholic majority should have remained part of the Republic.

529,"&gt; for the Danish PM to call it absurd is only mildly critical. Certainly not upsetting enough for a world leader to postpone an official state visit over at the last minute.

The Danish PM publicly replied with an inappropriate, undiplomatic, and disrespectful response that lacked the tact expected from an alleged trusted ally. If she is unwilling to treat the American head of state with an ounce of dignity, why should he be expected to respond amiably and kindly? The first lesson taught to children in most cultures on earth is to treat others how you would like to be treated. To expect anything else is stupidity.

&gt; Particularly after the Cold War the US (in our eyes) has cultivated the image of an aggressor, as shown in the multitude of wars in the Middle East, and we're not interested in following that.

I understand that the US’s response to the attacks on its homeland that took place on September 11, 2001 is not in the national interests of most countries of Europe. We didn’t go to the Middle East  for the benefit of Europe. We went to the Middle East in response to an act of war that targeted our civilians. 

The US is not a passive country. If you attack the US, we will respond. Is that concept really so difficult to grasp?

&gt; I don't quite understand your last sentence. We're criticizing Trump and his administration's policy here. What values, traditions, rights and cultures of the US are we showing contempt towards?

European media rails on American culture. When I was an exchange student in Germany, I had professors telling me to not vote for Bush for President. I thought this was highly inappropriate. But it showed me that Europeans generally regard Americans from a position of self-righteousness. They think they know better and how things should be done here instead. I saw political cartoons painting Americans as uneducated cowboys. I saw demonstrations with tens of thousands chanting derogatory slogans towards the US and burning our national colors. 

Europeans disrespect our Constitution. They criticize our constitutional amendment regarding free speech and think we need to ban what they deem “hate speech”. This shows how they lack an understanding of even the very basics of American values. They are amongst the most critical in the world regarding Americans’ rights to possess and carry arms. These are internal domestic issues that have been around for centuries, and it is something Europeans have no business condemning.

But it is this incessant European urge to treat anything different as inferior and unnecessary that concerns me.

These attitudes, the hostile rhetoric, indifference to our culture and history, and absolute contempt are totally unbecoming of a worthy ally.

And it is not like Americans love to spend billions of dollars annually on the ungrateful just so that they can spend money on themselves instead. I urge you to contact your political representatives and express your desire to have the US’s military bases relocated outside the continent. You don’t want us there, and we don’t want to be there.

But in the case of German crimes against Poland - the German state was the perpetrator, that's why we ask the German state.

&gt;The languages of Oïl are sometimes considered as dialects of French, according to the most traditional classification of Romance linguistics, itself derived from a transposition of the medieval linguistic situation to the present period. In this perspective, the oïl language is then used in the singular, because it is considered as a language, formed by all varieties of oïl. The latter can be considered as dialects of oïl. However, this design is problematic for several reasons.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the one hand, French then becomes an ambiguous term, referring both to a language, the langue d'oïl, and to a particular dialect of that language, French. However, these two definitions each contradict the legal status of French in France, which is not considered as a dialect, but only as a language, to the exclusion of the other linguistic components of the domain of oïl.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the other hand, intercomprehension has been defined as a criterion for defining languages. It was also noted that inter-comprehension was not always effective within the linguistic components of the domain of oïl.  
&gt;  
&gt;The argument that varieties of oil could not be distinct languages because they form a linguistic continuum was also put forward. However, the linguistic continuum is actually much more important. It extends as far as Lisbon and Trieste. This simple criterion would therefore make it possible to include, among other things, Occitan, Catalan, Spanish and Portuguese in the same language because of the existence of transitional speakers. Moreover, the linguistic continuum as a criterion for defining a language requires taking into account cases of language islands belonging to larger linguistic groups and encounters cases of hyphenation within the same linguistic group.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/cs30pg/romanic_languages_and_dialects_in_europe/exkw6jc/,Gaufriers,1566400372

Yes, but for the majority of the continent it didn't take off until the lattter half of the nineteenth century.

&gt;Ya know what you’re right, the Africans should be thanking Europe for everything they’ve done. All of that western medicine, food, and technology certainly made its way down to the lowest levels of society and wasn’t used solely for the benefit of the elite. 

It very clearly has not just benefited the elites. African elites are not the only ones who are having big families that are surviving to adulthood. Africa would not have experienced the [population explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Africa) that it did (and continues to experience) without European medicine, food, and technology. 

&gt;The average African is absolutely better off having been colonized, lack of hands, culture, and traditional society be damned.

I'm not disputing that there were really awful things that happened during Europe's reign over the continent. I'm just saying that without Europe, Africa would be in an even worse state than it is today. Seriously think about it. How high would their infant mortality rate be, how common would famines be, how high would their population be, how common would slavery be, etc.? Think about how most of Africa doing before the Europeans arrived and try to imagine how it would have gotten to where it is today (which is still not a great spot) without Europeans. I see no reason to believe that it would have ever reached its current point.

&gt;Does the Aztecs being dicks justify the destruction of culture in modern day Mexico? If the Chinese were superpowered and took over Europe in the Middle Ages would that be a justified action just because France was a superpower conquering regions of Europe?

Instead of religious events, people organized festivals, worker unions, collective farms that all incentivised unity.

800,"Taken from a different article about the exact same issue:

 

&gt;There has been no formal reparations between the two countries.  
&gt;  
&gt;Poland’s foreign minister Jacek Czaputowicz, told the DPA news agency: ""There are countries that lost many times less but received more compensation.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Is that acceptable?""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The demand comes ahead of a visit by Germany President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who will attend a ceremony to mark the 80th anniversary of the Nazi invasion on September 1 in Wielun, the first Polish town to be attacked.  
&gt;  
&gt;The sum of £777bn has been calculated by Poland's ruling Law and Justice party which has formed a parliamentary committee to do the sums.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to Die Welt newspaper, Arkadiusz Mularczyk, the chairman, will demand the sum in a report to be published on the day Mr Steinmeier visits.  
&gt;  
&gt;But Germany insists it owes nothing.  
&gt;  
&gt;It points out that Poland and the Soviet Union agreed in 1953 to forgo further payments.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yet Warsaw maintains the communist government was pressurised by Moscow into the settlement.  
&gt;  
&gt;Up to 2018 Germany has paid £70 billion compensation to other countries afflicted by the Nazis murder, according to finance ministry figures.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In October Greece signalled it was reviving legal claims against Germany for almost £220 billion over Second World War atrocities.  
&gt;  
&gt;German occupation from 1941 to 1944 claimed the lives of more than 300,000 civilians and caused major damage.  
&gt;  
&gt;In April Greek MPs voted to put to put pressure on Germany to cough up. Part of the new compo drive is motivated by austerity measures imposed by Berlin in exchange for EU bailouts.

855,"&gt; Sorry but what? You are making barely any sense. You jump from point to point without any indication of what your point is and throw data in seemingly at random, this makes it very hard to follow.

What exactly doesn't make sense to you?

&gt; Yes my numbers are not exact, that wasn't the point. My point was that a vehicle half the size (1.5 is not half of 2.5 obviously) will use half the energy, thus needs half the battery size to reach the same range.

That very much depends on the driving conditions. At higher speeds, it won't be half the energy for the simple reason of aerodynamics not being weight-dependent. So it's hardly as simple as that. *Especailly* once you're talking about driving maximum range; it makes sense to assume that it's not ~300 km at city speeds.

&gt; And 1.5 ton total weight should be easily reachable. Cars that weight 2.5 tons are literally a waste of energy and resources. Or to say it another way: You can build 2 EVs weighing 1.25t with the resources required to build 1 2.5t EV. And well, when it comes to components for batteries, we are limited in the sources we can tap as far as we know.

Technically a 1.5 ton vehicle is most likely also a waste of energy and resources for most people, but that's probably a topic for a completely different discussion about modes of transport.

&gt; Edit: To make my point even clearer. Those SUV sized EVs cost more per km to drive than petrol or diesel based cars. 22kWh per 100km means a price of 6,60 € per 100km.

Weird. At local BEV rates, it comes out as something like €2/kWh. You seem to be getting screwed somewhere.

&gt; An Opel Astra (i take that car because i drive it, but it's a shit car where i had to replace the transmission already, fucking hell...) requires about 4L of diesel. Let's even say 5L (above what mine requires and it's 10 years old) With a price of 1.25 € per L we get a cost of 6,25 € per 100km.

Opel Astra is not a comparable vehicle to a heavy electric SUV . Not quite sure why you're not pitting, say, an SUV against an SUV, a compact car against a compact car, etc., like I did. This is you barely making sense to me. Model 3 is at ~16 kWh/100 km, BMW i3 is as around 14 kWh/100 km or something like that. That's on average around €1.3/100 km or so here. 

If you don't want an SUV, don't buy an SUV. But complaining that Tesla's fairly efficient large SUVs are not better than compact cars seems like barking up the wrong tree to me.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/csxias/german_electric_car_rental_nextmove_cancels_5/exkdw4h/,ObnoxiousFactczecher,1566385979

1126,"Up to half a million unregistered Syrians living in Istanbul faced being expelled from Turkey’s largest city, as the government stepped up a crackdown on undocumented migrants.
Tuesday marked the deadline for all migrants living in Istanbul without permits to leave the city, or face forcible removal. Turkey has provided a haven for 3.6m Syrians, about half of all the refugees who have fled the eight-year war that has killed at least 400,000 people.
But a painful economic downturn in the past year has soured sentiment, as Turks fret that Syrians are taking scarce jobs and straining state finances. The Turkish government, the world’s biggest host of refugees, said it had spent $37bn caring for Syrians since 2011.
The Istanbul governor’s office said 2,630 Syrians papers had been rounded up and taken to other provinces in July alone, ahead of the August 20 deadline.

Human Rights Watch and other aid groups have documented cases of Syrians deported to Idlib, the besieged Syrian province where government forces are battling to capture the last opposition stronghold. More than 3m people are trapped in Idlib, where the UN has warned of a looming humanitarian catastrophe.
International law prevents sending refugees back to lands where they face violence or persecution.
Immigration officials reject the allegations, saying only Syrians who have signed consent forms are taken to safe areas under the control of the Turkish military along the border.
The crackdown could have implications for the EU, which has relied on Turkey to keep migrants from travelling to Europe. The EU agreed in 2016 to dispense €6bn in aid for refugees in Turkey, but Ankara has said the bloc is failing to shoulder enough of the burden.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s vigorous advocacy for his “Syrian brothers and sisters” helped restrain a public backlash over the years. But opinion polls taken in the run-up to this year’s Turkish elections showed that voters believed the slowing economy and Syrian refugees were the country’s main problems.
Mr Erdogan’s party suffered a string of losses in the election, including the mayors’ races in the capital Ankara and in Istanbul, where the new opposition mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, has said Syrians must return home. He claims the city cannot cope with the number of migrants. 
After the vote, Mr Erdogan pledged to reduce Syrians’ healthcare benefits and deport “criminals”. In recent years, Turkey has built hundreds of miles of wall along its border with Syria to deter new arrivals.

More than 500,000 Syrians are registered in Istanbul, and Mr Imamoglu has estimated that the same number are there without permission, drawn by the promise of work. Turkey requires Syrians to remain in the province where they are registered and obtain permits to travel. 
About 300,000 migrants and refugees from other countries also live in Turkey.

For Nejat, a 54-year-old cleaner originally from Damascus now living in Istanbul, the new measures could break up her family. While her children, including a disabled son, are registered in Istanbul, her permit requires her to stay in a town near the border. “I have no one there. Our home would fall apart without its mother,” she said.
On Tuesday, the streets of neighbourhoods where large numbers of Syrians live were largely empty, with residents afraid to venture outside and encounter police checkpoints, a witness said.
Ramazan Secilmis, a senior immigration official, said this month that no Syrians had been able to register in Istanbul since 2016. “Istanbul has reached its capacity, and we have to decrease the pressure on Istanbul,” he told reporters.",,/r/europe/comments/ctc7m2/syrian_migrants_face_expulsion_from_istanbul/exjy5no/,MelodicBerries,1566364538

1138,"Yes, they are. Absolutely every one of the EU top posts is elected in the exact same way that any national government is elected. 

How do national elections work? You have several parties, you pick one, you vote for it, everyone does. Then votes are counted and the top party makes a government. When the top party doesn't have a full majority, they talk with other parties and create a coalition government. Then the top party chooses a prime minister and he appoints ministers. You don't directly vote for the ministers. That would be stupid.

Now change the word prime minister to commission president and the word minister to commissioner and it is EXACTLY THE SAME. People like to scream that the European Commission is UNELECTED, but they have never, not once, directly elected their ministers and see no problem with that.

Not only that, but the other two major bodies of power in the EU - European Parliament and European Council, they both consist entirely of directly elected people. Every single political post in the EU is either directly or indirectly elected.

The annual number of deaths on EU roads has been around 25 000 since 2013, after a steady decline from 43 000 in 2007.

Passenger car deaths accounted for almost half (46%) of all fatal road accidents in 2017, followed by deaths of pedestrians (21%), motorcyclists (15%), bicyclists (8%) and deaths involving other forms of road transport (10%).

In the EU Member States, Bulgaria ranks highest in the passenger car category with 64 deaths per million inhabitants (2016 data), which is almost six times the lowest rate, that of Malta (11, also 2016 data).

The rate of deaths among pedestrians in road traffic accidents is highest in Romania (37 deaths per million inhabitants) and lowest in Denmark (3).

Greece has the highest rate of fatalities in relation to motorcycle accidents (20 deaths per million inhabitants) in 2017. This contrasts with the situation in Bulgaria (2016 data) and Estonia, where the rate is zero.

1264,"The allegations against China concerning Xinjiang/Uighurs should be treated with a bit of skepticism, as media coverage originating from NATO members is often hostile and negative towards China. There is a disturbing pattern of anti-China stories in the western media, a reflection of the increasing anxiety that western regimes have towards China's progress and development. In particular, there was the American-led invasion of Korea in 1950 which included armed attacks against China and occupation of China's Taiwan straits, forcing China to defend herself at the cost of many thousands of lives. Inevitably, mainstream media in the west is going to possess an anti-China bias.

In addition to the information war against China through the mainstream media, western regimes' hostile policies against China include propping up a separatist clique in Taiwan that has prevented the island from properly being integrated into the rest of China. The US illegally smuggles weapons into Taiwan. The CIA's illegal activities in Tibet are amply documented and degrees of interference and subversion area also carried out in Xinjiang

5,000 Islamic extremists from Xinjiang have fought in Syria against Syria's government. Terrorist attacks perpetrated by Islamic extremists in Xinjiang have cruelly murdered large numbers of Chinese people in cold blood. And China has no choice but to defend herself through resolute and categorical procedures including surveillance, more cops on the streets, enhances in technology, increased education, and stamping out Medieval cult-like ideas. Unlike Germany or France, China is going to fight back after being subjected to massacres at the hands of radical Islamic terror, and objective evidence shows that China is succeeding.

HK protesters have stormed government headquarters, beaten up people wearing T-shirts saying they support the HK police, etc. How exactly is that more peaceful than burning cars?

The EUs independent Commission of Venice for freedom and democracy sent a letter to puigdemont, asking him to stop and respect the Spanish law.   
The EUs independent Court of Human rights has supported Spain in *all* of the seven cases about catalonia.   
Palestine strongly supported Madrid. Kosovo went even further and strongly criticised the Catalan govt.  
Literally zero national or regional parliaments or governments recognised Catalan independence, so I guess it's not about western interests.  
Human rights organisations have made it very clear that they have no problems with Spain (at least not in this case, certainly so in others). Amnesty International spoke about ""politicians in prison, not political prisoners"". In general, not a single NGO in the world supports the Catalan nationalists.   
While the majority of the people in HK probably oppose China, or at least ask for democracy and free elections, the Catalan nationalist have never, ever, never got the majority of the popular vote, and only get a majority at the regional Parliament because they are the only of the 17 regions without their own electoral law, because the old, pre-constitutional, pre-democratic law they prefer to use hugely favors the nationalist parties. 

The two cases couldn't be more different...

As for Crimea, the Russian economy has been extremely affected by Western economic sanctions. What else is Europe supposed to do, go to war against a nuclear power?

Honestly, what are we supposed to do here? Military actions is out of the question. An economic war against China would be terrible for our citizens (see Trump) and I don't see how that would benefit the people of HK.

Finally, we have spent years and decades shitting on the USA for meddling in other countries and being the world's police.... And now we are supposed to do exactly that? Can we just stay out of other countries problems, whether it's Venezuela, HK or any other (as long as there is no genocide going on, which is thankfully not the case)?",,/r/europe/comments/ct2bz7/open_letters_from_hong_kong_to_the_people_of/exj6vcv/,GiveMeKarmaAndSTFU,1566343291

1443,"Yes and no. 

If you dance in front of the naked reactor, or inhale highly radioactive dust after the detonation - yes, the absorbed dose (or amount of ingested radioisotopes) will be high and many organs will be affected strongly enough to notice. 

But low-dose radioactive contamination is dangerous mostly if radioisotope gets accumulated and concentrated in some organ. Then the total activity becomes sufficient to cause long-term damage. This is what happens with radioiodine in thyroid. Or strontium in the bones (as it is similar to calcium).

If the cocktail of isotopes is about the same as in Chernobyl, and you get only fallout (not direct exposure to the fuel), then taking iodine is almost enough. The only statistically significant change in cancer incidence after Chernobyl was increase in thyroid cancer in children and teenagers (still growing, so thyroid is highly active).",⚑ the glory of Chaos ⚑,/r/europe/comments/ct1k2t/lithuania_to_buy_iodine_tablets_as_belarus_plans/exj6wsb/,Idiocracy_Cometh,1566343316

As time went on, it seems there was a realization that it wouldn't be as easy as some thought on the British side, and some tried to say they were all for a deal, while their visible internal politics still stoked resentment against the EU.

RDI of [0.8g per kg of body weight](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-protein-per-day) for sedentary people in this article sounds close enough.

r/fitness usually says 1-1.5g/kg but remember that's for active people making sure they always get enough protein. Studies have shown any muscle-building benefits wear off after 2g/kg of body weight.

I'd speculate that the app you're using tailors towards people looking to lose weight through calorie restriction. I see two benefits; (1) Protein will keep you satiated for longer so it helps the journey to eat more protein than the amount you'd need purely to keep your muscles in shape. (2) [This article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22150425) states that high protein consumption allows you to keep building muscle while on a caloric deficit, but only if you're reasonably active otherwise your body will nom nom on muscle regardless.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/csviq8/of_population_that_is_severely_materially_deprived/exigym5/,RassyM,1566328114

1721,"No, you got it all completely wrong. US doesn't owe you anything. **You owe U.S. a lot**. Let me explain how it works. 

First of all, it's not kamikazing, it's simply pulling out and leaving everyone else with the world system with which they can now do what they want, but without US subsidizing it. It will most possibly crash, because there's no one to subsidize it, but at the same time there's no reason why US should be subsidizing it since the fall of USSR if more and more countries want to fuck them.

US itself is one of the most independent economically states in the world. Only 6% of their gdp comes from exports and a big chunk of that is NAFTA and another big chunk of that is latin America. NAFTA with cheap labour in Mexico and growing automation influence can pretty much function for the US like a small version of the current world system. They can leave the world system and face only minor turbulence while the rest of the world, where absolutely nobody is in a position like that goes down straight to hell. 

Why? Because there's no world policeman anymore. There's nobody to guarantee the freedom of sail anymore which keeps the cost of ocean trade extremely low, nobody to intervene when someone wants to break the freedom of sail. Everyone from now must secure it's own transport with it's own navy because US has no reason to continue this shit.

But nobody else has that navy.

But why now? Because US wasn't in the world trade system for income (like you're suggesting) in the first place. It's easy to prove showing just how little US was dependent on world markets all that time. From the very beginning US created the world system in 1944 (and modernized it in the 70's) to bribe countries into getting on US side against the USSR and it's allies. This was a strategy driven only for security reasons. The deal was you're on our side but we sail and secure the trade routes and you can sell your products anywhere you want in the system'. Since then everyone with a port who was in the system could sell it's products to anyone else in the same situation and they did not have to spend tons of money on navy to secure their trade routes. US was spending that money. That was the deal.  It brought a massive GDP growth for the world and this world should thank US for creating this opportunity.

But there's no USSR anymore.

There's no ""One big guy"" superpower to fight with in a binary like situation. Now it's a group of regional powers that can be balanced against each other, the world system strategy doesn't fit here. The biggest of them - China is actually using the US led world system to compete with US. The difference here is that USSR was outside the world system, while China is already in.

There's no reason to participate in this system anymore. US is leaving the system that has created for it's own security reasons but which brought prosperity to the world. That's ending.

1723,"&gt;It worked for others, right?

for WHOM? One simple question, I've been asking you for the last 4 posts. Who are those mysterious and elusive countries, for whom communism ever worked?

&gt;Are you by any chance possessed by McCarthy? 

No, but McCarthy was a great man, and many of the people he outed as commies actually turned to be ones later on. Who knows what would happen to America if not for him - maybe communist agents would actually succesfully infiltrate and hijack the country most staunchly opposing the Soviet imperialism, and I'm afraid to even wonder what kind of a crapsack world we would end up with.

&gt;hahahaha

&gt;You invaded Czechoslovakia with Germany 

We did it without consulting Germany.

&gt;and when Soviets wanted to stop Germany you said you'd sooner help Germany invade Soviet Union then let them stop Germany. 

Soviet Army has this interesting property, that once they enter your country (regardless of whether they were invited or not), your country ceases to exist as an independent actor. Ask Lithuania, Latvia or Estonia.

&gt;Whatever happened to you during ww2 was entirely of your own doing.

&gt;So commies lifted you to the level of countries untouched by war in only few years,

Spain? Greece? ""Untouched by war""? Wonder what other revelations you will come up with.
&gt; yet somehow it was commie fault you failed after? 

Yes, it's commies fault that their joke of an economic system is unable to keep up with capitalist economies.

&gt;Your entire comment reeks of blind emotional hatred. 

My hatred is based on cold, hard facts and data. Yes, I do hate communists for all the evil stuff they did, and for all the harm they did to my country. Never again, and I'm glad to live in a country where communism is banned.

&gt;Economic collapse came after dissolution of USSR.

Economic collapse was a side effect of transition to a different economic system. And thank god it did. Suddenly it turned out, that nobody actually wanted to buy the outdated crap commie countries produced, other than the other commie countries which were forced to do so by the lack of alternatives.

The economies needed to be rearranged from producing useless shit nobody wanted, into producing stuff there actually was a demand for. So yeah, the nominal numbers decreased for a while in the transition period, but once the economic transformation succesfully happened, until a country screwed up the process enormously like Ukraine did, the economies were doing much better than before.

&gt;So why did their economies collapse after USSR got dissolved but were growing before?

????

All those countries stopped being communist *before* the USSR dissolved. Mate, do you even know basic history?

&gt;sigh... too tired for this shit. Its like trying to reason with religious fundamentalist.

Yeah, dealing with commie apologists really feels no different than with religious fanatics.

I have never said healthcare is a right, nor are rights and services mutually exclusive - you have a right to a lawyer for example.

The US government spends more per person on healthcare already than many countries with universal coverage. Switching to a single payer universal system enables the kind of negotiating clout that will bring costs down and reduce the deficit, just as it has in other countries. The benefit of being last to the universal coverage party is that all the best ways to get it done have already been tested. If we want to reduce the deficit, we should be bringing down healthcare costs through universal coverage, which will lead to less spending per person.

 An Italian speaker who learns English goes from being able to speak to around 70 million people to around 1.2 billion. (A 1700% increase)

An English speaker learning mandarin gets just under 100%. Learning Italian would get less than 6%.

So for an English speaker to get the same return on their time invested learning Italian as an Italian gets for learning English, they would need to be able to learn it to basic fluency in around 17 minutes. (Based on it taking 480 hours to learn a language to basic fluency).",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/csw4ok/brexit_blues_psychologists_report_on_an/exhtoo5/,Rulweylan,1566313881

I'm the lucky one, I got my house - but it took me 25+ years to get there (not counting my childhood) mortgage free and all so the coming financial catastrophic we're heading for won't affect me so much - at best I'll be an redundant IT supporter at the world wide company I work for (they're in no way saying that), but you if you know anything about today's situation - a guaranteed job isn't a thing you keep for 10+ and take for granted anymore.

And I feel for our young people today, I had many years as a substitute teacher before I couldn't handle todays pressure for teachers anymore and caved in an took a job in the private sector again, but I learned so much from the kids - they're REALLY worried about the future, and I understand why - it's pure hell out there for them today. For most of them, home ownership is a pipe dream, and their parents are struggling with two jobs just to get ends to meet. 

I talked to my manager, he's way above my paygrade - but even he worries about the situation, we got wasted together one day, and he opened up to me and told me his situation, not a fun story at all, they struggle so hard, he works overtime ALL the time to pay for his kids life to be decent and he's literally got brown rings around his eyes from lack of sleep.",,/r/europe/comments/csdygp/finnish_social_minister_europe_needs_a_paradigm/exhjrmq/,JoOngle,1566306971

1949,"&gt;Where did I say stop doing that? I said constantly focusing on that is not productive.

Where did I say that it is forbidden to do or say anything else? Shitheads say shitty racist things, racist things get denounced, move on. But we can't not denounce it or it will be normalized.

&gt;Because a different immigration policy is of course totally the same as the Holocaust... Stop making these ridiculous jumps, it's get tiring and it honestly achieving the opposite effect.

You're actually having the opposite effect by minimizing everything that is not exactly as bad as the holocaust. The holocaust wasn't put forward for approval during elections, the holocaust policies wer implemented step by step.

&gt;Which is my point since the beginning in this discussion, yet you continue to do the same thing over and over again. It doesn't work, it has never worked and it will never work. So adapt if you want to change things.

It's working fine to prevent casual racism from becoming ordinary and accepted, so what's the problem?

&gt;They might very well be in favor of 90% of your goals and disagree with a lot of stuff the far right party they vote for says. So you need to see how you can win them back with that. 

If they can't handle that racist practices are called racist, then they can stay in the time-out corner for a while longer AFAIAC.

&gt;You want to reach the one that sees their lives becoming worse and has shifted towards the far right since he is giving a way out there. And you need to offer them a new and better way instead.

And how does is that hindered by calling out racism for what it is?

In fact, there are plenty of people whose lives are actively made worse by racism, so we would be letting those down by not calling out racism as unacceptable.

&gt;When did convincing voters to come to your political side become a bad thing? When did the idea come up that people are just lost causes then and can't be convinced, changed or won over? Because if you think that, you are no better then the ones on the far right saying that all foreigners are terrorists and criminals, talking about people like they are all the same, that there are no circumstances leading to their issues and there is no way to change that. Are you seriously advocating here to just give up and do nothing, and then somehow magically expect the far right parties to disappear again?

What is your alternative? Accepting racist drivel as the new normal so as not to offend far right voters, and offer them free beer? Actively advocate racist policies to appeal to the racist ideas that are common, so as to convince those voters? You seem to have the idea that people just aimlessly wander around and happen to vote for far right parties because the others have fallen asleep, but people vote for the extreme right because they want to vote for racist policies, and that is caused by, among other things, the racist bullshit doing the rounds, so we should keep calling it out for what it is.

Unless you have a solid idea what obvious idea is lacking in the programs of the left that would make all the people who vote racist suddenly forget about their racist feelings, you really don't have anything else to offer.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/bwa8ee/we_already_tried/exhjsj7/,silverionmox,1566306990

1961,"&gt; After fighting in WWI &amp; WWII &amp; the Cold War and since, (Balkens etc), yes the US very much has an interest in keeping Europe secure. 

That really doesn't follow. The US has reasons to care, like access to European export and import and using the European military and logistical capacity, but not what you said.

&gt; Also most of the wars in Europe have been started by countries in Europe so no it is not an automatic assumption that all European nations are on the same page. 

Yes but that was before WW2. Now EU nations largely are, and non-EU countries are either Russia or not very relevant.

&gt; ""but now they can"" Why? Could Ukraine trust Russia? Does everyone trust Serbia? Do the Greeks and Turks trust each other? Ireland &amp; Northern Ireland? Basques? There are still plenty of differences of opinion. 

Note that you always cite either a non-EU country or an intra-national issue. These trust issues don't really exist within the EU, at least in the core of it (especially when we stop counting the UK), and certainly not between the most important members, Germany and France, who previously caused a lot of the wars in Europe that no longer exist.

2010,"It is very much the same

People are the same. The difference is the language, but minuscule at that. Vulgar latin sounds almost identical to italian. Speaking Latin as it was spoken in the day, it sounds Italian, give or take the accentuation. It doesn’t sound french or spanish more than it sounds Italian

Also, people of a region don’t change without massive displacement of people.

The people of Rome fled to Venice, Florens and other citystates over time but all stayed within present-day Italy.

In order for a people to completely change due to migration/interbreding, whatnot, you need historical levels of mass migration. Had such events taken place, we’d known about it. The effects of the mass migration of the late roman empire mainly caused pockets of other peoples in Iberia and other places, it wasn’t enough to completely ”change the people of the Italian peninsula”

For example - when an invading army comes in, like the Lombards, usually these are a small minority ruling over the peasants. These people **never** have more babies than all the plebs combined. The fertility rate of the minority migrant is never as high as the inhabitants of the region, if it were, such an event would be very well documented

Not even the Turks managed to change the people of Anatolia. The majority all still look greek. More greek than Turkic. The same goes for Italy. These are the same people. No tectonic event took place to completely alter the genepool of the peninsula forever.

(note that while gender dysphoria is a mental disorder it is not the same thing as gender nonconformity, and also that current hormone treatment and gender reassignment procedures are backed by studies that demonstrate their positive effect on a person's mental well being and the ineffectiveness of other methods). 

Essentially this means that the majority of anti-lgbt arguments based on mental and health issues, which are some of the most common, do not accurately match the current scientific understanding.

2218,"""The very meaninglessness of life forces man to create his own meaning. Children, of course, begin life with an untarnished sense of wonder, a capacity to experience total joy at something as simple as the greenness of a leaf; but as they grow older, the awareness of death and decay begins to impinge on their consciousness and subtly erode their joie de vivre, their idealism — and their assumption of immortality. As a child matures, he sees death and pain everywhere about him, and begins to lose faith in the ultimate goodness of man. But, if he’s reasonably strong — and lucky — he can emerge from this twilight of the soul into a rebirth of life’s elan. Both because of and in spite of his awareness of the meaninglessness of life, he can forge a fresh sense of purpose and affirmation. He may not recapture the same pure sense of wonder he was born with, but he can shape something far more enduring and sustaining. The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile but that it is indifferent; but if we can come to terms with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the boundaries of death — however mutable man may be able to make them — our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and fulfillment. **However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.**""

If we take an qualified labor in US - company offers very good health insurance coverage by contract already. Of course, for low-qualified labor EU is better because they are covered anyway.

Regarding education - you are right, but I pay for MY education if I want to, and not for somebody's else. Just a different mindset.

&gt; Overall, the difference is not mind-blowingly large, as it used to be - Europe used to be much poorer.

For IT / doctors / engineering difference is quite large, because this sector is underpayed and ""overtaxed"" in EU compared to US, and chances that you end up in your 60s without own house / flat are quite a bit higher in EU.

Also, in US you have bonus pension funds, and may end up with much higher pension than in EU.

Why would you expect otherwise, though? Take a look around at most people. Their jobs, which is what they spend most of their time on during the day, is utterly meaningless and boring. Nobody dreams of becoming a cab driber, a cashier, or an office drone.

What we need to ask is why Keynes prediction about very short work weeks didn't come true, because productivity would be so high that we could work far less and have much more leisure time. I think that is the root of a lot of this. That's also why people do drugs and get drunk on weekends, to numb the pain they feel during work.

If Nazis developed something effective, if they solved some issues with surgery, rocketry or whatever than we should obviously take full advantage of that.

Reparations: Why Poland is now demanding 850 billion

Shortly before the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of the war in 1939, Poland is replenished in the dispute over reparations. In comparison with France, it had been treated ""unfairly"" after the war. If the federal government would respond - the consequences could hardly be estimated.
A few days before the 80th anniversary of the attack of Hitler's Germany on Poland, the demands for reparations are boiling once again. Arkadiusz Mularczyk, the chairman of an appropriate commission, demands the sum of 850 billion euros in a still unpublished report, can be heard in Warsaw. The paper is to be published on 1 September.

In March 2018, Mularczyk, a member of the right-wing populist Polish governing party Law and Justice (PiS) and a well-known hardliner, demanded 690 billion euros.

Poland's Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz (also PiS) expressed himself only slightly more moderately than the hardliner Mularczyk. ""There are countries that have lost many times less, but received more compensation. Is that all right,"" he asked: ""The central question is whether Poland has been treated fairly in comparison to other countries."" He explicitly mentioned France and the Netherlands.

Polish supporters of reparations claims claim that Poland, relative to its size, suffered the greatest number of victims in the Second World War. The number of deaths per 1000 inhabitants is between 200 and 230 - an order of magnitude that would be approximately correct if all the victims were included, including Polish Jews, ethnic Belarusians and Ukrainians on Polish territory at the time. Furthermore, the almost complete destruction of Polish cities such as Warsaw is mentioned. Material damage is said to be a calculable quantity.


In reality, the reasons for this discussion lie in Polish domestic politics. The PiS is encouraging anti-German prejudices with its ever-increasing demands, which will certainly soon exceed a trillion euros.

The government in Warsaw knows that it cannot achieve anything by legal means. In mid-January 2018 Foreign Minister Czaputowicz said of the demand for reparations from Germany: ""We are certainly not striving for this question to burden our cooperation. It became even clearer: ""This issue does not exist in the relations between our governments"".

There is no basis in international law for Polish reparations claims against Germany. There are several reasons for this: The Potsdam Agreement of 1945 already stipulated that Poland's claims against the Soviet Union arising from Germany's payments should be settled. Furthermore, on 23 August 1953 the government in Warsaw bindingly waived further demands. In 1960, the Federal Government concluded global agreements with France and the Netherlands, in which payments in excess of 400 and 125 million German marks respectively were fixed.

Poland's current PiS government disputes the validity of the 1945 and 1953 treaties because no freely elected Polish government was involved. However, this does not affect the validity of treaties under international law.

In addition, even democratically legitimised Polish governments have effectively agreed to the renunciation of reparations. On the one hand, the Charter of Paris of 21 November 1990, signed by the Warsaw government, put an end to the Cold War and the bloc confrontation in Europe and replaced it with the goal of peaceful cooperation.

The Charter of Paris also regulated the recognition of the reunification of the two German states. The victorious powers of the Second World War had negotiated the terms of the Two-Plus-Four Treaty of 1990 - including the implicit renunciation of any form of reparation.

The relevant section of the Charter of Paris states: ""We note with great satisfaction the agreement signed in Moscow on 12 September 1990 on the final settlement with regard to Germany and sincerely welcome the fact that the German people have united in one state in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and in full agreement with their neighbours"".

Furthermore, a border treaty and a neighbourhood treaty were concluded between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland in 1990/1991. In the latter, an agreement was reached on a settlement of outstanding compensation issues, whereupon the equivalent of 1.3 billion euros flowed from Bonn to the east.

The repetitions of the legally unsustainable demands from Poland aim to build up moral and political pressure. Should Poland make concessions to the German government, similar behaviour towards Greece would probably be inevitable. There, too, politicians are outbidding each other with ever-increasing demands on Germany to the tune of billions - most recently around 270 to 300 billion euros.

Assuming that other countries, which have long since had international treaties on reparations, would now make demands, high trillions could come together - which could become a serious burden for the German economy.

After all, the entire reorganisation of Europe after the Second World War would be called into question. If the repeated renunciation of reparations by Polish governments is not to apply - on what grounds would Poland's shift to the West to German territories such as East Prussia and Silesia unquestionably still exist for centuries, and vice versa the shift to the West by Belarus and Ukraine?

The course taken by the right-wing conservative government in Warsaw is reminiscent of the time between the world wars. It calls into question the European cooperation of the past 70 years in the West and almost 30 years in the East. The consequences are well known.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/css97t/reparations_why_poland_is_now_demanding_850/exgrcog/,idigporkfat,1566272253

2442,"What a good source, ""iammyownreporter.com"", a guy who claims to have been on vacation there more than once. 

Here are some of his sources to disprove the ""myths"": ""Americans are brainwashed! Almost everyone is brainwashed, and the slickest, most pervasive, most relentless brainwashing machine
in the world is the U.S. mass media. The U.S. brainwashing machine invented the term ""brainwashing"" to express ""our"" disapproval of communist ""regimes"" having the audacity to teach people that their system is the good one and ours the evil one."" 

""This is a lie spread by Miami."" 

But according to Human Rights Watch ""The Cuban government continues to repress and punish dissent and public criticism. The number of short-term arbitrary arrests of human rights defenders, independent journalists, and others was significantly less in 2018 than in 2017, but still remained high, with more than 2,000 reports of arbitrary detentions between January and August. The government continues to use other repressive tactics, including beatings, public shaming, travel restrictions, and termination of employment against critics. 
The government controls virtually all media outlets in Cuba and restricts access to outside information. A small number of independent journalists and bloggers manage to write articles for websites or blogs, or publish tweets. The government routinely blocks access within Cuba to these websites, and only a fraction of Cubans can read independent websites and blogs because of the high cost of, and limited access to, the internet. 
Independent journalists who publish information considered critical of the government are subject to harassment, smear campaigns, raids on their homes and offices, confiscation of their working materials, and arbitrary arrests. The journalists are held incommunicado, as are artists and academics who demand greater freedoms. Desacato laws continue to be enforced against opponents."" 

Amnesty says this: ""Arbitrary detentions, discriminatory dismissals from state jobs, and harassment in self-employment continued to be used to silence criticism. Advances in education were undermined by ongoing online and offline censorship. Cuba remained mostly closed to independent human rights monitors. At least 12 lawyers from the human rights organization Cubalex received asylum in the USA after being harassed, intimidated and threatened with imprisonment for their peaceful human rights work. Human rights and political activists continued to be harassed, intimidated and arbitrarily detained in high numbers. The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, a Cuban NGO not officially recognized by the state, recorded 5,155 arbitrary detentions in 2017, compared to 9,940 in 2016.

The Ladies in White, a group of female relatives of prisoners detained on politically motivated grounds, remained one of the primary targets of repression by the authorities. During detention, the women were often beaten by law enforcement officials and state security agents dressed as civilians."" 

This is strange, because your anonymous blogger and tourist clearly states that according to both of these organisations Cuba is not only as free as any other western nation but actually MORE free than USA. A quick look at their websites showed your tourist was lying on his blog where he doesn't use sources other than ""I have been everywhere and it's obvious that Cuba is the freest, everything else is lies from Miami"". 

Also, Reporters without borders claims Cuba is the fifth least free nation for media and press, worse than China but just above North Korea.

2484,"&gt; The AfD only scores so high in those low populated East German states

Saxony is more densely populated than Bavaria...

&gt; They are all states with only four votes in the council. 

MVP has 3 but I don't get your point. Eastern Germany doesn't matter? or what are you trying to say?

&gt; Here where I live the AfD scores at 3% where as the Greens got more then 42% in the last two elections (Bavaria &amp; Europe).

Such a voting district does virtually not exist. If you go down to communal level where I live they got literally 0 % last year but I still don't get what you are trying to suggest by this. Like any party the AfD has their ""Hochburgen"" and other areas where they are not appreciated and there are also areas in western Germany where they do or did rather well, one of them is Eastern Bavaria where they scored close to 20 % in the last federal election in 2 or 3 districts (they had a really strong performance in Deggendorf if memory serves), the poor cities in the Ruhr area have the same, as do parts of BaWü and RP. They do score above 5 % in almost all voting districts. In the last federal election the only one below 5 % was Münster. This suggests that for the meantime they're here to stay. It's wrong to suggest that it's only an East German problem. It's also wrong to suggest that they are widlly succesfull (which some other people sometimes do). 13-14 % is at best middle down the road for such a party in Europe today.",For a Europe of the Regions!,/r/europe/comments/csfrq9/germany_brandenburg_regional_election/exguhqm/,tobias_681,1566275752

2602,"&gt; Yea, social construct totally isn't a word near exclusively used by ideologues, lol.

No, it isn't. It's just a statement of facts. 

Laws or customs aren't principles of nature or fundamental forces. We didn't discover them. They didn't fall out of the sky. We didn't dig them out of the ground. Nobody handed them down from above. *Humans* made them up either by consent (laws), practise (customs), or both, because their *nature* is to *be social*.

Norms aren't absolutes - which is why we can consciously chose to ignore them (and get punished afterwards, because we're responsible for the choices we've made). They're not eternal, which is why they will change whenever people think they should. 

&gt; By people who think people are born as blank slates

That's a *non sequitur*. You don't have to believe that humans are a ""blank slate"" to find that their norms are social constructs, i.e. things made up *by* and *for* them.

Now, I do not condone such violence, but this is all about your future god damnit. By now the populace of Britain who wishes remain in the EU may not have an absolute majority (due to neutral opinions being counted as a separate group), but it still outmatches the Leavers by roughly 7 percent. The Leavers were only able to attain the absolute majority in referendum due to the neutrals not having any representation in the binary nature of the flawed referendum. I would be fucking livid. And making it known through actions. Just look at the Hong Kong situation at the moment. Millons of people are demonstrating for their shared belief that the PRC's influence on your ex-colony has to be kept at its current state. What outcome do you think will a hard Brexit as strived for by your PM Johnson have on your negotiating position against such economic giants as autocratic China and corporatist America? I, for once, don't see any positives for the general British public in terms of wealth, social security and ironically even freedom if a hard brexit comes to pass and the neorealist powers are able to dictate their terms onto the UK.

As flawed as the EU may be, it is still your best option of preserving your status as a true 'sovereign' state within the international arena.

2647,"&gt; Laws or customs aren't principles of nature or fundamental forces.

Yes and no. Every pack animal has clear internal rules and way for the pack for to keep behaving a certain way. Human societies are obviously more complex than packs of wolves or families of chimps, and we're much more numerous which is why we started writing down our rules instead and devising systems of implementing them rather than just rely on unspoken expectations and the wants of the pack alpha.

&gt; Humans made them up either by consent (laws), practise (customs), or both, because their nature is to be social.

Exactly, they're a natural consequence of being a social animal. Funny you use ""their nature"" in reference to humans yourself now. Are you an ideologue? I agree on most norms being flexible over time, though I believe some are near-universal.

&gt; Or do you really believe that humanity didn't know that deliberately putting other people to death (i.e. murder) was a bad thing until someone somewhere made a law about it? I daresay that humanity wouldn't have made it up to this point if they didn't know that.

Depends who was murdered honestly. Murder of an accepted in-group members has always been unacceptable, but regarding out-group members I do not believe that to be the case at all. That mostly depends on how secure that society is feeling: i.e more empathy in certain times, less in uncertain times. If only we could ask the North Sentinelese why they kill anyone that lands and whether they feel it's bad?

Moral dilemmas have plagued us since ancient times. Human nature is just a nature of extremes anyway: we are capable of unique levels of empathy, but also unique levels of cruelty.

2652,"I am no apologist for the USA. I will say right up front that the current state of affairs is looking like blustery fascism with a chance of civil unrest and scattered economic disaster. The Trumo admin is violating international laws and US laws while contributing to a humanitarian disaster.

Let's talk about cultural arrogance for the moment. We can look at how empires have forcefully colonized other lands, subjugated them with violence and oppression perpetuated with rqcism. then after the people get independence and the right to travel and move to the country that colonized them, the colonizing country is appalled that the unbearable conditions they created are not desired and all these brown people speaking other languages start showing up to get a better life. 

That's right. Because the powerful nations of the world are permitted to conquer and violate other less powerful nations and people, but the people who have been under such rule are not permitted to reside within the country that subjugated it.

Platforms in both the US and in Britain have been mostly based on racism and some sense of entitlement. Everything I saw in Britain (and yes i was there for a while) from the mid 90s until now, regarding the EU, was framed as an immigration issue. Norway, though, with their ""Nei til EU"" signs was based on things like economics and sovereignty over resources.

For both the US and Britain they want all the benefits and none of the responsibilities and consequences. The US economy would not operate without migrant labor, but we can't have them living here and going to school. Britain wants to be the financial center of the world with all sorts of privilege within the EU, but does not want to share any of the burden.

I am not arrogant. I am angry.

PYD and ISIS are not equal threats, lets be real now, ISIS is not a threat for Turkey. If they were, [this safe zone they proposed would look different](https://twitter.com/zana_med/status/1162464812162592768?s=20).

The whole idea that the PYD are related to the PKK and thus is justification of your accusations is a complete lie.

The police, as any gilet jaune will tell you, are urged to report every scratch, bruise and even the temporary deafness brought on by the sound of their own munitions.
“We are never offered a detailed breakdown of the seriousness of police injuries,” Dufresne tells me. “What is certain is that no officer has lost an eye or a limb. If they had, Castaner would have paraded them in front of the media as a matter of urgency.”

People would rather pay extra for a good location (which is what happens right now), than get stuck in a shit place with no way to get out. *Implying* that people would actually manage to enforce that idea and the housing wouldn't just evolve into a huge black market, where you get to pay just as much as currently for a decent place to live, and the government doesn't see a dime from such transactions.",Silesia (Poland),/r/europe/comments/csdygp/finnish_social_minister_europe_needs_a_paradigm/exfkduf/,Piro42,1566242483

&gt;So according to you the members of the IRA were all savage terrorist murderers while the British army just had a few bad soldiers who committed crimes?

No. Who said this? Who are you arguing with? I said that many savage terrorist murders were let out as a result of the GFA.

What are you disagreeing with?



&gt;The British Army and police force in Northern Ireland committed acts of terror against the general public and are as deserving of the title terrorist just as much as the IRA or UVF.

Zzzzz. Nice b8 m8. The numbers disagree but this has nothing to do with the topic at all so we'll carry on.



&gt;Amnesty was granted to the prisoners linked to paramilitary groups in order to bring peace and a conclusion to the Troubles because there was no way to rectify or give justice to the apartheid state that the British had created in Northern Ireland. The amnesty was never intended to be used for trigger happy British soldiers who showed up and started murdering innocent people.

No I know that you fucking idiot I literally said it in the last post. The amnesty did not grant soldiers freedom or immunity. That's correct. Yes. I agree. It's been said 4 times.

3050,"Two Russian monitoring stations designed to detect nuclear radiation went silent soon after the explosion at a missile test site this month, spurring concerns among observers that the Russian government is trying to restrict evidence of the accident.

Two days after the explosion of a suspected nuclear-powered cruise missile undergoing testing Aug. 8, two monitoring stations nearest the site of the accident stopped transmitting data, Lassina Zerbo, who heads the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, told The Wall Street Journal.

The Russian monitoring stations, called Dubna and Kirov after the places where they are located, were contacted immediately about the data disruption, Mr. Zerbo wrote in an email Sunday to the Journal, and Russian officials responded that they were experiencing “communication &amp; network issues.”

“We are pending further reports on when the stations or the communication system will be restored to full functionality,” Mr. Zerbo added. He declined to speculate on what caused the outage.

The missile test, on a platform in Dvinsk Bay on the White Sea in northwest Russia, has been the subject of considerable speculation. President Trump has said it involved an advanced nuclear-powered cruise missile, which has been dubbed Skyfall by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and which Russia calls Burevestnik.

The manned monitoring stations are part of an international network of hundreds of stations set up to verify compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which prohibits nuclear weapons tests globally. Participating nations are responsible for running the stations.

The treaty has yet to formally go into effect since the required number of nations have yet to ratify it.

Russia has said it is strictly observing the accord. Numerous monitoring stations have been set up in Russia, and those stations share information with the international organization that oversees the treaty, as well as with nations that have signed the accord, including the U.S.

The stations are designed to monitor everything from seismic shifts to sound waves for signs of nuclear activity. The two stations that went silent in Russia are designed to measure radioactive particles in the atmosphere, according to the treaty organization’s website.

Arms-control experts said the monitoring problem appears to be a Russian effort to conceal information about the accident and not an effort to hide evidence of a prohibited nuclear weapons test.

“It is a very odd coincidence that these stations stopped sending data shortly after the Aug. 8 incident,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a nongovernmental organization promoting arms-control policies.

“It is probably because they want to obscure the technical details of the missile-propulsion system they are trying and failing to develop,” Mr. Kimball said. “But this is not a legitimate reason to cut off test-ban monitoring data transmissions.”

Russian officials in Moscow and at the nation’s embassy in Washington didn’t respond to requests for comment.

As executive director of the Vienna-based test-ban organization, Mr. Zerbo has sought to build support for the accord, which has been signed by 184 nations and ratified by 168 of them. Mr. Zerbo noted that while monitoring stations in the global network have sometimes had problems with power or communications, the network, including Russian stations, has generally provided “great data availability.”

“Before knowing the final cause of this particular outage, we cannot link it to [problems that led to] any previous cases,” Mr. Zerbo added.

The episode has important implications for arms control, which is approaching a critical juncture. After the demise of the U.S.-Russian treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces and a debate in Washington over whether to extend a parallel accord that limits U.S. and Russian long-range nuclear arms, some arms-control proponents say the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty may be the last cornerstone of the traditional arms-control order and so must be maintained.

The U.S. signed the treaty during the Clinton administration. While the Senate hasn’t approved the accord, the U.S. hasn’t conducted a nuclear test since 1992.

The sudden silence of the Russian monitoring stations is likely to be seized on by conservative critics of arms control, who have complained that the Russians can’t be trusted.

In a March letter to the White House, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and several other Republican lawmakers asked Mr. Trump to consider removing the U.S. signature from the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

Arms-control advocates like Mr. Kimball, however, said the episode shows that the global monitoring system—which has provided information on North Korea’s nuclear tests—has proved useful and that the U.S. should strengthen it by ratifying the accord and urging other nations to follow suit.

The organization Mr. Zerbo heads has said that other seismic and infrasound stations in the organization’s network picked up evidence of the Aug. 8 explosion.

The disclosure about the Russian monitoring stations comes on the heels of a debate over whether Russia is strictly adhering to the test-ban treaty.

Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said in May that Russia was likely violating the treaty by secretly carrying out nuclear tests with very low explosive power.

The following month, Gen. Ashley amplified that accusation by stating that the entire U.S. intelligence community has assessed that Russia has conducted small tests that have “created nuclear yield.”

Russia has denied the accusation and complained that the Trump administration is looking for an excuse to formally withdraw from the accord.

The missile that was being tested during the accident is believed to be part of a Russian effort to circumvent U.S. missile defenses, should Washington ever build a nationwide defense system.

At least seven employees of Rosatom, Russia’s atomic energy monopoly, and its Defense Ministry were killed in the accident, Russia has said.",,/r/europe/comments/csife4/russian_nuclear_monitoring_stations_went_silent/exexj2o/,vermeshel,1566227747

3147,"I see you are from an alternate dimension.

Your actual enemies, the people you attacked and wish to attack even today did not participate in colonialism in America. 

You are smart to mention modern Greece. But before the Turks came the Greeks did not only live in modern day Greece they lived in Anatolia and of course in Thrace. How many indeed live there today? How many Christians in Anatolia ? How many desecrations of Christian churches including Aghia Sophia ? 

It's better of you to speak of Spain and Morocco than the actual land you cleansed. 

&gt;And when it comes to Balkan Wars you don’t know anything about history. Population exchange was a thing after Greece’s failed invasion of Turkey in 1920s. Turks of the Balkans, Rhodes, Crete and Morea was already wiped out back then.

In the 18th century :) ?
The original population of the Balkans were not Muslim (just like Anatolia) and certainly not Turkish. After the Ottoman Empire occupied the territories some converted and some invaders settled in the Balkans. Still the ethno-religious cleansing was not as successful as in Anatolia. There were few Muslims to be genocided in the Balkans, most of the people mentioned by Turkish propaganda actually left in the population exchange. 

&gt;And Turks of the Cyprus were at the brink of the extinction in 1970s. It’s funny that you accuse us stealing land when it was only decades ago u tried to annex Cyprus. You are real hypocrites and you are fully aware of it. But you know your hatred towards us is greater than your reasoning.

The coup failed. The Turkish Cypriots were thus not in the brink of extinction. 

The Greeks have been living in Cyprus for at least a thousand years before the Turks. Only a Turk could represent the Greek Cypriot's majority wanting to unite with Greece as stealing. 

Of course you proceeded to move in settlers to put a spanner in any civilized solution of the situation. Them having to leave peacefully back to Turkey would be genocide in your mind.


All in all there's one simple historical fact you have to acknowledge:

The Turks were invaders in the territory of the Ottoman Empire. They assimilated some of the local people in their religion and culture, mainly in Anatolia. They treated those who did not assimilate horribly even if there were some periods of *relative* calm. Even if educated people of those minorities were useful to the administration of the Empire.

This is why you are hated on the Balkans, and why without the Ottoman Empire to keep enforcing local population your people left the Balkans. They were not genocided like the Armenians or Greeks in Anatolia.

 There were small scale massacres during the various revolutionary wars just like there were massacres performed by the Turks during those same wars to frighten the revolutionaries into submission.",,/r/europe/comments/crjocg/turkish_surveillance_aircraft_enter_greek_airspace/exen5p8/,PPN13,1566220445

3157,"The US suppressed its small socialist left during the Cold War, and social studies education in the US for much of the past century was rooted in the supposed fundamental correctness of the American way as opposed to the “Communist” system. This relatively poor level of education in political theory, incidentally, is why you see the words socialism, communism, etc so frequently conflated and misused by many Americans. 

In more recent history, the lurch rightward of the Republican Party began in 1964 with Barry Goldwater’s presidential campaign. This process was slow but culminated in the Reagan revolution in the 1980s. A big part of this process was engaging the Evangelical Christian right in politics—previously this group was politically inactive, but a concerted effort was made to co-opt their support by the US right through the adoption of their socially conservative views into the Republican mainstream—the US’s first-past-the-post electoral system incentivizes forming the broadest party possible and previously this group was seen to be outside normal political life. Bill Clinton then pulled the Democratic Party rightward in order to beat Reagan’s successor, George H.W. Bush, ending up around the centre-left where it mostly sat until quite recently. I remember reading one study from the mid to late-00s which compared US and UK political party platforms. It found that the Democratic Party aligned most closely with the UK Conservatives and the Republican Party with the then-marginal UKIP. 

There are some signs that this political alignment is coming under challenge now. An energized young progressive left is pushing policies that, while they main sound mainstream to a European looking in, are entirely outside the traditional spectrum of modern American politics. The energy of this movement, driven by an economy that is not working for young people, shot figures like Bernie Sanders, who spent most of his career an absolutely marginal figure in US political life, to national prominence. This progressive coalition is pushing dynamic ideas like the green new deal, socialized medecine, free university education, etc. But they are quite new in US politics and it is not at all clear what kind of staying power this group will have—America has a great track record of breaking organized left coalitions and marginalizing their ideas.",Paris 10eme | US Expat,/r/europe/comments/csdygp/finnish_social_minister_europe_needs_a_paradigm/exena8w/,Gwenavere,1566220542

3199,"I studied International Management, but this isnt a very easy question.

Basically when UK have a No-Deal-Brexit they fall back on WTO rules. But there isnt a part how you manage your borders. It is totally up to the single states what they will do on their border, if they make controls or not. But, here is already a restriction, there are other agreements, than the followed one, which will make rules for example for bringing money over the border to fight illegal money.

Anyway ... One of the most important treaties, which is part of the WTO, is the GATT Agreement (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). This agreement is the one, which BoJo is often reffering to, although he did only read the parts he like. 

A basic of this treaty is the ""most-favoured nation clause"" - which pretty simply means, you cant treat a nation worse than another. Every nation has the same access to a market, with the most-favoured terms. So if UK decide to dont make customs controls or raise tariffs on EU products, they are allowed to. But every other nation of the WTO get the same. So chinese or american products for example, are also not allowed for custom controls or tariffs.

You are only allowed to differ from this rules if there is a free trade agreement for this. A further reaching version of this is a customs union or a single market, which also get mentioned in the GATT. If you have a treaty you can put different regulations on different nations. 

So to put it simple ... I think it is indeed possible to not make custom controls for the UK or raise tariffs for EU products. But this would apply to pretty every nation on this planet.

A break of this rules ... well, the WTO isnt working very fast, but surely there would instant lawsuits brought up. But every nation is allowed if they suspect a violation of the WTO rules to put punitive tariffs on a countries products. For an export orientated nation like the UK would this surely be the end.",,/r/europe/comments/csckha/uk_government_furious_at_leak_of_paper_predicting/exenqcl/,Rochhardo,1566220870

3210,"&gt;I don't think the CNT strike (with armed milicies) can be compared with a civil war.

Obviously the impact was not the same, but that wasn't the point of me mentioning it: it was to show the highly unstable nature of the ""democracy"" in the 30s and that had they succeeded in this coup, the left would've been the ""aggressors"" and the right the ""democrats/loyalists"". Even so, if you don't agree with my assessment, lets see what the Socialist leader Largo Caballero said about the same 1936 elections the Fascists revolted against:

«Quiero decirles a las derechas que si triunfamos colaboraremos con nuestros aliados; pero si triunfan las derechas nuestra labor habrá de ser doble, colaborar con nuestros aliados dentro de la legalidad, pero tendremos que ir a la Guerra Civil declarada. Que no digan que nosotros decimos las cosas por decirlas, que nosotros lo realizamos». (El Liberal, de Bilbao, 20 de enero de 1936).

So, I get back to my earlier point that people ""try to make it seem like Republicans were angels when that could not be further from the truth.""


&gt;Before 1959 Spain was an underdeveloped country, high illiterate rates, poverty...

And you think that was somehow caused by Franco? Spain's illiteracy had been way above the European average for literal centuries, we'd been left behind by the Enlightenment due to the many changes in government we'd had through the 18th and 19th centuries.

Poverty had also been a historically Spanish thing since we pissed away the silver coming from the Americas with a multitude of inept rulers who wasted their money on useless campaigns in central Europe and indebted the state for the sake of their own vanity.

&gt;Church was in Franco's side, they weren't civils. 

So supporting one side means the other side is justified in butchering and terrorising them? That must mean you're okay with the Nationalist side's crimes since they were only killing republicans, right?



&gt;&gt;By the end of the Civil War the largest support for the Loyalists came from the USSR, and I don't think anybody is going to try to deny what happened under their regime.

&gt;And who helped the others?

I am aware Nazis and Fascists in Italy supported Franco's cause, that's besides the point though. I was replying to OP's statement that people under Franco's regime starved to death and were enslaved. My pointing out that the Loyalist's support came from the USSR was that, if they had won, under the leadership of people like Enrique Líster, a communist commander trained in the USSR, and the Fifth Regiment, it would most likely have led to a soviet-like regime, thus my pointing out the death-toll, slavery, and famine under soviet rule, which was much greater than under any Fascist dictatorship.


&gt;The thing is unlike republicans, the rebels were who maintained the dictatorship for 40 years, so it is expectable that people remeber more vividly those years than the civil war. But also, due to have relatively good years and the end of it there is people that say life was better back then, which overall is totally false.

Again, I don't disagree, but that doesn't detract from my point that people trying to make the Loyalists seem like angels who were only defending themselves from the devil Fascists are also ""overall totally false."" This gets back to my original comment replying to the fact that centre-right parties like PP and Cs trying to make it so that in education we learn that ""both sides were bad"" is the way to go, since that is actually the truth (and notice I didn't say both sides were *equally* bad, just that neither of them were *good*).",,/r/europe/comments/cryrji/on_this_day_83_years_ago_the_great_spanish_poet/exef7fv/,Erryuio,1566212915

I do not mind funds from Riga going to Latgale - why could it not be on the European level as well? Why think of such nationalistic forms, if the distance from Riga to Estonia is closer than Latgale, and from Berlin to West Poland is closer than Berlin or Munich? Countries are just European regions, we're all in the same economic pot here.

Plus - proper Eastern and Western, Northern and Southern cohesion - would absolutely help poorer Western Europeans as well, as it would help them compete for better opportunities (due to reduced Easteuropean worker flows), and established EU-wide social housing (just as an example) could easily be applied to more rich Western countries as well. 

&gt; let the states that aren't doing as well actually change to do the things that foster economic prosperity. 

This implies that the groups that need this help will benefit from simple economic prosperity. There are millions of people who are out of work in the EU and cannot work, so any kind of growth in labour market wages would severely miss their mark. Eastern European seniors and single mothers are almost 75% in poverty (Latvian data) as social groups - they do not need prosperous economic conditions as much as they need specific, targeted social welfare programmes.

If there is no border, it would be a violation of the responsibilities of member states to protect the customs area.

Option a) is the backstop, option b) is fantasy (which doesn't stop the Brexiteers advocating for it).

3259,"&gt;I do not mind funds from Riga going to Latgale - why could it not be on the European level as well?

What about the people who do mind? That's the point. Many people in Riga have it hard enough - maybe they don't want to help out poorer regions.

&gt;This implies that the groups that need this help will benefit from simple economic prosperity.

Economic prosperity is an ethical approach - it let's people create better situations for themselves, and the countries overall increase in wealth. It gives people opportunity. 

&gt;they do not need prosperous economic conditions as much as they need specific, targeted social welfare programmes.

This is ALWAYS the social democrat answer: more spending, more spending, tax more, redistribute more, spend more. Well, every EU country to my knowledge, except maybe Switzerland and Luxembourg have ever increasing national debts. Clearly redistributing money isn't working in the long run.

Maybe I have better ways to spend my money than helping a single mother. Maybe I want a better life for MY kids, not someone else who couldn't keep a family together or had kids when they shouldn't have. One thing the right supports that the social dems rarely do, is personal responsibility.

Maybe rich people in France don't want to help poor Eastern Europeans. And you know what? There's no reason on this earth they should be forced to.

It should not be he responsibility of government to actually build these houses so a segment of the population gets cheap subsidized housing and the rest have high prices and pay for the subsidies. 

The government needs to enable more space, better town planning and attractive conditions for the development of more housing to take place. 

Once this happens, supply will rise and prices will drop.

3414,"&gt; **aafter four suicide attempts on the same day, he was found alive**

&gt; It is the story of a desperate man and a race against time for the gendarmes of the Eastern Pyrenees. A man tried to kill himself four times in several areas of the department on the same day, reports L'Indépendant.

&gt; Everything begins on Sunday, August 11 in the late afternoon. The gendarmes of the Osséja High Mountain Platoon (PGHM) received a call from a witness claiming to have seen a man stab himself before jumping off a 20-metre cliff in the town of Taulis, about 100 kilometres from Perpignan.

&gt; A few minutes later, they received a second call from the same person who said that the man was cushioned in his fall by trees and that he managed to reach his car on foot before taking the road.
His car embedded in a tree, the driver not found
 
&gt; The gendarmes of a nearby town then went to the scene and managed to identify the unknown. Convinced that man was seeking to end his life, they set out in search of him.

&gt; The hunt lasted two hours, until the gendarmes fell, not on the wanted individual, but on his car, embedded in a tree. The driver reportedly drove at high speed before exiting the vehicle's carcass.

&gt; Thanks to a gendarmerie dog called in as a backup, the search continued until late at night in a hard-to-reach wooded area, through which the suicidal man is said to have passed. But he is still missing. 

&gt; Found the next morning half-conscious

&gt; It was only the next day, Monday, August 12, that the man was finally located in the late morning. He is half-conscious, lying in a stream for several hours, with an open wound on his head. Desperate, the unfortunate man had hit his head with stones several times.

&gt; Significant medical resources have been deployed on site to take care of the victim. The individual was finally evacuated to the hospital in Perpignan in the early afternoon, alive.

&gt;As for the latter part, I mean a Republican France, cannibalizing or otherwise would have been invaded to prop up whatever Nationalist factions remained. Now you have a repressive regime &amp; German soldiers.

France had stayed neutral since the British efforts. France would have remained neutral if Republic had won as well. If you're arguing about a scenario where France haven't remained neutral but helped the republicans, then the war would have been won without nationalists even being able to advance much.

If you're referring to something like Germany invading Spain after taking over France, we don't even know if France would have been fallen if Spanish Civil War ended with a republican victory.

3606,"&gt; I've said it as a reply to ""EU lifts poor places to the level of Western Europe"". Now, some places seen benefits, some haven't but EU isn't functioning enough to lift poor regions to the level of rich Western European standarts. Not sure how this is a sweeping generalisation.

Well, what is ""the level of western Europe""? Try looking as [this statistic](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/9618249/1-26022019-AP-EN.pdf/f765d183-c3d2-4e2f-9256-cc6665909c80) at the rightmost row. I would say that between 75 and 125 is sort of the range ""average Europe"", below is poor, above is afluent. Southern Italy is the same as Romanian average, Slovenia would fit well into France, Greece has districts that go below every single one in Poland, etc. Of course this is PPP but it gives the better impression of how well people are actually doing. In general you can see that Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Ireland, Bavaria, Czechia, Slovakia and the Baltics have done a lot of catchup and have generally benefitted a lot from the EU, meanwhile Portugal, Southern and Eastern Spain, Southern Italy and Greece outside of Athens have been stagnating for ages. Similarly in the east Hungary and Croatia don't really do anything, Bulgaria grows much slower than Romania.

3632,"I'm pretty sure that over the years/centuries Europeans have been valuing material possessions less and less, and settling for just being comfortable, for having enough to live worry-free. Not all of us achieve it, more even because a lot of us are extremely poor compared to the rest. But even so, if you have access to basic needs like health, education, safety and a social and political voice that makes you feel free and heard, then you carry on with a smile on your face. 

I deal with a lot of foreigners in my place of work, and it's quite evident that usually (not always) people from the USA are used to having everything they want handed to them when they're in the position of customers - meaning, they have the money so they're entitled. Money, being the key word here. In their popular culture there is too much focus on what you have, what you can show off, how big your car/house/bank account is. And I honestly think this is a result of an unflinching belief in capitalism, of something they've been sold is the equivalent of success. This is a result of a long and persistent push by big business equating wealth to happiness, and the American people have been slowly conditioned to believe that's completely true. 

In Europe we don't mind living in tiny old houses, driving Smart cars over uneven cobbled streets, or that we sometimes will need to walk to places, instead of driving there. But we do care about our cities, our countries - not in the political sense, but in the ""we live here, so we better make sure it's going to stay here for a while"" sense. I mean, our monuments are not just for show, they're so ingrained in our history that we don't even seen them as monuments, but as proof of what we were, and witnesses to what we've become. And they're very humbling, both for how they represent our achievements and also our past mistakes.

Our concern for the environment seems to be very closely related to this appreciation for a simpler kind of life, where you can just enjoy your existence, your home and your family and friends instead of reveling on how much stuff you have. And on this aspect - this cultural heritage of gathering around a table, of filling a mead hall or a local square just for fun, music, food and drink - I believe the size of our communities is very relevant. We're tiny nations, our inescapable proximity to each other has developed into a tradition of sharing, of spending time together and being a lot more familiar with one another than people who have been kept apart  by geography. And the USA is a HUGE place, where remote communities really only met on days of worship or market. There is also the issue of resources. While in many place in the world people have come together in times of great need, the USA's territory, the land itself is incredibly rich, so people didn't often need one another so much to get through hardship. So, while they're mostly pretty friendly there is still a kind of isolationism and a sense of ""the other"", even among themselves.

All of this combined has left them with a weaker sense of community in relation to strangers, a bit more of distrust in comparison to us. But I don't blame them at all, it's just a consequence of how they developed as a nation and as a society.",,/r/europe/comments/cs38ce/why_are_europeans_so_much_happier_than_americans/exdsjt4/,idistaken,1566185427

Again, Islam is with many negative stuff, but it's pretty positive when it comes to animal related issues in general. 

Many Muslims also believe in many things that are contrary to the belief itself. Unlike practicing Christians, even the practicing Muslims are mostly unaware of the religous rules so it's more than normal. There are also many companies and beneficors out there who are making huge sums by the ""halal"" labels and they're coming up with dumb ideas in order them to buy their products. You don't even need halal shops in Europe, since the assumption of something is being cut by a Christian and not got killed via an electroshock or smashing its head, etc. is simply making something halal.

TLDR: Parents took little me on a bike trip from Sweden to Denmark and it caused me to irrationally hate that piece of shit country of Denmark and cycling. 

(I wish I could not hate Denmark and I hope noone takes it seriously but this experience has scarred me for life. Fuck Denmark)

Fuck bikes!

When I was 7 (almost 8) my parents, my big sister and me went on a bike ride when the bridge between Sweden and Denmark was opened. Plan was to ride through southern Sweden for a day, cross the bridge, drive around in Denmark a bit, camp there, then drove back to Sweden and our car. 

The drive through Sweden was pretty cool. We stopped to steal strawberries, took our time, visited some sights and it made me like that country even more. Had been there on vacation before and I always enjoyed Scandinavia. The bridge crossing was a big event and we even got interviewed by some TV station (my father speaks some Danish). Apparently I was one of the youngest cyclists that day. And they were amazed that we had already driven quite a way through Sweden that day. The bridge itself was pretty fucking boring. Just a huge mass of people and nothing to see. Then we got to Denmark and o got some ice cream because I was close to a tantrum. We drove some more to a campground and camped there. 

Next day my father comes with the Hiob's message. The bridge is closed to bikes. It was only opened for the opening event. 

Now how the fuck do we get to the car and home to Germany? My father could have taken a bus and brought the car back or something. But he had a better idea. We could just ride our bikes through Denmark to \* insert Danish coastal city and take the ferry back to the Swedish town where we had parked the car. Easy peasy. 

And thus began the two days of hell. 

My father had completely miscalculated the distance and the time it would take us to go there. And also the strength and stamina of his little son. And most crucially that Denmark might appear flat but it isn't. Not when you're 7 years old and every hill is mountain for your shitty bike. 

Fucking Denmark. The road we took wasn't a nice bike path. Nope. We had to take the normal roadway and just stay to the side as to not get run over. Did I mention Denmark not being flat? Fucking hills man! And that shit ass road was perfectly straight. No fucking curve over what felt like hundreds of kilometres. So it was a mindless up and down and up and down and always more up than down, you could see in the morning where you would end up in the evening. 

The first day was shit. I was tired and didn't want to go anymore and fuck Denmark and this shit ass road. We didn't even find a camping spot. We just pitched the tent in a ditch next to that God forsaken road. That evening my father noticed how much he had miscalculated. We had to go much faster to get that ferry (either we had to go back home for work/school or it was the last ferry before the weekend or whatever) and we had to get that one. So now the race was on. And no more time to care about little me. 

This is when my parents kind of lost it. They realised that I would bike much faster if they drove far ahead of me and use my panic to speed me up. So they did just that. Drove ahead and checked every now and then if I was still coming. And I trampled my little legs and lungs out in fear of being left alone, run over by cars, picked up or falling over and dying of exhaustion. And no chance to tell them that I needed a break. 

This went on for a bit over a hundred kilometres that day. We had a break once or twice where I cried my eyes out and they gracefully lightened my load a bit (yes I had a backpack and a tent on my bike). But we had no choice. Had to get that fucking ferry. 

We did reach it just in time and my parents look fondly back to that crazy vacation. 

I look back with hatred for Denmark and bikes and asshats who create roads like that. And resentment for my parents of course. 

It's really unfair to a probably great country (I really love Viking history and all that) but whenever I hear of someone mentioning Denmark I can't help but hate this shithole waste of space.

&gt; Anyway, Portugal has 2 official languages and this map miserably fails to acknowledge that.

&gt; Extreme North Eastern Portugal speaks Leonês. A dialect related with the Spanish Leonese we see in the map.

Check your glasses. Top north east corner is painted yellow. Mirandese, Leonese.

Also you say:

&gt; One could argue Nothern vs Southern but it's more a question of accent than anything else these days.

&gt; Maybe 60 years ago you could argue something different but not now.

But Portuguese wikipedia says:

&gt; Actualmente, considera-se que, no território português continental, há duas grandes subdivisões dialectais: os dialectos setentrionais e os dialectos centro-meridionais

And English one:

&gt; The southern and central dialects are broadly characterized by preserving the distinction between /b/ and /v/, and by the tendency to monophthongize ei and ou to [e̞] and [o̞]. They include the dialect of the capital, Lisbon, but it has some peculiarities of its own. Although the dialects of the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira have unique characteristics, as well, they can also be grouped with the southern dialects.

&gt; The northern dialects are characterized by preserving the pronunciation of ei and ou as diphthongs [ei̯], [ou̯], and by somewhat having sometimes merged /v/ with /b/ (like in Spanish).

While we're on the topic, how is disqualifying a student from her GCSE for saying something the exam board doesn't like fair and reasonable? If the comments on halal meat weren't relevant to the question then the examiner could've just not awarded the student the marks for it and moved on.

3948,"M5S: Movimento Cinque Stelle is a very heterogeneous movement with no real ideology behind (legality and transparency aren't political principles), it's solely based on frustration and disappointment. As long as they weren't ruling, they were fine. Complaining about the others is the easiest way to get votes. But once they got into power (both locally and nationally), they proved inept and out of their depth. Most of their frontmen and frontwomen don't have the experience and skills to be politicians (Hell, I've had more experience than them when I had long hair and great ideals), they stumbled into their position for real.

FI: Forza Italia is strongly tied to Berlusconi, it's his own party after all (He's still the leader after 30 years, there's no real ""heir"" or alternative, it's his personal toy). When Berlusconi was a successful businessman, FI was soaring...but now he has aged and his communication is clearly outdated (when TV was the main media, he looked badass: he had timing, charisma and oozed personality. He could win votes with ease...well having your own TV helped as well), scandals damaged his image and his enterprises aren't as successful as they used to be.

Lega: There are many reasons behind Lega's success and I'll probably forget some. Salvini and his staff know how to use social medias to reach many people who felt ""left behind"" by traditional politicians, he knows how to speak to crowds and how to interact with people: he takes many selfies with his fans as if he was some sort of movie star, he shares his meals on instagram like an influencer and he speaks about normal stuff when he has the chance, for instance he often talks about his favorite team (AC Milan). All these things make him appear like ""one of us"" for his electors. 

Also he took advantage of the political vacuum in Italy (FI is dying, PD is busy fighting itself and M5S is too dumb to realize what was happening) to gather all the attention on himself with anything. He monopolized every argument with his version, if we talk about immigration, we end up talking about him. If we talk about taxes, we end up talking about him. 

Moreover he turned Lega inside out. For decades Lega was a minor party (which was very strong in the north but totally absent in the south and center), which was focussed on stuff like autonomy and local matters...but he turned it into a national force by moving its focus on national matters like immigration (for years Lega spoke against the south and center, basically treating them like second class citizens) and EU. Right now people feel unsafe for many reasons (Economy is stagnating, wages aren't improving, working conditions worsened...), so it's easy to blame it on immigrants or politicians who live on the other side of the continent (EU bureaucrats).",Italy,/r/europe/comments/cs442w/italy_poll/excyo1z/,SabatiniTheAndal,1566162885
3949,"&gt; There was no 3% GDP growth in the 80s Poland

So IMF is wrong? 

&gt;Also, after the debt-fueled 70s growth

Commie Poland had about 15% debt. Now its at 60%+. Spain at the time had 40%+ debt.

&gt;abrubtly crashed, the next time Poland reached 1977-1978 GDP levels was in mid-90s, which again puts that supposed ""3% a year growth throughout the 80s"" into question.

2008 crash was so bad it took many economies 10 years to recover. Muh capitalism!

Also super success of Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal,.. ! I wonder how much winning can capitalism take?

Face it, circumstances matter. 

&gt;Nobody who lived through the hell that was 80s Poland, with food shortages and lack of basic goods comparable with worst post-war years would believe that bullshit.

3950,"&gt;we agree on the funds every 7 years, after 2020 the east is going to recieve a cut in funding, we, the ones that pay. should reserve the right to which countries we would most like that funding to go.

Yes, which is for economic development mostly. I don't see how that would relate to a discussion on say immigration or social issues. Especially when we do look the other way on those things with other countries. Hungary was the bad guy on immigration, while France is illegally sending people back to Spain, and Spain is doing all it can to prevent people from crossing from Morocco in turn for example.

&gt;besides, the anti brussels and anti west campaign in Poland and Hungary does not endear them to us. yet us suggesting a cut in funding is somehow wrong.

Then why is support for the EU so high there? I mean:

&gt;A survey published last month claimed **91% of Poles questioned supported being in the bloc**, with 85% believing it has boosted the economy.

Romania had a fascist government for exactly 1 year, btw. The rest of it was under military dictatorship.

You also conveniently skip over the fact that Romania started negotiating peace with the western allies in November 1941 and the Romanian army had plans to attack the Germans as early as December 1940. The romanian government wanted germany to lose the war, but only after beating Stalin.

Who knows - their numbers don't add up. For example, they claim a 10% GDP drop in 1981, yet the total number is pretty much the same as it was in 1980.

And it managed to crash its economy! Truly shows the sustainability of communism.

&gt;2008 crash was so bad it took many economies 10 years to recover. 

Well, not for Poland, so I guess it works for us.

&gt;Also super success of Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal,.. ! I wonder how much winning can capitalism take?

One more decade of recession there, and sustained high growth levels here, and maybe we will even reach their levels of GDP per capita again - the last time it happened was in early 1950s, right after our country got utterly destroyed by WW2.

Importing cheaper east European products didn’t long-term decrease prices in west Europe, it only increased the profits of those selling them. Same happened with outsourcing of manufacturing and everything else really. The difference in pricing wasn’t result of differences in value, but of how much people are ready to spend on it.
If you think that stuff is too expensive in western countries, then why dont you try to export something there from the east and make a shit ton of money ? I think you would quickly understand how wrong you are.

The ones making the real money are the ones selling those products, the ones that already have more money and more assets to begin with that allow them to get cheaper wholesale prices from the producers and as such have higher margins than smaller competitors that allow them to grow bigger and bigger.

4073,"Exactly. People also do not know that the nature of Marx' work is historical and not idealogical, in fact, he never defines communism at all. All he says is that capitalism will eventually fall under its own contradictions and whatever rises out of the fall (by revolution) will not have the same problems capitalism has, and, since human suffering is largely caused by the alienation as a result of capitalism, will result in happy human beings (socialism).

Now if we consider Soviet Russia let's have a look:

\- The problems of capitalism were not solved by the revolution

\- In fact, arguably capitalism didnt yet have a grip on Russia as it was not industrialized

\- Wealth and power was not redistributed, it shifted into the hands of a totalitarian government. This government then tried to forcefully remove some aspects of society Marx said would go away on their own if capitalism falls , ie religion.

4126,"&gt;Jews have a right to be suspicious of outsiders after such a long history of oppression.

The opposite is more fitting. Non Jews should be suspicious of Jews, after all it's Jews who have been expelled from everywhere they go. Just a couple of years ago, a group of natives in a Guatemalan town had a group of Jews expelled. A group of people that probable doesn't know about Europe or Hitler had Jews expelled, this was probably their first contact with Jews btw.

&gt;Israel is the only Jewish country on earth, it's tiny, and yet it's 75% Jewish.  Jews are not exclusive people.  It's funny because you think Jews are exclusive yet they're simultaneously plotting to flood ""white"" countries that they too live in with ""brown"" people.

I am fine with there being a Jewish state. But they are actively participating in things that increase immigration to white cpuntries, listen to Barbara Spectre.

https://youtu.be/pk_KS0C_ZOA

And then you have thousands of Rabbis sign a letter in support of immigration reform.

https://www.hias.org/1000-rabbis-sign-letter-support-welcoming-refugees

I am not making this stuff up. There are Jewish NGOs helping migrants resettle in Europe. Look at this video. 

&gt;Yup.  I'm a proud Zionist and most decent people are Zionists.  Zionist means Jews have a right to self determination in their homeland.  Just like how you undoubtedly believe white ethnicities have a right to self determination in their homelands.

Correct, yet when whites wamt to self determinate what direction their coubtries take, Jews are fast to call it white supremacy, fanatism, natiobalism, they claim it's another shoah. It seems to me that Jews want a nation of their own, but don't want other's to have a nation of their own.

&gt;I love this white supremacist talking point, pretending to care about Arabs to use them for your racist ideologies just like Hitler did.  You have a poor mastery of English.  Go look up the definition of anti-semitic and you'll see it's solely about Jews.  Then look up the word ""misnomer.""

Arabs are semitic people too, you are dehumanizing them by claiming they are not what they are. Even Christianity is a Semitic religion like Judaism but you wouldn't call a Christian a semite, would you? Of course not because right now ""anti-semitism"" is a powerful remark, a slander. I don't live in America, but if I went there and put on a 6 point star necklace, I could claim anti-semitism and people would just leave me alone, this is a powerful statement and it is used and abused by Jews, and only by Jews. And one reason why you say arabs are not semites is because, if they are semites then they would have a right to be in Israel, but you don't want them there of course.",,/r/europe/comments/crxiu0/expulsion_of_jews_in_europe_11001600/excdq6w/,TryhardPantiesON,1566148331

Until then thousands of Jews fled to Portugal as it was one of the last western European territories to be a safe harbor.

This was extremely helpful as they brought immense amounts of money and knowledge to a remote place of western Europe that was struggling from isolation between the vast unknown ocean and a mortal enemy in Spain.

A lot of contributions from Jewish communities were instrumental to the Portuguese maritime expansion and the creation of it's global empire. An empire that some say to have been the first step to modern day Globalization. 

When the Pope finally issued the order to apply the inquisition most of them faked being Christians or were allowed to act like such by locals who weren't interested in losing valuable human citizens. The others fled to Brasil. 

Note: In 1506 4000 Jews were burnt in Lisbon. This had nothing to do with the inquisition as over 90K  Jews had fled from Spain previously.

&gt; freaking babies were stolen (How can you compare this with anything else and call yourself human, for god's sake, they stole babies out of their mothers). 

Agree with you here

&gt;The fascist state destroyed our land [...] and caused an economic debacle ruining our economy for centuries to come.

That's just plain wrong:

Reforms were implemented in the 1950s and Spain abandoned autarky, delegating authority from the Falangist movement, which had been prone to isolationism, to a new breed of economists, the so-called technocrats of Opus Dei.[8] This led to massive economic growth, second only to Japan, that lasted until the mid-1970s, known as the ""Spanish miracle"". 

&gt;practice a genocide on the Spanish people

Do you know what genocide means?

&gt;40 years of terror fell on Spain, and still due to political indoctrination some people dare to say ""fascist and democrats were the same"". From those who were indoctrinated during fascist I can understand (you cooperate or you would be killed), but for those who were born in the democracy I cannot understand who there's still people defending those monsters.

What you fail to see is that at no point have I defended Franco, or that the fascists and the democrats were the same; but I am trying to fight against the disinformation practiced by many new politicians in Spain since they try to make it seem like Republicans were angels when that could not be further from the truth. 

And you'll ask me why I don't point out the bad things Nationalists did, and that's because a) you've already done it in the comment I'm replying to, b) everybody is already aware of that whereas the majority of people are not aware of the truth behind what the republicans did.",,/r/europe/comments/cryrji/on_this_day_83_years_ago_the_great_spanish_poet/exbzj7b/,Erryuio,1566140891

4246,"&gt;WTO rules kick in until a trade deal is made with other countries. WTO tariffs between the U.K. and Eu will still be relatively low at around 3 percent. Though higher for cars for example.

That's rather skirting around the bigger issues. Average tariff is around 2.8% yes, but that's weight down by the number that are 0% and even then, in a tight market, that's the difference between sales and not. 40% of our farm trade is with the EU, under WTO , dairy is 35%, lamb is 40%. The British ceramic confederation has warned that the 12% tariff on their goods would devastate the industry. Sweets are 21.1%, animal products 15.5%, fish 11.6%. Our chemical industry generates £50bn of exports a year worldwide, they'll be 4.6% higher. It's estimated our grocery shopping will go up by £9.3bn a year due to tariffs (based on the 2017 food import total of £34bn a year).

&gt;WTO has already indicated its looking forward to the U.K. being back and championing free trade within the organisation.

We already have free trade, negotiated with the weight of the EU behind it.

&gt;Other countries may offer a trade deal that is more favourable than the one the Eu has. For example Canada have indicated this

The CETA free trade deal is already a great deal. We lose that for no deal with the deal proposed with Canada on hold (which was basically to roll over CETA, I am not sure where Canada has indicated we can get a better deal?

&gt;Regardless, it’s change and that’s disruptive but by no means the end of the world.

No but the government's own leaked analysis even of a good case scenario is predicted shortages, months of disruption, exporters unable to do so, fuel panics, strikes etc, let alone worse case.

&gt;Regarding free movement, depending on which estimate and parameters you use migrants either positively add to the economy or negatively. Lots of assumptions are made about this and I’ve yet to find an independent evaluation. Often assumptions don’t include the number of children migrants have. Or they assume a certain percentage will go back home. Long term impact on services tend to be ignored and impact of large numbers of migrants to areas. The downward pressure on low paid wages are often ignored.

I have not seen any studies that show migrants to the UK contributing economically except from the obviously biased Migration Watch group. Studies from people like Oxford Economics (linked below) show on average they contribute more to the economy hat British people do on average.

https://fullfact.org/immigration/do-eu-immigrants-contribute-134-every-1-they-receive/

Low paid jobs cannot go lower than minimum wage

&gt; Regarding the CBI, well they are not unbiased. Large industry like the car industry benefit from a protectionist market like the Eu has. They lobby the cbi quite heavily. 

CBI represent businesses, they are biased towards their members yes. Their members provide us with jobs and income, I'd go with them over politicians

&gt;For people like me that have an issue with how the Eu is governed being in the single market and custom union means that the Eu has too much control of the U.K.

Jews lend non Jews loans with interest. In the Talmud and the bible Jews aren’t allowed to charge other Jews interest, but it makes no such claim for non Jews.

The Rothschild dynasty became extremely wealthy this way, instead of loaning to other businesses they began loaning to governments at interest, and when countries can’t pay back the loans they practically own them. The federal reserve is just one example of this. A centralized entity which doesn’t answer to the US and plays with the currency as it sees fit.

This is one of the major reasons for anti semitism - not just the Jesus stuff, the Bolshevik revolution also spurred a lot of hatred and is largely comprised of Jews.

There are many other reasons I don’t want to get into but I just wanted to dispute the first point.

I come from a family that fled the Pontic Greek genocide and grew up in a household in which my mother, a Byzantinologist, used to push us to study Byzantine and Ottoman history as it was extremely interesting to her. Turkish history was always a discussion and not in a folk level kind of discussion but in an academic way. I grew up and chose a career in finance and have worked in Asia (India) and US (New Mexico). I've been around the block a few times and my views are from from ""lightly interested"". I am very educated on the topic and soon plan to learn Turkish too. I like the country, its people and our common Anatolian heritage and culture. I am far from biased. Feel free to discuss anything as long as you keep it civil.

It is not particularly friendly towards very small entrepreneurs, but it's a good place for small-to-medium businesses. If you can get a business off the ground, you'll have a much easier time in Denmark than in the US. You will get taxed pretty heavily of course.  


Denmark isn't socialist, unless you consider the pension funds owning a lot of stock in major companies as an indirect form of socialism (but that's the case in the US too).

There's actually a lot of Danish companies doing business in India, outsourcing some of their business or even having actual divisions located there. Trade isn't as good as could be, for historic reasons (there's a Dane wanted for terrorism that India is upset about not getting extradited, among other things), but I think this will be changing soon with more trade flowing both ways. Plenty of Indians come here to work, and several parties in parliament are working hard to include India among the list of countries with favorable status when it comes to work permits (which lowers the salary threshold to allow a stay).

4557,"When it comes to eating out, as for Polish food, I recommend ""Kuchnia u Babci Maliny"" in the Old town, which usually has food like grandma makes it, and the atmosphere is nice but it's usually filled with students so it can get crowdy sometimes. Also, pretty much every place in Krakow accepts payment by card but this place is an exception (at least that was the case the last time I went).

More places I recommend are 
-Vegab: they have really delicious vegan kebabs and the sizes are quite big so you get really full. Don't worry if you're not vegan though, a lot of my meat-eating friends love Vegab too.
-Dolnych Młynów: it's not a restaurant but it's a whole urban-style complex with a bunch of bars, clubs and restaurants. The atmosphere is generally great and it's pretty popular among students in general so I'd recommend checking this place out, it's pretty interesting bc the complex actually used to be a tobacco factory back in the 19th/first half 20th century. 

Personally, my fave district in Kraków is Kazimierz (Jewish Quarter), it's a great area to have a drink. Plenty of niche bars and restaurants with a unique atmosphere! I recommend Alchemia, Hevre, Kolanko no6, Mleczarnia, Eszeweria...honestly the list goes on and on, in this case it also depends on personal preferences.

There's also the Podgórze area which I don't go to very often but it does have a lot of great hidden spots to explore.

I proclaim to you that Turkey (Ottoman Empire) is a land wherein nothing is lacking, and where, if you will, all shall yet be well with you. The way to the Holy Land lies open to you through Turkey. Is it not better for you to live under Muslims than under Christians? Here every man may dwell at peace under his own vine and fig-tree. Here you are allowed to wear the most precious garments. In Christendom, on the contrary, you dare not even venture to clothe your children in red or in blue, according to your taste, without exposing them to insult of being beaten black and blue, or kicked red and green, and therefore are you condemned to go about meanly clad in sad-colored raiment. All of your days are full of sorrow, even the Shabbats and the times appointed for feasting. Strangers enjoy your goods, and, therefore, of what profit is the wealth of your rich men? They hoard it but to their own sorrow, and in a day it is lost to them forever. You call your riches your own -- alas, they belong to them! and they bring false accusations against you. They respect neither age nor wisdom; and though they gave you a pledge sealed sixty-fold, yet would they break it. they continually lay double punishment upon you, a death of torment and confiscation of goods.

1. ...Should a Jew be taken to court, not just only a Christian must testify against him, but also a Jew, in order for the case to be considered valid.2. ... If any Christian shall sue a Jew, asserting that he has pawned securities with him, and the Jew denies it, then if the Christian refuses to accept the simple word of the Jew, the Jew by taking oath must be free of the Christian.10. ... As punishment for killing a Jew, a suitable punishment and confiscation of property is necessary.11. ... For striking a Jew, the usual punishment in the country shall apply.13. ... Jews shall not pay for the transport of their dead.14. Christian destroying cemetery except normal penalty will lose assets.17. ...Any Jew may freely and securely walk or ride without any let or hindrance in our realm. They shall pay customary tolls just as other Christians do, and nothing else.22. ... If any of the Christians rashly and presumptuously jeers at their synagogues, such a Christian shall be required to pay and must pay to our palatine their guardian two talents of pepper as punishment.30. ... No Christian may summon any Jew into the ecclesiastical court in any way whatsoever, or for whatever property or summons he be summoned, nor shall the Jew make answer before the judge in the ecclesiastical court, but the Jew shall appear before his palatine appointed for that term, and furthermore the aforesaid palatine, along with our governor for that term, shall be required to defend and protect that Jew, and prohibit his responding to the summons of the ecclesiastical court.

&gt; For the period 2014-2021, Norway’s annual contribution to 15 beneficiary states through the current EEA and Norway Grants scheme will be 391 million euro.

&gt; Norway participates in a number of EU programmes through provisions in the EEA Agreement or on the basis of bilateral agreements with the EU. The largest are the Horizon 2020 and, Erasmus+, Galileo and Copernicus. Norway contributes to the budget of the programmes it participates in, and on equal footing with EU member states. For the period 2014-2020, Norway’s average annual commitment is 447 million euros.

&gt; Norway’s  cooperation with the EU in the field of justice and home affairs, including participation in the Schengen cooperation and agreements on cooperation in various areas, also entails some financial contributions. The annual contribution in 2015 was almost 6 million euro.

&gt; In addition, for the period 2014-2020, Norway contributes around 25 million euro annually for our contribution in programmes under the European Territorial Cooperation INTERREG.

I'll finish by asking : do you think it is a mere *coincidence* that the East Asians closed their service sectors to outside investment for the longest time but only opened up to FDI in export-oriented manufacturing? 

The reality is that domestic-oriented service sector stuff doesn't really need much FDI, but you can get fat profits from there and Western companies do that. This was a condition for entering the EU. So can we now drop the self-serving bullshit narrative about charity?

4700,"Saturday 17th August [2019 20](tel:201920):05. I (Male, black British) was traveling on a boat back to the bus station in Venice. Bought the wrong boat ticket and was in the process of getting fined. I was asking questions to the person that was dealing with me, when this officer decided to interject and ignore my questions whilst incessantly repeating the fee amount. 

Since she wasn't answering my questions, I told her to stop interrupting so I could carry on with the process with the officer that was dealing with me. Things took a turn for the worse. She started to raise her voice and became more aggressive. I matched her tone and called her out for being rude and confrontational. This is when she decided to parade her ""police"" badge (transit police) and demand that I respect her authority. I took a picture of her because I wanted to report her to her company. 

She started to get more angry and said that taking a picture is illegal. She then started to shout and swear at me in Italian and English. Since the fee was already paid at this point, I repeatedly told her to leave me alone and to stop antagonising me. I started to walk away, still insisting that she let me be, but then she escalated and called me a monkey in Italian and cussed my mother. I retaliated and shouted back. 

It was not until I crossed the street that she finally left me alone. I tried to file a complaint with the nearest ticket office but was turned away as they weren't owned by Actv (the boat company). I still plan on filing a complaint during business hours.

TLDR: Bought a wrong ticket. Was fined. Officer was aggressive and hurled racist remarks at me.",,/r/europe/comments/crx5x6/i_was_harassed_by_this_racist_italian_officer/exaczux/,Venicewaslovely,1566104860

Kosovo.

&gt;  Vojvodina? It's majority Serbian

It's gotten autonomy for a reason.

&gt; The only non-Serb majority parts of Serbia that I can remember that might want to break away are Presevo Valley (mostly Albanian) and the Bulgarian majority areas annexed after WW1 

And like all of Kosovo. Which is a lot for a country that small in area.

&gt; But I haven't heard of any strong separatist movements for those areas. 

I don't necessarily mean separatist movements, but areas that need to be given autonomy because of inside issues, related mostly to minorities, such as Vojvodina, which is like the upper half of the country. It doesn't have any separatist movements, sure, but it has gotten autonomy for a reason. I mean, governments don't usually hand out autonomy as a measure of good will, but to ease potential tensions.

4976,"&gt; Poverty alone is sufficient, you are misinformed again.

Whoops.

&gt; Poverty alone does not necessarily qualify someone for Medicaid. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid

Whoops!

&gt; Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides health coverage or nursing home coverage to certain categories of low-asset people, including children, pregnant women, parents of eligible children, people with disabilities and elderly needing nursing home care. Medicaid was created to help low-asset people who fall into one of these eligibility categories ""pay for some or all of their medical bills.""^[63]

&gt; While Congress and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) set out the general rules under which Medicaid operates, each state runs its own program. Under certain circumstances, an applicant may be denied coverage. As a result, the eligibility rules differ significantly from state to state, although all states must follow the same basic framework.

&gt; As of 2013, Medicaid is a program intended for those with low income, but a low income is not the only requirement to enroll in the program. Eligibility is categorical—that is, to enroll one must be a member of a category defined by statute; some of these categories include low-income children below a certain wage, pregnant women, parents of Medicaid-eligible children who meet certain income requirements, low-income disabled people who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and/or Social Security Disability (SSD), and low-income seniors 65 and older. The details of how each category is defined vary from state to state.

Yes it would.

States would truly give up their *sovereignty* in EU matters.

Also Hungary can be one of transport roads from China: currently for trucks from Aegean sea (ports Thessaloniki, Patras) and in the future if infrastructure is build also from Romanian ports in black sea.

Weather this is their plan not to indent Hungary too much I am not sure. Perhaps Hungary is advanced enough and in good enough situation not to take too big debts than it can handle. In the end underdeveloped countries feel usually in this Chinese trap.

But it would be smart of them not to antagonize EU countries, but rather create friends and best dependent state, which would loose cutting out China.

That's not what I was implying. If you deal with trauma processing intensively you will eventually realize that literally every mental health issue is a defensive mechanism to protect you from more trauma, depression including - it's part of what's colloquially known as the freeze mechanism. 

Now, of course - there are always exceptions to the rule - some mental illnesses are genetically caused but from observation it is obvious that at least 95% of all mental illnesses stem from trauma itself. The reason why it is not more widely known is because wether you yourself are traumatized is a very subjective thing to define and literally everyone will deny it because the only way someone can recognize they were or are being traumatized is by being told so. It's another defense mechanism. 

So when you try to find a link between trauma and depression of course you're not going to find a 100% overlap because these things rely on surveys and why these are unreliable - see the former paragraph. If someone who is in denial about their own trauma surveys people on their trauma the results will obviously be skewed.",Austria,/r/europe/comments/crns5h/the_happy_nordic_countries_antidepressant_use/ex88f4r/,LavishSalamander,1566070097

Good. You accuse me of racism just because you decided that I'm racist. Let me tell you one thing. In Russia, the country where I live, Islam is second most practiced religion, first being Orthodox Christianity. And Russia is **very** nationally diverse. You can't predict people's religion just by looking at their appearance and trying to guess their race (good luck with that, there's tens of them). I live among people of different nations, I study with them, I talk to them, and I know first-hand that racism as a belief is both baseless and divisive. However, I have problems with overly devoted religious followers, particularly Muslims and evangelical Orthodox Christians. That's my reasoning.

And since those other Member States are also importing stuff from said western European countries, more money means more imports, making the companies richer, thus *in theory* indeed feeding those Euros right back into the net-paying EU country by supporting the economy and generating jobs.

Germany's trade with the V4 exceeds that of their trade with either China or the US, and by a *lot*. More importantly, these countries are key suppliers in the German supply chain. There are too many economic interests at stake here to gamble it away. Macron may want to do it, but he will lose every single time when up against German industrial interests. Every time.

Finally, EE loses about 3% of GDP in foreign profits being drawn away every year. 1% (net) of their GDP comes in as EU funds.

Problem also is that nobody has the time to govern when you're having elections every 12-24 months. Everybody is always just constantly campaining so shit does never get done. Problem with the election frequency in Italy is that the last time a Prime Minister had a solid majority it was Berlusconi. And he's one of the main reasons our country it's where it's at right now. It started in the 80s when he backed Craxi, and then continueed thru the 90s and 00s with him as our PM. Other than him nobody had a full mandate, left being left everybody just stabs each other in the back, so even when you manage to have a majority it never works.

I am a radical environmentalist and I do not condone all of this useless pollution just because it's the ""traditional way"".

Discouraging the diffusion of these foods is caused by the protectionist scheme: the strict production and quality rules for the food (which are great) are inseparably coupled with the geographic protection: this gives this protection a higher brand value and in turn diminishes the value of other food made in the same way but elsewhere.

Granted, it's a painful thing to see the difference between gross and nett, but there's a second side to this.

In my case, I'd go from a starting wage that's at about the national average to something quite a bit more. But I'd have to stard dealing with healthcare considerations which would eat up quite a bit of money, but also a lot of time and probably cause plenty of stress. On top of that, I'd need to pay back whatever my education might have cost in a private system - and that's assuming I got my degree in the first place given that change in conditions. 

And then there are the bigger issues that people don't think of as personal, but are important in their daly life. Subsidised public transit - it's good enough in my area that I haven't needed to buy a car even though I could comfortably affort one. Reduced income inequality and the effects that has on how safe it is for me to jogg in my part of the city at night to how likely it is that my phone (or whatever) will be returned if I happen to forget it somewhere.

The USA learned lessons from the First World War, and even more so from the Great Depression. After Europe blew themselves up the first time, America _loaned_ Europe money to rebuild -- a so called ""beggar thy neighbor"" policy. The bankrupt Europeans couldn't pay the Americans back, nor could the bankrupt Europeans pay themselves back. One nation after the other experience a horrible economic collapse, pulling the world off the Gold Standard and onto the backing of the American Dollar. The Great Depression saw the rise of Modern Economics, beginning with this pulling off the Gold Standard. 

After World War 2, instead of ""bankrupting thy neighbor"", America decided to _lend_  to Europe, accepting the losses when they were lost. From this _lending_ policy came the Bretton-Woods Era, which brought amazing growth worldwide because America was untouched by devastation. 

Now, I am not saying America was the savior of the globe. While that may be considered in an _economic_ point, such a statement would overlook the incredible hard work that both European Nations and other nations abroad took (basically, google ""Asian Tigers"" to see how the rest of the world flourished post-WW2).

5764,"**For the sixth time, people with paedophile tendencies took part in the demonstration of LGBT+ ""Prague Pride"". Czech paedophiles are pleased with the change of attitude towards them by the police, who recently detained them and now protect them. In the press, however, the defenders of family and faith are referred to as 'extremists'.

**

A demonstration of people representing sexual minorities has been organised in Prague since 2011. This year, during Saturday's gathering on Wenceslas Square in Prague on LGBT people, the image of Our Lady of Czestochowa appeared in a rainbow halo, which was published, among others, by the Czech portal ""Novinky.cz"".

Members and supporters of the „Ceskoslovenska pedofilna komunita” organisation joined the LGBT+ community during this year's Prague Pride. For the sixth time during the Prague parade, they want to draw attention to the paedophile community, which demands greater tolerance for themselves. The paedophiles themselves also want to accept their inclinations and classify them as ""sexual minority"". This time, paedophiles have prepared four versions of leaflets for the rainbow parade, with which they wanted to make the visitors and viewers aware of their problems. Two versions of the leaflets were addressed to members of the paedophile community, the other two to people supporting their environment.



The LGBT demonstration was accompanied by music events, and participants could benefit from free tests for syphilis and HIV. The ""Prague Pride"" was attended by a large number of members of the diplomatic corps from foreign institutions located in the Czech capital and the President of Prague Zdenek Hrib. Hrib hosted the Czech capital in November 2018. He is a member of the Czech Pirate Party, which co-manages the capital city together with the local organisation Praha Sobe, a political group that brings together local governments called Mayors and Independents and a political party TOP 09 (Tradition of Responsibility for Prosperity 09) that considers itself as centre-right and conservative.

Thousands of demonstrators from ""Prague Pride"" faced dozens of people with banners, from which they reminded LGBT people that ""Only Jesus Christ can protect you from hell"" and preachers: ""Fear God and worship Him. LGBT demonstrators shouted to them that ""God is a woman"". As described in the Czech press (""Idnes.cz"", ""Novinky.cz""), the police cordoned off the march of sexual minorities from ""extremists"".",Poland,/r/europe/comments/crk05e/czech_paedophiles_want_to_see_them_as_another/ex5wv2h/,Duchowicz,1566033869

But to crack the code in the first place the British had to allow several convoys of food and military aid ships to be sunk on the way from the US to the UK and Russia... Literally civilian ships, it was horrific. The worst part is that the code breakers themselves cracking the codes were the ones who had to decide which convoys would get sunk by German U-Boats, imagine having to live with that.  

The reason is after the Germans changed the code the first time they kept the weather reporting codes the same, as they used a different cipher (weren't considered top-secret info I guess). The British had the old weather code book which had been grabbed last minute from a captured U-Boat in the Mediterranean whilst being searched (but also sinking due to being scuttled by the crew after capture). Several sailors lost their lives just grabbing that book alone, only guy one made it out the U-Boat alive.

Using the old weather code they were able to work out the new one as long as they knew the exact positions of the U-Boats, but the only way to know the exact position of a U-Boat if you're sat in Bletchley Park is to receive it from an SOS call by a convoy being attacked.

So they sent mercenary armies of Nubians to slaughter Greek nationalists at first, then Greek towns in general.

5868,"20+ years ago I was at a hostel in Budapest when a big group of Finns showed up. Two or three members of the group were in a band, which they mentioned at some point while we were all drinking in the basement bar of said hostel. I remember the one guy I was talking to was named Anti (ant-tea) and said he was in college and said something about how he gets money for going to school, so he didn’t want to get a job and instead focus on his band and stay in college (or maybe his apartment was free?). Something like that, I can’t remember the details now but anyway, he and those dudes were trying to make it, and he was pretty serious about it, and i thought that was amusing. Like, “Sure foreign dude, have a metal band, you know, odds of bands blowing up maybe aren’t that great but whatever you are into is cool.”

I partied with the whole group a couple nights and eventually everyone went their separate ways. I kept in touch with one of the girls for a little bit and emailed back and forth with Anti two or three times, but that was about it.

Maybe fifteen years later something reminded me of that and I googled and it turns out the band is still around. That was neat. Then maybe four years ago, when I had occasion to go to Finland I talking to some random dude at a bar I mentioned the band because dude said he was into metal music and was explaining how that was Finland’s specialty. The guy was like “of course I know Stamina. They are famous.”

One thing I would add to your list is that most of high rise buildings are office spaces. If not for a couple of 60/70s commie blocks, 50s utopian living quarters for the bestest builders of socialism mixed with few patches of pre war architecture, Warsaw’s city center would be desolate by night.

&gt; so that's why skyscrapers are bad for everyone, but great for ego of the owner.

In case of Warsaw it’s also playing nicely into the common sentiment of “look we’re part of the west now, we have skyscrapers and shit!”. Our collective ego is also having stakes in this game. And to be absolutely honest, I do love coming back to Warsaw. Seeing the skyline emerging on the horizon always gets me. But I’m equally relieved when leaving.

5921,"&gt; Putin is many thing but stupid doesn't appear to be one of them.

That is I totally agree. But I do not agree with your conclusions from that:

&gt; why would Russia do something that gives USA an excuse to invade? 

If USA would be really eager to invade Russia, then Georgia and Ukraine would be sufficient excuses for them to do that. In reality, Putin correctly estimated that NATO in general and US specifically will look for any kind of excuse not to intervene. My estimation, is that he will invade Europe not when he sees that he has enough military power to take on NATO head on, but when his military will be strong enough for significant number of NATO countries to look for whatever excuses they can find not to intervene. Then he will start to use his battle tested ""hybrid warfare salami tactics"" against Baltic states. Or against Finland, if he concludes that NATO's unity is too strong for now. 

For the matter of fact, I believe that the above scenario would already happen, if Putin wouldn't decide that situation in Syria requires his intervention and oil price wouldn't drop. Russian TV was really sounded like they are preparing their population exactly for that till they declared about the Syrian campaign.

There is a reason that Baltic states and Poland defense budgets are skyrocketing: they understand Putin's thinking way better than the West Europe.",Israel,/r/europe/comments/cr48lo/military_personnel_and_expenditures_in_europe/ex5b0wy/,Gen_Zion,1566020153

&gt;Thus, foreigners are far more strongly represented in the statistics than their share of the population (13 percent). The reference that the strong overrepresentation of foreigners in violent crime is due to the higher proportion of young men can explain that much less than previously known. Source: statistics of the Federal Criminal Police Office",,/r/europe/comments/cr396w/farright_crimes_in_germany_rise_in_2019_the/ex5g6fe/,d_agostino,1566023213
