&gt; Sir Humphry made a bit of a mess of naming this new element, at first spelling it *alumium* (this was in **1807**) then changing it to *aluminum*, and finally settling on *aluminium* in 1812. His classically educated scientific colleagues preferred *aluminium* right from the start, because it had more of a classical ring, and chimed harmoniously with many other elements whose names ended in *–ium*, like *potassium*, *sodium*, and *magnesium*, all of which had been named by Davy.

Other than that, being agitated over any spelling rift between North America and Europe is one of our treasured traditions, so don't you dare and take it away from us!

439,"&gt; USA is losing power against the rising economies of the Asia

Relatively yes. But the US is still the strongest and will remain so for decades to come. And it will never be a weak nation that can easily be pushed around by any single other player. From a perspective of how to best maintain their position at the top and make sure they can't be imposed on it's not out of the question to preemptively dismantle the parts of the international system that could be used for that imposing on them later on if they lose effective control of the institutions. 

In a free for all the US will be able to hold its own even if it isn't strictly the strongest anymore just like China and Russia can more or less do today. But in a ready made international system dominated by someone else they'd have a much harder time. Better to make sure that no such system exists to be exploited by the time the US isn't the top dog.

&gt; the fuck are you on?

I am a polish worker. And I am an engineer.

And I have many polish friends abroad, in western Europe, mostly engineers, even doctors. 

Guess the fuck what. I never came to Germany. Germany invited me. Signed the contract, as I still had a good job in Poland. I said to myself- why the fuck not. 

I pay more tax, than an average statistical German native. I never committed a crime, or anything like that. I do not say, that Germans now must respect Laws of PiSlamists from Poland, or whatever.

Now, you say ban me. Well, okay, ummm... 

&gt; Poles arent any better in my eyes to any other immigrant group, the fact that you think they are says a lot about you.`

A lot about me, like? I was saying about workers. Not, that their humans life mean more, or anything. You are the small uncle Adolf here, remember?

They do not perform that many crimes, like the ones from different cultures. It is a fucking fact.

A lot of them, are season workers. After strawberries are over, go home. A lot of them know English or other European language. A lot of them are better qualified, since the education system in Poland is much higher developed. Yes, there are still morons, but statistically, it is better.
Anyway, they are going to Poland, at least to visit families, they spend money, they earned in EU, in EU, making Poland grow faster. Poland, that is stronger economically is better for EU. No?

Also, during WWII, Poles were also the biggest immigrant group in UK, and they were fighting for Brits. They are not heroes, they are morons. They should sit on their asses, because they got fucked after war anyway, so why risk lives- and even if Germans would win, and fuck Brits harder, that would mean less development and jobs today for immigrants. Win-win situation with your logic.

Just go out of EU if it is that difficult for you in a group.

And aside all of that, IF a German or Dutch, has to choose between Pole or German/Dutch, he will ALWAYS choose German/Dutch. And I do not blame them- German/Dutch language as mother tongue is always better, and supporting your own- it is fine! I also do not bitch about Germans getting more money for the same thing- I understand that, it is fine.

However, if you have vacancies, someone has to fill them, to make those companies earn money, so that lazy young fucks and or older retired people in your country can get their social money paid. 



&gt; if i ever meet a Pole like you here, i would make his life hell.

That says a lot of you as a person. 

I hope, that you would not meet an innocent person and stalk him.

I hope, that you will meet me in person.

&gt; lets see how you like it when 3 million Turks emigrate to Poland once Turkey joins the EU. i bet your nationalists will sing a different tune.

Anything, that would make ""my"" nationalist butthurt is good. They are fucked up, indeed. However, I doubt this could happen. Because they will die of starvation.

It is very funny, that you are so biased.

You know what? Ban polish workers. I really don't fucking care. And leave Poland alone- all of you. I mean really, no WWIII, stop invading us. No partitions, no nothing. Let us do our shit. We will deal with Russians alone, we always could, we only have problems, when we are gangbanged. So, no gangbangs, and we will be fine, k?

And you ban immigrants, remove social, work for more money, then watch Asian companies fucking up yours, because everything would cost way to much money to do it in Europe.

Yes, well this society preaches individual responsibility. If they don't want to, how's that our problem? It's not that they can't.

&gt; I actually like this idea but how are u going to verify they have indeed worked 45 years as most don't have complete provable records(like my dad or mom don't have this.)?

That's all being recorded already, try the UWV and they'll tell you all about where, when and how long you worked everywhere.

&gt; I said physical jobs because its a compromise i like the idea of everyone stopping at 65 but bouwvakers should be first inline.

Why should they be first in line? Because they don't want to do other jobs? We might as well let all people on welfare retire right away then.

&gt;The US wishes to reform the dispute settlement process to address its concerns from transparency to staffing issues.

&gt;Letting members of the AB continue to work on appeals even though their terms have expired has been one of the key issues for the US. “The US believes that there needs to be a legal basis to show that a person who has ceased to be a member of the AB should continue serving on an appeal,” according to a statement of the US at a recent meeting of the DSB in September in Geneva.

&gt;Thus as long as one member of the AB continued to serve despite the expiration of his or her term, the US is unwilling to consider the selection process for the other vacancies.  Only the DSB has the authority to decide whether that member should continue, the US has maintained.

641,"&gt; Thats what no Atom energy leads too.

Nope. It's what lignite being one of the cheapest sources of energy leads too. 

Contrary to the popular believe on this site coal hasn't actually replaced nuclear energy. 

In 2002, when Germany decided to phase out nuclear, Germany produced 498.63 TWh electricity

- 156.29 TWh electricity from nuclear
- 140.54 TWh from lignite
- 111.43 TWh from coal 
- 15.79 TWh from wind
- 0.20 TWh from solar
- 6.63 TWh were imported

In 2017 Germany produced 546.90 TWh electricity

- 72.16 TWh from nuclear (-84.13 TWh)
- 133.98 TWh from lignite (-6.56 TWh)
- 81.74 TWh from coal (-29.69 TWh)
- 103.65 TWh from wind (+87.86 TWh)
- 38.39 from solar (+38.19 TWh)
- 52.27 TWh being exported

The positive change in wind energy alone is larger than the loss of nuclear.

644,"Of course you hurt an innocent party; you hurt two innocent parties in fact:

- the prostitutes whose bread you incumber by making their clientele illegal. If I sell onions at a stand and the government says ""It is now illegal to buy unions but not to sell them"" then yeah I as an union seller am hurt.
- the clientele who can now no longer purchase the service they are interested in for the fee the free market decides

So yeah that's generally the case when you make a _voluntary transaction_ between a buyer and a seller illegal; you hurt both buyer and seller.

Now of course in some cases neither buyer nor seller are innocent like if both are knowingly dealing in stolen goods hence in that case it's illegal to knowingly purchase stolen goods and of course it should be illegal to purchase prostitution when you know the prostitute is a slave but apart from that by making it illegal you only punish the innocent.

This law is based upon the moralism that the prostitute is automtically a ""victim"" and it's a sexist one at that; yeah the law is written down sex-agnostically and that's good but we all know the genesis of the mentality is the idea that most prostitutes are female and that people are hyper-protective of female sexuality and it's based on the idea of ""females are unhappy when they aren't trading sex for a relationship and/or children""; no one worries about male prostitutes because people aren't trying to be moral guardians of male sexuality except in the opposite direction of that they mock those who don't have enough sex",Ende Zyne prostaat voelde dat het ghoedt was.,/r/europe/comments/9llmv3/prostitution_laws_in_europe/e782ses/,dat_heet_een_vulva,1538758159

Well, I say all the time that if a country isn't willing to do immigration, that they gotta take fertility extremely seriously.  Guess I can't complain on that front.

*thinks*

So that means that Hungary would be incentivizing highly-paid women the most to have children, rather than the common model of a fixed subsidy thst tends to incentivize low-paid women the most.  I wonder if it could have interesting secondary effects if it makes having a large family a status symbol.

Plus, current policy has us trying to delay births.  Is that for all women with 3+ children, or only those who have kids who are *currently* raising kids below 12 or some age?  Because if Hungary is handing out lifelong income tax exemptions for women once they complete their third kid…wow.  That instead incentivizes having three kids as soon as possible, then entering the workforce.  That's got huge potential impacts on society.  The feminist crowd might be interested.  The ""get mothers back into the workforce after raising kids"" thing is a priority for Japan right now, but this is throwing a lot more resources into it than Japan is.

That also, depending upon how they structure it, creates an incentive for the wife to have the kids, but then to go back to work as soon as possible after thr birth and be the breadwinner, and for men to be ""househusbands"" raising the kids if someone needs to stay home to do so.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9lmgbx/is_hungary_experiencing_a_policyinduced_baby_boom/e782v6p/,vokegaf,1538758225

678,"&gt; Wealth tax and inheritance tax is IMO more useful than income tax to control the rise of inequality and accumulation of the wealth in the hands of few.

Taxes shouldn't be designed with the goal of impoverishing your citizens. It's extremely fucked up and, unfortunately, that's still the principle idea behind our inheritance system in France.

Napoleon needed to weaken everyone but himself, noble and commoner alike, so the easiest way to do that was making the droit d'aînesse illegal. By heavily taxing estates at time of death then requiring the division of that estate among all the children rapidly and irreversibly weakened, well, pretty much everyone with anything.

Even outside of the draconian French system, very, very few families maintain wealth over the course of generations. It's the old shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves rule (1st generation builds the wealth, 2nd enjoys it, 3rd finishes squandering it and has to start over). 

Building generational wealth is extremely difficult even without the government trying to take everything. So I don't really think a strict inheritance tax is beneficial. I'd go so far as to say it's inherently unjust. ",,/r/europe/comments/9llojr/inequality_is_worse_than_we_know_the_superrich_do/e7838eq/,[deleted],1538758528

I remember reading multiple stories how someone wanted to USA but ended in Australia (or the other way?) or Argentina. Once away from Eastern bloc, they obeyed the authorities. It was during Cold war, after all, and they valued their lives.

862,"&gt; Malaysian labour productivity is significantly higher than neighbouring Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines or Vietnam due to a high density of knowledge-based industries and adoption of cutting edge technology for manufacturing and digital economy. According to the Global Competitiveness Report 2017, the Malaysian economy is the 23rd most competitive country in the world in the period of 2017–18.[19]

&gt; Malaysian citizens lead a much more affluent lifestyle compared to their peers in upper-middle income countries like Mexico, Turkey, and Brazil. This is due to a low national income tax, low cost of local food, transport fuel, household essentials, a fully subsidized single payer public-healthcare and comprehensive social welfare benefit with direct cash transfer.[20] With an income per capita of 28,681 PPP Dollars (2017 World Bank) or 10,620 nominal US Dollars, Malaysia is the third wealthiest nation in Southeast Asia after the smaller city-states of Singapore and Brunei.[21] Malaysia has a newly industrialised market economy, which is relatively open and state-oriented.[22][23] The Malaysian economy is highly robust and diversified with the export value of high-tech products in 2015 standing at US$57.258 billion, the second highest after Singapore in ASEAN.[24] Malaysia exports the second largest volume and value of palm oil products globally after Indonesia.[25]

I'm quite sure, yes. Of course your misguided sense of superiority over everybody else would kick in a high gear hearing of an Asian nation doing well, but to the more developed people this isn't really surprising.

882,"For those wondering what this is all about, the Dutch ruling cabinet (VVD [Liberals], CDA [Christian Democrats], D66 [Centrists], CU [Center-left Christians]) wants to cut taxes on dividend, which will cost the country 2 billion Euros every year and is supposed to attract multinationals to settle in the Netherlands. This is a widely unpopular plan, but it is something the VVD, the largest party in the cabinet, don't want to let go.

Meanwhile, a large majority of the population is against this plan, along with the entire opposition. They see this as a 2 billion gift to the rich at the cost of the taxpayer. Furthermore, there have been several events that put the validity of this plan into question. For example, a few investors in multinationals, including Unilever and Shell, have said on-record that they do not mind if dividend tax stays, it's not going to make them want to come to/stay in the Netherlands more than they already do (or don't, as it turns out). Which is important, because those two were mentioned by name by our PM when defending the tax cut.

This news is just another blow to the credibility of the plans. Our PM is still defending it tooth and nail though, even when other parties in the cabinet are starting to speak out against it as well.

These programmes are typically designed to complete secondary education in preparation for tertiary education or provide skills relevant to employment, or both.  
&gt;  
&gt;Across the EU the average number of pupils per teacher at upper secondary level in 2016 was 12.0, though the figures vary across EU Member States. The highest pupil-teacher ratios were in the Netherlands (17.9), Finland (17.2) and the United Kingdom (16.5). In contrast, the lowest ratios were in Lithuania (7.7), Malta (8.3) and Luxembourg (9.0).

There never was such a war. Syria was repressive but mostly stable and peacefull until the US started funnelling large amounts of weapons to ismlamic insurgents and calling them moderate rebels. Now Assad is fighting to regain control, such as sociaopathic dictarors do, but there is no sign that he is systematically exterminating groups. The insurgents do that, but the groups they are killing are groups most Syrians dislike and hence will not identify as.

989,"I actually don't care that it's from a source named like that. I read everything. Western or Eastern.

My problem is with double standards. Either I am going to read Ukraine Today and Russia Today, and accuse them both of bias, or I am not going to read either of them and accuse them both of bias. What however is happening today in the western world is that people shun the Russian media or Kremlin-funded media, saying they're ""inaccurate"" ""deceitful"" ""biased"", while they're reading Western media or Washington-funded media. An article reporting about something appeared in The Guardian? Independent? CNN? MSNBC? The New York Times? They're almost always identical in wording. Several times I've seen them omit certain information, releasing half-truths, suppressing something. That is why I actually read both sides. And, funnily enough, RT actually informs its readers about allegations from the US/West about Russia, sometimes doesn't refute these allegations and leaves an empty space for the reader to assume things, or tries to counter them with (mis?)information. So it gives the reader a position from both Russian and Western perspective. A very rare phenomenon in western news.

So I am either going to distrust and criticize both of them. Which isn't happening almost anywhere. r/worldnews is the biggest culprit. So much of bias it's cancerous. I am seeing a lot of bias here on this subreddit too, which is unfortunate but quite understandable given the current situation - no positive news whatsoever on this subreddit about Russia. Only hackusations, poisoning etc. This led me to writing the original comment. If I posted a Russian article on worldnews, it'd have 0 points due to the source. I think I am going to use RT at some point to see a reaction from the community.

And an answer to your question - no media are objective. They are controlled/funded. They are tools to spread information.

I can't look it up for myself because it's patently a lie. Also, where exactly are you getting that 20,000,000 number from? Germany has a population of 82 million. Of that, 62 million are ethnically German. A further 9 million of ethnicity from within the EU (mostly polish, italian or romanian) That brings us up to 71 million of 82 million, so your claim is having some problems.

Next we get to Africa, with 4.5 million people from the Middle East or Northern Africa (egypt etc.) and 450,000 from sub-saharan Africa. After that, there are 2 million people originating from Asia and a few hundred thousand each from America, Australia and whatnot.

So, there are actually around 5.5-6 million people you could consider as being from Africa, or 6-8 million if you are fucking stupid enough to include Asia as being part of Africa. That's less than 8.8% of the population.

I would not be surprised at all that it would be the new 70s for UK.

It's good that you don't want to leave, it shows that you have common sense. Something that has not been all that common in recent times.

But come on, we have been seeing how things have been going in UK recently. Brexit was a shock of course, but what is horrifying us, or at least the group of people I talk about these things, is your current state of disarray. 

UK used to be stable and quite predictable, right now we feel that we do not know who with whom we are dealing with anymore.

And I am sorry that our expressions of shock comes of hateful or bitter, it is nor intended to be that way at least from me. But there is no point in sugarcoating the truth either.

1282,"&gt; Populism relies on lack of education and information.

Not in any meaningful way. Most voters are not well informed about politics even when they vote for the ""right"" parties/ideas. Populism gets its main drive from dissatisfaction. EU carefully pondering things for a decade with no clear policy or action, when the population sees bad news happening about that same issue almost daily, is what is driving populism. The exact details are not important with politics, important is that the population can feel the issue is being taken care of and improving. The important point is, that approximate decisive action to address the issue is more important, than coming up with the perfect solution is. This is what populism is an answer to. It's to force an end to the indecisiveness, so some meaningful action is finally taken on the issue. 

The above is also why populism can be fickle. If the dissatisfaction is gone, there is no big issue to unite the voters anymore. They were unified by their dissatisfaction and not political ideals, so there is now more things pulling them apart than uniting them. On the other hand, if the party fails to push the issue that is the source of the dissatisfaction, the voters have no reason to keep voting for them. They can get the same inaction by voting for the non-populist parties that overall align better with their beliefs.",,/r/europe/comments/9lecg7/france_to_germany_stop_rightwing_populism_by/e777wrj/,DoubleSteve,1538717744

National governments are also lobbying for their local companies.

Well, you have European governments, European companies, and European citizens competing on each other. 

What you perceive as ""race to the bottom"" and why the French refused the European constitution was a way for Eastern European companies *to able to compete* against Western European companies and play in the same conditions. When Macron got his EU labour regulation the companies of smaller or less developed European countries got disadvantaged again (Portugal is not Eastern Europe for example). 

The EU's principle of subsidiary is very nice but there are elementar problems which need to be solved. The EU is just a crutch to get advantages for some EU members in some areas and for other EU members in other areas. The EU is insufficient to compensate market failures because the EU needs more ressources and more political integration and not only economic integration.

I've linked a few times to what happened when Italy tried a poster campaign:

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/02/italian-government-pulls-controversial-campaign-encouraging-wome/

&gt;Italy’s Health Minister has yanked a controversial campaign to encourage Italians to have more babies in advance of a government sponsored “Fertility Day.”
&gt;
&gt;The poster campaign aimed at boosting birth rate has been revoked after it immediately drew criticism as demeaning toward women and reminiscent of  fascist era propaganda depicting women as baby factories.
&gt;
&gt;“Fertility Day is an insult to everyone – those who cannot procreate and those who would like to but are working,” tweeted author Roberto Saviano.

-

&gt;Health Minister Beatrice Lorenzin was roundly criticised online, with Twitter users mocking the initiative with the hashtag #FertilityDay and politicians on both the left and right ridiculing the posters.

1402,"&gt; If you compare 718 to 1494 you'll see that the christian kingdoms went from small to encompassing the whole peninsula at the end of the day

That's totally true. 

But those 8th centuries you named, weren't really a Re-conquest or some planned military campaign that lasted for 800 years. It was more of a regular medieval war of expansion, where different Christians and Muslims territories fought among themselves, allied with each-other, etc. 

In 1494, the Christian Kingdoms encompassed the whole peninsula, but the Muslim 8 centuries presence also influenced those very kingdoms. Laws, language, institutions of those Christian Kingdoms were also based on the previous Muslim rulers. 

You can see it in modern Spanish language. The Spanish word for ""mayor"", is *alcalde*, which comes from Arabic اَلْقَاضِي‎ (al-qāḍī, literally “judge""). Spanish language has hundreds of words that come from Arabic. Another example is the expression ""I wish"" (*ojalá*), which is used everyday by Spaniards, comes from Arabic وشاء اللّٰه‎ (wa-šā’ allāh) (literally ""and may Alah will it"").

1441,"&gt; I believe that in last 200 years you briefly fight only against Poland and Hungary. On the other occasions you yielded.

Thats not true. We have fought quite a lot as part of AU. During WW1, Czechoslovak Legions controlled a significant part of Russia (through control over railroads, and they just wanted to go home). During 1920, there were numerous conflicts with other post-AU nations. During 1938, there were several minor conflicts with Hungary, Poland and Germany (and German minority). But if you count the existence of CSR from 1918 to 1938, thats just 20 short years to have any major conflict.

In your second post, you totally ignore the significant international pressure from major powers: Britain, France, even US and I am not counting Germany and the 3M German minority which formed maybe 20% of Czech Population and which was almost exclusively pro-Hitler.

And the political situation in 1938 and 1939 was quite different. The occupation of CSR even after sudeten were taken made quite a blow to the appeasement politics of other powers, as well as Hitler's continued arming of Germany.",,/r/europe/comments/9l97yy/poll_which_neighboring_nation_are_the_czechs_most/e76spp9/,Unicorn_Colombo,1538701569

As for the rest of violent crime: you can absolutely point out the difference between the efficacy of police forces. Dr do you think Third World countries are the safest ever, because they don't even have police statistics about violence? 

Another thing are the [differences in crime definitions](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19592372). Going by official statistics, Australia and Canada have 10-20 times more kidnappings relative to the population than Mexico and Colombia. Does that sound realistic to you? Only if you realize the 'kidnappers' are almost always divorced parents, late bringing their kids back from visitation and their resentful ex-spouses reporting them. 

Comparing crime levels between countries where you can't reasonably assume identically effective police work is very hard. But you can look at imprisonment rates: [Romania](http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/romania) jails people at a similar rate than France, and slightly less frequently than the UK.

1606,"Yeah they vote as states. If 51% of a state votes then all the votes in that state are cast for the that candidate. And smaller states have a bit more voting power per person.


Under the way the constitution was originally intended each congressional district would vote for an elector, and the electors would indirectly elect the president. But the constitution allowed states to choose how their electors were chosen so by the 20the century all the states had moved to the “voting as a state” method to maximize the impact of the state’s majority candidate. So the system has changed radically in 230 years, even though the constitutional language hasn’t changed

When you vote you technically vote for an elector, but all the electors pledge who they will vote for ahead of time so you’re really voting for the candidate. The electors’ names aren’t even on the ballot any more. It respects the constitution for all legal purposes, but the mechanics are way more like a popular vote nowadays because the states have made it that way.

**Conspiracy theory or legitimate concern?**

An important US think tank encouraged the development of bioweapons ""trained on certain genotypes"" that could become a ""useful tool of politics"". At the same time, the US is blocking the banning of biological weapons, searching for genetic samples of Russians through tenders and allegedly operating bioweapons laboratories in various countries near Russia. Finally, there is even a patent for a drone that can be used to spread biological weapons across enemy territory.

Unfortunately, the United States has always led the way in developing new and even more horrific weapons, so such reports should give us serious cause for concern. Let us think of nuclear weapons and their use against civilian targets, uranium ammunition, which with its ""deadly dust"" is responsible for increased deformities in newborns over a long period of time, defoliants in the Vietnam War, the consequences of which are still terrible for the people of Vietnam, or napalm in the Vietnam War. Should a biological weapon really be developed as a new ""useful tool of politics""?
The New American Century Think Tank

A study entitled ""Rebuilding America's Defenses - Strategy, Forces and Resources For a New Century"" was published in September 2000. Its signatories were important political thinkers of the United States, some of whom are still active today as advisors to the government. Perhaps the most important name could be Paul Wolfowitz's. Former World Bank President, advisor to George W. Bush and deputy to Donald Rumsfeld, important promoter of the ""war on terror"", which was intended to subject Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Lebanon, Somalia, Sudan and Iran to the hegemony of the United States. The document is guided by the goal of preventing any rival from ever being able to question the US military superiority or hinder the use of US military power.

If you take a closer look at the strategy recommendation of the think tank, you will see that a large proportion of the recommendations have found their way into US policy. For example, as far as the expansion of military bases is concerned, the upgrading of units within the USA, the modernisation and expansion of the navy, the missile defence shield and the increase in expenditure on the military in general. But the document that was supposed to influence the US governments' strategy for the next century also states on page 60:

An advanced form of biological warfare that 'targets' specific genotypes can transform biological warfare from the realm of terror into a politically useful tool.

**Why do the US need tissue samples from Russians?**

In 2017, it became known that the US Air Education and Training Command (AETC) had published a call for tenders and a contract to purchase RNA samples calling for tissue of ""Russian/European descent"". The information was publicly available in the US government tender pages. The samplers had to be healthy, samples from Ukraine were excluded.

Now one can assume that the training department of the Air Force was not the end user of the gene samples. Where they ultimately went, however, is unknown. What makes the whole thing even more questionable is the alleged establishment of a network of military bio labs in Georgia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, i.e. all countries bordering directly on Russia. Biological weapons are tempting for politicians who see war as an extension of politics. They have decisive advantages over nuclear weapons, for example: Only living targets are attacked, not plants, buildings, machines, ports, airports, etc.

Reports are circulating in Russia that the swine fever that bypassed southern Russia in 2012 was caused by a virus spread by the R. Lugar Center for Public Health Research in Tbilisi in a covert operation against Russia. In 2013, Russian state media reported that Gennady Onishchenko, the then head of the Consumer Protection Agency, suspected that the centre, which is linked to the US Army Medical Department's Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) and financed by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), was developing biological weapons. The Russian Foreign Ministry also expressed concern about the ""biological activities of the Pentagon near the Russian border.

**""Why does the Biological Laboratory of the USA need frozen blood samples?**

In 2018, the Bulgarian investigative journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva took a closer look at this ""health centre"". A courageous woman who had already reconstructed in detail the route of arms deliveries to Syrian terrorists on the basis of the documents left behind by terrorists (13), and lost her job in return. She writes on her website:

The US embassy in Tblisi transports frozen human blood and pathogens as diplomatic cargo for a secret US military program. Internal documents according to which US diplomats carry out transports and experiments with pathogens under diplomatic protection were leaked to me by Georgian insiders. According to these documents, Pentagon scientists were brought to the Republic of Georgia and given diplomatic immunity to investigate deadly diseases and biting insects at the Lugar Center, the Pentagon's bio laboratory in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi.
    Dilyana Gaytandzhieva 

The report contains statements from local residents, allegations of experiments allegedly carried out at night, evidence of waste and a rigid response and warnings to the journalist. The Georgian government denied and claimed that the laboratory was under his control. What seems strange is that the US buys practically all the equipment it needs itself and requires a high security clearance to enter the facility.
Patent on a drone for the proliferation of bioweapons

In 2014, S. Mill Calvert patented an aircraft to spread toxic mosquitoes. The abstract states:

The device for releasing mosquitoes includes an unmanned aircraft that can be controlled by remote control. It carries a container with a processor unit and a container with mosquito hatch, which is a sealed housing for mosquitoes with mosquito food containing poison that can be transmitted via mosquito bites after the mosquitoes have ingested the food. A sufficiently sized release tube is connected to the container to release the mosquitoes from the incubator. A flap is connected to the tube and can be operated by remote control so that when it is opened, the mosquitoes have free passage to leave the container via the tube.

A German-speaking blogger found out that there is no S. Mill Calvert in the USA. However, 42 other military inventions have already been patented under the same name, including one that describes a special ammunition for the generation of strokes (12). He concludes that the name could be a pseudonym for a division of the US military.
USA and lack of respect for conventions

Most countries in the world have signed the Chemical Weapons Convention. The USA is also a signatory. It obliges the signatory states to completely eliminate all chemical weapons stocks and facilities for the production of such weapons. The USA signed the treaty on 13 January 1993 and ratified it on 25 April 1997.

However, the country has not yet made any attempt to destroy its stocks and facilities. Official reason: No budget available for it. This means that the USA has not fulfilled its obligations under the Treaty for over 20 years. The same applies to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which provides for an obligation to disarm. Instead, the nuclear arsenal is to be modernised, made more targeted and more effective.

If one looks at these experiences with signed treaties or conventions, one can get the impression that the blocking of a Biological Weapons Convention was certainly due to reasons connected with the development of biological weapons.

If one looks at these experiences with signed treaties or conventions, one can get the impression that the blocking of a Biological Weapons Convention was certainly due to reasons connected with the development of biological weapons.

The use of biological or chemical weapons was prohibited by the Geneva Protocol under international law since 1925, but such weapons were used by the Japanese army in the Second World War. Also the use of defoliants by the USA in the Vietnam War, which led to hereditary damage on a large scale, can be regarded as the use of chemical weapons, which is denied by the USA. Following the Chemical Weapons Convention, the UN General Assembly decided to launch a Convention against Biological Weapons. It has been signed since 1972 and entered into force in 1975. However, the treaty does not provide for any concrete agreements on arms control; additional protocols to cure this were not concluded. To make it clear once again: Negotiations on internationally binding monitoring of the Protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention, which provides for international inspections of installations by an independent organisation, took place between 1995 and 2001. The US refused to support the efforts. Their refusal to become part of the verification mechanism makes any attempt to activate the Convention futile (the USA reject the Additional Protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention). The USA is now supposed to maintain bioweapons laboratories in 25 countries. Whether this is a conspiracy theory or not could very easily be verified if the US took the Biological Weapons Convention seriously and agreed to an additional protocol for verification.
History of the Richard Lugar Health Center

In 2013, Chinese Air Force Colonel Dai Xu accused the US government of creating a new variant of avian influenza that had infected China. In his opinion, the US military had deliberately released the H7N9 variant of the bird virus in China. In 2014 it was reported (translation) that the source of the Ebola virus in West Africa should also come from US weapon laboratories. And the interviewee who made the allegations at the time was not a conspiracy theorist, but a university lecturer and a leading specialist in biological warfare and terrorism, Professor Francis A. Boyle. Boyle.

In 2015, Nikolai Patrushev, head of the Russian Security Council, warned of the threat posed by biological weapons laboratories established in the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) areas, highlighting in particular the Richard G. Lugar Center in Georgia.

In February 2018, ""The Commonwealth"" reported that the Lugar Center had already been equipped in 2014 with a special facility where insects could be bred to enable the sandfly project in Georgia and the Caucasus. In 2014 and 2015, the bites of sand flies sucking blood caused fever. According to the source, the Pentagon was also very interested in investigating tularemia, an often fatal infectious disease in rodents. The disease is similar to the plague and often affects hares and wild rabbits.

In January 2016, 20 Ukrainian soldiers died of swine fever in just two days in Kharkov, where one of the Pentagon's bio-laboratories is located. 200 were treated in hospital. The Government of Ukraine did not report the deaths. By March of the same year, 364 people died in Ukraine from influenza (81.3% of cases were caused by the virus (H1N1) pdm09), a variant that had caused the swine fever epidemic of 2009.

In 2017, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine confirmed 90 new cases, 8 of which were fatal from poisoning with the toxin botulinum toxin, one of the most dangerous biological toxins of all. According to local health authorities, food poisoning is the cause of the epidemic.

1834,"**A look at Novichok**

The nerve poison ""Novichok"", which was allegedly used as Russia's murder weapon in England in the Skripal case, had been developed in the former Soviet Union, but not in Russia. The US was instrumental in ""cleaning up"" the chemical weapons of the Soviet Union, including the facilities where the poison was first developed. Then it was patented in 2009 in the USA (US patent 9,132,135 B2) and apparently also produced there.

One of the co-inventors, who migrated to the USA, wrote a book about it, with all the details, most secret services, including Germany (and obviously also Great Britain) had patterns of the poison. Nevertheless, the British government and echote the German government claimed that only Russia could be considered for the ""poison attack"". A conspiracy theory that stands on shakier legs than the thesis of the bioweapons production of the USA. Nevertheless, sanctions have been imposed on Russia, not on the US.
Russia is worried

Russia seems to be seriously concerned. The topic is discussed on Russian television and an article on the thesis can be found in Russian international media almost every week. On 25 September Sputnik, a Russian state news agency, writes again about ""US bio labs in Georgia: secret diplomatic mail and no access even for Georgians"". (Jochen Mitschka)

1903,"&gt;obviously I am misled by the media into believing how good the Russians are at hacking and manipulating, interfering and generally disrupting western politics, and cyber security, either they are total dumb asses or extremely successful, its so hard to know.

I don't think it's one or the other. I think Russia's shown that they certainly aren't bad at what they're doing. As the US can attest (or should...but won't) the Russians did a pretty brilliant job at interfering and moving the needle of public opinion. The more important part though, is that fabricating misinformation takes time, resources and people. That's more potential for the fabrication to become known itself. 

I'm sure it's possible that they worked on covering things, but at the same time, you probably can't safely assume that they know everything the way it really was, so you might have to tailor your public messages to make sure everyone's on the same page, and that it's fitting to what is being said specifically by the other side.

More importantly, they might just want to keep a list of who knows what. Should push come to shove, you can either take them down personally by hacking them and releasing anything found, fabricating stories about the people who are in the know to use as leverage to gain silence, or just to assassinate them if you're old fashioned.

As an individual, not a statistic, per capita GDP is just as meaningless, I might be an utter fuckup or a highly successful person. Even if I'm perfectly average, differences in income inequality is a thing.

&gt; Are you responsible for political affairs ?

Most of us aren't, but still get affected by them. As illustrated by my example. Being threatened by Russia (ok, we're used to that and don't care because we're in NATO) or the USA is not a joke, being threatened by Armenia or Singapore is, because of the weight of the country behind the threat.

&gt; Lithuania is safe and we spend 2,5 of total gdp 

That's precisely my point. And maybe why you're uncomfortable acknowledging it. What's keeping you safe is NATO and its huge military, supported by huge total GDPs. You could spend 50% of your GDP and be defenceless.

Here's another example of total GDP making sense in individual choices: Belgium and France have about the same per capita values (or the difference is tiny seen from down here).

1939,"&gt;Apart from the different borders, the name, the flag, it's government type.

The United Kingdom didn't become a new state when Ireland became independent in and the name changed from United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The United States of America didn't become a new state when Hawaii joined in 1959 (which also changed the flag). Spain didn't become a new state when they changed their constitutional order from a republic to a monarchy in 1978.

&gt;I don't think any of those being different means it could be considered the same state.

I am pretty sure that there is a broad consensus both between historians and legal scholars that it is the same state. I think you will find that international bodies treat it as the same state and that the German constitutional court has confirmed this. 

Taking a look at the the relevant documents like the Treaty of Versailles, the Weimar Constitution of the German Empire, the Potsdam Agreement, the 2+4 Treaty etc they all did not abolish nor did they establish a new state.

&gt;I mean why not go all the way back to 1521 when the HRE was renamed the ""Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation"".

The HRE was not a nation state.

Oooh I can answer this!

So ethnically Chinese people are Yellow - and yes, they call themselves this.

This is because they are the Children of the Yellow Emperor, who is venerated as the first Emperor of China and an originator of Chinese culture (or something like this.  The guy has a birth story similar to Jesus, complete with a flash of light and a virgin pregnancy).  So yes, ethnically Chinese people are proud of being yellow.

1975,"&gt; Historically while there's evidence of Chinese presence, it's also unlikely the Chinese has exclusive use and control over the islands.

Of course they didn't, the South China Sea was and is one of the world's busiest sea lanes, and has been sailed by ships from all the countries bordering it (and many that don't border it) for millennia. And there is no evidence that the Chinese ever lived on or claimed ownership of the islands themselves. Most of those islands could not have supported human populations before the 20th century. Even China's own historical pre-20th century maps all show Hainan as China's southernmost territory. It's a travesty that China claims sole ownership of 90% of this international body of water.

&gt; Thats pedantic. Perhaps ""inherit"" doesn't have the right connotation since it implies the total ceasing of the prior party. But in this case we can think of the ROC as ceasing being the internationally recognized ""China"".

What's pedantic about it? The Chinese love to use that word, ""inherit"" in this instance, since it makes their case sound stronger. But when called out on it, they can't explain why. How could the PRC inherit a claim from a government that they don't even consider legitimate? That's hypocrisy.

&gt; Or maybe it's more accurate to think that they inherited it from Imperial Japan: since the Japanese put the Spratly Islands under the administration of Taiwan, and when it returned Taiwan to China following the war, China ""inherits"" the Spratly from Japan as part of Taiwan?

Source? I'm wondering what you mean by Japan putting the islands under Taiwan.

&gt; There's three accounts of the battle. Context helps too, the battle took place in a disputed territory claimed by 3 countries in 1988, but let me guess, you think only China is ever in the wrong?

I could just as easily say that you think only China is ever right.

It's ridiculous that you equate the level of Chinese aggression to that of the other claimants. Unless you're not arguing in good faith you'll agree that Chinese actions far outstrip all the other claimants put together.

And this ""context"" that you don't mention doesn't change the fact that the Chinese were the aggressors, and they killed Vietnamese soldiers in a battle that wasn't even part of a declared war.",,/r/europe/comments/9kzzzx/the_countries_with_the_most_unesco_world_heritage/e75kz2b/,New_Katipunan,1538664767

2007,"&gt;Well I assumed they (member countries) all need to accept the deal, because that is exactly what was the case with Canada for instance.

That's why I said 'it depends'. Essentially it depends on what is covered. The EU can make agreements within its own competencies, but need permission if it exceeds them. The EU has in the past had a bit of a tendency to go beyond its competencies and then get permission from members.  But the whole EU exit thing is a bit more complicated as it potentially covers more than one agreement..

You basically have a few different things. First there is the exit agreement, which is about defining the UK/EU relationship as defined by Article 50, the rules on that are in the article:

*That agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with Article 218(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It shall be concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.*

So QMV. 

A comprehensive EU/UK trade deal could well end up going beyond the competencies of the EU, arguably the exit agreement could to, at that point member states would have to consent.  Obviously a limited agreement would be easier and quicker and simply require consent from the EP and members states under the QMV arrangements.

&gt;EU can't accept your request to choose parts of the single market, if it did, there would be no more EU.

I absolutely agree, it'd be insane for the UK to ask to retain bits of the single market, and stupid for the EU to agree. There are no circumstances where that makes sense.  However, the UK is not asking to retain bits of the single market. It has been very explicit that it intends to leave the single market.

&gt;If that is your approach then you will inevitably end up without any deal.

Indeed, which is why it is not doing so.

Again, the UK has asked for an agreement on trade in goods (so essentially an FTA), it hasn't even pushed for a deal on all goods (but rather goods in relation to the UK/Ireland border..), nor has it pushed for anything on services.

&gt;You talk about UK taking advantage of her ""positive attributes"", can you name them qnd explain why aren't you able to benefit from them being in the EU? 

This comes down to how the EU operates. As a union, the EU has to take into account the needs of every member, and quite rightly so. As a result EU trade agreements have in the past been used to protect the interests of member states in a way that the UK wouldn't need to (think agricultural products the UK doesn't grow, or even things like cheap steel, where the UK has shifted to complex metallurgy and benefits from cheap international steel..). The EU also hasn't focused on services to the extent that the UK would prefer, the interal EU market on service is still fragmented and it hasn't been a focus for external agreements.

&gt;One can obviously argue that once they are out of customs union they can forge deals of their own, but I honestly believe that pure matter of scale benefit UK (just like any other country) being inside of the trading block, rather than negotiating on its own with giants like US or even growing China.

The benefits of scale are reduced by the lack of tailoring. It's basically swings and roundabouts. Being one voice in 28 in the context of trade is one thing, but speaking as one voice on your own issues has its own benefits. Throw in that the EU has historically been both slow and somewhat messy in concluding trade agreements (see the drama over the Canadian deal now, and the potential drama over the Japanese deal.) so that benefit of scale comes with the problem of having to keep a large block of countries happy.

Moreover, the UK isn't a small country, people often say '1 in 28' but economically it is 20% of the union (1 in 5) much as Germany or France aren't 1 in 28 economically.. It is as important to the rest of the EU in trade terms as the US is, and it is a top 10 economy globally. If the UK were Poland, or Hungary, it'd be a very, very different prospect, but as it is, the UK is large enough to be attractive outside of the EU.

2009,"&gt;Farage: We have no links to Russia.

&gt;ZEIT ONLINE: You didn't meet with the Russian Embassy's deputy chief-of-mission in London?

&gt;Farage: Nope.

&gt;ZEIT ONLINE: Not in 2013, before the Brexit campaign was conceived?

&gt;Farage: Ah, hang on. He came to the EP office. Or I met with him in London. So what?

&gt;ZEIT ONLINE: Why did you meet with him?

&gt;Farage: I think you are a nutcase! You are really a nutcase! Brexit is the best thing to happen: for Russia, for America, for Germany and for democracy. And that's the key point.

&gt;*Farage's press spokesman again interrupts the interview. He says that the interview should focus more on trade relations between Germany and the UK. Farage nods.*

&gt;Since most of the border defenses were located in the territory ceded as a consequence of the Munich Agreement, the remaining part of Czechoslovakia was entirely open to further invasion, despite having relatively large stockpiles of modern weaponry. In a speech delivered in the Reichstag, Hitler expressed the importance of the occupation for strengthening of German military, noting that by occupying Czechoslovakia, Germany gained 2,175 field guns and cannons, 469 tanks, 500 anti-aircraft artillery pieces, 43,000 machine guns, 1,090,000 military rifles, 114,000 pistols, about a billion rounds of small-arms ammunition and three million rounds of anti-aircraft ammunition. This amount of weaponry would be sufficient to arm about half of the then Wehrmacht.[72] Czechoslovak weaponry later played major part in the German conquest of Poland and France, the latter country having urged Czechoslovakia to surrender to Germany in 1938. 

Also, [there was a plot to remove Hitler,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement#Reactions) that was scuppered by Chamberlain's cowardice.

&gt;Before the Munich Agreement Hitler's determination to invade Czechoslovakia on 1 October 1938 had provoked a major crisis in the German command structure. The Chief of the General Staff, General Ludwig Beck, protested in a lengthy series of memos that it would start a world war that Germany would lose, and urged Hitler to put off the projected war. Hitler called Beck's arguments against war ""kindische Kräfteberechnungen"" (""childish force calculations""). On 4 August 1938, a secret Army meeting was held. Beck read his lengthy report to the assembled officers. They all agreed something had to be done to prevent certain disaster. Beck hoped they would all resign together but no one resigned except Beck. His replacement, General Franz Halder, sympathised with Beck and they both conspired with several top generals, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris (Chief of German Intelligence), and Graf von Helldorf (Berlin's Police Chief) to arrest Hitler the moment he gave the invasion order. This plan would only work if Britain issued a strong warning and a letter to the effect that they would fight to preserve Czechoslovakia. This would help to convince the German people that certain defeat awaited Germany. Agents were therefore sent to England to tell Chamberlain that an attack on Czechoslovakia was planned, and of their intention to overthrow Hitler if this occurred. The proposal was rejected by the British Cabinet and no such letter was issued. Accordingly, the proposed removal of Hitler did not go ahead.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/9l6p44/no_caption_necessary/e75dc28/,Canal_Volphied,1538657586

2129,"&gt; So, when I said the whole thing about ""if it's racist, you can fuck off with that bullshit, that's a justifiable problem"" did you think that counted calling civilisations the apex of human achievement or no. Because. It's still racism.

How is calling a civilization (or in this case, elements of it) apex of human accomplishment racist? Civilization is a set of beliefs, values, practices, ways of organizing society, government, culture. If a country/civilization does something really well (say Japan and low crime rate), how is that not worthy of praise or acknowledgement? They came up with a set of values and practices that dissuade of people from preying on each other in order to get ahead which makes life better for society. Is that not better than Russia and its criminal underworld running a huge part of society? If one way of doing things is better than the other, is it wrong to point that out? 

Also what does any of that have to do with race at all? That seems like a non sequitur. Values and practices have nothing to do with genes.

&gt;So the Summers person basically just suggested that biology, as opposed to society, is the most culpable factor for not hiring women in high-powered positions. I can't see why anyone would have an issue with an idea that insinuates that discrimination isn't a problem, and that women are excluded from high-powered jobs because of something inherently different about them, and not because of social stigma. Nope, no reason to get annoyed about that.

**Different socialization and patterns of discrimination in a search[37]** Did you not read this part? He's saying that discrimination does exist but doesn't explain entirety of the differences. Are you saying there are no differences whatsoever between men and women? There are differences in interests, temperament, etc. That doesn't mean men are X and women are Y, it means men are more likely to express X traits and women are more likely to express Y traits. There's a big overlap because we're the same species, obviously. 

&gt;These two are perfect examples. On the surface, they express a basically reasonable idea, that cultures are different, or that men and women are different, but then they take that to a twisted place, and start saying that there's certain cultures that have reached the ""apex"" of what humanity is supposed to be, or that women are biologically stopped from getting high-powered jobs, and that discrimination and social stigma and inertia is more of a reinforcement of something that is, the author seems to be saying, an inherently justified bias.

Certain cultures do things better than others. And some do it better than all the others. What is wrong with that statement? 

Women aren't ""biologically stopped"", just **less likely** to pursue high powered careers due to different preferences (women on average score higher on wanting more work-life balance which means you can expect women to be involved at lower rate in pursuing careers which wreck work-life balance. There's nothing controversial about that statement, you can check any poll on that. Women who do want that can and do achieve it all the time. You're also assuming life wrecking high powered careers to be something inherently good, which is not. I'm glad there are people out there who do it but most people don't. Most men also don't pursue those kinds of careers, just like most women. But of the tiny percentage of people willing to do those kinds of jobs, majority are men. So what? As long as anyone who wants to do it can do it, differential outcomes are irrelevant.

&gt;And even when people aren't specifically going further than ""men and women are different,"" can you blame someone who might have been told their whole life that men and women were different, which was followed up each time by ""[this means/because] women are inferior"" for biting your head off a bit prematurely? Again, they are the extreme and the minority, but that doesn't mean they have no reasons for being angry.

Nobody says women are inferior because there are fewer female CEOs. That is your conclusion because you at some level associate that position with worth it does not have. A person's worth as a human being is not measured by a job their do. Sweeping streets and educating kids in kindergarten is absolutely essential for maintenance of our society.

You're exactly the kind of person I was calling out earlier, no offense. You take a very shallow look at something and think that just because something *sounds* racist or sexist, it must be and you don't bother to look further. I can link you a bunch of psychological literature if you're interested in learning about differences between sexes. Those differences aren't big but they do cause significant differences in outcomes due to large differences at tails of the distribution (men are slightly taller than women but among tallest 1% of people, almost all are men)",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/9kyzbb/austria_ridiculed_for_plan_to_ban_extremist_hand/e757u1v/,Charminng,1538649992

2186,"DeepL translation: 

&gt;On 13 April, the Dutch military intelligence service MIVD prevented a hacking attack by the Russian secret service on the OPCW, the organisation against the spread of chemical weapons in The Hague. The Russians are said to have tried to hack into the OPCW's Wi-Fi network.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Four Russian officers involved were expelled the same day. They had to leave their belongings behind and according to the MIVD there was equipment in it that is used to hack with. The Russians had travelled to the Netherlands on 10 April with a diplomatic passport.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;MH17  
&gt;  
&gt;The laptop of one of the Russian officers connected with several countries, including Malaysia. The Russians may have tried to gain insights into the international investigation into the MH17 disaster.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Minister Bijleveld of Defence is proud of the work of the security service. She calls on the Russians to stop secret cyber operations and the cabinet has summoned the Russian ambassador.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Director Eichelsheim of the MIVD said that it is unusual for his service to bring out such news in detail, but that the Americans will come out this afternoon with a complaint against various Russian intelligence officers. The cabinet hopes that by bringing out this operation the international operation of the Russians will also be made difficult.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Eichelsheim also said that the Russian secret service is active in the Netherlands because many international organisations are based here.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;At a press conference in The Hague, the names and functions of the four Russian intelligence officers who would be involved in the attack were announced.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Aleksey Sergeyvich Morenets - 'cyber operator'.

&gt;Cyber attacks  
&gt;  
&gt;This morning, the British Government reported that the Russian secret service is behind a series of global cyber-attacks designed to undermine Western democracies.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""They are trying to undermine and influence elections in other countries,"" said Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt in a statement. ""Together with our allies, we will respond to these attempts by the GROe secret service to undermine international stability.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;At the beginning of the afternoon, the Russians dismissed these accusations of cyber attacks as fantasies.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;The Dutch intelligence services also made the news in January with a success. It was then announced that they played an important role in the ongoing FBI investigation into Russian influence on the American elections.

2198,"&gt; Brussels has launched disciplinary and legal action against Poland, and asked the European Court of Justice to suspend a law pushing some supreme court judges into earlier retirement,

Ekhem - it is done already - since July they are retired.

They don't have anything to secure now.

Judges attempted to suspend that law - but they do not have such right in Polish system.

The case is closed - just some people refuse to acknowledge it and try to use TSUE to pry it open - it will not result in returning of those judges though.

More than that - any judge returned like that would get a label of ""Brussels lapdog"" - it would undermine judicary position in Poland even further.

All government would have to do is to instigate protests aggainst judges and not caliming them down - because ""they are not Polish judges"".

Bartlomiej Przymusinski did not expect his job to bring him an appearance at a rock festival followed by a closed-door disciplinary tribunal. But the Polish commercial court judge has found himself in both the public spotlight and the shadows of Poland’s battle over the administration of justice.

Mr Przymusinski was one of several judges at the Pol’and’Rock Festival this summer, at a time of street protests and European concern over Warsaw’s overhaul of the judicial system. He and other judges slept in tents, made temporary tattoos that said “Free People, Free Courts” and spoke on the rule of law and civic freedoms alongside the main music stage.

But last month, Mr Przymusinski and two other festival-going judges were unexpectedly summoned to a disciplinary hearing. They were told to testify as witnesses and warned that revealing details could be a criminal offence.

Polish media reports have suggested the hearing was about judges “surpassing the limits of the freedom of speech, while making public statements about other judges and representatives of constitutional bodies”. The judges were asked about their festival appearance and their public criticism of the government’s judicial reforms, the reports said.

“The whole experience was very painful, unpleasant, and in my opinion, completely unnecessary. I was stunned by the fact that I have to testify in a case concerning other judges. I still don’t know what the aim of the interrogation was,” Mr Przymusinski, who is also the spokesman for Iustitia, the Polish judges’ association, told the Financial Times.

“It’s a shame that the disciplinary proceedings against me might not at all concern my performance.”

Adam Bodnar, Poland’s ombudsman, has started an official inquiry into disciplinary actions against judges and warned of a “chilling effect” on public debate.

Poland’s overhaul of its judiciary has emerged as one of the most contentious issues in European politics, pitting the Law and Justice government, which insists on its right to remodel its justice system, against domestic and international critics who fear the rule of law is being eroded.

Brussels has launched disciplinary and legal action against Poland, and asked the European Court of Justice to suspend a law pushing some supreme court judges into earlier retirement, saying it had to prevent “irreparable damage” to the country’s judicial system.

The government insists it is improving a judicial system insufficiently reformed after the fall of communism. But its many domestic critics, including judges, as well as the EU, argue that this is just an excuse to take control of the judiciary.

Warsaw’s reforms include taking over the National Council of the Judiciary, a body responsible for guarding the independence of judges and disciplinary proceedings, and giving the justice minister control. The disciplinary hearings are seen by those opposing the changes as a tool to silence rebellious judges.

Another judge to have faced disciplinary proceedings is Arkadiusz Krupa, a judge in Lobez, a town of 10,000 in north-west Poland, who is well-known for publishing satirical drawings about the judiciary on his Facebook page called “The Blind Eye of Themis”, in reference to the Greek goddess of justice.

The disciplinary court opened an investigation against him and asked his superiors to send a performance review and his case law from the past three years.

Mr Krupa told the Financial Times: “This is all very Kafkaesque. I don’t know what is the aim of the investigation, and why — if I am accused of surpassing the limits of freedom of speech — the disciplinary court needs to see all the cases I handled during the past three years. I am no activist: I just like to point out the absurdities of the system that we are living in.”

Judge Ewa Maciejewska was also summoned to a disciplinary hearing after asking the ECJ whether the new disciplinary procedure threatened judicial independence.

“I have been a judge in the civil cases for the last 20 years and it is the first time that I have been summoned by the disciplinary officer,” said Ms Maciejewska, who, like the other interrogated judges, was a teenager when Poland’s communist era ended in 1989.

The National Council for the Judiciary declined to comment on the disciplinary proceedings. Michal Wojcik, vice-minister of justice, said last month that “judges want to be politicians at the same time”, and that “these two cannot be reconciled”.

However, Jacek Dubois, lawyer for another judge who has faced a disciplinary hearing, points out that the ECJ has recently ruled — in the case of Andras Baka, former president of Hungary’s supreme court — that members of the judiciary have the right and the duty to comment on changes that might affect the rule of law.

Mr Dubois said he believed the interrogation of his client — Igor Tuleya, a district court judge in Warsaw — was illegal.

“At this stage of pre-disciplinary procedure, a judge can be convened to give a voluntary written or spoken statement, but not to testify. Mr Tuleya and others were convened as witnesses — in my opinion, as a way to force them to testify against themselves. And this goes against basic European legal standards,” said Mr Dubois.

“My client was questioned about deeds that until recently were seen as honourable. Either the disciplinary officer has a completely different view of reality, or the goal was to let the judges know that they are being watched and that certain actions are undesirable.”

Mr Przymusinski, who says he has never hidden a critical approach towards the reforms implemented by Law and Justice, has said he will not be silenced. He believes the government is deliberately looking for something to hold over the heads of judges, “in the spirit of the old rule: give us a man, and we will find the crime”.

2249,"&gt; In 2015 UK began to promote Brexit, great Britain exiting EU. They marketed it as being safer and more stable to live alone again.

The UK didn't do anything of the sort in 2015. The government and the opposition both maintained a pro-Europe stance. It was the growth of UKIP around that time that then pushed David Cameron into offering a referendum in 2016, but Cameron himself, and most of his cabinet, as well as most of the opposition, still supported remaining in the EU and actively campaigned on that right up until June 2016; you would not have heard Cameron, or May trying to 'promote' Brexit until after the referendum. 

Of course once the referendum happened then Cameron had to go and May had to change tack - but even now she can't bring herself to say it'll be good for Britain, only that we will 'make a success of it' - i.e. despite it being a shit idea I reckon we'll be OK.

Right-wing politicians started to call it an attack on the Church, on Christian values (they couldn't see the movie yet) and even banned it in some towns or delayed it. 

The result is that after it's first weekend it broke all-time records in number of views (almost million views) and it already made profit. You can hardly buy a ticket for an evening screening if you don't want to sit right in front if you didn't make a reservation a few days before.

Let me stress that this was not a situation such as the Vietnam war were the soldiers were forced to fight and the majority of the people were against the war. We know for a fact that these views were very widespread throughout German society. No I am not forgetting the effect of propaganda but you are forgetting that it was also regular authors, before the nazi party, who would spread antisemitism, from which the nazi actually got there ideology from regular teachers, and regular people who would expose Jews, attack them on the streets in pogroms, Hundreds of years of antisemitism and practices of ethnic clenching going back to the German empire. And if they were effected by the propaganda, in other words accepted the view of Jews as subhuman,  than they did adhere to the ideology of their country. And those that were not drafted helped away from the battle field, in pogroms. So propaganda is not an excuse. People lie to others yes, but you still have to retain some common sense. The ""but not all"" is not a good excuse because there is always the exception to in any group. Lets say you are right, what about actual nazi party members, can we agree they were anti semitic? According to you no, because there were infact some nazis that helped Jews. Now what about the **SS** , they were *the Jew hunters* surely if someone was an SS member we can call them antisemitic? No? there also was an SS member that helped jews. What about ISIS, can I not say ISIS fighters are religious fanatics? They force people to fight. 

Im sorry if I have trouble viewing nazi soldiers as individuals during an extremely nationalistic era when they declared they are **one superior monolith** , im just treating them the way they wanted as a group.

First there is the fact that of course the vast majority of Palestinians are Sunni Muslims, so to the extent that they have any particular conflict it is predominantly with Sunni not Shiite Muslims.

Second, Israelis have never cared about their neighbors politics beyond their own security considerations. Historically they have been closer to Shiite nations (Iran under the Shah) or Sunni nations (Egypt today) as a function of basically how much those nations have wanted to destroy and hinder them.

Third, Sunni nations like Syria also have notoriously poor relationships with Israel. Again because they actively work to harm Israel and Israeli interests (see last point)

Basically Israel is willing to ""get along"" with anyone who is willing to stop actively calling for their destruction, whether they be Shiite, Sunni or anything else.

""Some states soothe their citizens in troubled times. Others prefer not to sugar-coat things. “A larger European conflict could start with an attack on Sweden,” warned the most recent report of the country’s defence commission. Electricity would be limited. Calorie intake would fall. Tens of thousands might be wounded. This was not idle talk: in June, all 22,000 Swedish volunteer soldiers were called up for the largest surprise exercise since 1975. For the first time in almost 30 years, the government has written to millions of households exhorting them to prepare for the worst. “We will never give up,” warned leaflets decorated with vivid tableaux of burning buildings and rolling tanks.


Sweden’s aim is to hold out for three months, until help arrives. These twin tasks—becoming “indigestible to Russia”, as one analyst puts it, and ensuring that the cavalry shows up—will be high on the agenda of whichever government emerges from the hung parliament produced by the election of September 9th. Sweden may not be a member of NATO. But under Stefan Lofven, Sweden’s Social Democratic prime minister for the past four years, it has manoeuvred as close to the alliance as it is possible to get from the outside. By deferring the question of outright membership, anathema to the left, he created political space to tighten Sweden’s triple embrace of America, NATO and its neighbours. A landmark “host nation” agreement with NATO was steered through parliament in 2016. America’s potential wartime role in Sweden was once a state secret; now contingency plans can be made openly.


This is not just for Sweden’s benefit. Thousands of NATO troops were sent to the Baltic states last year to serve as tripwires in case of any Russian aggression. In a war, they would need swift and massive reinforcement. But the overland route runs through the Suwalki Gap, a choke point with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad on one side and Russia’s ally Belarus on the other. It would be easier to send backup through Sweden and over the Baltic Sea. That is one reason why Gotland, a bucolic Swedish island in the middle of those waters, has assumed such importance. Were Russia to seize it the sea route might also become perilous. Last year’s Aurora exercise, involving the largest ever American force on Swedish soil, simulated attacks on Gotland. In January, Sweden re-established a military unit there, its first new regiment since the second world war.

Sweden is also cosying up to its neighbours. It agreed to swap defence attachés with Norway last year, and to share data on air surveillance—particularly Russian bombers on the prowl. It has gone further with Finland, agreeing to form a “partially integrated” Finnish-Swedish air force and operating a joint naval group that lets Finnish admirals command Swedish vessels, and vice versa. Niklas Granholm of FOI, Sweden’s defence research agency, notes that Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian fighter pilots are on a first-name basis after weekly air exercises in the High North. He suggests this could be turned into a “strike force for the entire Nordic-Baltic region”.

Whether the Social Democrats cling to power or are ousted by the centre-right Moderates in the coming months, a consensus has taken hold. “We are realising that Crimea was not a passing storm, but climate change,” says Anna Wieslander, director of the Swedish Defence Association, referring to Russia’s annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014. One left-wing MP milling around Sweden’s parliament, the Riksdag, is glum. “Nothing will change,” he complains of the election. “Everyone hates Russia.”

In fact, Sweden’s political direction will have important implications for defence. The four opposition parties that governed until 2014, including the Moderates, have all come out in favour of joining NATO over the past few years. Polls indicate public support swinging modestly in this direction: 43% in favour and 37% against. But there are several hitches.

One decision for the next prime minister is whether to sign a UN treaty “banning” nuclear weapons. Some Social Democrats, including Margot Wallström, the foreign minister, are keen. But it would strain Sweden’s relationship with America and NATO. A more serious obstacle is that any Moderate effort to take Sweden into NATO might depend on the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats. The party is opposed to membership on nationalist grounds, though its base, numbering many former Moderate voters, might be more amenable. A third problem is that Sweden is reluctant to leave Finland in the lurch, if its smaller neighbour declines to join. Meanwhile, as the wrangling continues, Sweden hugs NATO ever-tighter: over 2,000 of its troops will join one of NATO’s largest-ever exercise next month"".",Vatican City,/r/europe/comments/9l85pu/russias_growing_threat_to_north_europe/e74rhxn/,marsianer,1538622700

No but that's my point. You are making it sound like Spain was some super close US ally that toed the US line after World War II. It wasn't. Spain was not a military ally of the US until the 1980's when it joined NATO. Spain became democratic in 1977 before it joined NATO.

2621,"I don't think this is about the ability to express the same meaning or context but about the complexity of doing so.


For instance, in Polish there is a so called dual case, as opposed to singular and plural, which used to exist in the English language too (in personal pronouns). So for instance the word ""two"" for ears, or eyes is different than for most other nouns in plural.


Also, Polish has more grammatical genders than is commonly accepted by a mere casual student. In addition to masculine, feminine and neutral the masculine gender has 3 types:

-   rodzaj męskoosobowy - masculine personal (any living male person)
-   rodzaj męski żywotny - masculine animate (for instance dog)
-   rodzaj męski - masculine inanimate (all no living objects of masculine gender)


So of course ""dwa psy""  can be easily expressed in English as ""two dogs"" but in Polish the numeral will be declinated differently depending on which type of masculine the object is.  


That is definitely more complex than English.


As a side note: this allows to express some concepts in an unusual way by assigning the feature of an object that is not its true nature, a kind of stylizing. 
For instance:

""Dwaj garnkowie"" sounds as if garnek (cooking pot) was a person. In English, from what I can tell, the only way to say this would be ""Mr. Pot"". It is the same meaning in a way, and yet the feel totally different. ",,/r/europe/comments/9kn5bn/the_beauties_of_the_polish_language/e74iu99/,sektabox,1538614336

As it is geared at present, the Union does not have any stake in any commercial or industrial endeavour.

This may be however an idea to consider in a near future, as the times demand enormous investments in fields like energy and transportation, long-term invesments that are unlikely to be realized by private operators.

Just no.

France has nearly all this Mediterranean food heritage (some stuff like pesto sounds 100% italian but is also traditional in the South of France and is called pistou, there are many other examples) + butter based food from the north (sauce based recipe, patisserie).

2764,"No, I do understand your point. 

For starters it isnt the same with Russia. Most russians get their news via tv. Sources that the Russian government doesnt control are not on Russia tv and not easy to get in Russia if they are in russian. Russia even lets some print they dont control to operate in Russia, because the Russians they need to brainwash wont read it so they do not care. 

CNN is pretty bad news. It isnt propaganda but it is more for entertainment than actual journalistic research but even if a Russia wanted to go there most couldnt because there is no good CNN Russia. Very few of the good journalistic outlets have Russian to reach the Russian people, the BBC is a very rare exception and that is why it is slandered constantly by the Russian government to steer russians away from viewing it. So Russians do not have access to most free news. We both agree on this. 

Furthermore, discussing what is said on say BBC Russia can get you in trouble in Russia. The climate is different. There are people that will beat you up if you being publicly outspoken against say Putin. It doesnt mean it will happen but it can easily happen, and they can easily get off with no consequences or a slap on the wrist. You can also lose your job, etc. Same with the internet, the Russian government absolutely monitors social media and popular communication in Russian. Speaking things they do not like in popular places can have consequences. 

But the worst part is even if this wasnt the case a lot of Russians are like Trump supporters they just dont care about the truth or want it if isnt approved by the russian government. This isnt solely a Russian thing, but this attitude is very prevalent there. If something is true and there is overwhelming evidence they will just dismiss it offhand, or come up with a very weak excuse on why they will refuse to believe it. Russian media generates a never ending list of such excuses they can use to do this and most Russians will do so. It isnt because they are stupid, it is because they want to show loyalty to the Kremlin. It is same with Trump supporters, they dont really believe all the BS Trump says but they will use his justifications however weak they are to ignore the truth because they want to support Trump. When they are using excuses they will just deflect, *what about America.* It is instinct to many Russians, and to Trump supporters *what about Clinton.* Basically it is an excuse to go on the offensive and repeat attacks on people they dont like like a religious chant instead of thinking about or discussing something they dont want to think about. Finally there is the *this is the way things are everywhere and always will be,* myth. They likely know it isnt true but it is an excuse not to care, *sure russia sucks and the government lies but its like this everywhere and there is nothing anyone can do.* 

And even after 911 the media was not controlled by the government. In Russia the government is controlling it. In the US they arent. People though incorrectly because they were upset and believed government lies, I discussed this briefly above, but it wasnt due to the government only allowing this propaganda to exists. Rather it is just because they lied and lied big, which works. It works really well when it targets the biases of people. 

So to say the US news  is anything like Russia is complete and utter bullshit.  Your point is wrong. All news is not corporate controlled and not all corporate controlled news is censored or has an agenda set. The major US news networks arent propaganda outfits but money making outfits and making money sets their agenda, which is based off what viewers want. This is the opposite process from Russia. And on these networks there are people with different views and some of them go against even the network and the network is often fine with it if they make money. Then there are news sources that arent controlled by corporations. The news media can have integrity and people take this very seriously and will expose even politicians and helping politicians and parties they like and parties they do not like for the sake of journalism. The US has real jounalism and independent news that isnt controlled or censored by the government. Russia does not have it, that is not to say there arent people in Russia that want this and have journalistic integrity, they are just harassed, arrested, or killed and the Russian people largely wont care. 

Now trump does want to contorl the news like Putin does, and is trying to foster hostility to media that doesnt bend to him like it does in Russia, but he isnt successful. The media destroys him everyday with true things he doesnt want getting out, if anything they are going through a golden age due to him. 

So enough with the whole *but but the corporations man*. I am a left wing guy myself and find some news outlets in the US problematic but it is nothing like Russia, and there is no proof of some set agenda like there is in Russia. In the US trying to set an agenda for news to follow would be in the news, and not in a good way, *Government tries to make news outlets follow agenda here are the details,* and it would be a scandal. In Russia it wouldnt be a scandal because it is the situation, everyone knows it, and most Russians are happy with it. 

Trump and Putin supporters arent that much different but Trump supporters are maybe 33% of the US, whereas Putin supporters are probably &gt;70% of Russians. 

I get your point but it is a false equivalency. The US news media, nor corporations, do not really shape opinion, like the Kremlin does in Russia. There are influencers in the US, but they are too varied and numerous in the US to ever control. In Russia the Kremlin can shape a false reality for the majority of Russians. Trump can do this for a minority of Americans, but in the US the sources of belief and news cant be controlled. At least not yet, perhaps Trump will become a dictator and use violence to do this, that is how Russia maintains its 1984 esque monopoloy on thought, or perhaps Google will build such a good AI or deep learning machine it will be able to do so. But at the present the situation isnt the same. Now what shapes opinion and culture in the US is interesting but that is a much deeper conversation.

2780,"It wasn't a step towards something resembling the 1967 armistice line or moving accordingly in steps of the 'peace process' when you:

1. Start intensifying building and expanding settlements in the West Bank the very week after. It's a deflection, the West Bank has much more valuable (historically and agriculturally) land and isn't as densely populated. 
2. Your only reason for disengaging from Gaza is because it's benefiting the illegal occupation and stagnating any form of peace. Does that sound weird? Well let's take a look at what the senior advisor of the israeli PM at that moment has *openly* said: 
&gt; In October 2004, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's senior adviser, Dov Weissglass, explained the meaning of Sharon's statement further:
&gt; 
&gt; The significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process, and when you freeze that process, you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, and you prevent a discussion on the refugees, the borders and Jerusalem. Effectively, this whole package called the Palestinian state, with all that it entails, has been removed indefinitely from our agenda. And all this with authority and permission. All with a presidential blessing and the ratification of both houses of Congress. That is exactly what happened. You know, the term `peace process' is a bundle of concepts and commitments. The peace process is the establishment of a Palestinian state with all the security risks that entails. The peace process is the evacuation of settlements, it's the return of refugees, it's the partition of Jerusalem. And all that has now been frozen.... what I effectively agreed to with the Americans was that part of the settlements would not be dealt with at all, and the rest will not be dealt with until the Palestinians turn into Finns. That is the significance of what we did.[22]






3. It's not 'leaving Gaza' when you keep control of their [air space, seas, borders](https://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/control_on_air_space_and_territorial_waters) *and* what comes in and goes out. Also it's not 'leaving gaza' when you make a 'demilitarized zone' that engulfs a region that resembles 20% of the entire gaza strip (which has been condemned as well and a act of violation of human rights, many times).

More on this:

&gt; Israel unilaterally and illegally established a so-called ‘buffer zone’, an area prohibited to Palestinians along the land and sea borders of the Gaza Strip. The precise area designated by Israel as a ‘buffer zone’ is not clear and this Israeli policy is typically enforced with live fire. The establishment of the ‘buffer zone’ is illegal under both Israeli and international law.Preventing Palestinians from accessing their lands and fishing areas violates numerous provisions of international human rights law, including the right to work, the right to an adequate standard of living, and the right to the highest attainable standard of health. Enforcing the ‘buffer zone’ through the use of live fire often results in, inter alia, the direct targeting of civilians and/or indiscriminate attacks, both of which constitute war crimes.",,/r/europe/comments/9kzzzx/the_countries_with_the_most_unesco_world_heritage/e74ce6q/,DogeAndGabbana,1538608137

2940,"well okay if you want to nail it down on death counts, let's do this. since this is a post/comment chain based on germany, let's look at how many deaths due to islamist extremism we've had lately. 

[this 2016 article](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/chronik-wieviele-deutsche-wurden-bisher-von-islamisten-getoetet/13977950.html) based on a report my our domestic security agency counts 124 deaths due to islamic terror since 1993. however, that includes and is largely made up of deaths in other countries including soldiers in afghanistan (which wow, death during a war, who would have thought), etc. for germans dying inside of germany due to islamic terror, we get a whopping 0 at that time. two US soldiers were shot by an islam extremist, and there were the würzburg train axe dude and the suicide mission in ansbach but those had no deaths besides the attacker. 

obviously in late 2016 we had the christmas market truck, which tragically killed 16 people and also the as well as the stabbing in hamburg which killed 1. the global terrorism index accounts for around 33 deaths in germany relating to terror from 2014 and 2017, which includes the 17 mentioned here as well as deaths with unsure motives like paul h. who did shout islamic phrases but turned out to be a confused german man and the bavarian shooting which still has unclear motives \[[source](https://orange.handelsblatt.com/artikel/36264)\]. but let's go with 33 just for the sake of it. 

due to the NSU terrorists we did a bit of a re-investigation into old unsolved case files, which now puts the number of deaths due to right wing extremism in germany since 1990 at 83. record keeping my independent agencies like the amadeu antonio foundation or the [tagesspiegel/zeit investigation](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/interaktive-karte-todesopfer-rechter-gewalt-in-deutschland-seit-der-wiedervereinigung/23117414.html) put the number at around 169 deaths up to 190. even by official numbers you had a whopping 25 deaths one year alone. this is also just in germany, so not germans dying outside of it like that very first number. 

now obviously this looks at different time spans, and the whole process is differently. islamic terror tends to happen in bigger events for the shock value of it all (one of the key goals, after all), hence higher death counts for single attacks.

right wing extremism so far happens more often but with lower death counts (the NSU puts up 10 deaths, including a police woman, in 9 years as well as 43 attempts, three seperate bombings and 15 other violent attacks, though). those 83 deaths happened in over 70 different, seperate incidents. 

that to me is personally a load more scary. one person can kill a lot of people, yes, just ask alexander lubitz. and obviously we need to do something against islamic terror, not just in europe but worldwide (especially considering most victims of islamic terror by a huge margin live outside of europe).

but islamic extremism isn't normalized. it's treated as horrible, as it should be. in turn right wing extremism, even with something like the whole NSU scandal, is treated as a non-issue and not something we should worry about, even when you have literal hitler salute swinging nazis, a growing number of attacks and threats and a growing number of radicalized right wing extremists. there have been 8 arrested as potential terrorists [just this week](https://www.merkur.de/politik/rechte-terrorzelle-in-chemnitz-enttarnt-vier-weitere-maenner-in-u-haft-zr-10288892.html). reports have the number of militant right wing extremists and salafists at around the same number, [with right wing nudging them out in most accounts](https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Verfassungsschutz-Zahl-der-gewaltbereiten-Extremisten-gestiegen-3763526.html). pretending as if right wing extremism isn't a problem is naive at best and ignorant at worst, if you ask me.

That growth was obtained due to companies anticipating their usual business with the outside before Trump's taxes came into place. This next trimestre will show that.

&gt;And what arguments do you have for that? America's been sustaining this growth for 200 years.

Cause their model of society is now showing its huge flaws. Poor wealth distribution, with a retrograde scholar programs, lack of social protection, making visible divisions between the rich and the poor. The US is not what Hollywood movies shows us. There's a lot of poverty hidden.

You know very well this isn't about lactose intolerance but about things like intelligence. The fact someone is better at something than someone, or some group is better at something than other group doesn't mean they're superior; superiority is a claim about inherent human value. Einstein is not a superior human being than me just because he had higher IQ. But anyone who points out a difference between groups is virtually always castigated as someone making superiority/inferiority claims even when they make repeated disclaimer that a person's or people's higher/lower score on something has no bearing on their human value and dignity.

I'm in a discussion with you, right here, right now. For all intents and purposes I'm ""they"" right now, I believe I used the words accurately and I believe I'm able to back them up in any context I'm using them.

You can't start with ""even if what you say is true the words are meaningless anyway"". You're barging into a discussion telling me that 'they' are the reason you don't care about an accurate definition.

How is that a basis for anything? Figure out if my usage of the terms is full of shit or not, work from there.

&gt;AFD is constantly called fascist and nazi. So everything is allowed against them, the whole ""punch a nazi"" idea. AFD is just one example of people/group that are incorrectly called that.

I didn't call the AfD a fascist party. You're in a discussion with *me*, not some vague group of people that can't get their vocabulary right.

What I am vocal about is that the AfD tolerates and embraces personnel that likes to share racist, anti-semitic and fascist ideas. The answer to that, in my opinion, is not to go ""the words don't mean anything, clearly that must be a ploy to denounce the party"".

The answer is to look at it with more nuance. I'm sure you and me both aren't fans of people who play down the Holocaust, want to glorify the 'achievements' of the Wehrmacht or call for boycotts because of someone's ethnicity. All of those things exist in the AfD - they don't exist in other major parties in Germany.

And that's what needs to be mentioned whenever the AfD is mentioned. 

A group of people that tolerates these views in their midst is dangerous, and if history has told us one thing it's that the actual neo-Nazis won't be convinced that they're in the wrong by neatly sorted arguments.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/9kqhez/girls_racist_poem_sparks_germany_row/e73c4mq/,rEvolutionTU,1538577925

But seriously: The only reason Austria isn't part of the same federal system as the other German states is 1) the rivalry between a handful of people in the 19th century (Hohenzollern and Habsburg) and then 2) the political post WWII strategy. In every other aspect, including culturally and historically, it makes no sense at all. The division is purely artificial. Sure, Austria has a distinctive cultural identity. That's undisputed, but it's the same with the German countries within the Federal Republic of Germany.

3199,"Because there's no need to include them in the scope and including all religions will piss off all the minority religious people who have at maximum 2 schools in the country for their faith. If anything this now reduces the need for these schools somewhat as the thousands of Catholic schools can no longer reject them. Let's be honest here and say that in the vast majority of these schools Catholicism will still be peddled by teachers (I know mine were all crazy religious) and the school calendar will still be based round Catholic events as will pretty much all religious teaching (for primary anyway). 

So in reality this doesn't actually stop these schools being Catholic, they pretty much all will be the same as they have been. Like that the 2 Muslim schools are based around Islam and I can't see why any Dubs would send their kids to a school that is based around the Islamic calendar &amp; teachings unless theyre wasn't another school anywhere near but they wouldn't have been built in the first place if that was the case. There is a need for the 90% plus Catholic schools to accept all faiths as outside of Dublin families of other faiths have no option to send them elsewhere. 

This becomes a problem when a parent insists on sending their non-Muslim kid to a Muslim school (or whatever religion) which I don't know why they would do that anyway except to make a point  or there isn't another school for like over an hour away (which would require schools being closed down). Or when traditionally Catholic start closing by the dozens and get replaced by other religious schools. Which wouldn't be easy as they'd need government approval anyway and I don't see there being a Muslim majority anytime soon. 

So if they included other religions they'd be including probably another couple dozen schools if even, who then could be forced to change a lot of the agreements they already have in place with the state. Really not worth the hassle to the state to include others when the likelihood of this causing real problems is slim to none and these problems wouldn't arise for decades and decades.",,/r/europe/comments/9l0kla/religion_as_school_admission_criteria_is_outlawed/e73ctpb/,ignore_my_name,1538578524

3266,"It's a lot more complicated than that. When the Eurofighter consortium got started, its members were Germany's Messerschmidt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB), Britain's British Aerospace, Italy's Aeritalia and Spain's CASA. France's Dassault refused to join.

MBB was merged, under Daimler-Benz' aegis, into what became Deutsche Aerospace (DASA), British Aerospace became BAE Systems, and Aeritalia went through a complex series of mergers to finally become part of Italy's state-owned industrial conglomerate Finmeccanica.

Eventually, DASA, France's state-owned Aérospatiale (which did *not* include Dassault) and Spain's CASA merged to form European Aeronatics, Defence and Space (EADS).

Airbus originally was a *consortium* of several European aerospace companies. After all this consolidation, only EADS and BAE Systems were essentially left (Finmeccanica, which has long been one of Boeing's biggest subcontractors, was never involved in Airbus). BAE Systems wanted to concentrate on its military business, so it finally sold its part of Airbus, including its production facilities, to EADS, which then renamed itself into ""Airbus Group"". The military and space divisions of EADS, which were not part of the original Airbus consortium, became ""Airbus Defence &amp; Space"".

Now, back in the 1960s, the French government essentially decided that Dassault would be exclusively in charge of making combat aircraft (it helped that Marcel and Serge Dassault were staunch Gaullists). State-owned Aérospatiale had to leave that field (even though it kept a missile division, which was ultimately spun off into MBDA). So, the French bits of Airbus Group have absolutely nothing to do with Eurofighter, and Airbus Defence &amp; Space are bitter competitors of Dassault, even if, to further complicate things, Airbus Group is one of Dassault's main shareholders.

Race classifications are by itself not hard rules but leave areas of interpretation, but genetic differences exist between human populations, absolutely no doubt about that. In fact there are probably more genetic differences between smaller groups of people than expected and there is evidence that cultural evolution also drives genetic evolution.

&amp;#x200B;

But cultural differentiation is a far greater deal which also explains variations of behavior over time which a racial theory cannot.

Racial differentiation in certain cultures are mostly actual cultural differentiation which can be seen how things like skin color and religion are used interchangeable with no apparent logical conflict to the person who uses theses terms.

We are predisposed to distinguish between us and them based on cultural markers, which can be skin colour or clothing , hairstyle ,accent, symbols , Religion, etc

I never mentioned your political views, this is about how you moderate. And I'm afraid the state of moderation on reddit is something I find lacking.

This is what I was talking about.

Instead of listeing to concerns about your moderation and moderation on this subreddit, instead of ask me how my consers can be addressed. You're just being an arrogant tool like you always do.

I can only assume that you think I'm some rabid trumpet blower, who just wants to criticise the evil mods!

I'm not, I was saying that your tone doesn't help you in the slightest.

I'm not saying you have to prosrate yourself and bend over backward for every tom, dick and harry that comes in and say ypu're doing wrong.

However I would expect that you have a tone which is open to engagement.

Every time it comes down to a situation where the rules are interpreted, it's a matter of opinion and the moderators have final say. And there isn't a right to appeal, you can message back, and be met with the same response and a ban for good measure.
That to me, isn't the open and transparent system I would want in something as important as the front page of the internet.

That guy might be talking our of his arse, I know that.

But he would've been more open to you and vice verse if your tone wasn't so dismissive and, I don't even know the word for it...

It was like you were done with him and whatever he had to say, and that was that.

I mean you have a subreddit of people that are just swept under the rug, as if they weren't there. And then you wonder why you have to deal with Trump trolls and brigading.

Fair enough you have a lot of morons to deal with.

But you get to define it.

And you get to define to politcal discourse that is used, and influences, thousands upon thousands of people.

And there is no process for any of this.

I voted Remain, and would've voted for Bernie Sanders. I'm not some right-wing, defender of internet liberty.

Don't act like I give a shit about your or your politics.

It's your tone I don't like. I can do anything a this is just my personal account. But this is your responsibility, and your job.

You can shoot down criticism without sounding like a cynical, jaded arse which can't be arsed with this shit anymore.

3380,"It’s mostly a matter of principle and identity now; Northern Ireland used to be the most prosperous and productive part of the island and was the only part really affected by the industrial revolution - ship-building, linen-weaving etc. They still build buses and aircraft there but no ships since the 70s (?) 

Part of why Ireland did so badly in its first 60 years of independence was that it was cut off from its only real industrial heartland and had to invent its own one.

NI never had to, they just kept their own ticking along until the Troubles. That, combined with 50 years of neglect has left NI with few industries as manufacturers headed east. The Republic invested in education and R&amp;D, took European funding to bring infrastructure up to modern standards (until the early 2000s, there was more motorway in NI than the entire Republic) and basically built ourselves up as an independent entity - or certainly as much as an EU member can be.

Northern Ireland has become entirely dependent on subvention from the British government. They have a massive, bloated public sector and things like a police force bigger than the Republic’s, despite having just over a third of our population, are expensive relics of NI’s heavily-militarised and policed recent past that won’t change anytime soon.

Like other posters have said, if you weren’t a unionist up til now, you’d put up with NI in the UK because its unique status gives it lots of advantages too - cheap to live there, lots of secure public sector jobs and, eh, Vauxhalls? You don’t see a border, you can live your life without much acknowledgement of being in a British territory so you don’t have to think about it much.

But if Brexit goes ahead - and you’d have to wonder these days - then anything could happen.   Northern Ireland will lose EU funding, British government funding will also drop as pennies are pinched everywhere and the border will, in some form, return. That reminder, the heaping of austerity upon austerity and the fact that the EU have guaranteed NI would be readmitted if it unified with Ireland are all in the mix when a soft unionist starts reassessing their situation.

Unity could happen here as sudden and unexpectedly as it did in Germany. The only difference is that the DDR didn’t have loyalists who fought to remain Communist. And it seems unlikely Northern Ireland’s loyalists would ever acquiesce quietly into a unitary state.

&gt; As a result, the public infrastructure of Germany is deteriorating. About 50% of Germany’s highway bridges were built between 1965 and 1975. They are in urgent need of replacement. In addition, 17.5% of all motorways need to be urgently reconstructed, as well as 34% of country roads. 

&gt; Only 2% of all German households have fast internet via fiber, compared to the 22.3% average in the OECD. In Spain, not as rich as Germany, more than 50% of households have access to fast internet. This not only hinders economic development, but gives German companies a clear-cut incentive for investing outside of Germany.

3499,"Bosnia was a Yugoslavia in a Yugoslavia. When Yugoslavia broke apart due to nationalists wanting to rule their own countries, the same thing happened in Bosnia. All 3 sides wanted to get independent from eachother, and Croatian and Serbian minorities had backing of both countries, military as well as financial, while Bosnians or Muslims ( not sure what the right English description is) had the backing of other Muslim countries, again military as well as financial. 
 
It's important to understand I'm not saying all three sides were equally destructive or brutal, but that the reasons for fighting was the same on Croatian and Serbian side. 
Izetbegovic called for a referendum and was immediately warned that any independence referendum was unconstitutional (as was the Slovenian one and Croatian) and that Serb populated areas would immediately be joined to the remaining Yugoslavia. In Slovenia case, same thing happened, but there was no significant Serb or Croatian population there.
Bosnian Serbs vacated the parliament, boycotted the referendum, and Alija though that if the referendum succeeded, the EU and US would send troops to back it up and prevent any problems. 
 
So the referendum took place, and everything promised, even though it was wrong from the Serbs to do anything about it, happened. They tried to annex Republica Srpska by force, in order to not let 1/3 of the country be somewhere where they didn't want to be, and from a constitutional perspective shouldn't even be in. Morally, that's a fucked thing to do, but legally, within the Yugoslav constitution, independence was not legal, so was not referendum about it. So if nothing else, Izetbegovic creates the perfect environment for fighting to start as unfortunately Bosnia wasn't like any other Yugoslav country. His miscalculation about EU and US support was a massive mistake. No one came, Serbs revolted, Croats saw this as a chance to annex their part, and the conditions for the war were unfortunately perfect.
 
So yes...Serbs were worst when it comes to war crimes and brutality, but please cut the bullshit Alija or Tudzman were not at fault or not to blame for the war. 
 
Same shit is happening in Spain, Catalonia wants independence, constitution says it's ilegal, Catalonia had a referendum, Spanish government sent the army and police. Imagine now, if Catalonia had backing of a state...we'd be having another war, as they're forcefully being kept in a country for 50 years against their will.

3605,"Who the fuck cares what Thomas Jefferson said in the 1790s? The US didn't actually anything in the 1790s. We were barely a country back then. You need actual historical things that the US did. I'm sure I can find you some quote from some Brazilian claim back then claiming how they would take over all of South America once they became independent. What they were mostly talking about then was taking over Spanish unpopulated land in North America (including Florida and Texas where few people lived at the time). In the 1790s they weren't talking about taking over Central or South America. That's far away from the US. They were talking about the Spanish lands right next to the US at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

The Spanish-American war is probably the earliest thing, but that was a war against Spain. Cuba was given its independence in the war because of US actions. Though we did annex Puerto Rico. But even that's not 200 years ago. Puerto Rico was actually happy to join with the US back then anyway. They like being US citizens. All the serious involvement in Latin America started in the 1930s. **I'm not disputing all the shit the US has done since then, just this ""for 200 years"" claim.**

&amp;#x200B;

We are British colonists in North America. Y'all are Spanish colonists in South America. We are both colonists here. Neither of us were victims 200 years ago. In the beginning you stole this land from the indians with the Spanish Empire just like we stole this land from the indians with the British Empire, when we immigrated here 400 years ago. But the US was not at all messing around with Latin America 200 years ago. We were sticking up for Latin American countries back then because 200 years ago we were both countries that had just gotten independence from Europe and had a lot in common back then

3609,"It is indeed not binary, but treating these issues as totally separate is also not always sensible. Europe is treating all the little problems as separate issues for political reasons, which is fine. This approach can achieve some headway even when no fix for the fundamental issues can be made. The current US is viewing them as a consequence of the same main problem for a reason. When the sanctions were lifted, Iran's hostile activities increased immediately because of all the money pouring in. The US political establishment never supported the deal and is now seeing increased hostilities from Iran as a consequence of it, so they will see it as binary. It's giving money to your enemies to help them attack you and your allies in exchange for a lousy deal they weren't willing to ratify in the first place.

&gt; No, Iran is not an angel but it is absolutely comparable to Saudi Arabia and we aren't advocating economic war against the Saudi's either.

No it isn't. Saudi Arabia is aligned with US strategic interests and frequently works with the US, but Iran is actively opposing the US. You're looking at this like it's some theoretical moral problem the US has with Iran, so therefore people doing similar type of things should be treated in similar fashion. It isn't that, it never is. Every nation does bad things and no one really cares outside public rhetoric. It's about how their strategic interests and activities align with. Iran hates the US, so their influence and power needs to be diminished at every opportunity until that changes. It is irrelevant what the reason for the hate is or how justified it is. Let the issue go and you can be post-WW2 Germany or Japan, hold on to it and you can be North Korea or Palestine. Rational nations let the issue drop when it concerns government policy, because it is much more beneficial to themselves to do it. Iran is still firmly on the ""death to America"" / ""wipe out Israel from the map"" -path.

&gt; Also, this bombing attempt is one of the sketchiest things possible. The day before the Iranian delegation comes to Europe in order to save the Iran deal they supposedly decide to try to massacre a bunch of people on French soil. This is a totally logical step from Iran to take right? Not really, so probable either hardliners within the IR who wish to sabotage the Nuclear deal or outside actors. Or Rouhani and Khamenei got drunk on vodka while planning their foreign policy.

Like how Syria has no reason to use chemical weapons, since they've already won their civil war, and using them would only invite foreign intervention? I don't dispute the logic you're using and I agree to it, but also be aware that your view of the situation can be narrow and myopic compared to a nation's and your brand of logic isn't universally shared. They basically follow their own line of logical reasoning, but your own perspective and values are so different, that it's hard to see the logic of that reasoning from your perspective.",,/r/europe/comments/9ku83g/reuters_france_points_finger_at_iran_over_bomb/e72o057/,DoubleSteve,1538542019

3628,"&gt;Iran may be an islamist shithole, but at least they keep it to themselves.

The king of Jordan spoke of a Shia crescent forming in 2004, that after removing Saddam Iran was using its political influence on the Arab side of the peninsula due to the weight of numbers of Shia on the peninsula. As well as sponsoring, training, arming militias in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, Bahrain and Eastern Saudi the Arab states felt that Iran's political manipulation and military manouvering presented an existential threat to the gulf states. The west agrees which is why they have been arming Saudi, it's why there have been so many wars, those wars were about turning the Shia croissant into the Sunni baguette to quote Karl Sharro.  There are many criticisms of the Shia crescent theory for example the Iraqis have their own shia identity with their own ayatollat, the Shia crescent is a blunt, one dimensional argument for explaining incredibly complex social structures and societal motivations reminiscent of the anti Semitic argument that Jews are more loyal to Israel than their native country. However that hardly matters because the west and NATO believe it and since the gulf states are part of their protectorate have been fighting the Shia militias using Sunni jihadi militias (it takes a network to break a network theory).  

The Shiites are much, much better fighters and without western support they would take the likes of Saudi, Jordan, Qatar, Bahrain easily obviously the west cares about that because that would place all that oil in the influence of Iran (and consequently Russia) who would now have unlimited funds to further destabilise the region and disrupt global trade, obviously that would destroy the regional hegemony that exists to protect western profits and make a total nuclear holocaust of Iran far more likely.

That being said, this doesn't mean no differences between ""population"" exist.

3726,"You do not understand that marriage does not work the way you think it does.  Let me explain:

To be married, you must possess a marriage license from the federal government.  Without this license, a relationship can not be said to be marriage.  This is the law.

Most or many people get married in a church.  They have a ceremony.  The church bestows its grace upon the couple after the ceremony.  In short, the church grants religious legitimacy for the marriage.

But here's the thing I think you missed understanding:

There is a point in the ceremony where the couple, having said their vows, *go sign some documents.*  Specifically, *they are signing the government-issued document that makes their marriage legal.*  Their marriage license.

Marriage *is not* granted by religious authorities.  It has *never* been granted by religious authorities.  It is purely a function of law.  **Marriage has no real meaning outside of the law.**

Civil partnerships are just a variation of marriage: it just another legal document issued by the government that grants rights, responsibilities, and consequences.  For that matter, there are other partnership agreements that enable more expansive co-ownership of property and different sets of partner roles and responsibilities.

Whether these agreements apply to pure or mixed human traits — sexes, races — is strictly a legal matter within a framework of well-established baseline human rights.

&gt;A law that can be directed against speech found offensive to some portion of the public can be turned against minority and dissenting views to the detriment of all. The First Amendment does not entrust that power to the government’s benevolence. Instead, our reliance must be on the substantial safeguards of free and open discussion in a democratic society. - US Supreme Court

Threats are not illegal, generally (unless immediate and credible). Blackmail is not considered speech (although that could be an interesting movie plot).

From that same Court decision, different Justice

&gt;Speech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express “the thought that we hate.”

3959,"&gt;Spitzenkandidaten is a representative regime, so it's strictly inferior to Switzerland's semi-direct democracy. I'd rather have EU take inspiration from Switzerland than the opposite.

Well, that happens: the Commission can be forced to take a position on an issue by means of petitions.

I don't think that referenda are the gold standard for democraticness, anyway. It prevents compromise, it's just tyranny of the majority. And even so it still places power in other hands that the population: namely the people who get to formulate the question can frame the issue to manipulate the outcome, and if contradictory referenda are voted adjucation still happens somewhere else what to give priority.

And after all, that all resulted in Switzerland being about the last in Europe to give women an equal representation. That's a disqualification from having the last word on democraticness.

&gt;Also, the very texts that empower the Commission also embed the rigid ideology I was talking about, so it's quite intertwined and hard to change. But that's a different topic.

Still, the lengthening of supply chains means inputs are transported back and forth round the globe, and I'm sceptical whether the linked article takes that into account.

The bottom line is that our whole civilisation is built on fossil fuels, and we'd rather die horribly than take the necessary steps to reduce dependency, increase efficiency and live within planetary boundaries.

*Addendum*: reports on emissions from battery production are even more damning:

&gt;IVL, the Swedish Environment Institute, has come up with a report which outlines the potential carbon impact of battery production. It shows that battery manufacturing gives rise to 150-200 kilograms of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour of produced battery. Tesla Model S for example, has a 100 kWh battery which means that when someone buys the car, they already are taking home a battery that has created an average of 17.5 tonnes of CO2 in its production process.

&gt;But then, the equivalent CO2 produced in the U.S. could be much higher than what is shown in the data gathered by the IVL. The calculations in the report are based out of the data gathered from Swedish battery production facilities, which accounts for electricity where half of it is produced by solar, wind, and hydropower - as Sweden is one of the leading proponents for renewable energy sources in the world. The U.S. banks a lot more on non-renewable energy sources with 78% of its total energy production coming from coal, oil, and gas. This could skyrocket carbon impact of a Tesla car in the U.S. before it even gets on the road.

In my opinion a fixation on pacifism would represent itself in support for much more strict statements like ""nobody should be a military person"" or ""soldiers are murderers"" (for which you can get in trouble in Germany); in my book pacifism requires the opposition to any war, military and arms industry, the idealistic idea that any war can be/could have been prevented with diplomacy.

4020,"Considering the Muslims ruled the Iberian Peninsula for 8 centuries, ""re-conquest"" is not the most accurate word for a strict historical analysis. Muslim Spain is another chapter of Spain's history. Many Spaniards today descend from them, and they contributed a lot to Spanish culture and even the language. But it still is the term everybody uses.

According to Wikipedia:

&gt; The modern idea of the earlier concept of Reconquista is inextricably linked to the foundational myths of Spanish nationalism in the 19th century, and consolidated by the mid-20th century during Franco's National-Catholic dictatorship, based on a strong underlying Castilian ideological element. The idea of a ""liberation war"" of reconquest against the Muslims, depicted as foreigners, suited well the anti-Republican rebels during the Spanish Civil War who agitated for the banner of a Spanish fatherland threatened by regional nationalisms and communism. Their rebellious pursuit was thus a crusade for the restoration of the Church's unity, where Franco stood for both Pelagius of Asturias and El Cid.

&gt; Some contemporary authors consider it proved that the process of Christian state-building in Iberia was indeed often defined by the reclamation of lands that had been lost to the Moors in generations past. In this way, state-building might be characterised—at least in ideological, if not practical, terms—as a process by which Iberian states were being 'rebuilt'. In turn, other recent historians dispute the whole concept of Reconquista as a concept created a posteriori in the service of later political goals. A few historians point out that Spain and Portugal did not previously exist as nations, and therefore the heirs of the Christian Visigothic Kingdom were not technically reconquering them, as the name suggests. One of the first Spanish intellectuals to question the idea of a ""reconquest"" that lasted for eight centuries was José Ortega y Gasset, writing in the first half of the 20th century. However, the term is still widely in use.

&gt; **Both Christian and Muslim rulers fought amongst themselves. Alliances between Muslims and Christians were not uncommon.** Blurring distinctions even further were the mercenaries from both sides who simply fought for whoever paid the most. The period is seen today to have had long episodes of relative religious tolerance.

If you're a party that campaigns on high welfare and wealth redistribution then low-skilled migrants are your best friend because they're virtually guaranteed voters. Since it's what I know best, look at UK voting patterns for migrants, even without looking at skill levels. Tony Blair era immigration in the 90s wasn't about economics or pension schemes or any of that. It was about:

1) ideological preference for cultural diversity - ""rub the right's nose in diversity"" as it was said

2) securing of future voters who fit your party's target demographic

**Automation will not change the perverse incentive structure for having lots of low skilled immigration.**

As for why the Tories continued on with similar levels after Blair - the business world and people with fixed assets likes flats in London do extremely well out of increased consumer demand. For regular British shmucks who just want to live their life we have been faced with pretty ugly twin heads. Brexit is basically the direct result of this imo. Tories want GDP increases to appease business interests and fixed asset owning aristocracy but are indifferent to the average Brit's per capita GDP.

**Belfer** (The Teach) from Canal+ is really good too, at least the first season.

**Ultraviolet** from AXN is good too, it grows on you (and is available on Netflix)

**Pakt** (The Pact) from HBO should be good too, first season is an adaptation of Norwegian ""Mammon"", second season is an original script.

And there is also coming out **Ślepnąc od Świateł** (Blinded by The Light) from HBO later this month and I'm sure it will be really good too.

From series that could be good, but I didn't watch there is **Kruk** (Raven) from Canal+ and coming out soon **Nielegalni** (The Illegals) from Canal+.

4183,"&gt; Yes you heard me right. Although I suspect you already knew that and were testing whether or not I knew what I was talking about. By the Maastricht treaty  you are not allowed to have a trade surplus of more than 6% of your GDP. Germany consistently exceeds that amount by 50%, hovering aroung 8% to 9%.

No I did not know that, and I honestly doubt it's true, can you provide me with the exact article that says a trade surplus cannot be above 6%?

&gt;You are not, maybe. Italy is still in an economic crisis, it's the third European country by unemployment rate. Our poverty rates have been growing for years, currently at 8.4% for individuals and 6.9% for families.

Neither are you. A growing economy is not an economic crisis. Italy has always had above average unemployment rates, but they are currently declining.

&gt;This is joke. Have you bothered taking a look at France's data?

I did and I actually addressed that by pointing out that those countries have significantly lower public debt rates, and by saying that they, too, should not be overspending that much.

&gt;Investments are necessary for kickstarting growth, as I said before, basically quoting what every economist would say since it's basic knoledge, expansionary measures are done in periods of stagnation/crisis/recession.

A 2% budget deficit is already a major investment, an investment made in a time of economic expansion. Italy is not in a period of stagnation/crisis/recession, that's why you should run a budget surplus or break-even budget because the next real crisis is on its way and when it happens public debt as a percentage of GDP will rise rapidly. It will be much harder to cut spending then than it is to not increase spending now.

4228,"&gt; It's not what the US military industrial complex, the political establishment and the deep state wants. 

You're acting like these are unified entities all backing the same goal, which is quite a childish view. 

You can't switch up your geopolitcal priorities in under a decade, you said this yourself:

&gt;if [...] the US military pulls out most of its forces, there will be a vacuum that needs to be filled, which will be filled by Arab Forces, Turkey, Iran and possibly Russia, all expanding their resources to their limit in long term, Turkey will probably do some land grab in Syria and maybe Iraq as well.

Such a power vacuum would only amplify security risks against the United States in the short term, which is good enough reasons for the US to keep a significant focus on the region for the time being while the ""pivot to Asia"" gets upscaled more and more in the future. 

You may not like it, but there is continuity on many aspects of the US foreign policy between the Bush-Obama-Trump administrations, the only significant changes are:

1. The Obama administration was willing to find a natural balance between Israel/KSA/Iran/Turkey through multilateral initiatives while Trump's seems more interested in just giving the keys to Israel/KSA and let them deal with it.

2. The Obama administration was trying to contain China's growing influence in the Asia/Pacific region through multilateral agreements by launching the TPP while Trump's stance is much more agressive by directly launching a trade war with China.

Outside of those two differences in approaches, US foreign policy's medium to long term objectives haven't changed a bit, there will still be a large focus on the middle east by the US when Trump leaves office, the downscaling of US operations in the region initiated at the end of W's administration will need to take a while to be done properly.",France,/r/europe/comments/9kptdf/germany_approves_295m_arms_sale_to_saudi/e71cwba/,tnarref,1538498975

4268,"Yes, I remember that referendum, it was really such a joke. The whole world was laughing at Greece. The government was just trying to strengthen its hand in negotiations and people would have voted for anything they asked.

Frankly, referenda just do not work in our age, people never vote on the issue that is put before them, they vote to support the government or to punish the government ... regardless of the question put before them. So, it makes no sense to have referenda, representative democracy is about choosing trusted representatives who can take the time to study the issue, engage experts and reach a decision that is better founded than the mass vote.

The problem is that issues have become exceedingly complex. You will remember when Tsipras asked Varoufakis what would happen when Greece exits the Euro, and his answer was ""it is unprecedented, no one really knows"". So, a man who many consider a major economist cannot calculate the effects on the economy and society, and we ask ordinairy people to make such decisions ... this is not democracy, this is populist bullshit that leads to destruction.

We saw this with Grexit and we saw it with Brexit. It is a crisis in democratic thought that is not unique to Greece.

I really think that resolving this name issue does no harm to Greece, but brings many benefits. Greece benefits from stability in the north. Greece benefits from Northern Macedonia inclusion in EU processes. Greece benefits from the economic development that this will cause.

The public in Poland is just as divided on political matters as UE in general. While I haven't checked recent polls it shoudn't be much of a strech to say that it's a bit 50/50 now. The worst thing is that no matter how bad our goverment is (and IMO it's truly is terrible) the opposition parties are so weak and stupid they could be non existant. That's why PiS still has the support of not only fanatics but also probably those undecided and a bit unaware people. Not to mention the biggest rival party PO had lost face and a lot of trust after scandals during their time.

The sitation with media isn't helpful either, as our national TV is just PiS propaganda, while the other one is heavily biased (although I have to admit they really try to be objective, often critcisng both sides). What Poland really needs is someone with a brain and experience in politics, who can unite the oppostion and offer a good alternative and point out PiS lies and hipocrisy. As much as relative is Donald Tusk's reputation in Poland, I truly believe  he would be the right man to fix it. Though if I were him, I probably woundn't want to come back to this mess...

4331," **Paris is emerging as the favoured financial trading hub for continental Europe, as some of the world’s biggest banks and asset managers prepare for life after Brexit by steering their EU operations away from London to the French capital.**

BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase are poised to join Bank of America and Citigroup in the vanguard, according to people familiar with their thinking.

Over the summer BofA accelerated its preparations for Brexit by announcing details of a new Paris trading floor with room for 1,000 staff. Wall Street rival JPMorgan Chase is also increasingly attracted by Paris, bankers said, though it has yet to declare officially how big a trading operation it will put in the city.

“Over time, and depending on if a place becomes the new financial centre in Europe, we may do what we did in London 20 years ago, and consolidate,” Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan investment bank chief, told the Financial Times.

Until recently, attention had focused on which eurozone financial centre would attract the new formal subsidiary registrations, as banks, insurers and asset managers have raced to ensure they have the legal and regulatory structures in place to continue doing business across the EU27 if and when they are barred from “passporting” out of London.

4337," Frankfurt and Dublin dominated that battle. But Paris seems set to triumph in trading — a more valuable prize due to the jobs and taxes that go with it — as banks and asset managers realise the merits of establishing a dominant hub to concentrate market liquidity and expertise for the trading of securities.

“If you ask most people in the industry, the number one choice is Paris,” said the boss of a large investment bank, adding that labour costs are now as low as the UK.

The Parisian expansion comes as the UK’s City minister said Britain would do “whatever it takes” to defend the position of London as a global financial centre. John Glen said the numbers that have been shifting out of London are so far limited, adding: “It is totally at odds with the flowery rhetoric you see from European leaders — you know, saying ‘Come to Paris’.”

Another big factor in banks choosing Paris has been the sophistication of French regulators, which have long overseen the complex trading and derivative operations of BNP Paribas and Société Générale, financiers said.

Banks’ plans are tracking those of their clients, with 70 asset managers — from large groups to small hedge funds — in the process of securing licences to operate in Paris, according to officials. BlackRock is chief among them, and is even considering designating Paris as its pan-European headquarters, according to two people close to the $6.3tn money manager. That could see its office there expand more than six-fold to between 200 and 300 staff within a year or so.

“This is contentious because London would continue to be the bigger office,” one of the people said. “But it makes perfect sense structurally.”

BlackRock had already said Paris, not London, would be its new base to provide “alternative” investment services across Europe and Asia, relating to hedge funds, real estate and commodities.

&gt;  Das Problem mit der Zivilcourage
&gt; 
&gt; Poetry‐Slam‐Beitrag von Ida‐Marie Müller
&gt; 
&gt; Der Neger ist kein Neger mehr / Zigeuner darf man auch nicht sagen.

&gt; Rassistisch ist das beides sehr / so hört man es an allen Tagen.

&gt; Wer´s trotzdem wagt wird ausgebuht / gefeuert und geächtet,

&gt; In Zeitungen und Talkshows mit viel Wut / denn so sind die „Gerechten”.

&gt; Das Kinderbuch prüft ein Zensor / Weiß ist jetzt Sarrotis Mohr.

&gt; Und das nennt sich dann Zivilcourage / Und wisst ihr was? – Das ist für‘n Arsch!

&gt; 

&gt; Aus fernen Ländern kam der Gast / Dank Menschenhändlerbanden.

&gt; Reist mit Handy, und ohne Pass / in den gelobten deutschen Landen.

&gt; Verbittert ist der junge Mann / Finanziell geht‘s ihm zwar besser.

&gt; Weil er aber kein Fräulein haben kann / hilft er schnell nach mit – einem Messer.

&gt; Ein Einzelfall, so sagen die Experten. / Kultursensibel sei das zu bewerten.

&gt; Wer wütend ist und‘s anders meint / Ist nur ein brauner Fremdenfeind.

&gt; Und das nennt sich dann Zivilcourage / Und wisst ihr was? – Das ist für‘n Arsch!

&gt; 

&gt; Das bunte Bündnis, tolerant, zivil und breit. / Wir finden‘s in jeder Stadt.

&gt; Gekämpft wird dort für Moral und Menschlichkeit. / Ein jeder dabei wer nen Namen hat:

&gt; Linke, Gewerkschaft, Kirchenvertreter / Karrieristen und Volksverräter.

&gt; Der Flüchtling und der Muselmann / die muss man integrieren.

&gt; Ob man das auch bezahlen kann / hat nicht zu interessieren.

&gt; Wenn Deutsche verarmen, ist doch egal. /So weiß es die linksgrüne Hypermoral.

&gt; Und das nennt sich dann Zivilcourage, / Und wisst ihr was? – das ist für‘n Arsch.

&gt; 

&gt; Für alle die zu uns einwandern / fordern die heil´ge Solidarität.

&gt; Die Opfer bringen dann die Andern / S´ ist bequemer so und tut nicht weh.

&gt; Mutig geben sie vor zu sein / woll´n aber nichts riskieren.

&gt; Sie glauben an ihre Heuchelein / denn geschickt sind sie im Lavieren.

&gt; Bunte Vielfalt statt braunem Brei / Hauptsach´ die Stadt ist Nazifrei.

&gt; Und das nennt sich dann Zivilcourage/ Und wisst ihr was? – Das ist für‘n Arsch!

&gt; 

&gt; Dort wohnt ein AfDler und Rassist / So wissen‘s Büttel und Denuzianten.

&gt; Und geben Namen und Adress / schnell weiter an die Antifanten.

&gt; Dem schlägt man dann die Fresse ein / In unsrer Stadt darf der nicht sein!

&gt; Hundedreck im Briefkastenschlitz / bei Nacht und Nebel, was für ein Witz.

&gt; Im Kampf gegen Rechts ist alles erlaubt / Hier geht es um Demokratie und Werte.

&gt; Deutschland verrecke, schreien sie laut / wie eine Hornochsen‐Herde.

&gt; Und das nennt sich dann Zivilcourage! / Und wisst ihr was?! – Das ist für‘n Arsch!

&gt; 

&gt; Und die Moral von der Geschicht?

&gt; Nun steck das Messer dir im Bauch / denn so ist‘s im Orient der Brauch.

4341," BlackRock has been courted hard by the French authorities, including through a meeting between French president Emmanuel Macron and its chief executive, Larry Fink. Mr Macron also helped persuade Citigroup to add as many as 100 staff to the 160 it already has in the country.

Christian Noyer, the former French central bank governor who is coordinating the Paris charm offensive, told the FT: “I think banks and asset managers will try to concentrate trading operations in one EU location. That doesn’t mean London won’t remain the biggest financial centre. [But] Paris could become the big trading hub in continental Europe.”

The election of Mr Macron, and the restoration of a business-friendly attitude evident in tax and labour policies, had been key, he said.

“This government is really problem solving,” he said. “I collect remarks in the financial industry. They tell me: ‘We have a problem there that we don’t know how to solve.’ I go to the government and they say: ‘Let’s find a solution’. It comes from Macron himself.

 Among other financial groups to redirect business to Paris, Morgan Stanley plans to add about 80 jobs in the city and Goldman Sachs has said France is a priority in its plans to double its workforce in continental Europe.

HSBC, which already has a big French operation, is moving as many as 1,000 jobs there from London. Paris Europlace, a lobby group, has forecast that 3,500 finance jobs will be created in the French capital because of Brexit.

4348,"So what?  Germany's ratio is over 60% violating the rule,also France's, Spain's, Portugal's, Greece's and most european countries violate the rule of &lt;60% debt/GDP.  
 Also unlike Italy France has been continuously having a deficit and not once the EU has issued a fine to them.  
 [Spain](https://tradingeconomics.com/spain/government-budget) has been having a huge deficit all these years consistently well over the 3% threshold.  
  
Take a look at [France](https://tradingeconomics.com/france/government-budget) also violating the rules all these years except in 2017. This year France is expected ~~again to exceed the 3%~~ to have a deficit within the limits, at -2.3%.  
  
Italy unlike those other countries only exceeded the 3% threshold for 3 years. That's it. While the other years was well within the limits.

It's a well known fact in macroeconomics that in times of crisis, or worse yet, recession, the states should adopt a expansionary monetary  policy, and a expansionary fiscal  policy.

4394,"&gt;     The problem with civil courage
&gt; 
&gt;     Poetry-Slam contribution by Ida-Marie Müller
&gt; 
&gt;     The Negro is no longer a Negro / you can't say Gypsy either.
&gt; 
&gt;     Racist is that both very / so one hears it on all days.
&gt; 
&gt;     Wer´s nevertheless dares is booed / fired and ostracized,
&gt; 
&gt;     In newspapers and talk shows with a lot of anger / because so are the ""righteous"".
&gt; 
&gt;     The children's book tests a censor / White is now Sarrotis Mohr.
&gt; 
&gt;     And that is called civil courage / And you know what? - That's for an ass!
&gt; 
&gt;     The guest came from faraway countries / thanks to human trafficking gangs.
&gt; 
&gt;     Travels with mobile phone, and without passport / in the promised German countries.
&gt; 
&gt;     The young man is embittered / financially he is better.
&gt; 
&gt;     But because he can't have a Fräulein / he helps out quickly - with a knife.
&gt; 
&gt;     An individual case, so the experts say. That should be evaluated in a culturally sensitive way.
&gt; 
&gt;     Who is angry and means it differently / Is only a brown xenophobe.
&gt; 
&gt;     And that is called civil courage / And you know what? - That's for an ass!
&gt; 
&gt;     The colourful alliance, tolerant, civil and broad. / We find it in every city.
&gt; 
&gt;     There they fight for morality and humanity / Everyone who has a name:
&gt; 
&gt;     Leftists, trade unions, church representatives / careerists and traitors to the people.
&gt; 
&gt;     The refugee and the Muselmann / they must be integrated.
&gt; 
&gt;     Whether one can also pay that / does not have to interest.
&gt; 
&gt;     If Germans become impoverished, it doesn't matter / So the left-green hypermoral knows.
&gt; 
&gt;     And that is called civil courage, / And you know what? - that's for an ass.
&gt; 
&gt;     For all who immigrate to us / demand the heil´ge solidarity.
&gt; 
&gt;     The victims bring then the others / S´ is more comfortable so and does not hurt.
&gt; 
&gt;     Courageously they pretend to be / woll´n but don't risk anything.
&gt; 
&gt;     They believe in their hypocrites / because they are adept at washing.
&gt; 
&gt;     Colorful variety instead of brown porridge / Hauptsach´ the city is Nazi-free.
&gt; 
&gt;     And that is called civil courage/ And you know what? - This is for an ass!
&gt; 
&gt;     There lives an AfDler and racist / That's how Büttel and Denuzianten know.
&gt; 
&gt;     And give names and addresses / quickly to the antifantes.
&gt; 
&gt;     Then you beat his face in / He must not be in our city!
&gt; 
&gt;     Dog dirt in the mailbox slot / at night and fog, what a joke.
&gt; 
&gt;     In the fight against the right everything is allowed / This is about democracy and values.
&gt; 
&gt;     Germany die, they scream loudly / like a herd of Hornochsen.
&gt; 
&gt;     And that is called civil courage! / And you know what?! - That's for an ass!
&gt; 
&gt;     And the moral of the story?
&gt; 
&gt;     Now stick the knife in your stomach / because that's the custom in the Orient.
&gt; 
&gt;     Everyone shouts with applause: / "" NA-ZIS RAUS !!!""

4404,"You are confusing EU Council and EU Commission the Commission is independent of the Council. It's the executive body of EU with power to make and exercise threats in some cases directly. In this case the Commission is against Italy increasing their deficit as the EP Finance sub-committee found that Italy has an miss-managed economy and industry not a underperforming one. But while the Commission is against it and is recommending lower deficit there is not much it can do because with @ 2.4 Italy is still adhering to EU rules.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is current government of Italy is causing a lot of uncertainty and the markets are reacting to this. While people might like populists economy and industry do not. This is made worse by statements of government officials that Italy would be better of outside eurozone and that it's the EU fault that Italy is in current situation due to EU stoking fears about it's deficit, budged and debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Italy leaving Eurozone and switching back to a domestic currency would not solve the countries problems. They would enlarge the problem long term in turn for a short term easing. The country has very poorly utilised southern parts, it's auto industry is prime example of miss management which fell bellow expected growth again in 16/17 period with only 5.2% growth while a smaller consortium PSA grew by 28.1%, even smaller RENAULT Group by 6.7%, VW Group 2.1% (considering the diselgate and size of the group is very impressive), Toyota Group grew by 12.4%.

Their auto industry is being propped up by Fiat while Jeep, AR are struggling and let's not forget Lancia/Chrysler still being stuck in gutter. This in the golden period of automotive industry. Dacia was brought from dead and Dacia alone is outperforming almost entire FCA Group. Kia, Hyundai brought from dead and both outperforming.

The prime example of how miss-managed the industry is, is Alfa Romeo. Another good example is Zavoli they were the lead manufacturer of LPG systems got complacent and lost massive portion of market share being late to DI, LDI and losing to Stag and Prins. And the story goes on and on.

Not quite, i accuse you of hypocrisy cause you're seeing Greece's annexation attempt as something bad, but when it comes to Turkey's unwarranted occupation of the island for 44 years you see no problems with it cause apparently Turkey believed that the Cypriot state was illegitimate.

4629,"&gt; Are you saying Assad should have surrendered to the Islamist rebels consisting of terror organisations and groups calling for sharia? Or should he perhaps have surrendered to ISIS?

No, I never said that

&gt; Assad is by no means an optimal leader, but he's certainly better than the current alternatives. Trying to make it out that the alternatives were better is naive at best.

I agree with this, I am generally always for a government instead of power vacuum which leads to anarchy

&gt; And you will have to post a source for your claim that most of the 5 million that fled were anti-Assad. What you're essentially saying is that Europe got flooded with ISIS-sympathisers and Islamists.

Being anti-Assad doesnt mean you're pro ISIS or Islamist, Western governments are anti-Assad too... Again I'll repeat, the conflict in Syria is largely fought between ethnic lines. Communities that support Assad (Allawites, Shiias, Christians) are the miniority in the country. Because he has somewhat of a government, he was able to control areas that supported him. The rest of the country is Sunni and largely against Assad. They are the majority of the population and majority of the refugees. For these anti-Assad refugees it will be a lot harder to return in an Assad controlled country.

&gt; As for your claim that nothing the Syrian government says can be trusted, that's just a foolish way of sticking your fingers into your ear to avoid having to learn the truth about the state of the regime.

What? Assad and his father have been very predictable for decades that they do anything to remain in power, even bombing thousands of their own population. This is not new or a controversial opinion at all.

All the points Im making 

- majority of Syria is anti Assad

- majority of refugees come from Anti-Assad communities

- Assad regime for 2 generations have proven to be completely brutal against all opposition

Are not new or controversial either.

4679,"The problem is that it is not true that it's not the mainstream left or far left. It is a ""left"" problem. The right is always forced to disavow the fringe elements; it's always distancing itself from the extremes. I, to this day, have not seen prominent members of the left disavow the extreme identity politics, the double standards and whatnot of their fringe in any meaningful ways. If they do, they are immediately labelled alt-right and ostracised. I'm talking about feminists not smacking down Jessica Valenti and her ilk, and so on and so forth. They are quietly acquiescing. There is no line in the sand, like in the case of the right, which you cross, then you are out of the club. The right has been forced to have a line like this (again, dog whistles notwisthanding; we are generalising).   

And this is troubling. It suggests quiet acceptance, and an incredible amount of hyporisy, not to mention it kind of paints the whole left in the colors of the extremists; after all, if you can't hear protestations from prominent thinkers, you are forgiven to think they agree. The ""oh, but it's only a fringe"" is not working.

Slavic languages use flexia, changing of the word itself (the word's ending is replaced with another one to transmit meaning). That's the case system. Also suffixes (inserted between a stem and an ending) and prefixes (added before the word) are used to give additional flavors. For example, in this word, ""dwojka"", -a is an ending that can be replaced to show relation of the word to other words in the sentence. ""dwo"" is a stem that codes the main meaning of the word - ""two"". -k- is a suffix that is used with numbers to make them nouns (not important if dvojka is a group of two or a tram that can be referred to by its number). -j- I'm not sure what exactly it means in Polish grammatically, most probably it's -jk- as the form of -k- to ""glue"" parts of the word together for easier pronunciation.

That's why you follow the outcome of the referendum if they vote for independence! There's not going to be much trouble if you do.

Men will passively get support from other men, i.e. if nothing else, they won't be questioned in roles due to their gender.  
The women who float to the top do so without comparable support throughout their life, and very likely some hardship directly related to their gender.  
Unless the institution benefits from having carbon copies of the same person, there's generally not a massive enough gap between, say, the #4-ranked candidate and the #10-ranked candidate to not have external issues to be worthy of consideration [for instance, at that range it is definitely conceivable to discount a candidate due to personality fit, among other soft-skill things.]

If you want the best of a society that's 50/50 and you accept the idea that men and women are not intellectually disparate by gender, then one can argue that choosing a small pool out of the total candidates could attain positive results from choosing the best of the men and the best of the women.

4915,"Is it really so hard to believe that the British had some role to play when an island with no real history of communal violence turned into such a place like so many other British possessions over just decades of possession? The British Empire had an interest in not wanting to lose Cyprus as a strategic base, which would obviously have been frustrated if the majority of Greek Cypriots had been able to successfully push for enosis with Greece. It's not surprising that it would then take steps to remedy this problem like it did literally anywhere else within its power and set local ethnic groups against each other so that they could focus their ire against each other rather than their rulers. In typical moves, Greek schools have limitations forced on them and the colonial police were disproportionately hired from the Turkish community.

Big surprise, the Greek groups who are more violently attempting to gain independence take on an increasing anti-Turkish bent while the Turks are getting concerned about all this and lean closer to either continuation in the empire or separatism, either of which is fine for the British. Looking at the situation today, the division of the island in two with the British as a 'neutral party' on their bases is startlingly similar to the British Prime Minister Macmillan's proposal in 1958. That way the UK can have leverage between both sides, never commit to either one fully and benefit all the while.

It's like how Russia will never actually solve the Nagorno-Karabagh dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan because it derives substantial influence and money by acting as a mediator between the two even while the predecessors of the Russian government are the one that actually caused it.

I know it's very annoying to read when people see your country lurking in every shadow conveniently causing all of their problems (I myself find it incredibly tedious to read such things about the more major one of my two countries even in the cases where it kinda holds water) but it's not really fair to make such a comment to a person who has to actually deal with having a split country over the matter.

If I were to make it to people without knowing what they like I would cut down on the spice and probably skip the jalapeños, or at least remove the seeds. But I posted my recipe as I make it for me and my girlfriend who either likes it just as much as I do, or at least pretends to.

You can get most of the ingredients in a normal grocery store here. Pickled jalapeños are everywhere, but fresh ones aren't as common. Chipotle in adobo sauce is probably the hardest to come by. I only know two stores in my town (Bergen) that have them.

Traditional Norwegian food can get a bit dull, especially the ordinary everyday stuff. But luckily we can make dishes from all over the world.

The referendum has no clear result. The question was ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"". What does that mean? Does that mean crashing to WTO rules is fine? Does that mean a deal like Norway? Does that mean leaving absolutely no matter the conditions? Who knows? You didn't have a referendum about that.

&gt; If we radically shifted direction every time there was a slight change of public opinion then we'll just end up turning politics into ping pong

Leaving the EU based on such a slim majority is already pingpong because a) the vote could go either way based on the weather and b) due to demographic change, you'll have a majority for remain in 5 years or less...

Don't get me wrong, my preferred option would be the UK leaving, they've been a gigantic roadblock in the EU. But personally I would prefer a Norway type deal. The WTO shit won't do anyone any good.

Those are good nice sounding reasons. Problem is that everything is relative, and you basically can't possibly be independent as a country in this modern age. All countries exist in a global context, and voting out of EU doesn't change that, and it doesn't change that UK is part of Europe and the world, and participating brings progress while staying out stifles it.


As an individual there is no doubt your independence is decreased as you lose EU citizenship and the rights that come with it. Voting for Brexit you have actively taken a degree of independence and freedom away from your fellows.


Regarding democracy there are things that transcend borders, and EU is a democratic institution that helps deal with that, voting for Brexit you are actually opting out of a democratic institution, making the context UK exist in less democratic not more.


What you are doing is wishful thinking, where you think you can simply ignore scale, It's a desire to Keep it simple that isn't realistic anymore, and the attempt to keep it simple (like the good old days), actually makes it a lot more complex and disconnected, ignoring scale makes it impossible to address matters of scale properly. IF EU didn't exist, the same level of cooperation would require negotiating with 28 countries individually instead, on everything from nuclear threat, to pollution crossing borders, to countries dumping markets with national subsidies and on and on.


EU is a framework for solving such issues, and it works so well we hardly notice, apart from when sensationalist press make a huge story out of silly issues like how we now can't sell curved cucumbers, because the industry itself wanted standards.


And the bureaucracy required to deal with EU is much much less and achieves more, than the bureaucracy required to deal with all countries individually.

5047,"Well, in the case of Scotland, they were in favour of remaining by around 60%. But there is still some lesser known protected products in the rest of the UK.

People in the UK voted to leave the EU almost exclusively for non-economical reasons: 

- Sovereignty: There is a dislike of decisions being taken in the EU instead of purely in the UK. This also applies to EU courts which gained notoriety following the long legal battle to extradite a extremist preacher and advisor of Al-Qaeda to Jordan

- Immigration: The EU places some restrictions on how borders and immigration within the EU can be controlled by the states themselves. The UK government has also neglected the wishes of UK citizens and migration to the UK has largely been limitless. UK citizens also don't tend to travel to the EU so restrictions on EU immigration largely doesn't affect them. It has also been argued that due to the increase of labour supply, wages in low-skilled jobs have been suppressed due to the amount of competition. The vote also took place during the recent and ongoing migrant crisis which boosted support for wanting increased restrictions.

- Integration: The UK is the least integrated in the UK of all EU states. It has it's own currency, it's not in the Schengen Area, it trades more globally. British people don't tend to consider themselves as European much compared to others.

- Climate: The UK is still recovering from the 2007-8 financial crisis. People are largely sick of the current way of life and a vote out of the EU is simply a vote for change. As of now, the UK still hasn't had much in terms of real wage growth since whereas most other EU countries outside of Greece/Italy/Portugal have.

- Misleading: There was dishonest use of statistics to suggest that the UK would be more economically viable outside of the EU. There was also significant support from large media sources for the UK to leave which published and helped participate in outreach of these notions.

- Campaigns: The Leave campaigns were active and promised a brighter future - the Remain campaign promised the same and were more focused on denying the Leave campaign than showing the positives of the EU.",England,/r/europe/comments/9kha4b/brexit_comic_in_dutch_newspaper/e703w3s/,Frogloggers,1538442275

5092,"&gt; Because Canada isn't a EU member

Britain is about to not be an EU member

&gt; because it was an agreement with an outside country

Britain is about to be an outside country

&gt; because both sides benefit from it

Both the EU and Britain would benefit from a trade deal similar to CETA

&gt; The EU does not benefit from a deal that rewards Britain for leaving

The EU wouldn't be rewarding Britain for leaving, it would be signing a trade deal with a foreign state.

&gt; the EU can not bend its own rules in favor of a county that decided to renounce it

The EU wouldn't be bending its own rules, the EU already has trade deals with other foreign states

&gt; That's like leaving your job and still demanding to get paid. You have every right to do that, but what incentive would an employer have to still pay you?

No, it's like leaving your job, for our employer to then realize they still need your labor, so you negotiate a better employment agreement as an outside contractor than as an in-house employee, granting your more freedom and less obligations. If you can negotiate that with your soon-to-be former employer, then it is not unethical to do so. You don't owe your employer anything.

&gt; All of this is without ignoring the troubled history of Britain in the EU. Countless exceptions and special rules were granted over the decades. It's obvious that the EU as a whole is very much tired of that.

So then it would be better for Britain to not be part of the EU, and instead be treated as a foreign state.

Long story short: if it is mutually beneficial due to Ricardian comparative advantage for the EU to sign a trade deal with Britain, then they should. The game theory of EU membership shouldn't come into it unless you fear the EU's current membership is not a stable equilibrium. And if you fear that, then the EU has much bigger problems than a trade negotiation with Britain.",,/r/europe/comments/9kha4b/brexit_comic_in_dutch_newspaper/e705fqb/,bob237189,1538443776

Unfortunately I agree that we’d probably still leave either way.

All democratic societies function on the ideals of the enlightment because those are the ideals that make democracy work.

It’s an action which is meant to negatively effect Russias foe, it’s not defensive. Russia is using its military to force to assert itself in the region. 

The way i see the aggressive/aggression thing is:
The attribute of being aggressive can be applied to russias actions. “These actions are aggressive” but aggression can be used to generalise the actions. For example: “Russian aggression in the arctic concerns Nato”

5209,"That's great politically but likely not enough economically.

Tourism is cyclical both annually and according to economic cycles too. When the next crisis hits less people will be able to afford travelling and it will hit Bulgaria quite hard.

Startups are generally not in a good spot in Europe, for cultural and financial reasons. We don't have enough risk-taking angel investors (and venture capital) and by the time they are willing to invest, the company may also get bank loans or go public. (Here in Hungary we have the children of Hungarian emigrants living in the USA because they were the most willing to invest.) Both banks and stock exchanges are strictly regulated and banks are rather risk-averse as well. Our stock markets are also limited in size and liquidity - the EU has stock exchanges in each country and average people generally don't hold stocks (compare to the 300+ million USA population where everyday people invest in stocks too).

Another problem is we don't really have an entrepreneurial culture. I don't know specifically about Bulgaria but in Hungary the conventional (post-communist) wisdom is to get a stable job and save money for your family - which worked in the stable socialist system, not now. We don't have a lot of people with the right mindset, even they don't know how to realize their ideas, it's difficult to find mentors, entrepreneurs have bad reputation (and they are often fraudulent and corrupt too) and the entire bureaucratical system makes it difficult to start a business and keep it alive without having friends in high places. It's possible to do it but it's easier to just make a fake company that helps redistributing tax and EU funds and in exchange you can keep some of the money.

Now I sound awfully negative and I wish I'd have a great idea but Hungary has similar problems and we can't solve them either. Maybe somebody with an outside perspective can give some good input.

Either way I hope we can stabilize and move away from Russia before the next crisis, at least politically.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/9kebxc/unemployment_rate_in_member_states_of_the/e6zn6eq/,AllinWaker,1538426637

EU membership gives us an advantage in dealing with third parties by basically acting as a force multiplier. The EU can have even the US over a barrel, because it's such an important export market for them. But us, alone? Not so much.

America and China are licking their lips and lubing up at the thought of having us alone and without the EU's might behind us in trade negotiations (did Trump stutter when he said ""America first""?). America, for one tiny and economically insignificant example, wants to export their shitty, diseased, cruel and *subsidised* poultry to us, and for us to end subsidies to our own farmers. Gee, I wonder who benefits from that? That's the kind of attitude they have towards us, and they know full well that we'll need them more than they need us post-Brexit.

India knows it's going to overtake us as an economy very soon, so has no reason to make a deal with us until it has the upper hand, and will shaft us the moment it can. Even putting aside the domestic political boon to be had in having the former colonial masters over a barrel, it's simply looking after their long-term economic interests.

The remaining EU27 will see us as a competitor and so will give us less favourable terms than we currently have and seek to steer trade away from us and towards them. And every step of that ruinous path means companies leaving, job losses, reduced tax revenue, cuts to public services.

When you are only capable of having two categories, and can't don't know let alone safely understand the interplay of expertise, experimental confirmation, reproducability and peer review.

The world doesn't work on ideal platonic categories in general, let alone when you basically have 2 barely functioning ones to work with. It's a machine, everything is a machine. You can't remove pieces and hope it works, and there's no inherent value in ""purity"".

Also, crush them a little using either a spoon and bowl or a mortar and pestle. They release a lot more flavour that way.

* More onions. Just four? No. Either use the four largest onions you have, or change it to 5 or 6 onions. 

* I don't like vinegar. You can omit it.

In early 2017, Maas proposed the ""Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz"" (""network enforcement law"") to combat online hate speech and fake news.[29][30][31] The United Nations responded with a letter, warning that several democratic freedoms were under attack.[32] The proposed law was met with criticism throughout Germany from industry associations, IT experts, scientists, net-politicians, lawyers, privacy activists and civil rights campaigners who regard it as unconstitutional and defiant of EU-law and warn of ""catastrophic effects for freedom of expression"", causing online platforms to drastically censor online speech, resulting in privatization of legal enforcement and abolishing online anonymity.[33][34][35][36][37][38]

&gt; The law was passed on 30 June 2017. It also requires social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, to publish a biannual report on received complaints and how they dealt with them.[39][40] Fines of up to €50 million are possible for companies that ""systematically refuse to act or do not set up a proper complaint management system"" and some warn that this threat of punishment may motivate companies to delete content rather than risk punishment.[39] In 2018, it was reported that the law had led to the deletion of one of Maas's own tweets in which he said an opponent was an ""idiot"".[41]

oh my, British exceptionalism at its finest. Too bad that it doesn't correspond to reality. London has been ONE of the most important cities in the world for hundreds of years, not THE.

Paris has been the cultural capital of Europe and thus of half the world for hundreds of years and French the language of the elite for much longer than English.

Arguably New York is much more important than London since WWII, probably before as well (1929 and all).

Before New York, Paris was much more important than London for anything regarding culture, although London was on par or maybe richer than Paris.

Big talk, no action.

This has hurt them badly in the federal elections and for whatever reason they decided to not change anything but continue doing so and even accelerating the pace. 

The predictable result of this is that it hurts them on both sides: the more liberal voters are sick of their right-wing rethoric and vote Green/FW/FDP while the more right-wing of their voters are sick of their inaction/inability to move Merkel and vote AfD.

Brexit, in contrast, is a sharp disruption. As the required work per container increases you have an immediate spike in total work demand by some twenty times.

5628,"Ah yes, fisheries. The broadest fact-free topic of European political discourse. Economically and socially too small for any politician or administrator to bother truly understanding, but emotionally big enough to justify grandiose statements and policies. 


I don't know the Dogger Bank Area or Pulse Fishing well enough to take sides here, but I do know this: It is entirely possible to use EU mechanisms to protect areas that straddle different EEZs, as is the case. If those mechanisms were used and the Dutch ship acted illegally, just nab him and arrest the captain/owner. Easy call and makes no difference whether he was using pulse, trawling, or gillnets. If those mechanisms were not used, then maybe we should wonder why. Was it because of political incapacity, or was it because the area can be fished without much harm, as long as it is properly regulated? 


Also, for what it is worth, the EU typically doesn't ""hand out"" licenses. It sets values for Total Allowable Catches for a year (and then splits it in quotas), it sets minimum sizes for catches/landings, and it sets the characteristics that fishing gears must all share. Then it falls to the member-states to decide if they'll catch their quotas with 1 boat using gear X or 10.000 boats using gear Y. Now, maybe Pulse being in a special testing phase implies some special case where the EU specifies a maximum number of licences, I really don't know, but that's not the standard behavior.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9ker8o/dutch_devastate_marine_life_with_electric_shock/e6yqh1w/,VicenteOlisipo,1538397925
5629,"Eh, not really. American football has much higher velocity impacts (thus the body armour) and the players are quite a lot heavier on average.

&gt;Rugby players wear far fewer pads, but it’s those pads that enable and embolden someone to hit another player with greater speed and force—and it’s the sudden stopping, not the impact itself, that causes the brain to crash into the inside of the skull, causing a concussion. Rugby players don’t wear helmets, but rather scrum caps, which do little more than prevent cauliflower ear—though again, it’s the helmet that allows for harder hits and a harder projectile, so helmets can be more dangerous for players than caps.

&gt;Rugby doesn’t have a system of downs like football, so it’s not as important to contest every single yard. In rugby, it’s more important that the man simply gets tackled—it’s ok if he drags you a yard or two as long as he doesn’t score. In football, that extra yard might mean a new set of downs so you get defensive players impacting the players hard and high—trying to stop the runner's forward movement immediately.

&gt;Another major contributing factor is that in football, offensive players are often looking backwards over their shoulder for the ball while the defensive player is in front of them. There is no way for the offensive player to see the hit coming and prepare himself for the contact. In rugby, the ball must always be passed backwards, and the defense is in front of the ball and much closer. The offensive player is able to see the ball coming and simultaneously the tackler, allowing the player to prepare for contact.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/9k9xsx/polish_volleyball_team_just_won_world_championship/e6yqhas/,Fornad,1538397934

Other German cities suffered far worse destruction and many more casualties, yet Dresden is the one that always comes up, because the Nazi's own propaganda singled it out as some special ""terror bombing"" (as opposed to the noble ""coventrification"" they called it when doing it themselves).

5700,"**Bean &amp; Vegetable Soup**

* 2 Cans of Mixed Beans drained &amp; rinsed (avoid ones with Butter beans, they take too long)

* One Onion, One Carrot, One Stick of Celery - all peeled and diced

* Half a Red Pepper, and Half a Yellow Pepper (don't use green)

* 1500ml of Chicken or Vegetable Stock

* 600 to 700ml of Passata

* 100g of cut macaroni

Optional: One clove of Garlic, and one Red Chilli.

I aim to have all the vegetable pieces just small enough to fit on a teaspoon (makes the soup easier to eat than bigger bits).

1. Saute all the vegetables in olive oil for ~2 minutes in a biggish pot that you have a lid for.

2. Put the lid on and sweat for ~10 minutes over a medium heat.

3. Then add the stock, and bring to boil, then down to a simmer for at least 10 minutes (up to an hour if you have time) I usually stop at 30 minutes.

4. Then add the drained beans, bring back to the boil, then add the Passata - bring to the boil again.

5. Add the pasta - you'll need to time this for half the time it says on the pack (the pasta's staying in the liquid, so it'll keep cooking). In my case, it's 4 minutes. Then remove from the heat, and leave for 30 minutes.

Bon Appétit :)

Optional:

While the soup is cooking in the pot, slice or crush the garlic and deseed &amp; slice the chilli.
Saute over a very low heat in a frying pan with butter, add to the soup after the soup is made and let cool for 5 minutes.

Once the soup has completely cooled, it will keep in the fridge for 4 days and it serves ~8.

I've never really made this the same way twice, but the above is the gist of it.

Basil pesto makes a nice addition at the end sometimes too, but I'd keep it to under a teaspoon or it will simply be pesto soup.

Internauts from all over Poland report a strange old woman who is seen in the forests of Poland. The woman pushes a pram in which there is a doll without eyes. One of the recent events took place in the forests of Celestynowa near Otwock.

The woman was seen in the forest of Marysieńka near Głubczyce, in Celestynów near Otwock, near Łódź and in the mausoleum in Wałbrzych. The amazing thing is that all independent stories are combined by a description of the character and a doll without eyes, as well as a description of the situation.

The reader of zjawiskaniewyjasnione.pl website describes that he went through the forest with a girl in the evening. There was a doll without eyes on the forest road. The girl picked her  up and then she heard a low woman's voice ""leave my child"". An elderly woman came out of the blackness of the forest, who began to sway the doll and sing her terrifying lullaby about a child without hands and feet. When the couple shook off the initial shock, first walk and then run running away from the forest.

There is of course more history, and the common connection is a terrifying older woman, whose behavior always focuses on the form of a doll without eyes.

Since then, half of VMRO's leadership have been put on trial. Mickovski hasn't had time to really establish himself as a political force and in any case VMRO don't have the state machine (and public adminstration...) on their side any more.

SDSM won't get 2/3 themselves - no one has ever done that - but I can see them and the Albanian parties getting there. Obviously they haven't been all that popular as a government, but they did wipe the floor with VMRO at last year's local elections.",,/r/europe/comments/9k7sd4/former_yugoslav_republic_of_macedonia_name_change/e6yfplj/,JD74,1538377372
