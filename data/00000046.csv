That the UK shouldn't uphold human rights in a third country where we have a treaty guaranteeing human rights?  Baffling, petty and very sad. 

But don't let me tell you that: 

* Reinhard B√ºtikofer, chair of the European parliament‚Äôs delegation for relations with China,  branded the deal as a ‚Äústrategic mistake‚Äù. 


* ""The stories coming out of Xinjiang are pure horror. The story in Brussels is we're ready to sign an investment treaty with China,""said Guy Verhofstadt


* ""The political signal is disastrous. This deal mocks the concentration camps and enslavement of a people,"" said French MEP Rapha√´l Glucksmann. ""I will be active in organizing opposition to this deal. If [EU leaders] think that ratifying this deal will be like posting a letter, they are gravely mistaken.""  - Further to this, one of the French trade ministers said they'd veto this deal.

Regarding Tibet, prior to 1949 the United Kingdom was the only country in the world to recognise it as an independent nation. You must have the UK confused with someone else. The UK has continued to be highly critical of Chinese occupation. Frankly the UK wasn't really trading with China prior to the turn of this millennium (other than in the context of Hong Kong), I'm not sure where you got that from.

67,"&gt;the problem with blackface does not lie with intent, nor with experience of black people, but with effect. blackface piet creates a dominant stereotype that enables racists to dehumanize and discriminate against coloured people.

No, it doesn't. The character is really seen as an entity sui generis by young children, they see it more like a type of clown - they do no see it as representing all Africans. It does not enable racists to discriminate, racists can discriminate just fine with anything they find on their path. For example, monkey is a far more prevalent racist slur, should we ban monkeys? And would that stop racism? No.

&gt;Again, racists are free to be racists, but government sanctioned and funded festivities in public space are not the place for that. take your racism indoors please.

The Sinterklaas festival is not racist. Don't beg the question. If it's racist, bring it to court, we have laws for that. If it isn't, stop suppressing the culture of specific ethnicities in the country.

&gt;as a limburger, you might sympathize with coloured people in their battle against zwarte piet. not too long ago, the caricature of a limburger was a slow and dumb, and this caricature was so prevalent in tv shows and commercials that people still congratulate me for not sounding like a limburger (as if that is a positive thing). luckily, the limburg language has found recognition, and the caricature is not very powerful anymore. Zwarte piet, however, is. even though you might not see what is wrong with it.

Again, Zwarte Piet does *not* represent all Africans. It's a specific named character that belongs in a very specific context and story, not a generalized stereotype.

You can easily tell because the racist stereotype of the African is dumb, lazy, aggressive and ragged clothes. Zwarte Piet is capable, energetic, friendly and dressed up. He's pretty much the opposite. Ironically, the typical gangsta rapper is much closer to racist stereotypes, but the same woke crow that disapproves of Zwarte Piet thinks that's just fantastic.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/kr70bs/this_night_in_spain_the_three_wise_men_los_tres/gieugtg/,silverionmox,1610014546

I definitely think that farming industry will undergo some massive changes in the near future.  I would expect vertical farming for a wide range of simpler products such as lettuce, with tradition farms focusing more on sustainable production and higher quality ""luxury"" products.  I think a more agroecological approach will be more common, with government funding going to farms that produce in a sustainable manner instead of through the use of wasteful fertilizers.

171,"&gt; What? Have you even been part of this at all? Look at the sub I linked, back in spring/early summer. Literally one of the most toxic places on reddit. People were butthurt over a character getting killed by a woman, and resorted to transphobia to shit on that character (which in no way was a transvestite). 

Thats only when you believe whatever gaming journalists and TLOU2 stans think about those who disliked it. You should check that sub again since I couldn't find anything sexist or transphobic.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Incorrect. There are lots of games out there which contain gay themes. TLOU1, for example. 

But did TLOU1 get negative reviews. What about hate?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; But there is zero evidence for that being the case? 

Imagine yourself working for a gaming journalist. There is a lot of discussion about LGBT representation in gaming, seeing it as a positive thing which it is. But now comes this sequel that looks good, but is inconsistent and a terribly written story. But the game is well known even before release for repressenting LGBT values, lots of famous feminist advocates working with the game. Would you have the courage to give it a bad review?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Reviewers liked the game. So did most players. 

Some reviewers might, but a lot of them don't want to lose their jobs during a pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The game got negative review-bombed before even being released. 

That is because the story got leaked by suppossedly a former ND employee. People then became aware of the poor writing before the game released.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/kr1hgc/countries_directly_or_indirectly_mentioned_in_red/gieoa1k/,Tszemix,1610008564

It was a once in a generation referendum. You hold major nation changing referendums like that as little as possible for a reason, because the results can change life in a major way for everybody. 

The reason why they are then quite clearly described as once in a generation, is to avoid creating a situation where you just keep repeating a referendum until you get the result you want.

It would be incredibly damaging to democracy in the U.K. if we held another referendum so soon.

Hypothetically, let‚Äôs say we do hold another, and this time independence wins. How would they have the legitimacy to actually carry out the result...? You have already made a precedent that if the slightest thing materially changes, then a new referendum is necessary because the people might have changed their minds.

The only way this new referendum could actually be justified would be if it required enough of a majority that revisiting it a few months later would be a pointless endeavour. Set the Yes side at needing 70% of the vote to actually win.

338,"You are right. Somewhere in 1920s Orthodox churches acknowled that the Julian calendar is off, and not accurate anymore. So they hired Milankovic to develop a new one.
He did, and on the meeting where the churches were supposed to accept the new one, some refused - namely Russian, Serbian, Georgian, Armenian...etc... Rest did accept like Greek and Bulgarian church.
So today some Orthodox churches follow old, Julian Calendar, some follow Milankovic calendar. Which is important for Christmas, but not Easter, because Easter is determined after the Moon...
Fun fact is that right now, Gregorian calendar, used by all of us in day to day life and Catholic Church, is equal to Milankovic Calendar.

That's a federation ‚Äî that's the distinguishing characteristic between the a confederation and a federation.  Well, okay, technically it's where sovereignty is vested, but if you can withdraw, you're necessarily only delegating powers and can take them back, which makes the member state sovereign.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation

&gt;Since the member states of a confederation retain their sovereignty, they have an implicit right of secession.

The EU is presently still a confederation ‚Äî it still has Article 50, the withdrawal mechanism.

There are some practical reasons, like Eurozone membership, why it might be costly to withdraw, but they have the legal right to do so at this point.

People dont care. As long as their needs are met, they wont care enough about these things, to uproot their lives and governments.

Thats the cruel truth of the matter. It doesnt matter if someone 'hates this'. Not doing anything about it, is the same as complying. And no, typing angry comments doesnt count as doing something. Creating better governments is how you solve this, not typing angry comments that 'china sux'.

This wont change until the governments are thrown out, which wont happen because people whose needs are being met wont commit to anything as extreme as 'new politicians'.

There was a quote from some nazi general post WW2, about how letting minorities(other cultures or groups of people, in this context) die one after the other, will mean there wont be left anyone to stand up to you, when they come for you, but i cant find it right now.

Then Prime Minister [Cameron promised an EU referendum in 2013](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21148282), they had a full year of warning about the possibility of Brexit yet still voted to stay. Scotland accepted the risk of union wide constitutional change so Brexit is a mute point for another referendum when they had warning of the possible change. 

The UK constitution isn't codified in a signal document, it means it's based on a series of laws, assumptions and precedents which is why people are saying there shouldn't be another referendum until 2035 (the  assumption view) or 2055 (the precedent view) .

935,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union should send coronavirus vaccines to its Balkan neighbours and do more to combat the virus in Ukraine, 13 of the EU‚Äôs foreign ministers said in a joint letter to the bloc‚Äôs executive on Wednesday.

Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Sweden said the EU would not be safe from COVID-19 until countries on its borders could also recover from the pandemic.

‚ÄúWe strongly support the efforts and initiatives by member states and the European Commission to share the vaccines from the allocated contracts with the closest EU neighbours, such as the Western Balkan countries,‚Äù the ministers said in the Jan. 6 letter, which was made public.

Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said separately that it was ‚Äúour duty to extend a helping hand to EU partners in the east, Western Balkans and other regions‚Äù.

EU countries launched a mass COVID-19 vaccination drive on Dec. 27, but Balkan nations - poorer than EU member states - have not been able to negotiate the same access to COVID-19 vaccines with drugmakers. Other neighbouring governments have no clear schedule for their national inoculation programmes.

The European Commission said it received the letter and would reply to those governments, telling reporters in a regular news briefing that it was looking at ways to help Balkan countries and other neighbours, including Georgia and Ukraine.

The six Balkan countries of Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, all of which apart from Albania emerged from the 1990s break-up of Yugoslavia, are considered future EU members.

On a personal note; I really enjoy Russia's rich history and it's warm people and I think it's a shame a lot of western people disregard what it has to offer.

It may have almost worked on that occasion but Jobbik will need to do more to convince me that they purged the hardliners from their ranks.

Even more so, both religious leaders and followers, especially within the Catholic church use their religious beliefs to attack and condemn other people who do not subscribe to their ideology. Even to the extent of accusing LGBT people of the very acts they themselves are guilty of committing. 

If anything, it's not harsh enough. The Catholic Church itself is a horrible institution that has been complicit in some of the most horrible atrocities that humanity has ever experienced. This is just the tip of the iceberg and the fact that they continue to cover up their own heinous acts while condemning others for less shows exactly where their so called ""morals"" lie.",,/r/europe/comments/krjfyv/germany_catholic_officials_ask_reporters_for/gibcvai/,bttrflyr,1609949572

Your original claim was that he gave real evidence. He did not.

&gt;You went to a thread and immediately ruled out a discussion because the person posting it was a racist piece of shit.

I didn't post my comment under a random commetnr in this post. I called out the hypocrisy of a known racist. I was neither questioning the validity of the claim nor commenting on the issue itself.

My comment was not ""This claim is false because the commenter is a racist"", but ""This person is a hypocrite because he is a racist"".

&gt;It is also partially why Turks in Europe had a hard time integrating. 

Sure, it has nothing to do with the xenophobic ""we are superior"" bullshit mentality ingrained in Turkish nationalist mentality.

Not a German, read the flair.

&gt;Stop using mental gymnastics to justify yourself. You knew what you were doing when you tried to discredit his point. The dogwhistling part comes in because you tried to signal that since there was discrimination in Turkey, Turks deserve discrimination elsewhere.

It is mind-boggling how you accuse me of what you are guilty of. You're inserting intentions where there is none. I am sure you have more productive things to do than coming to the aid of some racist dipshit.

&gt;I have a one dimensional view because I don't want immigrant kids to be discriminated against? Or because I pointed out your hypocrisy about minority rights is just as evident as his?

The one dimensional comment was in response to your ""your criticize Turkey, so you're obsessed with Turks"" comment.

I don't know how me calling out the hypocrisy of a Turkish Nazi when it comes to ""minority rights"", as you put it, can be construed as ""being for discrimination against Turks"".

&gt;We don't call every German Nazis, we just call the Nazis Nazis.

And there's a reason for that. If Germans still used the word ""Jew"" as a slur, praised Hitler and his henchman, justified what has been do to the Jews, we'd still be calling Germans Nazis.

&gt; At the same time, all your responses to me are ""pfft you are Turk-centric, pfft you are a nationalist"", debate the topic, not the person. 

Turco-centric and nationalists were criticism of you, not the topic at hand and frankly given that you have been debating me for  2 days not only ""defending"" a racist dipshit but also interpreting my history of criticizing Turkish nationalism as ""racism against Turks"", you can't really expect me to see you as anything but a Turkish nationalist.",Dersim,/r/europe/comments/kqjvmd/biontech_founders_t√ºreci_and_≈üahin_on_the_battle/gia0buo/,cervanto96,1609913728

&gt;Istanbul Security Branch Directorate teams raided 24 addresses in 13 districts at 05:00. It was learned that the operation was carried out in front of the South Campus Main Entrance Gate of Boƒüazi√ßi University due to the action ""We do not want a trustee rector to our university.""  
&gt;  
&gt;During the action, it was reported that an operation was carried out to arrest 28 people, as they resisted the police and ""opposed to Law No. 2911"". 17 people were detained in the raids.  
&gt;  
&gt;Deputy Minister of the Interior ƒ∞smail √áataklƒ± said about the action at Boƒüazi√ßi University, ‚ÄúAs of now, there were 17 detentions. Only 2 of these 17 people taken into custody are students of Boƒüazi√ßi University. Among the 17 detainees, there are also those with organizational records including MLKP   


I could do an actual translation myself, but why bother, its pretty clear. Just understand that action and protest are homonyms in Turkish (eylem), so google translates protest as action (Due to the action= due to the protest). Those two kids are not just simply arrested, but are taken into custody.

Oh, btw Law no 2911 is about the right to protest. If I am lying, I am dying.

Without concrete plans on who goes where and does what, Poland shouldn't do a damn thing.  *First* NATO should signal to Russia that if it moves against the Baltics, they will lose Kaliningrad. Western Europe and the USA need to have plans and commitments ready for war in case it happens, and they need to be willing to use them.

Otherwise we'll send an army to help the Balts, and then no one will be there to help us when Russia turns its attention to Poland.

To control the masses. Quick, what does the dark ages of Europe and current age of Middle East have in common?

&gt;  a political one  

Hahahaha, you already know.

To the guy above you:

&gt; You can see that every single religion preaches patience towards suffering, a reward after a punishment or something like that. 

Yeah, while the religious leaders rake in MILLIONS and live like kings while preaching patience for the millions of people they rob. How convenient.

&gt; Religions being stupid doesn't mean anything. 

Yes it does. It means it is stupid. It means it creates a lower class dependent on wishful thinking to even go on living. 

&gt; Believing on the existence of a benevolent greater being who will help you at your greatest peril is such a relieving thought and probably is what makes some people actually continue to live 

Yeah, about that. That is how you get the poor to accept their suffering as a preplanned greater good with ZERO proof. This is a method of ""how to rob the masses"".  It's called a scam. That is how you rape someone's kid (Looking at you, literally every single religion) and still get them to believe you are a saint. 

Look man, you can believe Hogwarts will send you an owl and accept you as a wizard if it makes you happy, but that does not make it true. Or useful.

1544,"I would just like to say, while mathematically, this is correct analogy, the diminishing return theory and big number shows that in real world- there is a certain ‚Äúnumber‚Äù where the difference between powers is not as great of a difference. 

For example, The Netherlands with 20 million people will never be able to match China or really do any major damage. But a nation like Germany with 80 million people, 3T economy, will be less then equal but it will hurt China MUCH more than just the ratio of 80m/1400m or 3T/14T

This is why in WW, Germany was able to amount a force strong enough to fight France UK and Russia on all sides- while a century ago, France was the one fighting UK, Spain, Prussia-Austria, Russia on all sides. This is also why Europe is much more powerful than many nations- having 5 countries with more than 50 million people each is MUCH stronger in total than having a single nation with 250 million. (Think of it like this, If america split into 3 countries of equal share, the total power of these 3 nations would be more than the total power of the 1 america with same resources and people)

TL;DR: while mathematically, Germany/China is more or less Netherlands/Germany, in real world, big numbers start losing equivalent power at certain even points. So, while 1400 million Chinese fighting 80 million Germans is Equivalent to 18 Chinese fighting 1 German, in the real world, the former is somehow much better for Germany than the later senerio even tho the ratio is the same. Usually the real life ‚Äúthis nation can be really strong if it wanted‚Äù is around 50-200 million mark. After that, power that comes from adding more people has diminished returns.",,/r/europe/comments/kr6uoc/we_need_a_real_policy_for_china_germany_ponders/gi9stw7/,JoeWelburg,1609909109

1599,"UK (and I'm sure Ireland) would beg to differ. 

It's still pretty shocking to be honest when it's done in a caricature style. I've never seen the Asian King treated the same way and they were meant to be from the East, although let's be honest the Bible isn't exactly clear on this. 

I live in Spain and I don't mind too much if people try to emulate a nationality/ethnicity faithfully and realistically when they don't have someone who can play that part. I can completely understand that in little villages and most kids I've seen think of Balthazar as their favorite. But seriously, go look at some of the representations of him and they remind me of racist cartoons from 60 years+ ago or the black and white minstrels. I've seen faces blacker than any living human (haven't seen them pick a paler guy or have darker toned guys going paler to ""represent Europe"" but maybe that happens) and big red protruding lips. The jokes about him I've heard are also black stereotype jokes. We all know the ones I'm referring to. 

In my first year in Spain the family I was living with pointed at a group of black people and said they were now my new family. They had a good long hard laugh together about it. Presumably the idea of staying with a black family to them was unthinkable. I was honestly a bit bemused until I realised what they were actually saying. The father was the mayor of the town.

They showed me pictures of the three kings in spaceships (not a mistake, spaceships) and the depiction of Balthazar was suitably alien to me.

Spanish football has incidents about descriptions of black footballers and, like in some other countries in Europe, there are things that happen that in the UK wouldn't just be brushed under the carpet.

I'm not saying the UK doesn't have problems with race or the treatment or perception of immigrants or Muslims etc. (see Boris Johnson and Brexit for reference). But the amount of times someone in Spain says to me ""it's not racist"" and later tells me some untrue stereotype that I haven't heard from anyone younger than my Nanna is deflating.

The most common thing I hear is that it isn't a problem. That it is a problem in America. That in itself is very problematic. In the UK I think many people know it's something we could do better. In Spain many people don't or they actively avoid making simple changes.",,/r/europe/comments/kr70bs/this_night_in_spain_the_three_wise_men_los_tres/gi9xc53/,robertobaggio20,1609911750

1. Melchior represents Europe. And most of the times is represented by a white old man with white beard

2. Gaspar represents Asia. And most of the times it is represented by a white dude whit brown beard (so yeah no asians here, but sometimes in pictures he is represented as persian)

3 Baltasar represents Africa, and that's why he's black

The tradition of different races started in the XVth century and they represent the three traditional races in the european mindset of that time:

1. Melchior represents Europe. And most of the times is represented by a white old man with white beard

2. Gaspar represents Asia. And most of the times it is represented by a white dude whit brown beard (so yeah no asians here, but sometimes in pictures he is represented as persian)

3 Baltasar represents Africa, and that's why he's black

They're heading in the same direction as many other brands, making soulless hunks of steel instead of cars, with the brands and names we grew to love thanks to their legacies.

Cars are split into two in my opinion. On one side, absolutely ecstatic driving machines, and vehicles meant for the sole purpose of going from A to B. Jeep went from the former to the latter, despite having grown thanks to its offroaders.

Of course, people will buy cars regardless, but that's not the point I'm getting at.

You can amass all the money in the world, but if you're making cars like this, you will never appeal to the enthusiasts, which are much more than a grassroots community these days, but instead, to the soccer moms et cetera, which I will infer as the company knowing who buys their cars, and pertaining to them as such.

1778,"This is a sinister misrepresentation of the truth. It is close enough to the truth that it is more dangerous than an outright lie.

Before the 1980 coup: The university senate would hold an election and choose their own rector

What the 1980 coup did: Got rid of that system, allowed the president to appoint rectors from a list, 2 of whom came from senates, and 4 of whom came from government board. (YOK)

1992 Law: The presidential power to have the final say was kept, BUT the government ""candidates"" were removed. Basically, the senate chose the top 3 candidates and presented them in the order of preference (based on votes). The president risked backlash if they went against the top candidate. It happened, but rarely. It was a decent compromise, although full independence would have been better.

What Erdogan did: Got rid of the elections. There is not even the right for the university senate to hold a vote for a preference. YOK is allowed to present a ""recommendation"" list, but usually does not. The law wasn't even changed, it was an emergency decree in 2016 as a response to the attempted-coup.

TLDR: Erdogan most definitely took away the regained independence of universities. The universities controlled the candidate pool, and presented the top 3 most qualified candidates, so even if a president chose a lower-ranking candidate, it wasn't this bad.

&gt;I think you don't understand what I mean. Those vaccines wouldn't have been produced earlier. We would get them at the same rate.

We would have got 500 M instead of 200 M from earlier production.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We ordered 160M.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the EU only ordered 80 million doses. It has an option for another 80  million, but they wouldn‚Äôt be manufactured until a later date. ""We could  have provided more,‚Äù says St√©phane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, saying it  could have been up to 300 million doses. But he said the EU didn‚Äôt want  more.

&gt;Oxford/AstraZeneca has much lower efficacy than the mRNA vaccines, with it you have approximately 6 times the risk to fall sick.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It would still be good. It won't get approved if it is inefficient or harmful.  
&gt;  
&gt;The rest dont matter.

A factor 6 in risk does matter in my view.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The point is the EU didn't know which one would be the best. It bought many vaccines from many companies. We got covered 150M people with Pfizer/BioNTech, 80M with Moderna and another 200M with AstraZeneca/Oxford.  
&gt;  
&gt;We won't run out of Pfizer before we get the others, so it doesn't matter if we bought just 300M.

40 M of those Moderna only later. It does matter when the shots are delivered and how effective they are.

&gt;Considering thousands a dying each day that is not ""pretty soon"" in my view.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Choose which is the best:  
&gt;  
&gt;\-buying 600M Pfizer that would be all delivered by the end of the year, maybe even later with fewer vaccines from other companies that would deliver them quicker  
&gt;  
&gt;or  
&gt;  
&gt;\-buying 300M Pfizer that would be delivered by the middle of the year and 560M doses from other companies that would also be delivered by mid-year or autumn

Are you serious? Do you really think Biontech/Pfizer would deliver all shots later if we had ordered more earlier?

And again a false dichotomy: Ordering more from Biontech/Pfizer had not prevented us from ordering from other companies.

Of the 560 M doses from other suppliers only 160 M have an efficacy similarly high as Biontech/Pfizer, as we know now. And for the 2nd half of those 160 M it is most likely it will come only in the second half of the year according to Der Spiegel.",,/r/europe/comments/kquo5l/eu_rejects_criticism_for_slow_vaccine_rollout/gi8c5go/,mepeas,1609884521

1899,"The author of this piece, [Perry Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Anderson), is described by Wikipedia as

&gt;a British intellectual and essayist. His work ranges across historical sociology, intellectual history, cultural analysis. What unites Anderson's work is a preoccupation with Western Marxism.

&gt;Anderson is perhaps best known as the moving force behind the New Left Review. He is Professor of History and Sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Anderson has written many books, most recently The Antinomies of Gramsci and The H-Word: The Peripeteia of Hegemony, both published in 2017. 

I was astonished to see see this extremely erudite but also extremely hostile essay on the history and nature of the institutions of the European Union in the [*London Review of Books*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Review_of_Books), most of whose readers can safely be assumed to have voted to remain in the EU.

\&gt;&gt;

&gt;Stop bashing the USA and by proxy defending actual countries with a lack of Freedom of Press.

I absolutely hate that line. If I ""bash"" North Korea am I defending China? Can I not criticize North Korea then.

&lt;&lt;

He explained what he means with by proxy defending actual countries with a lack of freedom of Press, it was his first lines :

""I said that in the context of YOU...""

He didn't say that if you bash North Korea you are defending China.This is your strawman argument, you are trying to imply he holds a position which he doesn't.

&gt;How am I equivocating exactly? In another of my comments I point out that Russia murders journalists. I don't think that's equal to arrest.

You assume he read your other comments ?Instead you should assume he only knows what he replies to and how you reply to that.

&gt;However you seem to be offended at me simply mentioning that the arrest of journalist EXISTS in the US.

Where did you get that idea from ? He had been very transparent about the arrests of Journalists and was the first to argue that Arresting is not Imprisoning.**This is another example of you strawmaning him.**

&gt;No I'm not. I never mentioned those countries once. In fact I even said those countries on the list were worse than america in one of my comments. Are you simply choosing to lie now?

1. It is pretty obvious he mentions those countries as they were part of the Original Post and infact the worst offenders.
2. Again stop assuming he reads all your other comments.

&gt;It's not a strawman. To repeat what I said (without using specific countries then) and I want you to answer it, how is criticism of one country by proxy defense of another?

His comment says it.

&gt;I said that in the context of YOU trying to equivocate ""American journalist being arrested for a couple of days"" with ""274 Journalists being imprisoned for years/unspecified amount of times and charged in countries with lack of Freedom of Press"".

What that means is that it is incredible disingenous and dangerous for compairing a country arresting a Journalist for simply being present on a protest and not dispersing ( USA )  to a country which imprisons Journalists without trial ( China ).

Alternatively... There is a huge gap between pushing someone for not leaving after being asked to, and killing someone because he looked at you.If you try to compare both instances, you are making light of the murder.

&gt;Awesome, really shows how in the right you are. Don't get too red faced and angry now.

1997,"You are confusing terms here.

Standard language is just the language/dialect that everybody in a country or language community speaks, either as their first language, or in addition to their local dialect. In some places (e.g. England), it was established organically, in others (including Croatia) it was by a conscious decision of people who were influential enough to convince everybody else to accept their choice.

What you are talking about is the literary norm (written and spoken), which is more codified than the spoken standard language, and is less tolerant of local color, sound reductions, etc. It's the register used in written media and when spoken in official situations.

In any case, in standard ≈†tokavian, unlike in e.g. Slovenian, the literary norm closely follows the Eastern Herzegovinian dialect, which hasn't been just the dialect of Eastern Herzegovina for a very long time. By 1850, it was already spread over most of Bosnia, parts of Serbia, and much of Croatia. This happened through migration and koineization, not through local divergence. Consequently, Eastern Herzegovinian (and neo-≈†tokavian in general) was  much less diverse than the other dialects, and has become even more widespread and even less diverse since it became the standard language.

For neo-≈†tokavian speakers writing in the literary norm means simply writing down their own speech using the orthography they were taught in school and avoiding words that they know are colloquial, just like for e.g. English-speaking Americans.",,/r/europe/comments/kqa7i5/dialect_map_of_former_yugoslavia/gi7v5hd/,7elevenses,1609877952

2194,"&gt; Russia invaded Ukraine once semi-friendly government was replaced not by elections, but by force with openly hostile government.

that is according to Russian view and Russsian exucse, they can view things however they want. Europe and Western World saw it differently. Doesnt change the fact that they had planned it long in advance,  meaning they were lying and scheming and crating aggressive attack on their supposed friendly nation . 

Also I dont think you got me right the first time.......the operation to take over Crimea was not something that appear after Ukrainian events of 2014, it was activated immediately when Yanukovych has been ousted, meaning it was ready and waiting and prepared long long before Maidan protests when pro-Russian government was still in charge. Just the nature of military operations like that mean it has been prepalend long before the revolution/turnover of the government had even happened, so yea.

If the median wage is much lower than the mean wage it means that a specific part of the top 50% has a higher % of the total high wages. hence unequality between the very high earners and the working class.

Of course for both it could also mean you have a very very veyr poor lower class. But thats irrelevant. A stable country is a country that keeps the majority of its population content.

To give some context;
In some villages village ruler votes for the rest of the village etc. Some Kurdish families held immense power and can decide which party to support (and nominate a family member to that party)parties try to gain their support usually, because there is no city-like unknown voting there.

Just Google turkish election frauds there are so much videos of one men stamping thousands ballots to akp in open room (proudly too).

And tbh Black sea villages are similar as well. Some families even held places of power in provinces even from the Ottoman Empire. Same family two party candidates. Some shoots the other candidates in some provinces etc. 

What Turkey has is not only a Kurdish issue but also a land reform issue. I have met, befriended and worked with hundreds of Kurds and i am also half Circassian. And they all had to move to western provinces due to the lack of jobs in their hometowns (some complained about traditional values as well, we still have honor killings in some provinces, if you accidentally bump someone you might get a full out family blood feud whereas here two people apologize at the same time.) Same for Anatolians, Black sea provinces as well. Everyone moves to ƒ∞zmir, Ankara and ƒ∞stanbul, and you get traffic, rent, industrial problems etc.

It means that Russia pretended to be all frinedly and nice towards Ukraine for all these 25 years since the fall of USSR (they were both CIS members), yet at one nice day it was revealed they had planned and practise a entire takeover operation against that supposedly friendly nation and just waited for an opportunity to do so.

The scientist from the UK has warned that COVID-19 vaccines could be ineffective against the highly infectious variant that was found in South Africa.

&gt;Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, said that he is now worried about the South African Coronavirus variant due to the fast-spreading nature.

&gt;Bell told Times Radio, on Monday, January 4: ""The mutations associated with the South African form are really pretty substantial changes in the structure of the protein."" He added that the vaccines might still work against the variant found in Kent, UK, but was not sure about the **South Korean** variant ‚Äî ""there's a big question mark about that"".

Funny how you forgot to mention that even as you liberated us you gave chunks of land predominantly bulgarian to Romania and Serbia, so we would have a conflict claims with them. 

Funny how when Bulgaria reunited with Eastern Rumelia, Russia called back it's officers from the Bulgarian army and insisted on Turkey attacking us.

Funny how after we defeated Serbia, Russia instated a coup against our kniaz, because he united the two Bulgarian states.

Funny how later on during the Balkan wars Russia promised to guarantee Vardar Macedonia to Bulgaria and mediate for the rest of Macedonia, but threw back it's word.

Funny how in WW1 you tried to invade us and then claim we fought against you.

THE FUNNIEST is how you try to claim that Russia fights for freedom when you started WW2 together with NAZI GERMANY as ALLIES. We never declared war on you in ww2.

2633,"In the EU,17.2% of the population were living in overcrowded households in 2019, meaning they did not have enough rooms compared to the size of the household. Overcrowded households can feel even smaller with kids playing in the same room as parents trying to telework during the coronavirus lockdown. Moreover, overcrowded environments can present a higher risk of spreading the virus.

On the other hand, staying home alone for days on end brings its own set of challenges as well. In the EU, more than one in three persons (32.7%) lived in under-occupied dwellings in 2019, meaning that the dwellings were deemed to be too large, in terms of excess rooms and more specifically bedrooms, for the needs of the household living in it.

**Overcrowding rate falling slightly in countries with the highest rates**

Among the EU Member States, almost half the population in Romania (45.8%) were living in overcrowded households in 2019. This was also the case for around two in every five persons in Latvia (42.2%), Bulgaria (41.1%), Croatia (38.5%) and Poland (37.6%). Compared to the previous year, the share of the population living in overcrowded dwellings fell slightly in all of these countries, with the strongest fall recorded in Poland (-1.6 pp).

At the opposite end of the scale, the lowest overcrowding rates were recorded in Cyprus (2.2%), Ireland (3.2%), Malta (3.7%) and the Netherlands (4.8%).

**Seven in ten persons living in under-occupied dwellings in Malta, Cyprus and Ireland**

In 2019, almost three quarters of the population were living in under-occupied dwellings in Malta (72.6%), Cyprus (70.5%) and Ireland (69.6%). In Spain (55.4%), Luxembourg (54.0%), Belgium (53.9%) and the Netherlands (53.4%) more than half of the population were living in dwellings deemed too large. From 2018 to 2019, the share of the population living in under-occupied dwellings decreased in most of these countries except in Luxembourg which recorded a small rise (+0.3 pp), with the most pronounced drop in Belgium (-4.7 pp).

In contrast, less than 15% of the population were living in dwellings deemed to be too large in Romania (7.7%), Latvia (9.6%), Greece (10.7%), Bulgaria (11.5%), Croatia (12.0%), Slovakia (14.0%) and Italy (14.2%).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/kqsc1t/in_the_eu_172_of_the_population_were_living_in/gi5m90l/,filosoful,1609827722

2680,"TO BE FAIR:

Majority of Europeans' interactions with Turks are migrant-workers. These were (and still are) the uneducated masses of Turkey from the 80s. They are selfish, ignorant, uneducated and self-righteous (These are the traits of every lower class in the world, see - Brexiteers, Evangelicals, Neonazis etc). They faced systematic discrimination and ghettoisation (yes i just made that term up), so they became even more nationalistic than their counterparts in Turkey. Then it was just a nosedive. Those willing to educate themselves chose to assimilate into the culture and disassociate from the Turkish families. The most ignorant dug in their heels more and more and more. So they went from bad to worse.

So now, in Europe, you have the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the barrel. Ultra nationalistic ""Reis number one cCc"" crowd that, for some reason, just does not go back to Turkey even though it is (apparently) better than all of Europe. They talk of discrimination (which is real), but abuse the welfare and social aid system (which is also real). They complain about ""Christian dogma"" and ""forced cultural assimilation"" (biggest example: sex education in schools), but they push Islamic dogma in their communities.

The truth is, hijab (and AKP support) goes down as education level goes up. Which is why they hate education itself. If you want, check the Turkish universities in world ranking lists since 2003. Actually, don't bother, here is the link from an earlier time: [http://globaloutreachprogram.boun.edu.tr/?q=node/35](http://globaloutreachprogram.boun.edu.tr/?q=node/35)

There are severe cases: a person was hit by a train-the driver informs the dispatcher and then he himself urgently begins to pull the person out from under the train.

3020,"&gt;  A Christian can not be agnostic.

They can, in fact, be exactly that. Not every christian is so arrogant as to claim knowledge of things they can not possibly know no matter how much they stomp their feet to the ground while yelling that they do. 

In fact, the agnostic christian might well point out that someone who is absolutely ""certain"" because they ""know"" god exists is not a 'real' christian because they don't in fact have faith. If you believe in god because you *know* he exists, then you don't have faith; faith is believing even when you can not back that up with knowledge. 

ultimately it does not matter; we're talking literal definitions of terms here that are not subject to one's personal interpretation. 

Besides, that you personally believe christians *must* be like X is precisely the sort of problematic attitude that I imagine leads many agnostic christians to define themselves as such.

First Japan (since almost two decades ago) and then Eurozone and USA (simce almost a decade ago) have near-zero inflation or even deflation. If you have some level of inflation, the central bank can increase or reduce interest rates to stimulate or to suppress consumption. If there is deflation in the economy, central banks cannot stimulate consumption anymore because 

1.) Consumers tend to save more and postpone their consumption decisions because prices fall over time.
2.) Central Bank cannot reduce the interest rate below the inflation rate (or deflation rate, since it is negative) since a negative interest rate (both in real and nominal terms) would incentivize holding and using cash (that gives 0% interest rate).

As for the former, it is self-evident that acting appropriately is its own reward. It is certainly nobler not to expect some sort of a payment for it, and indeed complaining about petty national matters somewhat besmirches the memory of the fallen volunteers.

&gt;Yes, beyond all doubt, the destiny of a Russian is pan-European and universal. To become a true Russian, to become a Russian fully (in the end of all, I repeat), means only to become the brother of all men, to become, if you will, a universal man. All our Slavophilism and Westernism is only a great misunderstanding, even though historically necessary. To a true Russian, Europe and the destiny of all the mighty Aryan family is as dear as Russia herself, as the destiny of his own native country, because our destiny is universality, won not by the sword, but by the strength of brotherhood and our fraternal aspiration to reunite mankind.",,/r/europe/comments/kqclbp/january_4_1878_russian_troops_liberate_bulgaria/gi3owy7/,Humanophage,1609791043

\- It was illegal for a member of parliment to wear hijab during meetings.

\- If soldiers mother were wearing hijab they were banned to enter their sons oath ceremony

Now all this turn back to us as a otoritarian regime using religous values of people to make them fear from secularist opposition so getting votes whatever they do. But it seems like people start to understand that secularist changed.

The problem is Erdoƒüan now start using foreign attacks on Turkey to hold power. Using USA's support for PKK terrorist organization related groups to galvanize its base. Uses EU support for extensive Greek claims on Eastern Med to make people beilive only he can solve this, uses 2016 coup attempt by FET√ñ an islamic cultist group and how west protect them...

3213,"Thank you for the question :) NEA is exclusively oriented to civil application of nuclear energy and they mostly work with member states. On this part they are highly complementary to the IAEA, however the IAEA has more wide reach, not only by wider membership but they are more open to working with non-members. Also the IAEA does safeguards (inspections to ensure member states do not proliferate nuclear weapons) which is again complimentary to EURATOM, but interestingly enough the first non-proliferation efforts were under the NEA's umbrella as part of a tribunal on nuclear law (security convention). In the 70s the security aspect of it was scrapped and moved to the IAEA.

I am familiar with the work of these organisations from a legal point of view, so I know that NEA covers new builds, liability and safety mainly. The IAEA covers everything and EURATOM covers everything but on a European level exclusively. All three have different resources and databanks and due to the fact that they cooperate extensively they can concentrate on specifics.

The Finns basically *get* to succeed in this path due to geography. Finland isn't in the way of a potential Russian push towards the Carpathians, whereas Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Belarus would be. Thus, if independent, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia will always end up being adversarial towards Russia unless Russia isn't perceived as a threat.

The reality is that both Finland and Sweden are de-facto NATO. NATO cannot allow Russian influence in either nation because of missile defense issues, but at the same time Russia would not be able to tolerate a serious NATO presence in either nation (particularly Finland) as it'd be within spitting distance of St. Petersburg.

3385,"&gt;Well, the Finns have generally succeeded in this path.

It's pointless to compare Finland and Baltics as the circumstances are just way too different. For Finland, war with Soviets is remembered, but it's quite a distant past by now. For decades, Soviet Union was mostly a trade partner for them, even as their shadow loomed over Finland, Finns would live on their own. 

For the Baltics, Soviet Union was a country that took their freedom, that deported over 100 000 of their people, destroyed many local monuments and murdered many of their politicians, lawyers, diplomats, officers, cultural figures etc. In addition to that, there's a big Russian-speaking minority which Finland completely lacks, and which continues to be a source of tension every day.

&gt;if NATO's goal was only to protect these countries, then Russia would accept it 

Can you please explain what is the ""true"" purpose of NATO being in the Baltics then? If you follow NATO presence through the eyes of a military expert, it's not nearly enough to even resist a potential Russian invasion.

&gt;well, and if the Baltic states made some concessions on controversial issues 

Such as?

&gt;And by the way, what right do they have to teach Russia? 

We could ask your country the same.

3446,"It is a very basic concept in reality. Turks are not churned out of a ""BIRD COUNTRY FACTORY"" with a single mindset planted in all of them.

A lot of Turks in Germany are children (or grandchildren) of immigrant families that moved to the country to bolster workforce in 60s. Since Germany thought they would stay there only for a limited time until the economy has rebounded, they didn't think much about integration plans which eventually led to much more isolationist Turkish neighbourhoods that turned to conservatism &amp; nationalism. Turks in Germany have a much stronger religious &amp; nationalist identity compared to Turks who were born in Turkey and left for EU later on in their life. In most cases, this nationalist and conservatist mindset is exactly what they are running away from.

Sweden doesn't have a history of Turkish immigrancy so most Turks in Sweden are young people who want a better life. They find it much easier to adapt and develop a more flexible identity without frictions with Swedish community. All in all, Turks moving to Sweden do that because they want to live like Swedes, that's their motivation all along. A hijab-wearing young Turkish girl (like my sister, for example) is highly unlikely to want to go to Sweden, it is a matter of culture and how you live your life.

The local Armenians still have part of Nagorno Karabakh. They are still de-facto independent. They still don't have Azerbaijani passports, nor pay tax to Azerbaijan. The question is what happens to these people. From Russia's and France's perspective their status is still unresolved, in line with OSCE principles which includes self-determination. As it stands recognised independence is the only humane option, given that the regions Azerbaijan have captured in the most recent war were ethnically cleansed of Armenians, including beheadings and mutilations of civilians.

For permissions like that, you have to have a different control organisation.

I also understand your point about it being a waste to vaccinate otherwise healthy populations. However in the UK in particular there is no political appetite for the stricter measures such as lockdown/effective tracing, nor I think the public goodwill to go along with these long term. So our only hope is to raise the level of immunity in the population (general and at risk) as high possible to limit the rapid spread that we're currently seeing. I'm no data modeller but I imagine there are studies attempting to find the sweet spot of targeting particular vaccine types to particular groups to limit hospital admissions to a manageable level.

No it was not. It was carried out by small gangs of radical nationalists.

The history is twisted by both sides in order to support their own narrative. It is clear that both sides have their fair share of guilt. Armenians were killed and expelled from Azerbaijan.

FYI there are three parties to this conflict (Azerbaijan, Armenian, and the locals), the three of which signed the Bishhek protocol cease fire.  The 822 resolution you are quoting is referencing local Armenian forces. This isn't the same as the Republic of Armenia.  You'll note the UN requested role of the Republic of Armenia in later resolution 853 is to ""exert its influence to achieve compliance (ed:with 822) by the Armenians of the Nagorny-Karabakh"".

Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe mentioned in your quote is the CSCE which was later called the OSCE, which recognises the right of self-determination of the people of Nagorno Karabakh.  Do you support this resolution in full and thus support the OSCE process, including supporting self-determination? Or you do you just support the resolution piecemeal as it you like?

I was traveling from Stuttgart to Budapest via Munich, first stint with a German ICE second one with an Austrian railjet. Halfway to Munich my train just stopped because due to snow in Munich there was such chaos that there just wasn't a platform available. Next available regional train to Munich picked up a 20 minute delay on the first stop because one door was stuck open due to a frozen mechanism. This regional train terminated unscheduled at the first stop of the Munich city trains for the same reasons as the ICE before. So I made it to Munich after 4 instead of two hours and board the Austrian railjet. In Austria it snowed so much you couldn't differentiate between the ground and the sky because everything was one shade of white but the train was 2 minutes at every single Trainstation and I arrived in Budapest without any further delays...",Saxony (Germany),/r/europe/comments/kproee/intercity_train_moving_out_of_lienz_station_in/gi0hcbj/,ButcherIsMyName,1609719274

A few years ago, Movistar changed all the copper telephone lines in the municipality for fiber optics and they made us the new installation at home at no cost.  It was like going from night to day ...

It was possible because the government subsidized the installation of broadband in many municipalities where its installation was not profitable for companies. However, Movistar has said that it wants to get rid of all its copper cable infrastructure by replacing it with FTTH because its maintenance is more profitable (they will close many of the old telephone switchboards that are no longer necessary).

On the other hand, in the building where I work, Movistar also installed fiber optics on each floor at no cost to the owners, they only asked for permission.  Many years before Vodafone did the same with the HFC cable.

Finally I know that in my autonomous community, Cantabria, the Adamo company is deploying its own FTTH network to serve 100% of the towns in the region.

4187,"It's more that fossils are inefficient when producing electricity. Even in the most efficient coal plants half of the energy will be lost in heat. A diesel car uses at best a third of the energy in the diesel for propulsion. Electric motors however are more than 90% efficient. 

But if you burn the fossil fuels for heating, then heat obviously doesn't count as a loss. Hence you only have the losses due to transport. That's why burning gas for heating works quite well.

Heating directly with renewables would be a bad idea. But fortunately we don't have to do that. This is where heat pumps come in. They essentially work like a fridge, but with the outside being cooled and your house being warmed up. They get (IIrc, might be better now) about three joules of heat in your house for every joule they need in electricity. A problem with heat pumps is that they're (in the short run) more expensive than gas systems, and that they can't get the water as hot as fossil fuel based systems, so you'll have to insulate your house well, but they can also be rigged to cool things down in the summer.

4507,"Ok. this one is quite complicated. bur here we go, I'll try to make it as simple as possible.

""Musikverein"" is NOT the Venue. ""Musikverein"" is short for ""Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde Wiens"", which translates to ""society of the friends of music vienna"" (""Verein"" is a special legal form of society in austria, basically the same as a club"").
And the venue is their ""Konzerthaus"" (concert ""house"" or better hall).
The venue itself does not hold any copyright, but austrian public tv (ORF) does, since they produced the recording of the concert.
If BBC showed it as well, they licensed the broadcast in cooperation with austria public television (and also used the pictures/sound recorded by ORF).

Since ORF provides the concert as a free stream only available to austrian -ip adressses (quasi only people from austria) for a limited time (7 days) after the event, it is not allowed/licensed to other television broadcasters - and of course not YT.

This is the same with the ""summer night concert"" as well, but since the latter has a higher popularity, it is licenced to numerous tv broadcasters worldwide.

- big box stores(shopping mall) out competing smaller, local bussiness in traditional ""center"" districts, it's easier to make shopping in clean, large shopping center than on the ""shopping street"", especially when you are not living in the strict city center, it's impossible to raze low, historical building to make place for more densier modern highrises, thus there is necessity to spread population on larger areas.

- gentrification, turistisation of old town districts, ppl prefer to live in quiet ares, hotels and airnb are pushing rents up

- AGGRESSIVE pedestrianization makes living harder, especially for families. My family(2+3) was too poor to own a car in first 19 years of my life.

Because nobody's obsessed with their lineage as much as you are with Turkic lineage or Nazis with their Aryan lineage.

While Germany and Hitler's ideology collapsed in 1945 after losing WWII, Turkey avoided WWII and managed to carry on the same ideology to present day.  
  
As for Pontic Greeks, they may have Greek lineage but Anatolia was mostly colonized by Greeks, not settled in general.

&gt;I really dont agree, the tech and music markets are not comparable what works for one doesnt have to work for the other. Art is not science/engineering. Short term patents boost innovation, short term copyright does not.

&gt;Id rather have a musician spends a shitload of time perfecting their craft, than releasing uninspired trash every other year just to pay the bills. Being an average musician is already hard enough, if not for lifetime royalties I can imagine a lot of average musicians would have gone back to waiting tables or something because of lack of money. Instead of keeping on trying and finally releasing that killer album. This creates a feedback loop where being a musician becomes a less valued and secure job.Due to royalties, stellar musicians can also just end their career when they notice they cant keep up anymore, instead of cluttering their Spotify page with uninspired crap.

&gt;While for engineers the saying goes: ""Sometimes you just have to shoot the engineers and build the damned thing"". Which as an engineer, makes me glad that I am working from home right now. But I do agree with it. And to add, the licencing income from those patents goes to the company they work for 99% of the time. Not the engineer, so its not their source of income anyway.

If A chose the first option, B makes a claim and the video gets blocked unless A decides they want to unblock it. If A chose the second option, B makes a claim, video is still up but is demonetized until A decides if they want it to be only demonetized or block fully (and that would be kind of a case by case basis)

If only B is registered and A isn't then it would go like this: B makes a claim and they immedietaly decide if the video gets blocked or demonetize, they inform A about the decision and A can leave it as it is or register and change it

First of all I came to this conclusion not because i ***refuse*** to watch the video. I came to his conclusion because as you said :

&gt; I think I misinterpreted what that author said then. 

Second of all: ***REFUSE***?  That is just paranoid thinking. Its a  48minute video. I dont know how you spend your time, but I got more shit to do . Finding the 48min to watch the video might  take a couple of days. If you dont find this reasonable, and you find it more reasonable to accuse me of ***refusing*** to watch it for whatever reason, then you need to take a deep breath and reassess our conversation. Lets not forget that out of honesty in discourse, I did not reject your Res inter argument blindly, and gave it enough credit to ask a very fairly worded, ubiased and balanced question at r/internationallaw. I am in search of the truth, and not trying to win an inconsequential argument with a stranger on the internet, just so that I can feel better about myself. If thats your game, go play it with someone else.

&gt;  I will accuse you with the same thing that you have accused me; you ignore court decisions and decide to believe a random redditor claiming Kastellorizo will generate thousands of times more EEZ than Turkish mainland because it fits your view :) 

That is just childish. I ignore court decisions? I told you that I am not aware of any, and if you could please provide me with at least one. You couldnt provide one off the top of your head, and directed me to watch a 48minute video (fair enough). Which not only I told you I will do so when I can, but also mentioned it on all the next posts and didnt ignore it, apologizing and telling you that I will do it.  Your accusations are baseless and in bad faith, and frankly quite insulting. 

My will to continue this conversation with you is waning, but I will continue to do so, after I watch the video, because if I indeed stop talking to you at this point it will look more like intellectual cowardice , than frustration at your level of discourse.

As for the last part of your post, let me shatter any illusions of military supremacy on your part, although I am afraid that our already devolved conversation, might devolve even further into a pissing contest of who has the upper hand militarily? .

As for the length of copyright I have never seen anyone articulate a convincing argument for why they'd create more or better art because their grandchildren will be able to profit from it long after their death.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/kphdym/the_vienna_philarmonic_concert_posted_on_youtube/ghyaeue/,Vimmelklantig,1609682763

* In a blind test with 2741 UK citizens aged 18-55, half of the participants were given half a dose and subsequently a standard dose and the other half was used as control group. This lead to an efficacy of 90.0%. (Confidence interval: 67.4% to 97.0%) This group used self administered nasal swabs to test for asymptotic covid.
* In blind test with 4807 UK citizens half of the participants were given two standard doses and the other half was used as control group. This lead to an efficacy of 60.3%  (Confidence interval: 28.0% to 72.2%) This group used self administered nasal swabs to test for asymptotic  covid.
* In blind test with 4088 Brazilian citizens half of the participants were given two standard doses and the other half was used as control group. This lead to an efficacy of 64.2%  (Confidence interval: 30.8% to 81.5%) This group did use self administered nasal swabs to test for asymptotic covid

If you group the two last tests together, then you get an efficacy of 62.1% (confidence interval 41.1% to 75.7%).

The UK is not vaccinating more people. The UK is postponing the recommended second dose in order to provide a first vaccine dose to other people. Whether that actually saves lives is unclear. There is no data. They are guessing. They are crossing fingers. 

Vaccine efficacy is significantly lower with only one dose. For the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, vaccine efficacy with only one dose more than 21 days after vaccination is not known.

If you opponents time and time again find ways to make you look stupid, while you at least are supposed to have good ideas, then the mistake is less on them, but more on the incompetence of the group who is being misrepresented. Say what you will, but this problem seems rather localized with the Green Party and the FDP, both CDU and SPD seem to not suffer quite as much.

Besides, the Green Party has plenty of newspapers who are more than willing to provide them with a platform and are very much friendly towards their goals (the Zeit would be my prime candidate, as unlike f.e. the Taz it maintains an air of respectability and neutrality. Same goes for the Spiegel, which is rather aligned towards the Green Party).

There are many ways you can define some-one/thing as European. Some will check more boxes than others. I just think that if we would call Turkey European primarily, it would probably check one of the least if not least of the boxes to check of all European countries. 

It seems to me that from Turkey's side, they are aware that European influences are the strongest so they consider themselves to be European from that perspective. Other European countries see Turkey on the cultural and historical periphery of Europe with only smart part of the country in actual Europe, so they are more hesitant to call Turkey European.

There are separate words (compound words actually, ""moottoritie"" and ""maantie"") for highways and also the kind of roads outside cities which are paved and probably have a speed limit of 60-80 km/h but aren't actually highways. As separate from smaller country roads, whether paved or not. 

Come to think of it, I'm pretty sure I would always call the smaller country roads ""tie"" and not ""katu"", but like I said, there are streets (generally key/larger ones) in the city named ""tie"". And idiomatically I would say ""√§l√§ k√§vele keskell√§ katua"" - ""don't walk in the middle of the street"" to a kid even if it was a road.

It uses a borehole of 100-300m depth called heat well, heat source is geothermal, they are really efficient, and a shitload cheaper to use than district heating. 

They are so much cheaper than district heating, that people are replacing district heating with this geothermal heat pump solution. 

Can it really be that you are unaware of such a basic solution? It‚Äôs really common.

And as what comes to apartment blocks. I don‚Äôt know what kind of storage boxes do architects design there. But stairwells that are nice to use do take space. Not to mention space needed by piping, maintenance space, etc. 

And it does not matter anyways, the amount of heat needed to keep interior of an object at constant temperature  is dependent on external insulation. Internal structure does not matter.

Our car-hating policies are born out of politicians (with drivers!) who try to implement continental European solutions to fix problems we don't have here. They do it without considering the difference in population density and traffic levels.

Instead, the focus should be on developing and subsidising electric vehicles and remote work. That way we can live in and enjoy our amazing nature without negatively impacting it.

5264,"&gt; The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Blessed Virgin of Ta' Pinu (Maltese: Santwarju Ba≈ºilika tal-Madonna ta' Pinu) is a Roman Catholic minor basilica and national shrine located some 700 metres (2,300 ft) from the village of Gƒßarb on the island of Gozo, the sister island of Malta. The church is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin of Ta' Pinu. The basilica is located in open countryside which allows visitors to enjoy beautiful views of the area and is of great national importance to Gozitans everywhere.

&gt; The origins of the Shrine of Our Lady of ta' Pinu are unknown. It was first recorded in the archives of the Curia in Gozo, when the Bishop Domenico Cubelles paid a visit to the chapel. This noted that the chapel had just been rebuilt and that it belonged to the noble family of ""The Gentile"".[3]

&gt;In 1575 the apostolic visitor Pietro Dusina was delegated by Pope Gregory XIII to visit the Maltese Islands. In his pastoral visit to the church, he found that it was in a very bad state. He ordered the church to be closed and demolished and its duties passed to the parish church, now the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Gozo. When demolition began the workman broke his arm while striking the first blow. This was taken as an omen that the chapel should not be demolished. The church was the only chapel on the island to survive Dusina's decree ordering the demolition of other similar chapels.[3]

5345,"The pipes for the district heating has a fairly low loss, if it's well maintained, around 10%. That is comparable to the loss of well maintained electric networks (which is needed for heat pumps), that is 4-6%, depending on generation methods and distances.

If it has a heat pump in it, it is not geothermal. If it does not have a heat pump in it, than it will not help with the cooling at all, and it is not available everywhere, in fact not available to most places where people live. I can drill a 200m well and pump up cool (and horrible quality) water.

If the common areas are 20-30% of the total space, than that is a horribly designed apartment complex. They surely exist, but I don't believe those are typical. The budget of the apartmant complex is sent out every year here, and heating/lighting of is a fairly small fraction (they are lower than elevator maintenance).

You also disregards utility spaces in detached houses in rural places, and the extra space needed for sparse living, that are needed to substitute the lack of availability of services that are readily available in a city. Garages, larger kitchens and pantries, utility rooms for heating and house maintenance, all of which are not needed or less likely to have with an apartment.

Though the amount of non-living space though is completely irrelevant. Even if 50% of the internal space is wasted, the outside is still insulated (or at least can be) the same way a detached house can be. It is still more efficient, because some of the sides do have U 0 efficiency, and the ones towards wasted space are still better insulated than if they would be outer walls, as the wasted space will act as an additional level of insulation, and that itself is insulated to the outside.

Unless you can provide me with some source that whatever this heating solution you are planning is so much more efficient than cogenerated district heating, I can't believe that. Everything I found says otherwise, and puts it barely above gas heating. Unless it is truly geothermal (which based on your previous comments it isn't), but that is ""cheating"" not available for the majority of the people who live in colder climates.

We're talking about a situation when there is a road AND the sidewalk.

Talk is about weather the church is above the law and should force their staff to abide or they can do some proceedings on their own. Hopefully they are not above and that one will be settled. 

As I understand the same goes for ""religiously motivated extremist association"" without naming. Sad thing is that there is no need to name. There is not one people on this planet who did not store its head in its own ass for the last 10+ years who would not associate to lunatics of one religion. At least I haven't heard of methodists exploding themself for clerical differences.  

I strongly believe in Europe we fought long enough to curb the idiocy of our historic religions, not completely removing their bad influence on population, but at least they can not burn people for sciences, chopping hands for not paying 10ths etc.. I am on the opinion that we should not tolerate any religion to remove what we have achieved. 

I have absolutely no problem counting people with flat earth believes or priests who are feeding some ""flash"" to their flock, but order of the day is these lunatics are not exploding themselves neither teaching the greatness of such act to their followers. There is one particular religion where some of the lunatic imams are causing havoc and I see no problem singling them out until problem is not solved.

5658,"&gt; House made from wood is a carbon storage.

How many houses in Europe today are made from wood?

&gt;Apartment made from concrete is a CO2 producer

You can mitigate that by using something like hempcrete. Even so, because people are living more densely, even if the per building CO2 was higher the per person CO2 would be lower.

&gt;And then also the urban infrastructure requires huge amounts of additional concrete.

You would have more additional concrete if people didn't live in cities. Think about it, you not only need roads to travel within towns but between towns too, same goes for utilities. The fewer cities/town/villages there are the less additional infrastructure you need to go between those cities/town/villages, so grouping people in larger settlements is more efficient.

Every town also needs its own local doctor, supermarket, police station, library, church, Amazon delivery depot, etc. requiring more buildings and concrete, whereas in a dense urban environment all of those people could easily be served by one larger facility which would take up less space/concrete/etc. that the smaller ones combined.

Not to mention that every small-town shop or service would need a big concrete car park outside its multiple branches whereas in the city all it would need outside its one single branch is a bus stop.",These Islands,/r/europe/comments/koza5t/warsaw_is_reclaiming_space_from_cars/ghui6lx/,berejser,1609611049

5742,"&gt;That does not extend to a referendum on independence, but it could easily be used to - for example - hold a referendum on if the Scottish Parliament should request a referendum on independence.

That enters into the arguement of what exactly is meant by Union in the Scotland act 1998 which would most likely end up at the supreme court and it's hard to say how they'd legislate on that, and even then Westminster could change the law so that anything that even remotely relates to the union is considered a reserved matter 

&gt; And yet Northern Ireland is permitted a referendum every 7 years if polling demonstrates sufficient support. 

**GFA applies only to Northern Ireland** as NI is in a weird state where they're not a territory but can elect MPs to Parliament; it's a '[jurisdiction](https://www.quora.com/Is-Northern-Ireland-a-kingdom-a-state-a-country-a-nation-or-a-province)' for lack of a better term.
